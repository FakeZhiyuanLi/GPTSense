        I'm working on another quick turn around project   with  Father Benedict Groeschel , a book that will address the current crisis in the church and lay out a call to reform the church. Look for it to hit the bookstores in June.

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives.  Here is the twelth Step:     (12) Not to seek after pleasures.   This is not a popular counsel in our culture. We may be the most pleasure seeking culture that has ever existed.  Indeed it may well be that of all the maxims that St. Benedict gives us, this is the hardest.  I suspect some will find it nearly impossible to accept even intellectually.  St. Benedict here is not counseling and individual to reject pleasure when it is experienced but rather he is saying that one should  now seek after it .  Most of us actively look forward to experiences that we believe will give us pleasure based on our past experiences. As a child we looked forward to Christmas each year, because at an early age when gifted with presents that we had not expect, we were filled with pleasure. But something strange happens, when we start expecting the pleasure and actively seeking after it, the reality never seems to live up to our expectation.  The gift that we beg for arrives and quickly is seen for what it is--"a false advertisement". The elusive relationship is finally gained but the reality never lives up to the fantasy.   The wise person learns this at an early age, but most of us become more creative in our explanations as to why our plans for pleasure are failing to pleasure us.When we seek after pleasure it become unattainable. Nothing ever lives up to our expectation. The act of seeking is a guarantee that we will not achieve the pleasure that we desire.  The longed after vacation, when it arrives, moves to quickly and is destroyed by the delays in travel, the lousy weather, etc.  If we are wise we will find that pleasure comes when we do not desire it but simply are present to the events of the present moment.   Our expectation is that God can come to us at any moment and this expectation will lead to pleasures and joy that we can not dream of.    The seeker lives in the past. He or she is trying to  recreate the unplanned moment when everything seemed to be right. If  only the moment could be recreated the pleasure would once again be experienced.  But the reality is that that moment is past.   The reality is also that the future is ahead with all of its unexpectedness. “Seek first the Kingdom of God!” is the counsel of Jesus. Everything else is secondary. Everything else is illusion.  If I make it my goal to be totally present to the reality of  the moment, rather than to be focused on some illusory happiness that lies in the future,  I will find true joy right now.    The radical nature of this claim will find it’s confirmation when I am stuck in traffic or sitting in the waiting room of the doctor or dentist and I thank God for the extra time I have been given to relax, to read a magazine that I usually don’t have time for, to gently reflect on where God has led me in the past and how futile our my plans for anything without God’s co-operation.  “If the Lord does not build the house, in vain do the labors labor.”  The future is ours only in so far as it is the Lord’s also.  The pleasure seeker, seeks pleasure because they feel none in the present moment. In the seeking they suffer from their want.

       Behind the news     The priest mentioned in   this  urlLink CNN story    is a former classmate of mine. What they don't mention is that he is Carlos Santana's cousin:   The church is investigating whether Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, who died in 1963 after dedicating his life to the church, was responsible for curing a person of gangrene; another of diabetes, respiratory failure and heart failure; and a third of skin cancer, said priest Edward Santana, who is heading the investigations for the church.   The first two alleged miracles occurred in Rome's Plaza San Pedro immediately after Rodriguez's beatification a year ago Monday. The third, in Puerto Rico, allegedly occurred two months ago, said Santana, of the diocese in Caguas where Rodriguez was from.

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives . Here is the eleventh Step:    (11) To chastise the body (cf 1 Cor 9:27).   I work out in a gym about five times a week usually on my way home for work. There are a few regulars who are always there, both when I arrive and still there when I leave. They push their bodies to the absolute limit and their bodies show the results. Most people envy them but few are willing to put their bodies through the rigors required for such results.  I begin with this example for obvious reasons. When it comes to spirituality most people react negatively to the thought of monks beating themselves with flagelants or wearing hair shirts and I think rightly so, but as often happens when we reject a faulty interpretation, we seldom replace it with a correct one.  About a year ago I was giving a tour of a Benedictine Monastery, where I had attended college almost twenty years ago, to some visitors. Being a curious soul I know the place inside and out. Among the visitors was an author that I had worked with and her friend, along with another Benedictine Nun, all  who were attending a conference at a nearby convent.  In the course of our tour we came upon the Chapter room of the monastery. The walls and ceiling of the Chapter Room were illustrated beautifully by a Swiss monk who had lived at the monastery in the early mid-1900's. The ceiling contained the signs of the zodiac illustrating the whole of life, the walls illustrated some of the steps that St. Benedict mentions in his rule (the subject of this series).  He illustrated this step by showing several monks flogging themselves. I mentioned that this was from the rule and the Benedictine sister immediately said that it wasn't. I mildly protested but she insisted. Later when we arrived at the bookstore, I openned the Rule of St. Benedict to the page and pointed out to her where it was. She was undetered, "It's a poor translation."  She mentioned another translation, but here again the wording was the same. Finally, she said,"well who believes that anymore?"  "Bodybuilders," I answered.  Chastising our flesh is a way of mastering our bodies and our wills.   One of my favorite soon to be saints, Father Solanus Casey, jogged. I think I read somewhere that he did so to punish his flesh. Chastising the body can be a healthy enterprise.  A famous Franciscan friar, who is a little overweight and has had numerous heart problems, told me recently that he was finally taking care of his body since he saw hopeful signs in the church.  A recent country song perhaps gives us this point best in modern language, "She treats her body like a temple, I treat mine like a honky tonk." If we believe that our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, then we will maintain it in a way that show that we treasure it.

        Amy made the front page   of the local afternoon paper here in Fort Wayne on Friday. Neither of us knew anything about it until the Pastor of the parish we attend mentioned it in his announcements at the end of Mass today. You can  urlLink read about it here:  A test of faith   Nancy Nall wrote it, you can read more urlLink  from her here.

        A seminarian,   from a large midwestern seminary, responded to my query about the following items:   I noticed that you attend a seminary mentioned by Michael Rose in his book  urlLink Goodbye, Good Men.   Have you read or seen a copy of the book? Your seminary is one mentioned in the book and it claims  that the formation team there is incredibly gay. Is that your experience?  I'd love to hear your comments on what your experiences are in there presently.  Are there a large number of homosexual seminarians?  How are you being formed to live celibately?   Do seminarians go out on weekends? Date?   Are most of the  guys orthodox?    Here is his gracious answer:   First of all, let me say that I can't (and don't) speak for the seminary.  I'm sending this to you to give you a quick impression that  differs markedly from the one you might have based on Goodbye, Good Men.  I invite you and Michael Rose to come to visit if you want to investigate how things are here.  I suspect that Michael Rose would be somewhat surprised by what he would find.  You asked if I had read the book.  I have ordered it, but have yet to receive it.  However, I borrowed a copy tonight in order to at least  read the chapter that speaks horrors referring to this seminary. I can't call the seminarian quoted in that section a liar because I don't know him, but I have been here for two years now, and I don't recognize the seminary of my experience in his descriptions.  There has been a tremendous turnover in formation faculty, so I can't speak of faculty members from the past.  But today I would never describe the current formation faculty as "gay."  Nor has that been the way men who have been here for five years speak.  (They do say things are getting better and better on the formation front, but that seems mostly a matter of their active investment in their role as formators of seminarians, not their "orthodoxy" or "straightness".)  I suspect that a few of the faculty members may be homosexual, but I have no suspicions that they are acting out or encouraging others to do so.  There is no tolerance for sexual acting out here, whether heterosexual or homosexual.  The moral teachings of the Church are taught, and the expectations for students and faculty are that we will all live celibate, chaste lives.  I have heard no rumors at all concerning  faculty acting out sexually with anyone, and no reports of faculty harassing students in any way.  As for the students, there are some who are effeminate, some I suspect may be homosexual, and some I hear are homosexual.  But the sum of these impressions and reports does not add up to a large percentage.  Those who are effeminate or who are assumed to be homosexual are not harassed, nor are heterosexuals harassed by them.  To use common parlance, this seems neither a "homophobic" nor a "gay-friendly" place.  No one speaks about changing Church teaching about homosexuality, even if there is an  acknowledgment by faculty and students that there are homosexuals as well as heterosexuals in formation here.  In sum, I believe that the vast majority of men here are committed to living chaste, celibate lives.  There is no doubt that the current scandal in the Church has increased the explicitness with which we are attending to matters of sexual integration, human formation, and talking about pastoral responses to homosexuality.  I count all of this as a benefit of the current situation.  The program of formation includes attention to matters of sexual integration, human formation, and other relevant topics, like the   ongoing challenge of celibacy.  Teaching about celibacy is comprehensive, and focuses us on learning what it takes to live out our  "committed love" to Christ and the Church.  It is not simply about ways to ensure continence and self-denial, but a holistic way for priests and religious to express their committed love.  You asked about "dating," and I simply don't hear about seminarians doing so.  That is not to say that men don't do things socially with one other and with male and female acquaintances in the area, but "dating" is not an accurate description.  It's what you might expect: friends doing things together, just as you would find in any social context.  I can't think of any seminarians who openly challenge Church teachings about faith and morals.  And, to my mind, that makes them quite orthodox.  Differences among seminarians are most conspicuous at the level of personal piety.  The differences do not revolve around  fidelity to the Magisterium.  I have never heard any faculty members say or teach anything that challenged or contradicted the Church's moral teaching.  In fact, the academic faculty is exceptional.  They provide both intellectual and spiritual nourishment in their classes.  They are men and women (mostly priests and religious) of faith who know their subjects well and have great pedagogical skills.  They teach from the standpoint of faith, with an eye to helping us become priests after the heart of Jesus Christ.  In sum, I am very glad that I am in formation here.  It would be hard to imagine a better academic faculty at a Catholic seminary.  And I see continued improvements in the attention that will be given here (and I suspect at every American seminary) to issues of human formation, celibacy, and sexual integration, among the other areas spelled out in  Pastores Dabo Vobis .  I am glad that the heat is being turned up on the entire Church, and that increased attention (in part because of Rose's book) will be paid to American Seminaries.  I count that as a potential benefit of the tragedy.  If a seminary were in fact the sort of place Rose describes in his book, radical changes would be in order.  And there may well be such places, and they need to be  reformed.  But this seminary is no longer among them, in my estimation.   If there have been major changes, that makes me think that this Archbishop and this Rector "get it."  May God be pleased that the situation will be similar across all the dioceses and seminaries in our land!  p.s. I am admittedly a bit troubled by the salacious tone of Rose's book.  After thumbing through it, I wondered if the book isn't a bit too sensationalist for its own good.  The men who are informants seem, to a man, to have axes to grind.  p.p.s. FWIW, I think there are some men who are too rigid in their embrace of ORTHODOXY to have any sense of mercy in their role as priests.  I know some men back home who are immature in their orthodoxy.  They are unable to tolerate sinners (and differences of  opinion), and therefore would be ineffective in the work of evangelism and ministry.  All of that to say that "kicking someone out" for being "too orthodox" may not always be as bad as Rose seems to think.  Those who have been here (especially those who have been here longer than I) and are aware of this book are angry about its contents.  They feel (justifiably, I think) rather defensive.  However, I trust that even this off-balance book will help us all in the long-run, even if I am troubled by his method, tone, and assumptions.

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives.  Here is the tenth Step:     (10) To deny one's self in order to follow Christ (cf Mt 16:24; Lk 9:23).   Denial has come to mean, not facing reality. This is not the type of "denial" that St. Benedict is promoting. Rather it is just the opposite, it is to deny the falsehood of the self that always feels threatened. This false "self" does not exist but is the result of Original Sin and we all struggle with it throughout our lives.  There is a part of us that feels that we must always be vigilant unless someone get one up on us. It is the part of our personality that puts up walls, that is afraid to be our true selves. Simply it is that part of us that fears being embarrassed, thought ill of or that we secretly fear is the definition of who we really are and we work tirelessly to keep everyone from learning the truth.  Of course, the truth is that this is not who we really are at all.  We are just the opposite of the Son of God. Jesus was God but as St. Paul says in Philippians, "did not deem equality with God." Jesus ate and drank with sinners, he associated with some very ungodly people.   None of us has to battle such odds. We are not God, but as the fruit of original sin we have all inherited the notion that we are supposed to be God. So most of us spend our lives not exercising the talents and gifts that God has blessed us with because we fear that we will fail to use them perfectly.  I wonder how many there are who have been graced with the gift of healing the sick but who never reach out to the sick because they fear the embarrassment that might come their way? Or how many talented leaders stand idly by while those not gifted lead?  Denying oneself means letting go of the fears that we do not possess abilities of god proportions and stepping out in faith knowing that God will provide what is lacking to our talents as we exercise them for the good of humanity.  Perhaps the most commonly told parable by Jesus about the Kingdom of God is that of the King or landowner who passes out talents before taking a trip. Those who invest in their talents are praised upon the Master's return whereas the one who buries his talents is condemned.  Why did the servant bury his talents? Because he was afraid.  Why does Jesus tell the parable? So his followers will not fall into the same predicament. Yet how many Christians will hear the words, deny yourself and immediately interpret the Lord's words as though he were advocating burying one's talents? Unbelievable!  Deny the fear of making a mistake, taking a risk of what might happen if you follow Our Lord to Jerusalem. The disciples told Jesus that if they went to Jerusalem he certainly would be killed, did he not fear for his life? Thomas often cast as the doubter but in fact probably the supreme believer says, "let us go to die with him!"  When we let go of the fear of what others think about us when it comes to using the talents and abilities that God has given us then we will truly build the Kingdom of God. Denying that part of ourselves that would bury our talents our of fear is true humility.

        Nothing new here  , but a rehash (and slap on the hand by Cardinal Ratzinger) on  urlLink ABC's 20/20 last night--Sexual Abuse Allegations Covered-Up by Vatican:      The alleged victims say the Vatican knew of the allegations against Father Marcial Maciel and chose not to pursue them.  In fact, the pope has continued to praise 82-year-old Maciel, a Mexico native, as an effective leader of Catholic youth, despite detailed allegations sent to the Vatican four years ago saying the man was also a long-time pedophile.   Maciel denies the charges and said the men made them up only after leaving the Legion of Christ.   Maciel is the founder of the little-known but well-connected and well-financed Legion of Christ which has raised millions of dollars for the Church. Operating in the United States and 19 other countries, the Legion of Christ recruits boys as young as 10 years old to leave their families and follow a rigorous course of study to become priests.    And:   Vaca is not alone. He is one of eight former students, now all in their 60s, who have signed sworn affidavits submitted to the Vatican that they were abused by Maciel.   When they were members of the Legion, the accusers were devout followers of Marciel. But for the last eight years, they have been trying to get the Vatican to listen or even acknowledge their detailed allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of Father Maciel. They say they have not heard a response from the Vatican.     If nothing else, I think this case shows a reluctance on the part of the Vatican (which other bishops are merely following) to pursue these type of cases. If true, who knows how many victims there could be who are still in the order.

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives . Here is the ninth Step:    (9) And what one would not have done to himself, not to do to another (cf Tob 4:16; Mt 7:12; Lk 6:31).   The Golden Rule is well known across cultures. At an early age we are taught to treat others in the same way that we wish to be treated. Has this rule fallen on deaf ears though in our time?  Could it be that we no longer think about others or care about them? What is it that has desensitized us from the needs of others?  Forty years ago people marched upon the towns and villages of the south to protest the way people of color were still being treated; almost a century since the cessation of slavery. Something of the Golden Rule motivated those marches and when television cameras broadcast those images to the rest of the nation soon others changed their opinions too.  But forty years later it seems that the multiplicity of those images along with the dramatization of similar images has lessened the impact of reality. Like a collective hypnosis we seem not to be affected by the plight of our fellow human anymore. Like a callous that develops from constant friction, the flood of images of suffering and hurting individuals has dampened our ability to care.  I suppose that recognizing this, is the first step to diagnosing it as a problem that is destroying us as a society. St. Benedict’s maxim can serve as a corrective. The first step is to really feel, what it is that I feel.  How do I feel when someone smiles at me? It feels good, I feel important or at least that this person is well disposed toward me which is also a good feeling. If this is so I should offer a smile to those who life cast in my path today.  How do I feel when someone treats me in a manner that makes me feel that my existence is inconsequential to them? Probably not very good, then I need to even in a small way acknowledge everyone as an important part of God’s plan for me today.  We tend to be a society in touch with their feelings. It is a small step to return back to a more civil manner of existence where I believe that there is not just “me” but us on this planet. Everyone is important in God’s plan. My feelings are the key to defining how I should treat others in the way that God wants me to do.

        A reader writes concerning so called Catholic Hospitals:     St. Francis Hospital in Trenton, NJ is giving the "Spirit of St. Francis" award to the state Democratic Chair, abortion extremist,  planed parenthood funded and supported, Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman....2 times she voted against Parental Notification.  She is the chairperson for appropriations money.  St. Francis "sold the farm and the mission."    They no longer have a maternity wing.  Actually a 'blog" could help us with a phone campaign.   The Bishop is silent (now there's a surprise) . He has not responded to any letters.    Irony....the gala affair where the award will be given is  Mother's day weekend     One wonders why the bishops don't step in and strip both hospitals and universities of the "Catholic" title? I know of a bishop who himself is under fire in Florida who has threatened small Catholic bookstores in this regard, but wouldn' t dare to do the same to a hospital or university.

         urlLink Emily Stimpson  has quoted   the same reader as I have (he must have emailed all of the Catholic blogs he could find) and has written a number of entries that follow along the same theme. While I admire the motivation behind her point--that the Church is the Body of Christ, I think she is missing the point... in the same way that she feels my wife  urlLink Amy   is missing the point.  The notion of the Church as the Body of Christ originates with Saint Paul. The same Saint Paul said:   You have become news with a case of immorality, and such a case that is not even found among the pagans ...(referring to the man who had taken his stepmother as a wife)...    And you feel proud! Should you not be in mourning instead and expel the sinner. For my part, although I am physically absent, my spirit is with you, as if present. I have already passed sentence on the man who committed such a sin. Let us meet together, you and my spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus and with his power, you shall deliver him to Satan, so that he loses everything and his life, but his spirit be saved on the day of Judgment.  (1 Cor. 5:1,2-5)  Elsewhere, Our Lord also using the image of the body said:   If your hand makes you fall into sin, cut it off! It is better to enter life without a hand than with two hands to go to hell, to the fire that never goes out. And if your foot makes you fall into sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter life without a foot than with both feet  to be thrown into hell.  And if your eye makes you fall into sin tear it out! It is better to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than, keeping both eyes to be thrown into hell where the worms that eat them never die, and fire never goes out.  (Mark 9:43-48)  This passage follows the one most quoted during the current crisis:   If anyone should cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble and sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a great millstone around his neck.  (Mark 9:42)   What bothers most people about this issue is that this  surgery  on the Body of Christ has yet to be done.    Granted patience is necessary, but there comes a point where some still are way too "proud," even though they have sanctioned and facilitated certian members of the clergy in their commission of the most unspeakable acts. God speaks to us in the Holy Scriptures about what is necessary.  Good people are people of prayer. They do not need to be called to prayer and repentance--they already are praying. I attend Mass daily, recite the rosary daily, pray the liturgy of the hours daily and do spiritual reading daily.   The people who need to "repent" are the people who are heading in the wrong direction. Some of these are not interested in turning back to Christ who is the Truth, but rather they are interested in protecting their "place" as I have written about in other places on this blog, which of course is a reference to the High Priest in John's Gospel:   What are we to do? For this man keeps on giving miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, all the people will believe in him and, as a result of this, the Romans will come and sweep away our Holy Place and our nation.  (John 11:47,48)  The man is Jesus Christ--the TRUTH, and you can replace the "Roman" with the "press or media." A day of prayer of healing for all those who have suffered at the hands of evil men is a good idea, after the evil men have been excised from the Body of Christ--let them retire to a monastery, let them join the faithful in prayer but not as leaders but as penitents.

        From a writer to this blog:     I'd like to make a suggestion, though I have no forum for doing so: We should have a national collection to pay monetary restitution for the claims that have and will arise from the current scandal.  For if we don't, how many fine institutions will be hurt?  The money has to come from somewhere - do we want to see schools close, programs be cut back, already-strained retirement funds tapped?   I would also like to make a suggestion, something that could set the mood for a national day of penance:  Sell all the Catholic Hospitals in the United States. They are no longer "Catholic," they no longer serve the poor, and they perform medical procedures that are at odds with  the teaching of the Church. Remove the name of whatever saint is associated with the hospital and let them continue to exist as private hospitals for the wealthy. The religious orders who run them now, can be freed from the responsibility and use the money to take care of their elderly sisters or brothers.  Sell all Cardinal's residences. Let the Cardinals live in public housing if they do not want to live in a rectory like other priests. All the proceeds from the sale of these mansions should go to victims of abuse. Along with the sale of these mansions, should be the selling of anything of wealth that the Cardinals have personally acquired over the years. We need leaders who resemble Christ not Queen Elizabeth.  All Archbishops and Bishops should hold a convocation in their dioceses of victims where victims are allowed to voice their concerns publicly to the bishops who will adopt a  penitential stance toward this. I'm not advocating a public stoning, but I am advocating a public humiliation of the bishops hearing a list of the abuse that people have suffered because they have not acted in their role as shepherds who should protect their charges from wolves, rather than moving the wolves around to prey on more sheep.   What about the rest of us? Should we finance abuse settlements?   No!  Let the riches of the Church be sold, they are a scandal in and of themselves. Let bishop's divest themselves of mitres and vestments that separate that are holdovers from the days when princes occupied episcopal sees...let us return to the Church where the Church imitates it's founder and the simple Galilean fishermen who were the first bishops!

        Thanks to    urlLink E.L. Core of The View from the Core  for this link to  urlLink CNS  which gives the details of the 1961 directive alluded to  urlLink below :   Archbishop Bertone said that while the homosexual inclination is not sinful in itself, it "evokes moral concern" because it is a strong temptation to actions that "are always in themselves evil."  He defined the homosexual inclination as "a temptation that, for whatever reason, has become so predominant in a person's life as to become a force shaping the entire outlook of the person."  "Persons with a homosexual inclination should not be admitted to the seminary," Archbishop Bertone said.  In 1961, a Vatican document on the selection of candidates to the priesthood said much the same thing. The instruction was issued by the then-Sacred Congregation for Religious and concerned those entering religious orders.  "Those affected by the perverse inclination to homosexuality or pederasty should be excluded from religious vows and ordination," it said. It said the community life and priestly ministry would constitute a "grave danger" or temptation for these people.  The document recommended that any person with serious unresolved sexual problems be screened out, saying that the chastity and celibacy required by religious and priestly life would constitute for them a "continuous heroic act and a painful martyrdom."  The 1961 document has never been abrogated, so is still technically valid, officials said. But now, the Vatican is considering a reformulation of these principles, so that the message gets through more clearly to local churches.

        If you read between the lines  , and read what I was  urlLink told below , I think you'll see that action is being taken on the seminary front already. Now whether the real problem is being addressed or exactly how it is going to be addressed is another issue entirely. From the  urlLink Detroit Free Press:    The cardinals return to the United States with plans for Catholic leaders to immediately begin visiting seminaries to assess the suitability of priests-in-training.   The cardinals' final communique from the summit called for Vatican representatives to conduct special reviews of U.S. seminaries immediately. They are to assess whether Catholic teachings and principles, such as celibacy, are strictly followed. And they will review the criteria for judging candidates for the priesthood.    The editor of  America,  Father Thomas Reese, comments on this:   Some church leaders and others appear to think that homosexuals cannot be celibate, he said, though others say most gay priests are celibate

From the  urlLink Tampa Tribune:  A new Swedish study announced Wednesday claims french fries, potato chips, bread, rice and other fried or baked high-carbohydrate foods may cause cancer.   The culprit may be acrylamide, ``a probable human carcinogen'' formed when potatoes are fried and breads are baked, according to Sweden's National Food Administration, which did the preliminary research.

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God.  The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives.   Here is the Seventh Step:    8- To honor all men (cf 1 Pt 2:17).   	Often honor is confused with adoring or worshiping someone. For example when the commandment to honor one’s parents is rejected, what is usually rejected is the concept that I have to worship my parents, but that is not what honor means.  	To honor someone is to respect them as an individual who is part of the whole. I honor you if I acknowledge the uniqueness that you bring to the human race. I honor you as a fellow human being,  giving you all of the rights and respect that every human deserves. Added to this, is a deep respect for your person, your individuality.  	Too often our problems with other people is rooted in our inability to see them and accept them  as different from ourselves. The other is more introverted or extroverted—we want them to be like us. The other is too right brained or left brained—we want them to be like us.  	Honoring an individual means first and foremost that we  accept them as  the unique individual that God has created them to be.  	One would think that monks in a monastery would have little individuality. But in reality the monks I have been privileged to know in my life have exhibited the greatest individuality of any people that I have known. They all dress alike, their lives follow a similar ritual everyday, but their personalities and who God has created them to be shines forth.  	The “true self” as Thomas Merton termed the individual who is not trying to live up to the expectations imposed outside of the self can only be freed up by a deep trust in God. We can nurture the "true self" in others by honoring them as unique individuals with a mission from God.

        Update     Since I posted the original message (see below)   I had lunch with a priest friend. I mentioned the letter to him and lo and behold he told me that a priest friend who was at the same meeting had called and told him about it also. He said that originally the priest was going to fax him a copy of the letter, but then got cold feet and read part of it over the phone to him. The part he read, and the part that my source (a Bishop) mentioned to me was that the seminary was to enforce a missive that originally had been sent out in 1960. None of the parties that have heard this know what missive from 1960 is being referred to, but it could be this document that  urlLink Rod Dreher refers to in his Monday column: .    Rome has explicitly discouraged the ordination of homosexuals since at least 1961. For the past decade, the Vatican has been ratcheting up the pressure against gay ordination — to little avail in most U.S. dioceses.    My priest friend seemed to think that the letter was sent just to the seminary that both sources say received it, but my source told me that he thought that it had been sent to every seminary in the US.  Again, the reason the letter (which supposedly was secret--but you see how well secrets are kept in clerical circles) was shared at the meeting was because the Rector evidently had no idea of how it was supposed to be practically enforced.

        From my sources:     A secret missive was sent to all seminary rectors in the United States last week, from the Vatican, ordering them to purge their schools of homosexual candidates for the priesthood.   My source told me that those in charge with carrying out this order have no clue how they are to carry out this command.   Do you throw out people who look like homosexuals (who may be heterosexuals who just are effeminate), do you throw out people that defend the rights of homosexuals (who may be heterosexuals who are interested in the rights of all people), or do you throw out someone caught in the act (most seminaries would do this already--so there really isn't a change if that's the case).  When I mentioned to my source (someone in a position of the Church's authority), that seminaries should throw out anyone who is not chaste/celibate whether they be homosexual or heterosexual, he did not agree with me. I have problems with this, and I think this points to (as well as Cardinal George's comments that sex between a priest and 17 year old girl is not all that bad) that celibacy is the problem because the bishops know that if they truly ordain men committed to a chaste celibate lifestyle that the numbers would quickly be reduced by at least fifty percent. But this is honest and true.  As to purging seminaries of homosexuals,   urlLink you may wish to read my missive on the problems that exist in seminaries with regard to the faculty knowing the truth about those they are charged with evaluating , you'll see I think that it is simplistic to think that this is an easy task.

        Things that haven't changed as a result of the Vatican gathering:    The bishops still think they know best how to handle these situations, which if you read between the lines is not a lot different from how they have been handling them in the past. So expect the same in the future.  Secrecy is still the order of the day, (more on this above), for all of the talk about treating people with dignity--there is still the belief that lay people can't "handle the truth."

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives.  Here is the Seventh Step:     7. Not to bear false witness (cf Mt 19:18; Mk 10:19; Lk 18:20).   Lying about what we witness in life, is one of those sins that always has the appearance of not being all that serious, until it continues to escalate like a snowball growing bigger and bigger; until we are no longer sure of what the truth is. It is not in our interest or anyone else’s to not tell the truth.  Jesus identified himself with the Truth. If we are in communion with Jesus then we too will be fountains of the truth. But the temptation to choose other than the truth is a large one and it almost always has as an underpinning the sense that to do so is in our best interest.  It is not.  Many times our inability to tell the truth reveals a deep spiritual void within. We bear false witness because somehow it will make us appear better, which at it’s heart means that we feel that there is something wrong with us to begin with. The temptation to bear false witness about another or an event I have witnessed is an invitation for me to ask, “What do I feel is wrong with myself?”  Why do I feel the need to speak about an event or a person in an untruthful way? The answer is more self-revelatory than illustrative of any real happening outside of myself?  My answer allows me to peer into the hole within my soul.   Oh God help me to see myself as a valuable part of your creation. Allow me to see that the life I experience is alive with your presence and that others will always benefit from it.  But what about the other reasons, like, I don’t want to hurt someone?  Does the truth ever hurt? The answer is a loud and thunderous, yes it can hurt terribly. But is that bad?  Pain is a fact of life and to try to avoid it only delays the pain. Confronting it and accepting it leads to resurrection. The cross is a daily visitor to everyone. The choice is often whether we love people enough to be honest with them not hurt them but to help them to face reality in life.  Perhaps there is nothing more definitive about salvation than the one word--reality. A person who experiences the saving grace of God lives in reality, the world as it is.  The unsaved person lives a lie, perhaps it is a world of their creation. It is their fiction. It is impossible for others to be invited into this world of theirs because it is a non-existent place that they themselves do not even exist in. There is nothing sadder then to  experience this firsthand, but it is the lot of those who refuse to accept the pain of daily life.  There is the obvious consequence of bearing false witness that I have purposely left to the end. Consequences are of little matter here, but for many they are the guiding force of their daily actions. St. Benedict did not counsel in his maxim—“consider the end when giving a witness.” He did not do so because he has already laid out for us what the end-(the consequence of every action is)—it is God.  God is the consequence for anyone who sets out on this path. My concern is for doing what God commands. True compassion results.    All of our excuses and reasons for not doing so—usually rationalized from a concern for consequences, are derived from a lack of respect for others (Benedict’s second maxim). We do not believe in our neighbor’s right to “handle” the truth. This is very sad.

        How to handle a "scandal."   I have personally witnessed two potential scandals and two different ways of dealing with it. One involved a seminary rector and a number of bishops were involved (they covered it up for as long as they could --several years and then all hell broke loose), the other involved a principal at a Jesuit school (more on this below) where the Jesuit President of the school gathered the entire student body with teachers and we all found out about the allegation at the same time (hell never broke out--the students who were not noteworthy for comportment handled it like men). Cover-up I have found only leads to a bigger scandal, truth extinguishes scandal.   There is a  urlLink news story  today of another incident being handled by the same school I once taught at and if you read the story you'll see the Jesuits are still doing it the same way (at least in the New Orleans province):   The announcement was met by stunned silence.

       Report from the Seminary  Today     Currently I am at seminary in the midwest. Since I am good friends with a Bishop who is on the Board of Trustees here, I have access to both the seminary and the seminarians that the press is not allowed. In fact, if I took out my wallet and flashed my PRESS pass, I am sure that I would be quickly ushered out the door. I may try that later today, when I'm actually leaving anyway, but now on to report my experiences yesterday.   I arrived at the seminary in the early afternoon. There were a number of television trucks parked near the entrance. One local news agency was setting up to do a live remote broadcast. When I came into the front entrance I was stopped, and asked why I had come. I responded to meet with one of the faculty members (an OSV author who I had an appointment with later in the day). She told me to have a seat. I asked if I might visit the chapel (to pray). She said someone would have to accompany me.  Now, I haven't  had the experience of "being accompanied" anywhere since I was a child and so I asked why this was the case. She explained that many of the priests and seminarians rooms were right outside the chapel and I would be invading their "privacy." This explanation went on for some time as I raised a number of questions. Finally, a seminarian arrived, who had been summoned somehow (perhaps a secret button, like a bank teller might have?). He was to be my accompanier. I declined his invitation and asked the receptionist if my friend (the bishop) was out of his meeting.   All of a sudden she started apologizing. She didn't know who I was, they had to be careful, they had some incidents (no explanation as to what these were), etc. She rang the bishop, he came down and for the rest of the day I had free reign of the place.  I was impressed. The main chapel had undergone the usual deconstruction but another chapel remained untarnished. In the untouched chapel, their were seminarians at prayer (a fair number), and preparations were being made for Eucharistic Adoration. There were students in cassocks, clerics and jeans. I'm guessing that each vesture represented an idealogy. It struck me later when attending Vespers (evening prayer) that they were evenly divided.  It was just before Vespers that I viewed the whole ensemble. They actually seemed to be the same mix of men you would have seen twenty years earlier. They came in all sizes and shapes, as well as ages. Most were young, though their faces bore more stress than one would expect--no doubt due to the approaching final exams and for some ordination.  No shocks, very quiet atmosphere, prayerful. No overtly effeminate men. I am impressed.  More later...

        This is a continuation  of the  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . The previous are posted below among the other posts and last week's archives.  Here is the Sixth Step:   6. Not to covet (cf Rom 13:9).   St. Benedict attaches a scripture passage to this maxim which in many ways points to where he has obtained the previous four. In Romans 13:9 the Apostle wrote, “The commandments, “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not steal,” “Do not covet,” and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: “Love your neighbor as yourself, (Romans 13:9, NIV).”  The simple rendering not to covet is intriguing. We probably are used to the formulation that we should not covet our neighbor’s goods or our neighbor’s wife, but here there is just the simple injunction not to covet. There is nothing more difficult in the culture that we live in than to rid ourselves of desire.  Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha (enlightened one), based an entire religion on ridding ourselves of what he discovered was the source of all ill. In his four noble truths he stated, that all life is suffering, the cause of suffering is desire, the way to rid the world of suffering is to extinguish desire, that experience is Nirvana.  I remember teaching basically the same truth to teen boys in high school, and receiving a predictable response—“if you rid yourself of desire you wouldn’t move—you would just lie on the couch.” They, mirroring the culture that we live in, saw desire or coveting as a good thing. It is the very fuel that propels one to have great goals and to achieve great success.  But is it?  Doesn’t our desire or coveting rather blind us to achieving our goals, creating a false sense of what is needed to make us happy? What if we were to live each day with a sense of purpose but instead of being concerned about our plan we primarily were focused on God’s will for us.  This may seem too idealistic and we might retort, “How can I know God’s will for me today?” The spiritual writer Jean-Pierre De Caussade in his great spiritual work  Abandonment to Divine Providence  gave a simple guide to answering the question.  The will of God can best be discerned by a simple acceptance of whatever the day brings and to a focus on that.   My spiritual director Benedictine Father Lambert Reilley once mirrored this thought when I complained about all the distractions that I was suffering from. “People keep showing up and interupting the work that I am trying to get done.”  “Why look at them as distractions?” Father Lambert asked me. “Instead see them as people that God is sending to you.” What Father Lambert (who now is Archabbot Lambert) was saying to me was mirrored in the Rule of Saint Benedict’s injunction that the monks were to welcome the stranger as though Christ himself were arriving at the monastery.  So this notion of coveting, covers not only material things and the relationships that others have, it also covers are very time and the way we view it. Time is the biggest culprit in the whole business of ridding ourselves of coveting. We want and desire to have _______________(fiill in the blank) right now rather than waiting until it comes our way.  If it is our health, we want to feel better now, so we take drugs that in the long run ruin our immune system. If we are trying to lose weight, we want it now so we may injure our health seeking a quick solution. If we want material items why wait, put it on credit. All in all, coveting is a rejection of the world that we live in as it is, and the message of the Gospel is just the opposite, the world is not changed by wishing it to be otherwise, but rather by confronting the world as it is and dealing with it.  Why would we not sit around on the couch, if we rid ourselves of desiring? Because we would realize that we have work to do and it needs to be done now! The very act of coveting if we conceptualize it is that of a dreamer, not someone who is immersed in reality.   The opposite of coveting is acceptance.

        Step # 5 of the 73     5.  Not to steal...   It may seem strange that stealing is so high on  St. Benedict’s list, but there is nothing more destructive in communal living than mistrust and there is nothing that can destroy trust like living with thievery. Once something no matter how insignificant is stolen everyone around becomes the potential thief.  There is a story  I have heard so many times and so many versions of that I am not even sure where it is originally from but it goes something like this: An abbot of a monastery had become very disenchanted with the way the monks in his monastery treated one another. He ventured off to seek out the advice of an holy monk who lived as a hermit deep in the woods.  After the holy monk had listened to the abbot’s concern, he raised his hand and asked the abbot to wait while he prayed about this situation. Several hours passed and finally the hermit reappeared in the cell and made his solemn announcement to the abbot. “When you go back to the monastery tonight gather all of the monks into chapter and then announce to them what I have to tell you.” He then revealed what he had learned in prayer to the abbot.  That night the abbot did as the holy man had instructed, when the last of the monks had taken their place in the room, the abbot arose and announced to the gathered assembly, “The holy hermit has announced to me and asked me to inform you that God has revealed to him that the messiah is in our midst.” Afterwards the monks treated each other with great respect, wondering and not knowing if the monk they were dealing with might be the messiah.  The way we treat others and their property is largely based on how much we respect and hold them in awe. If we had a deep sense of love, respect and awe of each and every person we would never take anything from them. But too often we lack this basic sense of dignity that others deserve from us.  We reason that someone is wealthy and they won’t miss this or that item so we take it as though our attitude about someone else is reality. We reason that we have paid a just fee and that entitles us to more than what we know it does. All of our reasons are aimed at justifying something that we know is wrong and the very act of trying to rationalize our behavior makes us less not in God’s eyes but in our view of ourselves.  It is useful to remember that the men nailed next to Jesus on the cross are often referred to as thieves.  The so-called good thief acknowledges that his sin has merited so horrible a death. There was something of the presence of Jesus that made him realize that. If we put ourselves into the presence of God we will come to the same conclusion that taking what does not belong to us is wrong.

        The story that won't die.    urlLink Riches Of The Kingdom: From The Tampa Tribune:    A Nikon camera, a Bose radio, Nordstrom designer shirts, shoes, watches, sportswear: Bill Urbanski says Bishop Robert Lynch showered him with personal gifts during their unusual 4 1/2-year relationship.  ``I looked at my wife once and said, `What am I wearing that the bishop didn't buy me?' '' Urbanski recalls today.   Lynch's lavish spending on the bishop's former spokesman and near-constant companion knew few limits, Urbanski says. As they drove from a parish north of Tampa one day, the bishop's wallet opened again.   ``I was like, `I really wish I had a CD player in my car,' '' Urbanski says. ``Boom! We were in Circuit City, and he said, `I've wanted to buy you something. Pick it out.' ''    I'm trying to think of Jesus leading his apostles through the Temple and rather than turning over the tables, buying them whatever they wanted. If nothing else, one wonders what the leaders of the Church really believe in? Are they of the world or against it?   Celibacy is supposed to point toward the Kingdom where they are neither given nor taken in marriage. That is the ideal, but how is it being lived out in fact?

        One of the outcomes of the   Vatican Sex Abuse summit may be the resignation of Cardinal Law, according to this piece in the  urlLink Orlando Sentinel  today that claims at least one American Cardinal holds this opinion going into the meeting:   The cardinal, who asked to remain anonymous, said Sunday that he had been "commissioned" by other senior prelates to take their case against Law directly to Pope John Paul II's inner circle. He said he, as well as others, would do so today during private meetings at the Vatican. Today's meetings come a day before two days of talks between America's cardinals and Vatican leaders on the abuse scandal.  "If the Holy See wants to send a strong signal of quality and standards of leadership," the cardinal told The Times, Law "will have to be replaced. This cannot be a phaseout." The cardinal said he did not want to undermine his efforts by publicly disclosing his name before speaking to the Vatican.  The bishop, also speaking on a confidential basis, told The Times, "Many bishops are of the mind that the healing process really can't begin until there's a change of leadership in Boston."

        Step 4 of "73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God"     4. Not to commit adultery...   Sex and worship are bedfellows. It is not without reason that those concerned about the spiritual life are the same people who seem to struggle the most with sins of the flesh. Both are fueled by passion and the goal of the spiritual life is to channel that energy in the right direction. Every thing has it's rightful place in life.  The first question that arises in regard to this injunction, is why would  St. Benedict feel a monk needed to hear this? The answer of course,  is that no one is beyond the realm of the temptation of any sin. In this case a monk who left the monastery to be with another was committing adultery.  But a wider application of this maxim is that at the heart of adultery is a search for something that no human being can offer us, that sense of deep satisfaction that we truly belong.  The desire that we all feel to be loved and to belong is something that we will live with our entire lives. The connection that we feel with another human being or community is capable of giving a foretaste to the communion that we seek, but incomplete at the same time. A person who confuses the incompleteness of this sought after communion, and believes that it could be gained by going off in search for it somewhere else, is deceived.  The effect of this sin is all too evident, if we but reflect on it. Jesus said that a person who “lusts in his heart after another” has already committed adultery. It has been said that given that definition, that we all have sinned in this regard. So how then is it possible to put this maxim into practice?  The truth that underlies this injunction is perhaps best illustrated by the story in John’s Gospel of the Woman at the well. Jesus who finds himself alone at the well asks the woman for a drink. The conversation that ensues ultimately comes down to a question of satisfying the thirsts that we experience in life.  The woman had been married five times and was living with a sixth man at the time she spoke with Jesus. He points this out to her and if fits into the context of the “I thirst” and Jesus’ claim to be the source of water that will satisfy that thirst. There is something about this encounter with Jesus at the well that leads the woman to go into her village and to evangelize leading many others to Christ. Examine her motive for setting out to bring others to Jesus, she says, “He told me everything I ever did.”    There is something in Jesus pointing out all the empty wells, that she has sought out in her life to satisfy her thirst, that leads her to accept that he is the living water that she truly seeks.    Adultery is wrong above all because it is based on a lie which is, “The reason I am not happy or fulfilled right now is because of my situation and if I was with X or Y that would change.”   We can get so caught up in the rush of excitement that new relationships promise that we can lose all objectivity when facing temptations in life. Unfortunately we may fall into the same trap and learn the lessons over and over that what we desire is not a human connection but something that every human relationship is but a foretaste.  We have no idea what happened to the Samaritan woman after her encounter with Jesus at the well. Did she marry number six? Were there more men that followed?   My hunch is that she married number six and found in him a mate who was a helper to her and that she no longer confused the lust for more as something that anyone who was a mere human could fulfill. We too, will experience a quench to that unquechable thirst when we turn to God with all our hearts.

        Story is that Geoff Bodine's fiance (of six years?)   died last week. His ex-wife died earlier this year in Florida. For those who don't know him, Geoff Bodine is a NASCAR driver who won the Daytona 500 in 1986. Over the past 10 years he has had incredibly bad luck(making one think of a curse), but he did survive a horrific crash at Daytona two years ago--so personally he has something going for him. He finished third in the Daytona 500 this year and is racing at Talladega this Sunday. The story about his fiance appears on one of the original blogs,  urlLink Jayski.com, a site dedicated to Winston Cup Racing rumors:    Sad News: during an interview on FX's tape delayed qualifying show from Talladega, Dr. Dick Derggren interviewed Geoffrey Bodine, driver of the #09 Miccosukee Indian Gaming Ford (qualified 23rd) who said (paraphrasing as best as I can) - "This is really a tough time for me Dick. I had a birthday yesterday, but I also had a tragedy in my life, my fiancée of 6 years died last week. So I'm.standing here with mixed emotions, such a good car, and a good run and a lot of opportunity here, but my heart's really hurting right now, but we will get through the weekend. Angela would want me to be here, so we're here. But, we're gonna miss her. Going to be hard to get through this, but we will."

        A piece on Cardinal Mahoney's    qualifications as a reformer for the upcoming Vatican summit is found today in  urlLink The AmericanProwler:    The cardinal also said that he wants a victim of sexual molestation to sit on the abuse panel. Stammer (and co-author of the article Beth Shuster) found a colleague of Mahony's -- Bishop William S. Skystad, vice president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops -- to praise Mahony's proposal as "far-reaching." "I'm very impressed," Skylstad said.  Perhaps Mahony can use Nancy Sloan as the representative on this impressive panel for sex abuse victims. Sloan was abused by a molesting priest that Mahony later reassigned to a parish in Stockton, California, where Mahony served as bishop in the early 1980s

        Peggy Noonan's  urlLink description   of the Pope  in this paragraph should win her an award:   The pope is an old man, gravely ill, exhausted by his ascesticism. He is unable to show feeling or emotion through the Parkinsonian mask that freezes his features. When I saw him walk into a room two years ago--bent, moving slowly, his left eye drooping and rimmed red--his face seemed that of a half-submerged whale looking silently at the world, a great mammal risen from the deep.    She is so..o..o..o right about this too:   The pope has no doubt been told, repeatedly, that this is a media-driven scandal. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick this week told the Washington Post, his parish paper, that journalists are having "a heyday." The cardinal no doubt believes this to be true, but it is not.   Has anyone who repeats this line, that this is a "media driven" crisis, (and I hear it constantly in the Catholic environment that I am in), ever taken note of who is reporting the stories (Catholic journalist of all ilks--conservative and liberal)? Or have they taken note of the fact that most of the story is not even being reported, (Bishops are doing their best to remove accused priests without anyone knowing it--especially the press)? I know of a priest who was removed for having abused a 12 year old girl a month ago, and no newspaper had reported it yet. I also know that the priest has been arrested, why not?  This is so true, when Amy and I visited Saint Joseph University in Philadelphia a few weeks ago, we saw the Cardinal's residence (from a distance), it was like viewing the White House, but only one man is the resident:   The pope should know that many of the cardinals he will speak to have grown detached from life as it is suffered through by ordinary people. The princes of the church live as princes of the world. They live in great mansions in the heart of great cities, dine with senators and editors, and have grown worldly not in the best sense, in real sophistication and knowledge, but in the worst. They are surrounded by staff who serve them, drive them, answer their call. They are used to being obeyed. We all suffer from some degree of arrogance. But I have never seen star treatment ennoble the object of that treatment.   If I had my druthers, the Pope wouldn't remove any of them. Rather he would declare them penitents, and impose the following penance:  Have them walk around in rags, live in a public housing project and suffer eviction at least a couple of times, make them walk everywhere they need to go (no more jetting around the country), no housekeepers or servants--in fact they should be employed as night janitors or some other task.  Actually this is no penance but rather a description of the Son of Man's life, "who had no place to lay his head."  Most of  the Catholic Cardinals are no different then the televangelists who appear with their heavily made-up, Dolly Parton wigged wives on television. Most of their apologies have not come anywhere close to a tearful Jimmy Swaggart's "I have sinned against you!" Rather, they read just another statement that is aloof and leaves most yawning like their other statements. There is no passion, not about any of this anyway.  A radical reform, instituted by the Pope  would address these issues and the Cardinals would be spending their days with the poor, like a Mother Teresa.  Then the politicians would really have something to  fear from the Catholic Church because you would have men renowned for holiness calling the rest of us to imitate them as they imitate Christ.

        The Third Step of the 73  :   3. Then, not to kill...    I still remember vividly an incident that happened when I was a child and my family was on vacation in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. On a particular day we had just arrived at the summit of the mountain where the “Old Man of the Mountains,” a natural rock formation is located (it is on the New Hampshire quarter). We were sitting on some rocks and nearby was a long haired bearded guy—a hippie.  There were plenty of hippies in New England in the 1960’s, so there was nothing novel about that, but the action of this one was very memorable. He kept brushing away flies that were surrounding him. The more they continued to land on him, the more he would gently urge them to find another place to alight. His gentle tone and the words he spoke to the pests made it clear that he did not want to harm them.  My mother bent down to say that she had figured out that he felt that it was wrong to kill even a fly. Later I would read about people of various Eastern religions that shared this belief, “that all life was sacred," which of course is what we believe too--but we usually make endless distinctions.  St. Benedict’s counsel is simple. He does not elaborate about who or what we are not to kill. He keeps it simple and allows us the simple injunction to simple “not kill.”  This counsel follows after the first two; love God and love your neighbor. Now we are told not to kill. God is the source of all life and the Scriptures make it clear from the first pages of Genesis that to take back the spirit of Life is the domain of God and that blood spilt cries out to heaven.  It is also clear that in the first pages of Genesis that our neighbor is not only the people that surround us but every being in creation. We should respect all of creation in the same manner.  The hippie who allowed the fly to live on that vacation day in New Hampshire does not remain in my memory as some nut but rather as a prototype of a holy man who understands this fundamental truth. If you and I want to grow in holiness then we must reverence the life force that God has placed in all of creation.  “Not to kill” also extends beyond physical murder. We are to be a life force in God’s creation. Building up rather than tearing down. Uplifting rather than destroying.  I remember a friend in school who was fond of bringing up in the midst of conversations that were less than charitable about others a simple question, “How is this building up the body of Christ?” It really ticked off everyone at the table but like the hippie with the fly it has remained in my memory whereas the topics of our table conversations have long passed on into obscurity.  There are many ways to kill without actually taking someone’s physical life. Unfortunately there are too many walking dead in our midst who have had their spirit killed by those who were not careful in their speech or their judgments.  Lifting up these poor souls, reversing the damage done is a way to positively live out this injunction. It is not simply a matter of what not to do but to have an attitude of doing the opposite. The person who puts God first will carry with them an imitation of God who “breathes life” into inanimate clay.   What will this day be like if in every instance I put God first, treat all those who inhabit my environment with the attitude that I want to be a life giving force, a person of affirmation? Without God this is impossible and that is why prayer is something that is a 24/7 activity. We need to constantly turn to God, at every moment, in every encounter; to be silent until God is brought into the moment and then to be life giving as God is.

        The Second Step of the 73:    2. Love one's neighbor as one's self (cf Mt 22:37-39; Mk 12:30-31; Lk 10:27).  It is ironic but the way we treat our neighbor in many ways reveals what we think about ourselves.  Whenever I run into a parent berating the child I always find myself equally feeling as sorry for the parent as the child.  Negative views of oneself often lead to a negative view of others. This maxim follows the first that we love God above all things. It is from that maxim that a true sense of ourselves flows.  If I believe that God has a mission for me, then it is only a short distance of thought to believe that he has a mission for everyone else on the planet.  Daily we encounter opportunities to love our neighbor as ourselves.   The other day a woman carrying a bag of groceries bumped into me rushing to her car. She apologized and I immediately had the uncharitable thought of what in the hell is your hurry? But then I started to list the reasons for why she might have been in a hurry in my mind. Perhaps she was late for an important appointment or there was someone in dire need of something that she had just purchased at the store. In other words I strove to think of why I might be in a hurry and to afford her the same privilege.  Love our neighbor as ourselves ultimately means wishing them success. Success in their mission in life means success for us all. In the same way that loving God is foundational to the Spiritual life, so too is the love of neighbor. They all are pieces that fit into the same puzzle.  What of the most despicable people on the earth, how can we love them? What about those who ________ and __________(fill in the blanks with your favorite unforgivable sins)?   The answer is simple, we love them in the same way as we would if they were are own child.   I remember when the serial murderer Theodore Bundy was being executed in the State of Florida that his mother was interviewed. She was asked the question, “Do you still love your son?”   She answered, “Yes, I don’t like what he has done, but I still love him.”  I think it is easy to understand why she would. No matter what anyone of us do in our lifetime there is a part of us that is deeply lovable. No matter how hateful we are or what terrible things we do for whatever God known reason, there is a part of us that God has created and that is good, call it the “true self.”  The true self might be likened to that part of us that is the plan of God for each of us. It is that true self that we love in our neighbors and ourselves, because it is most truly who we are.  I remember a man who had undergone a conversion experience telling me in front of his family that he had never been that bad of a guy even before his conversion.   His daughters disagreed, as they in unison cried out, “yes your were dad, you were horrible!”  He then went on to explain how before his conversion he had “acted” in a way that he thought he had to, to be accepted; since his conversion he was truly himself.  I can think of no finer testimony of what life immersed in God’s love is like. We no longer “act” but we are who we are. It’s as simple as that.   Loving others can be difficult but doing so teaches us a lot about ourselves and who we truly worship as God.

        From the  urlLink New York Times    today:   In Boston, church documents released in the cases of the Rev. John J. Geoghan and the Rev. Paul R. Shanley include only one indication that any of Cardinal Law's top aides had voiced objections to a known sexual abuser being allowed to continue as a parish priest.   That bishop was John M. D'Arcy, who wrote to Cardinal Law in 1984, just after Father Geoghan was assigned to a new parish. Bishop D'Arcy raised concerns that Father Geoghan might cause more scandal in light of his "history of homosexual involvement with young boys."  Bishop D'Arcy, who leads the Diocese of Fort Wayne/South Bend in Indiana, declined to discuss his time in Boston.   The documents portray other senior officials as compassionate and sometimes clubby toward priests and concerned about avoiding scandal and preserving secrecy.     Bishop D'Arcy is the bishop here.

        I lied.   I mentioned below, that I was sick of writing about the scandals, but  as I'm reading the script for the Padre Pio audio book that we are doing, I  come across the following information:   Archbishop Gagliardi made wider accusations, "Padre Pio is demon-possessed," he declared. "I declare to you that he has a devil and the friars of San Giovanni Rotundo are a band of theives. With my own eyes I saw Padre Pio perfume himself and put makeup on his face. All this I swear on my pectoral cross!" He went on to make the lurid charge that Padre Pio frequently slept in the friary's guest room with attractive young women. His Capuchin brethren, living in "unspeakable luxury," had been paying newsmen to write sensational accounts of non-existent miracles and conversions in order to generate revenue for the friary of Our Lady of Grace.   Here we have it all, accusing the media of making the whole thing up, the saint sleeping with women and Franciscan's living in luxury. Calls to mind urlLink , Fr. Greeley's recent column ...  But as Paul Harvey would say, now it's time for  the rest of the story ...  For what you don't know about Archbishop Galiardi, appointed Archbishop at the age of 37 in 1897,   yes--1897   is the following:   Gagliardi had been repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct. There were constant complaints that he protected and even showed preference preference for priests who were homosexual or pedophiles, and accepted gifts from unsavory clerics. Gagliardi was personally so unpopular in his archdiocese that a riot broke out during a visit in the town of Vieste. The archbishop, celebrating Mass, had been attacked by a mob of 600 men and women, who pelted him with stones and bricks, charged the altar, threw his missal at him, knocked him to the floor and began to punch and kick him, until several priests dragged him into an adjoining room and slammed the door, but  soon a mob overcame the constables, and tore off the archbishop's vestments. As the men chanted obscenities, several women bared knives to castrate him, before more police came to rescue him intact.   I guess the moral of the story is beware of who is making the accusations. The accused will be declared a Saint in May, but the accuser will soon be forgotten.

        An episode of COPS (the real thing not television)   is taking place right outside my window. Nine cruisers, (I didn't know there were that many in all of Huntington), have pulled over a single car, arrested the two occupants (a man and a woman both heavily tatooed), stripped the car of its contents and have a dog sniffing the ditches. Now they are doing the perunctory interviewing of the suspects. It's better on television where you can hear what's being said.

        I'm working on a Padre Pio   audio book that we are releasing in June in time for Padre Pio's canonization. I'm currently reading the text and this line struck me:   Demons appeared to him, he reported, in the form of friends, colleagues, his superiors, Pope Pius X, Jesus, Mary and his guardian angel. He could always discern the diabolic character of these visions through a certain feeling of disgust and by his insistence that the supernatural visitors declare, "Praise Jesus!" If they refused to praise Jesus, he was convinced that they were of the devil.   Next time someone fills you with a certain feeling of disgust, no matter who they are, ask them to "praise Jesus" and who knows maybe they'll vanish.

        I'm tired of talking about scandals   and skeptical that anything meaningful will be done institutionally. My concern is that the Church not lose the ability to bring people to Christ. That is why I think true reform is necessary. There are those who have made the Church anything but a house of God or meeting place of believers; they are eople who are enemies of true prayer and worship. As a result many of us are filled with anger, rather than peace; division is sown rather than God's healing power. What I desire are holy priests who point me toward God.  Here is the first posting of a series that I am entitling  73 Steps to Spiritual Communion with God . These steps are drawn from Saint Benedict's  Rule , the reflections are my own.  This is step one:   (1) In the first place to love the Lord God with the whole heart, the whole soul, the whole strength...   Benedict begins what will be a list of simple practices with one that is above all others, the practice of a complete love of God. A love that is one that desires only God, symbolized by the heart; a love that meditates only on God symbolized by the soul; and a love that focuses all of its energy on exhibiting this love of God symbolized by my strength.  If we are honest, this is exactly what we all fear the most, an unconditional surrender of all to God.  I remember when I taught high school theology at a Jesuit School the response that I would always receive from my students whenever I would present to them Saint Ignatius’ First Principle and Foundation which teaches that the purpose of our lives is to know, love and serve God and that everything else is secondary and is here to help us attain that purpose. Most of the Catholic students would become outraged, usually a few non-Catholic students in some cases nonbelievers would say it made perfect sense to them. The issue of acceptance of this foundational attitude in spirituality is one of trust. Do we trust that God wants what is best for us. In our fears is an agenda that thinks that God will only get in the way of our happiness. Unfortunately it takes a long time for most of us to realize that what we think we want changes almost hourly.  We need direction in our lives. Our lives need to be oriented in some direction. The question is where will we seek that guidance? The map pocket of my car is full of maps. The maps are only helpful to me if I know what my ultimate destination is and if I know where I am at the present moment. Recently while driving in a strange city with the map opened to that city, I knew where I wanted to go but had no idea where I was. Someone in the neighborhood I was in had torn down all of the street signs. I  continued to travel up the street until finally I was able to locate a street sign.  Our lives can be the same confused mess that I felt on that day driving aimlessly up and down a city street.  Who are we? Why are we here?  The Baltimore Catechism gave us a simple answer. We are here because God loves us. That is the starting point of the spiritual quest is to believe wholeheartedly that we are loved.  A subtle but key ingredient to the fear that we feel in surrendering to God is that we do not believe that we are loved but fear that we are hated.  I remember as a child whenever I would be on my way to confession on a Saturday afternoon secretly fearing that God would try to see to it that I was killed before I arrived there. Where this fear came from I do not know, but it was real and it was only much later that I finally realized that God was the redeemer not the enemy.  The attitude we have toward God is all-important if we are to love God with our whole being. We must believe that God loves us first and want what is best for us. It is hard to do anything but love God with our whole being if we believe that God loves us. In an older translation of the New American Bible the words of Jesus are applicable here, “Fear is useless, what is needed is trust.”  The words of the supplicant must be our words also, “I believe Lord, help my unbelief.”  It may seem obvious that the first step that anyone would make toward perfect communion with God is to place God at the very center, but how many times we look everywhere else for the way?  If we wish to have communion with God we must enter into God’s presence and offer our entire being to God.  Most of us have given the allegiance of part of our being to God but not the whole. I can say that intellectually I have always believed in God and placed my soul in varying degrees to the love of God, but my heart well that is another story. There have been countless times that what my heart has desired has been anything but God. I have thought that this or that would make me truly happy and I have gone down many paths ignoring God in the process.  If I believe that God has created me and knows me best and what is in my ultimate interest, I will seek God above all things. I still remember the first time I encountered the simple engraving over the entrance of the Monastery of Our Lady of Gethsemane in Kentucky. I stood there for some time looking at the simple words etched in stone that seemed bigger than life, “GOD ALONE.” There was something shocking about the simplicity of the statement, but at the same time a truth that touched me deeply.  In the end when our life is failing nothing else will matter. If we can acknowledge that at this point why not see the wisdom of putting God first in everything today? The message of Benedict’s first step is to put God first in all things and to do so lovingly.

The name of the book, that I made reference to below is:  urlLink Guiding Your Catholic Preschooler  by Kathy Pierce and Lori Rowland. It is an excellent book, filled with ideas of how to pass on your Catholic Faith to your preschool children.

        From  urlLink Spirit Daily  today  :   Other messages addressing the Church have also occurred in partially Church-approved places like Akita, Japan -- where the Virgin told a nun named Sister Agnes Sasagawa on October 13, 1973, that "the work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against other bishops. The priests who venerate me will be scorned and opposed by their confreres... churches and altars sacked;  the Church will be full of those who accept compromises ."    And:   At Fatima, the famous third secret included an image of "a Bishop dressed in white" (the seer said it was her impression this was the Holy Father) and "other bishops, priests, men, and women religious going up a steep mountain," at the top of which was a large cross. As he went up it, said the seer, the Holy Father, " half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow," passed through a big city half in ruins and the corpses of many bishops, priests, and religious.     While the Vatican has interpreted that as representing the many who died during persecutions in the 20th century (especially due to Communism), and the wound the Pope suffered in the vision as from the assassination attempt in 1981, there are those who have interpreted his current pain as part of the premonition. Just before Fatima, Pope Pius X apparently had his own precognition when he expressed fear that enemies of the Church were seizing professorships in the seminaries and colleges, turning them into what the pontiff feared would become "chairs of pestilence."

       Seminary Experiences Part II     This is a  continuation of a post that I started a week ago.    After graduating from Saint Meinrad College, I was enrolled in a Major Seminary in the southern part of the United States. This seminary, unlike St. Meinrad, had the reputation of being "conservative." The criteria for this was essentially that there was a dress code and you were expected to be at every seminary function. My experiences at this school were mostly positive.  I was approached early on by one gay seminarian,  who also boasted that he had paid for the abortion of a woman who worked for his father in the diocesan pro life office. This man was kicked out eventually and died of AIDS a few years ago.  After that no one bothered me at the school and in contrast to the other seminary it seemed that there were no gay students. But of course later on, I found out that there actually had been a number of students who were, yet due to the nature of the place it was more hidden at this school.  A problem that did exist and it amazed me then and as I think back it amazes me even more today. Is the lack of faith that was often exhibited in the classrooms. I will tell a story, one that I wrote some years ago and originally was published in the New Oxford Review.  Here it is:   Tom showed up at the seminary wearing a T-shirt, a pair of jeans and the two sandals that were on his feet.  The first time I saw him, I remember asking him why he wasn't dressed in the seminary's required black pants and white shirt. His reply was that what he had on was all  he now owned. 	Tom was 33, and had worked for most of his life in construction. He had owned a decent plot of land, on which he had lived in a home that also was his. He lived a normal bachelor's life until one day he had an experience that changed his life.  The  Gospel became alive for him. Suddenly he understood the urgency of the call of Jesus in a way that he never had before. 	At that moment, unlike the rich young man in the gospel, he answered the invitation of Jesus and sold everything giving the money to his widowed mother, and to various brothers and sisters who he felt needed the money more than he. Now he was entering the seminary with only one pair of clothes, and his deep desire to follow Christ. 	From the start he was on a collision course; his strong belief in the gospel, a belief he had acted on challenged everyone who met him.  Seminaries attract all kinds of men, and Tom couldn't belief the lack of belief he encountered in  some of them. They would question him as to how he could give up everything for the gospel, didn't he know that these stories weren't to be taken that seriously? 	At first Tom  stood up to them when they belittled his faith. He  would challenge them, asking: "how can you give up a normal married life?"  They would answer with a flippant response, something to the effect that they doubted they would marry even if they were not ordained a priest. In other  words they didn't see the gospel message as something that required you to "give something up." 	As time went on, I noticed a change in Tom. He started doubting his own conversion experience. He wondered what had made him take the gospel so seriously. He started referring to himself as a fool. That is what the others were saying about him; they must be right. 	His responses to their attacks became less enthusiastic, in fact he started to doubt the whole thing. Confronted with the mixed motivations of the other seminarians that he encountered, he started wondering what had motivated him to come to his decision to leave everything and follow Christ. 	This happened at the same time that everything he believed in the Scriptures seemed to be called into question. Suddenly he was being told that the Red Sea was probably a swamp called the "reed sea", that most of the miracles in the Bible had a  natural explanation and could teach us something if we could get over trying to prove them as  acts that were supernatural. 	The last straw for Tom in all of this was reached one day in a Scripture class. The discussion that day focused on the miracle of  Jesus walking on the water. The professor speaking on the passage spoke of the symbolic  meaning of Jesus walking on the water was that he had overcome  death, (something of a miracle in and of itself, I would say). 	Tom raised his hand. "Yes, Tom," the professor said. 	"Do you mean that Jesus didn't really walk on water?" he asked. 	"Probably not," the professor replied.  	Tom got up and yelled, "run away," and walked out the door. Some laughed and others looked worried. The professor went on with class. 	I spoke with Tom after the class. "Its all a lie," he said. 	"Tom, he didn't say that it didn't happen, he said the necessary part of the story wasn't whether Jesus really walked on water or not, but that the passage  teaches us that Jesus was victorious over death," I said. 	"I've been a fool, to believe all this stuff," not really hearing what I had said, he replied looking off in the distance. 	From that day on, he sought to learn all that he could about these new interpretations of the Scriptures. He would sit at the entrance of the library and engage anyone who entered with conversation of his latest find. "Hey, it says here that the mystery religions were doing what Christianity supposedly discovered, centuries before." 	"Your finally getting it, Moses (Tom's nickname)," they would reply.   It was sad.  This modern day St. Francis was being swayed, not so much by the seminary, as the evil that lies within all of us that doesn't like to see someone answering the  call of Jesus better than we. 	The day came when he told me, what I already had suspected, he had decided that he was going to leave the seminary. The idea of being a priest no longer interested him; his faith now in shambles. 	"What are you going to do?" I asked. 	"I'll go back to construction work, I talked with my brother and he says he can get me a job." 	Before he left, there was one more ritual that he wanted to do. He planned it with great ceremony. On the day that he left the seminary he was going to go down to a pond that was located on the seminary property, take off his sandals and throw them out to the middle of the pond. "It will be a kind of shaking  off the dust of this place  and drowning it," he said. 	The day came for this ceremony and about five of Tom's friends gathered around him. He stood facing us, with his back to the pond, sandals on his feet.  "I came here because I believed," he started. "Now I don't," he reached down grabbed his sandals and flung them like Frisbees across the pond out into the center. He walked away from the pond barefoot. 	I missed Tom the next year at the seminary. He always offered a concrete challenge to speculations, that are often taught as fact. But his presence was felt even though he was long gone. 	I fished in the seminary pond almost every day, and as I would cast my line out into the water, my eyes would catch sight of something moving in the middle of the pond. There they were, Tom's sandals floating upright side by side. They were there for everyone to see. It was like some man, hidden from our view, wore them as he  walked on water.   The above story is true. I recall the first time I spotted the sandals I was with some friends fishing and we saw something moving in the water. It took awhile, before anyone figured out that they were the sandals that Tom had flung out their the year before.  I went back to teach at the seminary for a few years. While there I wrote an article that was published in The Priest magazine. When I reread it a few days ago (almost ten years after it was published) it confirmed my memories that what we read about now in the papers is something that has been known about and ignored for the most part for many years. Here is the article:    Few are Chosen     The condom lying on the shower grate disturbed the seminarian.  He was walking in to use the shower on a Monday morning and he noticed it lying there, in one of the public showers shared by the seminarians at the seminary. He wasn't sure what it signified. Had another seminarian had sex with someone in this shower or had someone used the condom in some act of autoerotism? Who had left it there and why? Was it left there as an act of defiance or was it a cry for help, to be delivered from a way of life the individual did not feel authentically called to? 	I could answer none of the seminarian's speculations, but could only face with him the difficulty of making sense of someone else's  struggle. Why would someone who obviously was struggling with the idea of celibacy not come forth openly and perhaps discern that God was calling him to give service to the Church in some other fashion? 	Pope John Paul II in speaking to the Bishops of the United States making their Ad Limina visit to Rome in 1993 said with regard to the formation of priests: "The failures of a small number of clerics make it all the more important that seminary formation discern scrupulously the charism of celibacy among candidates for the priesthood." 	I think anyone who has worked in formation work would readily agree that this is both necessary and needed.  Over the past two years I have worked in seminary formation. I am proud of what we have tried to accomplish here, yet would be the first to admit that this type of work is difficult.  There are real problems that one encounters in trying to facilitate discernment among those who feel called by God to serve the church as ordained celibate priests.  	The first problem one encounters is that many candidates feel that the process of discernment is finished on the day they are accepted by a diocese and enter a seminary.  Their view of discernment is entirely external. They reason, "If God wants me to be a priest, they (the institutional church) will accept me."  This method of discernment fails, in that it does not take into account the inner life of the seminarian. Does he fit into the institution? Can he live a celibate life?  	Candidates who approach their formation in this way live two lives. They act and speak in the way they feel they should when they are under the watchful eye of their vocation director or seminary formation team. In the modern situation this comes to include using the current glib phrases. 	I have sat in admissions interviews with candidates who when asked simple questions answer them like politicians. They speak of collaboration, the need to use inclusive language, and whatever else happens to be in vogue in seminary circles at the time. What is troublesome about this is that it is clearly said not out of any heartfelt commitment, but rather out of the same rote memorization that allowed a generation of Catholics trained in the Baltimore Catechism to give the right answers, regardless if they understood  what they meant. 	There is no area that one encounters this mechanical routine of someone rattling off the supposed required answers, then when the candidate is questioned about his ability to live a chaste celibate life. You would think that the candidates, regardless of their age, have never had an unchaste thought for their entire life. It gets to the point that when someone actually answers the questions honestly, they appear to be somewhat perverted. 	The seminary and consequently the church is presented with  inauthentic individuals, who sufficiently pass all of the required tests and are ordained after a period of preparation. The individuals who leave discernment of their vocation to the institutional church either continue to live a double life, or find that they have lost their true identity and give the appearance to the people they serve of being emotionally dead.  	The second problem is that the clerical environment is like a club or a fraternity to which prospective priests will do anything to join. They tend to form into subgroups that protect them and support them in whatever might exclude them if they were found out. So one finds subgroups within the seminary environment of practicing homosexuals and heterosexuals. If someone in the group is caught, the rest of the group quickly closes in and turns on the individual claiming that the person was acting out alone.  This leads to the formation of clerics that are not only leading a double life but also are quite accustomed to lying. 	These subgroups not only involve sexuality, but also form according to ideology. So there are groups who wish that the Church would revert back to Latin, and there are groups that will not be satisfied until every member of the body of Christ is ordained. 	Seminarians usually learn this behavior from members of the ordained clergy who they have befriended according to their personal situation. A student entering the seminary coming from a conservative background is warned by conservative priests not to let them know what you really think. The problem with this is that after a while the student no longer knows what he believes. Seminarians who are struggling with a homosexual lifestyle, have been warned by actively homosexual priests not to let anyone in the seminary system know of their orientation. 	One might wonder about the spiritual life of such seminarians. Their clerical relationships usually began under the guise of spiritual direction, and no doubt have been told by such priests that their inauthentic lifestyle is okay with God, regardless of what the Church teaches. The result of course is a very confused individual, who after ordination has to answer for a church that teaches doctrine that the individual himself has long since stopped believing in, if in fact he ever believed it at all. 	A third problem is that vocation directors and formation directors are concerned more with declining numbers than they are about the individuals who come to them for discernment. There are exceptions and they tend to be those who do vocation or formation work full time rather than as another job added to their already overloaded job description.     	Seminarian's know the situation for what it is, and when a seminarian  is dropped by a diocese that takes  discernment seriously, they immediately gravitate to a diocese known to accept anyone.  Bishop's fall into this trap when they believe that a candidate has been dropped either because they were too conservative or too liberal, which is almost never the case.    	I know of a situation where a  seminarian  was dropped by his diocese when  a woman came forward to the seminary claiming to have been sexually active with the man on weekends during his time at that institution. He left the seminary believing that an injustice had been done to him, never seeing the incompatibility of being sexually active and preparing to live a celibate life. 	The Bishop of this young man was shocked to meet him at a liturgical function in another diocese within six months after he had been dismissed from the seminary. He was now a seminarian for that diocese. The new sponsoring diocese had never contacted their new seminarian's previous seminary or his former diocese. They had no idea why he was dropped from the formation program other than what he chose to tell them, which was that the seminary had dropped him because he was too conservative. 	The screening of candidates for the ordained priesthood is very much at the discretion of the people that have been given that mission within a particular diocese. It would be wrong to blame the Holy Spirit on the haphazard fashion in which this is carried out. Some dioceses have groups made up of both clergy and lay people; others have one priest making all the decisions. 	Bishops who experience great problems in their diocese, with regard to the discipline of priestly celibacy, need to look no further than the vocation office and the seminary in which the priest was trained. Vocation directors need to be less concerned about numbers and  more concerned about the quality of the candidates they send to the seminary. Formation teams need to be more scrupulous in discerning whether someone has the charism of celibacy, and less forgiving when candidates clearly do not..	 	I have a friend who recently left the active priesthood. The seminary that he went to was aware that he was a marginal candidate because of a difficult  childhood. They sent him to  a psychologist who administered a variety of tests. At the conclusion of the tests the psychologist who happened to be Jewish, told the seminarian, "These tests make it appear that you are going to have a very difficult time living a celibate life." He advised my friend to leave the seminary. 	The reaction of the seminary that had sent him in the first place, was to question the motives of the psychologist in coming up with his evidently unwelcome comments to my friend. The rector of the seminary questioned the veracity of the results because the psychologist was a "non-Christian" and did not share our values.  The rector wanted to give my friend a chance, and my friend under the dream like state of desiring ordination took that chance. 	He went on to be ordained, because he believed those in charge of his formation were able to discern something that the tests of the psychologist could not measure. But the insight of the psychologist proved to be prophetic, my friend had problems with celibacy throughout his life as an ordained priest, until finally he left. He now is happily married. But had the screening process been allowed to function, much scandal could have been avoided. 	I have been struck at times how unwilling the church represented by those entrusted with this mission are reluctant to do what the Pope John Paul II is  calling for: the scrupulous screening and discerning of candidates who have the charism of celibacy  to do their job faithfully. Rather many seem bent on preparing candidates for a church that does not exist, however it is hard to blame them, for many of them were prepared for a church that itself no longer exists.  	I remember some years ago while I was a student myself at a seminary; there was grave concern over the rampant active homosexual activity going on at the campus. The concern came not from the clerical staff, but from the student body. A friend of mine went to one of the priest faculty members and told him of his concern. The priest's response was to tell my friend, "You and the bishops will have to get used to an actively homosexual priesthood." My friend, unwilling to accept that proposition left the seminary and married several years later. 	It is time  for those entrusted with formation of priestly candidates to take a strong stand in favor of celibacy, and stop wishing for something other than what the church is currently practicing. The seminary as it now exists will have to change its attitude toward those who come to discern a vocation from God. 	Some way must be found that will allow for individuals to discern the charism of celibacy in their lives in a non-clerical environment. A formation that allows the individual to be authentically who he is.  Many, if not most, will find that they do not have the charism to live a celibate life, when they are freed from the pressures of their friends to go ahead anyway awaiting a new church that does not exist in the present. 	This will mean a drastic drop in enrollment in seminaries. Fewer men will be ordained. Yet the situation will be more realistic. Those ordained will have truly discerned that they have been blessed with the charism to live a chaste celibate life, and will bless the church with their service. What would change, is that there would be no illusion of a large presbyterate made up of healthy celibates, something that does not exist now. 	I have no doubt that most of the people who come to a vocation director in any given diocese truly feel called by God to be a priest. "Many are called,  but few are chosen," Our Lord said. At this time the Roman Catholic Church has decided to choose only celibate males, the others who are called will have to wait, until the church decides to choose others.

        As I prepare to fill   my church envelope this morning, I cannot help but think that if Catholics across the country were to make a statement. let us say on Pentecost Sunday and to turn in an empty envelope with the message "remember" or "reform" or 'repent" or some other good "r" word, that those in charge would take notice immediately. Because I fear that what will happen otherwise is nothing. The institution and those that are well versed in it are always prepared to ride out the storm, thinking (or we might say knowing) that most people forget rather quickly. Most pundits seem to agree that this crisis will not go that route.  A very orthodox priest and member of Opus Dei, Father John McCloskey has said that this is a new "reformation."  The question is who will take charge of the reforming?  Cardinal Law has said that he will stay, but all reports say that he has gone into seclusion. If that is truly the case than the Archdiocese of Boston is in big trouble.  They are truly, sheep without a shepherd. The wolf has come and the shepherd is in seclusion (in some ways one might say that he has been for his entire time there).  The Cardinal's conservative stands are being attacked and he is nowhere defending his inconsistent behavior in being strong and determined when it comes to smashing dissent but weak and even an accomplice when it comes to covering up the actions of priests (liberal priests like Shanley even). So the voices raised in the Boston Archdiocese amount to "the Cardinal fired a nun for wearing a stole but allowed a priest who abused children to be moved around the diocese and around the country (with a glowing recomendation)," while former mayor Ray Flynn defends the Cardinal staying for the "good" of the church. Who is going to take charge of this reform?   Consevative Catholics need to speak out loudly about what matters--our faith in Christ!   When St. Francis dealt with evil priests he focused on Christ. He told his followers to reverence priests (even bad ones) because God would take care of them. For Francis this wasn't some futuristic escape from the problem, as accounts of his life prove. A priest, who we are told lived an impure lifestyle (it is left to our sordid imagination to fill in the details of what "impure"means here), contracted an illness that had him at the brink of death. He asked to be carried to Saint Francis that he might be blessed by him. This was done. St. Francis was reluctant to bless him because he warned him that once he was healed Francis feared that he would go back to his "vomit." Francis warned him, that if this was the case that God would punish him and he would suffer worst torments than he was suffering presently. The priest pleaded with Francis to be healed, Francis blessed him and the man got up freed from his disease but went back to impure lifestyle. A short while later, the roof of his house collapsed upon him in bed and he died a painful death. The followers of Francis remembered what Francis had told the priest.  If we are really believers, we will start praying like our prayers can and really do matter. We will be careful to speak out as followers of Christ, condemning sin but welcoming the repentant sinner. We will not contribute to the corruption in the Church by financing it, in fact we would be better off diverting our contributions to the poor.   I am quick to judge, it is my greatest sin. I need to be just as quick to turn to God who alone is the judge. I need to turn to God, not only to plead his forgiveness for my many sins and failings, but to pour out to him all that troubles me, because I know that God alone can save me and us!

        There is a interesting article   in the  urlLink San Francisco Chronicle  today that details three priests' take on the current scadal in the Catholic Church. One priest left to get married, another is still active in ministry and a third has because of a nervous breakdown.   The first priest, ordained in 1962, left in 1970 to marry.    "It was staggering," he said. "You left and no other priests called to see if you were dead or alive. The people in the parish were great. We got an apartment, and they would drop off notes, bring by food. But not the priests."    His comments on the current scandal are:   "It's a bigger scandal than it looks," Andre says. "These are priests, and if you can't trust these guys, the trust just goes. What has protected the church for so long is people think this stuff is unbelievable. Now it's not."   There has been lots of discussion recently about the culture of secrecy and loyalty in the Catholic priesthood. Andre has worked with cops and clergy, and says the code of loyalty is stronger among police than it is among priests.   "It's not just secrecy. They (priests) don't have that kind of loyalty to each other," he said. "It's more like distancing than covering up."    The second priest was ordained in 1975 and is a pastor: He says:   "My faith is not in the institution of the Catholic Church, but in Jesus Christ," he said. "I'm part of the institution, but if I were to rely on my faith in the institution, it would have been destroyed a long time ago."    And:   "It's not a new problem," Genovese said. "It's been so prominent in the media for so long. For (Boston's) Cardinal (Bernard) Law to not even follow the guidelines of the bishops conference -- that was disturbing."   Then there are the rising numbers of bishops, archbishops and cardinals around the world who are being forced to resign over their own sexual misconduct.   "The church has been so clear about other people's moral standards -- then to see it in the top ranks," the priest said. "It's the hypocrisy. If it hadn't been for the media, the church would have kept quiet. We are a flawed community, but they are concerned with the image of the church."    The third priest also ordained in 1975, suffered a nervous breakdown and has retired for medical reasons. He says:   "When I was in the church, I was so oblivious. I was in total denial about everything when it comes to sex," he says. "In retrospect, I see there was lots of sex among my fellow seminarians. I passed up a lot of opportunities and never even realized it."    HIs view on the church's view on celibacy is:   "The policy of mandatory celibacy in the Catholic Church is institutionalized sexual harassment," he says. "Somebody says, 'If you want this job, you have to have sex with me.' Somebody else says, 'If you want this job, you can't have sex.' If sexual harassment is about coercion, and not sex, then it's the same thing. These rules don't stop priests from having sex. It just stops them from being honest about it."

       Reader's Comments w/ my notes:    A lay faculty member   of a college seminary, comments on my seminary reflections:   When you wrote that some of the priests that you encountered were holy men and others seemed to believe in very little, I have to say that I encountered many more of the latter than the former. In 28 years of teaching at a seminary, outside of one priest faculty member, I can not recall a meaningful discussion of the faith with a priest there. I know that some of my lay colleagues approached priests there about personal spiritual matters and were pretty quickly dispatched to the shrink for help.  I don't know what your views of the lay faculty are, but very few of them were what I would call believing Catholics. In fact, several, as with many of the monks, were downright hostile to the Church. An English professor, for example, hated it outright. What amazes me in retrospect is that the mere suggestion to the powers-that-be that a seminary ought to have lay men and women faculty who were comfortable with their faith, would mark you as some type of rightwing fanatic. A majority of the lay faculty lived in the hope that the college would cease to be a seminary, so that it could become merely a liberal arts college.    A different perspective, but one that does not surprise me.    A Catholic priest  wrote in response to my post about lay people speaking out:   I find it wonderful when people offer me very constructive criticism.  It has been very helpful to me.  My heart goes out to the people who carry around the idea for days and then say, "But you are a priest, Father!  Who am I to say those things to you?"  We end up having very good talks as a result.  The people that sicken me are the ones who bring no complaint to me, write a letter to the bishop (who sends it directly to the pastor  without his own response), and don't even send me a CC.  That has happened only once albeit from a parishioner whose letters are shredded by many diocesan officials upon reception.  That in itself shows a problem.  There are so many chronic complainers out there (Thank you, Mother Angelica, for the call-in-and-accuse phone line) that pastors, VFs, and bishops are often very weary to answer legitimate complaints from good-hearted people.  I hope that everyone softens up so if there truly is a problem, it will be discussed.   He's right about chronic complainers and sneaky complainers. Go to the person you have a problem with first.   A  reader  writes in response to my comment about that Vatican II  "set in motion a reform which radically changed (one might say recovered) the role of the laity in the Church":    I think your use of the word "recovered" is neither accurate nor appropriate.  "Changed" is about as correct as you can get. The laity was "vibrant", which is a word no one would have used then.....but later we were taught a new and "relevant" vocabulary. With all it's local warts and pimples, Catholicism was a way of living.  Home, work, school.....it's what we lived and there was not much time for the deep introspection which is the vogue today.  The laity was embroiled in a world war. Money was scarce; children were not.  Everyone worked to get the grits on the table.  Faith was incorporated into our lives.  WWII had to be handled.  The poor (poorer than we were) had to be fed.  Starving children "overseas" were the responsibility of even the youngest of us.....Jesus said so.  Men performed manual labor for Church and neighbors....women cleaned and cooked and did fund raising for them. Everyone met at church and made novenas for all peoples injured by war.  NO laity are more dedicated and resoureful than Catholics, especially the poor ones.  It was always done for the love of God and God help the person who forgot that fact.  They were "taken down a peg or two".    So, one may say "recovered", but one might be ignorant of the real role of the laity during THOSE turbulant times.  P.S. I DO like your writing........you just hit a hot button.   I agree, if I can without going against what I originally said. Vatican II, because of the great strides the laity had made before it recaptured the "theology" of the role of the laity. Unfortunately, the implementation has almost squelched the flame that was burning so brightly before it.  A  light shining in the darkness  writes:   Okay, so I'm a college student, and Catholic Campus Ministries here does all the usual annoying things... a list follows.  1.  Standing through the Consecration.  At a "Catholicism 101" discussion group, our pastor, Rev. (not Fr. according to the bulletin) John Doe said that standing through the Consecration was the tradition of the Early Church, since we say "We thank you for counting us worthy to stand in your presence" in the Eucharistic Prayer... that sort of thing.   I inteject a line here, only to mention that Rev. John Doe is correct, which is not to say that his reasons for wanting to restore the practice may be less than pure and it might also be added that many things were done in the early church that no one seems to be arguing we return to (like doing baptisms in a separate room--because they involved nudity).   2.  Changing the words of the Mass.  Constantly.  You know the "Lord, you said to your apostles, 'Peace be with you'" part? He kind of throws in a second homily there.   3.  Then, all the peripheral issues.  Plenty of Pax Christi and Passionist pamphlets available (no Catholic Answers, of course), Richard McBrien's Catholicism on the main shelf in the CCM house (and no Catechism), a Chinese wall between CCM and the college chapter of Knights of Columbus, non-priest homilies, the occasional self-celebratory folk song ("Voices that Challenge")... shrug.  I could go on for a while, if you can't tell.  I'm sure I'm just a nit-picking Pharisee, stuck in the 16th century.  But, there's a chance  that I'm not, so anyway.  You said to speak out.  I assume this means more than complaining to my girlfriend and my parents over the phone (and to you over e-mail).  So, how should I go about it? Who can I contact for help?   The task here, as I see it anyway, is to figure out what are the real abuses (if any) and which are just preferences. The Roman Rite does allow for the priest to ad lib at some points in the liturgy (not to turn these ad libs into 10 minute homilies, mind you) and what material is allowed, if it is not contrary to the faith is a matter of opinion. I would recommend sitting down with a group of like minded students and forming a Catholic study group to learn what is allowed and what isn't. Invite Father John Doe to this group and question him, ask him for help in understanding what is detrimental and what is good. If this leaves you feeling that what you are receiving is heretical or illicit, go to the next level. Just don't let your faith in Christ suffer, suffering is something that Jesus has promised his followers and has told them that they are "blessed" when it happens to them for his sake.

        For those of you who miss the 1950's  , move  and join us here in Indiana:    City shuts down Coe concert    As country music singer David Allan Coe was set to take the stage  Friday evening for a concert at Cosmic Music Hall, a new venue on  Superior Street across from Foster Park, city officials stopped the  show due to building and fire code violations.  Harvey Hevenor, owner of the music hall, said Friday he has filed a  lawsuit against Kokomo because of the problems he's had with the city.  "Basically they're blackballing me," Hevenor said, after police  swarmed into the hall located at 400 W. Superior St., and told  everyone to leave.  "It would have been one of the best things in Kokomo," Hevenor said  of the music hall. "I had people from Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and  Illinois coming in for this."

        A major problem in the priesthood   in the United States has been the domination of homosexual priests in the ranks of vocation directors. When I taught in the seminary the Rector use to spend breakfast each morning detailing his dismay at the vocation directors and their obvious homosexual orientation (it must be added that the Rector himself was later accused and dismissed for having molested a number of young men). To be fair to bishops I think there is a reasonable reason for why this is a problem. If you think about it a bishop surveys the priests in his diocese and thinks, "who will do the best job in recruiting young men to the seminary?" He sees Father X who seems to be a magnet for young men, always seen in the company of young men and thinks "there is my man." The bishop presumes (I'm being charitable here, I think) that Father X is a chaste celibate. Father X who it turns out is not a chaste celibate but in fact an active homosexual recruits others who see in his lifestyle the perfect way to cloak their own. Thus, you end up with a presbyterate that is not based on faith in Christ but rather in providing a haven for a particular sexual orientation. This in turn leads to weak preaching, avoiding any mention of morality and as Dr. Leon Poddles has said the "femization of the Church."   Today, in the  urlLink St. Lousis Dispatch  there is yet another abuse story, this one involves a vocation director:   The Rev. Bryan Kuchar, who was one of the St. Louis Archdiocese's chief recruiters of young men to the priesthood, has been charged with six counts of sexually abusing a male minor in 1995.  Kuchar was arrested Wednesday night by police in St. Louis County and charged in a warrant issued today charging him with six counts of second-degree sodomy, a Class C felony. He is believed to be the only current priest in Missouri to be taken into police custody for abuse allegations since the nationwide abuse scandal began in January.  Kuchar, 36, is the associate director of the St. Louis Archdiocese's vocations office, headquartered at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. He lives at St. John the Baptist High School in the city's Bevo neighborhood.  Students at St. John the Baptist received letters announcing the priest's arrest and investigation on the allegations at the end of the school day on Thursday. That follows the archdiocese's six-week old policy of informing parishes and schools immediately about any credible allegations against a priest.    If I am right, and I think that I am, bishops in the future need to look for models of holiness to be vocation directors and avoid placing young priests in those positions.

        I will post seminary experiences Part II on Monday  . I have received quite a bit of feedback from others who attended the seminary that I wrote about on Monday and most have mentioned that they thought my assessment fair if a bit understated. My point in posting these experiences is not to dreg up past hurts but more an effort to show that the present scandals are nothing new...and merely the fruit of a wound that has been festering in the Church for sometime.  I think the Second Vatican Council sought to address how the Church would meet the needs of the modern world. It set in motion a reform which radically changed (one might say recovered) the role of the laity in the Church. In the ensuing years a battle has been fought as to how to implement the reforms of the council. Unfortunately this has sometimes led to the clericalization of the laity, which in turn has led the clerical culture to turn in on itself and to become even more secretive and protective of its fraternity.  Anyone who would raise a voice within that fraternity is often driven out usually in subbtle fashion and made to look as though they are an aggitator. I remember a priest friend telling me once that a seminarian, (a potential modern day St. Francis), who had sold everything that he owned and given it to the poor before coming to the seminary would never last--and he didn't. My priest friend's insight was that guy was too radical for the priesthood.  Since that time, some twenty years ago, good men have been ordained who go into the seminary with advice from holy priests to basically ignore what is taught in the seminary and to say all the right things in interviews. Trying to make the best of a bad situation, I'm not sure what the result of this bandaid approach will be in the long term.   There is need of a great reform, one that follows in the footsteps of St. Francis who heard from Our Lord on the cross, " Rebuild my church which is falling into ruin ." The Church that St. Francis knelt in on that day was literally in ruins, and chances our the church that you pray in is too (although the ruin that is probably present in your church has been destructed not by pagans but by "experts" who have done everything they could to remove not only the presence of Christ from your church but even his image and those of his saints). The nightly news proclaims the message...how will we react? Will we like Francis begin by picking up the stones and placing them on top of one another where we find ourselves? If so like him what we change where we are will eventually change the whole of Christ's Body.  What can "I" do you might ask?  First, pray. Make sure that your relationship with God is strong. The Church exists to facilitate our relationship with God and unfortunately weak preaching, bad catechetics have had an evil effect on the way we as Catholics live our faith. We need to reclaim our relationship with God and to make that primary in our lives. As the author of  Abandonment to Divine Providence wrote, " Without God, everything is nothing. With God, nothing is everything ." A strong relationship with God puts everything in perspective, " we put no trust in mortal princes ," we can face any difficulty and we can speak out boldly.  Secondly, If you are unsatisfied with the way your parish is run.  Speak out!  If on the other hand you are blessed to have a great priest, a good celebration of the liturgy, a Church that truly fosters your relationship with God, then  SPEAK OUT!  Whatever the truth be, let it be known.   Thirdly, do not treat anyone on earth as though they are not human. Your parents were human, they made mistakes--honor them! The pope, bishops, priests, deacons, sisters and nuns are all still human--don't expect them to be God. Their faults and our own constantly bring us to our knees--we need a savior and he is Jesus Christ!

        One of our diversions   on our recent trip home from NJ was to stop at the  urlLink Philadelphia Museum of Art  , granted for a very brief visit for such a large museum. With a baby who is fine as long as you are moving, stopping to meditate on any one piece was not the order of the day, but nevertheless we did manage to take in a glimpse of the various galleries.  The museum was featuring the art of  urlLink Barnett Newman . One of his seminal works is "The Stations of the Cross," this interested me and I immediately went to see it.  urlLink There is a sampling here  for your pleasure or puzzlement. Essentially this series of paintings focuses on white painted canvas, or sometimes-unpainted canvas with a vertical black line. I am very familiar with the stations, having written a "Biblical Way of the Cross" with my wife Amy some years ago, and also having prayed them all of my life (excluding the first seven years). I could not make heads or tails of what Newman was going for, was the dark line representing the cross or some internal feeling? I have no idea.  I had hoped to provide other links to some of the pieces that I particularly enjoyed, but  it seems that they have a very limited amount of their collection posted online.

        From a  urlLink talk    that Archbishop Chaput gave last week near Chicago:   In their efforts to be more open to the world since the Second Vatican Council, Catholics may have "been too comfortable and accommodating," Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver told a national meeting of the Institute on Religious Life.  "We've listened to the world too politely when it lies about abortion, or contraception, or divorce, or the death penalty, or our obligations to the poor, or the rights of undocumented workers, or the real meaning of pluralism, or our international responsibilities -- and  we haven't shouted out the truth ,"    I agree with everything that he says and could add a number of things that the bishops haven't shouted out that are true. I think that all of the current revelations that are going on are the reason why. When Bishops know that they are hiding truth and lying publicly they are rather ineffective in communicating other truths convincingly. Archbishop Chaput continues:   Calling on Catholics to "stop thinking of the church as some kind of religious corporation, and start treating the church as our mother and teacher," the archbishop said, "When we talk about the church as if she were just another impersonal bureaucracy, what we're really doing is creating an excuse to ignore her when she teaches."   This would be much easier if the institutional Church would stop hiding behind lawyers, and beauracracy. All of the great saints of the church have overcome this, why can't our bishops?   Those who teach and preach in the name of the church "need to do it fully, zealously and with all the persuasive skill God gives us," Archbishop Chaput said.  "All of us sooner or later get tempted to edit what the church teaches so we can please our audience," he added. "But if we refuse to teach the things we disagree with, or we teach them with a 'wink and a nod' to let others know that we don't really believe what the church says -- that's dishonest."   Amen! Why do bishops disagree with what the church teaches? Or is he pointing the finger at you and I?

        This in from the  urlLink Catholic New Service   :   Pope John Paul II will skip his customary vacation in the Italian mountains this summer because his traveling schedule is already full, Vatican sources said.  Normally the pope spends about 10 days in the northern Italian alps in mid-July. He used to spend much of his Italian vacation hiking, but in recent years he has taken drives instead.  This year, the pontiff, who turns 82 in May, plans to travel to Toronto for World Youth Day ceremonies, then to Guatemala and Mexico. The July 23-Aug. 1 trip is expected to begin with a rest and relaxation stop of three days at a yet-undisclosed location outside Toronto.  The pope also has been invited to his native Poland this summer, and Vatican sources said he was likely to travel there in mid-August. The trip probably would include a stop in the Tatra mountains, where the pope hiked as a young man.  The pope also plans to travel to Azerbaijan and Bulgaria in late May.   Several points to ponder:  1. How will he manage to do all of this?  2. Where will he rest in Canada? (I've also heard that he will visit New York and Ground Zero during this three day period, from my secret sources).  3. Why are they planning trips, when the Church is falling into ruin?

        It is good to know,   Cardinal Law is receiving counsel from other "good" Catholics like Senator Ted Kennedy. From the urlLink Boston Herald:    ``As to what I think about Cardinal Law's tenure and service, this must be private between the Cardinal and me,'' Kennedy said yesterday. ``I can say that these alleged charges are certainly the deepest wounds against the church in my lifetime. They do not, however, deter my faith but they bring unspeakable sorrow to it.''  A Kennedy aide said the senator had spoken with Law ``several times'' in recent weeks.   The fact that they are even "friends" is disturbing to me.

        Today, both readings   taken from the Church's Liturgy of the Hours for today's Office of Readings have selections that deal with clothing. First from the Book of Revelation:   “And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ’The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. “’I know your works; you have the name of being alive, and you are dead. Awake, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God. Remember then what you received and heard; keep that, and repent. If you will not awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you. Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. He who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments. I will not blot his name out of the book of life; I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’    There are two aspects about this reading that I find striking; the first is that " you have the name of being alive, and you are dead ", and the second, " Yet you still have a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments ."  What bothers me about the present crisis is something that I have already been through myself, a revelation of what the church is like from the inside. It has taken me years to recover from this and I fear that when others encounter the elements of the structures of the church that are corrupt they too will suffer a crisis of faith.  So this reading seems very relevant to the present crisis. Here we find Our Lord addressing the Church and telling this particular church that they are a "fraud".  They have the name of being alive (sharing in his resurrection) but they are dead, i.e. they do not act as though they believe in the resurrection for their actions bespeak more of an Epicurean philosophy of "eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die."   There have always been elements within the church that are dead. Some of them have died the slow death by being caught up in their position of authority (forgetting that it is from the Lord), others caught up in the adulation of the moment and wishing to remain there forget that the Lord's Palm Sunday is only a stop on the journey to Calvary. Whatever the reasons, it is a fact that good people can lose sight of God and it is also a fact that bad people have often found refuge in  the Church and benefited from the good will of believers. It is not for us to figure out who is the wheat or tares, which are the sheep and which the goats.  Our faith is what really matters. Are we alive? Priests and bishops are not god. St. Thomas long ago argued that their moral life did not affect the power of God to work in spite of them. Even when we suffer at the hands of  those who have evil intents, if we are alive in Christ we not fear that they have the power to destroy us. Remember Joseph's brothers who sold him into slavery…in the end Joseph was where God wanted him to be and the good work that he accomplished in Egypt was done in spite of the evil intent of his brothers.  The second part of the passage deals with garments. Since the second Vatican Council much has been made about the garments that priest and religious wear or choose not to wear. What interests here is how those garments are a sign that a person is in the Lord, and when bad things are done by those who wear the garments it is the name of the Lord that suffers. It is for this reason that those who find themselves incapable of speaking or living the truth that those garments proclaim should leave their ministry. They should exchange their soiled garments for penitential robes and retire to monasteries where they can pray for their own salvation that they may yet conquer, leaving the work of shepherding the flock to those who have "not soiled" their garments.  The second reading from the office today is from St. Cyprian to the people of Thibaris:   The blessed Apostle teaches us how to arm and prepare ourselves: "Put round you the belt of truth; put on the breastplate of righteousness; for shoes wear zeal for the Gospel of peace; take up the shield of faith to extinguish all the burning arrows of the evil one; take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God."  Let us take this armour and defend ourselves with these spiritual defences from heaven, so that when the evil day comes we may be able to resist the threats of the devil, and fight back against him.  Let us put on the breastplate of righteousness so that our breasts may be protected and kept safe from the arrows of the enemy. Let our feet be shod in the teaching of the Gospel, and armored so that when we begin to trample on the serpent and crush it, it will not be able to bite us or trip us up.  Let us with fortitude bear the shield of faith to protect us by extinguishing all the burning arrows that the enemy may launch against us.  Let us wear on our head the helmet of the spirit, to defend our ears against the proclamations of death, to defend our eyes against the sight of accursed idols, to defend our foreheads so that God’s sign may be kept intact, and to defend our mouths so that our tongues may proclaim victoriously the name of Christ their Lord.  And let us arm our right hand with the sword of the spirit so that it may courageously refuse the daily sacrifices, and, remembering the Eucharist, let the hand that took hold of the body of the Lord embrace the Lord himself, and so gain from the Lord the future prize of a heavenly crown.  Dear brethren, have all this firmly fixed in your hearts. If the day of persecution finds us thinking on these things and meditating upon them, the soldier of Christ, trained by Christ’s commands and instructions, will not tremble at the thought of battle, but will be ready to receive the crown of victory.   This second reading deals with how we should be clothed, with an armor of  Faith. We should pray like we are alive be willing to stand for the truth. This is not a time to attack the messengers of truth like our faith depends upon it. It is not a time to remain silent if we have something to speak.   There are those who have called this a time of  "purification" and so it is.  Cyprian's letter to the Thibaritans was an encouragement to them to meet the "persecution" by giving witness (martyrdom). Those who have tales to tell should now telling them so that the purification of the church might be complete.  There are those whose garments are clean, and there are those who have the armor of their faith in tact. Hopefully they will emerge from the ruins left behind when this crisis is over and take their place as leaders of the Church.  We can look forward to such a day; when again the true faith will be proclaimed, the forgiveness of sins will be preached, our hunger to receive the Lord in the Eucharist will be stirred and the TRUTH will set us free.  In the meantime, there are too many who remain silent to protect the clerical world which is crumbling before their eyes. They seek to protect their "place" like Caiphas wished to do when he said "it was better for one man to die than the entire nation perish." They have forgotten who God is and forgotten what the garment they wear signifies.  When the Pope makes a man a cardinal he clothes them in red, a sign of martyrdom. They are to witness the truth even to the point of shedding their blood for the truth. Unfortunately, sometime the red does not symbolize this willingness, in fact it becomes a sign of pride and vanity (the very antithesis of giving witness to Our Lord who was humility defined).  This reminds me of a recent song by Five for Fighting called "Superman (It's Not Easy)." Toward the end of the song there is the verse,  "I’m only a man in a silly red sheet."  Obviously, the line refers to Superman's cape, but it made me think of the Cardinal's who defy the truth and have turned the red cloth of martydom into a  "silly red sheet."

        Several people have written letters   saying that my post about Cardinal Arinze's remarks did not make sense to them. I am including a fuller treatment form  urlLink Zenit  here:   Cardinal Arinze Links Culture of Death and Sept. 11  VATICAN CITY, APRIL 9, 2002 (Zenit.org).- The Holy See sent a message to Buddhists proposing a joint commitment in defense of human life, threatened in myriad ways by the culture of death.   The message was sent by Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, on the occasion of the traditional celebration of Vesakh, the most important Buddhist feast. The feast is celebrated in countries of Therevada tradition on May 19, and in countries of Mahayana tradition on April 8.   The cardinal began his message by referring to the tragic events of Sept. 11. "Since then, people throughout the world have felt a new fear for the future," he said.   "In the midst of such fear, would it not be our duty, as Christians and Buddhists, together with all people of good will, to encourage hope and to build a culture based on this hope, in order to contribute to a more peaceful world in the future?" the cardinal asked.   "We are living in an era marked by great technological progress. This raises questions about the promotion of human values," the cardinal continued.   One "of the most important human values is doubtlessly the right to life, to be protected from the moment of conception up to the moment of natural death," he added.   "However, it must be considered a serious paradox that this right to life is threatened precisely by today´s highly advanced technology," the cardinal observed.   "Such a paradox has reached the extent of creating a culture of death, in which abortion, euthanasia and genetic experiments on human life itself have already obtained, or are on the way to obtaining, legal recognition," the Nigerian cardinal lamented.   "How can we not make a correlation between this culture of death, in which the most innocent, defenseless and critically ill human lives are threatened with death, and terrorist attacks, such as those of Sept. 11, in which thousands of innocent people were slaughtered?" the cardinal queried.   "We must say that both of these are built on contempt for human life," he affirmed.   Given the situation, Cardinal Arinze concluded by proposing the education of youth as a priority, "so that strong ethical convictions and a culture of life may prevail among them."

         urlLink Cardinal Arinze    is repeating a message that many believers have secretly believed about the horrible events of 9/11:   The Vatican said on Tuesday the September 11 attacks in the United States were the product of a society that engaged in abortion, euthanasia and genetic experiments on humans.  "The right to life is threatened precisely by today's highly advanced technology... creating a culture of death, in which abortion, euthanasia and genetic experiments on human life itself have already obtained or are on the way to obtaining legal recognition," Nigerian cardinal Francis Arinze said in a letter to Buddhists posted on the Vatican web site.  "How can we not make a correlation between this culture of death -- in which the most innocent, defenceless and critically ill human lives are threatened with death -- and terrorist attacks such as those of September 11, in which thousands of innocent people were slaughtered?"   This mirrors in many ways the basic message of our book on the events of 9/11 written by Father Benedict J. Groeschel entitled  urlLink The Cross at Ground Zero . I worked with Father Benedict on getting that book published here and have recently talked with him about doing a book on the current crisis in the Catholic Church in the US.  I also have worked with Cardinal Arinze, who many times is mentioned as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II, on a book of meditations on the Eucharist that we published entitled  urlLink The Holy Eucharist .

        Amy, Joseph and I visited   the  urlLink National Shrine of St. Rita Cascia in Philadephia  on Joseph's birthday, April 4th. I mentioned earlier that we were going to visit the Shrine but never actually wrote anything about the visit. On an unfortunate note, we arrived rather early around 9 a.m. so we weren't able to attend Mass (at noon) or visit the gift shop (opened at 11), but we were able to spend some time in prayer in the beautiful church.  Finding a parking space was a bit of a challenge. The shrine is located in an area of Philly where their are cars parked in the middle turn lanes up and down the street (I'm not sure if I have ever seen this anywhere before), so if you are visiting the St. Rita (the female patron of hopeless causes) then you had better pray for her intercession to find a parking space. We eventually found one in an alley behind the church.   The church has two levels, the upper main body of the church and the basement where a more modern rendering of the shrine is present (all though much of this was obscurred by current construction that seems to be going on). In the upper body of the church there is the actual shrine, a side altar dedicated to St. Rita that includes a reliquary of her body. In front of this altar between two kneeler is  a hopper filled with petitions folded up  and piled up in a way that anyone could come in and pick them up and read them. They made me think of "bets" that one might give to a bookie--I'm not sure why they struck me in this fashion (maybe it was an impression from the neighborhood or just the fashion of the petition receptacle or because we had just left Atlantic City).   The Blessed Sacrament was exposed and after praying before the Shrine of St. Rita and writing down a few petitions which cast into the hopper, we went to the center of the Church and knelt and prayed for a bit there.   Over the past months, I have become convinced that prayer is a constant enterprise something that we must do at every moment of the day. Equally necessary is focused prayer periods throughout the day. We must stay focused on God Alone! When we do so it is amazing how much more we value the people around us, how anxiety becomes a distant memory--when we don't the opposite is just as amazing (why we would ever choose to live in such a fashion!).  A short visit in the basement revealed plastic hanging around a beautiful bronze statue of St. Rita offering a thorn from her crown (or was she receiving it?) from a bronze image of Christ bound and crowned with thorns in front of her some twenty feet. The rest of the basement was shrouded in  urlLink plastic due to construction  that was in the process.  Overall a beautiful Shrine and place of prayer. Philadelphia residents are lucky to have three such shrines in their city-- urlLink St. John Neumann ,  urlLink St. Katharine Drexel  (in Bensalem) and St. Rita. I included all three in my novenas used at Shrines in the U.S. called  urlLink Mention Your Request Here: The Church's Most Powerful Novenas.

        Amy and I watched   the  urlLink MTV hit show The Osbournes  last night, I had turned it on after hearing several new stories about it earlier in the day--although I had caught a brief few minutes of it prior to last night but couldn't make sense of anything that was being said. Last night wasn't much different except it held my interest for the whole half hour. The star of the show, Ozzy Osbourne (of Black Sabbath and biting off bat head fame), is rather lets say an old 53 years old, to quote a piece in the  urlLink Sun Sentinel  is:   At times Osbourne's slurred speech and trembling hands make him seem more like a dotty pensioner than a Prince of Darkness, but even heavy-metal purists do not seem to mind the de-demonization of their idol.  "I don't think his fans have any illusions," said Doc Coyle, lead guitarist of the metal band God Forbid. "Everybody knows his brain is fried."   There in lies the fascination with this show, aging heavy metal rock star in a house filled with pets, two children a rather conservative looking wife and chaos. Through it all Osbourne seems lost. He leans on a cane talking into a phone with the speech coming out as though from a stroke victim--it is incomprehensible. Everyone in the house's language is such that it constantly needs to be beeped out, making interpreting the dialogue akin to receiving a message in morse code.  Highlights from last nights show include:  *Osbourne being told to make a face during a photo shoot and looking blankly at the camera man saying, "this is the only face I got." *The aging Ozzy jumping during a concert against his doctor's orders and having to be carried off stage in pain. *The heavily tatooed Osbourne sitting with cane, counseling his son against the use of alcohol and drugs saying, "If everyone went out and got a tatoo, would you have to?" and at another point a more poignant point, "Do you want to end up like me?"  Perhaps this last statement is the public service value of the show, Osbourne at 53 asking his audience in slurred speech holding his cane, "  Do you want to end up like me?"

        The Boston situation seems   to deteriorate by the minute. Now the  urlLink Boston Herald  is reporting that the accused priest Paul Shanley claimed in 1995 that he had been sexually abused in the seminary himself by another priest and one of the predecessors of either Cardinal Law or Cardinal O'Connor:   Shanley stated in a Sept. 25, 1995, letter to one of his clerical supervisors, Rev. Brian Flatley, that he was himself ``sexually abused as a teenager and later as a seminarian'' by a priest and by the ``predecessor to one of the two cardinals who now debate my fate.''   The unitiated will imediately presume that he is referring to Medieros or Cooke the immediate predecessors of Law and O'Connor, but since he says that he was  a seminarian at the time it could be someone else. Anyone who preceeded Law and O'Connor in Boston and NY would be considered their "predecessors"; Cardinal Cushing would have been the Archbishop of Boston when Shanley was a seminarian, he was succeeded by Cardinal Medeiros, in New York Cardinal Spellman would have been the Archbishop of New York when Shanley was a seminarian, he was succeeded by Cardinal Cooke (whose cause for Canonization has been introduced by Father Benedict Groeschel). In regard to Medeiros, there has already been  urlLink one story  accusing him of abusing someone. It received little attention at the time it was released, partly because it seemed pretty lame to accuse someone who is not around to defend himself.   An amazing document that has been released by this Shanley incident is a  urlLink letter  that was written by Cardinal Medeiros to Cardinal Seper in the Vatican in 1979. In it Medieros says:   'Where large numbers of homosexuals are present in a seminary, other homosexuals are quickly attracted. Other healthier young men tend to be repelled.   In the letter itself, he claims that this was the case in Boston but that they had cleaned it up. This is the first time, to my knowledge that we have any public admission (albeit after the fact) that the hierarchy was aware of this problem. If Medeiros was a guilty party, one wonders what he really was doing to clean it up.

       Quote of the Day:    "Never admit that a particular area of your life is a 'defeated' one.  Because you failed, perhaps many times, in a certain situation does not mean that you must be resigned to defeat. It does not mean that victory was not very close.  My child, you will experience the joy of resolutely uniting yourself with Me  (Jesus),  and meeting difficult places victoriously.   No environment, no set of circumstances, need prove impossible for you, if you believe that My victory with you extends to  every  area. I look for that readiness (completely trusting Me), to enter, once more, those scenes of crushing defeat, and  this  time to prove that on all previous occaisions you could have been a victorious person!"

        Today is the one year aniversary   of my mother-in-law's death. We are having masses said for her both at our parish church and here at our chapel at OSV. Please remember her in your prayers today!  She was a big promoter of the  urlLink Latin Mass  and joined those who felt that the present church (post Vatican II) was had broken with tradition too much. Much could be said for this position, not that Vatican II was heretical but the way that it has been implemented certainly has led a fair number down that road. In her honor, I offer the following prayer, in Latin:   Dies irae, dies illa  solvet saeclum in favilla:  teste David cum Sibylla.   Quantus tremor est futurus,  quando judex est venturus,  cuncta stricte discussurus!   Tuba mirum spargens sonum  per sepulcra regionum,  coget omnes ante thronum.   Mors stupebit et natura,  cum resurget creatura,  judicanti responsura.   Liber scriptus proferetur,  in quo totum continetur,  unde mundus judicetur.   Judex ergo cum sedebit,  quidquid latet apparebit:  nil inultum remanebit.   Quid sum miser tunc dicturus?  Quem patronum rogaturus,  cum vix justus sit securus?   Rex tremendae majestatis,  qui salvandos salvas gratis,  salva me fons pietatis.   Recordare, Jesu pie,  quod sum causa tuae viae:  ne me perdas illa die.   Quaerens me, sedisti lassus:  redemisti Crucem passus:  tantus labor non sit cassus.   Juste judex ultionis,  donum fac remissionis  ante diem rationis.   Ingemisco, tamquam reus:  culpa rubet vultus meus:  supplicanti parce, Deus.   Qui Mariam absolvisti,  et latronem exaudisti,  mihi quoque spem dedisti.   Preces meae non sunt dignae:  sed tu bonus fac benigne,  ne perenni cremer igne.   Inter oves locum praesta,  et ab haedis me sequestra,  statuens in parte dextra.   Confutatis maledictis,  flammis acribus addictis:  voca me cum benedictis.   Oro supplex et acclinis,  cor contritum quasi cinis:  gere curam mei finis.   Lacrimosa dies illa,  qua resurget ex favilla  judicandus homo reus.   Huic ergo parce, Deus:  pie Jesu Domine,  dona eis requiem. Amen.    For those of us not that conversant with Latin, first I offer an explanation of what this is from the  urlLink Catholic Encyclopedia , and  urlLink an English translation   .

      I can't imagine how Cardinal Law will survive these latest revelations that are  breaking news today  urlLink Boston Globe  of a priest who had a very long and sordid history of abusing young men:   Later, in 1997, Law drafted a letter to then-New York Cardinal John O'Connor supporting Shanley's effort to be named director of Leo House, a Catholic-affiliated New York City hostel even though "some controversy" had followed Shanley to New York. "If you do decide to allow Father Shanley to accept this position, I would not object," Law wrote.   The letter was never sent because O'Connor said he would not approve Shanley's appointment, according to other church documents.    1997 is pretty late in the game for this to be still going on. It is good to see that Cardinal O'Connor didn't accept him.

        Today is the Feast of the Annunciation   (the name of this blog). Normally the  Feast of the Annunciation  is on March 25th, but because that occurred during Holy Week this year, the feast is transferred to today. You may notice that the Scripture quote that I use to go with this page is from the annunciation to Zechariah, part of the reason I chose his annunciation is because like him I too have often been silent, awaiting the right moment to speak. Mary, on the other hand expressed faith at her annunciation and I ask her intercession on all that read these pages--that she might use these words to bring all to a deeper relationship with Our Lord.   Since reading  urlLink Goodbye, Good Men  written by  Michael S. Rose , I have thought a lot about my own experiences as a student in two different seminaries in the 1980’s. Rose, in an email to me, criticized my comments and asked if I was so knowledgeable why I had not written a book about these experiences.  He is right, and I commend him for doing the research and putting together an expose based on the accounts of those he interviewed, but I have decided to highlight the lowlights of my experiences in the seminary and then to offer my own critique of the current crisis in the Church. This is Part I of several to come.    Part I. St. Meinrad College   I attended Saint Meinrad College Seminary in southern Indiana in the early 1980’s. At the time the school had the reputation of being a “liberal” seminary. I would say,  it was in some ways, but fairly orthodox in others. Staffed and owned  by the Benedictine monks, one could find on the faculty monks who still celebrated the mass in Latin as well as those who barely believed anything at all. The college closed in the late 90’s, the School of Theology continues and enjoys a much better  reputation these days. I will list my positive experiences first, then the negative.   Positive Experiences:   Located in a monastic environment, spirituality literally hung in the air at Saint Meinrad. The monks prayed regularly throughout the day; wore the recognizable Benedictine habit, the grounds were expansive and there were hundreds of places to pray and meditate.   The history and gift that the Benedictines were and continue to be to the area dominates my memories of St. Meinrad.  The faculty was first rate. The courses were excellent.   I mention several bad priests below, but the majority of the priests who I encountered in the classroom,  in the confessional and lived with were great men. Some were very holy.   I used to confess to an eighty year old monk who was well known among conservative Catholics, a  devote to the reported apparitions at Garanbandal.  He was a great and holy priest who died about ten years ago.  Another good monk was my spiritual director and is now the Archabbot of the monastery there. He has remained a very good friend of mine and now also my wife. He authored a great book of mediations called  urlLink Latin Sayings for Spiritual Growth  for Our Sunday Visitor about a year ago (you can click on the Amazon link for a peak at the inside of the book).  I continue to treasure the way the monks pray there and try to visit the monastery at least once a year. All of the people connected with my negative experiences are no longer there.   I also sense a profound change in the spirit of the monastery as well as the seminary there now. It is important to note that all of those that I mention below were removed from any teaching or positions of authority (I can only assume because I was not alone and that others reported these activities to the proper authorities and they acted).   Negative Experiences:   1. I had barely settled in my dorm room when I received a phone call from another seminarian who was from my diocese. He asked me to come to his room. I had only met this student once before, during a summer get together, so I did not know him all that well.   Upon entering his room and after exchanging pleasantries, he asked me if I was gay. I told him I was not. He then told me that I would never last at the seminary if that was the case. He said that everyone was gay there.  At this point,  I made my way to the door and I can only faintly recall how upset and unsafe this made me feel.   On my way back to my room, I met another seminarian from my diocese and told him what had just happened. He told me that I must have misunderstood. I told him that I had not, that X had been very clear in what he had told me.  The next day the seminarian was gone. Someone whispered that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. I breathed a sigh of relief, presuming that this explained what had happened to me.  Two priests befriended me rather quickly.   2. One was conservative and seemed entertained by my youthful idealism.  He was in his mid-50's at the time. Always wore his habit (just about all of the priests did), and was in a position of authority within the seminary.  When I expressed an interest in relics, he showed up at the door with a gift of First Class Relics. A few days later, I mentioned a fondness for icons, later the same day a gift of an icon was waiting for me  on my desk.    He would grab me in the hall and hug me in a way that made me very uncomfortable, but when I mentioned this to him, he said I was just too uptight.   When my birthday came in November he told me that he wished to offer Mass for me. I asked if a few of my friends might come too, he said no they should go to the community mass—this would be his special gift to me. He celebrated Mass, I did the readings and afterwards he invited me to his cell. He poured two glasses of wine and made small talk about his parents in South Florida and how he had a special place in his heart for the Florida seminarians. At some point, he asked me why I was sitting the way I was sitting. Confused, I asked him what he was talking about. He said, “you have your legs spread open.”   I looked down, only to see that I really didn’t and I couldn’t figure out what in the hell he was talking about. I told him he was crazy. A few minutes later I finished the wine and told him I had to go. He protested but I insisted, suddenly feeling very uncomfortable at even being in his presence.  Later that evening when I told a friend of mine what had transpired he said that it was clear that Fr. X was putting the make on me. I protested this, but from that day forward I kept my distance.   Fr. X for his part seemed hell bent on getting me thrown out. At this point I went up to him and told him that he had better stop trying to make trouble for me or I would go to my Bishop. This worked, but from that day to the present this priest who claimed me as such a “great” friend would not even look at me or return a greeting if we passed in a hall. In fact he was removed from his position in the seminary at the end of that year and blamed me for this (even though I had never told anyone other than my friend).  He is still a priest but presently not living in the United States.  3. Another priest, not a Benedictine and known to be rather out in left field (this seems a better description than liberal) also befriended me, although it would be fairer to say that he befriended everyone.   He invited several friends of mine to go out with him (if I remember right we all were in his class at the time), one night when he found us all deep in study. We took some beer and he drove around the countryside talking about theology. At some point someone in the car said they had to go to the bathroom. He stopped the car at a covered bridge and instructed the guy to stand on the bridge and to relieve himself off the side between the slats. The guy did it and the rest of us all did the same, except for the priest who held a flashlight shining it through the slats. One of my friends took me to the side and said he was checking us out. I asked him what he met. He said that the priest had been shining the light on our privates, checking them out.  A few months later, during spring break, this same priest took about four seminarians with him south to Fr. Lauderdale for Spring Break. When they returned they told tales of sun bathing nude with him on the roof of the hotel (and getting sun burnt). I believe that this priest was sent for treatment (alcohol abuse) and I know that he is now retired for medical reasons (not sure what the medical problem is,  but I can presume).  4. The seminary community was very divided between those who flaunted an effeminate campiness and those who were macho. I think this is not uncommon in all male environments where certain males take on feminine roles. At the time I figured that most of the effeminate guys were homosexual and that all of the others were heterosexual. I know that this was not the case. Some of both groups were homosexual and the rest were heterosexual.  Also there was no sense that one group was liberal and the other conservative. When I arrived at St. Meinrad some of the outdoor shrines were overgrown. I made it my personal mission to clear the overgrowth and to restore them so that they might be used (happily this contribution has been continued by subsequent seminarians for over twenty years now). Among those who offered both physical and financial support to this project were some of the most effeminate students.  After the first year at Saint Meinrad, no one bothered me. I only heard about what others experienced. One young seminarian claimed that he had been taken by the president of the student body to an adult bookstore and shown homosexual erotic films. Afterwards the president of the student body and driven them back to the school and asked them if they were “horny.” When they claimed that they were not he said that he was and proceeded to masturbate in their presence and bar them from leaving the room. He was asked to leave the seminary at the end of the year, but was later ordained for another diocese and continues to function as a priest in the United States. One of the victims of his act who I recently heard from is happily married and a father.   What I Learned:   Before I came to the seminary another seminarian at another seminary had taken me aside and warned me that I would find the greatest sinners and the greatest saints living side by side in the seminary. This was the backdrop of my experience. I never confused the bad with the good and through it all my faith only grew.  It seemed for the most part, that the bad were dealt with at St. Meinrad, although bishops seemed at times reluctant to let go of guys who were very marginal candidates (not because of their orientation but because of their lack of integrity).   In Part II, I will relate my experiences at a more conservative seminary.

        When Our Lord appeared   to St. Faustina in Poland at the beginning of the last century,in the 1930's, hardly anyone went to communion. People did not believe, really believe that God loved them. Now at the beginning of the next century a lot of people go to communion on any given Sunday, but I sense that people still do not believe that God really loves them--now they receive Him more out of convention than conviction.  There are some (mostly priests) who have a problem with the Pope naming today the Feast of Mercy. Our pastor, in his homily which featured Tibetian Monks as the real preachers of compassion, said that he felt the Divine Mercy novena interferred with the Easter Triduum (how that is the case I have no idea--could praying the stations of the cross, another devotion, ruin Good Friday?). I have heard others say that it brings back magical notions of easy grace.  Fr. George Kosicki, who has written widely about this devotion, told me that the associations of Mercy with the Octave of Easter can be traced back to St. Augustine, so that should satisfy the liturgical purists to some degree.   But the issue may be why has this devotion become so popular? Here is my simple answer. Even though we hear it time and time again--that God loves us, we have a very hard time believing it. We keep put conditions upon his love. God would love me if I (fill in the blank) or God will love me when I (fill in the blank), etc. Paul tells us that "while we were sinners God loved us." That pretty much goes against everything that most of us believe.  So here at the beginning of the new century we have this feast which is like a clanging cymbal. Hey guys, in case you made it through all of Lent and Holy Week and you still don't get it--I love you!  Remember the story of Hosea. Hosea is told by God to marry a prostitute, she is an apt symbol for Israel, God tells Hosea. I might add she is an apt symbol for our level of faithfulness. Hosea does as God asks and after awhile his prostitute wife goes back into business. God tells Hosea to take her back (perhaps some of us can still feel the horror of what God was asking Hosea to do). God's love is like that. There is nothing you or I will ever be able to do to earn it, anymore than a child needs to earn his parent's love--it just is.  On this Feast of Divine Mercy, open your heart to that Love that God has for you. Let it flood your being, let it change your life!  Every second of the day is an opportunity to receive God's love. Every moment is a choice. When we allow God to love us, we want to pray, we want to learn more about God, and we want others to experience the peace and joy that we feel.  Too often all of this gets muddled by pharisees who are afriad that something is not being done in the correct way, or violating some liturgical principle (it is interesting how the very same pharisees have trouble genuflecting to the Eucharistic Presence of Our Lord at the consecration--not that I'm watching {Lord fill me with your love so I won't notice!}).    Here is the Divine Mercy message  in a nutshell from the  urlLink Marian Helpers Site :   A -- Ask for His Mercy. God wants us to approach Him in prayer constantly, repenting of our sins and asking Him to pour His mercy out upon us and upon the whole world.   B -- Be merciful. God wants us to receive His mercy and let it flow through us to others. He wants us to extend love and forgiveness to others just as He does to us.   C -- Completely trust in Jesus. God wants us to know that the graces of His mercy are dependent upon our trust. The more we trust in Jesus, the more we will receive.    That is it, ASK, BE, and TRUST.

        In Defense of Thomas, the doubter.     This Sunday   which now is the  Feast of Divine Mercy  is also the Sunday where we hear the story of the Apostle Thomas who is not locked in the room with the other surviving (minus Judas) Apostles. He always gets a bad rap, undeservedly so, I would say. Of course my reasons are that I often share his lack of belief when the messengers aren't acting exactly like they believe.  Remember on the way to Jerusalem, one of the Apostles had pointed out that a certain death awaited Jesus if he went back to Jerusalem.Jesus undeterred continues to journey toward Jerusalem.Thomas is recorded as saying, " Let us also go, that we may die with him,"  (John 11:16). This is the voice of a believer not a doubter, ready to die for and with Our Lord. Later when Jesus says, " You know the way that I am going ," and Thomas doesn't understand he says so, " Lord we do not know where you are going, how can we know the way?"  (John 14). Jesus replies,  "I am the way ."  So we reach the moment after the crucifixion has passed whe Scripture tells us, " On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews,"  (John 20:19). We find out later that Thomas was not with them, why not? Remember that they were in the room for "fear", Thomas had said "let us go to die with him." He was not afraid, he was out and about his business. This also explains when he comes back to the disciples still locked in the room that he does not believe them. Why should he? If the Lord is alive, why are they so filled with fear?  When Jesus appears to him, he believes! Our Lord tells him and us that "Blessed are those who have not seen and believe." It is very easy to doubt whe we see modern day Apostles locked behind clerical doors for fear of the press, or scandal, or law suits, or the laity. It is easy to wonder if they really believe in the power of the risen Lord, but guess what among the Apostles there are Thomas out there, who are open, unafraid and living examples who act without concrete proof but only their faith. We need more Thomas' in the Church today--this would truly be a gift of the Lord's Mercy to us.

        Dr. Leon J. Podles   has an interesting piece in  urlLink Touchstone  that you can read online about the current mess. It is entitled, " urlLink Catholic Scandals: A Crisis for Celibacy?"  In the piece he mentions an incident that happened to him when he entered a seminary some years ago:   In the 1960s, I thought I might have a vocation, and I applied to a seminary program. Other applicants and I went through a psychological evaluation that may have been aimed at weeding out general nut cases and homosexuals. It failed on both accounts. In retrospect I would guess that a quarter of the people in the program were homosexuals or effeminate. My roommate was a homosexual, and when he approached me, I left the seminary within hours.   He wrote me a letter after reading my reflections on  Goodbye, Good Men  and expanded upon this incident:   He   (referring to the Homosexual roommate)  was also very conservative in liturgy and theology. This combination is  not unusual.  Mark Jordan writes about it in  The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism . Perhaps because Christianity has become feminized, it has attracted men who have problems with their masculinity. One problem (not necessarily the worst one) is homosexuality. The high church homosexual, well known in Anglicanism, is becoming more prominent in  Catholicism.    Leon is the author of  The Church Impotent: The Feminization of Christianity   which is published by Spence Publishing, a book I read and enjoyed several years ago. He is also writing another book that Spence will publish:  Sinning Priests, Weak Bishops, and the Future of the Roman Catholic Church .

        Happy Birthday   to our son  Joseph  today who has reached the age of 1. It is really incredible to watch a child grow and also watch them discover the wonders of the world and to rediscover it with him. He is truly a blessing for both his mother and me. He teaches us the grace of contemplating the world around us and also reminds us that we need to care for each other.    A Benedictine priest  , a fellow conservative, who attended one of the same liberal seminaries that I did at about the same time wrote to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the situation in regard to the current crisis. His letter also reminded me that it is really necessary to pray for priests. Please take a moment to do just that.

I'm responsible for  urlLink Mary-Louise  writing a book that  urlLink  Our Sunday Visitor published. She is a great speaker and had a great crowd also.

        I continue to get mail   based on the review of  Goodbye, Good Men  that I did below.  The author didn't like it. Others have written sharing their own experiences which back up my view.   Again, for the record, I liked the book because Rose is bringing to the forefront a problem that exist, my problem with it is that he limits the problem to one type of seminary and type of sponsoring bishop. Unfortunately, the problem is much deeper than that, but at least those who have no knowledge that a problem exist will have their eyes openned by reading Rose's book when it comes out.

        We attended Archbishop Myer's   mass yesterday at the openning of the NCEA convention. He made an allusion to "what a difference a year make" (he forbid any teachers from his diocese last year from attending the conference), but largely just quoted from the NCEA mission statement and really did not challenge those in attendance enough, I thought.

        We are in New Jersey   at Caesars for the NCEA Convention. Not sure why they are having it here.  "Gambling with the Future of Catholic Youth"  or  "We Have No King but Caesar"  might have been good titles for the conference (Navigating the Future is the title I think). Anyway large statues of Caesar and slot machines now are surrounded by admiring nuns (in habits). Archbishop Myers (formerly of Peoria now of Newark) has the openning Mass today.    Yesterday   Amy, Joseph and I prayed before the body of  St. John Neumann at St. Peter's in Philadelphia . We also visite Franklin Commons, the Quaker Meeting house and ate Philly Cheese Steaks for lunch.

Some religious scholars were angered by Brown's suggestion of a Catholic conspiracy to cover up the truth about Jesus and his claim that Mary Magdalene's status as a prostitute was a case of mistaken identity.  At least one book has been published in response to it -- 'De-coding Da Vinci: The Facts Behind the Fiction of The Da Vinci Code.' "

      Since the sash is a symbolic way of claiming publicly that you are not in communion with the church this makes perfect sense to me.  From  urlLink Yahoo! News - Gay-Rights Activists Denied Communion :    "Priests at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago refused to give the Eucharist to about 10 people wearing the sashes at Sunday Mass. One priest shook each person's hand; another made the sign of the cross on their foreheads.   'The priest told me you cannot receive communion if you're wearing a sash, as per the Cardinal's direction,' said James Luxton, a Chicago member of the Rainbow Sash Movement, an organization of Catholic gay-rights supporters with chapters around the country.   An internal memo from Chicago Cardinal Francis George that became public last week instructed priests not to give communion to people wearing the sashes, which the group's members wear every year for Pentecost. The memo says the sashes are a symbol of opposition to the church's doctrine on homosexuality and exploit the communion ritual. "

      As usual a good report from John Allen who also gives us the ways that bishops who want to ordain homosexuals will get around the document.  From John Allen and  urlLink The Word From Rome May 28, 2004 :    "In fact, however, the document is far from dead.   'The Holy Father wants it, so there will have to be a document,' a senior Vatican official told NCR in late May. This official offered no prediction, however, as to when the document might appear.   As to content, the official said the document would to some extent repeat the norms contained in a 1961 instruction of the Congregation for Religious, titled Religiosorum institution, which stated: 'Those affected by the perverse inclination to homosexuality or pederasty should be excluded from religious vows and ordination.'   One key is what exactly the term 'homosexuality' means. At one pole, a single same-sex attraction experienced years ago and never acted upon might mark someone as 'homosexual.' The other pole might restrict the definition of 'homosexuality' to active and on-going sexual behavior. Most people would probably reject the former as overly strict, and the latter as overly loose. The question, then, is where to fall in between.   The senior Vatican official told NCR the document would likely not settle this question.   'It's not reasonable to expect the Holy See to get into those details,' the official said. 'That's something that almost has to be determined on a case-by-case basis.'   It seems therefore probable that bishops will retain some flexibility in deciding how to apply whatever standards are set out in the document. Dioceses that have a strict policy against the admission of homosexuals will continue, but those who emphasize a candidate's capacity for celibacy, rather than sexual orientation in se, could argue that such a candidate is not 'homosexual' in the sense intended under the norms.   It's possible, therefore, that the thunderclap the document will cause in the press will not be matched by change."

      I still think that the Bishops should focus on closing many of these regional seminaries and then send students to two or three large seminaries where the best priest educators could be located. But given the level of agreement on anything I doubt that is possible.  From  urlLink Scranton Times Tribune :    "Citing a shortage of priests and the lack of those interested in becoming priests, Diocese of Scranton Bishop Joseph F. Martino announced Thursday the shutting of St. Pius X Seminary.   The 41-year-old seminary, which has trained more than 1,100 graduates, will officially close Sunday as the academic year culminates with graduation ceremonies at the University of Scranton."

      I worked for Mike Trainor when I taught at Jesuit High School in Tampa, FL. He was a good man and I was shocked to hear of his death when I was in Cincinnati this past week. Please remember him in your prayers.  From  urlLink The Cincinnati Post :    "Nationally known educator Mike Trainor, who helped build St. Xavier High School into one of the nation's best college preparatory schools, died Tuesday evening at his home in Dayton.   Mr. Trainor, 59, served as principal for the Jesuit, all-boys school in Finneytown from 1978 to 1993, and hired many who still teach at the school today, current principal Dave Mueller said.   'I think in many ways he was considered to be the dean of high school principals in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati,' Mueller said.  Friends remembered Mr. Trainor as a big man, an Ernest Hemingway look-alike, who could dominate a room with his intellect, personality and Irish wit. "

      From  urlLink Tuscaloosa News :   Pope John Paul II on Thursday gave Cardinal Bernard F. Law an official position in Rome, naming the former Boston archbishop who resigned in the sex abuse scandal as head of a basilica.  Law will have the title archpriest of St. Mary Major Basilica, a largely ceremonial post often given to retired prelates.  The 72-year-old Law resigned Dec. 13, 2002, to quell an outcry over his handling of sex abuse cases.  He moved from Boston and became resident chaplain at a convent in Maryland, although he retained his membership on nine Vatican congregations and councils, traveling frequently to Rome. He attended a number of the events during celebrations for John Paul's 25th anniversary as pontiff in October.

      From  urlLink Meet 'God's little hobo' - The Catholic Moment :    "Disabled, abandoned, institutionalized and molested.  Who would fault Virginia Cyr if she had become bitter toward life and angry at God?  She was neither.  Friends marveled how Virginia was full of love and joy, known for her wide smile and rich deep faith, despite the cerebral palsy that kept her in a wheelchair, and despite her mother abandoning her as a little girl.  In her quietest of times, Virginia poured out her heart in daily "letters to Mother" -- to Mary, the Mother of Jesus.   "Mother, here at last I may be with you. I just love typing letters to you, seeing your sweet smile, cuddling close to your heart, being with you in the silence of God. Thank you for being always here to embrace all that is heaven, and earth, in me," she once typed.  Mary became the mother Virginia never had.  In her letters from 1962-66, before Virginia's death on Feb. 3, 1967, at age 24, Virginia reveals her love to the Blessed Mother, along with her prayers, hopes and dreams to join a religious order. Life as a sister was never meant to be."

      From  urlLink Boston.com / News / Local / Mass. / Archdiocese announces that 65 parishes,  60 churches will close :   "The Boston Archdiocese will lose 65 of its 357 parishes in a massive restructuring brought on partly by the sex abuse scandal that aggravated already shrinking Mass attendance and weekly collections.  Archbishop Sean O'Malley announced the parish closings Tuesday, completing a process that began in December when he said the archdiocese would be forced to undergo a major downsizing.  He said the reduction was needed because of declining Mass attendance, a shortage of priests and the inability of the archdiocese to support struggling parishes -- many in older buildings in desperate need of repairs -- in the midst of a financial crisis caused in part by the abuse crisis.

      From  urlLink CNS STORY: :    "Auxiliary Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan of Brooklyn said May 21 that if the bishops do not continue with their sexual abuse audits 'our credibility will be zilch.'  He noted that some bishops thought the audits, undertaken as part of the implementation of the 2002 'Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People,' were too burdensome and wanted to end them now.  One audit has been completed. The U.S. bishops' Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse and the National Review Board reached an agreement May 17 on proposals for conducting a second diocesan audit of child sex abuse prevention policies and on doing a study of the causes and context of the crisis.  The bishops will discuss the proposals during their June 14-19 meeting in Denver."

      From  urlLink Words to live by :    "In Decatur, stay-at-home mother Lisa Cronic also has been studying 'Purpose' with her church group. But she is also one of the millions who have been unable to put down 'The Da Vinci Code.' As part of that novel, Brown writes that the Christian church suppressed goddess worship and that we are no longer in touch with the 'sacred feminine,' a message that has appealed to many female readers.  'I think a lot of women don't want to think that religion is just male-dominated,' Cronic said. 'Women are so rarely even discussed. You have the Virgin Mary or the whore Mary Magdalene. It makes you want to grab on to someone and say, 'How valid is this?' '  So many people have been intrigued by 'Da Vinci,' or confused by it, that an entire counter-'Da Vinci' industry has sprung up to discuss -- and more often rebut --its version of history. At least six new books aim to debunk Brown's presentation, with titles such as 'De-coding Da Vinci' and 'Cracking Da Vinci's Code.'   'It has this veneer of sophistication and intellectualism, and it makes people feel smart about art and history, even though it's just as superficial as the next work of pulp fiction,' said Amy Welborn, author of 'De-coding Da Vinci.'"

      From the  urlLink Dallas News :   Dan Brown finally broke his silence last week. Having declined interviews for months, the author of The Da Vinci Code spoke publicly about his best-selling novel to a New Hampshire audience.   Besides revealing the awfully exciting news that his next novel will feature – wait for it – Freemasons, Mr. Brown told his listeners that there's more to the story than he chose to reveal in his novel. What he spared the public was his finding that perhaps Jesus had survived the crucifixion!   Well, pardon us if after enduring all of Mr. Brown's breathless theorizing about Jesus-the-preacher-of-the-sacred-feminine, husband of Mary Magdalene who was herself revered as a goddess and whose secret (and bones) has been protected by a secret society for 2,000 years – yes, pardon us, if we're inspired to meet Mr. Brown's latest "shocker" with a shrug.   I've been writing about The Da Vinci Code for a year now, and whenever I do, I'm challenged by some to just calm down because, hey, "It's only a novel."   The trouble, however, as I've found through the questions that I'm constantly asked, is that more than a few readers of The Da Vinci Code come away with the impression that it is, indeed, much more than a novel, and contains credible scholarly thinking. They believe this partly because of the novel's use of scholars as characters, but also because Mr. Brown has made such claims himself.

      From  urlLink News4Jax :   A pastor at the First United Methodist Church in Lutz, Fla., is recovering Monday after being attacked and pulled under the water by a 6-foot alligator.  Rick Cabot was going for a morning swim in a nearby lake as part of his triathalon training when he said he felt a gator bite him and then pull him under.  Cabot said he punched the alligator on the nose until he was released.   "I don't know if it was trying to kill me -- it could have done a better job," Cabot said. "I was underwater this whole time, but I don't remember ever feeling panicked or short of breath or anything. I do remember thinking, 'I cannot believe a gator has my leg,' and I think that's when I punched it in the nose."

      It is interesting that this story is emphasized and from my experience at a  number of churches still being ignored.  From  urlLink CNS STORY: LITURGY-WINE May-19-2004 (1,100 words) With photo. xxxn :    "Following up on its recent instruction on the Eucharist, the Vatican has ordered a change in U.S. liturgical norms.  It has ordered that any wine to be used for distributing Communion under both kinds be poured into the individual chalices during the preparation of the gifts, before it is consecrated.  It reversed a widespread custom, codified in U.S. norms approved in 2002, that called for distribution of the consecrated wine into the chalices at the time of the breaking of the bread, just before Communion.  Msgr. James P. Moroney, executive director of the U.S. bishops' Secretariat for Liturgy, said the revised norms are effective immediately, but it is up to each bishop to determine how to implement any liturgical change in his diocese."

      Up at 3:58 as though an alarm had gone off...  Just to clarify, I've been at the Archabbey of Saint Meinrad the past few days. Unlike the Trappist, they do not begin Lauds and Vigils until 5:30 A.M., so there is no reason to get up at 4:00 A.M. when you are here and I haven't wanted to get up at 4:00 A.M.--just have both days and have stayed up until 10:30 P.M. after a fairly strenuous days of hiking around the property with a photographer who is shooting pieces that will be used in upcoming projects.  I love lauds and vigils, but would love it even more if I could keep myself asleep until about fifteen minutes before it started.

Porter married Anne Milner, a former nun he met more than 40 years ago while he was a young seminarian. The two met again three years ago after Milner wrote him a letter in prison.  Porter, 69, was convicted in 1993 of sexually abusing 28 children. Although he completed his prison sentence in January, Porter has remained in custody while state prosecutors seek to have him committed.

      Who Are the Leaders of the Catholic Church in the US?  From  urlLink MSNBC:    Forty-eight Roman Catholic members of Congress have warned in a letter to Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington that U.S. bishops will revive anti-Catholic bigotry and severely harm the church if they deny Communion to politicians who support abortion rights.  The letter's signers, all Democrats, include at least three House members with strong antiabortion voting records.   "For many years Catholics were denied public office by voters who feared that they would take direction from the Pope," they wrote. ". . . While that type of paranoid anti-Catholicism seems to be a thing of the past, attempts by Church leaders today to influence votes by the threat of withholding a sacrament will revive latent anti-Catholic prejudice, which so many of us have worked so hard to overcome."

In an interview due to be published in the June edition of 'Inside the Vatican' magazine, Cardinal James Francis Stafford also said the abuse of Iraqi prisoners was the work of 'barbarians.' An advance copy was made available to Reuters.   Stafford, the former archbishop of Denver who has been working in the Vatican since 1996, said the reasons for starting the war in Iraq were a 'moral failure' because there had been no conclusive proof of weapons of mass destruction.   'Why did the president, the vice-president and the secretary of defense say there was an immediate danger to the peace of American society by the proximate use of weapons that would come from Iraq, either directly or through al Qaeda?' he said.

      The title of this book which recounts his years as a bishop in Poland, is from the Gospels when Jesus comes back to his sleeping disciples and says, "Get up, let us go, see my betrayal is at hand." I always find it interesting when someone uses scripture for a title to see it in the context and wonder what does it mean for that person.  From  urlLink New York Post Online Edition: news :    "In a new autobiography, Pope John Paul II wonders if he has been strict enough in his leadership.   In excerpts printed by Il Giornale newspaper yesterday, ahead of the book's publication tomorrow, the pope says church leaders must admonish people as well as lead them in faith. 'I think that in this aspect, maybe I have done too little. There is always this problem of how to balance authority and service. Perhaps I need to criticize myself for not having tried hard enough to lead,' the pope writes in the book, titled 'Get Up! Let Us Go!' "

      Thanks to Paul for this!  Here is a snipet, but go to the link for the full story...  From  urlLink St. Louis Review Online :    "In order that you have a correct perception of the situation, I offer a reflection on the situation itself, in the context of the Church's understanding of the relationship of a parish to the diocese or archdiocese, and to the universal Church. The reflection both seeks to heal any scandal in the matter and provides us all a good occasion to reflect on the gift of our life in the Church at the parish, diocesan and universal levels.   Closing of Parishes and Parish Funds   To be clear, from the start, it is no part of my thinking or of the thinking of anyone who advises me that St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish should be closed. On the contrary, I have stated repeatedly, both in writing and orally, that I take great pride in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish as a personal parish for Polish-speaking Catholics and Catholics of Polish heritage in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. I have thanked publicly those who have sacrificed so much to keep St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish active and strong. And I have confirmed publicly my intention to help the parish in every way possible, pledging that it will enjoy my fullest support. For example, even though the archdiocese anticipates having fewer priests to assign in the coming years, I have promised to St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish the service of both a priest of the archdiocese and a native Polish priest.

From  urlLink The New York Times > National > Bishop Would Deny Rite for Defiant Catholic Voters :    "In the absence of a unified national position, individual bishops are producing widely diverging directives, causing widespread confusion, said Russell Shaw, Washington correspondent for the Catholic publication Our Sunday Visitor and a former spokesman for the bishops.  'There's probably a rather small number of bishops who are strongly in favor of denying communion,' Mr. Shaw said. 'Probably a somewhat larger but not overwhelming number rather strongly oppose doing that. And the third and far away largest group are those who just wish the whole issue would go away.'   The letter from Bishop Sheridan will undoubtedly intensify the debate, partly because it sounds in places like a political endorsement, Catholic observers said. "

      A number of stories like this are springing up lately. Whether it is laity fighting to save their parish from being closed or priests joining forces against the bishop to triumph some cause at odds with Catholic teaching. These may be isolated incidents or signs of that the bishops are losing control of the faithful in this country...  From  urlLink Parish votes to protect itself :    "A Polish parish at odds with the St. Louis Archdiocese has voted overwhelmingly to release its assets to a Roman Catholic charity -- not the archdiocese -- if the parish ever dissolves.  St. Stanislaus Kosta parish challenged Archbishop Raymond Burke's demand that it relinquish control of $9 million in assets and leadership by a lay board, calling that an unlawful takeover.  Various administrative changes amount to insurance protection in a feud with little hope for compromise, parishioner Roger Krasnicki said. The historic parish has contacted religious orders requesting staff if Archbishop Raymond Burke withdraws its archdiocesan priest. A delegation will seek support at the Vatican."

From  urlLink New Zealand Herald - Latest News :    "A Catholic priest shot to death the mayor of a town in western Mexico early on Wednesday after the pair got drunk and began punching each other during a religious festival, state officials said.   After exchanging blows, the priest whipped out a 9mm pistol and fired four bullets into Lorenzo Ruiz, mayor of Chalpatlahuac, an indigenous town nestled in mountains 220km west of the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo, authorities said.   'It seems they were arguing, these two men. They were at a get-together, they had words and the priest shot the mayor. They were apparently both in a state of drunkenness,' said Guerrero state spokesman Jesus Nava.   Local newspapers said the priest, whom they identified as Lorenzo Cuellar, was arrested after he also shot the mayor's son, injuring him. "

In a private letter made public Tuesday by the newspaper National Catholic Reporter, Chaput and his assistant, Bishop Jose Gomez, castigated Anne Burke, interim chairwoman of the National Review Board for the Protection of Young People.  Chaput and Gomez addressed Burke's claim that bishops held back information and manipulated the board for public relations reasons."

      A lot has happened in the world since the "third" secret of Fatima was released several years ago. On this feast of Our Lady of Fatima there is much to reflect upon in its apocalyptic wording. Let me offer several points to reflect upon...  9/11..."passed through a big city half in ruins"  the Pope... "half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow"  Given below is the complete translation of the original Portuguese text of the third part of the secret of Fatima, revealed to the three shepherd children at Cova da Iria-Fatima on July 13, 1917, and committed to paper by Sr. Lucia on January 3, 1944:    "I write in obedience to you, my God, who command me to do so through his Excellency the Bishop of Leiria and through your Most Holy Mother and mine.   "After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendor that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!'. And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God."

      From yesterday's Office of Readings:   "Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands."  (Revelation 20:4)  This reading occurs every year, but I doubt that the "I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded" was ever more graphic than it was for me as I read those words last night. It makes one think of the death of St. John the Baptist and St. Paul.  There is great sadness in such horrible acts but with our faith in Christ there is great hope of victory that is not of this world.

      Unfortunately, if this is the radical testimony of religious life it might be better unexposed..  From  urlLink Catholic Citizens :    "There's no escaping left wing nuns these days. On May 7, WGN Chicago, radio host Milt Rosenberg hosted a discussion with Sr. Carolyn Farrell, B.V.M., head of the Gannon Center for Women at Loyola University Chicago, Sr. Joan McGlinchey of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, Vicar for Religious in the Archdiocese of Chicago, and Cheryl Reed, author of the new book 'Unveiled: The Hidden Lives of Nuns.'  Traditional Catholic listeners had ample opportunity to be appalled at what was said on the show. WGN listener and Chicagoan Terry Hodges observed that 'the two nuns who appeared were quite representative of those American nuns whom they themselves called 'progressive.' The two hour discussion revealed them quite tolerant of legalized abortion since they understand women to be free 'moral agents,' open to legalizing homosexual unions, women's ordination, yada, yada, yada. Needless to say, neither wears a religious habit. On several occasions during the broadcast, they could be heard snickering under their breath when the host asked them where they stood on several traditional Church teachings and discipline.'  During the program, guest and author Cheryl Reed revealed she was raised Catholic but converted to the Russian Orthodox sect. When Rosenberg asked why she left the Catholic Church, she said primarily because of Church teaching on papal infallibility and birth control issues. Mr. Hodges observed that 'after (Ms. Reed) praised a local Sister of Mercy, described in her book as a student of Buddhism and collector of Buddha statues, I enjoyed the squirming when the (Jewish) host asked if the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith would be as approving of her hobby.'

      Could of used whatever they'll come up with next year, this year.  From  urlLink CNS STORY: SYNOD-EUCHARIST May-10-2004  :    "The recent debate over liturgical abuses and reception of Communion by dissenting Catholics is about to be taken to a global level as the church prepares for the 2005 Synod of Bishops.  The synod's topic is the Eucharist. In recent days, bishops around the world have received a Vatican-prepared thematic outline that focuses in large part on the rules that govern celebration of the Eucharist -- including who should and who should not receive Communion.  The 75-page outline, called the 'lineamenta,' has not been released publicly by the Vatican. Catholic News Service obtained a copy of the document in early May.  The outline emphasizes the sacramental and liturgical norms against shared Communion with most non-Catholics. It repeatedly makes the point that the church does not have the power to give Communion to Catholics living in grave sin, to those 'teaching error' or to 'persons living an immoral life.'  Although the Eucharist is a sacrament of unity, it presupposes 'unity in the faith' for those who would share in its reception, the document said. In that sense, people should not receive Communion in a 'casual, routine manner,' it said."

      I watched "The Word in the World" with Father Michael Manning yesterday as he interviewed a missionary. I came rather late in the discussion and I have no idea if the missionary was a priest or a lay religious--he wore no habit or clerical atire and he was never identified by any title by Father Manning. But what struck me was the missionary's total reduction of the Gospel to a political platform for the restructuring of society. Asked point blank what the message of Jesus was the missionary said, "Jesus preached that we need to believe in ourselves and believe in each other."  I'm sorry but this is not the message of the Gospel. Jesus told people to believe in God and in Him. He told them they needed to die to themselves in order to live in Him. If God is taken out of the equation we do not have love for our neighbors but a political ideology that is exactly the type of messiah that Jesus clearly taught he was not.  It might help if everyone opened the Gospels and got reacquainted with Jesus as he is there without reducing his message because someone tells us that isn't what Jesus really meant.

      In Clearwater, FL...  From  urlLink Tampabay: Teen held in Virgin Mary smashing :    "Angry, bored and unable to sleep, Kyle Maskell grabbed his Marksman slingshot and headed out of his foster home to destroy something that might bring him a degree of infamy that rivaled his rage, police said.  He soon looked up into the image of the Virgin Mary, the iridescent figure that had formed on the side of a glass building on U.S. 19 eight years earlier, drawing throngs of believers to Clearwater.  Maskell reached into the pouch of his slingshot and launched three or four ball bearings, striking the image's top three panes, police said. People who showed up hours later found the virgin beheaded.  That's the story Clearwater police say Maskell, an 18-year-old Clearwater High School sophomore, told them Monday morning before they arrested him on a charge of felony criminal mischief. He was being held at the Pinellas County Jail Monday night in lieu of $10,000 bail.  Police said the teen cried for three hours while recounting his deed. The guilt had eaten at him for more than two months."

      One wonders who does like this music?   From  urlLink Sacred Miscellany :    "Can bad hymns kill? Or can they incite near homicidal rage? This morning it was a near thing for me. Because I have a job as a church choir director/organist at an Episcopal church, I go to the 7 a.m. Mass. Once upon a time, there was no music at the early Masses. However, nowadays any parish with a full-time music director requires music even then. And it can be torture.  I entered the church to the sound of the organ being played in a style usually confined to baseball games and horse shows. It was Marty Haugen's 'Canticle of the Sun.' And no, I don't want to 'play in the forest,' thank you. Then we had Christopher Walker's 'Laudate Dominum.' During Communion, we honored 'Jesus our brother' with Bernadette Farrell's 'Bread of Life.'   This morning was the closest I've ever come to just shouting, 'Oh, be quiet!' Yes, I know that aesthetics don't have anything to do with the validity of the Mass, that Jesus doesn't mind bad music, etc., etc. And no, there isn't a tasteful Eastern Rite parish or a traditional Mass that's less than an hour and a half away.  I go. I grind my teeth. I thank God for the gift of Himself. And I heave a huge sigh of relief, like Pollyanna, that's it's seven days till the next Sunday. Any suggestions on how to avert enraged outbursts or apoplexy will be gratefully received."

Dale Sand and Tom Pepera, who have been together for five years, say their priest has asked them to restrict their participation in church activities after a letter Sand wrote was printed in the Grand Forks Herald on Easter Sunday.  In the letter, Sand responded to previous letters warning against gay marriage and homosexuality in general. He wrote that being gay wasn't a choice and said God had made him that way.  In response, the Rev. Larry Wieseler, who serves at St. Mary's parishes in Baudette, Williams and Falun, telephoned Sand and told him he and Pepera should no longer come up to receive Eucharist during Mass nor serve communion to others or sing in the choir. That led the couple to quit the church in Baudette."

      It wasn't started by Hallmark, you know...  From  urlLink Mothers Day History  :  " The earliest tributes to Mother's Day date back to the annual spring festival the Greeks dedicated to Rhea, the mother of many deities, and to the offerings ancient Romans made to their Great Mother of Gods, Cybele.    Christians celebrated a Mother's Day of sorts during a festival on the fourth Sunday in Lent in honor of Mary, mother of Christ.  In England the holiday was expanded to include all mothers.  It was then called Mothering Sunday.  In the United States it started with one woman named Anna Jarvis.  Jarvis was an Appalachian homemaker and she organized a day to raise awareness of poor health conditions of her community.  She thought the day would be best advocated by mothers and called the day 'Mother's Work Day'.  When Anna Jarvis died in 1905 her daughter, also named Anna, began a campaign to memorialize the life work of her mother.  Anna remembered that her mother said there were many days dedicated to men but not for mothers.  Anna then began to lobby the politicians of the time to support a day dedicated to mothers.  Anna Jarvis talked to many politicians including Presidents Taft and Roosevelt hoping they would support her campaign.    Jarvis organized a church service to celebrate her mother in 1908 and Anna handed out white carnations to those in attendance because the white carnation was her mother's favorite flower.  Anna Jarvis' hard work began to pay off five years after that service in 1913.  The House of Representatives adopted a resolution calling for officials of the federal government to wear white carnations on the day many began calling Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.  Finally on May 8, 1914 President Woodrow Wilson signed a Joint Resolution designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day.

       "In the light of the last few days and all of the media coverage regarding John Kerry's unambiguous support of abortion rights, his personal opposition to abortion, and his insistence on the separation of his Catholic faith from his professional life, I, as a successor of the apostles, cannot remain silent. I, as an apostle, must speak with the apostles and obey God rather than man and present to you the teaching of the Church on the proper relationship between our faith and professional life."  Addressing all Catholics and especially "'pro-choice' Catholics," and "'Catholics for a free choice,'" the bishop said, "Jesus Christ has warned clearly within the Gospel that hell is a reality and that we are free to choose it.   Catholics who separate their faith life from their professional and social activities are putting the salvation of their souls in jeopardy. They risk the  possibility of hell"  "The grave error that has come about, the grave error that the Father of Lies  has planted in the hearts of many is the lie of thinking that we can have one  foot with God and one foot with the world. . . . We must always put the law  of God above the law of man, especially as it concerns the dignity of the human  person and the life of the unborn," said the Bishop. On the point of reception of Communion, Bishop Aquila said: "In regard to the question of sanctions for Catholics who are 'pro-choice', who say that they are personally opposed to abortion but whose words and actions speak otherwise in their support of abortion rights, I would share with them the words from St. Justin Martyr in today's Office of Readings. This was in 165 A.D. They shared the same problems we do today. 'No one may share the Eucharist with us unless he believes that what we teach is true, unless he is washed in the regenerating waters of baptism for the remission of his sins, and unless he lives in accordance with the principles given us by Christ.'"

      I went to school with a number of guys who were studying to be priests for Phoenix in the 1980's.   One of them was a young man who was very homosexual and to the best of my knowledge was never ordained--in fact he left suddenly along with his "lover" amid rumors that both had been married by a former classmate who at the time was a priest in Phoenix. This created quite a buzz at the time.  What is interesting and related to the current issue is that this young man's father was also studying to be a priest at the time at another seminary, one for older vocations. He was ordained and is one of the priests who is ignoring Bishop Olmstead's decree. (As I recall in his case his wife had died).  It will be interesting to see how all of this resolves itself, I think this is the first shots of a war that is about to break out into the open.  From  urlLink 8 Priests Ignore Phoenix Bishop Olmstead :    "A week after they were ordered by the bishop to remove their names from a pro-gay statement, only one of nine Catholic priests who signed the document has complied.   The Rev. Chris Carpenter, pastor of Christ the King Parish in Mesa, said Tuesday in an e-mail to the media that he would remove his name from the Phoenix Declaration 'in fidelity to my promise of obedience and respect for the bishop of Phoenix and in the interest of parish and diocesan unity.'    He said he would continue to offer pastoral care to gay people and to stand with them 'when they are uncharitably or unjustly treated.'   The e-mail followed the publication in the diocesan newspaper and on its Web site of the first of three columns by Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted about homosexuality. Last week, Olmsted sent a confidential letter to the priests demanding they remove their names from the document, prepared by a coalition of Catholic and Protestant clergy called No Longer Silent. Olmsted said the columns are an attempt to respond to the declaration."

The group says its first ad is a response to Washington Theodore Cardinal McCarrick's recent statement that he was not yet 'comfortable' denying the right to participate in the Holy Sacraments to pro-abortion rights political leaders like Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass.  'Pope John Paul II has made clear that 'in cases of outward conduct which is seriously, clearly and steadfastly contrary to the moral norm,' Catholics should not receive Holy Communion,' League President Judie Brown said. 'It is not a question of the cardinal feeling 'comfortable.' It is a question of doing what is right.'  A spokesman for the league said the full-page ads would appear in the Washington, D.C.-area and in in several national publications."

      The strange tales of Bishop O'Brien continue...  From  urlLink East Valley Tribune Online :   " The judge who sentenced Bishop Thomas J. O’Brien to 1,000 hours of community service told the probation department Tuesday not to investigate an allegation that the former Catholic leader is cheating on his hours.  A relative of a worker at Huger Mercy Living Center, 2345 W. Orangewood Ave. in Phoenix, phoned the allegation into the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, saying O’Brien is logging six hours when he shows up there for only an hour. County Attorney Richard Romley announced the allegation Tuesday and complained about the lack of oversight of O’Brien’s probation.   But no formal complaint has been submitted to the probation department, and any investigation now would be premature because O’Brien’s logs are due quarterly, said J.W. Brown, a Maricopa County Superior Court spokeswoman.   'There’s nothing to investigate,' Brown said.   Logs that O’Brien has submitted so far show the most he has ever claimed at Huger Mercy Living Center was three hours, said Mike Goss, spokesman for the county Adult Probation Department.   Romley said he will pass on the allegations to probation. "

      As I recall he is in a marriage not recognized by the church also.  From  urlLink Governor won't take Eucharist in public :    "Gov. James E. McGreevey, continuing to clash with Roman Catholic Church leaders over his support for abortion rights, said yesterday he would comply with the wishes of Newark Archbishop John J. Myers and not seek Communion at public Masses.   Myers yesterday issued a five-page pastoral statement that said it was 'objectively dishonest' for Catholics who support abortion rights to seek Communion. While not naming McGreevey, Myers wrote, 'On this grave issue, public officials cannot hold themselves excused from their duties, especially if they claim to be Catholic.' "

      Go to  urlLink  for the full entertaining piece, but here is a snipet:    "As should be painfully clear by now, the entire fiasco was, as is so often the case, all about me.  Not, in my opinion, unlike the upcoming Boston College Conference. If you go to the conference web-site, you will find that there is no mention of the Name of Jesus. What does that tell you? Is there no room for Jesus in the "Church That Women Want?"  The first workshop is entitled: "Women Leaders Creating Church."  I'm not kidding!  Never mind that Jesus Christ created His Church a couple of thousand years ago. These dames -- excuse me, "leaders"-- apparently believe they can do a better job.  These "ladies" --like that insufferably arrogant would-be cheerleader --seem to believe, God help them, that the Church is all about them.  Among the distinguished panelists is Sister Jeannine Gramick, Ph.D., National Coalition of American Nuns, Executive Committee; Consultant, Lesbian and Gay Ministry.   Good grief."

      The audience thought it was part of the "act"...  From  urlLink News :    "Theatregoers at one of Madrid's most venerable arts centres became unwitting witnesses to religious violence last weekend when irate zealots broke up a performance of the play In God we xxxx.  Shouting 'Viva Cristo Rey,' two men launched themselves from the audience at the Circulo de Bellas Artes and beat up the actor and playwright of Me cago en Dios, directed by Pedro Forero, which for the past week had been making headlines in Spain for its blasphemous title and anti-clerical content.  'They beat us, they destroyed the music equipment, and they tried to set fire to the set, which is made of loo paper,' said the playwright, Inigo Ramirez de Haro. 'The audience thought it was part of the play so no one helped us for ages.'  Ramirez de Haro and the actor Fernando Incera were treated for sprains and bruises. Police arrested the two young men, one of whom is said to serve with the armed forces. Their shouts translated as 'Long live Christ the King', but are also a rallying call to the conservative Catholic Cristo Rey movement."

      From  urlLink Cardinal Newman Society :    "Cardinal Newman Society has issued a shocking new report on scandals at U.S. Catholic colleges and universities that is certain to reignite concerns about the colleges' religious character.   The 56-page report, "The Culture of Death on Catholic Campuses: A Five-Year Review," documents inroads made by advocates of abortion, contraception, premarital sexual activity and physician-assisted suicide onto Catholic college campuses since 1999.  It is the most extensive evidence of problems in Catholic higher education ever compiled in a single source--and yet it only scratches the surface, relying primarily on media reports and college websites.  "'Pro-choice' is no choice for a Catholic institution, which by its Catholic mission must be courageously pro-life," said Erin Butcher, lead researcher and co-author of the report.  "Cardinal Newman Society has responded to scandal after scandal on Catholic campuses, but many Catholics still fail to appreciate the scope of the problem."   The report identifies the problems and suggests solutions to ensure that Catholic colleges uphold their Catholic, pro-life mission. "

From  urlLink St. Meinrad archabbot will resign post :    "Archabbot Lambert Reilly, the spiritual leader and chief administrator of St. Meinrad Archabbey announced Thursday he will step down from his post Dec. 15.  Reilly, 71, first came to St. Meinrad, south of Jasper in Spencer County, as a seminarian student and has served as its leader since 1995.  'He is just a great, great leader,' said Christopher Marten, national chairman of St. Meinrad's $40 million fund-raising drive. The archabbey already has raised $30 million toward its goal, and Marten didn't think the change would affect its success.  The Benedictine monks at St. Meinrad will select Reilly's successor. Reilly is expected to remain there as a monk."

From  urlLink Wichita Eagle | Top of the news :    "State Attorney General Phill Kline presented materials to legislators Thursday alleging that a Kansas City, Kan., abortion provider operated a dangerously substandard medical facility and even ate fetal tissue.  The allegations about the facilities came during a presentation to the House Committee on Federal and State Affairs. 'It's a place where no woman, no person, should have to undergo a surgical procedure,' Kline said.  The allegation that the physician ate fetal tissue was included in written materials that Kline presented to the committee. The report came from a Kansas City police officer; the name of the witness he interviewed was blacked out in documents provided to legislators.  The report, prepared for Kline after officers conducted an investigation of an unrelated theft complaint at the clinic, said officers observed 'filthy' conditions in some parts of the facility and blood stains on the floor."

      Interesting interview on Zenit. He has interesting views on the whole area of homosexuality, and his claim of diocese hiriing mental health professionals who don't agree with Church teaching is right on the mark.  From  urlLink Zenit News Agency - The World Seen From Rome :    "Two different recent studies have found that the answers to a small number of questions about childhood and adolescent experiences, which relate to the development of a positive masculine identity, included within a larger questionnaire, allowed the clinical interviewer to conclude, with 90% accuracy, whether the subject has homosexual attractions.   When the evaluation reveals probable same-sex attractions, the candidate is not automatically excluded from consideration. If he is willing to do the hard work required to come to overcome his emotional pain of male insecurity, sadness and anger, his same-sex attractions could be resolved.   After he no longer identifies himself as a homosexual, he could reapply. The Church should not take the moral risk of allowing someone who identifies himself as a homosexual to enter the seminary.   Also, it is essential that mental health professionals involved in any way with the evaluation of candidates for seminary or with treating seminarians or priests, as well as the faculty at the seminaries, support the teaching of the Church on sexuality, particularly on homosexuality.   In our experience, there are some dioceses and religious communities that rely upon the work of mental health professionals who actively disagree with the Church's sexual morality. Given the specialized nature of evaluating candidates for seminaries we recommend that the psychologists and psychiatrists who engage in this important work be required to participate in ongoing educational programs given by those loyal to the Church's teaching on sexual morality."

The room was filled with people in Amish dress -- men with broad-brimmed hats, women in homemade cotton, little boys with hair cut in the shape of inverted bowls. Except for the closed-circuit camera, it could have been the century before last. Or maybe Salem. "

       urlLink ZENIT News Agency--The World Seen from Rome:     Q: What role is left for women in the Church if they cannot be priests?    Ferrara: It is not a matter of a role "being left for women" but of women embracing their proper role. There has always been plenty for women to do in the Catholic Church.   Remember, the ordination of women in Protestant communities is a recent development. Before then, women had almost no role to play in those denominations. Protestant churches are starkly masculine.   As a Lutheran, I had no female models of holiness to turn to for comfort and guidance. Though many Protestant denominations ordain women, they do not recognize the importance of the feminine -- mother Church embodied in Mary -- in God's plan for salvation.   I do not see why many Catholics discount the importance of the women religious in the life of the Church as if they were second-class citizens. They are our spiritual mothers.   Protestants have never recognized such a role for women. Moreover, there are also all sorts of lay apostolates, orders and associations women can join.

Ferrara, who became Catholic in 1998, recently told her conversion story in 'The Catholic Mystique: Fourteen Women Find Fulfillment in the Catholic Church' (Our Sunday Visitor), which she co-edited with Patricia Sodano Ireland, another former Lutheran pastor.   Ferrara shared with ZENIT how her search for theological justification of women's ordination in Lutheran seminary eventually changed her mind about the priesthood and opened her heart to the Catholic Church.

The pope, 84 and stricken by Parkinson's disease, wants to make the pilgrimage like any of the other ailing pilgrims who go to Lourdes hoping for a cure from waters in a grotto where the Virgin Mary is to have appeared in 1858, they said.  The Polish-born pontiff wants to mark the 150th anniversary of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which states that the mother of Jesus Christ was born free of original sin.  "The pope will come as an ailing person making a pilgrimage to Lourdes ... an ill man among the ill," Bishop Jacques Perrier, head of the local diocese of Tarbes and Lourdes in southwestern France, told journalists this week."

Eventually, the look became 'cheesy' and faded away, Altuna says.  But, like many '80s trends, rosaries 'are cool again' with celebs. It's highly unlikely, however, that the pope will bless the trend this time around, either. Altuna suggests the new fad has roots in the Britney Spears/Madonna connection. "

The closed-door conference includes priests and lay people from 25 countries, focusing on a Vatican report on New Age sects last year.  Monsignor Peter Fleetwood, one of the authors of the report, said the greatest challenge may be in England and North America 'where the New Age began ... and where it has become such a part of everyday life that we don't notice it.' That makes it harder to attack, he says: 'Where one sees a threat, it's easier to battle it.'"

      From  urlLink Diocese of Tucson weighs bankruptcy | The Arizona Daily Star  :    "Lawyers for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson say Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas is making plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.    If the diocese follows through on what its attorneys say is 'the only viable' way to financially resolve pending lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by clergy, it will be the first U.S. Catholic diocese to file for bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy protection, local Catholic parishioners would be in the unprecedented position of being part of a church whose purse strings are monitored by the courts.    Chapter 11 falls under the federal bankruptcy code and is a way for insolvent corporations and others to reorganize debt. Kicanas predicted Tuesday that filing for Chapter 11 could allow the operations of the diocese and its 74 parishes to carry on normally while it makes a plan to pay costs related to the abuse claims.    He compared the scenario to the way United Airlines has continued to fly its planes since filing for bankruptcy protection in December 2002.    Major business decisions would need the approval of bankruptcy court. "

Before asking for forgiveness, it is necessary to know exactly what are the facts and to recognize the shortcomings with respect to the evangelical needs in appropriate cases. This is why the Committee referred to historians whose scientific competence is universally recognized."  John Paul II recalls that on March 12, 2000, a Day of Forgiveness was celebrated and forgiveness was asked "for the errors committed in the service of the truth when unethical methods were used."  This petition for forgiveness "is also valid for the drama related to the Inquisition as well as the wounds that are its consequence. ... This volume," he concludes, "is written in the spirit of this petition for forgiveness."  Cardinal Cottier indicated that the fact that the volume has been published so late is not due "to opposition to its publication. I would like to make that clear. The delay is due to a series of health problems."  Referring to the symposium, in which thirty speakers and experts from Italy, France, Portugal, Malta, England, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Czech Republic, the United States and Canada participated, Prof. Borromeo said they discussed "the events  that led to the Inquisition in the 13th century, the activity in the main places in which heresy flourished (especially France and Italy) and its procedures. When dealing with the modern history of this institution," added Borromeo, "the reports were divided into two categories. One was predominantly geographic (Spain and Portugal with their respective imperial colonies; Italy, with special reference to the Congregation of the Holy Office, the Netherlands and England). The other was mainly thematic: (the repression of the heresies with Jewish and Islamic tendencies, Protestantism and witchcraft were discussed, as well as the battle against circulating prohibited literary and scientific books and Bibles in the vernacular and the historical context in which the abolition of courts took place)."  The acts of the symposium, said Borromeo, "are a point of reference for studies on the Inquisition; in the first place, for the scientific rigor of the reports, exempt from controversy or an apologetic nature which is typical of recent historiography; in the second place, for the richness of the information laid out which allows us to look at many places so widespread among non-specialists (the use of torture and the death penalty were not as frequent as once believed); in the third place, due to the amplitude of the volume, it is a reason to hope that intellectual debate on the theme is sparked and that there is stimulus for new research."

      From  urlLink Fr. Terry Morgan :   Lost in the recent media crush of D-Day’s sixtieth anniversary celebrations, and the week-long mourning of President Ronald Reagan, was a “minor detail” about Pope John Paul’s accommodations for his single night in Bern, Switzerland.  Ordinarily, when the Pope visits a foreign country, he stays at the (appropriately ample) residence of his representative to that nation, his “Nuncio.”  For days, sometimes weeks, the Nuncio’s staff spiffs up the guest suite, prepares the official dining room (ample in its own right), and, in general, makes sure that the place is suitable for the Vicar of Christ on Earth.   On this particular visit, though, the Vicar of Christ spent the night in a local nursing home. This change in venue wasn’t due to the Pope’s Parkinson’s Disease or any of his other ailments.  And at John Paul’s express command, Vatican media representatives had no special statement for the news outlets of the world.   But this Pope – who in his vigorous younger days bounded up steps and with great gusto encouraged the masses, especially the youth of the world, with his constant, “Be not afraid!” – brought his message to his peers, not by his speech or his energy, but by simply being at their side.   I suspect that John Paul’s “overnighters” in Nuncios’ residences are things of the past, now that he has discovered new out-of-town quarters and new out-of-town friends with whom to spend the night.   Is he giving up?  Hardly.  He is simply giving in to God’s special gifts to him at this special time of his life.  Most of us would look on the Pope’s impediments – of speech, mobility, even breathing – as roadblocks to ministry, roadblocks to life.  But John Paul sees these facts of life as gifts, given to him in his twilight, so that he can continue to empty himself and minister to us in ways that no “healthy” younger man could.

      From  urlLink Detroit Tigers News:    The Tigers haven't won five straight since Damion Easley was the starting second baseman in July 2002, but it won't be an easy streak to match. Florida's Dontrelle Willis enters his first start against the Tigers with a 1.35 ERA in his last three starts. Two starts again, he had perfect game going against Cincinnati until Sean Casey's two-out single in the seventh.   The Tigers have run out of former Marlins to start, but they counter with arguably the hottest pitcher in their rotation at the moment. The day Willis threatened to toss a perfect game, Jason Johnson tossed 7 2/3 scoreless innings against Kansas City. He followed that with eight innings and three runs allowed against the Braves on Tuesday.

      From  urlLink Catholics giving governor a pass on abortion? | The San Diego Union-Tribune :    "In January 2003, Sacramento Roman Catholic Bishop William Wiegand publicly chastised then-Gov. Gray Davis for supporting abortion rights while professing to be a Catholic.   Wiegand delivered a homily saying the Democrat and any other Catholic who 'thinks it is acceptable for a Catholic to be pro-abortion is in very great error' and 'puts his or her soul at risk.' He recommended that Davis refrain from taking Communion.   In recent months, a variety of conservative Catholic groups have launched a campaign against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, a Catholic who favors abortion rights. Some bishops have criticized Kerry and other Catholic politicians who support such rights, saying they should be denied Communion.   Yet the Sacramento bishop and other conservative Catholics have steered clear of publicly attacking Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, perhaps the nation's most prominent Republican Catholic who favors abortion rights. "

'We have been flooded with parishioners desperate to leave the country, and as they cannot get an exit permit without a baptismal certificate from the church we have been swamped with requests. ...

      From  urlLink An Open Letter to the American Bishops :   Some of you may recall that I was press secretary of your bishops’ conference from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. Those also were difficult times, and one reason was that the bishops of those days made things worse by usually refusing to admit the fact. Most of them were likable, decent men, yet they were overly fond of a form of euphoric rhetoric that I eventually came to think of as “happy talk.”  Faced with theologians who challenged Church doctrine, defecting priests, ferocious feminist nuns, growing religious illiteracy, and countless other troubles, many of those bishops chose to see such things as the growing pains of renewal. On the whole, they insisted, we were on the right track; everything would turn out for the best. Pope John XXIII’s words about “prophets of doom” profoundly shaped their thinking, mostly for the worse.  Looking back, I can’t help wondering whether the bishops of that era took the same resolutely upbeat view of priestly sex abuse. In any event, we now know that prophets of doom are sometimes right. And although the abuse scandal has pretty much driven euphoria from your own repertoire, something just as bad may be taking its place. I mean the suggestion that you may soon be able to put this nasty episode behind you and return to business as usual. If that’s the conventional wisdom in Denver, the crisis of American Catholicism will become even worse, even more destructive, than it already is. Business as usual isn’t the answer.

      In the piece it mentions all but two have removed their names, but only one is being punished? Perhaps the other is the religious brother?  From  urlLink Bishop Olmsted Suspends Priest for Refusing to Remove Name from Gay Document :    "Following Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted's April order that nine priests and one religious brother remove their names from a document by an activist organization for homosexual clergy, all have complied except for Fr. Andre Boulanger. Last week bishop Olmsted suspended Fr. Boulanger from priestly ministry.  The document, No Longer Silent: Clergy for Justice, stated 'Homosexuality is not a sickness, not a choice, and not a sin. We affirm that GLBT persons are distinctive, holy, and precious gifts to all who struggle to become the family of God.'  Within two weeks of bishop Olmsted's order, eight of the ten had removed their names; last week, the ninth, but Fr. Boulanger defiantly persisted in his stand.   A suspension means a priest may not celebrate Mass, preach or hear confessions. Olmsted told Fr. Boulanger his suspension stands 'until such time as I have assurance from you that you do indeed believe and teach what the Church teaches about the call to holiness for homosexual persons,' according to an Arizona Republic article."

        urlLink LETTER TO THE BISHOPS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THE COLLABORATION OF MEN AND WOMENIN THE CHURCH AND IN THE WORLD   Released Today. Among other issues, presents a Biblical basis for the separation of the sexes.   First those that result from the Fall:   Original sin changes the way in which the man and the woman receive and live the Word of God as well as their relationship with the Creator. Immediately after having given them the gift of the garden, God gives them a positive command (cf. Gn 2:16), followed by a negative one (cf. Gn 2:17), in which the essential difference between God and humanity is implicitly expressed. Following enticement by the serpent, the man and the woman deny this difference. As a consequence, the way in which they live their sexual difference is also upset. In this way, the Genesis account establishes a relationship of cause and effect between the two differences: when humanity considers God its enemy, the relationship between man and woman becomes distorted. When this relationship is damaged, their access to the face of God risks being compromised in turn.  God's decisive words to the woman after the first sin express the kind of relationship which has now been introduced between man and woman: “your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you” (Gn 3:16). It will be a relationship in which love will frequently be debased into pure self-seeking, in a relationship which ignores and kills love and replaces it with the yoke of domination of one sex over the other. Indeed the story of humanity is continuously marked by this situation, which recalls the three-fold concupiscence mentioned by Saint John: the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life (cf. 1 Jn 2:16). In this tragic situation, the equality, respect and love that are required in the relationship of man and woman according to God's original plan, are lost.    Then from the New Testament and how Christ overcomes this Fall for those who believe in Him:  “For all of you who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ... there is neither male nor female”, writes Saint Paul to the Galatians (3:27-28). The Apostle Paul does not say that the distinction between man and woman, which in other places is referred to the plan of God, has been erased. He means rather that in Christ the rivalry, enmity and violence which disfigured the relationship between men and women can be overcome and have been overcome. In this sense, the distinction between man and woman is reaffirmed more than ever; indeed, it is present in biblical revelation up to the very end. In the final hour of present history, the Book of Revelation of Saint John, speaking of “a new heaven and a new earth” (Rev 21:1), presents the vision of a feminine Jerusalem “prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (Rev 21:2). Revelation concludes with the words of the Bride and the Spirit who beseech the coming of the Bridegroom, “Come, Lord Jesus!” (Rev22:20).    Purpose of the document as stated in the Introduction is to spark conversation. I think it will certianly do that.

      From  urlLink Zenit :  We should take the devil "very seriously," but without losing confidence in the love of God, says the theologian of the Pontifical Household. Cardinal Georges Cottier gave this interview in the wake of last Saturday's murder of a priest in the cathedral of Santiago, Chile. The killing was linked to Satanism.   Q: In the great mystery of evil, how much does the action of the devil count and how much responsibility does man bear?  Cardinal Cottier: The devil is without a doubt the great seducer because he tries to lead man to sin by presenting evil as good. But the fall is our responsibility, because the conscience has the ability to distinguish what is good and what is evil.  Q: Why does the devil want to induce man to sin?   Cardinal Cottier: Out of envy and jealousy. The devil wants to drag man with him because he himself is a fallen angel. The fall of the first man was preceded by the fall of the angels.  Q: Is it a heresy to affirm that the devil also forms part of God's plan?   Cardinal Cottier: Satan was created by God as a good angel, because God does not create evil. Everything that comes from the creative hand of God is good. If the devil has become evil, it is by his own culpability. It was he who, by using his freedom badly, made himself evil.

      From one of the comments. Can someone give me a citation of where it is from? I'd like to use it in the book.   Something to remember here is that Tolkien is undoubtedly speaking about Mass before Vatican II for all those who tend to think that everything was perfect back then.    J. R. R. Tolkien said:       "I can recommend this as an exercise: make your Communion in circumstances that affront your taste. Choose a snuffling or gabbling priest or a proud and vulgar friar; and a church full of the usual bourgeois crowd, ill-behaved children -- from those who yell to those products of Catholic schools who the moment the tabernacle is opened sit back and yawn -- open necked and dirty youths, women in trousers and often with hair both unkempt and uncovered. Go to Communion with them (and pray for them). It will be just the same as a Mass said beautifully by a visibly holy man, and shared by a few devout and decorous people. (It could not be worse than the mess of the feeding of the Five Thousand -- after which our Lord propounded the feeding that was to come."       Thanks to Elaine! It is from here:       &nbsp;

      From  urlLink Scranton Times Tribune :    "An allegation about the incident 'recently' made its way to the diocese, according to spokeswoman Maria Orzel. When confronted, Father Shoback admitted responsibility and faced immediate removal from the ministry, according to a diocesan statement.  Ms. Orzel would not specify when the diocese received the allegation or when Father Shoback was officially removed. She said he was gone before the Most Rev. Bishop John M. Dougherty, auxiliary bishop, addressed the congregation during Saturday Mass."

      At 27!  Wannstedt should probably do the same before he is fired.  From  urlLink Dolphins' Ricky Williams retiring from NFL :    "The Dolphins' series of off-season headaches turned into a crisis this weekend when star running back Ricky Williams told coach Dave Wannstedt he is retiring - a week before training camp.  Despite attempts by friends and colleagues to talk him out of quitting, Williams said Saturday he was overjoyed by his decision, one that has been months in the making.  'You can't understand how free I feel,' Williams said before boarding a plane in Hawaii and heading to Asia to begin several months of travel. Williams, 27, has played five years in the NFL, including the first three with New Orleans. He said he plans to file his retirement papers with the NFL on Monday or Tuesday."

       Is it I Lord?   On the night before he died, Jesus shocked the gathered disciples with, "One of you is about to betray me." Everyone of them questioned him, "Is it I, Lord?" except for Judas who said, "Is it I, Teacher?"  In one of my favorite Churches there is a massive icon of Our Lord as teacher and judge. It looms over you as soon as you enter the church. It is not a kind and peaceful Jesus, but a Jesus who comes again to judge the living and the dead. Whenever I enter that church I think of Our Lord's Last Supper and find myself asking him, "Is it I, Lord?"    Am I worshipping you alone or do I place an idealogy above you?  Do I seek first the Kingdom of God or am I serving some other king?  Do I listen for your voice or does the accuser (Satan) keep me from hearing you?  Do I seek to be the judge or am I content to allow you to judge?   In a nutshell, am I handing over Christ or receiving Him at the Eucharist?

       Thanks to all who have left comments so far on the posts below, if you haven't commented yet please do add your comments. I was mentioning to Amy the general tone of most of the comments (you can read them for yourselves under the appropriate posts)and in a nutshell she captured the ultimate source of frustration--powerlessness to change the situation. Ironically, if you quizzed the majority of priests, liturgists, choir directors about the state of the liturgy they would all say exactly the same thing. Who they would blame would differ depending upon who you asked but I know from experience that just about everyone involved feels the situation is out of their control. I even heard Cardinal Arinze speak to this recently.   Feel free to comment on this, it is a work in process and all the reaction helps me to clarify my thoughts.     So where do we start and I mean all of us?     Realize that God is in control...      even when the modern Judas (fallen Apostles), Caiphas (priest who've forgotten God), Pilate (politicians who do what they think the crowd wants), and the rest of us who like the Apostles are never quite sure if we too might betray Our Lord and ever need to ask "Is it I Lord?"     Jesus told his disciples to expect persecution. "If they do this to the wood when it is green, what will happen when it is dry?" St. Paul told the early disciples to "Walk by faith not by sight."   The Eucharist is the memorial of the Lord's Passion. We should never lose sight of that! Whatever we experience at the Eucharist we should never lose sight that God is in control and we should trust in God more than anything else that irks us. We need to crush our own egos--all of us, priests, musicians, ushers, and the rest.   The Passion of Christ which every celebration of the Eucharist makes present begins in Matthew's Gospel with Jesus announcing it! In Matthew 26, the Apostle tells us that "When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and he Son of man will be delivered up, up to be crucified," (Matthew 26:1-2). The next verse details that "then" the chief priests set into motion their plan to kill Jesus. The evil they intended only could happen, once God allowed it to happen. This is a great mystery but one that applies to every aspect of our lives and is applicable to what we do when we attend Mass.   Some might think that the "novus ordo" or the "new order of the Mass" is the problem. I attended a funeral a few years ago that was conducted by the schismatic SSPX and I encountered as many "liturgical abuses" at that celebration as I have at any Mass I have attended over the course of my life. The priest, a convert stumbled over the Latin prayers, allowed a lay man who clearly was directing the Mass to do parts that are reserved for the priest alone and the same poor taste in music was illustrated throughout.   I have attended an Eastern Catholic liturgy in the past year where the lay women stopped the priest in the middle of the liturgy to screaming that they did not know where he was in the books they were using to follow the liturgy.   Abuses, imperfections in the liturgy are inevitable. Human beings are imperfect. St. Paul even says that we do not know how to pray as we ought but that the Spirit makes up for what is lacking.   The first step to getting the most out of the Eucharist is to accept that God is in control, not me. Whether I am the presider, the cantor, the reader, the congregant it is not about "me" it is about doing what Jesus told his disciples to do. Trust in God!

      My newest book will be available in September.&nbsp; It takes the traditional understanding of "taking up one's cross and following Jesus" and gives it a contemporary application. Filled with real life stories, scripture and ways to be a better follower of Christ this is the perfect way to put into action in your life the saving and life changing message of the Gospel. Consider purchasing a copy not only for yourself but also for your children, pastor, teacher, or whoever you'd like to bring closer to Christ!

      Contrary to the fiction of the Da Vinci Code, the Church reverences Mary Magdalene and today is her day!  From The urlLink Office of Readings :    "When Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and did not find the Lord's body, she thought it had been taken away and so informed the disciples. After they came and saw the tomb, they too believed what Mary had told them. The text then says: The disciples went back home, and it adds: but Mary wept and remained standing outside the tomb.   We should reflect on Mary's attitude and the great love she felt for Christ; for though the disciples had left the tomb, she remained. She was still seeking the one she had not found, and while she sought she wept; burning with the fire of love, she longed for him who she thought had been taken away. And so it happened that the woman who stayed behind to seek Christ was the only one to see him. For perseverance is essential to any good deed, as the voice of truth tells us: Whoever perseveres to the end will be saved. "

They found that most Catholics questioned in a nationwide telephone survey think bishops are covering up the facts about sexual abuse. Older and more active Catholics tended to have more confidence in bishops than did younger Catholics or those less involved in church activities, they reported. Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said the failure of bishops to stop the abuse was a bigger problem than the abuse itself."

      Overcoming judging is my key priority in life.  From  urlLink Zenit News Agency - The World Seen From Rome :    "The temptation to judge others is the greatest obstacle in listening to God, says preacher of the Pontifical Household.   Capuchin Father Raniero Cantalamessa made that comment today in reference to John Paul II's affirmation Sunday, when the Pope said at his Angelus address: 'To listen to the Word of God is the most important thing in our lives.'   Father Cantalamessa told Vatican Radio: 'In addition to the external obstacles imposed by the rhythm of modern life, there is an even more dangerous noise: the one which impedes our hearts from listening to the Word of God when judging others.'   This attitude 'makes us judges who judge the whole world. This silent 'noise' of the heart must be silenced in our minds -- at times even with violence,' he said.   'Enough, enough of this sort of reasoning, of complaints!' the priest said. He said people must tell themselves: 'I want to read the Word of God, I want to listen to the Word of God, I want to repeat within me the Word of God.'   It is an exercise that helps 'to pass from useless, noisy, egoistic thoughts to thoughts that come from God,' he added."

      43% of Democrats identify themselves as pro-life...  From  urlLink Pro-Life Democrats Will Rally Against Abortion at Democratic Convention :    "Though they constitute a sizable minority, pro-life Democrats are often the forgotten element of a Democratic Party increasingly dominated by abortion advocates.   To make their case that the party's extreme pro-abortion stance is alienating voters, members of Democrats for Life of America will conduct a rally at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston.  'This is a homecoming party for the many pro-life democrats who have left our party,' says DFLA executive director Kristen Day. 'We are dedicated Democrats who are tired of standing outside the big tent.'   Members of the pro-life Democratic group will sport buttons with the phrase '43 percent of Democrats can't be wrong.'  That's a reference to a January 2004 Zogby poll that found 43 percent of respondents who call themselves Democrats take a pro-life position opposing most or all abortions."

       Please keep posting your comments in the post for Monday on what "obstacles" you encounter. In this post I'd like to hear what are the ways you find that in spite of the imperfect liturgies you attend, what helps you&nbsp; deal with the imperfection?   &nbsp;  I'd also appreciate it, if you'd react to some of these suggestions in how to deal with the imperfection:  &nbsp;    Give Thanks!  We all know that Eucharist means "thanksgiving."    My attitude in dealing with the imperfections of liturgical ministers, whatever their rank is to often grow angry with their performance. In the process I realize that I'm falling into the trap set by the enemy. I'm in the presence of Christ that is reason enough to give thanks! "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor?" "You'll never wash my feet." "Doesn't this man know what kind of woman this is?" are all statements of discontent leveled at Jesus both by his followers and his enemies--how can I, realizing that the perfection of the Kingdom is only partially revealed here at this Eucharist rise above the foibles of the human agents? I realize by fostering an attitude of thanksgiving.    Take Up Your Cross-- Realize that you have a sacrifice to offer with Christ at the Mass   There are somethings that happen at some Catholic Churches that are wrong even by the Church's own admission. Enduring these abuses are painful to those who are aware that they are abuses. Embrace that pain, see it as part of the sacrifice you are offering with the one sacrifice of Christ at this Mass. Further, take up the cross to educate yourself to find out if in fact what you are experiencing as an abuse, truly is an abuse and if it is to confront the guilty parties face to face.&nbsp; The cross is never a fatalistic approach but one that leads to the victory of resurrection. Expect that your cross will lead to a deeper conversion to trusting in God alone.    Reconciliation-- Some of what bothers us at the Eucharist is due to the division that exist within the Body of Christ.   Jesus told his disciples that if on the way to the Temple they realized that there was some rift that existed between a brother and them to go to the brother and be reconciled first and then go with your brother and offer your sacrifice together. For too long we have allowed the fractured body of Christ to limp in and out of our churches. We&nbsp;need to seek out those who we are irreconciled with and in Christ come together. Ironically this may mean excluding some who refuse to be reconciled to the Church.

      In reading over the many comments from the piece on Bishop D'Arcy's statement was one that I found both interesting and thought provoking. I'm including it here for others to read and to comment on if they'd like.&nbsp; I would add to the comment below that the writer is absolutely right about parish life and heterosexual priests; while seminary life in a mostly male environment may be a little too tempting for&nbsp; a homosexual seminarian, parish life with the large number of women present is just as tempting for a heterosexual priest. &nbsp; Here is the comment of a reader: &nbsp;  As I have often mentioned before, Bishop D'Arcy's view is inconsistent, because it also precludes gay men from going to college if they're going to be living in a dorm, and gay boys from participating in gym class if they're going to have to change in a locker room. It would also preclude gay men from participating in team sports, among other things. Yet the Church has never taught that gay men cannot live in college dorms, participate in gym class or play team sports. So it seems to me that the Church's motivation for preventing gay men from becoming priests is not that it's unfair to them.    &nbsp;  Also, Bishop D'Arcy's assertion that priests should be men who would make good husbands and fathers is absolutely true. However, this should be determined from individual to individual, not just by lumping all heterosexuals into the category of "good husbands and good fathers" and all homosexuals into the category of "not." On the one hand, there are many heterosexuals who would and do make terrible husbands and fathers, and there are many heterosexual priests who have no business being in the priesthood. Conversely, there are many homosexuals who would make good husbands and fathers if they were heterosexual, and there are many good homosexual priests.    &nbsp;  One could argue, by the way, that there are many heterosexual priests who should not be thrust into a parish where they must work with and around women, while also trying to maintain a celibate lifestyle. So this is not just a homosexual issue. There are both heterosexual and homosexual men who should not be priests.

        Note: I want to keep this at the top of my postings so that I can elicit as many comments/emails as possible. New postings may be below this one for that reason.    &nbsp;  I'm soliciting opinions, feelings, anger, whatever about the Eucharist that will be used in a book that will be entitled something like "How to Get the Most Out of the Eucharist." I want to make it "real" so I'm putting it together from the ground up with all the feedback that I hear when I speak about the Mass to a wide variety of groups.  &nbsp;  So I think their are three problem areas, but I'm open to expanding the list based on the feedback that I get here:  &nbsp;     Feelings and Reality :  "I'm bored" "I don't like the pastor (or fill in the blank)" "I don't understand what's going on" "The preaching (or again fill in the blank) sucks" "I'm not being fed" "I don't believe in it" "I'm angry with the way things are done either correctly or incorrectly"    The Wandering Mind : " I'm thinking about something else most of the time" "I find it impossible to concentrate"    &nbsp;Real Abuses :  "We use words that aren't in the Missal" "We shake hands at the beginning and in the middle" "(fill in the blank) "We hold hands during the Our Father" "The role of the priest and the laity is confused by the way the Eucharist is celebrated in our parish"    I would like to say with regard to #3 that sometimes people perceive and abuse where no real abuse is taking place, in defense of priests they sometime inherit a situation where certian things have been taking place in a parish and it is hard to stem the tide. I also think that many of the "abuses" have crept into the liturgy because of the items in #1 and attempts to make the liturgy more exciting or relevant, both huge mistakes.&nbsp;Such&nbsp;errors&nbsp;reveal that one doesn't understand the liturgy enough to know that it is the most amazing, exciting and relevant thing we will ever do in this earthly life!  Please link to this discussion on your blog, inviting your readers to participate in this discussion. Feel free to use the comments or to email me directly.  Thanks! &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Bishop D'Arcy reiterates something he has said in his diocese back home in Boston...  From  urlLink Boston.com / News / Local / Mass. / Bishop urges gay ban in clergy :    "''We must be very careful of who we accept in the seminary and who we ordain as priests,' D'Arcy told parishioners at Our Lady of the Presentation Church, the Brighton parish in which he grew up. ''It's time to ordain men of quality, not to just look for numbers.'  During yesterday's 10 a.m. Mass, D'Arcy, now bishop of the Fort Wayne-South Bend Diocese in Indiana, said the church must look for men whom children can respect -- ''men who would be good husbands, men who would be good fathers,' he said.  In an interview after the service, D'Arcy acknowledged that his reference to ''good husbands . . . good fathers' conveyed his belief that only heterosexual men should be allowed to become priests. He said men in the priesthood must embrace celibacy.  To put a gay man in the priesthood, in a mostly male environment, is unfair, given the potential attractions, D'Arcy said. ''We don't put these [heterosexual] men in with attractive women,' he said, referring to seminarians. ''You're putting him in with men. It's not fair to him, it's not fair to them, it's not fair to the church.'"

      Not just a "bishops" problem, but clearly the laity want to be led by guys picking up guys on the internet. I wonder when he'll be declared "healed" at St. Luke's and sent back to do parish work?  From  urlLink ABC30.com: Farewell Mass For Lastiri :    "St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Merced held a farewell mass Sunday for outgoing Father Jean-Michael Lastiri.  Supporters of the priest are collecting signatures on petitions and hope to present the names of 2,000 supporters to the Fresno Diocese.  The priest is facing allegations of using the internet to solicit sex with men.  Although the priest was not at Sunday's mass, he did leave a statement to the parish vowing he will return.  Supporters hope he'll be forgiven for the alleged misconduct.  Lastiri has been removed from the parish. He is expected to leave the area next week and will then head to a Maryland treatment facility for psychological and spiritual counseling."

       From Pope John Paul at  urlLink Zenit :    &nbsp;  "While Martha is taken up with domestic affairs," the Holy Father said, "Mary is seated at the feet of the Master and listens to his word. Christ affirms that Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her."    &nbsp;  "To listen to the Word of God is the most important thing in our lives," the Pope added.     &nbsp;  "Christ is always in our midst and wants to speak to our hearts," the Holy Father continued.     &nbsp;  "We can listen to him by meditating with faith on sacred Scripture, recollecting ourselves in private and communal prayer, pausing in silence before the tabernacle, from which he speaks to us of his love."     &nbsp;  In this context, John Paul II explained that Sunday is the day that Christians are called especially "to encounter and listen to the Lord." They are given the opportunity in the holy Mass "in which Christ prepares for the faithful the table of the Word and Bread of life," he said.     &nbsp;  "But other moments of prayer and reflection, of rest and fraternity, can usefully contribute to sanctify the day of the Lord," the Pope continued. Moreover, when "by the action of the Holy Spirit, God takes up his dwelling in the heart of the believer, it becomes easier to serve brothers," as "happened in a singular and perfect way in Mary Most Holy," he added.

      From The urlLink Universalis: Office of Readings :    "Christ is both the way and the door. Christ is the staircase and the vehicle, like the throne of mercy over the Ark of the Covenant, and the mystery hidden from the ages. A man should turn his full attention to this throne of mercy, and should gaze at him hanging on the cross, full of faith, hope and charity, devoted, full of wonder and joy, marked by gratitude, and open to praise and jubilation. Then such a man will make with Christ a pasch, that is, a passing-over. Through the branches of the cross he will pass over the Red Sea, leaving Egypt and entering the desert.   There he will taste the hidden manna, and rest with Christ in the sepulchre, as if he were dead to things outside. He will experience, as much as is possible for one who is still living, what was promised to the thief who hung beside Christ: Today you will be with me in paradise.   For this passover to be perfect, we must suspend all the operations of the mind and we must transform the peak of our affections, directing them to God alone. This is a sacred mystical experience. It cannot be comprehended by anyone unless he surrenders himself to it; nor can he surrender himself to it unless he longs for it; nor can he long for it unless the Holy Spirit, whom Christ sent into the world, should come and inflame his innermost soul. Hence the Apostle says that this mystical wisdom is revealed by the Holy Spirit.  If you ask how such things can occur, seek the answer in God?s grace, not in doctrine; in the longing of the will, not in the understanding; in the sighs of prayer, not in research; seek the bridegroom not the teacher; God and not man; darkness not daylight; and look not to the light but rather to the raging fire that carries the soul to God with intense fervour and glowing love. The fir is God, and the furnace is in Jerusalem, fired by Christ"

      Quoted here are the words of Bishop Victor Galeone of the Diocese of Saint Augustine...  From  urlLink The Saint Augustine Catholic Online :   In 1962 Archbishop Joseph Rummel of New Orleans excommunicated Judge Leander Perez for attempting to block the desegregation of the school system in the archdiocese. The mainstream and liberal media applauded the archbishop’s action. Racists and segregationists attacked him vehemently. How dare he try to impose his sectarian views on those who held a different opinion on how the schools should be integrated?   In recent months, several Catholic bishops have issued directives forbidding the Eucharist to Catholic politicians who support abortion-on-demand. The media has been quick to respond with scurrilous editorial cartoons and commentaries, castigating those bishops for breaching the wall between church and state. How dare they try to impose their sectarian morality on the rest of the nation?   How does one respond to these charges? First, one should bear in mind that the right to life is not a sectarian Catholic issue – like celibacy for priests or meatless Fridays during Lent. It is a fundamental moral attribute of our humanity. We possess this right not from the state, not from the church, but from God himself. The founders of our nation acknowledged as much when they declared to the British monarch: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” (emphasis mine)   Second, the right to life is the foundation of all our other rights. Just as a building without a foundation will ultimately collapse, so too, every other right we enjoy will crumble unless buttressed by this most basic right of all. So a politician of whatever or no religious persuasion at all is bound to respect the right to life of others, including incipient life in the womb.    “But the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that one cannot be sure when human life begins.” That assertion was disingenuous on the part of Justice Harry Blackmun. It’s embryology, not theology, that asserts: “Development is a continuum that begins when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm and ends at death. All the genetic information of the human adult is already present in that single combined cell, the zygote, which definitely marks the beginning of a new individual.” All that is needed for development is time and nourishment, the same components needed by a newborn child.    “Can an avid proponent of abortion-on-demand be at the same time a Catholic in good standing with the church?” I answer that question by asking another: Can an avowed racist be a member in good standing of the NAACP? For similar reasons, there are some positions so extreme that they would bar one from being considered a good Catholic, not because a specifically Catholic teaching is being denied, but because a basic tenet of the natural law is being trashed. As members of the human family, we must obey the natural law, written on our hearts: “You shall not take an innocent life.”   “Are you implying that Holy Communion should be denied to Catholic candidates who espouse abortion-on-demand?” I would hope that those candidates who consistently vote in support of abortion have enough integrity to willingly exclude themselves from receiving the Eucharist. After all, they are supporting a procedure for which the church reserves the penalty of excommunication for those directly involved. Besides, consider what St. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11:27: “Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in any unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.”    “What about Catholic politicians who support the death penalty? Shouldn’t they refrain from receiving Holy Communion too?” According to church teaching, the state has the right to protect its citizens from unjust aggressors through use of the death penalty. However, at present the church stresses that non-lethal means – namely life-imprisonment – are more in keeping with human dignity, thus making reasons for recourse to the death penalty almost non-existent. Still, the church does not deny that the state continues to have the right to impose the death penalty. Furthermore, although the life issues are all interrelated, not all of them are of equal importance. In 1998, the bishops of the United States issued Living the Gospel of Life, a pastoral letter that stated categorically that the right to life carried more weight than other issues because it served as their moral foundation.    “I still feel that you bishops are meddling in politics.” Abortion is a moral, not a political issue. The United States Constitution does not prohibit a member of the cloth from addressing moral issues. If it did, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would never have achieved all the good that resulted in the area of civil rights. Besides, would not our silence be similar to that of the German clergy who looked the other way while millions of innocent citizens were being herded off to the ovens? And finally, God’s word roundly condemns anyone who tolerates evil. God commands Samuel to inform Eli that his house will be punished “because although he knew that his sons were blaspheming God, he did not reprove them” (1 Sam 3:13). A very similar message is found in the prophet Ezekiel 33:7-9. The lesson from Scripture is clear: Whoever tolerates evil becomes an accomplice in that evil.

      New bishop of Scranton says he is banned from active ministry.  From  urlLink Times Leader | 07/14/2004 | Suspended or not? Accused ex-local priest's status unclear :    "A former area priest accused of sexual abuse was banned from active ministry, then given the OK to resume that work ... except he wasn't.   Confused? So is the priest's lawyer.  Attorney Greg Magarity says his client, the Rev. Christopher Clay, deserves answers. In 2002, Clay was accused of sexual misconduct and relieved of his duties. But he later received approval to resume active ministry from then-Bishop James Timlin.  Yet according to Diocese of Scranton spokeswoman Maria Orzel, Bishop Joseph Martino, who replaced Timlin last year, still bans Clay from active ministry. On Tuesday, Orzel said the ban is intact because a diocesan investigation is 'ongoing.'"

      From  urlLink Zenit News Agency - The World Seen From Rome:    John Paul II is writing yet another book, this time on philosophical and existential reflections, says an aide.   The process of the writing "is quite advanced," said Father Pawel Ptasznik, head of the Polish section of the Vatican Secretariat of State, in an interview with the Polish Catholic news agency KAI.   Yet, "it is a long process and one must not expect the publication to be imminent," the priest said.   "In regard to the content, I can say that the news, according to which he will address above all the problems of totalitarianism, is not true," Father Ptasznik added.   "It is an open secret that for years Father Jozef Tischner" -- a philosopher and friend of the Pope -- "suggested to the Sovereign Pontiff an interview on philosophical and existential topics," Father Ptasnik said. "If I am not mistaken, this interview took place in the summer of 1984, and it was recorded."

The government blamed the outage on 'mismanagement' of the electricity grid. Still, officials promised the network was ready to handle the Aug. 13-29 Olympics.  But it was yet another hurdle in Athens' attempt to convince the world it is ready to host well-run and safe games. Olympics preparations have come under criticism because of construction delays and concerns over security arrangements to stop terror attacks."

Officials with the local diocese declined to comment but were meeting privately on the scandal, Austrian state television reported.

      What is interesting if you go to the original story is the listing of how many parishioners attend each parish. The diocese has a host of parishes that have under 500 parishioners and not many that have a large amount. What has happened to the Catholic Faith in this part of the country?  From  urlLink toledoblade.com :    "Two dozen of the Toledo Catholic Diocese's 157 parishes are recommended for closure as part of a realignment study designed to consolidate parishes with too few members and assign a dwindling number of priests to no more than two parishes at a time (See Diocesan statistics below).  Bishop Leonard P. Blair will announce the names of parishes involved in the recommended changes in September after a series of meetings with clergy and members of the diocese, church leaders announced yesterday. The bishop will then meet with each affected parish to explain the situation, hear feedback, and announce his final decision on the changes in March, 2005."

But until the comments of the senior administration officials on Thursday, it was not clear that Mr. bin Laden and top deputies like Ayman Zawahiri were responsible for the concern.  Another senior administration official said on Thursday that the intelligence reports - apparently drawn partly from interviews with captured Qaeda members and partly from other intelligence - referred to efforts 'to inflict catastrophic effects' before the election.  This official said that the reports did not refer specifically to Mr. bin Laden's instructions or desires, but did make clear that instructions were coming from Qaeda leaders. 'It sounds like a corporate effort,' the official said."

"I'm surprised it didn't happen earlier," said Father Thomas Reese, editor-in-chief of America, the weekly Catholic magazine published by the Jesuit Society. "Given the judgments, someone had to run out of money. I don't think this is the last diocese."  The Tucson Diocese in Arizona has set a mid-September deadline for deciding whether to file for bankruptcy, and the Boston Archdiocese sold the former archbishop?s residence and surrounding land to raise $90 million to help pay a settlement with sexual-abuse victims.  The Boston Archdiocese is closing schools and parish churches to cut costs because donations and attendance at Mass dropped after revelations of sexual abuse by priests. The Boston Archdiocese's Web site states that the properties will be sold and the proceeds will be shared with remaining parishes and used to support health and pension funds for church employees.  Tucson Bishop Gerald Kicanas has publicly considered Chapter 11 bankruptcy as one way to deal with possible judgments in the cases of more than 20 alleged victims. Lawyers representing people with possible claims have asked the courts to stop the diocese from selling any property before Kicanas decides whether to file for bankruptcy."

From  urlLink Kerry Says He Believes Life Starts at Conception (washingtonpost.com) :    "But even as he tried to avoid making news Sunday, Kerry broke new ground in an interview that ran in the Dubuque, Iowa, Telegraph Herald.

I believe life does begin at conception.'   Spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said that although Kerry has often said abortion should be 'safe, legal and rare,' and that his religion shapes that view, she could not recall him ever publicly discussing when life begins.   'I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist,' he continued in the interview. 'We have separation of church and state in the United States of America.' The comments came on the final day of a three-state Midwest swing, during which Kerry has repeatedly sought to dispel stereotypes that could play negatively among voters there. "

      Bishops and priests among the populace there...  The priest serves in the Diocese of Saint Augustine, and I know him but never knew of this event in his life...  From  urlLink Spirit Daily :   That, asserts Father Maniyangat, was when hell, an awful sight, opened before him. It was daunting. "I saw Satan and people fighting, tortured, and screaming," claims the cleric. "And the fire too. I saw fire. I saw people suffering and the angel told me it was due to mortal sin and the fact that they were not repentant. That was the thing. Unrepentant."  The priest says he was told there are seven "degrees" or levels of suffering in the netherworld. Those who committed "mortal sin after mortal sin" in life were suffering the most intense heat. "They had bodies and looked very ugly, so cruel and ugly, horrifying," says Father Maniyangat. "They were human but like monsters: fearful, ugly-looking things. I saw people I knew but I can't say who they were. The angel told me I could not reveal this."  The sins that got them into that state, he says, were transgressions such as abortion, homosexuality, hatefulness, and sacrilege. If they had repented, they would have gone to purgatory -- the angel allegedly told him. He was surprised at who he saw in hell. Some were priests. Some were bishops. "There were many, because they had misled the people," he asserts -- again, for your discernment. "They were people I never expected."

      "Worthy to Receive the Lamb"  From the  urlLink Archdiocese of Atlanta site :   As bishops, we have the obligation to teach and guide the Catholic Faithful whom we shepherd in the Body of Christ. A fundamental teaching of our Church is respect for the sacred gift of life. This teaching flows from the Natural Law and from Divine Revelation.  Life is a gift bestowed upon us by God, a truth underscored by the commandment: "You shall not kill" (Deut 5: 17 ). The Old Testament also teaches us that human life in the womb is precious to God: "...I formed you in the womb..." (Jer 1: 5). The right to life is a value "which no individual, no majority and no State can ever create, modify or destroy, but must only acknowledge, respect and promote" (Pope John Paul II, Evangelium vitae, 71a). A law, therefore, which legitimizes the direct killing of innocent human beings through abortion is intrinsically unjust, since it is directly opposed to the natural law, to God's revealed commandments, and to the consequent right of every individual to possess life, from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.  Catholics in political life have the responsibility to exemplify in their public service this teaching of the Church, and to work for the protection of all innocent life. There can be no contradiction between the values bestowed by Baptism and the Catholic Faith, and the public expression of those values. Catholic public officials who consistently support abortion on demand are cooperating with evil in a public manner. By supporting pro-abortion legislation they participate in manifest grave sin, a condition which excludes them from admission to Holy Communion as long as they persist in the pro-abortion stance (cf. Canon 915).

      From  urlLink In Spite of It All, St. Christopher Hangs In There :    "For young believers, the dichotomy between the historical man and his legend is neatly explained in a children's book, 'Loyola Kids Book of Saints,' which is sold in the cathedral gift shop.  In it, author Amy Wellborn writes, 'We don't know much about Christopher... but the stories we tell most often about Christopher [are] stories we've invented to help us figure out the best ways to serve God.'

      From  urlLink ThisisLondon :    "Hundreds of people were left to die inside a blazing supermarket after security staff locked doors to prevent customers from running out without paying, it emerged today.   Initial reports suggested as many as 340 people were killed when the fire tore through a large shopping centre in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion after an industrial propane tank exploded.   Police have charged the store's owner Juan Pio Paiva and his son Daniel with homicide after they allegedly ordered security personnel to lock down every exit. Firefighters had to batter down the locked main entrance to the complex before they could reach hundreds of trapped shoppers. "

      From  urlLink wnbc.com - News - Holland Tunnel Closed To Inbound Truck Traffic :    "The Holland Tunnel closed to commercial traffic heading to New York at 12:01 a.m. Monday, officials said Sunday evening.  The ban was "correlated to the warning about the downtown financial districts," said Tony Ciavolella, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  He said commercial vehicles should use the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge as alternative routes. The ban would definitely affect trucks, said Ciavolella, but it was not immediately clear whether commercial vans would be prohibited.   The ban was not slated to affect vehicles leaving New York City. No ending date for the ban was set."

      From  urlLink The Australian: Goward supports Pope on women [August 02, 2004] :    "Pope John Paul II won unexpected praise from Australia's leading feminist bureaucrat yesterday, when Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward branded the new papal document on women 'a small step forward for man but a great step forward for womankind'.  The Vatican document celebrates sexual difference, attacks extreme feminism for promoting a conflict between the sexes and calls for 'a just valuing of the work of women within the family', so that mothers who work don't have to choose to 'relinquish their family life'. 'What I think the Pope is recognising is that if we don't help women to work and have children we are going to see a continuation of the decline in the fertility rate and in the happiness of women,' Ms Goward told Sky News.   'When the Pope says let's get on with it and support women in both those roles, I think the game's over.'   An advocate of paid maternity leave, Ms Goward said the papal document - a Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World - could even help reverse the falling birthrate.   'We love being different and we love having children,' Ms Goward said. "

      Over the Vatican Letter (see below)...  From  urlLink Top News Article | Reuters.com :    "'This letter could easily have been written by an imam of al-Azhar,' she said referring to Sunni Islam's most respected institution of religious learning in Cairo.   'To be fair to the Catholic Church, no religion is a great friend of women,' she told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. 'They pay you a lot of compliments but when push comes to shove they ask you to stay in your place: wife, nurse, mother and grandmother.' "
