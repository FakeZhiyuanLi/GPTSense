      What's wrong with the youth of America?  Today I found out that one of my students has been habitually stomping on the feet of another one of my students while waiting in line to go to the daycare.  Why?  Because the girl is new and happens to have the same make and color of Converse All-stars as she does.  This is very disturbing to me.  I've heard of crimes of fashion before, but not at the age of 8 years old!  I guess stomping on the girls' feet was the least she could do.  She could have chosen the route that a classmate of hers chose the day before: writing a note that said, "YOU WILL DIE TOMORROW" to a classmate because she was annoying him during silent reading time.  Such anger from young children is disillusioning and sad.....not to mention scary.  I have been putting off wearing a certain pair of sketchers that I have because they look very similar to a pair i noticed on a kid in my class....  ...you know what they say, don't look a gift horse in the mouth...

      Allow me to set the scene: You're sitting in Whataburger having a perfectly ridiculous conversation when it strikes you that it would be funny to terrorize the mindless banter with a bit of the ol'  confuse everyone at the table    routine.  Try this: in those all-too-familiar conversatons where it would be appropriate, if not predictably painful, for someone to use a cliche, try using the wrong one for the situation.  For example:      someone says, "man, it's really pouring outside!" (instead of following with some silly remark about it raining cats and dogs"     you say, "well you know what they say?-- what's good for the goose is good for the gander!"  Ok, I admit it sounds equally stupid, but try coming up with the wrong cliche at the right time, it's not easy!  here is a running list of cliches: (contributions are encouraged)      beat around the bush   blind as a bat   birds of a feather   cool as a cucumber   cool, calm, and collected   crystal clear   diamond in the rough   easy as pie   few and far between    hit the spot   hook line and sinker   in no uncertain terms   last but not least   like a bull in a china shop   raining cats and dogs   selling like hotcakes   the bottom line   the last straw     two wrongs don't make a right   a penny saved is a penny earned   the straw that broke the camal's back   like finding a needle in a haystack   crying over spilt milk   when the going gets tough, the tough get going   better than sliced bread   madder than a wet hen   fit to be tied   The writing's on the wall    what goes around, comes around...whats meant to be will be....good things come to those who wait...

      I think I've changed the colors on my blog about six times already.  Of course anyone reading this would have no idea.  I think mainly I just like trying to find which of the many random lines and numbers in the html code have any bearing on what I'm actually trying to change.  My blog is still young.  Having not been exposed to other blogs, my blog has no basis for comparison.  It feels no shame, like Adam and Eve in their secret garden, completely oblivious to the fact that they are completely and utterly naked.  I expect that my blog will go through some sort of awakening once it has realized the simplicity of it's innocence.  But until then, shhhhh....

      This is my first post as Mr. fredo!  I'm not quite sure what possessed me to start a blog seeing as I've never kept a journal before.  Prediction: I get very obsessive about this blog and spend way too much time on it.  Let the experiment begin...

      So, I'm 23 now.  Yeah.  Exciting news.  Honestly, age hasn't even been something that I've been aware of since 21.  Except of course when my students ask me how old I am and I insist that I am 82 years young. (Extreme Make Over can do wonders)  You know, I was going to go on writing about how amazingly unexciting it has been turning 23, but I'll spare you the reading.  Honestly, the night of my birthday was very similar to my 21st birthday in that they both ended with me wondering why drunk people have such little shame in hugging a toilet.  Sad.  I guess a part of me was hoping I could relive the glory days of college when getting drunk every weekend was not noteworthy.  Well, now that that's over with I can go back to being 23.  I feel like this blog might be headed for a change of tone.  I'm moving back in with my parents on thursday and though this is not exciting for me, the biggest annoyance on my mind has nothing to do with my parents and everything to do with the fact that I'm going to have to deal with carpeted floors.  I've had hardwoods for the last 5 years and I guess I just find them superior.  I can't put my finger on why I can't stand carpet, but I know that I will have plenty of time to gather my thoughts about it.  I hope this blog doesn't turn into some pathetic sob story of another nostalgic college kid forced to live in the all-so-terrible suburbs.  Then again, maybe that would at least give me something to write about.

      People/(car) watching: location: Diedrich's Coffee: Westheimer @ Hazard   What exactly is the point of the car bra?  Are they meant to support those with busty bumpers?  Are other cars turned on by them, imagining what they would look like without them?  Was that the theme from Tetris that I just heard blasting from that car at the stop light?  What is the appeal inherent in pealing out during acceleration?  Is the new model VW Beetle really a unisex car?  And why have I seen 5 of them drive past me in the last 5 minutes? (the first one was wearing a bra)  Why must motorcycles be so stinkin' loud?  I just saw a '70s model VW Bug the exact same color as my old "Lerlene".  Who are the people buying H2 Hummers?...other than Roger Clemens?  Besides, the original military-industrial Hummer was way more boss than it's chromed, streamlined evil cousin.  I don't think I'll ever be able to watch people try to open the inoperable faux side door to Diedrich's without laughing.  There's just something sexy about a woman wearing a flowing white skirt.  That's all for now.

       "I ain't too good at conversation, girl, So you might not know exactly how I feel, But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl, And build you a house made out of stainless steel. But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting That's hanging in the Louvre, My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches But I know that I can't move."            ~Bob Dylan  A break from the usual banter-- here's to all my missed opportunities.

      Well, my life as an internet junkie has reached a new phase in its evolution.  This morning I awoke to the terrible sound of cables being unscrewed and the door slamming behind as my cable box and cable modem connection went on that happy trail to cable heaven.  It felt a little bit like that unconsciously sad feeling one might get from knowing that an old pet had reached the end of life as it had known and was about to be taken to the pound.  My roommate warned me that this day would come, but I don't think I was fully prepared for the withdrawal.  Normally after work I would look forward to coming home, firing up the 'puter, turning on the TV and settling in for the evening.  But today it hit me on my drive home that there was nothing worth coming home to-- just a pile of unfolded laundry and a castrated entertainment center.  So what did I do?  Like any victim of addiction I went for the immediate fix--I stopped off at the local coffee shop for a wi-fi quickie.  Here I am, in the middle of my own technological relaxation therapy, wondering how I'm ever going to make it from day to day without the comforts I took for granted these last 9 months.  Nine months...its like I'm suffering from postpartum depression.  Well, maybe not quite like that.  Maybe I should just stop trying to compare the loss of my cable modem to something and try harder at getting a life...

       urlLink    I think this guy's kid is in my class.  At the beginning of the year he was very upset over my use of playing cards in math games.  Today I think I saw him arguing with the PE teacher during Field Day, claiming that his kid had been cheated out of a win in a game of H-O-R-S-E.

      I think there's a band of nocturnal cockroaches living in my kitchen.  I first noticed a roach in my kitchen a month or so ago.  I made an attempt to send it back to it's maker, but was left in disappointment.  At random intervals I would see the roach in my kitchen, always late at night, never during the day.  He must have been a scout, checking out the potential for danger and finding me to be less than threatening as he scampered under the stove every time I would make my move.  I called him a scout, but really he was more of an empressario, bringing in more roaches to settle in their own manifest destiny west of the garage.  Last night, as I'm getting some water before I go to sleep I see one, then another, and then another roach meandering through the obstacle course that is my kitchen counter.  Over the scrubbing pad, under the blender, and through the gap between the toaster and the wall, these roaches raced their way around to avoid the heel of my shoe held in hand.  At one point, one of them ran and sat on top of one of the Raid Roach Killers in the corner of the counter to keep from being squished-- as if to mock my futile attempts to at exterminating them through dietary temptations.  At the end of the first inning: Roaches: 2, Freddie: 1 (I'm assuming this will prove to be one of many episodes in the epic battle for kitchen dominance)  1 out of 3 roaches downed.  Somewhere my personal statistician is taking note of my .333 RKA (Roach Killing Average)  *incidentally, I just killed a spider in my living room.  Divide and conquer!  Hopefully the arachnid and roach empires wont join forces.

      Reason for absence: Personal illness  That's what the online substitute form asked.  What business is it of theirs?  I'm not going to work today, do I need to explain myself to the internet as well?  So yesterday I felt like I was in a TV sitcom.  My morning started out with a swollen hand all puffy from a bug bite the night before.  I now know what my hands would look like if I gained 100 lbs.  I searched everywhere for my insurance card so I could go to a doctor.  I couldn't find it, more on this later...  There are days when I love my job; yesterday was not one of them.  It was a day where I wanted to be the one throwing the temper-tantrum, talking back, not doing any work, and generally just watching as the class revolved around me.  But nope, my kids beat me to it.  Not only was the giant fly swatter connected to my right arm still radiating, but my throat had swollen up and my voice was at half volume all day.  I had my parent apology letter that I would have to write already written in my mind for after I spanked every last one of those 9yr old brats.           "Dear parents,             I'd like to apologize for spanking some respect for human decency into your ungrateful offspring.  In the future I hope we can avoid this situation with better child-rearing.         sincerely,         Mr. D"  After school I went to a minor emergency clinic and was confronted with the magic clipboard of neverending forms.  On one of them it asked at the top whether or not I was there for an emergency.  I thought, hmm, well it doesn't hurt that much, and I'm not going to die from a swollen hand and throat.  I'm sure there are bigger ailments that would be better to call emergencies.  I don't want to look like a wussie to the 75 year old walking ash tray behind the counter.  But wait, why the hell would I be at a 'Minor Emergency' clinic if it wasn't an emergency?  If I don't mark "yes" will they make me wait even longer?  Do they think I just walked in to watch the big TV mounted to the wall?  You're damn right I'm here for an emergency!  So I go through the whole routine: step on the scale, blood pressure count, "are you allergic to anything?", then I go into waiting room number two.  Fortunately the doctor didn't make me wait around too long.  He talked to me, looked inside practically every opening, spouted out some prescriptions he was going to give me, and then left.  Suddenly the 75 year old ash tray walks in with a syringe and nonchalantly declares, "it's goin' in the booty."  huh?  "it's goin' in the booty!"  does it matter which side?  "well I wrote it down for the right side, so that's what it's gonna be."  There's something rather surreal about exposing your butt cheek to an old nurse.  So I'm going home trying to decide whether to go to Kroger or Walgreens from my prescription.  I choose Walgreens, only because the Kroger by my house looks so crummy that I couldn't imagine it having something as clean as a pharmacy in it.  Walgreens makes me wait an hour for my drugs, so I go to Kroger to get some groceries; it goes without saying, they had a pharmacy.  Anyway, when I get back to pick up my prescription the assistant at the counter can't find my bag because the stupid pharmacist who took my prescription wrote down my name as Freddie Disheesh.  I kinda like that now that I look at it again.  Makes me sound foreign.  Anyhoo, then the assistant says she can't get my insurance to come up, so she's on the phone for 10 minutes with them and they pull up every family member I have except me.  So I have to pay for the blasted drugs myself.  Looking at my prescriptions, I realize they want me to take 6 pills right at once.  Funny, if I were planning on ODing on drugs, 6 would sound like a good amount to pop at one time.  So anyway, I'm still alive today, so my mouthful of pills must have done something to quell my "minor emergency".  Now I just get to sit back and enjoy playing hooky for the day.

      "Lately, my most spontaneous, impulsive decisions involve whether or not to just go to the Astro's baseball games as opposed to sitting on my ass in front of the tv every night watching them.  I think there is a general opinion that baseball is a slow and tedious sport with a low frequency of excitement.  I am not in complete disagreement with this view since it seems to be reflective of my current lifestyle, which is probably why I find myself drawn to it.  An added bonus is baseball's meticulous attention to pointless statistics.  It's sad when I am impressed with someone's .455 batting average with bases loaded in the 7th inning or later against left-handed pitching in their home stadium.  I find myself wondering if there is some secret person somewhere compiling pointless statistics on me-- freddie is 1 for 9 in his last ten attempts at washing his dishes after eating when it is 10pm or later on a weekday."  *this was extracted from an email I recently wrote*

      wow, it's been a while since my last post.  I've been doing a bit of traveling, so the internet hasn't been the source of most of my interest lately.  Also, I think I need to go back to making more frequent and random posts and stop trying to make each one something new and profound.  On that note...  tonight, I got served!  Yeah, that's right, I actually used that rather lame ass bit of dance cliche, but so what!  It works for what I wanted.  Tonight I had a blast doing one of my most favorite things, people-watching.  I was at this bar/club at the hotel in Poughkeepsie, NY where my family is staying.  We were all sitting around having a few drinks, the dj was playing some painfully mediocre music, and no one was dancing.  Some people eventually made it onto the floor, but very few.  Unsuspectingly, this guy walks into the place and starts circling the dance floor a bit, just checkin things out I guess.  He's dressed in your typical nerd attire: polo-style shirt tucked into black jeans with bleach-white tennis shoes.  All of a sudden he bursts into his act.  This guy was amazing....amazingly shameless.  He danced like a "Saturday Night" Travolta, MC Hammer, and Steve Urkel all rolled into one.  A site that has burned a permanent imprint on my mind, no doubt.  This guy had stamina too, he never quit.  It was an unending symphony of rhythmic gyrations.  Quite the production, really.  Come to find out, the guy is a regular around the bar, but isn't exactly running on all cylinders (ifyaknowwhatimean).  Anyway, I'm sure I'm going straight to Hell for having a few laughs at his expense, but at least I'll have company, b/c there wasn't a person in there that wasn't enjoying the show.  I guess if there's anything to be learned from him it's that dancing is not for the shameful and timid.  Always dance like nobody's watching (even if everyone is watching and laughing there asses off)  p.s. Much more has been going on, but I'll just have to get to it later.  And if you don't like it, then you can just cram it up your cram-hole!  (just kidding, only not really)  p.p.s. Go see Dodgeball, then reread the p.s.

      "...end is the only part of the word that I heard."  Let's be honest, this post can't possibly be for me, because even my parents know that I'm not seeing anyone and haven't for a while now.  I say this about my parents because they are quite literally the last ones to find out about any of my social happenings.  We have an unspoken "don't ask, don't tell" policy about the topic of lady-friends, and for no good reason that I can think of really.  It's been somewhat of a social information standoff since high school.  Occasionally they will send out some scouts to check for hostility, but they usually go back with nothing to report, or they are captured, tortured, and released with only "I'm fine, Mom" to bring back to the Parental Intelligence Agency (PIA).  As implied, this post is dedicated to a friend of mine whose recent breakup has claimed some amount of my daily time and thought.  My advice and support I gladly give as part of my lifelong payment into my own Emotional Support Insurance (ESI).  No one intends on needing ESI (much like auto or life insurance), and usually finds the payments to be taxing and somewhat futile, but the day you find yourself in an emotional accident is the day all your tear-stained shirt sleeves and cellphone-induced ear tumors start working for you.  Hopefully, after this friend's breakup I will have met my deductible and be eligible to receive ESI benefits myself.  Of course, as with any insurance, excessive risk can cause the rates to skyrocket.  An overly fragile, and emotionally risky, friend might need to throw in some free dinners or favors to avoid having their account frozen or coverage terminated.  That's why I plan on making all of my payments early so that when the shit really hits the fan I'll be covered.  As an introductory gift after opening an account with ESI I was thinking of making a CD that one could use in case of emergency.  The CD would have a mixture of socially optimistic titles, melo-contemplative themes, and anger-releasing/relating subject matter.  This CD is in the works, and any contributions to my playlist are welcome and encouraged.  Please add contributions to this post, or email me.

      So I finished the book I was reading last night around 6 a.m. and before I start on one of the three new books I bought today I want to record my feelings about this book before it slips away into the abyss that is my memory.  I have read not a ton, but plenty of books in my life as a literate being, but my memories of these books always seem dim.  Either that or I just didn't understand what I was reading.  I mean honestly, what kind of thirteen year-old is going to fully comprehend Orwell's  Animal Farm , or anything by Steinbeck for that matter.  Now I have to go back and reread some of those school time classics just to make sure I actually get the point.  So anyway, in  Skinny Legs and All  you have a story centered around the topic of Jerusalem and all the historical and contemporary conflicts/arguments surrounding it.  The plot is set mostly in NYC and involves the life of a young struggling artist working as a waitress in a restaurant jointly owned by a Jew and an Arab.  The story goes back and forth between the life of the waitress and a band of inanimate objects that are somehow able to talk to each other and move around.  It's pretty ridiculous really, but following the plights of a silver dessert spoon, an old can of pork-and-beans, and a dirty sock actually give rather odd/insightful perspectives of the thinkings and actions of humans.  Anyhoo, the author manages to tie together both plots by interweaving various cultural and religious groups with a high degree of humor, action, and tension.  The title of the book is a reference to a sixteen yr-old belly dancer who is supposedly capable of dropping (literally) the symbolic veils of disillusion that cloud our perception of reality.  I found the read very enjoyable because of the descriptive metaphors and humorous play on words and situations.  I also was happy to get a bit of a history lesson (or at least the author's take) on the old testament, Jerusalem, and the opposing claims of the Israelis and the Palestinians.  The story has serious undertones but is fun, witty, and not full of overly complicated characters.  I've read two books by Tom Robbins now and I must say that I really find his style of writing more enjoyable than any other author I've encountered.  It's got a bit of adventure and fantasy to it while also being intellectual and thought-provoking.  I definitely recommend.

      On the suggestion of a fellow blogger I took the  urlLink Myers-Briggs  personality test.  I've always considered myself a balanced individual, but part of me was hoping the scales might tip towards something amusingly fanatic.  No such luck.  ENTP  Extremely Nerdy Trombone Player?  or  Extroverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving  I should add that they give percentages for each category so that you can see where you fall on the spectrum.  My suspisions about my fence sitting personality were confirmed when I saw that all four categories were only within 10% of going the other way.  However, I've taken the test twice now on separate days and the results were approximately the same.  Want to know what it's like to be an ENTP?  Or how to communicate with one?  And for the ladies out there, how to love one?   urlLink check this out   If only it was as simple as finding your compatible Myers-Briggs partner.  I could wear a shirt that said, "Kiss me, I'm an ENTP"  Alas, I'll just have to play hit-n-miss like everyone else.  Maybe I'll throw subtle hints, like spelling the letters with my food at dinner on a date, or there's always the inconspicuous lettering around the brim of my boxers.  Finally an excuse to wear my pants down past my ass...

      It's gone on long enough.  I thought it was just me being weird, but I think it's something more than that.  We've ignored each other's inequities for years now, but I think it's finally time to come to terms.  It's time to have a heart-to-heart with my wardrobe.  I'm drawing a line in the sand.  Any garment choosing to stand with me is choosing....wait wait wait.  There is no choice here.  It's more of a case of the cool kids picking teams for kickball.  The size of the team is only limited by the number of other cool or useful kids to choose from.  So I better get out my fine tooth comb, a black trashbag labeled with "Goodwill", and a tissue box, because it's not going to be pretty.  I wont miss the impulsive nonsense purchases, but the steadfast shirts that have somehow managed to make it into the new millenium will have to hope they still have some of that 90's charm to them.  What will be funny is to see how many second hand shirts make the cut.  What do you call second hand clothing that you are giving away?  Sustainable clothing?  Born-again clothing?  Third hand clothing?  Bastard clothing?  Red-headed Step-clothing?

      Who the hell came up with the idea of having a bathroom attendant?&nbsp; Who would honestly want to do this job?&nbsp; It must have come from the elementary schools-- teachers constantly yelling into the bathrooms, threatening to go in.&nbsp; That must be it.&nbsp; We lost all credibility as children, and now we must deal with the consequences as adults.  &nbsp;  I don't think I'll ever understand it.&nbsp; I was doing fine on my own.&nbsp; Water, soap, towel-- it's not that difficult.&nbsp; But every once in a while I run into "the little old man who lived by the sink."&nbsp; It actually makes me angry to have him in there.&nbsp; I mean, let's be honest, guys have no trouble urinating pretty much anywhere: in the toilet, in the urinal, in the trough, on the wall, on the tree, in the bushes, in the shower, in a bottle, and when you're a kid, in the bed.&nbsp; But for some reason I just don't like having someone whose job it is to watch and wait for me to do my business, call me crazy.  &nbsp;  The bathroom attendant is a lot like a magician.&nbsp; It's time for you to wash your hands so you turn towards the sinks, make sure your fly isn't open, straighten your pants, do the maintenance tucking and adjusting, reach for the faucet....but wait, the faucet is already on, and there's soap in my hand already!&nbsp; This man has performed magic.&nbsp; The water is on and the soap is in&nbsp;my hand before&nbsp;I even knew&nbsp;I was&nbsp;ready for it.&nbsp;  How did he do it? &nbsp; There is a mirror there, perhaps it was an illusion or trick of the eye.&nbsp; As you walk out holding a paper towel with a puzzled look on your face you have no choice but to leave the bathroom a defeated and swindled man.  &nbsp;  In the words of George W. Bush, "fool me once.....shame on you,....fool me again......"&nbsp; well, whatever, I wont be fooled the next time.&nbsp; The second trip to the bathroom will happen when the elements are in my favor.&nbsp; I will wait to go in when there are other men going in as well.&nbsp; I will take my time at my business and wait for someone else to be snared by the fancy colognes and magic tricks first.&nbsp; Then I will make my move!&nbsp; I dart for an open sink and laugh to myself as the bathroom attendant is helpless to stop me.&nbsp; Turning on a faucet and mashing in the soap dispenser never felt so satisfying.&nbsp; I can leave the bathroom with my head held high and my wallet left in tact.  &nbsp;  These are the battles we must face every time we enter the bathroom.&nbsp; If something goes wrong, no one will be there to save us.&nbsp; We know we must be strong, because no matter what happens  we're on our own .  &nbsp;  My parting question asks whether or not there is a bathroom attendant in the women's room also?&nbsp; Or is it assumed that only men are so incompetent as to need supervision?

      "Keep this land grand."  And what a grand land it is.  As I drove over the Red River into the land of the Okies I knew grand things were in store for me.  OK, OK, let's be honest, when I drove over the Red River I wasn't paying any attention and had no idea I was leaving Texas and entering Oklahoma.  Why?  Because Oklahoma isn't even nice enough to have a 'Welcome to Oklahoma!" sign or anything.  At least there wasn't one on I-35.  It's all good though, I made my peace with Oklahoma when my friend took me to this place called Cattleman's Steakhouse and I had one of the best pieces of cow I've ever had.  The food was good, no doubt, but it did make me feel a little weird when we walked back to the parking lot and I saw the giant sign announcing the entrance to the stockyards.  It's a bit like building a funeral home next to an old folks home-- insensitive, yet efficient.  The reason for my 7 hour drive from Houston to Oklahoma City was to visit and stay with a buddy from WashU.  Johnny "Hotlunch" and I sat next to each other in studio for all of our senior year, and it's only fair to attribute many of my fonder memories of studio to this fact.  The best thing about my visit was that it felt like old times and I was perfectly happy just chillin out.  Aside from a few attractions, we mostly just hung around, smoked some doobie, and watched movies.  It was quite relaxing.  Even though I assured him that we needn't visit anything, he felt like we should go out and do something anyway.  Our first visit was to the Museum of Natural History on the OU campus.  The building wasn't anything special to look at, but there was some pretty neat stuff inside.  I enjoyed the dinosaur fossils and the native american artifacts, of which they had a pretty nice collection.  It was funny though because unlike many museums where the workers will stand around and just make sure you don't touch anything, the workers here liked to sidle up next to you and just start jawin' on about whatever it was that you were looking at.  We would be standing in front of some arrow heads and out of nowhere this old man starts telling us about all the different shapes and sizes and how they might have been used.  It was actually fairly informative and interesting, but it kinda startled me on more than one occasion.  The other site we visited was the Federal Building Memorial.  I had seen pictures of it, but it was all together different to be in the space.  Overall I felt that the site had been treated with tasteful respect and had a powerful quality to it.  The only thing that surprised me was seeing the people that treated it more like an attraction than a memorial.  Of course there will always be the camera happy typical vacationing family that will all want to stand in front of the bookend walls of the monument and say "cheese", but it was a first for me to actually see a wedding party taking their pictures at a memorial.  On the whole many people were able to make a quiet, contemplative tour of the grounds and think about the gravity of the events involved.  After walking the site we decided to take a short walk over to the "new" federal building which was only a block away.  The building had a very heavy feeling to it and was sure to have plenty of setback from the street to the building.  It was interesting to see a government building with a contemporary design to it.  The building was a large rectangle with an equally large open space adjacent to it, only it had an ellipse shape in plan that cut through the open space and the building.  Not really all that interesting of a building, which was evident by the complete lack of people or any signs of life around the it, but I guess most people don't take too much notice of buildings these days except for nerdy architecture students.  So, after visiting a few keystones of Oklahoma City, as well as drinking beer and having a few laughs with a good friend, it was time to head on home.  Most people would not have driven 7 hours just to spend a day with a friend, especially if that friend lives in Oklahoma, but I'm glad to say that I am not "most people" and a day with a good friend is worth more than spending the month doing nothing.

      Ok, so I'm back from my NY excursion and I've had several things running through my head in these days since I've been back.  I think rather than focusing on one right now it would be better just to get them all out before they fade into the abyss that is my memory.  In no particular order...  1. Dramamine has become my new travel buddy.  No more turning green from near sudden losses of cabin pressure on airplanes. (which is probably more often caused by the pilot spilling coffee on himself than some random gale force wind at 35,000 ft)  Now I can pop a pill before I get on the plane and wake up in time to hear the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign go off and make that ever important declaration of urgency by standing up before the people in the rows behind me.  2. I went to the apt of a friend of a friend's while I was in the city and was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a swing.  That's right, a real swing made from a wooden board hung from two lengths of rope.  There were actually two swings side by side.  It was one of those economy apts where there's only really one room.  The place didn't have the traditional couches, coffee table, and TV, but instead left the bulk of the room to open space for the swings.  As an architect, but more importantly as a human being, I think having a swing in my living space is definitely an idea I'm going to steal.  3. I went to NYC with no travel destinations or tourist intentions in mind.  I had two days to see whatever I wanted in the city.  The first day I spent wandering aimlessly through the streets of Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy, the financial district, and Times Square.  I had no real destination, I just kept walking, stopping in the occasional store.  After a while I started getting kinda tired of walking and the heat started getting to me, so I decided that I would chill out somewhere.  The most logical place  at the time was the top of the Empire State Building.  I had been up there before, so it wasn't really a tourist-like experience for me, but I just figured that the best place to catch a breeze in the middle of the city would be 82 floors in the sky.  I was right.  Some might find spending $12 and 45 min. of waiting in line just to "catch a breeze" kinda silly, but in my mind at the time it was well worth it.  4. The second day in the city I decided not to walk around at all-- mostly out of consideration for my blistering feet.  Instead I decided to go to Central Park and read a book.  I got off at 72nd St. and Central Park West, walked about 2 minutes in, found a good sittin' tree and parked it.  I only read about 10 pages before I made a change of plans and decided to take a nap in the grass under the tree.  Trees look pretty cool when you stare straight up into them from next to the trunk.  The best part was that a path went adjacent to where I was sleeping, so I was able to catch about 5 seconds of every conversation that went by.  My favorite must have been the woman speaking to a man about how she always imagined Central Park to be "this big, flat area with just grass."  What made it my favorite was the guy's response: "yeah, me too."  Sheesh, he must have either not been listening at all, been listening and was honestly just as stupid as the woman he was walking with, or been listening and thinking "damn she's stupid, but if I play my cards right I might get to see her bedroom and ride these 'swings' that she keeps mentioning."  5. Lastly, it must be said that no visit to Central Park is complete until you've sat on a park bench and philosophized "the meaning of it all" with some old dude who comes to that same place and has similar conversations probably every day.  There is plenty of reflection to be shared from my conversation with him, but I think I'll leave that for another time.  Thanks to  urlLink Fembot Anne  for her flattering comments.  I hope your ponderings have brought you closer to an understanding of the mysteries of the song of the motorcycle.  I leave you with this: if there really is some sort of sexual symbolism involved in the appeal of the motorcycle, then what makes someone buy a Vespa?
