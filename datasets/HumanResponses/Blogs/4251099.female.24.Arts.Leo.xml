      Coping  Feeling it when it needs to be felt and holding it down when it doesn't. Catching my breathe to starve my brain of the oxygen it needs to overwhelm me. Breathing into the pain in order to bear it.  Written 8/22/04

      Today is Monday. My sister/boss comes back to the office on Wednesday...  The tension in the room in palpable. Her absence weighs down with the promise of discomfort and avoidance to come.  I've been trying to look for another job. I put together an admin resume. Time to put it out...  I'm exhausted, sunburned and full of anxious anticipation...  On Friday I had my individual session with my therapist. He said that what he was most shocked by was her complete lack of empathy:   Empathy: 1. Identification with and understanding of another's situation, feelings, and motives. 2. The attribution of one's own feelings to an object.   Could that be it? Could all of our miscommunication stem from her absolute lack of empathy? I guess it would make sense. I'm one of the most empathic people I know so it would make sense that I would be so discomforted when in a relationship that is lacking in it.  Could her "directness" come off and "cruel" when devoid of empathy?  I'm tired of trying to understand her. To understand, for me, is to forgive. I'm done forgiving... for right now anyway...

      And this is the poem that came out of it all...  The Edge of Estrangement  Letting me in and shoving me back- denying my importance so not to care when the string finally snaps back and I am no longer a part of you.  Playing the world by your own rules and disqualifying dissent as a personal foul.  If we were lovers I would break away for self-preservation, but we chose to bind ourselves together as sisters;  and I forgive every offense in the name of family;  and I want to hold my family close when they push away;  but I am battered and bruised, exhausted as Sisyphus, and the ties that bring me back are wearing thin.

      The session was what it was, I guess. I don't even know what to say or feel about all this...  I know that I feel crazy when I talk to her. It's like everything I feel is a distortion of the truth. Why do I let myself believe that she may be right, when it means that everything I believe is preposterous and irrational? She said that she thought the problem was that we are spending too much time together. My mother had the same insight. My response to my mother was that if you were dumping toxic waste, but just a little at a time and only every once in awhile, it is still a problem despite it's moderation and infrequency.  I don't want to swallow my discontent and play as if everything is ok, but she has a son, my nephew, and if I walk away then I become the first person that leaves him. I know all of us have felt abandoned by at least one person in our lives (if you don’t think you have, then count your blessings or come out of denial) and I don’t want to be that person to him.  At the end of the session she said that she thought I wanted a third party present to say, "Emily, you're right and she's wrong". I agreed with her. I am so desperate to be proved correct and have my experience and perceptions to be firmly supported. If they are not, then I can't trust anything I have come to know about myself. My entire sense of self-awareness (which is pretty strong, mind you) would have been a lie. I just can't believe that I am that delusional.  She sent me an email today:   I want to tell you that I love you and I do want to work on the problems in our relationship. You are very important to me.  I would be willing to have another session with Paul and you. I am open and want you to know that I am hearing you.  I still need some space as well. I hope you understand and respect that.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  It's like Dr. Jackyl and Mr. Hyde. She taking jabs at me all through our session with a complete and total lack of empathy... then I get that email. It makes me feel psychotic. PLUS - what the fuck is she talking about needing space. I have no interest in seeing her; I dread the thought of it. I can't play nice anymore.  My response:   Thank you for your willingness to meet again with Dr. Berkowitz and me. I will check availability today.  I have no intentions of approaching or contacting you in anyway unless it relates specifically to our meeting as I need the same space as you and I am currently dreading what it will be like when you return to work.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (Did I mention before that she is also my boss?)  Was I trying to hurt her? I don't know.

      Tonight's the night. I meeting with my sister and my therapist to try and work all this out.  Here's the most recent email correspondence  She wrote:  I do have an agenda for our meeting. It is new. I really tried to think hard about what is going wrong. One problem that occurs for me is that I am not able to say what problems I have in our relationship. I fear your reaction. I fear that my words will always injure you. I fear that any issue that arises in our relationship will surmount into a long conversation filled with drama, elevated feelings and further discontent.      But, I realized that letting my issues go, and not addressing them with you has allowed unresolved anger to come out in other ways. I am sure you are feeling this. When you say you want me to treat you better, I think this is what you are referring to.      I do have a specific agenda to address in our meeting. I have no expectations for how it will go.    I wrote back:  I know that my emotional reactivity and defensiveness has been a hindrance in you approaching me with problems or issues you are having about me. I have heard this from you and I am fully acknowledging that it is a hindrance. This unresolved frustration is a lot of what I sense when asking you to be nicer to me I'm sure, but it's certainly not all of it in the least.      I think the biggest problem that occurs for me is that I really don't feel like I'm treated respectfully by you. Your responses to me are hurtful, often condescending, and I often feel like you sort of expect me to disappoint or frustrate you (which I believe you have agreed is an accurate observation). I also feel like you hold the unequal balance in our relationship and present my shortcomings in this inequity without acknowledging the importance of what I bring to the relationship, focusing on what I need to improve. I also feel an inequity in our relationship regarding the accommodation and attentiveness I bring. I don’t make a point of it b/c I feel I over extend in the ways I can to make up for the ways you extend that I cannot. I do not feel like our relationship is unequal, but I feel very under valued and appreciated in reaction to your persistence regarding the perceived lack of reciprocity. Often the unexpressed frustration you were talking about can come off to me as if I am a burden and I resent you for that. Make no mistake about it; though you may not be voicing the real issues or problems, you are constantly informing me of your dissatisfaction and frustration.      Also, in regards to difficulty confronting problems, I also find you unapproachable when I have a problem or issue in relation to you. In most of these serious conversations that we have, I often feel like you deflect the burden of the dissatisfaction and, by invalidating your behavior and its impact, the conversation turns towards my psychology and my reactions to your behavior. As if your behavior is in no way indecorous and I am just being emotionally reactive. In acknowledging that you have not been expressing certain frustrations in a clear way and have been acting aggressively towards me because of this, you own the responsibility for your behavior and I thank you for that.      Furthermore, I am very uncomfortable with certain standards and ideologies that you hold as they affect me. You have asserted in conversations past that you have worked long and hard to be the person you are and that you are done changing for people, yet you are constantly pushing me to change by your insistent displeasure with my behaviors, actions or inactions. You also have expressed the mantra of "forgive, but never forget", which is, by the way, a survivor's mantra. By applying this ideology to me, I feel I am never able to sway your perception of me. Because of past offences that you may still hold, I feel am locked into that negative perception.      I will also eventually need to bring up some other issues specifically regarding some feelings of betrayal. I don’t know if I will be able to go there in one session and still cover what seem to be the immediate interpersonal problems we are having.      I have put a lot of thought into the session and I am not expecting complete resolution.   that's that  I don't really want to have this session. It will undoubtedly be difficult and upsetting, stressful... but it needs to be done, right?  I'm just tired of feeling crazy. Feeling like every issue I have with her is a product of some emotional fallibility on my part. She negates every perception I have of our relationship, especially if it reflects negatively on her. I'm tired of her setting the rules that I have to follow or else be criticized and condescended to. I'm tired of being treated like a 12 year old when I am now twice that age. I'm tired of her air of superiority when I also have strengths that surpass hers.  I don’t even know what use there is in having this session tonight. She will go on believing what she believes and behaving as she behaves and live under the influence of her own defensive denial... and then she'll loose me and she'll still find some way of deflecting fault back onto me... but I won't care anymore, right?  I don't want to do this... I don't have a choice...

      I smoked yesterday... damn me...  Just wrote a letter of love to GoogleGuy:   Dear GoogleGuy      I used to be a Ask.com girl, but I felt like Jeeves never really understood my wants and needs. I started up with Yahoo.com soon after the split, but it wasn't long before I met Google.com. I have to tell you, I am so head over heals for this sight that I can't even type straight. Google gives me straight answers and always delivers what I want, sometimes surprising me with things I didn't even know I wanted. We communicate so easily. It's a relief to have finally found the perfect search engine. I know it really cares about me.      Thank you.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  My boss, aka my sister, is on vacation... I'm alone in the office with the lingering sensation of resentment... aka I'm not doing a whole lot of work today... or for the rest of the week... I wanna cigarette...

      I was under the impression that people posted their creative works sometimes. I thought I'd do it too...  This one is not typical of my work, but it's new and atypical and therefore worthy of perusing feedback, so please comment at will...  I just hope the line breaks come across after posting  Without further delay:  First Person Omniscient (Working Title)  I step outside my story to analyze the struggles, triumphs, motifs, and omissions in my interactive chronicle of life.  Strokes of change color the plot with episodic waves of regression and progress.  Sirens of responsibility, Pied Pipers of opportunity, and serpentine repercussions  drive my life from incident to resolution with no regard for decorum or foreshadowing.  Battles are disregarded in sacrifice to the internal war of character that will, one day, end this tale as comedy or tragedy.  Silently, I mourn the unfashionable deus ex machina that would bring my fractured tale to Happily-Ever-After, but  my non-fiction epic cannot be edited by poetic intervention. So, I re-enter the tale, exchanging pen for sword and endeavor to earn its uncertain conclusion.

      I, like many people, have been smoking longer than I care to admit. However, I will admit it, 'cause what do I have to hide here? I had my first cigarette at 9. That means I've been loving cancer stick after beautiful cancer stick for about 14 years now. That's too long... or so I'm told.  Last Friday, the 13th, I had a party in celebration of my 24th birthday on the 15th. I didn't smoke on the 14th... haven't smoked since... wanna smoke...  The thing that pisses me off about it the most? I can;t drink as much caffeine anymore either. Nicotine helps break down caffeine and over-caffeination produces effects similar to that of the nicotine fit. So, no cigarettes and less caffeine.  No smoking in a coffee shop while drinking de-caf coffee... what a pathetic thought.  Good thing about it though, I have a lot of energy to write just to keep my hands occupied. I also am fairly agitated and irritable, so I also have a lot of rants running through my head to commit to paper. We'll see how it goes.  In the meantime, does anyone have a cigarette? I just want a puff, I swear, just one puff....

      I have no idea what I am even doing here.  This is the first blog I have ever encountered and it happens to be my own.  So what, I just write away into cyberspace? Alright...  I just have my 24th birthday yesterday. I live in Chicago. I have a lot of family that love me. Things are rough right now with my sister, who is actually just a really close friend of the family. I guess she's just a friend of mine, not my family's anymore. I'm really the only one who has maintained any sort of friendship with her.  You see, she moved in with us when I was 10 and she was turning 19. My brother was 13 at the time. Within 3 years of moving in she had introduced me to pot and slept with my brother among other more mild offences and betrayals to the family. Mind you I only found out about her relationship with my brother when I was 19. All the while when she was having sex with my brother, she was also calling me her sister. There is something really messed-up (not sure if I can swear here) and VC Andrews about the whole thing.  So besides the sorted history, she also is a very difficult person who, on one hand, proclaims her unwillingness to change for anyone and holds that she is not responsible for the way "she makes me feel". On the other hand, she also finds my habits and personality traits to be, at times, intolerable and expects me to change. If she doesn't expect me to change, she sure makes it uncomfortable for me to stay the same.  I am taking her to see my therapist with me on Wednesday night. We'll see how that goes, I guess.  So what else about me? I'm a poet. I'm a virgin. I'm tired and I am sort of a work in progress... much like this blog.
