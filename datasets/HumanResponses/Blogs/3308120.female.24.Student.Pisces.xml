      Microsoft just announced  urlLink plans  to opens a new branch in India.  This won't take away from any jobs here in Redmond; however, some are concerned it might.  Microsft is trying to expand it's corporation on a more worldwide basis, and India is in the middle of a great technology boom.  I think this is a good thing that we are expanding our products and services worlwide, as long as there is a demand for it.

      Next time you think about sending some spam mail, you better think  urlLink twice . Obviously the courts aren't messing around when it comes to this issue.  Seven years in prison for sending 825 million spam mails is sure a long time.  If only they were as serious when sentencing other offenses like: domestic abuse, repeat drunk drivers, theft and even manslaughter.  Hmmm....maybe I should go into into law school.

      This  urlLink article  introduces a new device that can help the blind.  It scans the visual image and then translates it into spoken word.  Pretty high tech stuff... I think this is a wonderful break-through in technology to help the visually impaired have a fuller, more complete life.

      The first quarter for the year 2004 has already seen a 39% increase in  urlLink internet advertising  compared to last year!  Now publishers have the benefit of selecting what types of ads they want displayed on their websites.  In contrast, just over two years ago publishers were taking any sort of advertising they could get.  I guess this is a good sign for the economy, that people are out there willing to spend, and make money.

      We have all seen, and felt, the effects of the currently high gas prices.  Despite what manufacturers say, don't count on any  urlLink devices  that you can buy at the auto parts store to help your vehicle get more miles to the gallon. People are resorting to trying new means to boost the fuel efficiency of their vehicles, although the EPA warns not to give in to the marketing and advertising strategies of the manufacturers.  It makes me wonder if bicycle sales are on the rise as well...

      Once again, the internet helps speed up processes that would normally take months if done in person.  This  urlLink article  states how the internet is a well used  tool when adoptive parents are looking for potential adoptive children. However, this article also reminds us not to always trust what we find on the internet.  Some adoption sites have been known to be started by false agencies that are just looking for ways to earn money.  Checking references is vital if someone is using the internet for something as important as adopting a child.

      This  urlLink article  is proof that even computers can make mistakes.  In society today, we depend on computers for so many things- to keep track of our bank accounts, credit card transactions, and even finding criminals.  But what happens if the computers make a mistake?  It is possible that some mistakes may even go undetected by humans.  In this case a Portland lawyer was arrested because part of his fingerprint matched one they found related to a terrorist attack.  After being evaluated by humans, it was concluded that the fingerprint was only a partial match and indeed, it could have been somebody elses.

      Very interesting  urlLink article  here.  With all the wordly matters going on right now (soldiers and civilians dying in Irag, children starving, and the loss of natural resources just to name a few) both Bush and Kerry have addressed in their campaign speeches that they plan to expand high speed internet access to those who currently are denied this privelage.  To me, the speed of internet connection seems like it shoud be pretty low on the president's   to do   list.  However, they are both competing for the votes of American citizens, and if we demand faster internet connection, than by all means we should be granted it.  Remember, this is America...

      According to the  urlLink Seattle Times , online grocers can look forward to increased business and profits this year.  What is interesting to me is the need and demand for online grocers currently.  Personally, I enjoy going to the grocery store, browsing the aisles trying to plan out meals for the week.  I like to look for bargains too.  So for me, the concept of ordering groceries online and having someone else pick them out seems kind of silly.  However, for people with disabilities or handicaps, ordering groceries online may be easier than making a trip to the store.  For the elderly and those who live secluded lifestyles, having groceries delivered could be a more reasonable option.

      Reading this  urlLink article  about a university in Africa makes me feel very fortunate for the educational oppurtunities I have here, as a student in America.  This specific university has a student body of about 600, with only one computer lab of 30 computers, and no internet connection.  Students have to travel 18 miles away to use a cyber cafe.  Yet, these people are determined to get educated in the modern world technology, with goals of graduating with computer science and mathematics degrees.  Their enthusiasm for learning does not hold them back while the rest of the world sits back and surfs the web.  I think this is a prime example that with a little hard work and dedication, anyone can succeed at their goals.

      A high school in Salinas, CA recently banned all use of cell phones on campus after a student was caught cheating.  The  urlLink article   states  that a student was caught photographing an exam with his camera phone and sending it to a friend.  Unfortunately, the consequences to a situation like this effects not only the student who cheated, but all the students in the school.  Hopefully they have a few pay phones on campus so students can make calls if needed.  And I'm sure that the cell phone ban won't stop students from bringing their phones to school, now they will just have to be much more discreet when using them.   urlLink   urlLink

      The  urlLink Vietnamese government  has ordered regulations to monitor citizens internet use. They are trying to crack down on the use of the interent as a means of exchanging "bad information". It sounds like the government may have something to hide and does not want it's citizens finding out.  Wow-reading this makes me even more grateful to be living in the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

      The sun is a wonderful natural heat source, as well as an energy provider.  This article talks about the benefits of using products that are  urlLink solar powered .  When you are riding a bike or talking a walk, you can strap on a solar powered pack for your batteries so they can absorb energy while you are out in the sun anyways.  Laptops, cell phones and even palm pilots are now available in solar power so the user doesn't have to worry about charging them under normal conditions.  Lets just hope the sun keeps on shining so these folks won't be left in the dark.

      Very interesting  urlLink article  about the future of cell phones.  This article talks about how cell phones are becoming, or already are, the new personal computer.  Worldwide, more people own cell phones than personal computers.  With current technology, cell phones can let you check your e-mail, get the weather forecast, and even act as a dating service.  So far, I just use my phone for making calls, but who knows, maybe in the near future I can submit a resume with it.
