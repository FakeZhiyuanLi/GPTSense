      What good mother can’t?  I just re-read my first blog entry and sure it’s hard to be away from Max, but I think I may have overstated the fact in that entry.  I just need to remember that he’s in good hands when I’m not with him. He’s learning more from other sources, as well as how to be a social little man.  He’s not clinging to me and fearing everyone else anymore.  Which I guess in a developmental light is a good thing, although in many ways it does break my heart that I’m not the center of his universe anymore.    On the topic of my melodramatic flair, at least we covered it right off the bat, so when I pull another episode of histrionics you will all just brush it off saying, “ That’s just Lissy being a drama queen again !”  and not actually feel sorry for me.    I know there are mom’s out there working a lot harder to hold their families together, feed them and keep them safe, and I should just be happy for the situation I do have.  Reliable, safe, quality day care, a great husband who would allow me to stay home in a second if our finances were in a secure enough position, and a son who loves me and isn’t suffering through something terrible because his mommy has to work (for now).     At the same time I say all of that and recognize it but the drama queen, or maybe it’s the spoiled brat that lives in my head keeps screaming “ I WANT MORE!!!  HELL, I WANT IT ALL!!!!!”   Meaning exactly what that original entry came down to.  I don’t want a stranger raising my son.  I want to be with him.    So I ask you, is this one of those things that you do because it’s what’s best for your son (since his world is expanding so much through his daycare experience), and family (because none of our bills are being turned over to collections) and just suck up the sick feeling it leaves in the pit of your stomach, or what?    Oops there I go again, right over-the-top!

      And they piss me off even more when they guilt you into doing something for them and then they don’t even show you the common courtesy that you would show a stranger.    OK I’ll stop ranting and explain.  This person, who we will call Marsha (because that’s her name I really don’t feel like protecting her), who at one time I would have called a friend, but that was many years ago under far different circumstances, is moving.  She is leaving town, breaking up with her boyfriend, selling her house, and when she told me all of this about a month ago I think she was expecting a sad "please don’t go" kind of response.  But when I heard it my only thought was, “What a great opportunity for you!  Congrats!”  Well that kind of threw her and you could actually hear the gears shift on the phone as she switched gears and decided to talk it up.  During that conversation I said something stupid like…  ”Before you go we will all have to get together or something…”    which all of know means maybe if I  get around to  it we can have lunch or something.  But her boyfriend that she’s breaking up with(did I mention she's dumping him?  Did I also mention that I don't really like him much more than I do her, I think it's because they were such a bad couple that they just annoyed everyone when together.  Although I must have liked him enough not to use his name in this rant, so I guess he ranks higher than she does.) to move calls me like 3 times asking me to put something together, that he knows sometimes people (read ME) get busy and say something but then can’t get it done and he was more than willing to help in anyway he could (and she's dumping him!), but he knew it would really mean a lot to Marsha if someone had a send off for her.  So I bust my butt and get it organized and it’s just something small, and casual, but it took a bit of work.  We use evite.com to arrange the logistics and she even replies saying she will be there and is bringing a dish.  She seems excited.    Then Saturday night came and  she didn’t show up!!!!!     I get to the party, I’m running a bit late, a girls gotta be fashionable right?  Or maybe she’s just gotta get ready with a 17 month old, either way.  So we get there and her boyfriend is there, and looking like his dog just got ran over.  So I ask  THE  question.  Where is Marsha?    He then tells us that she left early this morning for the golf course and he hasn’t been able to reach her all day.  She went to a golf outing, and forgot about her own frickin’ party that I was guilted into throwing for her to begin with!  What the hell is that?  Who does that?  Who blows off their own going away party?    So the night goes on, we bitch a little and then say screw it, we are going to have fun anyway, we don’t take the time to get together often enough anyway and whatever the reason for the gathering at least we are all there.  So a bit of bitching, a bit of eating and then we start to play poker.    No Limit Texas Hold Em!  It was a pretty fun evening, and then his cell phone rings.    It’s Marsha, she’s at home, wondering where he is and if he’ll be home tonight.  He says…  “So you haven’t been in an accident?”  She replies, “No, why?”  He says, “You aren’t dead?”  Again, “No, why?”  He says, “Well those are the only two reasons I can find that are acceptable for you to miss your own going away party!”   And hangs up on her.    20 minutes later she shows up and doesn’t even really apologize.  She gives us this half assed, “Oh sorry I was out on the golf course all day at the LPGA Futures Tournament and just forgot.”    Once again, what is that????  I was so pissed I could have spit (and if you know me at all spitting is the ultimate show of disrespect in my book).  Or maybe I was stunned.  I don’t know but it was annoying and rude.  I just can't imagine telling people I would be somewhere, something they were organizing just for me, and then blowing it off.  Not even that something important came up, but just to go watch a golf tour.      So back to the topic of this entry, rude people piss me off!!!!  How about you?

      Irritable Vowel Syndrome:   Marked by child’s inability to pronounce certain letters, most often those in his own name.  Thus Eunice becomes “Nis,” and Oscar, “Scar.”  Sequelae:  secret parental disappointment when child finally pronounces name correctly.  –Parenting Magazine   And so by this rule Max has become “Ax”.  Interestingly enough he can say “M” when it stands alone, or even when a cow says “Mooooo” but not when he says his own name.  What’s with that?  I keep trying to get him to say his name and all he’ll say is “Ax”, and occasionally he’ll say “Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm”, but not finish it.   Now when he’s talking about me he says “Baaahma” instead of Mama, and he doesn’t call his Mimi anything other than “Nini”, so maybe an “M” is difficult for him.  Who would have thunk?   So if you ask him his name he says “Ax” and I seem like the significantly heavier, and less affluent, and not nearly as talented mother that started the trend the entertainment industry seems to be following in naming their newborn children.  I mean really, if Gwenyth and Chris can name their daughter, Apple, and now Courtney and David have named their daughter, Coco, can pull of the crazy name game who am I to question Ax?  Coco, Apple and Ax, how’s that for a play group?

      Heaven in a tub of warm water!  I had my first one on Tuesday and I can tell already that I will be an addict.  I figure of all the things you could become addicted having someone else scrape your cuticles is the least likely to kill you, right?  I didn’t even get the “full meal deal” I just got the mini pedi and it was something I could really love, I’m almost afraid of trying the “SPA” pedi.  Mine included a soak in the tub, nail filing, a mini massage, cuticle maintenance, and painting.  My toes are a glorious sparkly red, with absolutely zero flaws!  There is no way I could have ever achieved this level of perfection on my own, and to boot it was a treat from my mother in law!  I could have kissed her!  I am so lucky to have such a great lady as my husband’s mom!  Not just because she pays for my cuticle maintenance either!  I think I’ll try a manicure and “SPA” pedicure next time.  I would love to have some good lookin nails!  Mine are all pretty even but my cuticles are a mess, and they don’t shine at all.  Nothing more attractive than a nicely manicured hand, in my humble opinion anyway.    On a completely different note…  M is on vacation this week and is getting a lot done around the house, but Max is still not in full time day care so M is keeping him on Tuesday and Thursday this week.  Obviously we wouldn’t arrange another sitter to come in while M is home, that would be silly.  I hate that Max is even going to day care Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but in order for M to get a lot done it’s really the only way.  So Tuesday was the first day of full time daddy care while mommy is working.  Interesting day I think.  They went shopping at “The Evil Empire” otherwise known as Walmart.  Super Walmart none-the-less.  Max did really great I guess until the very end when M walked through the produce department.  Funny kid that I have LOVES him some apples!  So when he sees them in the produce dept. he doesn’t understand that he can’t eat them until we pay.  He goes NUTTY for them apples.  Today was no exception.  The nuttiness ensued and poor M was on his own.  I got the full break down later.    I have to admit it made me laugh a little, a guilty little knowing laugh, but a laugh it was!  Then I came home from my luxurious new addiction and looked around the house.  The house which M had spent Monday cleaning.  On Monday I came home from work and it was gorgeous!  Tuesday I came home and, well…gorgeous it was not.    I had another evil moment that included an “I told you so” moment(which Megan swears I am an "I told you so" kind of person, I guess she was right!).  I went in to the kitchen to fix myself some dinner (sandwich night because of the pedicure appt.) and I noticed two major things.    One being Max’s leftover lunch plate and two being his leftover dinner plate.  Both paper, both with leftover food on them and a plastic fork and both just sitting on the counter.  Now to me this is not a big deal.  To me this is just something to pick up and toss into the trash.  BUT (the proverbial big but), while I was staying home with Max over the past year this exact thing was a HUGE issue for M.  If I left Max’s plate on the counter I would get a dissertation on how lazy it was to leave said plate out and not take the one step required to throw it away.  Well upon seeing not one plate but 2 I couldn’t hold my tongue.  I had to say something.  Obviously not my most mature moment, and probably not as well received as I had expected, but I wanted him to know that it may only require a step but sometimes when you are chasing your child around and keeping them safe that that one step may as well be a mile.    I think he gets it now.

      I read some really amazing blogs!  I am addicted to several of them. They are all amazingly passionate, honest and insane writings, by women I’ve come to respect even though I haven’t yet or will probably never meet.    I know that a blog is supposed to be you just being yourself, providing you a voice in this huge digital world we are living in, but some how I feel pressured.  I want to be  as  funny,  as  cool,  as  snarky,  as  smart, and  as  amazing as my favorite blog authors!  I want it, but I don’t want to feel pressured about keeping up, how do you do that?  How do you just let go and be yourself when you are thinking of the amazing things everyone else is saying or doing?  I think my life must seem trivial, that I’m not very exciting or very insightful, or thought provoking.  I’m just me, just Lissy, living a middle class existence in middle America doing the same stuff we all do every day, but hey, it’s me, in all of its “vanillaness”, or “white breadedness”, or whatever word I can make up to make it sound as normal/boring as I possibly can.  Some would call it normal, or boring, but I think of it as sweet and comforting.  I have a brother who lives the exotic life, owning night clubs in Hawaii.  He’s 35 years old and his life is insane.  It’s filled with parties and “friends” who come as quickly as you pick up the tab and leave just as fast when you don’t.  His life is insane (did I already say that?), and I don’t want it.  He thinks my life is lackluster, he thinks I’ve become my mom.  Lord help us all if I have become my mom (this is a HUGE issue we won’t get into today), I think I’ve just become myself.      I like taking care of my son, and belonging to a women’s service organization (trust me this aint your momma’s Junior League), I like gossiping with my friends about the bitchy girl that is leaving town, and I like having a husband (who has a very nice secure job with a great company) that doesn’t want to pursue a major career because he would rather be home with me and our son than traveling all over the world or getting transferred every 2 years.  I like it all, and I guess I’ve really chosen it.  So why am I trying to rationalize it?  Make it OK with you?  I guess as I’ve been typing this I’ve realized my little life is a life I’m proud of and nothing to apologize to anyone for, especially not people I will probably never meet!  So there it is, screw the competition, and the horses they rode in on.  I have enough issues with people I do know, like my siblings, or my mother, I don’t need to harbor issues with people I don’t even know.  So I officially end the competition to be funny, cool, smart, witty, or just plain exciting.   Now that was liberating, the pressure is off!

      is you are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  You love your child, you love being with him, you love seeing him grow, and learn and be a pain in the butt.  You just love him. But the bills have to be paid.  How can you find a balance?    I had the  "fortunate"  experience of being laid off 3 months after his birth, 3 weeks after returning from maternity leave.  I was shocked by the lay off, I was hurt by the lay off, my ego was crushed by the lay off, but on the bright side of "the lay off" I got to stay home for a year being paid by unemployment insurance to take care of my new son.   THE LAY OFF  will always be considered a gift to me.  It gave me the gift of time, time to get to know my son, time to get to know myself as a mother, and time to realize there are better things in life than sending a job to the printer.  The  "unfortunate"  side of all of this is eventually the unemployment ran out, and I had to live off the savings for a while, sucking them dry and now I'm back at work.  I hate it, I hate having a stranger take care of my son, I hate that I don't see everything he does all day, I hate that evenings are rushed, and most of all I hate feeling like I'm missing something.  No not like when you forget to pay a bill and you worry about it, that nagging feeling, not it's so much more.  It's a wake you up in the middle of the night screaming to try to save him kind of pain.  It's an emptiness, a hollowness, a void.  (I know redundancy will not make the point stronger, but it helps me feel like I've covered it.)  We worked so long and so hard to get Max here and now I don't even get to enjoy him.
