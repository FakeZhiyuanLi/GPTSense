      So I heard around this time last year about some  urlLink steakhouse  in Manhattan selling hamburgers at 41 bucks a pop.  I thought maybe it was just because the restaurant was some ridiculously ritzy place.  It turns out it is because of the beef being used, which is from a special breed of Japanese  urlLink cattle , and is served in quite a number of other restaurants around the US.  So, to save you the read (though as far as newsletters about cattle go, I'd say this is pretty exciting stuff) these cows are massaged and fed beer throughout their life.  The original reason for this treatment, which by the way sounds like a pretty sweet deal, was due to the limited amount of land resources in Japan.  Not a lot of room for activity so massage keeps the muscles stimulated and not much in way of grains so they are switched to a beer diet during the summer months.  It turns out overcoming one's limitations makes for damn delicious beef.  Now I'm no vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination, but who wants to pay over $40 for a hamburger that was basically gotten drunk and felt up just before it died?    Ok, fine... I do.

      ... don't do it.  Apparently the authorities frown upon it.  I figured while I was talking about my driving karma, I might as well mention my little run-in with the law about a month ago.  I left work early on a Friday because I was driving to Ohio that day to go to  urlLink King's Island , home of The Beast (my favorite roller coaster of all time) and then on to  urlLink Cedar Point . I am a coaster fan, obviously.  Well, fan or not, no amount of enthusiasm excuses you from threatening the lives of children.  And that is exactly what I did... within the narrow eyes of the law, at least.  I was headed towards home earlier than usual and when I was on the road, just before the turn in to my neighborhood, a school bus was coming in the opposite direction.  Now, it had just slowed and the STOP sign was in the process of coming out as I was next to it.  Also note that it was in the far lane and I was as well, so we were separated by two lanes of traffic.  Well, I didn't want to slam on the breaks, nor was I completely positive on the non-touching lanes rule, but the flashing blue lights that sprung up behind me was a nice reminder.  The cop was your average cop and I was just an admitted lunk head so our exchange wasn't anything you'd see on COPS where I'm outside of my car in my wife beater while my baby's mamma is yelling at me with her curlers still intact, a cigarette limp in her mouth, and our two year old girl propped precariously on her hip, all the while the cop holding out one hand and murmuring "Calm down, ma'am... sir", with his other hand resting on his holstered Glock.  No, it wasn't anything like that.  I got a ticket instead.  That's fine, I was stupid so I'll pay up.  The city I live in mails you a notice with the amount, so when I hadn't received it within the 10 days suggested, I called.  There was a discrepancy with my address.  I moved last year and I forgot about my license address being wrong until this ordeal.  Anyway, I asked for the amount and where to send the payment.  Two-hundred and sixty-two dollars.  That's $262 in numeric money.  I totally missed the address because it's hard to hear over the words TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DOLLARS echoing in your head.  You know... I like kids and everything, but it's not like I killed any.  What was this, a per head count?  Well, I had to get a money order unless I wanted to take off work to pay in person.  When I called back just to confirm everything, the woman said, "Yes, sir.  It's two-hundred sixty-two fifty."  I paused to let that soak in.  "And fifty cents?" I asked.  "Yes, sir."  I swear the first woman hadn't mentioned the fifty cents, but whatever.  "I got the money order for just two-hundred and sixty-two, could I possibly mail two quarters with it?"  Now she paused.  "I guess."  This posting would be a lot funnier if I had trusted the woman and mailed my money order along with two quarters only to be arrested tomorrow.  My court date was scheduled for today and me not showing up would have made for one interesting Casual Friday.  But, I wasn't too keen on going to jail over fifty cents and an "I guess."  So anyway, I have taken it upon myself since then to tell everybody what a dumbass I was and remind them that under no circumstances is it okay to not stop for a school bus.  A small price to pay for our world's future.  Damn, they're expensive little snots, though.

      A few weekends ago I experienced the fruitier side of road rage.  I was headed for a Goodwill I had been to once before.  I've been looking for a cheap table that I can grout and tile over to use as patio furniture, but haven't found the perfect match just yet.  Anyway, I was in the left turn lane when I realized that I needed to go one more block.  The two right lanes went straight so I looked over to the closest one, put on my signal that I was merging back into traffic, then did so when all was clear.  One block later, back in the left turn lane and I heard a BEEP~ of a car horn close by.  I half look around out of curiosity and two lanes over a black SUV is stopped, parallel with me, and the driver is quite animated with his hands spread and yelling something that I presumably did.  I looked, squinted, then mouthed, "What?" because honestly, I had no clue.  He continued to gesture and yell, but really... can this conversation be successfully held across two lanes of traffic?  And furthermore can any injustice that I allegedly committed be resolved in the span of half a red light?  I mouthed "Sorry?" and there was a definite question mark in the expression and slight shrug that went along with it.  So I looked away, waiting for the light to change and then.... thhHHOOOOP!  Squeal... all lights were green and the black SUV scooted away.  But not before I gave a small yawn and casually leaned over to turn my radio up.  Translation -- "You've effected me this much sir."  But there was a bit of concern; my '98 Jeep Cherokee is still dent and scratch free on the whole, and it would be nice if it could remain so.  I make the turn into the Goodwill parking lot and hop out.  Upon inspection, the passenger side had remained unblemished.  So now the concern was replaced by curiosity.  What did that guy throw?  Obviously something expendable, like trash, but heavy enough to give a decent thunk.  I did my business (no luck on the scrap table) and then decided to investigate.  I drove one block further east so I could come back through the intersection from the opposite direction.  I passed under the light, slowed, looked over, and resting there next to the curb on the far side was a cantaloupe!  So many questions run through one's mind when they've been fruited.  What could be so bad that you are forced to throw your only cantaloupe at someone?  Or did he have an extra?  And if so, who drives around with a SPARE cantaloupe?  I really hope that when he told the story to whomever was waiting on that cantaloupe he said I ran over children and that the cantaloupe had busted my windshield or something.  I can only assume that I accidentally cut him off when merging back into traffic from the first turn lane I was in, but seriously folks... is it worth wasting perfectly good fruit?

      Thanks to my friend Julie for the correct spelling of Tourette's in my last post.  I had tried the spell check option, but it thought I meant castle turrets.  At least I recognized that as incorrect.  Then I asked  urlLink Jeeves , and his suggestion of TURET'S, which I had before my friend intervened and I updated, was apparently wrong as well.  But you know, I'm sure that Jeeves gets tired of answering the same old questions day in and day out: ROOSTER-SHAPED OVEN MITS FOR SALE ON E-BAY. SHIPS IN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS... HOT PICTURES OF ANNA KOURNIKOVA. WALLPAPERS, POSTERS, DESKTOP THEMES, MORE...  So, just to mix things up for the poor guy, I like to engage him a little more personally.  Though judging from his responses, he's not used to the attention. Q) What's going on? A) REGISTER ONLINE, PREPARE WITH REAL SAT QUESTIONS... Q) Got any big weekend plans? A) KNITTING AND OTHER LAZY ACTIVITIES IN A BUSY LIFE... Q) So is that what a British manservant search engine does with his free time? A) TOM SELLECK WAS SO GOOD LOOKING!...  Even though the man apparently can't spell worth a flip, I think we should all take a moment to get to know the man behind the machine before we rush on with our selfish inquiries.  Just a thought.  Of course gon't tell him, but I prefer  urlLink GOOGLE , myself.

      Well, I wanted to tinker with a blog setting or two just to see the effects before I made this public.  So now, tinkering complete, I'm satisfied.  I used to know a goodly amount of html, but that was for the two weeks I had to write a web page for my Advanced Programming class in college.  The page got an 'A', but the knowledge got the boot.  Making room for such vital information as the distance of Earth from the sun and lyrics to songs I am ashamed to mention.  Anyway, so it looks like my initial entry worked just fine.  Not that this is brain surgery, but sometimes it's a nice feeling when something (technology to be specific) works the way it should.  Perhaps it is my recent dealing with a particularly irritating piece of tech-ery that makes something as simple as a web page successfully updating seem like the discovery of fire.  The culprit is DirecTV.  I have (or had) them as my satellite service provider.  The system was installed last year, though they had to drill a hole or three through my walls--rather than patching through the existing cable--to get things to work.  Well, things have been mostly fine, with the exception of a garbled signal when it rains... or looks like it may rain... or when I say the word "rain"...  But anyway, the past few weeks have been exceptionally bad regardless of weather conditions.  It was as if scrambled porn and a turn table with Tourette's had a love child on every single channel.  Anyway, so I made a service call and the guy says, "Yeah, this should never have been installed here.  Your trees in the backyard are directly in the dish's line of sight."  Yeah, a little irritating.  Well, he suggested that I could raise the dish, but I would need to check with my Home Owner's Association.  Fine.  That makes sense.  Oh, and I have to buy and cut a special fencing pipe myself.  Less fine.  Less sense.  But I'm still amiable.  So I do all of the above and reschedule a service call.  The man calls at the beginning of when he's supposed to be there asking if I had permission and the equipment.  "Yes, that is what I was told to do and why you're scheduled to come out."  Then he claims that "they've" got him all over the place today so he might not make it.  Well, sorry, but am I not one of those places?  He had from 1pm to 5pm and I had plans at 7.  So 5:30, still not there and I call to tell him forget it.  I call DirecTV and see if they can make an appointment on Sunday which they can't because that's special and handled locally and blah blah... things I understand, but am too irritated to care about.  Then on top of that, he mentions that the comment on the work request says I needed to have permission to raise the dish "in writing" from the HOA.  What!?  More hoops to jump through.  More irritation.  The customer service guy tries to say how bad he's got it because he has to open the window in his apartment on cloudy days.  I try to care, but fail to.  I spent the rest of the day pondering if it was worth it.  And then the answer came to me.  As I was flipping through the 99.9% garbled junk, one channel comes in clearly.  It was running the movie " urlLink From Justin To Kelly ".  Fortunately the sound was muted, but even in closed caption it made me a little sick to my stomach.  This is when I realized that things just weren't going to work out between me and DirecTV.  I called, got my service disconnected as of midnight that night, and the next day in the mail got a promo to "Ditch The Dish" and get $400 from  urlLink Comcast  cable, which is what my neighborhood is prewired for.  So... life sucks for a short period of time, then things change to make it even--if not slightly better.  I suppose that "crappy satellite reception" runs low on the list of the world's problems, but there you have it.

      Cliche for a first blog entry, but does it help if I were referring to a song by  urlLink Bare Naked Ladies ?  If so then we already have something in common and isn't that just wonderful?  If not then I really feel that you're setting the bar a tad high.  I mean, honestly...

      Everyone has their reasons to go to the gym.&nbsp; Some go to build strength or for physical therapy, others may want to control their cholesterol or lose weight.&nbsp; Those are all fine and good, but the primary reason for me is to avoid the 5-7pm rush hour.&nbsp; Yes, I would rather endure physical pain than wait any longer in traffic than I have to. &nbsp; Anyway, I had done some laps in the pool a few weeks ago and was ready for a shower and a blissfully short drive home afterwards. &nbsp; I enter the shower, which is just a central pipe with six shower heads fanned out, and a few seconds later another guy comes in and starts the shower head right next to mine.&nbsp; Now, I'm pretty sure the world is aware of the social nuances of "urinal etiquette", and if anything I believe it applies even more so in public showers. &nbsp; Didn't think that much about it, but then the guy starts talking to me asking me how my work out was.&nbsp; Now this may have been acceptable if&nbsp;I already&nbsp;knew this person, but even then our conversation&nbsp;should have consisted of: "Hey." -- "Hey." -- "Good work out?" -- "Yeah.&nbsp; You?" -- "Yeah."&nbsp; But oh no, this dude wanted details.&nbsp; "What did you do?"&nbsp; "Ran a little, then swam," I said, already at the max limit of words I would usually exchange at that point. &nbsp; Well, he starts telling me how he was running too and training for a&nbsp;marathon and maybe I'm making up rules at this point, but these aren't the times to strike up any type of deep or lengthy conversation.&nbsp; But maybe&nbsp;the guy was just being sociable so I made&nbsp;some throw away comment about how that must be tough. &nbsp; I guess I should have given a more non-responsive "Yeah" because he launched into his training schedule and different races he's done.&nbsp; At this point I'm finished and turning off my shower head when he says, "Sure could go for a massage right now, though." &nbsp; Ok, so how does one respond to that?&nbsp; I didn't want to make any assumptions--though they may have been accurate ones--about this guy's persuasion and how much of a statement versus request that was.&nbsp; And so for lack of anything better I nod and say, "Well... good luck with that." &nbsp; As a sidebar, that's what Andy Richter, in his short-lived FOX show Andy Richter Control The Universe, said&nbsp;to a co-worker when he got an employee referral bonus after her referral was stoned to death for driving a bumper car&nbsp;and she commented to him, "I was going to use the money for Grammy's Varicose vein surgery... she's always wanted to de-vein those grotesque legs..." &nbsp; What a versatile turn of phrase.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. Richter.

      On the topic of odd events at restaurants...  Me and my old roommate from college grabbed a late dinner at TGIFriday's one Friday night.  I would insert a quip about Friday at Friday's or something to that effect, but that would be pretty gay.  Plus I hate trying to humor someone when they make some pun about my last name being 'Hay' and 9 times out of 10 I wind up responding with... "Oh wow, I need to tell my parents that one!"... especially when they say something really unoriginal.  So, in the interest of TGIFriday's not being a jackass to me, I'll save the one liner.  Anyway, things were a little slow and we had Cindy as our server, whose name has been changed here for her protection.  This was Cindy's first week and she compensated for her lack of speed and order blunders with extra giggles and the occasional 'hon' rather than 'sir'.  Or maybe that was just "classic" Cindy.  We got our food and were nearly done when I overheard a hushed conversation between the hostess and another server.  "Did you hear?" breathed the hostess.  "The square dancers called and they're on their way."  "Oh no, this late?"  The hostess nodded gravely.  "So they'll have to be in Cindy's section," she added.  "You'll have to help."  The other woman looked somewhere between exasperated and horrified and I couldn't tell if it was the square dancers or the idea of working with Cindy.  Needless to say, my interest was peeked.  We wondered what about this group would cause someone to speak so conspiratorially as if she were referring to the mob.  Perhaps it was just the size of the group.  Or maybe they were monsters to deal with or notoriously poor tippers.  We traded theories, but the more we overheard other murmured bits of conversation between staff members and looks of fear or pity, the more these explanations seemed insufficient.  We were determined to stay.  Six or seven tables were pushed together right next to us and by the time the first couple came in, we were well done with our meal.  The woman was in her mid-sixties.  An alarmed gray cat was dead and hairsprayed into position on her head and no one had bothered to tell her.  She and her partner wore turquoise with more confidence than anyone you will ever know.  Hers in the form of a dress complete with puffed sleeves and a poofy skirt that sounded like Christmas presents being unwrapped whenever she moved.  His was a simple shirt with his name on the pocket and black slacks.  When the next wave came in, we noticed some of the women were also wearing slick black jackets with 'Cobb County Squares' embroidered on the back in bright red.  My roommate looked up at me nervously.  "Oh my god... THEY'RE IN A GANG."  "Take it easy man," I whispered to him.  "We don't want any trouble and I'm sure they don't either."  After a few minutes of trying not to laugh at each other we decided it was time to go.  We paid with a credit card, and as we were waiting to sign, one Lady Square was on her way past us and to the restroom.  There was a step up between our section and the rest of the restaurant and she lurched over the elevation change, but her ninja-like square dancing reflexes paid off and she stabilized.  However, the nearby manager, who seemed supremely happy that the Cobb County Squares were there, said... "Watch that step miss, it's a dosie doe."  My roommate and I looked at each other in brief verification that we both heard the same thing.  That those words were spoken out loud.  The man seemed far too pleased with himself.  I wondered how long he had been sitting on that cunning word play.  How many nights since that original thought had he secretly hoped for one of the Squares to take a spill.  We left quickly, mindful of our step and with the mutual warning of "Don't make eye contact!" on our way out.

      I love Taco Bell.  Say what you will about the quality of food, tell me all of the urban legends about roach eggs you want... but that's some tasty Americanized Mexican and hella-cheap to boot.  Don't get me wrong, I love my authentic south of the border fare, where every dish for some reason is served on a platter-full of refried beans and the chips and salsa flow like milk and honey.  However, when you're in high school or college and living off the change in your car coin holder, the Bell is the way to go.  To say I ate there every day for the last two years of high school may be stretching it, but I can almost guarantee that the number of missed meals was only perhaps a fortnight's worth.  Though the frequency decreased through college and up to present day... I can safely say my stomach is currently clad in lead with a soft gordita shell coating.  As an aside, "gordita" in Spanish is an affectionate term meaning "little fat girl".  Who the hell was sitting in on THAT menu brainstorming session?  Anyway, my two noteworthy Taco Bell stories stem from my high school days of patronage.  I usually ordered a beef burrito and a soft taco back in the day (though now I'm more a meximelt/beef baja gordita kind of guy... sort of like growing up Presbyterian and scooching over to Methodist except with tacos rather than God).  So there I was, eating the usual, and a guy from the back comes around and asks tentatively, "Is uh... everything all right, sir?"  I look up between mouthfuls of burrito goodness and respond, "Yeah."  "I mean your burrito... is it... O K ?"  I still respond positively, though with much more of a question mark of my own.  "How about I bring you another one.  In case that one's not good."  Now mind you I was already halfway through my first.  Thoughts of stray hairs, him dropping his class ring, and everything down the fast food gone awry list came to mind.  But then, the two most beautiful words (which incidentally combine into the most beautiful phrase) in the English language surfaced:  Free.  Food.  "Ok," I said.  And another beef burrito was out and on my muted tone Santa Fe-inspired plastic tray in under a minute.  The second burrito was as good as the first, but the question of WHAT!? still lingers to this day.  Fortunately my second Taco Bell story was not related to the food.  A young mother and her two children walked into a side door that passed by the dining area.  I didn't really notice them until the little boy (about 7-years-old) did a double take and stared at me.  I looked up briefly, but didn't really think much about it as he scurried off to rejoin his mom.  Well, once they had ordered and rounded the corner, the boy leaned over to his little sister (maybe age 5) and whispered loudly.  "See, there he is... that's Daddy."  I slowly turned my head to search and yeah, I was the only one there.  The sister perked up immediately and squealed, "Daddy!  Daddy!"  The mother was already bent down and shushing fervently.  "No dear..." she said, "shhh... shhh".  This did not help, the boy was staring at me wide-eyed, and the little girl was now reaching out, all the while I craned back in my booth probably with a deer-in-headlights look and beef dripping from my burrito.  Fortunately they had their order to go.  The mother took her daughter's hand and half-dragged her to the opposite side of the dining area and out through the door, muttering a half "Sorry, sir," between shushes on her way out.  Once again... WHAT!?  I suppose I can imagine a backstory there, but being blindsided with absolutely nothing to go on is probably more entertaining (and less sad) than the truth.

      FANatic.  That old show on MTV where average people got to meet their favorite celebrities.  I saw it twice in college.  Once because some guy at my school got to see Sheryl Crow and I wanted to support my kitchen window's 3 seconds of stardom when the limo came to pick him up.  The second time I was just flipping through, but this particular "FAN" left such an immediate impression, I had to watch the rest.  The celebrity was Jennifer Lopez.  And they start out by introducing you to the fan and giving a few FANatic bullet points.  This girl's name was Michelle or something.  Now, understandably, the people on this show aren't just fans... they're fanatics, hence the clever title.  So what this means, dear viewer, is that instead of posters on the wall, these people have life-size cardboard cut-outs.  Where a fan would have an autograph, FANatics have bits of hair.  And while many would jump at the chance to see their idol behind closed doors, a greater majority would prefer seeing them from behind nearby bushes.  So, fun facts about Michelle...  FAN FACT#1: Michelle tells her mother to refer to her as "Jennifer" whenever she calls to leave a message.  The camera zooms in on an answering machine and sure enough, we hear a woman's voice telling "Jennifer" to meet her at 8 or something to that effect.  We're already off to quite a start here.  FAN FACT#2: Whenever Michelle eats at home she makes sure to leave a space for Jennifer just in case she comes by.  Michelle and her mom are sitting at a small round table across from one another eating lasagna while a third empty dish is set, complete with fork, knife, and an 8x10 glossy of J-Lo propped in front.  The only thing that saves Michelle here is the fact that she didn't go ahead and serve her perpetually absent guest, though I don't know if that's enough to comfort me at this point.  FAN FACT#3: Michelle thinks that Jennifer would be a good person to eat Coochie Fritos with.  What!?  This is where I completely lose any degree of understanding.  First of all, what are Coochie Fritos?  A Puerto Rican delicacy?  If not, do I want to know?  And second, though perhaps even more important, what exactly constitutes a "good person" to eat said Coochie Fritos with?  I watched the rest of the show secretly hoping that Michelle had smuggled some in to the interview for the two to share.

      I read somewhere that a human's taste buds "reset" every six or seven years. I can pinpoint when this happened to me in both the positive and negative respect. First off, gummy bears... or gummy worms, or anything in the dysfunctional gummy family. I used to love them until I was about 13 or 14. Then the magic just stopped for me. It had less to do with gummy products being considered juvenile and more to do with the idea of putting one in my mouth made me nauseas. Even though I've gone through another taste bud "cycle" since then, the thought of gummy bears still makes me want to gag a skosh.  On the upside, a few months after I turned 20 I remember making the shocking discovery that I liked--nay--loved onions. I mean ridiculously and borderline inappropriately loved onions. Something that deep you think I would have been aware of before then.  Anyway, so I'm sold on the idea that one's personal tastes can change every so often and I exercise that belief by trying foods I know I don't like once in a while. The good news is, if I still hate them, I don't have to try again for another six or seven years. I'm holding out for the day where I suddenly love tuna or develop an isatiable urge to eat Easter Peeps.

      Okay, so I'm assuming that everyone has walked through a Macy's or Bloomingdales or any generic anchor store in a mall. And if you're anything like me it's usually on your way from the parking lot and straight through to more interesting things.  Well, there was one particular department store--I can't remember which--where the associates dressed in these long trench coats.  This was disturbing enough because I was always under the impression that they had extra vials strapped under either side of the coat. Like they were fake Rolex dealers willing to give you "the good stuff" if you didn't go for the displays.  The color of the coats was my next issue. Some associates wore all white. Given the design, they looked very nearly like lab coats which made me want to ask, "Who do you think you're fooling?" No offense to spray girls, but it doesn't take a PhD in Chemistry to squirt a slip of paper, wave it under a stranger's nose, and whisper "Obsession... Calvin Klein".  This department was comprised of two large counters on either side of the main entrance into the rest of the mall and the trench coats on the opposing side were all back. This is where I start to take a mental journey.  First of all, it was pretty hard to bypass this area unless you went way around and it's not like I had that big of an aversion to them... I found it almost entertaining in fact. But maybe that's just what they wanted us to think. It's just perfume. No big deal.  However, the more I walked between those two unavoidable counters divided by light and dark, the more it seemed to me that they represented the forces of good and evil. The balance of the world... the human condition... was being decided in that very perfume department.  One day Mrs. Jenkins decides to try Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor causing some guy in Syracuse, NY to decide to volunteer at a local soup kitchen... the next day our curious Mrs. Jenkins wants to get a whiff of the enigma that is J-Lo by sampling Glo Perfume and that poor guy in Syracuse gets mugged after completing his civic duty.  Wouldn't it also be interesting if she got carried away with the spraying and it caused whoever came into contact with her to donate all of their money to non-profit organizations or, conversely, go on random killing sprees?

      I flew up to Vermont this past weekend to help a friend move to Philadelphia.  I had a mouth ulcer, but it's hardly worth mentioning.  The original plan was to fly up Wednesday night, take in scenic Vermont on Thursday, pick up and pack up the U-Haul on Friday (it had already been "reserved"), drive to Philly on Saturday as we tow her car then unpack, and a nice evening followed by Sunday morning in Philly when I would fly back.  Well, we get a message on Thursday that "Equipment returns are running behind" and there would be a delay. My friend called back and they offered no additional information besides they would call when one was available... whenever that was. Apparently when you "reserve" a U-Haul online, you are reserving the right to drive one... eventually. Like it's the waiting list for a heart transplant or something.  So we wait... come up with contingency plans, each one worse than the last... and wait some more. During this time I get a sunburn and a tension headache or two, but nothing to cry about. Friday comes and goes. Errands are run, but nothing from U-Haul.  Follow up calls with U-Haul on Saturday. What we need is still not available... IN THE ENTIRE STATE. Other companies are called, but apparently people only want to move TO Vermont and rarely need to move out so our options were slim.  Remember that ulcer that was hardly worth mentioning? Well, I was chewing and swallowing awkwardly to avoid the pain and lo and behold the process made my throat sore and irritated. Okay so now I'm starting to get annoyed with my ulcered, sunburned, headached, sore throated body, but whatever.  We decide on Saturday that the worse case scenario would be to load up the essentials in her car and drive to Philly early Sunday if we hadn't heard anything by then. Regardless of U-Haul, I had to catch my return flight, but that would suck for the both of us.  Late Saturday (when we were supposed to have already been to Philly and unpacked), we hear from U-Haul that they may have something close by and would contact us. They finally did, we drove to a nearby city to pick it up (a story all its own), and started loading the truck around 7pm.  At 10:30 we were ready to go... just load the car on the car dolly and go. Everything was carefully secured and aligned and oh wait, the dolly socket popped off the trailer hitch when she drove up the ramp. Many minutes of slowly backing the car down to try and lower the dolly back down to the hitch commenced. It was like some bizarro commercial spot for Saturn as a family vehicle where the gimmick is the Saturn is on one side of a see-saw and your family is on the other, except instead of your family it was just me, and I don't think your family could have potentially lost any digits in that commercial nor would they have cussed as much, because that would probably rub consumers the wrong way.  Well, we get it back down and aligned and tighten the hell out of the hitch. One more go and--yeah this night sucks.  It's 11pm now. We're both physically if not emotionally exhausted and there is zero interest in trying the dolly again. Our solution, ditch the dolly and drive the 8 hours separately. Getting a good rest beforehand wasn't an option as she was officially out of her apartment, and we were just ready to be gone.  So we make the drive, my only partners being a slew of late night DJs and a quart of some generic Welch's Berry juice which I will gladly be the spokesman for after that trip. We arrive in Philly and are met by a slight FLASH FLOOD. Finding her new apartment wasn't too difficult thanks to the grid system, but getting the mattress out to sleep--which is all we wanted to do at this point--was pretty impossible until the rain let up.  So we lay in her newly painted apartment, on her newly stripped, sanded, and revarnished floors, in some semblance of rest. I may have dozed off for 15 minutes but I was fairly congested from all the fumes and couldn't sleep. Plus I had been soaked in the short sprints from U-Haul to apartment.  The rain finally lets up, a friend that was coming up from DC to help was delayed due to the flooding so we just decided to start unpacking. Help did come, but I believe I have done more than enough set up to accurately diagnose my current physical condition.  Ulcer, sunburn, headache, sore throat, heavy lifting, fatigue, drenching, not too mention one helluva sprint to catch my connecting flight on the way back... I hate complainers, but man I felt pathetic.  So as far as endings go, my friend is now somewhat-successfully living in Philadelphia and I am back in Atlanta, also somewhat-successfully living. I learned that I hate U-Haul, I love Vermont food, and I can never relocate again.

      I practice safe surfing.  However, that doesn't prevent the slew of tenacious college girls (and their bevy of adventurous roommates) from attempting to interest me in their web cam from time to time. Just trying to pay tuition no doubt... bless their over-showered hearts.  Well, pop ups apparently are the gateway drug for computers. Or maybe like gray hairs because the more I killed, the more I had. I tried fiddling with security settings in Internet Explorer and a few Ad-Alert and Spyware solutions, but it was too late. My computer had just been around the block too many times.  Also my Norton Anti-Virus software was Win98 and I now run XP. There were some compatibility issues and it wasn't able to catch everything.  So I finally decided to wipe my hard drives clean and start anew; the computer version of born again virginity. Hence the bit of blog lag.  I'd write more, but I'm currently caught in the graceful dance between coughing up one's lung and dry heaving. If computer viruses were communicable I'd be blaming my PC, but then again if I had what it did; it would be more like a burning sensation in embarrassing areas and would require some type of ointment to treat.
