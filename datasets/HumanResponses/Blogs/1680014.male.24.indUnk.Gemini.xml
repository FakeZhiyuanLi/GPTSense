      Gossip. Rumour. Tittle-tattle and idle hearsay is what it’s all about during the media's ‘silly season’, a time when only absolute bollocks is reported because there’s nothing legitimate, or even remotely interesting to write about.  With paper to be wasted, newspapers stuff their blank pages with stories of who Jordan’s shagging, Charlotte Church smoking ‘large, roll up cigarettes’ and the all-important Shane Ritchie debt-o-meter.  But, if the truth be told, Bluebirds.tv is interested in this type of ‘novelty’ reporting, only in a different context. At this time of year, kiss and tell stories or the Big Brother losers are not given a second thought. Only one thing occupies the mind of this dedicated City fan – football transfers.  Unconfirmed speculation creates a buzz around the club and gives the supporters hope, but the stories must be believable and non-contradictory for them to appear valid – two factors missing from the  South Wales Echo’s  latest article.   With a bare back page staring back at the sportsdesk hours before deadline, and with only tired old news about missing out on Jason De Vos and probably Julian Gray needing to be recycled and padded out to 500 words, what better way to keep the editor sweet than to toss some transfer gossip into the mix?  Lennie Lawrence’s sloth-like performances in the transfer market are bound to be the basis of many ‘nearly’ signings over the coming weeks, but they need to be researched a little before going to press, otherwise they just don’t ring true.  Apparently, City’s number one central midfield target was not Lee Bullock, an exciting young prospect going for a song, but ageing former Bolton midfielder Per Frandsen, who conveniently joined play-off nearly men Wigan almost a week ago.  If Cardiff are faffing around over whether or not to sign a desperate kid from York then how could a move for a big earner like Frandsen even be contemplated?   While Lee Bullock’s proposed wage would be meagre to say the least, Frandsen would be looking for a lucrative salary after playing for moneybags Blackburn and twice for Bolton, a club now set to sign Rivaldo on wages in excess of £100,000 per week.  And fans begrudged Gareth Whalley his 23-match bonus.  The more Bluebirds.tv thinks about it, the more unrealistic this transfer sounds. You have been rumbled,  South Wales Echo , there is no way Frandsen was even a back-up target, let alone a primary one.  Furthermore, at 34-years-old, Lennie would have ruled him out instantly after his ‘I don’t want a squad full of 30 year olds’ comment last week when rejecting Nathan Blake’s plea to return to Ninian Park.  What next? Paul Gascoigne lined up to play alongside Kav because Rhyl couldn’t afford to pay him enough kebab money?

      While kicking a ball and poncing around in designer clothes must be classed as a ‘hobby’ and not really ‘work’ as such, the woman at the Job Centre helpline begged to differ, even after half an hour of arguing the point with Bluebirds.tv and threatening to report the call to British Telecom.  She was adamant football is as much a job as working on a building site or driving a taxi, because apart from getting paid for what they do, the players have other interests besides the beautiful game and don’t spend ‘after hours’ work practicing taking penalties or doing keepy-ups in the garden, unless they are Michael Owen of course.  It is well documented that Alan Shearer enjoys creosoting his garden fence and Keith Gillespie spent more time at the bookies than was good for him, so as the rest of us slave away thanklessly for the minimum wage, Bluebirds.tv was interested to know what the terrace idols at Ninian Park do with their leisure time in between training, checking their bank balance and playing the odd game of football.  Does Barker collect butterflies? Is Campbell keen on crotchet? As yet, both are unconfirmed, but this week Lennie Lawrence revealed he enjoys nothing better than switching off his two mobile phones (how Hollywood) and going for a jog to escape the day-to-day rigours of (Ninian) Park Life.  “One day I just started running” he said in a soft Southern drawl. “It's probably the only 'hobby' I have - there just isn't time for anything else.”  While it’s not for Bluebirds.tv to suggest what Lennie does in his waking hours, spending less time avoiding the dog mess on Heath Park and more time pulling his finger out in the transfer market should be enough to keep him occupied.  Even though the Football League season doesn’t officially end until the last play-off final ball is kicked on Bank Holiday Monday, City may have already lost out on four potential transfer targets, because Lennie has been too busy stretching his legs rather than the club’s limited transfer budget.  Former Wigan defender Jason De Vos, the perfect antidote to Lennie’s sickening for a ‘big and ugly’ defender, joined Ipswich on a free transfer this afternoon, while former Bluebird Mark Delaney has vowed to fight for his place at Villa Park, or join either Newcastle or Middlesbrough, depending on who you believe.  Winger Julian Gray, a former loan signing and a player keen on a move to the Welsh capital, is unlikely to join either. City were not prepared to stump up £800,000 to secure his services when he was unwanted and unloved at Crystal Palace, but scintillating performances following his return to Selhurst Park is likely to ensure Premiership football for Gray next season, whether the Eagles win promotion or not.  City are also stalling on the £75,000 (12 ½ weeks of Gareth Whalley’s wages) transfer fee to sign York midfielder Lee Bullock. If the club doesn’t move soon then vultures Leeds, Leicester, Nottingham Forest, both Sheffield clubs or the mighty Stockport County are circling.  In the event that Cardiff have missed out on all of the above players, City's failsafe transfer system of showing-interest-but-not-following-it-up-allowing-another-club-to-step-in added another player they won’t sign to the list, step forth Millwall goalkeeper Tony Warner.  The former Liverpool and Celtic stopper has all the credentials of a sound transfer target, therefore ruling him out of a move to Ninian Park.  Highly rated, available on a free transfer and, at 6ft 4ins, has the imposing between-the-sticks presence both Alexander and Margetson have failed to provide.  Make a move, Lennie, and let’s not have a repeat of last year’s transfer fiasco.

      Getting the all-clear from the G.U.M. clinic after a drunken three-stroker with the cackling wench from Canton, or when that bird you’ve been knocking off for a few weeks takes a home-pregnancy test and it comes back negative.  Both great senses of relief, but not as great as the news this afternoon when Lennie Lawrence firmly dispelled any chances Nathan Blake had of making a return to Ninian Park.  "Signing Nathan would be popular with a lot of our supporters - but my job is to get us results," said Lennie, clearly unimpressed with Blake’s solitary goal in 13 Premiership appearances for Wolves this season.  Even if it is an improvement on Alan Lee’s.  The goal Blakey scored to dump Premiership outfit Manchester City out of the FA Cup in 1993 will always be remembered, but that was 11 years ago and apart from a 25 goal haul for Bolton in 1996/97, he has done very little since.  Earlier this week five-times relegated Blake, who helped City win promotion to Division Two in 1993, admitted "it would be good to play for the club again".  Call Bluebirds.tv cynical but where he talks about ‘the’ club, it is difficult not to replace it with the word ‘any’.  But while the unemployed Welsh international desperately talked-the-talk and improvised an accompanying walk, Lawrence refused to budge.  "Nathan Blake is not on my list. I don't want a club full of players in their 30s."  Just how first teamers Martyn Margetson (32), Gary Crofit (30), Tony Vidmar (34), John Robinson (32), Graham Kavanagh (30), Gareth Whalley (30) and Peter Thorne (30) react to this news remains to be seen.

      When not commenting on the daily goings on at Ninian Park or speculating on / creating idle transfer gossip, Bluebirds.tv spends its time, placard in hand and sandwich board over shoulders, advocating safe and sensible sunbathing now that summer is creeping upon us.  The three rules to live by are simple:  1. Use a high-factor sunblock 2. Always wear a baseball cap (full marks to the jobless pond life that hang around Bluebirds.tv towers and throw stones at the windows - they love number two!) 3. And, if you are out in the garden sunbathing, for goodness sake wrap a towel around your legs.  These suntan-avoiding techniques are faxed almost daily to Lennie’s office but it appears he hasn’t heeded the warnings and has come down with a bout of sunstroke. That is, unless, those cruel ‘Mad Lennie’ jibes have some substance after all.   “We are expected to reach the Premiership within two seasons”, he said, pausing for the nurse to feel his forehead and pop a thermometer in his mouth.  “Nobody, not even Sam, has said that to me but we have to earn promotion to the Premiership or be as close as you can in two seasons.”  "The new stadium will be growing before our eyes in the meantime and that will increase expectation for Cardiff City to take the next step.”  What? Work on the new stadium? Nurse! Come back!

      While Len Ashurst’s testimonial against Birmingham was nothing to write about, Bluebirds.tv is unduly concerned that, due to an uncontrollable need for liquid refreshment, missed Earnie’s winning goal shortly before half-time.  Forking out a tenner and missing the only goal of a dull and pointless match is neither here nor there to Bluebirds.tv, or that Lennie Lawrence may have cast an eye over veteran Jason Perry as a replacement for Spencer Prior. Bluebirds.tv is a little anxious, however, that it may have missed Robert Earnshaw’s last goal for the club if the Welsh tabloid rumour mill is to be believed.  On what was hopefully a slow news day, one media jockey decided to cause unrest in the Ninian Park bootcamp by regurgitating a week old story:  “Charlton Athletic are missing a prolific marksman - their top scorer in 2003-04 was Jason Euell with 10 - and Earnshaw could fit the bill.” the old hack wrote with the sound of a barrel bottom being scraped echoing in the background.  “And Curbishley fuelled speculation the 23-year-old could be on his way to SE7 by saying he expects to see several new faces at The Valley when his squad reassemble in July”  How can probably the most tenuous of links that could be created, i.e. Charlton expect to buy new players, and the sheer fact that Robert Earnshaw plays football, be described as 'fuelling speculation?'  Bluebirds.tv is more than aware that column inches need to be filled but couldn’t something a little more original be used? There is plenty to be written about the death of Welsh club rugby, especially since the Warriors have now gone to the wall.  Imagine all the valley folk who will readily be vox-popped and proclaim to be ‘devastated’ that another club has tragically died, yet the irony of never setting foot through the Brewery Field or Sardis Road turnstiles in their lives (if recent attendances are anything to go by) will be conveniently ignored?  That would be good for a laugh - expect the 16 page colour pull-out this weekend.  But even if the unthinkable happens: Earnie leaves the club and Bluebirds.tv has to find another player to sponsor and love like its own, contrary to last summer's transfer drought, there appear to be plenty of players literally begging for work at Fortress Ninian.  First up is centre-half Robert Page, current Welsh international and transfer-listed Sheffield United captain:   “If I had the chance I would definitely consider a move - it would be lovely” he said in a tone a little camper than his Rhondda heritage suggests.  "I believe I still have plenty to offer a Division One club".  Bluebirds.tv thinks so too, just not Cardiff.  Next up was Nathan Blake, the prodigal son of Ninian Park. Everyone remembers Blakey for his goal that dumped Premiership side Manchester City out of the FA Cup a decade ago, but the injury-plagued hitman has won an even greater accolade by becoming football’s biggest jinx by suffering five relegations with Sheffield United, Bolton, Blackburn, and this season, Wolves.  When City won promotion to Division One last season, Blake was heavily linked with a return to the club, but opted to try his luck in the Premiership. One goal in 13 appearances later, he was not offered a new contract.  “Of course Cardiff would appeal to me” the out-of-work striker said, “that goes without saying. But we'll wait and see.”  “I just want to play for another couple of seasons and try to win a trophy somewhere. Plus there’s loads of great amusement arcades in the City” he only partly added.  On the way out from the game, Bluebirds.tv witnessed one brazen street trader on Sloper Road flogging bootleg play-off T-shirts. Quite innocuous you may think, apart from they were for City’s 1-0 Millennium Stadium victory against QPR almost a year ago!  Unbelievably, 12 months on, fans can’t part with their hard-earned fast enough for these shoddily-produced keepsakes and as yet another punter crumpled a used fiver into the “street entrepreneur’s” greasy palm, Bluebirds.tv imagined the mobile telephone conversation he was having while accumulating a tidy tax-free sum.  “You were right, Phil (referring to legendary knock-off supplier ‘Phil the Greek’), these mugs will buy any old rubbish!  “Have you still got that other suitcase on the go ‘cos at this rate I’m gonna be empty by Saturday, innit?”  No conversation of this calibre would be complete without throwing in a well-timed “Next year Rodders...”, and with that Bluebirds.tv was ready for another pint.

      With no money to spend and four squad players (Mark Bonner, Jason Bowen and this week Gavin Gordan and Spencer Prior) shown the door, reinforcements are needed fast, and at bargain basement prices!  Bluebirds.tv is all too aware of the difficulties Cardiff City had attracting players to the club last season, so has taken the initiative to present Lennie Lawrence with a list of potential targets, one in each position, who are all available on free transfers.    Goalkeeper:  Andy Marriott  Marriott's arrival would please the "Only sign 'em if their Welsh" brigade at Ninian Park. The experienced keeper has clocked up over 300 appearances for Wrexham, Sunderland and Barnsley, and played in the Premiership for Birmingham (once). Would be a useful player in City's quest for European glory as he now possesses continental savvy following a spell with Portuguese outfit Beira Mar.   Alternatives : Perennial bench-warmer  Pegguy Arphexad  has played just 16 senior games in four seasons and being asked to keep goal rather than sit down and do nothing in exchange for wages may be expecting too much. Fatties such as  Roger Freestone  and  Kevin Pressman  are best avoided, while only the desperate would want  Gavin Ward  to return to Ninian Park 11 years after he departed for Leicester.  Left Back:  Danny Tiatto  Too good an opportunity to miss? Tiatto is a defender who can run at players and possesses the silky skills most wingers can only dream of. He also has a tendency to 'get stuck in', an attribute the City faithful regard higher than things like ability and is guaranteed at least one crowd pleasing red card per season. A current Australian international, he would probably link up well with Tony Vidmar who has been a revelation since signing from Middlesbrough last summer.   Alternatives : Forget about world class players such as Bayern Munich’s  Bixente Lizarazou ,  Christian Ziege  from Spurs, and Manchester City free-kick specialist  Michael Tarnat  signing for City.  Peter Kennedy , released by Wigan is a more likely option.  Right Back:  Curtis Fleming  The former Republic of Ireland international played in almost half of Crystal Palace's league games this season despite being 36 years of age. The full-back enjoyed an illustrious career at Middlesbrough and clocked up nearly 250 appearances in 10 seasons. Calling him ‘experienced’ would be an understatement and if signed on a one-year contract, he would provide valuable cover down the right and thankfully keep Rhys Weston away from first team duties for another season.    Alternatives : Surprisingly there is a shortage of right backs going for a song this summer, so it’s either Fleming or lower leaguers such as  George Abbey  (Macclesfield) and  Danny Boxall  (Brizzle Rovers) who should never be allowed to inflict themselves upon City's first team squad.  Centre Back:  Dion Dublin  A former City loan target who chose a temporary switch to Millwall over our fair capital, has been given the boot by Aston Villa. Now approaching the ‘veteran’ stage of his career, Dublin is squeezing a few more miles out of the tank by playing in defence. He has scored over 200 goals as a striker for the likes of Manchester United, Coventry City and of course Villa and would therefore also add some much-needed firepower to the squad.  Centre Back:  Jason De Vos  The perfect answer to Lennie’s plea for a “big and ugly” centre back. The 6’4” Canadian powerhouse was sent off twice this season and fits the bill as a player able to “knock people about”. De Vos has scored 15 goals in 87 league appearances for Wigan, mainly from set-pieces, something City have failed to capitalize on time and time again in recent years.   Alternatives : Dublin’s defensive partner at Villa,  Ronny Johnsen , has also been axed, while Sheffield United’s Welsh international  Robert Page  and Manchester City’s  Gerard Wiekens  have been given the chop. Former Derby defender  Taribo West  , 30 (but reported to be up to 10 years older), has been released by Partizan Belgrade but is more likely to be tempted by the retirement homes at Middlesbrough or Wolves. Norwich, Derby and Leicester seems a solid pedigree until you find out it’s  Spencer Prior  and Cardiff released him because he was crap and paid loads.  Left Winger:  Lionel Morgan  Once courted by Spurs for £750,000 but has seen his chances of a Premiership move wrecked by injury and is a victim of Wimbledon’s cost cutting measures. Undoubtedly talented and looking for a club to take a chance on him, it’s a similar tale to that of ex-Don Gareth Ainsworth. Bluebirds.tv doesn’t need to remind anybody of what a fan favourite he was at Ninian Park during his short stay at the business end of the 2002/03 season.   Alternatives : Former England internationals  Jason Wilcox  and  John Salako  have been released by Leeds and Reading but are both at least a decade older than Morgan.  Martin Phillips , the winger once predicted many moons ago by prehistoric manager Alan Ball to be the first £10 million English player has been booted out of Plymouth. But at 28 years of age he should be reaching his peak, such that it is.  Right Winger:  Darren Anderton  Bluebirds.tv is of the opinion that you need an occasional glamour signing. They give the fans optimism and renewed hope, but more importantly they divert their attention from the fact the club has no money and work still hasn’t begun on the proposed new stadium. At this level of football, signings don’t come much glitzier than Anderton. By his standards he has stayed injury-free this season and clocked up 20 league appearances plus three more in the Cups. The only stumbling block could be his wages and he’d have to take at least a 50% pay-cut on his reported £20,000 per week salary. However, he could be tempted with an appearance-related bonus package. “You see Mr Anderton, it’s like this. We will give you £X bonus and all you need to do to achieve that is play 23 league games…”. As long as the South Wales Echo isn’t available in North London (or he doesn’t share the same agent as Gareth Whalley), this plan may just be crazy enough to work.    Alternatives : Relegated Leicester no longer require the services of  Andy Impey , while  Terry  “I used to play for Manchester United”  Cooke  has been released by Sheffield Wednesday.  Central Midfielder:  Gareth Farrelly  A player who does the rounds in Division One and incredibly turned out for Burnley, Bradford and Wigan this season. Sooner or later Bluebirds.tv predicts he will end up at Ninian Park. As a left footer, he would add balance to central midfield and consign Gareth Whalley to being the reserve team’s highest earner on £6,000 per week. Capped six times by the Republic of Ireland, he would link up well with Graham Kavanagh.  Central Midfielder:  Mark Kinsella  A classy Ireland international with over 40 caps to his name, and given the choice of two, a better signing than Farrelly. Bluebirds.tv was disappointed City didn’t sign Kinsella when he was made available by Aston Villa and Midlands neighbours West Brom snapped him up until the end of the season. He made 15 starts for the Baggies, scoring one goal and would add strength and quality to City’s shaky midfield. Again the Irish connection with Graham Kavanagh could only be beneficial.  Sign him Lennie!    Alternatives : Many old-timers who fall into the ‘used to be good’ category have been handed their P45s this summer. Leeds hardman  David Batty , ex-Chelsea and Spurs goalscorer  Gustavo Poyet , Sheffield Wednesday’s  Robbie Mustoe  and Walsall deserter  Vinny Samways  are all available. Ex-City target  Paul McLaren  has been turfed out at Sheffield Wednesday while Richard Langley’s old midfield partner at QPR,  Stuart Wardley , has been released by Rushden & Diamonds.  Striker:  Paul Heffernan  Future Republic of Ireland star Heffernan enjoyed his best season yet, firing in 21 goals for relegated Notts County. Not relishing the prospect of dungeon football, he is not renewing his contract but at just 22-years-old, a transfer-scuppering compensation payment will be required.  Striker:  Delroy Facey  The former Huddersfield wonderkid didn’t get much of a look-in at either Bolton or West Brom, but scoring five goals in 12 starts on loan for struggling Burnley proves he can cut it at first division level. With Gavin Gordon shown the door and young Stuart Fleetwood not ready for a run in the side there is a requirement for a new striker and Bluebirds.tv thinks City could do a lot worse than Facey.   Alternatives : Welshman and one-time City target  Iwan Roberts , who made an International career for himself by coming on for the last five minutes of each game has been released by Norwich after seven years service.  Andy Liddell , another player released by Wigan is a viable target.  Georgi Hristov  didn’t find the womenfolk in Barnsley up to much so Bluebirds.tv dreads to think what he’ll make of the munters who frequent St. Mary’s Street each weekend. Only a crazy person would bank on a return to Ninian Park for either  Kevin Nugent  or  Paul Brayson , released by their respective clubs, Swansea and Cheltenham.

      Speculation is rife that Darren Carter, made famous by scoring  THE  penalty that sent Birmingham into the Premiership a couple of years ago is wanted at Ninian Park.  In return for bringing top flight and a realistic chance of European football to the city and luring class players like Christophe Dugarry and Matthew Upson to St. Andrews, as well as prologing Jamie Clapham's Premiership career, young Carter has barely kicked a ball for the club since and is keen on a season-long loan move.  "I would definitely be up for a loan move to Cardiff" pleaded Carter before referring to his copy of  Stock Responses to Talk Up Prospective Employers :  "Big club...." blah blah blah.... "sure they will be challenging for promotion next season..." heard it all before... "great fan-base..." but of course... and end with the standard line of "always hearing good things about a club which has Premiership ambitions...".  "Plus, I scored a penalty once" he may or may not have added.  Andy Campbell, who could be concerned for his position as City's one-trick pony, was unavailable for comment.

      Bluebirds.tv was cordially invited to last night's sponsors bash and while not  particularly interested in watching a sullen-faced Gareth Whalley posing for photographs with Gromitt & Sons Ltd, attending the draw for 2004-05 player sponsorship was top of the evening's priorities.  To prevent certain companies from monopolising the best players by continuing their sponsorship year-in-year-out and leaving the rest to scrap over reserves and youngsters, some clever dick in Marketing decided an exciting 'FA Cup Third Round' style draw was the way forward, with players names and prospective sponsors being drawn together at random.  With an away kit sponsorship for any of the 25 first-team squad on the horizon, Bluebirds.tv felt like a damp-knickered teenager at a Westlife concert as the names were drawn out of the hat.  "Chris Barker", "Arran Lee Barrett", the rollcall began. Phew, at least we didn't get lumbered with the third choice keeper. "Peter Thorne"... shit! Bluebirds.tv grimaced as it saw the 25/1 shot that was sponsoring Thorney go down the pan.  And so the draw went on. Classy first team players that Bluebirds.tv would quite happily be associated with were read out much to the delight of other sponsors: "Richard Langley", "Tony Vidmar", "Danny Gabbidon".  Then IT happened. ' Robert Earnshaw '.  Fuelled by alcohol and the smugness that goes with the knowledge that other sponsors have played this game for years and have never pulled off a coup this large, Bluebirds.tv let out a huge cheer that caught the room's full attention.  After the draw was completed, old man Lennie (Lawrence) commented on how happy certain sponsors were with their respective players, but added fuel to the raging inferno that is Eanshaw's Ninian Park future by hinting that  certain  players may be plying their considerably talented trade elsewhere before kick off in August.  "But we'll be signing a third string keeper so you'll be alright" he joked, momentarily glancing up from his bumper book of well spun yarns to look in Bluebirds.tv's direction.  While Arran Lee Barrett made that all important phone call to his agent, Bluebirds.tv took another gulp of watery-tasting Fosters and asked outrightly: "Dropping any hints there Lennie?"  "No, no", was the nervous reply that came out of his mouth faster than Leslie Grantham can log into a webcam-enabled chatroom, so Bluebirds.tv (and in all likelihood Cardiff City) is still none the wiser on the little fella's future.  But now is not the time to worry about such matters. Bluebirds.tv has made THE corporate signing of the summer. Bar none. Well, maybe apart from Thorney.  So here we are. A new website. Robert Earnshaw and another season of (the Football League's) top flight football. Roll on August....

      After speculation regarding Robert Earnshaw’s future had all but died down after the press had exhausted the list of clubs to link him with, like a bad case of herpes, the rumours refuse to go away.  Charlton signed Darren Bent and Birmingham landed Emile Heskey, thus ruling out the need for Earnie’s services, while Fulham and Celtic distanced themselves from a move for the pint-sized striker.  But now a strong link to Everton has emerged and this one looks the real deal. Rumours that Wayne Rooney is about to head off to Manchester United for £20 million plus will mean there is money to spend, and with that sort of cash available, Earnshaw’s £3 million-up-front-with-more-to-follow price tag is unlikely to scare off the suits at Goodison Park.  Ominously, manager Lennie Lawrence was yesterday quoted as saying in one Sunday newspaper "There is something brewing” and he was not talking about Arran Lee Barrett making the tea at Ninian Park, “the talk surrounding Earnshaw is very strong”.  Plus, all incoming transfers are to be put on ice until Earnie’s future is resolved. Does this mean there is no money to spend unless he moves on, and, more importantly, if this is the case, just who on earth will Bluebirds.tv be providing the away kit for next season?   More is expected to be revealed by Wednesday.  Some better news is City have officially made their first signing of the season by securing the permanent transfer of Lee Bullock.  "I know that players such as Graham Kavanagh and Willie Boland will probably be starting the season ahead of me in the pecking order," shrugged Bullock. "But it's up to me to force myself into the first team.  With no further signings on the horizon, Richard Langley fannying about with Jamaica in August and if Kav suffers with injuries like he did last season, then Bullock may have a longer run in the side than he first anticipated.

      Not at all Cardiff-related, but Bluebirds.tv simply has to comment on tonight’s Engerlund vs ‘Johnny Foreigner’ match.  The usual xenophobic dross about ‘Bulldog Spirit’ and foreign teams not liking it ‘up em’ was yet again trotted out in 16 page colour pullouts backed up by tenuous justification as to how an over-rated manager like Sven Goran Eriksson can take an under-achieving, done nothing side like England to European glory.  Just watching those smug morons in the stands who couldn’t tell one end of a bayonet from another, singing the theme tune to the ‘Great Escape’ and stretching their arms out as if they were Jan Aage Fjortoft in a ‘patriotic’ rendition of the Dambusters, needed something spectacular right at the end to wipe the smirks clean off their beer-stained faces, following a seemingly winning Frank Lampard goal.  And boy did they get it.

      The first update in over a week and not much has changed. The stadium is still in the ‘planning’ stage, Lee Bullock is still swanning about in Florida and yet to sign a permanent deal, and surprise, surprise, Robert Earnshaw is still very much a Cardiff City player.  The press, the ink and paper version of a dog chewing an extremely gristly bone, will stop at nothing to link little Earnie with a move anywhere, as long as it’s not Ninian Park.  The stories have become so desperate since no firm bids, official enquires or even casual chats with Sam over a pint of Dark and a bowl of sheep’s testicles, have been made. What constitutes as ‘news’ these days are tedious ‘almost signed for’ non-stories which carry about as much substance as an O.J. Simpson case for defence.  This week Earnie ‘nearly’ became a Birmingham City player. Given the option of a proven goalscorer at domestic and international level, Steve Bruce spent £6 million on Emile Heskey instead, but without even querying Earnshaw’s availability or asking price, how exactly does a ‘nearly’ transfer work?  Is it similar to Rivaldo ‘nearly’ signing for Tottenham, or Lennie ‘nearly’ deploying a tactic other than the ‘high ball up to the little fella’?  It’s never going to happen. It’s pure fantasy.  Until a rival Chairman strolls into Ninian Park with a briefcase containing at least £5 million in used currency, Robert Earnshaw is going nowhere and Bluebirds.tv will proudly sponsor the brightest talent to wear the shirt in the last decade when the first ball is kicked in August.  City made their first summer signing today by taking 16-year-old goalkeeper Scott Allison on a year’s work experience from York. With Arran Lee-Barrett likely to be farmed out to some god-awful dungeon side next season, the tea still needs to be made and Thorney told how wonderful he is on a daily basis.  The club’s listing in Ad Trader worked a treat and Gavin Gordon has fixed himself up with a new club for next season. Notts County warmed to the ‘Offered: goal-shy useless lump, sorry, ‘target man’ available – free to a good home’ advert and promptly offered the former Lincoln man a contract.  Hopefully Gordon can recapture the form that saw him net five goals (yes, in one game) against Rushden a few years ago, and Bluebirds.tv wishes him the best of luck.  Confirmed speculation regarding transfers into Ninian Park have been few and far between. Lennie has confirmed his desire to bring Wales dinosaur Robert Page in to warm the bench, but other names have recently surfaced, Mansfield’s Liam Lawrence and out-of-contract Danny Tiatto.  Australian international Tiatto was touted on Bluebirds.tv weeks ago as a possible signing but as yet no official approach has been made to secure the former Manchester City winger’s services, according to Danny’s brother and agent, Frank – the poor man’s Claude Anelka.  A move for Tiatto is unlikely, due to the player entering his fourth decade and taking into account his colourful disciplinary record. Plus, in a City midfield already devoid of imagination in Kavanagh’s absence, another huff-and-puff player should not be a top priority.    "I may not be the most creative player” Tiatto snarled, “but what I lack in that aspect, I make up for with heart and soul”  Roughly translated as “I make up for general crapness by kicking lumps out of the opposition”, a quality that may endear him to Ninian Park supporters still pining for Gareth Stoker and his ‘unique’ style of play.  However, serving a third ban of the season and pocketing around £10k a week in the process for doing sod all is bound to grate on even the most gladiatorial City fan.

      After weeks of endless speculation linking Bluebirds.tv’s Robert Earnshaw to every second rate Premiership club in need of a striker, it makes a change to comment on some incoming transfers.  Welsh international Robert Page replaces Spencer Prior as the defender trying to break up the partnership of James Collins and Gabbs at the centre of defence, while Tony Warner’s arrival has relegated Neil Alexander to third choice.  These are two solid transfers which will undoubtedly strengthen the squad overall, as well of course as the permanent signing of goalscoring midfielder Lee Bullock.  Lawrence hopes these signings will silence critics who complained about the lack of transfers but Bluebirds.tv still doesn’t think these three alone will be enough for the big promotion push that Sam Hammam desperately wants and the play-off spot Lennie hopes to achieve.  The newly named (and quite aptly) Championship is looking very strong in the run-up to it’s first season and whereas these signings are positive, City will need further signings just to maintain May’s final position as a mid-table club.  But if transfer news is thin on the ground, you can always do what Lennie does, and simply make some up.  "We have effectively signed six players in the last 48 hours." said Lawrence unconvincingly, making up for the lack of transfer activity with fictional signings.   Of course he was referring to players signing new contracts and praising those coming back from injury. But just how mainstays Martyn Margetson and Gary Croft signing new deals or the fact that Kav and Thorney may remain free from injury long enough to play a bit of football next season counts as signing new players is still something Bluebirds.tv is trying to work out.  The arrival of 6 foot 5 goalkeeper Tony Warner is good news as far as Bluebirds.tv is concerned, because we may now have somebody who can dominate the box, but it spells the end for Neil Alexander’s City career.    “Scotland’s… Number One… Scotland’s, Scotland’s, Number One” as he was affectionately known as at Ninian Park has now become City’s number three, or even four if Arran Lee Barrett has anything to do with it.  "It doesn't look good for me at Cardiff” said Alexander, stating the bleeding obvious, “I thought I would be trying to win my place back from Martyn next season.”  The player, who has not started a league game since December doesn’t have much to look forward to next season, apart from sitting on the bench in the FAW Premier Cup and is likely to move away or at least go out on loan.   “It's not that easy to find a new club” he explained, “not many clubs are looking for a new goalkeeper, especially one that concedes 14 goals in five games" he only partly added.  The defensive third is looking a lot stronger in view of the forthcoming season and there could be more reinforcements on the way with Sean Gregan of WBA, Celtic’s Jamie Smith and Birmingham loan target Darren Carter still being linked strongly.

      City fans were subjected to one of their team’s worst performances of all last season when Coventry visited Ninian Park in March.  Down to 10 men after just three minutes following Peter Clarke’s dismissal, Coventry stunned City in the 71st minute with a penalty from Gary McShefferty, and against the lacklustre Bluebirds, this was enough to win the match.  City have a lot to prove in this match and will want revenge, but defensive frailty casts a doubt on whether they can beat the Sky Blues.  Lennie Lawrence is not convinced James Collins is the answer at the back, while midfielder Willie Boland and striker Peter Thorne will be missing again with hip and neck injuries.  Coventry have started the season well, winning 2-0 against Sunderland on Saturday evening and they will be confident of taking something from the game at Ninian Park.   Likely City lineup:  Margetson, Weston, Gabbidon, Page, Vidmar, Kavanagh, Langley, Robinson, Bullock, Earnshaw, Lee.  Substitutes:  Campebell, Croft, Collins, Parry, Warner.

      City managed to snatch a late draw when victory looked certain with five minutes left on the clock.  Goals from John Robinson and Alan Lee overturned Crewe’s 1-0 lead, coming from a Dean Ashton penalty after just five minutes.  But the usual policy of easing off trying to preserve a lead, rather than going for the jugular, allowed Mike Higdon to volley in an equaliser.  Bluebirds.tv cannot be too disappointed with the result, since City were fortunate to have all 11-players on the field, after Tony Vidmar appeared to handle the ball on the goal line – the offence for which Crewe’s early penalty was given.  After the game, Lennie Lawrence bemoaned a penalty not awarded to his side after Robert Earnshaw went down to a Steve Foster tackle on 65 minutes.  But events such as these usually crop up in football and cancel eachother out so a draw on the opening game of the season was probably a fair result.  City now face a tricky match against Coventry City, who beat promotion hopefuls Sunderland 2-0 on Saturday.

      The purpose of this column is to see if betting on matches that Cardiff City are involved in can be a profitable, rather than a frustrating experience.  Before each game a betting preview on City’s latest match will appear here along with a recommended stake. After approximately 50 matches an accurate reflection of whether your hard earned should be spent paying off your bookie’s holiday home in the Bahamas or on tea for the kids.  And so for Saturday….   Crewe Alexandra vs Cardiff City   City have a good record at Gresty Road in recent seasons, winning 1-0 last term and earning a goalless draw on the final game of the promotion winning campaign.  Plus, the Bluebirds have an excellent record for opening games of the season, winning four and drawing five in the last nine years. They are capable of taking something from the game they are expected to win in what promises to be a tough season.  The only injury concern of note Danny Gabbidon, who is trying to shake off a heel injury, but the impressive Robert Page should start in defence. Alan Lee is likely to partner Robert Earnshaw up front, while Willie Boland and Peter Thorne may also feature in the squad.  Mark Rivers has returned to Crewe following a spell at Norwich, but manager Dario Gradi has lost midfield lynchpin Dave Brammer to Stoke, while David Wright has departed for Wigan.  The odds on a Cardiff win are appealing, but since it’s the first game, it is advisable to keep the stakes small.

      Kick off against Crewe is still 48 hours away, but it is never too early to speculate on who will play in City’s opening game. If Gabbidon does not recover from a knock then Bluebirds.tv’s preferred starting line-up is as follows:   Martyn Margetson  The only keeper worth considering at present but “Wales’ Number One” deserves his place in the team on merit. An ever-present in the starting line up since Christmas, he will take some shifting.   Gary Croft  Out of favour against Lazio but the steady full-back can fill in down the left side while the preferred Vidmar moves into the middle.   Tony Vidmar  Possibly the best signing of all last season, veteran defender Vidmar is a cultured player who is best at full back, but can slot into the centre when required.   Robert Page  A better player than Bluebirds.tv game him credit, Page was excellent during the Santander and Lazio matches. However, he lacks a bit of pace and needs to play alongside somebody quick to form an effective partnership. A Page / Collins partnership is unlikely to work.   Rhys Weston  Played the full 90 minutes against Lazio and put in a solid performance. His attacking ability will be needed on Saturday in a must-win first game. If only he could defend the Gary Croft’s days would be numbered.   Richard Langley  Looked confident against Lazio and was eager to be involved in every attack, rather than last season’s usual trick of hiding out on the wing and giving the ball away whenever it came near him.   Lee Bullock  After replacing the injured Willie Boland early on the Santander game, Bullock was keen to show he could mix it against top flight players. Another commanding midfield performance against Lazio followed, even outshining Kavanagh means he must get the nod on Saturday.   Graham Kavanagh (C)  The captain looked subdued in the last two friendlies but perhaps he didn’t want to risk another injury before the season begins? He has the ability to boss the midfield at this level and will be a key to opening day success.   John Robinson  Never stops working and tries to inspire confidence in his team-mates at every opportunity. His passion for the game is unquestionable but starting two fights in the last two friendly games mean his dodgy legs won’t be the only reason for him to come off early.   Alan Lee  His tendency to get ‘stuck in’ shocked Lazio and he was rewarded with the match’s opening goal, his first in about 100 or so City appearances. A goal on Saturday would do wonders for his confidence after a dry spell last season.   Robert Earnshaw  If Earnie can recreate the form he showed at the start of last season, the Bluebirds will be challenging for promotion early on. But as City fans are all too aware, he cannot do it all on his own.   Substitutes:    Peter Thorne  Didn’t look fit against Racing Santander and wasn’t even in the squad to face Lazio.   Willie Boland  Loses out to the outstanding Lee Bullock in midfield, but if City require more steel in the middle of the pitch, Boland is the man to call upon.   Paul Parry  Has certainly made the grade since joining from Conference side Hereford, but will start the season behind a rejuvenated Richard Langley.   James Collins  Has done nothing wrong to warrant not being in the side, but a player of his tender years does not need the pressure of playing each game now Page has been signed.   Arran Lee Barrett  Outstanding performances in between the sticks for the Keltic Kids sees the 20-year-old find himself on the bench ahead of Tony Warner and Neil Alexander.

      Call it an act of sheer favouritism, but Bluebirds.tv could not begin this latest instalment without championing Robert Earnshaw and  that goal  in last night’s gallant 3-2 defeat against Lazio.  Following a barren spell towards the end of last season, it was encouraging to see Earnie has regained his goalscoring touch going into the new season, and has both the belief and skill to do it in style.  Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the match was not Rhys Weston getting a game and playing reasonably well, but watching Lennie Lawrence becoming animated on the touchline, something Bluebirds.tv had often thought was the stuff of legend.  When City were in full flow during the first half, Ninian Park’s stone-age gaffer was getting quite worked up and yelling at his players. For perhaps the first time ever, Denver the Last Dinosaur was replaced by Captain Caveman.  Lennie had stated this week that City “wouldn’t be pushed around” this season and this belief clearly extended to the sidelines. A large stack of water bottles had even been placed within kicking distance for added effect should the rage become unbearable.  Unbelievably, City lead at half-time 1-0, courtesy of a rare goal from Alan Lee.  Bar Earnshaw’s wonder goal, the second half performance was similar to that played out time and time again last season and plenty before that. Same old City. A side devoid of ideas and lacking a cutting edge.  Bluebirds.tv cannot really complain that City failed to beat the side which won the Scudetto four years ago, but Lazio were there for the taking in the first half.  However, the Italians stepped up a gear in the second and City had no answer to it. The same thing happens every other week at Ninian Park, whether the Bluebirds are up against world beaters or the League equivalent of the ‘Dog & Duck’. But the question is simple. Why?  “Our problem is getting caught on the break, which shows up a lack of pace”, said Lennie, double checking the dryness of the ink on Robert Page’s contract and scrambling around for the receipt.  “I’m glad we are away on day one because defending at home we are daydreaming”. Hardly words of inspiration just days before the trip to Crewe, a team Cardiff are expected to beat in what has been built up as a ‘play-off push’ this season.  Thoughts of horses and stable doors spring to mind. This is a problem City have had for months, if not seasons. Just exactly WHAT have the players been practicing this summer?  The ‘long ball up to the little fella’ tactic? Because that always works…..  One training exercise that has been skipped is goalkeeping if Tony Warner’s calamitous performance was anything to go by. In all fairness to the ex-Millwall stopper, he couldn’t have done much about the first goal and probably didn’t even see the second fly past him, but the third?  A sliced clearance into the Grandstand set up another Lazio attack and allowed the ancient Roberto Muzzi to smack a hopeful, head-height shot straight at Warner from about 25 yards.  Bread and butter you may think for a goalkeeper who can boast Liverpool and Celtic as former employers, but instead of catching the ball or tipping it over the bar, Warner flapped at it in a manner that made Peter Zois look competent and scooped the ball over his head and into the net.  Neil Alexander may soon have a new friend to keep him company.  Bluebirds.tv had hoped this moment of sheer crapness would goad Lennie into sticking his size 9s through the water bottle stack, but Denver had clearly returned and instead he just stood there, leaning against an imaginary lamppost.  The taxi will be along any minute.

      As far as Bluebirds.tv is concerned, Saturday was what pre-season football is all about – drinking in the sun all afternoon, watching the game without worrying about the final score, and then comparing sun burn at the end of 90 minutes.  This was Bluebirds.tv’s first friendly outing of the summer, having not travelled to footballing outposts such as Yeovil or Cheltenham, preferring the sanctuary of Ninian Park and taking advantage of the “two for £15” ticket offer like a bargain-happy Matalan shopper.  After failing to win any of the three pre-season matches thus far, and conceding goals with a regularity that saw keeper Neil Alexander slump to fourth choice, victory against Real Racing Club Santander would have been a welcome tonic.  But it wasn’t to be. The sweltering heat seemed to hinder the City players and meant for a dull first half. Willie Boland was unlucky to put the ball into his own net to give the Spaniards the lead but Andy Campbell should have been awarded a penalty after being clattered in the box by the keeper, but only a free kick was awarded.  The second half was better and provided at least some value for money. Throughout the game Santander lived up to their Primera Liga stereotype and pushed, pulled and fouled their way through the match. But one player made the wrong decision targeting City’s ‘Mr Angry’ John Robinson and one niggly challenge resulted in a free-for-all involving both sets of players and even those in the dug-outs. Pantomime season at Ninian Park, four months early!  In one great display of comic acting, a Santander player clattered Paul Parry and just as he was about to be booked ran toward and went over the Welsh international in a desperate attempt to save himself. Either that, or he slipped on the half a pint of grease that emanated from his person.  With a preferred starting line-up in mind for Crewe next weekend, a couple of other players battled their way into contention.   Andy Campbell . The £900,000 striker is clearly enjoying this pre-season and played the entire 90 minutes. He looked lively throughout and more like the player that scored all those goals while on loan from Middlesbrough three years ago. Lennie must be gearing him up to play a bigger role this season by giving him an extended run in the friendlies.   Lee Bullock . Came on as an early substitute for the injured Willie Boland and played very well. Didn’t look out of place alongside Graham Kavanagh and was unlucky not to equalise with a header that had the Santander keeper beaten.   Alan Lee . Was more effective than Peter Thorne and tormented the Santander defence with his runs down the channels. Should have had a penalty after being pulled back in the box.  If Boland doesn’t recover from injury in time this is how Bluebirds.tv hopes City will line up against Crewe, although things could change after Monday’s glamour fixture against Lazio:  Margetson, Croft, Gabbidon, Page, Vidmar, Robinson, Kavanagh, Bullock, Parry, Earnshaw, Thorne.  Subs:  Warner, Collins, Langley, Campbell, Lee.
