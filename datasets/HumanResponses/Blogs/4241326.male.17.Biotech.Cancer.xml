      alas, jiafeng called me at 12 plus. wow, how early is that.. anyway, we decided to meet at  SYC  at 3.30pm. just nice i thought, and i am able to take an hour nap before journeying there. maybe i'm not so used to waking up so early yet, my exhaustion surprised me for it caused me to over-sleep. i woke up at three! thanks to  jiafeng  calling me; well, not so much a wake-up call but merely a call to ask where i was because i had not replied his sms. even he himself had not left his house, lucky, i thought or else nothing would spare me a horrendous scolding(would he  dare  scold me? hehee..). anyway, i immediately changed and prepared myself. without fail, when i got on the bus and had found myself a seat, i'd set aside my bag(s) and start reading my novel. while the bus was travelling through Thomsom Rd,  jiafeng  sms-ed me again. well, he had gone home to get his  chanting beads  while i suddenly remembered that i'd forgotten to bring along as well.  shit, i had to go without it i guess.  and i digged into my reading again until i've reached Harbourfront where i alight and hop on to another bus to reach  SYC . again, i started readin again til i reach  SYC...  while in the  SYC , we studied Cell Bio together. I, having started first, was a chapter ahead of him. would you think we'd do just pure studying? heehehe.. make a guess, u might be right. we did have pen fights in between.  URGH!!  i had ugly pen marks on my arms. never mind, so does he. =) anyway, the soon-ending study session ended at 7++pm and my stomach had already started groaning. we flew to the opposite food court and ate there.  jiafeng  so sweet leh.. he treat me to e duck rice and sugarcane juice and that i'm going to give him more pen marks. =P after that, we went back to  SYC  for the  SD  meeting. i was still familiar with none of the people there, so i kept to myself periodically. well, i'm such a shy person, don't you know that? *blush* the meeting ended at 9++pm and i was quite tired already, being the fact that i'd woken up at 8am. i went home alone, because nobody stayed in Ang Mo Kio(well,  John, Kenneth, and Terry  did accompany me to Harbourfront before they took trains there.) i read and slept on the bus and by the time i've reach home, i was feeling refreshed again. and i log online and chat with my friends until 1am when i began to revise CB again until 2am. i sought to revise another chapter before going to sleep but the attempt failed. thus am i blogging now before my sleep. BYE!

      i had such a wonderful sleep last night, which would rarely occur. i was home at around 11pm and i was so damn freaking tired that i threw myself at the bed immediately, not forgetting that  i had not bathe! i reminded myself that i need to wash up or else my rashes will come out. However, i still fell asleep anyway. Can't help it.. when i woke up, it's already eight in the morning, and i feel so afresh! O_O!! with no more hesitation, i stood up with ease (as compared to last time when i always have to pull myself up of bed) and went to do my morning routine. after which i had breakfast(only hams. sad, but i've found out there is no bread in my house after the hams were baked) and while enjoying the delicacies(well, have to hallucinate to arouse my appetite), i was revising Cell Bio. I don't know if my method of revision is correct or not. basically, i'm just summarising the lecture notes points on a paper. i hope this works for me, because i can find no way that proves to be a better one. on the other hand, it's quite a time-consuming method. nobody would have guessed, revision of a very simple topic would take me 2 hours. by this rate, when would i finish my revision?? blogging after revision happens to be a break for me; to relax, to express my opinions to anonymous persons... after that, i think i'll go have a short nap while waiting for  jiafeng  to call (he and i are meeting to study..). later folks..

      It started all with the chalet. I haven't had enough sleep after that (well, when did I  ever  had enough sleep?) I had been spending much of my time studying after the chalet, when had I become such a hardworking nerd, I'll never know I guess. . look at the time now.. Its already 3am and I'm still blogging?! Oh my, had I lost my mind. Maybe, due to the seemingly never-ending revision I think. I've just finished the second-last chapter of what will be tested and I'm taken a break now. I think I've taken too much breaks already, but who cares; blame it on my poor concentration level then. hehe.. my father's in the living room watching the Olympics; he'd seen me endlessly walking out of my room to kitchen for a water-break and then slacking in the living room to catch a few glimpse of the show before crawling back to my torturing revision. well, one more chapter to go.... Come on,  I CAN DO IT , cant I?? haiz.. Later..

       hee.. Interesting.. Started to blog only today.. Well, I wasn't even a wee bit interested in blogging a few moons ago.. I was thinking that blogging would be such a doric and boring stuff to do; a waste of time. However, as I come across much of my friends' blogs, well, as u can guess, it arouse the desire to express myself in me. Hence, thus my legend began...
