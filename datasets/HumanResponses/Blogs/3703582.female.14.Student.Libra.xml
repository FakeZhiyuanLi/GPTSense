       urlLink The Tongue Untied: Table of Contents    This is the best Grammar page I've found, it's for a university class I think. Good source to keep that mind up and running while on summer vacation!   Yes, I could have done without the corny-ness

      I absolutely refuse to ever, Ever, EVER again put off people or things concerning other people as long as I live! Why? Because it can have bad consequences and I beat myself up over shit in other peoples lives.  I think I'm a nice person, in fact, maybe I'm over nice. I can't hurt people purposely (unless your my sister or have annoyed me until my anger genes spark up) but I feel like I basically have hurt someone if I've failed to fix their problem or at least attempt to fix their problem, you know?  I feel guilty for things I have no part in. But those who had part in it don't care. Maybe I'm just trying to correct the mistakes of people who I don't know, too?  I'm trying to get everyone's links right now placed over there. If you email me I'm more likely to get you there than right now.  My mind is skippy.   I'll probably post later. I'm not even suppose to be on here...

      A southern wind moves through the trees Sunlight breaks over the hill and cascades light across the yard Time stands still I wonder if this will happen again Exactly so A squirrel moves And life begins again I listen to the noise inside the house Glance to the road A road can go so many places Out here it can go so deep into the wilderness I could step unto that road And walk away from this Leave this storm to wreck itself And not harm me Ever again It's possible to wade through the storm To survive, of course Stepping onto the road would be an easy escape (A cowardice way out) I think I deserve the easy for once But my pride and God deny it.

       I'll say it again...I miss  him . I'll say it until I can't. Because I miss  him . It's really odd because I've gotten to where I don't care really but then there are things that bring this on...   Sid was on webcam a second ago... He  did that once for me and I dunno why that was just fun and whenever I watch anyone's I think about that.  He  is such a wonderful person but just has so many problems and that just hurt to watch. I've heard a term used for a disaster that goes "It's like watching a train wreck." That pretty much sums up watching someone you care about, and would die for if ever in such a situation, continue to screw up their life ... almost purposely and not even give a shit.   I have to wonder what would have happened if  he  hadn't. Where would I be? Would I be here? Of course not. I'm too incredibly stupid to have not killed myself. Well, having faith in God I'd like to believe I would be alive...I just don't know. There are things that happened because of  him  being a part of my life. And certainly things that didn't. I need to stop contemplating would-have-beens. It gives me a head ache.    And that  person  I mentioned in my last blog. He's good right now. I hope. because what I did yesterday may have me banned from everything for a while if my sister mouths.   I just redid my HumanForSale...I've gone up! To $1,887,246.00! Somehow!   Bye folks.

      Well, I'm back...and using Blogger because I'm to finking lazy to fix that stupid php script I finked up.  For a while now I've put off getting to know this person who I know I would have a lot in common with. Now that person is having a crisis that I think I could help with BUT I'm not close enough to do anything now. So I'm feeling super crappy about that.  Oh, well, I'm going to add my PHPCurrent thing to the sidebar and that's about it right now.  Thanks for stopping by.  (PS: to everyone who I host, sorry that I haven't been a greatly interactive host. :-\)

          KICK ME...   I'M A IDIOT.     So my blog wasn't working because I deleted half the html template. GO FIGURE.  For the past few days I have been moving  urlLink SAFE's website . I volunteered for SAFE at the end of May and have done mainly web related things and gave my opinions and ideas. At Saving Antiquities For Everyone, we're commited to the preservation of cultural heritage and the stopping of looting of historical artifacts through public awareness.  In October we're having this big benefit in New York with John Russell, who was the Senior Advisor to the Cultural Ministry of the CPA in Iraq (yes, I copied and pasted that part.) So, they want me to do this video thing... We're doing a lot of simutaneous parties all over the world, hsoted by other members, but I can't do that...especially if it's my birthday weekend. I WILL have SOMETHING I at least want to do this year. They want me to talk about why I want to member of SAFE and about my love of hostoryu and any questions I have for Mr. Russell, etc etc.   WELL   1. Mom wants me to stop the SAFE thing.  She thinks that this woman caling me is a bad thing and that me doing somethinf FOR FREE is a bad thing. AS OF NOW, I WOULD LIKE OT STATE: I refuse to un-join. But this would make video thing complicated to pull off...  2. I am SOCIAL PHOBIC and my problem is what people think about how I look, etc. I jus decided I would do a photo for the website....but..but..a video?  -shrugs, then dies-   I really bring this all up because today Mrs. Cindy called about an e-mail I sent her because my crimson-light.net e-mail went down. Well, amid this conversation, on the other end of the house, my parents started fighting and cussing each other. AND THEM, BEING THEMSELVES, DID IT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD. They sounded like they were standing BEHIND me yelling at each other. Now, who wants to bet that the reason Cindy stopped talking mid sentence, right when my parents got their loudest and started using the "F" word, that she heard them?  -dies, yet again-    I'm going to aplogize for anything she may have heard in the background today in my next e-mail.        Well, I am plugging  urlLink CHRIS , who has been super nice and let me talk to him about this a bit and is a pretty good writer. Check out his Xanga, there. It's mainly writing, but it's good.

        Just because she deserves an entire post devoted to her.        JeNnIeH89: want me to call? o.0   EmiliEMariE08: hehe. might be fun to see dad actually breathe fire.. he'd be like one of those rotund little cartoon characters that their ears get all red and big and smoke comes out hehehe. enjoying that image.    Ok, I wasn't going to blog tonight but I changed my mind. I have to respond to the following comment from Emilie, then I have to sob some....       .....If I have ever suffered or wanted for anything if I had to do that so I could have you in my life Jen, I would. I know that sounds incredibly gay but it's true. I think you're probably one of the few people I'm not friends with because I have to be. It's voluntary. I would rather have you as my only friend and no one else than have everyone else (ever) and not you. seriously. ...    I just want to know what I did to really deserve that? Being in the mood I am in, and have been in for the past few days, I think that I deserve anything in compensation for my life but I know that's not completely true. If anything, I at least don't deserve what she said. I don't deserve her to care that much and mean it. And I especially don't deserve to even know Emilie Marie V.. .... I'm trying to some up with something that can even half compete with that but I can't. So, I'm going to say that Em is the bestest friend I have ever had. She deserves the world and I wish I could give her that, or at least a book deal.    I love ya Em. Stay brunette and awesome. Feel free to Space all ya want. LOL.

      I'm listening to Ruby and Max on Nickalodean. I like this show. They have nice music...Cute bunnies...And only Ruby talks most the time and it's real slow so I can keep up.  Yes. I'm losing my mind. But you can't deny that it's just a cute show.   I'll change it to MTV2 or Fuse in a second. Wonder if Nirvana is on somewhere.

      More thinking.  Yes, I am not at the doctor right now but my pants are washing...yes I didn't have pants. Now I could have gone to the doctor like that but......yeah.     I was thinking how  urlLink Libby  is a good friend. And how her comment was very correct. We go through all this shit to be better people. To be able to deal with future problems...I have a theory the problems will get worse, maybe less frequent, but harder to deal with.  I assume this means that I  (small interuption - --cut this because I changed my opinion--)   am going to face some tough shit in my life.    Yes, I cussed. But  urlLink Libby  did first!

      I was standing in the shower this morning...thinking about something Emilie said. About how if we'd been neighbors she and Natalie would have been best friends and she and I would be enemies.  Thinking on this it would serve to think I would also be a happy, preppy cheerleader by now; i'd have also died my hair blonde instead of dark brown (which isn't far from my original shade, anyway.)  As this thought crossed my mind you can imagine that I, Jennie Harris, poet, anti-labels and people who fit them, Christian, was quite, quite disgusted with myself. Than again, my daddy would have never hit me to hard as a child and in fact, my mommy and daddy would still love each other. My daddy would own his own buisness dealing with Oil exports and mommy would be a happy homemaker.  Natalie would have directed her amazing talent of story telling (which she does have) onto paper. We'd all go to church on Sundays and Wednesdays and if possible everyday in between and be a happy, loving, Godly family.   Oh, and I'd be super skinny.      Where did my parents go wrong?       Why is life so unfair?

      New Layout. Can we say "w00t"?  I likes it. The photo is from  urlLink Aaricia , it's entitled   urlLink The Child is Gone .  It's purdy, no? I finished a layout for  urlLink Em 's blog, if I don't decide I hate it. But I'm not ganna put it up until she gets back or I speak to her over the phone about it.   urlLink Emilie  is gone to gulf port.  Yay!  *sarcasm* I know she may be upset by this later;  I don't miss her (that much .) I mean, I do wish she was here, but I'm not totally, dreadfully alone like I could be (or like I was on my trip south.) Which reminds me, I opened a  urlLink Xanga . It's for my poetry and "eloquent" prose. (My short shorts that sound like poetry in paragraphs.) Em opened her one, too, but I think she really just wanted to comment on  urlLink Micah 's blog.  Even though I am mildly upset by  urlLink SP Quill 's revision of my  x . shh...a heartbeat.x  I think I will submit to them again. Really, why shouldn't I? Just be sure to note that I request something stay Italic or Bold and I should be fine. Now that I have finally memorized the proper use of a semicolon I am using it where ever possible. Oh, and I'm listed on  urlLink this page  for my submission  (under Quill Poetry).  w00tness. I can't believe they published it for some reason. But they did and I think they will publish more of my stuff if I go for it.  Did I mention I was sick? I'm had something that started to get bad Thursday but it's better today. Mom has it too but here is has been worse and she went to the doctor for it. He last few days she's been as sick as I was yesterday but I didn't feel I had to go to the doctor. I have a good (young) immune system.  Little Women is on TV. The old version. Well I don't know if there is a "new" version but this is the black and white one with Katherine Hepburn in it. I think this is AMC...they've been showing her movies all day; I don't believe it's her birthday, they mentioned something about an anniversary this morning. (No, we have not been watching this ALL day. A few hours, on and off, we watched other things.)  Well, that's all I can think of...Ok, that's all I feel like typing right now. This is long enough. I think I'm going to go spell check  urlLink Emilie 's blog or something. She said she couldn't get it to work.  [addition @ 11:40 PM: My blog does this funny thing where it only shows my comments after a week and I republish something that has to change all my pages like my layout. o.0 So i just got Emilie's comment that called Metallica "posers". Yes. There is arkie butt to kick when she get's back from Mississippi. But I'll be gentle because she said I rocked... WOOHOOO!]  [addition @ 12:05 AM Aug 06: Micah's blog is called  Weave of Madness . I thought I would share this. I was just like focusing on the slight irony/humor/wtfness I see in that.]
