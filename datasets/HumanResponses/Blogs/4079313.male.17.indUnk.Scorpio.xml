      I still havent done any work, Liam came out, and i had just started doing some,.  I aint seen him, or any of my friends in ages, i quit school at the end of last year and was working full time, saving to do what im doing now, snowboard during the week and work the weekends, this is great cos im doing what i love, but when ever i do see a mate, i get real down for no reason, i think im just jelous cos i cant go out and have fun with my friends on a friday nite, but instead i have to do this work(wich i could have done earlier in the week, but was to lazy) and then go to bed earlier, so i can go to a job that i hate just as much now as i did working 6 days a week, whys that? i havent goten drunk, or stoned or anything since i started snowboarding, wich probelly seems like a good thing, im not hurting my body blah blah blah, but then im also not doing my treadmill or eating healthy like i had been before i started this, i try to tell myself that i only eat junk and dont exersice cos i snowboard all week and burn it off, wich i genuinly think is true to some degree, i havent put any weight on acording to the scales but i think i may have a bit, and im certainlly not losing it like i was before hand.  Tonight, im actually kinda looking forward to the end of the ski season, then im gona go back to working full time, and try my best to work monday to friday, ill be turning 18 the weekend my local field is suposed to close, wich will be great, and ill hopefuly be able to become social again, I'm also looking forward to it, because at that point im prolly gona have to start to make some big decisions of where im heading in my life, at the moment im really wanting to go to china(if posible japan, but i dont think that posible) to teach english, iv allways wanted to go to china, as i wanna be part of the country thats gona become the superpower of the world in the next ten years...or so they say, either way its a very developing country and i wanna be a part of that, its a pretty sweet deal, i gey my airfair payed for, apartment payed for, pretty much everything and still get a really good salery, so im looking forward to looking into that further.    Hmm im starting to like this bloging thing, its a good way to vent, and i actually feel tons better.

      I dont really know why i'v decided to start doing this, i was planning on doing it when i decided on that big thing im gona do with my life,  and tell everyone about that journy,  but then i read an article on blogging and became curious about other people blogs, but I ended up signing up, and now im writing something, no ones prolly gonna read, seems like a good idea, iv allways wanted to right a journel or something, but im allways to lazy, this seems easier.    The real reason im probelly writing this is because i should really be doing some work,  I took the day off today telling myself i would spend it doing computer work for my dad, in fact iv gotten up at 2pm, its now 3:30pm and all iv done is read some news, surfed some forums and signed up for this, hmm i really should go do it.    God im lazy

      Well saturday and sunday i worked, i stayed at my dads like i allways do on a saturday nite, and went to see my house in umbria wich was average in my opinion, but there was a cute ticket girl there so that made up for it. once we got back from there i rang mum and found out that she had fell off a ladar and torn all the ligiments in her leg, shes on crutches and can hardly walk, so me and the rest of the family will be running the cafe and cleaning contract for the next few weeks, how that will affect my snowboarding i dont know, but i feel real bad for her. Last nite Josh came over and we got stoned wich was great and all, but earlier he had mentioned my x girlfriend Tarsh, i dumped her about a year and a half ago, and while i thought i was completly over her from the day i had dumped her, i talked to her a few months ago for the 1st time and have been thinking about her tons since then, last nite when i was stoned i got really depressed and felt lik breaking down, i couldny get her out of my head and wanted her back so bad, I felt so frustrated because i couldnt have her, and when i was with her it was like she was myn, allways there if everything else fucked up i allways had Tarsh, i guees i didnt think about that when i started hanging out with my new friends almost 2 years ago, and thought that she was just holding me back, oh how wrong i was, god i miss her and the feelings i had then i wish i could just ring her up and ask for her back, but i think she has probelly changed, and she wouldnt be the person i love, and i think maby thats whats frustrating me so much, its not like i want something that is hard to get to, its something thats dissapered compltley, not that i know this for sure, but i think its probbely true, shes had atleast 2 other searious relationships, while iv had none, maby thats my problem, i think i can only get those sorta feelings from her, like i look at other girls and there really cute and awsome people, i can see myself getting along with them great, im atracted to them and everything, but i allways end up trying to compare what it would be like being with them, compared to what it was like being with Tarsh and it allways leaves me thinking "no i couldnt feel the same way with her" god i really need to lose some weight and get a nice girlfriend, i want to experence those feelings again, feel needed and wanted and loved and return those feelings, the thing is most cute girls these days have been with tons of guys allready, no matter how sweat and inocent they seem they all seem to have slept around alot, id love to be able to find a girl who isnt like that, but at the same time not scared of everything, this is another reason i should have stayed with Tarsh, we where both out 1st searious realtionships, and so we didnt have any of those sorta hang ups.  Anyway i need to stop ranting and get motivated and out of this mood, iv got to go run mums cafe along with my step mum, so hopefully that will take my mind off all this love bullshit wich seems to take up so much of my time and make me so misreble.  Man i hope no one i know reads this
