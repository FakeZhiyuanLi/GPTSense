       Definitely loving my remade room...   I got a huge new desk! Big huge workstation with cupboards, drawers, and one nice big keyboard drawer! I'm just loving it! So how has everyone else been lately? Family doing well? How about your brother? I hear he's getting into big things now! Hehe, just playing with your mind! Feel free to leave comments people!   I start my temporary job tomorrow! I get to setup yet another router and a new DSL connection. At least I get to do what I love! I love to work with computers and I guess I'm pretty good at it. I guess that's where my fascination with all things electronic or mechanical comes from. It's just nerve calming...   What I also find fascinating is how disabled teachers think kids are with computers. In the computer labs, they give us tonnes of time to do something simple like open Microsoft Word. It feels quite degrading for most people my age simply because most of us are proficient computer users, and for some MSN is an extension of their life. Yes this is reality for some, but it can get a little bit scary to see these typists type their life away. At least thumb or something!

       Life is Good...(Mobile)   Well hello again fellow web surfers. I hope you all have been keeping well, and you're all ready for the Summer awaiting! It feels so great to feel the freedom! I've been sleeping so well lately, cuz of the lack of worries and stress. It's truly hard to avoid stress when you're in school because if u dunt worry about your work then you dunt care about it and you're just setting yourself up for bad grades and lotsa trouble! Man, my iPaq has been amazing lately! No trouble or conflicts and it just feels so satisfying to set schedules and to actually follow through with them. The thumb typing(thumbing) has also been great. Luckily I don't have huge fat fingers or else I'd be pressing 4 letters at once and just confusing everyone!   With life being so nice and relaxed, I've sought after a Summer job but to no avail as yet. I'm trying to get a job in the golf industry,but it has truly proven to be quite difficult! Not even at the miniputt place! Jeez! Well I better take up less of your time... thanks for reading though!

       School over, new life begins   So here I am writing yet another entry from the iPaq. I,m really loving this thing! Only thing about today is that I,m extremely sore from all the moving I did yesterday with my dad. Whoever knew that a single man could accumulate so many things?! It was insane I tell you, insane! Despite the stuff, all went well and we ended up having a good time instead of a painful one. Now today I sit here typing away on a thumb-board while trying to get the attention of a potential employer. It,s truly amazing how fast and accurately I can type with the simple tips of my thumbs and a blue backlit keyboard. How beautiful! Well I better get back to the phone cuz I am the only one who can make the calls, nobody can make them for me... unless... nah... Later guys!

      Looks like I took up the blogging thing again. Only problem is that I'm not coding my own site this time, simply because I don't have the money to buy my own domain and get movabletype like I want. Instead I have to stick with the free stuff and I figure that if I'm going to stick with the freebies that I at least make it somehow integrated with my new toys. Well it looks like I'm starting over, but this time with the help of my gadget I might make more entries consistently. Enjoy.

       Freedom is always sweet.   Dad's gone way outta town and the entire place is left to just me and my brother. We started off our freedom spree with a good 'ol movie tonight. We decided to see the truly hillarious, Anchorman, and man was that movie soo funny! Sometimes we just don't realize how such small things could be so funny! The advertisements may seem a little on the lame side but I guarantee that everyone would get a huge laugh out of it. Some of it is cruel humour but man, it could really make you laugh!   Hopefully I can get a chance to go clubbing this week while freedom still runs free. I wish I could go to some club downtown or maybe even that big place across in Gino town. Very big club and some amazing Eurodance and Hi-NRG music. Well hopefully I can find the time to write in more entries and keep this crazy blog updated and current. Later!

       Experiencing the Summer   Summer holidays have been going quite well and relaxing. I've made some money, finished some moving and started some lessons. Looks like I'm taking up Tai-Chi which is really great! I've always wanted to learn a physical art and Tai-Chi definitely seems to be the way to go!   Well I better get back to my reading because I've been reading Sun Tzu's Art of War. What an amazing piece of writing! It's so deep in meaning and the concepts are so easy to apply to almost anything! Now if only they could decode a more non-metaphorical version of the Tao Te Ching! Just kidding... It's great how is already. Everyone get reading before you got no time when school starts again!
