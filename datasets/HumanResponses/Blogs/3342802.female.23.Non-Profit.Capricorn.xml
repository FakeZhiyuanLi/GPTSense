      I live in the Midwest... Indiana to be exact.  We are in the hot spot for Brood X Cicadas.  Every 17 years, they come out of the ground and break out of their shells.  Wow, are they loud!!  I hear they don't actually eat while they are above ground although they do drink.  The only purpose I have been able to figure they serve is to prunt trees.  My 3yo dd has been carrying some around in a little bug catcher... she thinks they are cool although she doesn't want to touch them (just like momma LOL!).    According to some they are quite tasty and a good source of protein.  Eeewwww!  I'm not far away from being a vegetarian as it is, I am so picky about my meat.  I think I'll draw the line at bugs, even if cicadas are probably cleaner than say, a cow or pig.  :o  If you are curious about cicadas, click  urlLink here !  Have a buggy weekend!

       urlLink Formula fed babies more susceptible to disease, cancer and death   It just doesn't measure up.  Breast is Best... you hear it all the time but doesn't that mean formula is just fine?  Well, actually it does not.  Formula is better than no food, I can agree with that.  But if there is breastmilk to be had, I sincerely believe a baby deserves that breastmilk.  I'm not bashing moms who tried their best and just couldn't breastfeed (although I think faulty advice attributes way too often to weaning).  Not at all.  I can give you hundreds of reasons to breastfeed:  urlLink 101 Reasons to Breastfeed your Child  but you've probably heard them already.  After all, so-and-so is/was formula fed and they are just fine, right?  Well, only time will tell don't you think?  Why not just give your baby the BEST... which happens to be breastmilk.  It is free, and a little effort in establishing a nursing relationship can give you and your baby a special bond that comes not just from skin-to-skin contact and the perfect food, but from your decision to give your baby the BEST there is.  I think it's time for formula companies and prescription/OTC drug companies to stop pushing their wares on the American people.  Starting from the time our children start reading, watching TV, and socializing out in public; they are induated with advertising for formula, drugs that will fix your ailing body, diets that promise to make you look like you had a $4,500 tummy tuck and a boob job, and food that is colored with dyes known to cause hyperactivity and/or lethargy in children and adults.  Okay, I feel like it is time to get off my soap-box for awhile.  Enjoy your Sunday!

      We finally have drywall on the ceiling of our new bedroom.  We're adding a master bedroom, bathroom, and closet to our little 2 bedroom, 1 bath house.  We'll feel like we're living in a mansion when it's done.  We started the addition last April, so it's been a year in the making.  Boy, we've had a wild year.    It will be worth it, but some days I want to just chuck it all.  I'll be glad when we have a roomy bedroom!

      I'm having way too much fun customizing my BLOG.  :)  It's fun though and it's something easy enough to do while I am NAK.

      I inadvertantly hurt someone's feelings... and when I did so my heart was hurting so much for innocent children who lie alone in hospitals because their parents can't be with them.  Or in some cases, choose not to be.  I pray I am never in that situation, it was hard enough when my own brother was hospitalized for months before he died at 14 months.  We all wanted to be with him all the time, but what we wanted most was for him to be at home with us.  Those poor, poor children.  I pray for you tonight.

      Yup, it's that time again.  The thought of getting pregnant doesn't scare the life out of me anymore.  J is almost 14 months old now and I almost think I could handle it now.  On one hand, I'd love to go for it but on the other hand I would like another spring baby and the timing has to be right for that.  Hopefully by August I can convince Bill that one more child is in our future.  He's not so convinced, but then again he is up to his ears in work... his 40 hr/wk job and working on the addition to our house.  Maybe once we have that new bedroom...  ;)

      Jenn had a double mastectomy before getting pregnant with her first child.  She is unable to breastfeed, but still desires to give her son breastmilk.  She takes donations of pumped breast milk and pays all shipping costs.  If you have breastmilk to donate or you can pump breastmilk for Grayson, go to   urlLink http://www.feedmybaby.com   for more details!  NOTE: Jenn is really low on breastmilk in storage so she really needs donations!!

      I've had some comments about my post "Formula just doesn't measure up".  I want to address a couple of things.   jenavive said, "{applause} I agree wholeheartedly!"    Thank you Jenavive.  :)  That's one of the wonderful things about the online world, I am able to find those who agree with me.   Jenni said, "My last baby REFUSED to take the breast. I tried. I called everyone and every nurse I could think of and he would not do it. He was preemie and I don't think his suck was strong enough. After a week I gave him a bottle. He did fine. My first baby I pumped for a month and he passed away before we could use it, he was very preemie. I donated the milk to the other babies. My middle one would have stayed on the breast for a life time but I couldn't keep up with the demand. I know breast is the best but sometimes you just can't."    I guess I forgot to say that sometimes there are problems and you have to make a choice.  IMO though, your preemie NEEDED breastmilk even more than a full-term baby.  Mothers of preemies have breastmilk of a different composition, made especially for their babies.  Did you attempt to pump so that your baby could be fed your breastmilk via tube or syringe or even bottle?  I am so sorry that your first baby died, I can only imagine how terrible it was (and I have known loss as my infant brother died of brain cancer complications when I was 9 years old) to loss your son.  You said your middle son would stayed on the breast forever but you couldn't keep up.  Well, breastmilk is supply and demand so restricting nursing will restrict your supply.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you... did you mean he nursed too much for you?   GlycoFamily said, "You go girl! I think we bought our soapbox from the same dealer :)  My sis has a baby who has been in NICU for over 2 weeks. Praise the Lord he goes home tomorrow but my sis was told not to breastfeed (and that includes pumping) because her milk is growing organisms or some crazy mess like that. UGh! I offerred to pump (and already have) for him but my sis said, "Nah, that's OK. If formula is OK with the neonatologists then it's OK with me."  BIG SIGH.........  Hope to read you often :)"    I find that horrifying.  Despite medical evidence (and evidence of preemies and babies everywhere), some doctors choose to ignore how vital breastmilk can be for babies.  If we deny a baby breastmilk, we can never know their full potentional.  How can you say, I fed formula and it didn't hurt him?  Your baby misses out on vital brain food that formula just can't provide.  Why would you CHOOSE to deny your baby?      Erin said, "Well, I would go one step further and say the formula on the market today is junk food. It would be better to make your own from whole food sources. Check out the book Nourishing Traditions for more info. But of course, human milk for human babies... it is so sad women are given poor information/support, and have to suffer through bottle feeding."    I agree Erin, to a certain extent.  I think formula is gross, but I suppose I am glad it's there for the babies who actually NEED it.  However, before I would give formula I would first choose my pumped milk and if that was unavailable I would use donated milk from friends (or others if I could afford a pastuerizer like Jenn at http://www.feedmybaby.com ).  Then and only then would I give formula.  I wouldn't starve my baby, but I wouldn't choose to feed my baby something that is made for a cow and has to be diluted and then fortified.  BTW, they fortify formula with the cheapest iron available, hence many babies don't even absorb what they need. More comments coming soon.  :)

      August 1 -7 2004 is World Breastfeeding Week.&nbsp; Help spread the word!&nbsp; Many towns will be the site of&nbsp; Nurse Out hosted by a local mom (see  urlLink http://www.promom.org/NNO  for more info) or a LLL World Walk for Breastfeeding (see  urlLink http://www.lalecheleague.org/walk.html ).  A recent article by a Harvard student was brought to my attention on the MDC Breastfeeding Support and Advocacy board (see  urlLink http://www.mothering.com/discussions ) and I'll post it here for you: &nbsp; urlLink Not a formula for success .  Breastfeed your child in public this week... or if your child has already weaned, reminisce about your nursing relationship.  Cheers, Michelle

      LOL... nothing like your 3.5yo daughter coming into the bathroom just in time to see you insert your  urlLink DivaCup !  I could see the wheels turn in her head and she wondered how  that  fit in  there .    Anyway, now I'll extol the virtues of menstrual cups and cloth pads.  Love 'em!  No more icky smell from perfumed tampons and pads!  Menstrual cups are available in three varieties that I am aware of: the  urlLink Keeper , the  urlLink DivaCup  and the  urlLink Mooncup .  The Keeper is made from natural gum rubber and the Mooncup and DivaCup are made from medical grade silicone.  The DivaCup differs slightly in shape from the Mooncup and Keeper.  If you don't like internal protection, cloth pads are great!  Hate stains?  Some brands come in low-impact dyed varieties and pretty prints.  Some brands to try are:  urlLink Lunapads ,  urlLink GladRags  and  urlLink TLC Pads .  Lots of WAHM make pads as well.  If you want to read more, go to the  urlLink menstrual cups  page on my website.
