       This post will be different everytime you look at it. I have a lot of inside stories and this is the post that I'm going to post them all.....They'll mostly be quotes that some people will understand and most won't.....so here they are......   &nbsp;  "Do you go to college?"   "Wanna go measure the acrage of my woodlot?"   Hitting my head at Kohl's...it sucked.   Dropping my baton on my head 7 times in one day at band camp.....sucked!!!   Hitting my knee on Mo's computer desk really hard....also sucked.   Tripping over my feet every time I walk...that is pretty cool though!!!   "I have two dollars."   "Wanna go for a walk?"   "Does anyone have a room key?....I DO!!!!"

       All of the posts before this are all serious. FYI....I'm NEVER this serious. I'm usually messing around and laughing. I barely ever stop laughing. I'm always having a good time with my friends. So if you're reading my posts and thinking...wow....she's boring. I'm not that boring...I'm pretty cool once you get to know me. And if you're a guy...get to know me because I'm lonly! Ha ha ha.

       One of my brother's friends and I started talking a lot! He'd come over and we'd stay up most of the night talking and watching tv. It was like that one song...staying up all night sleeping all day. It was so much fun. Then I started liking him...A LOT!!! And according to his friends...he liked me too...A LOT. And one week he started hanging out with me even more. He took me to one of his family's wedding receptions. The the next week we went to a party together. Well it started off pretty fun...but then his ex-girlfriend called him crying her eyes out saying how badly she wanted to get back together with him. At the time he basically said "screw you." Then she found out about me, and that we've been talking a lot and stuff. Then the next day I get a call from him saying that we need to stop doing whatever we were doing because he's been talking to his ex-girlfriend. So now they're dating again and I'm sitting here lonlier than EVER. And it sucks. I can't seem to get over him. I can't stop thinking about him. It's hard to forget about someone you like so much...but I'm going to have to!!

       This year I'm going to be a senior!!!! I think it's going to be a ton of fun!!! I run cross country, I'm student council, and I'm a majorette for the marching band (ya...laugh it up...I go to band camp)!! So I'll keep pretty busy. In two weeks I leave for cross country camp and that's going to be a ton of fun. And in one week the fair is here. The best week of the summer. I take pigs, rabbits, and chickens. It's sad to see my piggies leave...but I make some pretty good bucks!

       I have a 8 year old cousin who has cancer. Lately it's been getting really bad. Just the other day he lost his eye-sight completly. Then last night my grandma called and said he has a 10% chance of living. It's really sad to see someone that young dying. He's really fun to be around. So please keep him in your prayers because he needs it. Thank you.

        Around Spring Breakish time I started dating the biggest QUIER in the world!!!! His name is Mike Spaulding and he goes to Summerfield High School. He makes you do stuff you really don't want to and he "cons" you into thinking that just because you like him you should do stuff with him. WHICH IS DUMB!!! Any girl who knows this kid....STOP TALKING TO HIM RIGHT NOW!!! He is the biggest ass-hole in the world. He deserves no one's time. Not only did he do all that stuff, but he made me and one of my better friends stop talking. Me and my friend (no names named) used to hang out EVERY day and do stuff all the time. Now we barely talk. It's some of my fault too, somewhat...but more his. It's a long story....but please, I beg any girl who is reading this to not get to know or talk to a red haired FAGGOT whose name is Mike Spaulding!!!

       My name is Christina and right now I'm 17 years old. I live in a small town called Ida. It is pretty awesome...our high school has only 600 students...which is pretty small. Which means talk spreads FAST...weather it's right or wrong. Most of the time it's wrong which is the only sucky part about living in Ida. Other than having nothing to do other than going to parties. Anyways...I have a mom and a dad and one brother. I have one brother who is 19 and his name is Justin. He's pretty cool too...he takes me to his friend's parties and stuff...it's pretty cool. Lately we've gotten kinda close, which is cool. My dad was diagnosed with MS a couple of years ago. If you don't know what MS is, it's a muscle disease that effects every person differently. It's kind of a sucky sickness to have because doctor's don't have a cure beacuse like I said, it effects every person differently. My mom is pretty cool, I can tell her about almost everything.&nbsp; My mom's paretns died when I was 4, but my dad's parents are still alive. My Grandma and Grandpa don't really like me...so that's pretty cool&nbsp;I geuss. In their world, you have to have kids and not be married and be really stupid for them to buy you stuff. It's wierd...anyways... I kinda have two jobs. I babysit my 9 year old cousin who live in Newport and I waitress at a resturant in Point Place (Ohio) called The Landings. That job sucks but the money is good. And that's pretty much my life story in a nutshell. I hope you like my blog!!!!
