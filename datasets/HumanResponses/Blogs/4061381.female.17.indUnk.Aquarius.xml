      Malungkot dito sa bahay namin ngayon. Sa  katunayan nga ay, habang sinusulat ko ito ngayon,  ay pinagbawalan kaming magkakapatid na gumamit ng  kompyuter (kaya hindi ko alam kung kailan ko ito  ma-uupload, tatakas nalang siguro ulit ako  mamaya). Bawal din ang manood ng TV at mag-iisang  linggo nang confiscated ang celpon ko. Bukod sa  walang magawa, palagi nalang kami nagsisigawan  dito. Sana pasukan na. Nakakapagod nang maging  malungkot. Balang araw masasanay na rin ako dito  sa loob ng bahay. Balang araw, magiging manhid na  ako sa lahat.   Hindi ko kasi lubos maintindihan kung ano talaga  ang gusto nila. Kung ano man iyon, paano kung  hundi ko maibigay sa kanila? E di habambuhay na  akong ganito? Habambuhay na akong may sama ng  loob sa kanila? Habambuhay kaming hindi  magkakaintindihan.   Oo, tanggap ko na ngang wala silang tiwala sa  akin. Kaya nga kahit 17 na ako, bihira akong  nakakaalis. Mahirap magpaalam. Pakiramdam nila  siguro, tuwing lalabas ako ng bahay, may  papatayin akong tao. Pakiramdam siguro nila,  kriminal ako. Hindi ko na aasahan na dumating pa  ang araw na magkakaroon sila ng 100% na tiwala sa  akin. Dahil alam kong hinding-hindi mangyayari  yon. Hindi ba nila naisip na kaya madalas akong  nagsisinungaling sa kanila ay dahil kapag sinabi  ko ang totoo, hindi nila ako papayagan. How much  siffering will I take to gain their trust? Wala.  Kakalimutan ko nalang na may sarili akong buhay.  Dahil ang gusto nila ay mabulok ako sa bahay na  ito. Hanggang kamatayan. Eto na siguro ang misyon  ko. Ang pasayahin sila, kahit na ako hinde.   Naisip ko, mahigit isang taon na akong ganito sa  bahay na ito. May nahanap akong journal entry  last year. Eto, basahin nyo.   (Sinulat ko noong March 2003) her visual  surrounding conceptualizes complete anathema.  there is no other way out. years of scrutiny and  months in pain. her whole lifetime was  painstakingly spent in a dark place, where  monstrous whispers and glaring eyes collide to  keep her awake at night. these whispers, soft as  may seem; holds the sovereignty that deliberately  kills her damned soul. and all she ever wanted  was to fly away... she knew she can't cut loose  from the old rusty chains holding her. then she  remembers what those nightly whispers  said, "there is no way out." she remembers. faded  hope. tears fell because she knew--she knew she  wont have the chance to see the daylight; and  she'll never ever fly again. she had no other  choice but to stay in that cursed home; and be  stuck for the rest of time. her paranoia muses.  those whispers won't stop--it's killing her  system every single time it utters those words.

      Mmm...I wasn't feeling well last night, and I bet y'all know, so as my Hubby...But he's been feelin quite a lot better than me...So, yesterday he's been takin gooood care of me... :D   We were havin lunch at Greenwich yesterday and they gave us a survey form, we had to write our name down. He wrote : Mr. and Mrs. Andrada :D khh khh...   Then we were all mushy mushy last nyt...*kilig* :D   Baby, you might think that I'm not taking whatever you're telling me seriously, but I do. I do. :D And I'm thankful because you've been really showy of how you feel for me. Thanks for all the hugs and the back rubs, the kisses, the nose pinching... :D for keeping me warm...and for telling me that you're happy being wit me, and you do think na wala nang tatalo sa happiness na nararamdaman mo...cus we're together. I couldn't ask for anything else.   This is it.This has to be it.   I've never felt as strong...and as weak...thinking about spending the reeeessst of my life. With you.   I'm so proud of you, I'm so proud of us. Of the couple we could turn out to be. On how we both could grow together. Grow strong as a couple, and stronger individuals as well. On how much we can learn from each other. You changed me. For the better. I am now someone I didn't think I could become.   People could think of us as whatever. Some may say that we won't last. But hey, that's what THEY think. What matters is US. YOU AND ME. We're in this together, Baby. :D   I LOVE YOU SOOOO DAMN MUCH! :D

      HOWS IT GONNA BE?     Last nyt we were (actually I) was thinking of how things are gonna be when I graduate, and My Baby goes like : " Baby, mag-enjoy muna tayo ngaun, masyado kang ahead eh! " and then he smiled. He's right. I won't enjoy time wit him when all I do is think of the future and not "live in the moment".   He was sooo sweet last night. He even said "baby, akin ka lang huh..." and I thought to myself, DUH! Arvin, of course. I'm all yours, baby. I really really like the way he is now. All showy... Thank God... :D   Baby wus bloggin last Sat, we were together at Nebo... and he typed like MORE than the usual, and then BOOM! All the lights go out. Shiyet. It dint just happen once y'know. The first time when this command came out and he had ta close all the windows... Funny... Sad, tho. I love readin his thoughts... Especially when it comes ta the kilig part... :D He wus so pissed afterwards. I feel him. But he looked so cute though. :D   I miss lyceum, bilyaran, the beer garden, & them. We don't hang out very often nemore.  Sometimes, no matter how happy you are, you can't avoid missing the past. :D But that doesn't mean I'm not satisfied wit my life now.

      Come to think of it, we had lunch almost everyday and we ALWAYS have dinner together. Just US. Wow. :D   And I have been waiting for that to happen for the longest time! GAWD! 48 years! hahahaha!!! :D   This week though, I know we'll be back to the "normal" days again. But at least we still have dinner together. :D   *sigh*...Baby, Baby, Baby... I just can't live without you... :D MWWWWAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!  ...Tara na kc, pakasal na kc tayo... :D :D :D Dun din naman tayo pupunta eh... *kilig*...I've been praying that to God...everytime I go to church.   Don't ever get fed up of me, Baby... Don't leave.   I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU ,I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU!!!   Kulang pa yan noh...kahit sabihin ko sayo in difrnt dialects, it still ain't enough! MWAH!

      "THINK". I hate to admit that I WANT this to be it.  My baby says it's good ta dream of spending the rest of our lives wit each other...but as he puts it, I hafta be ready...for whatever could happen. Altho he told me that he does want to spend his life wit me too... Just that...he says we never kno wat cud happen. He says that I'm sensitive... "mahirap na, pag nasaktan ka.."  BUT...wit someone like Baby, it's just really hard not to think of life wit him. What's life like when he's there. When he's beside me. When he whispers "I LOVE YOU" in me ears ( just like he did last night! :D )   IT'S HARD NOT TO FALL HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH ARVIN JAMES BAUTISTA ANDRADA.  I wouldn't want ta elaborate more, it's a public blog! Cus if I tell you how he really is like, you might just fall for him... :D I know some already might have... tsk tsk..  You just have no idea... :)

         A hundred days had made me older  since the last time that I saw your pretty face  A thousand lights had made me colder  and I don’t think I can look at this the same   But all the miles had separate  They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face   I’m here without you baby  but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby  and I dream about you all the time   I’m here without you baby  but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight it’s only you and me   The miles just keep rolling  as the people either way to say hello  I hear this life is overrated  but I hope it gets better as we go   I’m here without you baby  but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby  and I dream about you all the time   I’m here without you baby  but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl it’s only you and me   Everything I know, and anywhere I go  it gets hard but it won’t take away my love  And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done  it get hard but it won’t take away my love   I’m here without you baby  but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby  and I dream about you all the time   I’m here without you baby  but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl it’s only you and me

      Put an emphasis on "THAT".   Imagine getting a card  from someone you love so much which has words  like that on it. I mean, Arvin isn't the type of  person who goes mushy on me on an occassional  basis. But when he does, grabe. Nakakalaglag  panty! :D  But really, maybe it is true. A person who  doesn't really say I LOVE YOU often doesn't mean  he doesn't, as long as he makes you feel that he  does. But now I understand that when they do say  it, they really DO mean it. Oftentimes my Baby  gets misunderstood. And I swear, I have learned  so much from him. The thing is, he doesn't really  Baby me!!! It does suck sometimes but...he makes  me realize things...(But Baby, you still have to  make suyo! hehe..)  last Friday night: sleep over, (me and vin..)  They were all like "Asteeg! Your mom let you  sleep over wit AJ?" hehe. Well, that's how close  me and my Mum are. And that's how much she trusts  both of us. I feel so lucky. My mum just doesn't  know how much. But I am. I feel so fortunate.And  I may not be Bill Gate's daughter, I feel like  one of the richest kids...filled wit God's  blessings. *sigh*.  Grabe. feels so good to wake up next ta him  again. Thing is, when I woke up he was already  awake, and he had his big arms around me..I even  caught him staring at me. Haha. :D As much as I  hate him looking at me, I just LOOOVE it whenever  he does. What irony. :D There was this time when  I was falling asleep, and I just peeked and he  was staring! He's like... "Ang cute!!!" hehe.  Aww. *kilig*...one thing I love is whenever we'd  do that nose to nose thing and he'd end up  kissing it. Gawd, that guy just loves pinching my  nose. I don't see anything so different about it.  Mmm...  Then we were having lunch, just as I was getting  the skin out of the chicken that I ordered, he  said..."baby, may sasabihin ako sayo..pero mamaya  na, hiya kc ako eh...eat ka muna..." So I did.  AND THEN afterwards, we were about to cross the  street, I asked him seriously, and I looked  really scared..."You're breaking up wit me,  aren't you?..." And then he gave me this look and  nodded. "Mmm hmm"... and I'm like "No way.  Really?"... and he looked so serious and then...I  was almost gonna get teary eyed, he looked at me,  grabbed me by the waist and smiled. "Baby!!! I'm  not!!" Turns out he was just kidding. BAD JOKE  ARVIN JAMES BAUTISTA ANDRADA!!! hehe. I needed ta  sit down at the rotonda cus it felt like I had  the whole world on my shoulders. He kept rubbing  my back, and he wus kissing my cheeks saying, "Di  ko gagawin un noh! Mahal kita!!!".. MMM! But the  hard part still wusn over. What wus he gonna tell  me?  *drum roll* PAMPAMPAAAAA.....   "Si wish tska si...ayoko!!! di ko alam kung pano  ko sasabihin...nahihiya tlga ako sayo baby...bago  ko sabihin sayo, Magso-sorry na muna ako...sana  ma-forgive mo ako..."  It took me about 10 minutes before I could  actually let him spill. Turns out, this blue  throw pillow and the teddy bear I gave him wus  stolen last summer. WISH and  BABY..*sniff*...GONE. Wish wus one of those  impromptu gifts. I just ran across it and thought  of giving it ta ARVIN. I sprayed my perfume  (which wus Carolina Herrera's CHIC at that time,  Andrew loved it on me...) all over it and he'd  text me at 12 or 1 in the morning telling  me "SH*T! miss na tlga kita...:'( " hehehe. and  BABY, that teddybear I gave him, we used to say  it's our Baby, and whenever he'd hug me and Baby  at the same time he'd blurt out "Yay, Family na  tayo..."...I can see that he's sad and he's  pissed that they were, take note: STOLEN. And I'm  not mad at him, it's not his fault. It saddens  both of us. *sigh*.  ARVIN is deeper than I thought. I'm sorry if you  get misunderstood most of the time, Baby. I'm  sorry.

      Tingin ng mga bobong kapitbahay ko puta daw  ako. Nagpapagamit, binabayaran. Sabi nila ako daw ang pinakamaganda at  pinakasikat sa aming lugar  noon. Ang bango-bango ko daw, sariwa at makinis. Di  ko nga alam kung sumpa  ito, dahil dito naletse ang kinabukasan ko.  Tara makinig ka muna sa kwento ko, yosi muna  tayo.   Alam mo, maraming lumapit sa akin, nagkagusto,  naakit.   Ang hirap pag lahat sa iyo virgin eh. Tinanggap  ko naman silang tao, bakit kaya nila ako ginago? Masakit alalahanin,  iniisip ko na lang  na kase di sila taga rito, siguro talagang ganoon. Tatlong  malilibog na  foreigners ang namyesta sa katawan ko, na-rape daw ako.   Sa tatlong beses akong nagahasa, ang pinakahuli  ang di ko  makakalimutan. Parang maski di ko ginusto ang mga nangyari,  hinahanap-hanap ko siya. Tinulungan nya kasi akong makalimutan yung mga  sadistang Hapon. Kase, ibang-iba ang hagod niya. Umiikot ang mundo ko  sa tuwing ginagamit  niya ako. Ibang klase siya mag-sorry, lalo pa at  kinupkop niya ako at ang mga naging anak ko.  Parating ang dami naming regalo - may  chocolates, yosi, ano ka! May datung pa! Nakakabaliw siya, alam kong  ginagamit nya lang ako pero  pagamit naman ako nang pagamit. Sa kanya namin  natutunan mag-inggles, di lang magsulat ha! Magbasa pa! Hanggang ngayon, sa  tuwing mabigat ang  problema ko, siya ang tinatakbuhan ko. 'Yun nga lang, lahat  ng bagay may  kapalit. Nung kinasama ko siya, guminhawa buhay namin. Sosyal  na sosyal kami.   Ewan ko nga ba, akala ko napapamahal na ako sa  kanya. Akala ko tuloy-tuloy na kaligayahan namin, yun pala unti- unti niya akong  pinapatay. P*** ng I**! Sa dami ng lason na sinaksak niya sa katawan ko,  muntik na akong malaspag. Ang daming nagsabi na ang tanga tanga ko.  Patalsikin ko na daw. Sa tulong ng mga anak ko, napalayas ko ang animal  pero ang hirap  magsimula.   Masyado na kaming nasanay sa sarap ng buhay na  naranasan namin sa  kanya. Lubog na lubog pa kami sa utang, kulang ata pati  kaluluwa namin para ibayad sa mga inutang namin.   Sinikap naming lahat maging maganda ang buhay  namin. Ayun, mga nasa Japan, Hong Kong, Saudi ang mga anak ko. Yung  iba nag-US,  Europe. 'Yung iba ayaw umalis sa akin. Halos lahat, wala naman  silbi, masaya daw sa  piling ko, maski amoy usok ako.   Sa dami ng mga anak ko na nagsisikap na tulungan  ang kalagayan namin, siya din ang dami ng mga anak ko na namamantala  sa kabuhayan at  kayaman na itinatabi ko para sa punyetang kinabukasan  naming lahat. Dumating ang panahon na di na kami halos makaahon sa hirap ng  buhay. Napakahirap dahil nasanay na kami sa ginhawa at sarap.   Ang di ko inaakala ay mismong mga anak ko, ang  tuluyang sisira sa  akin. Napakasakit tanggapin na malinlang. Akala ko ay  makakakita ako ng magiging kasama sa buhay sa mga ahas na  ipinakilala ng mga anak ko  Hindi pala. Ang tanga ko talaga. Binugaw ako ng sarili kong  mga anak kapalit ng  kwarta at pansamantalang ginhawa na nais nilang  matamasa.   Wala na akong nagawa dahil sa sobrang pagmamahal  ko sa aking mga anak. Wala akong ibang yaman kundi ganda ko.  Pinagamit ko na lang ng  pinagamit ang sarili ko, basta maginhawa lang ang mga anak  ko.   Usap-usapan ako ng mga kapitbahay ko. May  nanghihinayang, namumuhi at naaawa. Puta na kase ang isang magandang tulad  ko.   Alam mo, gusto ko na sanang tumigil sa pagpuputa  kaso ang laki talaga  ng letseng utang ko eh. Palaki pa ng palaki.  Kulang na kulang. Paano  na lang ang mga anak ko naiwan sa aking punyetang  puder? Baka di na ako  balikan o bisitahin ng mga nag-abroad kong mga anak.  Hindi na importante kung laspagin man ang ganda ko, madama ko lang ang  pagmamahal ng mga anak  ko. Malaman nila na gagawin ko ang lahat para  sa kanila.   Sa tuwing titingin ako sa salamin, alam ko  maganda pa rin ako. Meron  pa din ang bilib sa akin. Napapag usapan pa din.  Sa tuwing nakikita ko  ang mukha ko sa salamin, nakikita ko ang mga anak  ko. Tutulo na lang ang  mga luha ko ng di ko namamalayan. Ang gagaling nga ng  mga anak ko,  namamayagpag kahit saan sila pumunta. Mahusay sa kahit anong  gawin. Tama man o  mali. Proud ako sa kanila. Kaso sila, kabaligtaran  ang nararamdaman para  sa akin.   Sa dami ng mga anak ko, iilan lang ang may  malasakit sa akin. May malasakit man, nahihilaw. Ni di nga ako  kinikilalang ina. Halos  lahat sila galit sa isa't isa. Walang gusto magtulungan,  naghihilahan pa. Ang dami  ko ng pasakit na tiniis pero walang sasakit pa nung  sarili kong mga anak ang nagbugaw sa akin. Kinapital ang laspag na ganda  ko. Masyado silang nasanay sa sarap ng buhay. Minsan sa pagtingin  ko sa salamin, ni  hindi ko na nga kilala sarili ko.   Dadating na naman ang pasko, sana maalala naman  ako ng mga anak ko. Isang buwan pa, magbabagong taon na. Natatakot  ako sa taong  darating. Ngayon pa lang usap usapan na ang susunod na pagbubugaw  ng ilan sa mga anak  ko. Sana may magtanggol naman sa akin, ipaglaban  naman nila ako. Gusto  kong isigaw: "INA NINYO AKO! MAHALIN NYO NAMAN AKO!"   Sige, dumadrama na ako. Masisira na ang make up  ko nito eh. Salamat  ha, pinakinggan mo ako. Ay sorry, di ko nasabi  pangalan ko.   Pilipinas nga pala.

      today,.i found out that... LOVE YOUR NEIGHBORS...JUST DONT GET CAUGHT... hmn, hmn..  One of things I want EVERYONE to know (and understand...)  I'm not tryna make a big deal outta all these people tagging nega comments, or people tryna ruin my day...  Guys, things like that used to affect me BIG TIME. Take note: USED TO.  But people like Len, Drich and Drew and Arvin of course have been telling me that I shouldn't be minding them.  They are right.  I know that I'm not doing anything wrong. And if you have a problem wit me, wit the way I talk, the way I dress, the way I act, well that's not my problem anymore...  But then if you still feel like tagging, GO RIGHT AHEAD. I won't mind :D   that's all for now. gots ta run! ;p   MWAH! HI BABY! hehe...

      today,.i found out that...You can choose to run away from the curtain call once in a while. It helps.     You know how plays go, whenever they put the curtains up you hafta put this happy face, even when you feel like you have the whole world in your shoulders? Because you're supposed to carry out the world like you're supposed to, because in that way you can reach out to the audience.   I guess I don't hafta explain any further. You go figure out what I'm tryna say.  Behind the smiles...you just have no idea.  To top it all off, I am okay. Why shouldn't I be, right? But there are just so many things that actually affect me big time. But, I have my friends, I have Arvin...I have God to count on.   *smiles*   But that's just how things are sometimes. Life can really kick you in the ass. What to do about it? You can wallow about it for as long as you want to, or you can simply learn how to forget about it. They happen for a reason. Easier said than...you know, thinking about it.

      today,.i found out that... there's so many freaks...  What is it wit gurls lookin at me from head ta foot like they're Goddesses or sumn? Okay, not that I'm tryin ta imply anything...just that I always get that look... and I just wanna say, that none of you...has the rights to look at me like that, like olla you are perfect or sumn. If you don't like something about me, (Gosh I've been saying this a hundred of times...) It's not my problem. As long as I know that I'm not doing nething wrong.   I guess there's just nothing I could do about it. No matter what I say, it won't change anything. They'll always be there.   But hey! Who cares what they think? :) No biggie... So, what am I stressing out on anyways? :D  And to the MAN in my life...mmm...inaalok ka nanaman magmodel no? tsktsk...

OooO! and the eiffel tower. One romantic place ta make... okay, OVERSHARE! hehe! :D    Everytime I sit next ta him, I just pray and thank God for having him there next ta me. It's much more dramatic as you think. And I will never get fed up of saying that YOU just have NO IDEA. How happy and how lucky I am...   Really.  AH!

      I actually feel so lucky to have found someone who I believe I perfectly belong to. It's like when everything just falls into place.   Gawd it just really is hard to explain. But I feel it. I really do! Now I understand how my Baby feels like when he says "Baby, ang hirap tlga i-explain..." and he's always telling me that feelings just can't be explained. That's why they are simply FELT. :D Thankfully, Baby has learned how to express himself. Gawd, it's like... nakakalaglag. OHMYGAWD. :D *kilig*... :) I get that spine tingling feeling...that feeling when your heart just keeps beating faster...when you get the hair at the back of your nape standing up. And he's the only one who's ever made me feel this way.  He's just been so patient wit me. Hey I know, it's only 6 months to most of you, but like I've always been saying, those weren't easy. We had to do so much adjustments. We had to work on our relationship... And finally, we've learned how to balance it. Wit our busy schedule and all that.  "SAKTO LANG." Hehe. That's how we are. WHOO! :D  Okay, gots ta go.  Arvin James Bautista Andrada... I will marry you... When the right time comes... I will... Just... STAY wit me, Baby. WE CAN MAKE IT. :D  One day, we'll be looking back at all the trials we've been through. I really do have faith in us, Baby.  :( I don't wanna leave my Baby... *sniff*... anyways, enough of that.  Madami pang araw for us ta spend together.  I LOVE YOU, hubby! :D
