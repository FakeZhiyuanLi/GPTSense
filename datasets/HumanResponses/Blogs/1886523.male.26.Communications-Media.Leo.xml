       The O.C.  moves to Wednesday nights!  From  urlLink Zap2it.com :   In a shake-up of its post-World Series schedule, FOX announced Monday (Sept. 29) that it will move its summertime hit "The O.C." into the 9 p.m. ET Wednesday spot when it returns in late October. "The Bernie Mac Show" is clearing out of the timeslot and moving to Sunday nights.   The show will now air on October 29th, with FOX's Shakespearian drama,  urlLink Skin , taking over the Thursday slot.  So they shaved a day off your wait, but that's still gonna be  30 DAYS  away.  I really have to get my hands on episode 110...

      "What do you think about Newport so far?"   36 days  left kiddies, and I bet you've already scratched all the wallpaper off your bedroom walls trying to keep your sanity. Is she going to live!? Is she going to die!? Coooooooop! Stay away from the light!  Alright, without toying with your minds any longer, allow me to introduce the  Marissa Cooper action figure . BOOM!       Marissa Cooper comes with the following:  1 - pair designer blue jeans 1 - gorgeous Cotillion dress 1 - trendy purse 1 - shirt she wore at the very first party 1 - cell phone for calling Summer about Stupid Luke  and finally...  1 - bottle of off-the-market pain killers from Mexico!  So there it is. Print her off, cut her out, and let her mingle with the likes of your  urlLink Ryan Atwood figure . So now you can act out how you think Coop is going to get out of that situation. How are you going to end it...?

      You'd think that ex-Hurricane Isabel washed across my desk out here in Los Angeles. Paper and assorted office products stewn about, and half my desk is without power. The Buzzer is bee-zee.  I'm sorry, but I have to let you all down again today. No updates. But I'm going to go out on a limb and offer you a promise. I promise that tomorrow, probably in the afternoon, you'll have your own Marissa Cooper action figure with accessories. That way, if the Buzzer is ever in a bind again, you can act out your own  O.C.  scenarios without me.  And now if you'll excuse me, [ pulling heavy duty goggles over eyes ] I have a desk to find...

      BAM! What a weekend. I can't complain too much about seeing  urlLink episode 109, "The Heights."  And all I can say about this episode is that if you know someone who has never seen  The O.C. , then "The Heights" is the episode that you need to make them watch. It's THAT good.  I think it's time to check my mail bag again and see if any special readers wrote me over the weekend. Let's see...bills, bills, bills...AH-HA! This is a great one...   Dear Buzz Rodell,  I'm a late twenty-something guy who is a failure with the ladies. Everytime I go out to bars and try to meet girls, I end up alone and feeling like a big loser. I think that I'm a great guy and would treat a special lady like she was a princess. But I just don't have the confidence to go out and ask a girl out.  Also, people think I'm weird.  Do you have any advice for me? Please Buzz...I'm so alone...  Sincerely,  - Weak in the Knees    ------------------------------   Dear Weak in the Knees,  Buck up little camper, it's not as bad as you think!  I too, used to be a huge failure with the ladies. I'd say something really stupid about their dress or spill drinks on them. I was really bad at the dating game. But then I created something that really changed everything.  It's not a super pill, it's not a new hair styling product. What it is, is pure magic. What I created is simply a replica pair of Peter Gallagher's awesome eyebrows. I cut them out individually, rolled a little masking tape on the back, smacked them against my existing brows and headed out into the social scene.  From the moment I entered the room, not a single person could take their eyes off me. I was king, just like Gallagher. The man of men.  And now you're probably thinking, "But Buzz, I don't have HUNDREDS of dollars to spend on your faux-brows." Well what I'm about to tell you, will BLOW your minds...  ...they're totally free.  THAT'S RIGHT! Just print out the page below, cut out the eyebrows and strap them on!       Trust me. They work.  So there you go "Weak in the Knees," I hope my little creation works, the Buzzer is always glad to lend a helping hand to those who aren't as cool as the Buzzer.  Sincerely,  Buzz Rodell

      Every now and then, I'm sure you've found yourself watching a television show and drifting off to a fantasy land where you just happen to be involved as a character on that show. I'm sure there's enough people out there who have thought about acting as Seth's girlfriend or Marissa's best friend. Am I right?  So I started thinking, who would I, Buzz Rodell, veteran actor, be if  urlLink Josh Schwartz  and  urlLink McG  were scrounging around for new characters on  The O.C. ?  Honestly, it wouldn't matter as long as I had my chance to steal Summer away. Maybe Seth has an older cousin who is in town while he's checking out California colleges. And maybe this cousin is just like an older Seth, but has ironed out his friendship issues, and girl issues. Maybe this cousin comes into Newport and starts throwing a wrench in everyone's works. He's from another well-to-do family, so he fits in with the Newportians (that's right Newportians). Yet, he's got that bad side to him. Luke worships the ground he walks on and he makes Ryan's past look like nothing. And the worst part about him is that he catches Summer's eye. He's everything that she wants Seth to be and this starts a battle between Seth and the cousin.  Oooh, that's good stuff. I'm glad I'm throwing all my ideas out there for you fanfic people to steal.  Or maybe my character would be Luke's step-brother from who knows where. But he's totally the opposite of Luke and hates his step-brother for being a huge tool. But then maybe this step-brother is the perfect cross between Luke and Ryan and begins to steal Marissa away from both of them (that's saying Marissa even makes it out of TJ).  42 days left. How's everyone holding up?

      This is how we decorate in the O.C.!  You've probably seen the pretty cool posters that were floating around when the show premiered. They showed images of the cast with titles like, "The Outsider," and "The Misfit." You can download small versions of them for free from  urlLink official site  or you can spend some cash and buy yourself the biggest O.C. posters on the block.   urlLink Take a look .  And why isn't there one for Summer, but there's one for Stupid Luke? Where's the justice?

      For the ladies, an  urlLink interview  with Adam Brody (Seth Cohen):   "As the show goes on, Seth is becoming more like me and that's from Josh [Schwartz, creator/writer] knowing me and writing it more to me, and me looking at it at and making it more like me," said 23-year-old Brody, of his nerdy-yet-cool "misfit" character.   And for the guys,  urlLink vote  for your favorite lady in  The O.C. ! You know who has my vote!

      I know you're all feeling pretty desperate for a new episode right now. So what do you do? I'll tell you what you do...  ...print out the picture below, then cut out the figure and clothes for your very own Ryan Atwood Action Figure! BAM! That's right! Now you and Ryan can act out stories of your own! He comes with pattented "wife-beater," his old black jacket and hooded sweatshirt, his work shirt, leather necklace, and a pair of nice jeans! And all for FREE!  But it gets better. In the upcoming weeks, we'll be offering the rest of the cast, from Summer to Sandy. Plus we'll be putting up new Audioblogs of classic  O.C.  scenes in case your imagination needs a jump start!       Have fun, and don't ever say that Buzz wasn't there for you in your time of need. And keep those scissors pointed down! The last thing you need is to be watching the  The O.C.  in the hospital!

      You guys remember when Luke traveled back in time to fight the Spanish Conquistadors? Man that was awesome.  Anyway, I finally got some reader mail and I thought that it would be swell of me to take some time and reply to such a devoted Pool House fan.   To:  Buzz Rodell  From:  Jonathon Potter III  Subject:  Lower Your Mortgage !CN$2R   Dear Mr. Rodell,  Are you tired of your skyrocketing mortgage payments? Are you in severe debt? Can you barely afford the clothes on your back?  Well for a minimal fee, our staff of trained accountants can help you work your way out of debt and on to your first million dollars! That's right, you could have one million dollars!  All you have to do to have the house of your dreams and beautiful women, is click the URL below and contact one of our financial specialists!  [URL BLOCKED]  What are you waiting for? Click today!  Sincerely,  Jonathon Potter III CEO Money Wharehouse    ------------------------------  Dear John P.,  First let me say how honored I am that a man of your business stature is a fan of  The O.C. , it's not everyday you hear of CEOs enjoying teen dramas.  Let's answer your first question, "Are you tired of your skyrocketing mortgage payments?" And I think that's a question that's on everyone's mind. I really do think Marissa and Ryan will get together soon. Marissa is becoming aware that even though Ryan is the "bad boy," that perhaps he's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. She knows that Ryan already treats her better that Luke does.  "Are you in severe debt?" Another excellent question. Anna Stern should be coming back into the picture soon. She sailed of to Thaiti, but should come back when school starts. I believe Seth is pretty deep in this Summer fantasy and that Summer does carry some feeling for Seth deep in her heart. However, when Anna returns, that could bring on a Summer vs. Anna battle. Anna being the girl who has a lot in common with Seth, and Summer being the object of Seth's desire. It could turn into "Catfight Central."  And finally, "Can you barely afford the clothes on your back?" It's true. Peter Gallagher kicks so much ass that the small screen can barely contain him. He's taken the character of Sandy Cohen and shown us that Sandy is the unrecognized king of Newport. But Sandy is going to be tested on several occasions, from his wife, to his job. All hail the King.  Thanks for taking time to write me Jonathon, I'm always glad to speak to the fans and keep them in the loop. Tate Donovan just called and sends his best to you and your family. And you didn't ask in your e-mail, but I'll be sending you an autographed glossy of the Buzzer in the mail.  Thank you and rock on, Buzz Rodell

      Luke climbed back into his truck at the hotel and he knew that his actions tonight would never be forgotten by Marissa. His mind clouded from the beer and Mexico night, Luke kept questioning his feelings about Marissa.  "Do I love her? Does she love me? Where did I go wrong?"  There were no answers for Luke there.  He packed his bags and decided to head out of Tijuana and get back home for some real rest before school started. It was somewhere around 2am when Luke headed north freeway.  Hours into his drive, Luke began to doze off. His head slowly collapsing forward, then snapping back to consciousness.  "Woah there Big Luke, this clearly isn't a place to crash and burn." There was nothing but darkness ahead of Luke's headlights.  Out of nowhere, a deer like creature pounced onto the roadway. In a panic, Luke veered his truck to the right to avoid the animal. Instead of crashing into the ditch, a bright flash of light engulfed Luke and the truck.  Luke woke up surrounded by dense forest and massive trees.  "Where am I?" Luke stepped out of his truck and grabbed his cell phone. There was no signal to call with. "How did I get...where ever this is?"  Luke walked around the truck, looking into the woods. He could only come up with one rational answer.  Time travel.  "The bright light must have saved me from crashing into that ditch, but simultaneously transported me into another year!"  Luke came to figure that in the dry desert air, the negative ions generated from the rubber wheels must have pulled open the fabric of time and brought him to an unknown point in history.  "Now all I have to do...is get home."  That's when Luke heard the shaft of a wooden arrow whoosh past the right side of his head and bounce off the aluminum driver door.  "What the...?"  Emerging from the woods was a small army of Spanish soldiers in search of gold from the native Mexicans Indians. Luke leapt into the truck and started the engine as the soldiers arrived and began attacking the truck with their swords.  Luke punched the gas petal, making the engine roar and spinning the rear wheels. The noise of the huge V-8 and the spray of loose dirt startled the horses and knocked a few Spaniards to the ground.  "HA! American made, baby! WOO!"  Luke raced through the woods, trees and bushes coming within inches of the truck. He came crashing out of the woods and into wide open plains. 1000 horsemen followed. Ahead, Luke saw his escape. A flowing river had worn the landscape into a canyon and Luke hoped to lose the soldiers by driving close to the canyon's edge.  Arrows beat against the glass and the soldiers were catching up. Luke's truck flew in the air and collided against the stony ground. The canyon was quickly approaching.  "Three, two, one...! Now!"  Luke slammed the gas and swerved this truck to the right. The back end came sliding around in the loose red dirt. For a moment, it seemed to have worked!  "Yeah! Alright! Suck that you Chino Spaniards!"  But the truck's back end continued to slide. Luke tried to straighten it out, but it was too late. The rear of the truck slipped over the edge.  The front wheels clawed at the ground, but it was no use. Luke grabbed the steering wheel and closed his eyes. The Spaniards gazed at the metal beast tumbling into the canon.  "Hasta la vista, diablo!"  Suddenly, the canyon flooded with white light. Again, Luke was swallowed up into the fabrics of time.  Luke woke up, lying in a bed. In his mind he thought, "Am I home?" There was someone sitting across from him. Luke spoke, "Mom, is that you?"  "There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost 9 hours now." The person replied.  "I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible." Luke sat up slowly and touched his aching head.  "Well, you're safe and sound, now, back in good old 1955."  To be continued............?

      Today is Friday, and you know what that means? It means  a.)  I don't have to work tomorrow (can I get a “BOOYAH!” from the readers?) and  b.)  a new O.C. episode in four days.  And you know what I would do this weekend if I was you? I'd go home and sleep well, take time to go outside and enjoy the end of summer. Because in four days...The O.C. will start driving you mad.  You'll awake in cold sweats at 2am what's going to happen next. What about school? What about Jimmy Coop's BIGGEST mistake? What about Anna Stern? Is everyone going to make it back from T.J. alive? Could Luke suck at dating any more? ARG!  I know this because it happened to me. I saw "The Escape" (the upcoming 'sode) and nearly went MAD waiting to see, "The Rescue." But I only had to wait two weeks...you're going to have to wait SIX...  My name is Buzz Rodell, and I'm an O.C. junkie.  [" Hello Buzz. "]

"The success of this show has proved to be a tremendous first step towards FOX's stated goal of a year-round programming strategy ."

      I've come up with the PERFECT season ending cliffhanger for The O.C., picture this:   Marissa, Ryan, Seth and Summer are relaxing on the beach while Sandy is out catching some massive waves. The kids joke about recent shark sightings in along the O.C. coast.   Seth turns to Summer, "I heard they're the size of Land Rovers. They'd easily pop you like a yuppie biscuit."   Summer peeks over the top of her sunglasses, "Biscuits...eeew!" Ryan and Marissa chuckle.  Sandy Cohen is enjoying his surfing, he's tearing these waves up with some extreme moves, like standing back flips while he's shooting the pipe. Then suddenly, his board slams across something huge in the water and he eats a huge face-full of surf.   But Sandy doesn't come to the surface.   Marissa speaks up, "Seth, where's your dad?"   All the kids rise to their feet and search the horizon for Sandy. But they see nothing. Seth yells out into the vast blue, "Daaaad!"   Minutes pass, still no Sandy.   Summer dashes to her Prada handbag and begins frantically looking for her cellphone, "I'm calling 911!" she squeals in a panic.   Ryan grabs her phone from her and looks out to the Pacific, "No wait! There!" Ryan points a chiseled arm out over the water.  Sure enough, there's Sandy Cohen, CRASHING out of the depths and RIDING the biggest great white shark EVER RECORDED!   "I'm Sandy FREAKIN' Cohen! You don't scare me! I was a pro-bono lawyer in CHINO!*"   [ end scene ]   That's gold folks. Just accept it, and move on.   *Please note: The author of this page has no ill feelings about Chino, he’s never even been to Chino.

      Holy crap! Can you believe that Peter friggin' Gallagher was able to  urlLink audio post  here last night? I've always heard that he was an awesome guy, this just proves it!  The voice on the coaching end in that audio message, that was none other than Big Texas. Texas and...The Baron (our webmaster...I couldn't think of a name, but that's what I'm calling him for now) both attended the party and rumor is they have some outstanding video footage. I can't wait to check it out. If we have anything that looks good, I'll push to get it posted up here. Hopefully next time I'm in good health and make that VIP list to get in.  So how'd everyone like episode 106? I've been casing the message boards and common reaction seems to be anti-Marissa's decision to cave into Luke's evil. However I haven't seen much about Summer kissing Seth and her turning a 180 on us, I mean, we're not really supposed to like Summer (please note that The Buzzer will always  like  Summer). And now that it seems Luke all pro-Ryan ("Take it easy, guy."), where's that going to lead us? No more fist fights in the O.C.?  And because I'm still a little sick, I had a dream last night that I saw episode 108. That's the one that going to air October 30th...  ...wait, that wasn't a dream...I  did  see it! BAM!

      Ol' Buzzer here seems to have caught some nasty strain of California head-cold and my systems are running at about 65%. Don't expect much genius from me today kids, all my brilliance is being stopped up in my head by about a ton and a half of mucus.  And due to this cold, I'm having serious doubts about attending tonight's  urlLink viewing party , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't attend (I should be getting part of the profits from this thing for as much as I've been pushing it!).  Maybe if I keep telling myself that I can probably snag a pic of myself shaking hands with Peter Gallagher, then I'll have the strength to make it.  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...[ cough! wheeze! sniffle! ]

      We're live!  The Pool House just hit the west coast like killer waves from an offshore storm! In case you missed it, my name is  urlLink Buzz Rodell  and I'll be your captain on this little boat while we cruise the choppy seas that are Ryan Atwood.  This is perfect timing too, since tomorrow is episode 106, "The Girlfriend." And holy frijoles, this episode is going to cause some waves. So how much should I throw out there to you? I'm sure you've already made your own assumptions from the commercials, but there's a lot more going on in this episode than just Ryan and Marissa.  Let's just say that some people will make a decision that will forever change their lives while other people begin to come around. Trust me, I want to tell you everything, but I'm guessing the Pool House (Pool Haus for our European readers) would be shut down pretty quick.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go home and rest up for tomorrow nights  urlLink viewing party . I'll see you there....but will you see me...?  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! (that's evil laughter by the way)

      Ladies and gentleman, patricians and plebeians, surfers and suits, my name is  Buzz Rodell .  Actually...it's not. It's a pen name. Like Mark Twain. Whatever, that doesn't matter, unless you're sick and looking to stalk me.  So you're probably wondering how I earned the right to be the scribe for this site. Let's just say I'm an "insider," and was chosen because I'm in WICKED love with this little runaway teen-train. I breathe the Cohens, I live the Coopers, I eat Newport Beach...you know what I mean. And what's even better...I get to see this stuff before you do. That's right, sometimes hours, sometimes days before it airs, I'm cruising the pier with Ryan and Seth while you sit at home and wonder what Marissa and Summer are wearing.  But I'm going to do what I can to keep you entertained, keep you talking about this surf story juggernaut, keep you guessing at what's coming.  I'm Buzz Rodell...how do you like me so far?

      So who's exhausted from seven straight hours of playing catch up? Seeing the first few episodes just made me laugh by bringing back the great old lines like, "He's not a criminal mastermind. He's a kid with no one and no where else to go." And you can't forget the entire, "I stole a car...crashed it..." bit. And of course the line that really started it all...  "You know what I like about rich kids...?"  BAM!  "Nothing!"  And now the clock is counting down. By my count, it's about 48 hours, 18 minutes and 19 seconds...right? And it starts out with a bang and just keeps gettin' better!  Alright, I gotta go pilot a chopper and help put out the fires that seem to be burning down my city. Back later.  And Summer...if I should fall while doing my civic duty out there...just know that I'd walk through the same fires to save you any time...  [ Buzz places a long stem rose in his teeth and winks to his fair maiden as he holds haphazardly to the jetty taking him to the fires. ]

       Rodell the Mighty - Part II  (haven't read  urlLink part I  yet?)  Buzz knocked on the door of the Atwood Smithy with what little strength he had left. The heavy wooden door creaked open and a two figures helped bring Buzz and Seth inside. Before the door closed, the smithy owner, Ryan, searched up and down the street. He then closed the door.  Buzz placed Seth on a nearby bed.  "It's good to see you, old friend," Buzz said to Ryan. Ryan smiled and then punched Buzz square in the jaw, knocking him to the ground.  "Good to see you too," Ryan said. Ryan reached out his hands and helped Buzz up to a chair. Ryan's wife-to-be, Marissa, brought a large bucket of water and cups. She smiled softly and tended to Seth who had passed out on the bed.  "I prepared a little food for you, it's on the table," Marissa said to Buzz, "eat it before you sleep tonight."  "We'll talk in the morning, get some rest." Ryan motioned toward another bed for Buzz to rest on.  "I'm sure we will." Buzz replied.  That night, Buzz had a terrible nightmare. The events of the Tomb ambush were still scratching at the walls of his brain. The Tombs were a sacred place guarded by the bravest warriors. Where had they been? Ekul's army seemed to pour out of every possible hole. Dark skeletal faces marching closer and closer! How had Ekul known!?  Buzz quickly sat up, drenched in sweat. He stared out into the darkness, it felt like someone was watching him. A faint glow started to spread from a stool in the corner. It was Summer...she was curled in a corner and crying. Buzz stood up and approached her ghostly figure. She turned slowly and looked at Buzz.  "You have to get out. He knows you're there..."  There was a noise outside and the vision of Summer quickly vanished. Buzz had trouble seeing in the dark after looking into the bright light of Summer's message. He fumbled around in the dark and finally found one of the many swords Ryan had made. Buzz raised the blade and listened.  It was quiet outside. Too quiet...

       Rodell the Mighty - Part I   Buzz dragged his beaten body over another sand dune. His banter filled assistant, Seth, had grown depressingly quiet as they trudged through the desert sun. When they came across the top of the dune, Buzz's face became aglow with hope.  Before them, laid the ocean city of Port of the New.  Two months prior, Buzz had been chosen by the King Cohen, the ruler of Cali of Fornia, to set forth and rescue the kidnapped maiden, Summer of Roberts. King Cohen order his quick mouthed son, Prince Seth, to aid Buzz on his quest.  They have seen the mystic purple river of the Baloodoor forest, they have slain the iron scaled dragons of Dolodak fire passage, and they have climbed mountains high enough to see into the palace of the gods and valleys low enough to see the doorsteps of the devils. But their greatest triumph was escaping from an ambush in the Tombs of the Old Kings.  An evil wizard terrorized the lands. He took what he wished and destroyed any person of village that stood in his path. The wizard's name was Ekul of Diputs. Ekul was both strong in magic and strong in mind. He was a brilliant leader in war tactics and used his black magic to slaughter the innocent. Yet the power hungry always crave more power...this is why Ekul stole the fair Summer from the kingdom of Fornia.  Buzz lifted Seth up on his weak legs, Buzz's own body tremored in weakness. But the sight of the ocean city gave them hope. Buzz knew that an old friend of his still resided in that town and could help them regroup.  Summer had powers that the King kept secret from his people because he knew that she could bring an end to Ekul and his dark tyranny. But somehow the wizard found out about Summer's abilities, and while he was unsure of what her powers were, he knew he couldn't risk her being out of his control. Late in the evening, the dark lord attacked the castle riding high on his black chariot and stole Summer from her chambers. Many of the king's men were killed by Ekul's forces, much of the castle was destroyed.  Buzz wobbled through the crowded village streets with Seth propped up over his shoulder. People stopped to stare at the bloodied warriors yet none offered to help. Buzz didn't need their help because he saw the sign for "Atwood's Smithy" just ahead.  "Hold on Seth...we're almost there..."

      Now I know what you're all thinking out there...  ...how could that  urlLink Cubs fan grab that ball !? Don't worry about it, we shouldn't be blaming him at all. That poor guy just did what 99.8% of ballpark visitors would have done. That's okay though. Tonight we've got Wood on the mound and a curse to break.  And HOLY CRAP, how did I miss  urlLink Peter Gallagher's OFFICIAL site !? Why doesn't the world know about this? And when is PFG going to be in the celebrity chat (which I seem to have forgotten to attend today...oops)?  Now for my excuses...I  swear  I'm trying to get the Seth and Summer action figures done. But due to the fact that my cable modem is toast at home and apparently the cable company has a two repair guys for all of Los Angeles, they're kinda stuck in a virtual world. I'm trying, I really am. I also plan on penning a bunch of stuff this weekend to post throughout the week.  We're about two weeks away kids, and it'll be worth it. Trust me. Now where'd The Baron get too? I have to shake him down for a new episode...  P.S. - The lyrics in yesterday's letter to Summer are the german version of "99 Luftballoons" by Nena. Those who got, you're good. Those who didn't...Buzz shames you.

      The information I know about future episodes has brought some interesting reactions on the  urlLink message boards .  From what I can figure, if I don't tell them more about future eps., I'm to be lathered in maple syrup and then feathered. They've also devised plots to capture me by using my weakness for waffles against me.  Unrelated to abductions, I'm sure many of you have seen the FOX promos with shots from  The O.C.  viewing party last month. The song played over the commercial is "Breathe In" by a band called  urlLink Paloalto . I picked up the CD and I think it's pretty good. I recommend it.  Back to the  urlLink message boards ...it seems The Baron just called in some favors and got the Buzzer a forum of his own...  MWAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA!

Maybe I'll post some AWSOME pictures of me drowning my worries for Coop in delicious mapley goodness.

          Everyone out there okay? How did everyone like "The Secret?" I imagine most of you had your worlds rocked. Never saw that secret coming, did you? You're thinking one thing and the next thing you know, the writers hit you with a bus that came out of nowhere.  I hope everyone picked up on the "math" I did. Pretty interesting, huh? Now Stupid Luke just another member of our little freak family.  So here's the cliched Thankgiving warmness. I hope everyone has a good holiday and I hope all your friends and family are happy. I'll be doing Thanksgiving in Tijuana (because  urlLink someone  didn't call me back), so I won't be posting anything until Monday. Have a good holiday everyone, don't forget to take pictures of your  urlLink Brody turkeys !  And if you need something to entertain yourselves over the break, check out the site for FOX's  urlLink Cracking Up . This show is hilarious with a father character that, dare I say, is almost as awesome as Sandy Cohen...  ...almost.

      Who's ready for tonight? Thankgiving at the Cohen's, baby. And remember what I saw  urlLink when I saw it ? This is a great episode.  And while I have your attention, I hacked into The Baron's computer this afternoon and stole the air dates for upcoming episodes. People on the  urlLink message board  have been asking about any holiday interference (for the American viewers). This should answer your questions...   11/19  - " The Homecoming "  11/26  - " The Secret "  12/03  - " Best Chrismukkah Ever "  12/10  - No Episode  12/17  - " The Countdown "  12/24  - No Episode  And Baron...I saw that folder on your desktop when I hacked your machine. The one named, "I LOVE YOU ANNA STERN!" You might not want The Buckle to find out about that folder...

      ...yaaaawn...  The Maker (now the new name of KFF) managed to steal episode 114, "The Countdown," from under the nose of The Baron. It's the New Year's episode and it's pretty awesome, it opens the door for way more drama down the road. Of course...I can't tell you. We're so far ahead with these episodes that we might need to take a break and catch up!  NOT!  Anyway, I was thinking of content for today and suddenly I remembered the ol' Pool House mail bag. Let's see what's in here...ah! This one looks good:   Dear Buzz Rodell,  Your site is truly terrible. You clearly have the literacy level of a ten year-old and the lame humor to match.  Being something of a celebrity myself, your kind makes me a little be queasy. Feeding off the success of others and ridiculing their efforts. I bet you even have an untrimmed goatee and some kind of leather watch.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a spin in my SWEET Mini-Cooper and then go back and sit in my tower.   Sincerely, - Anonymous    ------------------------------  Dear Anonymous,  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Yours Truly,  Buzz Rodell  P.S. - It's a beard, not a goatee.

      Being that this is my first Thankgiving in California, I don't have anything to decorate my table with this year. So last night, I sat down and did a little cutting and pasting to create the best Thanksgiving centerpiece EVER. Feel free to print yourself out a copy and have Adam Brody gazing longingly at sweet potatoes.      Gobble, gobble.

      Oh Seth, if only I had your powers with the ladies. So many times I've found myself crying to sleep alone...err, uh........nevermind.  So here's a little story. Once upon a time, the rest of America was watching  O.C.  episode 110, "The Perfect Couple." Meanwhile, tucked away from the currently bizarre weather of Los Angeles, Buzz and friends sat cozily and HAD THEIR WORLDS ROCKED BY EPISODE 112, "THE SECRET!"  You know how every time I see a new episode, I say, "This is the BEST  O.C.  episode!" Well...112 is the BEST  O.C.  episode! This is the one. All I can really say about this one is you're standing in the batters box expecting a fastball, when suddenly you're ROCKED by a devastating curveball and it's game over.  Game...over.  And if it wasn't enough the have episode 112 in my possession...it seems the powers that be also passed along...episode 113, "Best Chrismukkah Ever." And I'm pretty sure most of you can figure out what that episode is about.  Wow. What can I say...112, keep your VCRs on standby for that. If my math is correct, it will air the first week of December (this is NOT an official time, just my guess).  Game over man...game OVER.

      Dear Fans of The Pool House,  Hey. How are ya? Good, good. How am I, you ask? I'm doing...okay. For the most part.  I've noticed that a few of you have been unhappy with the amount I've been posting lately, and I'd like to take a second and explain myself.  Late last week, I was out of town. I did a whirlwind tour of Chicago and came back to Los Angeles drained of all my superhuman strength. Physically and mentally drained, I dragged myself back to my desk Monday only to find out that there is a nice stack of work that needs to be done.  And while I love this site and I love giving everyone things to laugh at and ponder, my "real" life comes first, and this week, my "real" life is WHOOPING my alter-ego's butt.  So please be patient. Enjoy the episode tonight, it's a GREAT one. This is the episode where  urlLink Chip  appears.  I'll see you later, I promise.  Sincerely,  - Buzz Rodell  P.S. - The t-shirt I'm wearing in the waffle photo was available to  urlLink FOX  employees (if they knew which strings to pull) and were handed out at the preview party. I'm not sure if there are plans to market them, nor am I sure there are any still available. Hope that answers some other questions.

      I'm back, but not with much force I'm afraid. My vacation was barely a vacation. I saw everyone back home and froze my tail off. It even snowed a little one day. Anyway, I'm regrouping physically and mentally for a few days, but I'm keeping my ears open for news.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to sleep in the office supply closet. Please knock if you need something.

      Oh, all right! I'll post something! Sheesh!  Happy New Year's everyone! Hope the holidays were good and everyone is doing well. I'm just out here, buzzing along, trying to stay out of trouble. Unfortunately, due to my ridonkulous amount of partying, I haven't really been near a computer to check up on anything.  However, I did get a  VERY  sweet looking piece of mail yesterday. I'll get a picture up as soon as I can. I'm also going to try and put together a list of the top 10  O.C.  moments in 2003.  Only about a week until the new episode airs, "The Third Wheel." There really isn't a whole lot to say. I heard episode 116 is floating around, so I'll try and get my hands on that soon.  Anyway, everyone have a happy New Year's celebration, don't do anything the Buzzer wouldn't do.  See you in 2004!

      So I was checking the Pool House mail bag this morning and received a little Christmas greeting from my pal Scoob67 over at the  urlLink message board . She's helped spread the good word of the Pool House as well as plotted to break into my apartment on several occasions. Silly Scoob.   Hiya!  I just wanted to wish you and yours a very special Christmas! Thought I better do it now before you go off for vacation and I miss ya.  Thanks for bringing laughter and fun to the message board. Your hard work and dedication has not gone unnoticed! I didn't know if you open attached files, so just know I did a Summer head on a slinky female as a card for ya! The thought was there!  Be safe and enjoy! Happy ho ho!  - Scoob67   It's good to know that the masses are entertained! Happy holidays everyone! Go hug your neighbor...unless they're creepy and smell bad. Then just send a card.

       Rodell the Mighty - Part III  (read  urlLink Part I ,  urlLink Part II )  Buzz strained to hear anything moving outside, all he could hear was the blood rushing in his ears and Seth's deep breathing while he slept.  Buzz began to lower his sword and wondered if the vision of Summer was really a dream. Off in the distance, the sound of heavy footsteps thumped closer and closer. Buzz raised his sword again.  The footsteps were very slow and very heavy. There was only one monster so cumbersome that walked like that.  "I hate ogres." Buzz whipsered to himself. Buzz cracked a nearby window to look down the road. Sure enough, in the distance was the massive dark form of an ogre, lumbering towards the town.  The creature came to a stop at the edge of the town, and placed a hand on the roof of a pub. "I hate big ogres," Buzz watched as the ogre sniffed the air with it's mashed nose. It was looking for something.  The ogre walked out of Buzz's sight, but he could still hear the massive footsteps trampling around the village. The monster was getting closer.  One of the footsteps shook Seth from his sleep. Through the dark, he could see the Buzz waiting by the window.  "Pssst." Seth whipsered to Buzz. Buzz motioned for him to come over.  "What is it?" Seth crouched behind Buzz trying to look out the window.  "Ogre."  "I hate ogres." Seth pulled a sheild off the wall and grabbed another one of the many swords laying about the smithy. "You suppose he's after us?"  Buzz just looked at Seth.  The footsteps stopped.  Ryan and Marissa crept into the front room to join Seth and Buzz. Ryan was carrying a finely crafted bow with a quiver of arrows on his back. Marissa carried what appeared to be a long metal tube with a wood base.  "What is it?" Ryan whispered to Buzz.  "Ogre." Seth and Buzz replied at the same time.  "I don't know where it went though." Buzz said as he cracked the window open a little more. He felt a warm blast of air against his face. Buzz slowly closed the window.  "What?" Marissa mouthed.  "It's right outside." Buzz said.  Just then, a massive arm swung a club into the side of the house and smashing the wall.

      I just took an  urlLink O.C. Online Trivia Quiz  * . Of course I nailed it, perfect score (if only  The O.C.  had been a college course).  The site told me this:    If you score 90-100:  Obsessed much? You've downloaded the music, taped all the episodes and have already launched an O.C. fan site. Why not start a letter-writing campaign to have the national baseball finals moved to another network so you don't have to go without your O.C. fix.   ...and then that little voice in my head said, "Buzzer, you need to get out more."   * (props go out to BigRed0912 and FunkyMarry21 on the  urlLink message board  for finding the quiz)

      Dear Santa,  It's me again, little Buzz Rodell. It seems like not too long ago I was bouncing on your knee and speaking highly of my desires for Transformers and He-Man.  Okay, so it was Saturday night. But regardless, I'd like to officially submit my list for this year. Are you ready?   1.  new socks  2.  a speaking part on  The O.C.   3.  an autographed picture of Peter Gallagher  4.  world peace  5.  Adam Brody to return my calls  6.  a Teddy Ruxpin  7.  mitten clips  8.  pack of Ryan Atwood wife-beaters  9.  a speaking part on  The O.C.   10.   The O.C.  to be made into a DVD set  So there it is you fat, jolly man. If you have questions, you know where to find me. I understand some of these items might be a little difficult to do, like the mitten clips, but I know you'll do what you can.

      It seems like only yesterday that I was witness to the debonaire  urlLink Adam Brody  and the delectable  urlLink Rachel Bilson .  Okay, so it was yesterday that I was sweating nervously somewhere in the "Religious History" section trying to hammer out an  urlLink audblog  worthy of the event.  I live in Los Angeles, home of  urlLink Hollywood . I've seen many a celebrity doing many a strange thing in this town (I saw  urlLink John Tesh  eating at an  urlLink In-and-Out Burger ). But there's a difference between one celebrity you don't really care about, compared to TWO that you've pretty much spent more time writing about them than you have paying your bills.  Before last night, I would have bet you all $26.13 in my savings account that I would NEVER run into anyone from  The O.C. , let alone the one dude I turned into a Thanksgiving centerpiece. It's a bizarre feeling to know you've talked about these people and celebrated their collective efforts, and you're not sure they even know about your website. They're very much the popular crowd, I'm very much the smelly kid who always has to help the cafeteria lady.  Regardless, it was pretty sweet. And I hope that I've been able to show all of you that saying, "I have an ENTIRE website JUST about YOU!" is not the best way to make friends with your local celebs.  Remember, they're people too and enjoy the goodness of a simple high-five.

Buzz hovers around the sports section close to Brody and Bilson.  Cowardice ensues (sorry it's hard to understand, I was trembling in excitement).   urlLink    urlLink audio post  powered by  urlLink audblog   Buzz has no proof that this actually occured.  PLEASE  take Buzz's word for it. Brody and Bilson were awful...friendly. I mean, I'm not saying anything, but there's friendly and then there's  friendly ...

      1.) I need to congratulate my fanatics in the Buzz Rodell section on the  urlLink message board . They managed to blast through their 10,000th post and are still hammering strong! Good work fans!  2.) Keep  urlLink voting ! I want to get reports of Carpal Tunnel because you people are clicking so much!  3.) The Buzzer is a little scared. His fans on the message board always joked about sneaking into his apartment and stealing  O.C.  episodes (amongst other unspeakable acts), but now it seems a well placed trio of individuals might discover Buzz's true identity. Therefore, I'll be posting from a cave in the Mojave desert until the coast is clear.

       LUKE - IN - TIIIIIIIIIME!   Luke's truck tore through the blue glow that made up the pure fabric of time. He had become accustomed to the glow, this was his tenth charge through time since he  urlLink drove into that ditch outside Tijuana . He'd seen conquistadors, cavemen, an Elvis concert, ancient Rome and he was able to catch the end of Waterloo. And here was again, lost somewhere between histories. His CD player blasted the sweet tunes of his favorite band, Good Charlotte.  Then the turbulence started. Luke had learned that once the ride got bumpy, that's when he was about to crash land somewhere in the past. He sat his seat upright, grabbed hold of the steering wheel and braced for impact.  A small piece of the blue tunnel of light began to pull away from rest. "Here we go." Luke squinted down the tunnel, trying to get some idea of were he was headed.  The truck flew out the mouth of the tunnel and hit wet concrete. The truck began to jackknife sideways, Luke saw the end of a pier coming up fast on the passenger's side. His foot was pressed hard on the brake but the truck continued to slide.  The wheels of the truck slammed hard against a curb at the pier's edge. The truck momentarily tipped up on its side, then smashed back down. Luke sat for a second, taking a deep breath.  "The close calls have GOT to stop."  Luke took a look around. It was night and he was in some darkened portion of a dock, across the lake was a city. It's lights dancing across the waves of the lake. Luke lightly touched the gas pedal and found a dark alley to hide his truck in. He buried it among empty boxes and garbage bags he found scattered about.  He locked the truck with his remote clicker on his keychain and slowly began walking. He stuck to the sides of buildings, deep within the shadows.  He came around the corner of a warehouse, on the ground was a newspaper. The Chicago Tribune. The headline read "St. Valentine's Day Massacre," the date was February 15th, 1929.  "Great." said Luke. "This should be fun."  It was late at night in Chicago, the clock on the Marshall Field's on Michigan Ave. said it was just after 2am. Luke walked down the street, ducking into shadows to avoid other people wandering about. He didn't need to draw attention to himself.  "Chicago sure was a beautiful city in the 30's," Luke said out loud.  A deep voice came from behind him. "The 30's? What are you on about freak? What's with the get up?" Two large men in suits and trench coats lumbered out of an alley.  Luke was scared. "What? Freak? No man, I'm from Los Angeles. You know, Los...Angeles."  "Los Angeles, eh? Bunch of pretty boy freaks out there. All them snobby movie stars. I hate movie stars. Are you a movie star kid?"  "N-N-No sir. Just visiting."  A car came squealing around the corner. Luke and the two goons both looked to see a dark car full of men...the windows rolled down.  "Oh no." Luke said.  "Oh no." One of the goons echoed him.  The barrels of the infamous Tommy Guns snaked out the windows. The two men took off running. Luke unfroze his legs and took off in the direction of the pier. At the next block, the men ran right, Luke decided it might be smarter to run left.  Luke kept running, a few moments later, he heard the sounds of machine guns echoing in the sky. He stopped and looked back.  "That was close." The pier was just ahead. He walked, taking deep breaths.  "Almost home." Luke whispered. Just then, the car that chased him earlier came flying down the pier entrance.  "Just ONCE, I'd like this to be easy!" Luke dove between two warehouses just as the car roared by, machine guns fired and the bullets screamed over Luke.  Luke stood up and ran between the warehouses. He could see the car lights flicker occasionally and he kept running. He was clicking the unlock button on his truck remote furiously.  "Where are you, stupid truck!?" Luke was getting frustrated, the car was still circling the warehouses waiting for him to make a mistake. As he turned a corner, he saw the blinking yellow glow of his truck lights telling him it was unlocked. He jumped in the cab and threw the truck into reverse.  The truck smashed out of the piles of garbage he used as camouflage. The gangster's car came around the corner just in time to have Luke's massive machine crush the front end of their car. Luke jerked the gear shift to drive and punched the gas. The tires slid on the wet pavement.  "Okay, time travel hole, you can show up ANY time now!" Luke looked in his rear view mirror, the car was following him. Shadows were hanging out the window.  "Go truck!" Luke yelled. Machine guns fired from the perusing car. Luke could hear the sound of bullets piercing the body of the truck. One bullet tore through his passenger side mirror.  "I hate the '30s!" Luke slammed on the brakes and spun his truck around to face the on coming car. "Let's play a little chicken! Woooo!" Luke threw his foot down hard on the pedal.  Bullets sparked against the front of the truck. Luke knew his truck was far bigger and he'd win a head-to-head collision. But just as the cars were about to collide, the blue glow appeared.  "You have GOT to be kidding me!" Luke's truck was sucked back into the fabric of time. In his rear view he saw the other car lose control and crash into a warehouse. "Booyah suckers! HAHAHA!"  Luke put his seat back and enjoyed the smooth ride. He could only hope that his next stop was Newport, 2003.

      Holy crap. It's December! When did that happen?  I hope everyone had a great holiday weekend, I know I did. Mexico was Mexincredible. Two nights under the stars, far, far away from the Los Angeles city lights. We kept it under control though, we didn't do T.J. Cooper style, if you know what I'm sayin'.  December people. December. I think my body is still expecting weather like Chicago out here in L.A., I keep checking the skies for huge falling snowflakes.  This week's episode is "Best Chrismukkah Ever," which means the holidays are right around the corner (23 shopping days left people, buy me something  urlLink nice ). I already have an  O.C.  related Christmas picture in my pocket that will pretty much convince all of you that I'm loco, but I've had some requests for others so I'll see what I can do.  I still need another chapter of  urlLink Rodell The Mighty  and I can whip up another  urlLink Luke In Time  for sure. I'll make the next few weeks pretty packed. Especially because writing content is just another reason to keep me away from the shopping insanity of the holidays.  Back soon.

       BUZZ RODELL IS BIGGER THAN BRIT POP-BAND OASIS!   There's more too it than just "Wonderwall."  Anyway, for the second month in a row (or at least the second in a row that I've paid attention to), my little TV related wasteland has pulled in 40,000+ page views. That's fantastic! That's means about 1,300 times a day you uber-fans are checking in to see what filler and fluff I've dropped for your reading pleasure.  While 40,000+ views is outstanding, we're still not a force to be reckoned with. So call your friends, call your family, write notes to your kid's teachers, tell the mailman. Tell the world...The Pool House is waiting.

       WHAT DOES JACK BAUER HAVE TO DO WITH THE  O.C. ?   That's an odd question to ask, I know. And no, I'm not talking about some TV crossover deal where  urlLink Jack Bauer  is stepping into Newport to diffuse the bomb that's building between Seth, Summer and Anna.  I'm talking about " urlLink 24inside ." A new web-only show that interviews crew and cast after an episode have aired.  So you're probably still thinking, "Bauer, Newport...bwah?"  If  24inside  does well, then maybe, just  maybe , one day there could be an  O.C.inside . Wrap your brains around that! That's 15 minutes more of paradise!  Now go! Support  24inside ! Now if you'll excuse me...all this talk about  24  just inspired a new story I have to write...

       BUCK UP LITTLE CAMPER!   So here we are, knee deep in day five of this hiatus. I promise we'll make it through. We've braved the frosty grip of frigid hiatus before, and Uncle Buzzer was right there with his kickass flamethrower busting down the icy walls of alternate programming.  During this break, I'll be adding two more characters to the action figure collection (remember  urlLink Ryan  and  urlLink Marissa ). One character I'm sure I'm doing, the other is still being debated by the Pool House Grand Council. I guess I could get off my ass and add another chapter to " urlLink Rodell the Mighty ." And I already have another " urlLink Luke in Time " that will make all the ones before it look like " urlLink The Dukes of Hazzard " when they brought in the lame cousins.  I have a few other tricks up my sleeve that I need to run past  urlLink The Baron , but I think he'll go for them.  And I know you're all wondering, what happens to Oliver? Well I'm going to get it out of the way right now...     urlLink [CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT!]

       ENTER, THE BARON   For some time now, you've heard me mention a few other names on this site. The one that reappears most often would be The Baron.  I decided that he needs to make himself better known to you, the people, so that you can get a grasp on the massive behind-the-scenes effort that goes on to keep the Pool House smelling chlorine fresh.  So in his own words, I give you, The Baron.   Hi everyone!  My name is...well, my Pool House codename is The Baron. I'm the one who feeds unaired episode tapes to Buzz and other crucial information such as air dates and photos of Summer.  Buzz said he'd like me to throw some personal information in here, so uh, here it goes. I enjoy most light folk music, the heavy stuff doesn't really do it for me. I have a gift for making good fashion choices. I have a soul-patch goatee style that drives the ladies nuts. I used to drive a 1988 Oldsmobile Royal, but I recently traded it in for a sweet Chevy Malibu.  My favorite color is orange. My favorite  O.C.  character is Danny. I enjoy flavored coffees and biscotti. And Mexican food is da bomb.  I also wrote this little rap:  Go O.C.! Go O.C.! Go! You know that the O.C. is my fay-vor-ite show! The call me The Baron, but I don't know why! Peter Gallagher rulez, I love that guy!  I play my game sweet, I play my game low! I'm the Pool House player, and all the ladies know! I pull up to the club in my smokin' Malibu! I'm so cool that my fingers turn blue!  Thanks for listening,  - The Baron   Oh, and The Baron  urlLink fights giant pigs .

       GONE WITH THE WIND   So somewhere in my readjusting to this world, I screwed up the episodes I saw. I saw, "The Rivals" and "The Truth." My bad. Here's the upcoming air dates for  The O.C. :   1/21:  "The Rivals"  1/28:  "The Heights" (repeat)  2/04:  Sorry...no episode...  2/11:  "The Truth"  2/18:  "The Heartbreak"  2/25:  "Buzz Rodell Rules the World"

       YOU KNOW WHO RULES?   Luke does.  Now you're probably asking yourself, is this Buzz Rodell or Buzz Evill? With a statement like, "Luke rules" I'm sure you're can barely handle the pressure of trying to figure out which Buzz is at the helm now.  But rest assured kiddies...it's you're old pal, Buzz Ro- FRICKIN' -DELL!    SHABLAM!    That's right you little ankle biters, I'm back! And I brought a pair of KICKSOMEASS brand boots!  So you're probably wondering a few things. Like how did Buzz Evill get to our universe and how did I find my way back? Being that I have a PhD. in Quantum Physics, I'll give you this simple equation:  Buzz Rodell + sink full of water + plugged in waffle iron = tear in the fabric of reality  Got it? Good. I slipped on some butter that fell on the floor, knocked the waffle iron in the sink, and the next thing I know I’m in some sort of parallel universe where FOX is still showing new episodes of  Herman’s Head . It was mondo-bizarro.  And it’s a good thing I made it back to this universe when I did. It seemed Buzz Evill was about to see Wednesday’s episode, “The Links” and NEXT Wednesday’s episode, “The Truth.” My buddy, The Maker, was faced with both of us Buzzes and using his skill of making things, created a portal device out of his wife’s Hoover vacuum cleaner that sucked up Buzz Evill and spit him back out into the Herman-verse.  Once balance was brought to the universe, we kicked back and watched both episodes. And in the end, I muttered only one thing…  Luke rules.  P.S. - Dear Summer, your main man is back...

       BEST STORY EVER WRITTEN -   Once again, it is I, Buzz Evill! And once again I have come to offer you things that are FAR better than Buzz Rodell could ever create from his pea-sized brain!  I have written my first story to share with you fools. You'd better staple those socks on, because this is going to blow them clear off! Here it goes:   Smart Luke was sitting at a cafeteria table when he saw Ryan and Marissa walk by holding hands. Luke decided he could no longer sit and watch the love of his life, the girl he treated so well, walk away with Stinking Chino.  Smart Luke made his way across the cafeteria. He picked up weak Ryan and dropped him in a garbage can! Then he grabbed Marissa's hand, and they lived happily ever after!   That's story is SO TOTALLY AWESOME! I hope I get a book deal. Seriously, Luke rules, Ryan drools! BOOM! Chew on that for awhile!

       BUZZ EVILL'S WORST WEBSITES OF 2003 LIST -   It is still I, Buzz Evill! Your friend, Buzz Rodell, is still trapped in a parallel dimension and I am still in control of his website!  For your enjoyment, I have compiled my list of 2003's worst websites! Are you ready?   1.  The Pool House - written by Buzz Rodell  That's right! There's only ONE! And it was this site! It's packed full of dribble and mucky-muck! MUCKY-MUCK.  Oh yeah, and don't forget the "hiatus" is over! There's a new episode tonight, I've seen it. It's called "The Third Wheel," and Smart Luke steals the entire episode! Just you watch!  ...And if you don't watch, I, Buzz Evill, will come to your house, eat your food and scare your pets!

       FOOLS! -   I, Buzz Evill, have been reading up on what your Buzz Rodell has written about the  The O.C. ...and it's all garbage! What are all these bad 80's songs to Summer for? And this " urlLink Rodell the Mighty " storyline is just a waste of my time. The only good thing I found was the " urlLink Luke in Time " scribbles.  Seriously...your Buzz Rodell is weak. He clearly has the imagination of a four year-old and horrible taste in women. Plus if I see another Peter Gallagher photo, I might gag.  I got here just in time to save all of you fools!  So let's start the Buzz Evill era off with a bang with a little thing called:    ~ WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED ON THE O.C. ~   Setting: the infamous diner scene from the second episode. You know the one, it appears to be Rodell's favorite. Anyway, it was garbage, it  should  have gone as follows:   LUKE:  You know what I like about poor kids? [ Luke punches Ryan's ugly mug. ]  LUKE:  Nothing!  Hahahaha! That's good television.

I was sucked through the portal into this bizarre realm, and Rodell was sucked into mine.  So now I control the Pool House! MWAHAHAHAHA! Bow before me and prepare to enjoy many boring discussions on why Luke is better than Stupid Ryan...  ...MWAHAHAHAHA!

The club is working to set up the Sandy Cohen Fellowship, a scholarship that will send a selected student to work in the Orange County Public Defender’s Office this summer.   The scholarship was created in honor of Sandy Cohen, the father figure on “The O.C.,” a Boalt Hall graduate and a former Orange County Public Defender.   The club has invited Peter Gallagher, the actor who plays Sandy Cohen, to eventually attend the presentation of the fellowship.   Rock on Boalt! Here's their  urlLink Official Website .

Y el hombre, era él bueno.  ¡Como de costumbre, es hora para un redondo de pistas secretas al episodio siguiente!  ¡Pienso que el hecho de que están en español va a ser bastante malo!  ¡Mwahahahahahaha!  Seth ensambla una unión. Marissa y su mama tienen una falta cercana. Theresa y Lucas la arriesgan toda en un hotel. Caleb hace una llamada del booty.  Eew.

       ALMOST FAMOUS   Okay, so we're almost done with the footage. Just a few more nips and tucks and we'll be square. Probably later this week if The Buckle gets some free time. Trust me...you don't want to anger The Buckle. His face gets all red and his voice gets all high and then...well, it's just not pretty.  Tomorrow is a really good episode. It has ninjas and the CIA and some Russian spies trying to bring back stolen satellite photos from the Norwegians. It's international chaos. And somewhere in all that, an  O.C.  episode happens.  Princess Sparkle gets lucky, Summer gets a charlie horse and tells a secret, Marissa gets totally burned and goes for it on 4th and goal, and Ryan learns that perhaps, home is where the heart is. Hmm...  Newport Ninjas...they're the worst kind.

Anyway, a couple of noteable people making the talk show and late night rounds tonight.  Mischa Barton is on Regis & Kelly, check your local listings. Adam is on Jimmy Kimmel at 12:05pm PST. Melinda Clarke is on Craig Kilborn 12:35pm PST.  There might be more. I'll update if I find them. But until then, look out California, Buzzer has a day off and $6 in his pocket.  BAM!

       PLAN A   So here's the skinny.  The Buckle and The Baron were also on set with me yesterday and over the next few days they're going to piece our video together. Then we'll drop it here. Now Buckle is a busy man, so be patient. In the mean time, I'm going to start writing my account of the days events and I'll post that probably along with the video.  Until then, behave you rascals!  Remeber when I shook Benny Mac's hand?  Nice...

       SIDE JOB   The hands inside the altimeter on his wrist were spinning furiously. From this high, he could clearly see the city lights and the moon glowing off the waves crashing to shore. The roar of the wind across his ears was somewhat soothing after the night he just had.  At about five-thousand feet, Agent Gallagher pulled the rip cord on his parachute. Five-thousand feet was a little high, but he figured he'd take a nice leisurely drop back to earth. A giant black parachute spewed out of his backpack and nicely matched the handsome tuxedo he was wearing.  All it took was twenty minutes. From beginning to end...  Earlier that day, the message came over Peter's cell phone. It had interrupted the scene in the kitchen with Adam about Danny not being funny. Adam made some quick-witted remark about the phone and Peter laughed it off.  The message on the phone read, " SANTA MONICA AIRPORT: 11PM - RUNWAY 3 ."  Filming the latest episode of FOX's super hit,  The O.C. , wrapped around 10pm that night. Gallagher headed to his trailer and locked the door behind him. Peter took a seat at a small table and accessed the internet via his wireless laptop. He had one new e-mail. It was from headquarters.   AGENT GALLAGHER,  AT APPROXIMATELY 2AM, THE FAMOUS RODELL DIAMOND WAS STOLEN FROM THE FIRST BANK OF LOS ANGELES.  OUR CONTACTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE DIAMOND WILL BE FLOWN TO MEXICO THIS EVENING. YOUR MISSION IS TO RETRIEVE THE DIAMOND...  ...AT ANY COST.  SINCERELY,  HQ   Peter grabbed a black backpack from his trailer's closet and headed out the door. On the way out, O.C. creator Josh Schwartz was waiting.  "Excellent scenes today Pete. I was hoping we could -" Josh was interrupted by Peter.  "Sorry J.S., no time. Business." Gallagher jumped over the door of his black convertible BMW M3. Josh just nodded, knowing he'd better not get in front of the PFG train.  Gallagher raced down Santa Monica Boulevard, the city lights bouncing off the car. The music however, was a little odd. Peter pressed the eject button on the CD player. The disc read, "BRODY'S SWEET BADASS MIX."  "So help me...if that kid touches my car one more time..."  Peter pressed the pedal harder.  The clock on the dash read 10:50pm as he pulled up to a secluded corner of the Santa Monica Airport. He finished zipping up his black jumpsuit and climbed through a small hole in the fence. A sign next to him read, "RUNWAY 03."  A small plane sat buzzing at the end of the runway. With more stealth than a bomber, Agent Gallagher moved across the tarmac. He had refined his invisibility skills while training in Japan a few years back.  He came upon the plane and quickly identified there were two persons in the cockpit. The plane lurched forward.  Without a sound, he opened the door and slid in. The back of the plane was filled with camping equipment and food goods. He pressed himself into the shadows, waiting for the right moment. Between the pilot and the passenger was a metal box.  As the plane climbed, Gallagher crept from the shadows. His steady hand opened the metal box, and inside was the Rodell Diamond.  "Wow." Peter mouthed.  The lid of the box creaked and the pilot turned.  "HEY! What the!?" the pilot shouted. The passenger pulled a large knife from his boot!  Before he could take a stab, Gallagher gave him a powerful chop to the arm and the knife clanged to the floor. Peter grabbed hold of the man's jacket around his neck and dished out a powerful punch that knocked the man unconscious.  The plane was still climbing. Peter kicked open the plane's door and pulled the unconscious passenger's rip cord. Then he tossed him from the plane. The parachute opened immediately and the man floated away from the plane. Agent Gallagher looked back to the cockpit to see the pilot searching the dark floor for the knife.  "Oh no you don't!" Peter flew forward with a thunder-packed kick which smacked the pilots head against the controls. Peter pulled him from his seat and the control panel began to spark and smoke. The engine began to sputter. Peter pulled the pilot's rip cord. As he pushed the man out the door, the plane shook and threw Gallagher to the floor. The metal box fell too.  The Rodell Diamond spilled out of the box and rolled out the door. Agent Gallagher stood up, and ripped off the black jumpsuit to reveal a magnificent tuxedo. He jumped through the door.  The plane turned off into the night sky and Peter raced down towards the tumbling stone. He stretched his arm out and slowly caught up. The rock bounced around in his finger tips before he got a good hold on it. He slowly reached back and placed the Rodell Diamond into a pouch around his waist. He checked the altimeter on his wrist, and pulled the cord.  Gallagher maneuvered the parachute along the coast. There was a huge bonfire ahead, that was his destination.  He landed quietly on the beach, hidden by the dark of night. As he approached the fire, a voice called out, "Hey! Look who decided to join us!" Ben MacKenzie yelled.  "I love cast parties." Gallagher smiled. “Hey! Where are the smores?”

       THE INTEREST   Like I noted with the  urlLink Seth Action Figure , I made a mistake this weekend and accidentally posted this already. But I took them down quickly and I don't think too many people saw.  Okay, okay. Now to the good stuff. This is the figure you've all been waiting for. Drum roll please...  [ dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda dahda ]  I give you...the Summer Roberts Action Figure! [cymbal crash!]       Oh man, this is probably my best work yet. Let's take a look at what this doll of a doll comes equipped with:  1 - Hot red top, perfect for clubbing 1 - Pair of designer blue jeans 1 - Cell phone for checking in on Cohen 1 - Princess Sparkle so Captain Oats doesn't get lonely 1 - Infamous Wonder Woman costume  And the best accessory EVER...  1 - Buzz Rodell photo to keep on the bedside table  Aww. That's so sweet she'd have a picture of me, isn't it?  So now, the set of four have been completed. Now you can fully recreate the streets of T.J. once again.  But wait...there's more to come. Last night I found time to create another Action Figure. Another one that's close to my heart. Be ready...PFG is coming...

       FIVE TO GO    3/31:  The Nana  4/07:  off  4/14:  The Proposal  4/21:  The Shower  4/28:  The Strip  5/05:  season finale  So that's the schedule we're looking at in the way of episodes left. It's kinda like a handful of Skittles and you've saved all the lemons for last because they're your favorite. And you're just looking at them thinking, "I wish I could savor these, but I must, I MUST, eat them." And you're really not sure you want to eat the Skittles because you've heard that you might not get more for another four months. I love the lemon Skittles.  To be honest, I'm dreading the day after the season finale because it becomes my responsibility to entertain you guys until we're welcomed back to Newport. I'll have a drought of material and a surplus of insanity. I might have to call up an  urlLink old friend  to take some of the weight off of my shoulders.  Don't forget that  urlLink Music From The O.C. - Mix 1  hits stores today. So pack up the friends and/or family and take a trip to your local music shop! Trust me, you'll love it.  I'm a little worried about something though. I haven't received my invite to the cast and crew finale party...maybe they have the wrong address...where's The Key? I wonder if he has my golden ticket...

       THE SETH   Well, first let me say that some of you already saw the following because I made a stupid mistake this weekend. Oh well.  This weekend I created a Seth Cohen Action Figure as well as a very special Summer Roberts Action Figure. So in the style of the  urlLink Ryan  and  urlLink Marissa  Action Figures, I give to you...Seth Cohen...      Seth Cohen comes packaged with the following goodies:  1 - Trendy gray t-shirt with stereo logo (because Seth RAWKS!) 1 - Sweet pair of jeans perfect for the emo look 1 - Cell phone so Summer can keep tabs on him 1 - Rooney CD for the drive home from school 1 - Captain Oats to tell his secrets to 3 - Popular comic books  In case you can't read what it says on the cell phone, it says, "BUZZ'S CELL" because he's calling me to make sure Summer isn't at my crib! SHABAM! And I wasn't sure how to draw "wit" and "sarcasm" to add to the package, so you'll have to fashion those yourself.  So now Ryan, Seth and Marissa can chat it up in your imagination, just like the old days. Remember when Ryan hid in the unfinished house? You can now have Seth dish out the "Luke shaves his chest!" lines again.  I'm great, aren't I? Giving you free Action Figures like this? Well just wait until Wednesday when I deliver the Summer Action Figure from heaven...

       THE REVIEWS   I've got the day off today so I'm just posting and then I'm going out to enjoy a full day of California sun. I combed the message boards for people's reactions to my "The L.A." appearance and the following is what I found:  " I LOVE YOU BUZZ RODELL! Now that I have seen your face, I can finally stalk you and force you to marry me...you're not porky. You're pleasantly plump. " - deathxcab   " When they remake The Godfather, and you know they will, Buzz should play the same character Al Pacino played. Maybe he can be in a remake of Scarface. Buzz has Alpha male written all over him. " - orlock20    " Hey buzz congrats on the video you rock! Anyway i wanted to know how you got on the oc because i would LOVE to be an extra. Also i love your site! " - smoochss   " buzz are you nervous about your television debut??? tonight after the show when the board is full of all the who was that guy i must find him posts just remember the scgs loved you before you were famous! LOL " - bigred0912   " Buzz has the best head bobbing action of anyone I've ever seen on tv. If the head bob was an Olympic event Buzz would be bringing home the gold. " - Punkinboo   " OH buzz was the best looking "extra" they had on the show last night! I cant imagine how the OC has lasted this long without him! He is the Man!... ben n adam better watch out, he'll steal the show away from them!!! " - scoob67   " Usually we can't wait for the next epi, just so we can gaze at Benjamin McKenzie, but I have to tell ya.... last night we were all staring at the big screen waiting for Mr. Buzz Rodell to appear!!!!! We waited, we watched, and I have to say.... Buzz needs more screen time!!!! Next time maybe give him 5 minutes.... OK??? .... and a few lines.... Yeah!!!! We want more BUZZ!!!!!  - hellomyeggo   " Who was that sexy guy with the chick laying on him??? It's BUZZ!!!!!! What a hottie! He can make me waffles any day! " - Debsicle    " You were awesome in "The L.A" Buzz. I missed the whole "club" part and Ben, cause i was looking for you. When i finally found you, i was so impressed by the way you can dance! WOW! :)... You beat Ben in my heart! Ben!?! Ben who?!?! Buzz, you're the next big thing in Hollywood.. Congratulation and good luck! " - funkymarry21  So I want to thank all my fans for showing support for both myself and  The O.C.  and I promise when Monday rolls around, my 15 minutes will be up and I'll shut up about all the extra hoopla. [ checking watch ] Now if you'll excuse me, I have 6 minutes left.

       13 MINUTES, 8 SECONDS REMAINING   Wow, that 15 minutes really starts to burn fast! So what did everyone think? It was a pretty funny episode, I like when funny-Ryan gets cut loose. Last night's ratings were strong too, 5.3/13 share. Well played.  Buzz has some other things to do today. Like get his picture taken by the MASSIVE  O.C.  billboard out front of FOX (off Pico for you L.A. readers).  I'll be back later, I have to start dropping hints about "The Nana."

       PLEASE BEGIN YOUR 15 MINUTES OF FAME   So in case you haven't noticed...     I'M GONNA BE ON TV TONIGHT!    And now that I've beaten the dead horse, buried it, dug it up again, beat on it some more, buried it again and beat the ground it's buried in, read  urlLink here  if you have no idea what I'm talking about.  I swear this massive ego trip is almost over. After the episode tonight, my 15 minutes begins. I'm sure it'll be the fastest 15 minutes in pseudo-fame history.  So tune in to your local FOX station, 9/8C to be a part of history. Okay, okay. Tune into  The O.C. , but stay for the me.  That was the lamest slogan ever...

       THE BIG QUESTIONS   Do you ever find yourself, sitting around eating a plate of bacon, wearing a 13 year-old Chicago Bears bathrobe that's about five sizes too small, and asking important questions like, "If I was Mischa Barton...what would I put on my celebrity playlist?"  I do.  And now, thanks to the people at Apple, I can see what Mischa would pick for  urlLink her playlist  (must have the superior to all music programs,  urlLink iTunes  to view and sample the link).  I won't give the entire playlist away, but I'm impressed by Mischa's selections. She covers the board with classic hits like "Under My Thumb" by The Rolling Stones and all the way to "Sweet Child O' Mine" by 80's thrashers, Guns N' Roses. The girl has taste...

       THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY- FIVE  SIX   One year ago today, I arrived in Los Angeles.  I packed up my sleek, yet affordable, 2000 Honda Accord and headed west from Chicago. The Maker had flown out a few days before and road tripped back to L.A. with me. At the time,  The O.C.  was just a faint blip on the FOX radar. If you had asked me that day, somewhere outside Denver, if I thought I'd ever be running a fan site for one of the hottest shows on television, I would have probably laughed at you and made you clean the Slim Jim wrappers out of backseat.  So here I am. In just over a year, I managed to not only get caught up in  The O.C.  phenomenon, but I was also able to become some small, under-the-radar part to the whole process. If you had asked me that night, somewhere outside Vegas, if I thought I'd be able to be a part of one of those shows, I would have laughed at you again and made you clean up the Red Bull cans all over the backseat.  If you had asked me at 2am, somewhere outside Bakersfield, if I was going to meet Adam Brody, Ben McKenzie and get a hug from Rachel Bilson, I would have to told you to quit making up names and pass another AC/DC album up from the backseat.  And at this rate, year two is already shaping up to be a great one.  California, here we coooooooooome!

       NY ON THE  O.C.    Yesterday, the New York Times ran a great article aboot Josh Schwartz, creator of  The O.C. .    It has been quite a year for Mr. Schwartz. Almost overnight, the 27-year-old has gone from obscure screenwriter to the youngest person in network history to create and produce his own one-hour series. The show, broadcast on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (8 p.m. Central), is the season's highest-ranked new drama in the coveted 12-17 and 18-34 age brackets. Since it went on the air last August, Mr. Schwartz's script for the pilot has been nominated for a Writer's Guild Award, and he was signed to a multimillion-dollar deal by Warner Brothers to keep him producing "The O.C." and developing new shows.   Read the  urlLink full article . I'm not jealous at all...nope. Oh sure, he's written a hit TV show...but was he ever been an extra for a day? Let's check the scores:     EXTRA FOR A DAY SCOREBOARD     J. Schwartz  - 0  B. Rodell  - 1  That's what we in the "biz" like to call, "getting schooled."

       THE DEBUT   Plenty of good things to talk about here today so let's get to the square dance, pretty peoples.  First topic of discussion, Canada. Sure, we've screwed them with our pollution and family vacations, and they've sought revenge in the form of dumping their laundromat unfriendly coinage into our monetary system. But tonight, they're my bestest friends.  Tonight, episode 122, "The Buzz Rodell," er, I mean, "The L.A." airs in our little brother to the north, eh? And I'm sure they're all aboot ready to see  urlLink my television debut . Get your VCRs ready, eh? The Buzz is aboot to be on television! Eh? Aboot, eh? Colour. Flavour. Eh? Oot.  Next topic, The Baron passed along a copy of  urlLink Music From The O.C. - Mix 1  for me to borrow this weekend and absorb. And absorb I did.  Now, I just had a pre-release version, so it didn't have all the goodies that the final version did (cast and crew commentary, etc.). All I had was twelve magical tracks that moved so well between each other that it really took me by surprise. Each song triggered the little VCR in my head and played back whatever   O.C.  scene I could remember (Track one...Summer in a bikini. Track two...Summer in Tijuana...you get the idea). What's even better about this CD is that most of these bands are flying just below the radar of commercial radio so they're fresh bands with fresh sounds. It's SO worth picking up when it hits shelves on Tuesday, March 30th. The Baron also just told me that they'll be using different songs from the CD for the  urlLink Official Site intro song  for the next few weeks as a sampler. Kinda like a chimichanga platter.  Moving on, The Maker brought home episode 123, "The Nana" this weekend and of course we watched it. You don't just bring a yet-to-air episode of  The O.C.  home and NOT watch it, do you? That would be like Ben McKenzie calling you for lunch and you saying, "Uh, no. I'm just going to stay here and eat this TV dinner I found in the back of my freezer." But I wouldn’t know because Ben never calls…  Anyway, as usual, I can't say much about the episode because I don't like giving secrets away like that. I'll write some clues for it next week, but I can say it was an excellent episode. I think I can say this...   RYAN:  So what do you think about Chino?  MARISSA:  I think I can get in more trouble where I'm from.  Flashback to the pilot if you're having trouble with that one.  That's all I've got for now. I'm going to comb through my archives this week and see what I've promised you guys and never delivered on. I'm sure there's enough of that to keep my busy.  Aboot, eh? Gretzky, eh?

       CAN'T STOP THE ROCK   So not only did  urlLink my behind the scenes video  debut today, but the site for the  urlLink Music From The O.C.  is up and running.  It has some great cast photos as well as the hint that there could be three mixed CDs on their way. Hopefully The Baron is getting his hands on an advanced copy for me to review...right Baron? Right?

Friday night, I returned to the scene of my first  O.C.  encounter with  urlLink Adam and Rachel  (back before they knew who I was). However, they weren't there. Saturday night, I saw  urlLink Chris Carmack  grocery shopping. And most importantly, Sunday night I saw episode 122, "The L.A."  In case you're just now starting to read this site, let me welcome you from your long stay under that rock. Episode 122 is an important one for me, because it marks my television debut. I was lucky enough to  urlLink be an extra  while  The O.C.  was filming on location. And now, almost a month later, I was able to see the usual rough cut format of the episode.  So there's really two questions that you should be thinking:   1.  What happens in "The L.A." and...  2.  How did Buzz look?  I'll answer the more important question first...  ...I looked AWESOME. Every hair in place, a gorgeous smile, and a pair of deep brown eyes that would knock Rachel Bilson on her cute little tushy. I can't wait for the world to see.  Oh, and now for the other question about some little show or something. Because the show is still a week out, I'm going to make these extra crazy. Let's see what I've got in my magic bag...   Ryan becomes a celebrity. Hailey sends her love from Club Med. The Brows and The Banker need The Bully. Summer is with Seth and yet not Seth. Seth battles dew. The best looking guy EVER appears. Luke is at the Cohens...without Ryan or Seth. Ryan was looking for his watch and still had bad timing. Seth is with Summer and yet not Summer. Jim Coop! To the rescue!  Okay, enough of that. I think those should be just vague enough to make you guys thirsty and confused. And to think I was going to jumble those on top of everything else...maybe next time.  I haven't talked to The Baron today, but I'll see if I can get an update on my little video. Back later if I have good news. And maybe if you all behave, I'll find it in my heart to drop and new picture from episode 122 later this week.  Be good.

       WHEN YOU WAKE UP FEELING OLD   So I've been checking around other  O.C.  related sites and message boards this weekend. Something I've noticed is that a few people have mentioned  urlLink this post  where I wrote the farewell lyrics to Anna.  I'm starting to feel old because almost none of them recognized the song to really be "Candle in the Wind" by Elton John. I've only written  urlLink one original poem  so far.  Note to today's youth: It's not too late! You can still hear the songs of the 80's! Back when music was truly great! Go! Go now!

       IT'S 7:30PM ON A SATURDAY...   ...do you know where your  urlLink Chris Carmack  is?  I DO! The Buzzer needed some "adult beverages" to enjoy a few hockey games that are on tonight. So I threw on a baseball hat and headed out to our friendly local grocery store. Sure enough, while I'm using the space age technology of the self-check out lanes, Chris is right across from me. LUUUUKE!  Of course, I didn't get to meet Chris the day I was an extra, so I just sat back and thought, "This is the way we do things in Los Angeles!"

       THE AWARD FOR BEST EXTRA IN AN EPISODE OF THE O.C. GOES TO   ME! Frickin' ME! HAHAHA!  Er, umm, excuse me. I got a little carried away. So even though The Baron is back in Vegas causing all sorts o' mischief, The Maker rummaged through his desk and found a copy of episode 122. Oh yes, THAT episode. You know the one, it's more famously known as "The Buzz Rodell."  Okay, okay, so it’s really called "The L.A.," and this boy is gonna be watching it this weekend. I’ll tell you all how glorious I look later.  MWAHAHAHAHAHA!

      I listen to our favorite song, Playing on the radio. Hear the DJ say loves a game Of easy come and easy go. But I wonder does he know, Has he ever felt like this? And I know you'd be here right now, If I could have let you know somehow, I guess...  Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song, Summer, every rose has its thorn... - Buzz Rodell

       PETER GALLAGHER, A MAN WITH A PLAN   Last Tuesday night, my friends (a.k.a. the cast of  The O.C. ) had an evening at Los Angeles'  urlLink Museum of Television and Radio .  However, I didn't get to go...  When the show's producers and creators were asked what they were going to do if the  O.C.  wasn't holding its own, the following took place:   "The shock for me is that we've been allowed to get away with it," he says. "I fully expected a Plan B, where the adult stories would get smaller and smaller."  Gallagher feigns shock at this remark, causing Schwartz to shush Heinberg: "You're not supposed to tell them about Plan B."  "I have a  urlLink Plan C ," Gallagher says.

       THE LUKE AND THE FURIOUS   Chris Carmack, who plays Pool House favorite Luke, has signed on to do a film for the USA network called,  The Last Ride .   "The Last Ride" is set in motion when Ronnie (Hopper) gets out of prison after serving a 30-year sentence. He hits the streets seeking vengeance against Darryl (Fred Ward, "The Right Stuff"), the cop who arrested him. Complicating matters is the fact that Darryl adopted Ronnie's son Aaron (Will Patton, "Remember the Titans"), who's now a cop as well.  Carmack plays Aaron's son Matt, who idolizes his grandfather and wants to help Ronnie carry out his plan.   Read the full article at  urlLink Zap2it.com .

       BUZZ RETURNS TO THE WINDY CITY   I'm going home next week to sweet home Chicago. I'm leaving tomorrow and I'll be back Monday the 10th.  While I'm gone, I've left my beloved Pool House in the hands of The Baron and The Maker. I honestly have no idea what those two clowns are going to throw down on this site, so if you have a heart condition or you're under the age of 18, don't say I didn't warn you.  Seriously guys. No keggers, don't play ball in the house, water the plants, and don't touch my Hummels.  I'll kick your sweet little asses if you touch the Hummels.  Okay everyone. Enjoy the finale and then buckle up. We've got a long summer infront of us and I plan on opening up a can of WHOOP-CALEB on summer break...   SHABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

       THE BILSON   I'm still completely engulfed by the  urlLink season finale . I wandered around my apartment this morning mumbling to myself, "How could he..., when will he..., OH NO, I can't believe she..., UGH! He didn't have to..." I know it's a cliche that's been beaten to death...but this WILL be the finale that America is talking about...  Okay, let's get to the last entry of my "Finale Fun" series.  So there I was, just sitting high above our little blue planet on my own personal happy-fluffy cloud. I had managed to glide through my interviews in such a way that I surprised myself every time we wrapped one up. Who was that handsome devil talking to Tate Donovan? Oh yeah...it was me!  It was after Adam Brody that I made my mistake. After Brody, I turned the Buzz Wagon onto Easy Street, turned on the cruise control and put my feet up on the dashboard. Crusin'.  What I didn't see, were the dark storm clouds moving in over Easy Street (Easy Street has a lot of big Maple trees). I had no idea what was coming.  Rachel  urlLink bop-bop-bopped  her way in. The last time I saw The Bilson was of course while doing the extra gig. During that visit, I saw her single handedly take  urlLink The Baron  down in a question and answer segment. Poor guy never saw it coming. So when it was my turn, my ego made the mistake of saying, "I'm not going to Baron this one..."  However, I would be wrong. Severely wrong.  All I really remember was the camera turned on, I said something, she said something, she laughed, and that was it. Game over. Not only had she knocked me off my horse, but she did it in such a way that the horse left and there was no way I was going to recover. I had been Baroned, very badly Baroned (sorry buddy).  The rest of the interview, which wasn't really an interview anymore,  was still fun. Like the rest of the cast, you can just tell she's having fun and that fun is infectious. I've since watched the footage closer than John Madden watches games during football season. I know where I got blitzed, and it won't happen again.

       WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?   I was going to talk about this tomorrow night before I handed the keys to the Pool House over to The Maker and The Baron, but I just can't keep this in.  Tonight I went over to The Maker's place and we watched, "The Ties,"  The O.C.'s  first season finale. I was completely unprepared for what I was about to see. And I want SO badly to tell you everything because this episode's ending is just SO perfect and amazing. I don't even know where to begin, the clues I wrote down don't even do the entire thing justice. I had things like, "Note to self, hang with carnies," and one word hints like, "puuuudding." Nothing works, nothing sums it up without giving it away. I want you to be just as awed as I was.  All I think I can say right now is get ready. I suggest the following:   1.)  Buy TWO boxes of tissues, even The Buzzer got a little misty.  2.)  Make sure that it's just YOU and  The O.C.   3.)  Call everyone you know, FORCE them to watch this one.  4.)  Be ready to smile.  5.)  Be ready to cry.  6.)  Be ready to scream.  ...The Ties is coming and I'm sure I can tell you right now...you're just not ready.

       DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS   Even though it was just my first time interviewing celebrities (the Amanda Righetti interview from "The L.A." will forever be locked in a vault and unseen by the public), I learned quickly that if I ask a stupid question, I'm  toast. And being that this cast has probably been grilled about their personal history three or four times a week since the show started, I didn't want to end their  first season with, "So, how are you and your character alike?"  I don't want to give too much away from the interview with McKenzie because it was probably my best one (no offense, Tate). Ben doesn't behave like he's a celebrity or that he's one of the main characters of a popular teen drama. He's just another dude, giving an interview in cowboy boots.  In came Benny Mac, on the attack. Wearing a fancy suit, he flashed brown cowboy boot. He put on his game face for an interview in The Buzzer's home base. Mac Attack was cool even though Buzz was a fool. Ryan Atwood! From da Chino hood!  Okay, I ran out of rhymes. I got nothin'.  Ben McKenzie, the Pool House's favorite backwards walker...    urlLink      click photo to enlarge   [ Ryan is walking backwards ] "I stole a car. Crashed it. Actually, my brother did. Since he had a gun and drugs on him, he's in jail. I got out, and my mom threw me out. She was pissed off and drunk. So Mr. Cohen took me in."

       A-DAM BRO-DEE   The way The Maker was calling out names was hilarious. He would say the name with far more enunciation than was actually needed as if my brain was so clouded by nervousness that I wouldn't know who was staring me in the face (albeit, on several occasions I almost called them by their character names...oops). So anyway, The Maker pokes his mug in my tent, looks me in the eyes and boldly sounds out the name, "A-dam Bro-dee."  That's great, buddy. I know you've got my back if there's ever a street fight and it turns into a pronunciation showdown.  Adam walks in and parks himself on my couch. Now, I'm not really sure what to expect from Brody because I know he often gives very animated interviews. So I'm thinking, I'll be the pale, nerdy kid sitting on top of the dunk tank, and he'll be the six-foot eight-inch super jock throwing basketballs at the bulls-eye to sink me.  A single bead of sweat begins to form above the Buzzer's right brow...  "Hey man, how's it going." Adam Brody is everything you've heard about it. A cool, collected guy who delivers wit with a straight face that puts just enough bite on his punches. Adam Brody is the guy that you want speaking at your wedding as your best man so that for just a few minutes no one is looking at you and everyone is wondering, "What could this guy say that's going to TOTALLY embarrass the groom and shock the bride's parents!?" The kid is an ace and I was glad that he took time to answer my ridiculous questions. I'm still not sorry about the  urlLink turkey  though...

       GALLAGHER, GIVER OF GREAT THINGS   Back in  urlLink February , I noted that the  urlLink Bloat Hall School of Law  had started a club and scholarship in honor of Peter Gallagher's character, Sandy Cohen.  Last Thursday,  urlLink Gallagher sealed the deal . Not only did he present the scholarship, but also added half of the total out of his own pocket to the final total of the scholarship (did I lose you?).  The Oakland Tribune quotes PFG as saying, "I didn't want to just throw some cabbage their way. These are people about to go out into the world to make a positive impact."

       MS. MISCHA B. AND ME   The Buckle was filming "B-roll" in a dark, secluded corner of the tent. He quietly stood  guard, letting his camera roll and getting more footage to round out the final video.  Mischa B. saunters in. Almost instinctively, The Buckle's already barrel chest, seemed to triple in size and he took a stance that declared "I might be doing B-roll tonight, but usually I'm KING of the FOX.com video jungle, baby." I sprayed him a few times with the "punishment" water bottle and he backed down. That's a good Buckle.  When Mischa walked into the tent, you could almost see the confidence radiating off of her super model frame. She might be young, but you can tell she knows what she's doing and that her shoes that night were not fashion accessories, but fashion STRATEGIES.  Ms. Barton speaks with a surprising eloquence in her voice that makes you keep thinking, "Holy crap, she's ONLY 18?" There's a tone to her voice that's so affirmative that she could probably sell ice to Eskimos. And let me tell you something, those would be some happy Eskimos. The last time I was that close to a girl that beautiful was probably senior year of high school when our homecoming queen clipped me with her Mazda Miata while I was walking through our school's parking lot. Sarah Jacobson, if you're reading, you are forgiven.  Mischa is, without a doubt, probably the most recognized face in  The O.C.  cast. Between magazine covers, TV ads and prints ads, she's everywhere these days. Which isn't a bad thing at all. The kid is cemented in the "scene" now and I think she's going to be around for a lot longer.  Mischa Barton, the Pool House's girl next door.    urlLink      click photo to enlarge

       MAN ON FIRE   In the economic world of Hollywood, California, Josh Schwartz is now valued higher than botox and BMW's. When  The O.C.  bulldozed onto FOX's airwaves in August of '03, he went from "some guy" to "The Creator" overnight. Because he is a man-in-demand, again, I couldn't help but be nervous about meeting this guy. He started it all. He's like...the father. If there was no J. Schwartz...there would be no Buzz Rodell's Pool House...  ...woah.  I met the good Mr. Schwartz briefly as he passed by while I was doing  urlLink my stint as an extra  on the set, but I didn't get to say anything coherent. But Josh is apparently familiar with Buzz and the Buzzer's works here in the Pool House, so that calmed my nerves down and I was ready to go.  Josh works like a madman for his show. He sews a little bit of his soul into each episode. But when he sat down on the couch, you'd swear that he was the cool guy with the old Mustang just came to talk about how the Cubs were doing. If you didn't know who he was, you'd never guess that he was the father of our little addiction. He's collected, he's funny, he knows how to guide the conversation. You can tell he loves what he's doing because of the tone he talks about it. Everything is exciting, the cast is awesome, you get caught up in that vibe and you suddenly want to build a boat, steal the heart of the popular hottie and sail to a tropical island.  The interview was going well, and I threw out a question that changed the entire path of conversation. I asked something along the lines of, "When can we expect Danny to come back?"  No less than three minutes later, Hurricane Harrison came to the Buzz Hut.  You can't help but watch Bret Harrison, in part because you're waiting to see what he's going to say next, but also you're just waiting to see if he might explode. The guy is seriously 100% energy and exhausted me trying to keep up with him and Josh. Harrison was/is hilarious, . I hope we can share that video with you. It's like running a marathon.

       THE BETTER HALF OF JULIE COOPER   During the night, The Maker would stick his head in the tent to tell me who was coming up so I could flip through my cards and be ready. I was still recovering from my first crash-and-burn interview of the evening when The Maker called out, " urlLink Melinda Clarke ."  I couldn't help but be nervous. I was about to interview this gorgeous starlet, and I'm decked out in blue jeans and still trying to regain my footing in the interview universe. Melinda enters in a stunning red dress and she's seemingly floating in on the cool breeze from outside. I introduce myself, and she says, "YOU'RE Buzz Rodell?" The connection is made, it's all good from here.  Melinda was amazing. She couldn't be farther from her Julie Cooper character. There's such a warmth in her voice and a good nature about her that you find yourself smiling for no reason. If my real mom wouldn't be seriously pissed off, I'd try to get Melinda to adopt me. We threw a few  O.C.  related questions at her and then chatted like old high school pals catching up. I'd be the pimply chess club kid, she'd be the prom queen.

       THE SCOOP ON JIMMY COOP   When Tate Donovan walked into the interview, I wasn't sure what to expect. This is a man with over twenty years of acting on his resume in both feature films and hit television shows. So honestly, I was a little afraid that Tate might be on the high-and-mighty side of the fence.  I was completely wrong. Tate Donovan talks like he's been your next door neighbor for ten years and he knows that he still needs to return that lawn chair he borrowed for the last 4th of July party. The way he answers questions shows that he's a man who genuinely loves his job and loves the people he works with. Even when we hit him with some ridiculous questions, he laughed and kept feeding great answers.

       THE SEASON ONE FINALE PARTY   Last night, the cast and crew of  The O.C.  held a little party up in Hollywood to celebrate the end of season one. Unfortunately, there wasn't much press at this party because it was just for the cast and crew...  ...but Buzz Rodell and his team of trained specialists were there chatting it up with all the stars of the show!  SHABLAMO!  The party planning crew gave us a great tent with furniture to work with and then our other camera dude, Iron Man, dressed it up and made it look incredible. We took plenty of pictures so I'll be posting a few during the weeks.    urlLink      click picture to enlarge   PFG has my vote of King of Man. That's for sure.  Everyone was SO great. All the actors, along with Josh Schwartz and McG, were amazing and handled our questions like champs. Rachel Bilson totally tossed me from my interview horse, but I'll get her next time. And if I learned anything from last night, it's that...     BRET HARRISON RULES!    HAHA! Anyway, I'm glad I got a chance to do it and I want to tell everyone how the entire night was but then you wouldn't have to wait for the video! So HA!  Now I gotta say my thank yous! Thanks to The Big Boss for believing in the Buzzer. Thanks to  The Buckle for maintaining a skill of making me look GREAT on tape. Thanks to The Maker for keeping me in check and getting me water. And of course, thanks to The Key who tracked down our celeb guests and suckered them into talking with me.  So that's that. We're putting all the video footage together, but there's A LOT. So I'm not going tell you any kind of a date as to when you might get to see it. But you know where to look and you know I'll tell you when that delicious internet cookie is ready to eat...

       WHERE'S BUZZ?   Well, I'm right here. Things have been a bit busy in both Buzzer's real life and his alter-ego. When you've got two worlds grinding together, you don't really have time for fun stuff.  What really makes me sad is that for the second week in a row, I was just too busy to see this week's episode, "The Shower," and concoct some clues for you kids. I really gotta get myself on that tape-delivery list!  However, why I've been busy on the Buzzer side is something really special. I'm not sure I can reveal it just yet, but it's something extra bubbleicious.  I'll be back, I promise.

       NAH NAH NAH NAH, HEY HEY HEY, GOOD BYE     LUKE WARD: August 5th, 2003 - April 14th, 2004   Okay, so Luke didn't die. But I'm still sad to see him go. I'm sure a lot of you are saying, "SAD TO SEE HIM GO!? Look what he's done!"  Well, right. Ol' Luke made some really stupid mistakes in the last few episodes. But here at the Pool House, Luke was a cherished character. Let's take a walk through the archives...  Luke came clamoring into our lives for good when he uttered the best known quote, "Welcome to the O.C., bitch. This is how it's done in Orange County." The first time Luke was mentioned in my Pool house was  urlLink Friday, September 5th , the week he got shot in the arm and wimped about it. Back then, it was easy to despise Luke because we all knew that he was going to the sand in Ryan's bathing suit.  Luke later appeared in the Pool House's very first art piece. On  urlLink September 10th , Buzz Rodell stepped up to Luke Ward and shut him down faster than The Lighthouse's liquor license request to the Newport Liquor Board .  Then came the night Luke was caught cheating on Marissa in T.J. (remember Holly?) and Marissa subsequently downed that bottle of pain killers and proceeded to take the not-so-scenic route through Mey-hee-co. Shortly after that,  urlLink Luke In Time  was born. On his way back from T.J., Luke crashes into a ditch, which just  happens  to be a portal into the past, and ends up battling Conquistadors in old Mexico. Hey...it's not  THAT  crazy.   urlLink Wednesday, November 26th  threw a Caleb-wrench in the We-Hate-Luke machine when Luke's secret about his father was revealed. Suddenly, we felt bad for the jock and he joined up with our trio of misfits.  Luke ended up  urlLink back in time  in early December. This time he was fighting off mobsters in Chicago, circa 1930. Good times.   urlLink December 22nd , Chris Carmack turned 24.  And we can't forget when  urlLink Evil Buzz came to the Pool House . Evil Buzz was a HUGE fan of Luke's bullying antics as well as the  Luke In Time  series. Too bad Evil Buzz was dumb.  The big change took place in  urlLink late January . That was when the Oliver storyline was in full blast. That's when Luke started going to bat for Ryan and wanting to kick Oliver back to sanity. Luke was our buddy now.  Oh, but how could we forget the GREATEST celebration of Luke to ever happen here. Amid all the news of NASA and their wimpy little Mars rovers, I unleashed  urlLink LUKE1 . LUKE1 was not designed to explore Mars, BUT WAIL ON IT SO WE COULD CONQUER IT! MWAHAHAHAHA! Er...umm...sorry. LUKE1 is still currently roaming the face of Mars and pounding on little green faces.  But then the mistakes started. Luke began the affair with  urlLink Julie Cooper  that would lead to his ultimate farewell. Remember when I found  urlLink Luke's valentine to her  on the set? Oh, Luke...if you only knew...  I put my sadness aside just long enough to make a  urlLink sweet Luke Ward  wallpaper which really captured him during his peak time...before he sissied out.  Speak of Luke took a severe dip since then. I saw  urlLink Carmack  at a local grocery store about a month ago, and since then...nothing.  Until today, to say good-bye. Don't cry Luke, it'll be okay. You'll be remembered here because  Luke In Time  will still pop-up every now and again, and I'm working on a "Not-Forgotten Heroes" action figure set of which you'll be included.  Farewell Luke, maybe we'll see you around some day. Keep on truckin'...keep on truckin'.

       ONE OF THE CROWD   For the first time in Pool House history, I haven't been able to see an episode early and give hints to what's coming. Chances are that you've already seen the commercials or went digging around  O.C.  related message boards for spoilers. Maybe I'll get to see it at lunch today if The Baron isn't too busy galavanting around the west coast.  Bueno.

       YOU CAN'T ESCAPE    RYAN:  Look, down there. [ Ryan points toward a table next to the pool ]  SETH:  What? What am I looking at?  RYAN:  Wait...spiked hair...scruffy facial hair. You can't be serious.  SETH:  Seriously, what's his deal? He drove from L.A. just to lurk around?  RYAN:  I guess so.  SETH:  Did he just...?  RYAN:  Share a strawberry milkshake with Summer? Yeah.  SETH:  Oh, that's it. I am SO not giving him my "Sweet Badass Mix" CD.  RYAN:  Yeah.......that'll teach him.

       WALT WHITMAN WHO?   Here's another great fanfic I salvaged from the message boards. This one is brought to us by user  L8trSk8r , and it's GOLD. Enjoy!  It had been two weeks since she had caught Seth making out with Anna behind her back. She was still a little mad about it, but the hurt hadn't lasted long. She realized after much thought that Seth just wasn't the one for her, and that there was still someone out there she was supposed to be with.  Summer sat in a booth at the Ocean View Cafe, sipping her iced tea and reading the menu. She was trying to decide between getting a salad or giving in to her stomach and getting a cheeseburger and fries when one of the waiters neared her table. His name tag read "BUZZ" and he seemed to be slightly nervous about something, but was trying to hide it by pretending to wipe an already clean table adjacent to hers. She looked up and was pleasantly surprised to see that he was cute and dressed well. She smiled at him, and he knocked over a salt shaker. He blushed, gave a crooked grin, and dropped his rag over the spilled salt to cover it up. He walked over to her table and nodded at her.   "Are you ready to order?" he asked, pulling out a pad from his non-feminine apron.  Summer brushed her hair out of her eyes. "I don't know," she said. "I can't between a salad or a cheeseburger."  Buzz gave a half smile. "That's easy. Cheeseburger, any day."   Summer bit her lip doubtfully. "Yeah, but the carbs..."   Buzz looked at her appreciatively. "With your figure? You've got nothing to worry about," he said.   Summer grinned. "Thanks," [ she looked at his nametag ] "Buzz. I'll get the cheeseburger and fries."   Buzz grinned back and jotted it down. "Is that everything?" he asked.   Summer nodded. "Yep! Thanks, Buzz."   Buzz turned smoothly and called over his shoulder. "I'll be right back with your order."   Summer smiled to herself and took another sip of her iced tea. This Buzz guy was pretty cute, and even seemed to like her a little. She thought of what she would say if he asked her out, and decided to say no at first. String him along, make him play the game. If he stood up to her loyalty test, she'd try it out. He seemed dependable.

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY ADAM BRODY   The good Dr. Brody turned a shocking 24 years-old today (SHOCKING). I was going to call you and wish you a happy birthday, but The Key wouldn't budge on handing over your phone number (clever Key...clever).  To celebrate, I thought we'd walk through Pool House history and go through the great Brody moments in no special order:  1.)  urlLink The Seth Action Figure  2.)  urlLink The Adam Brody Thankgiving Turkey  3.)  urlLink Adam Brody Babe Magnet Wallpaper  4.)  urlLink STEVENS TEAM!  5.)  urlLink Buzz Crashes Brody's Party   Happy birthday big boy.

       BECOMING A LITERARY HERO   As with most hit television shows, fans create what is known as "fanfic." They take the characters of the show and put them in new adventures and situations.  Since my  urlLink 1.5 seconds  of TV history occured, I've been popping up in a couple of the fanfics. This one comes from message board user,  Ben_is_hot87 :   Nurse:  Now, you were in the car with Ms. Cooper when she wrecked correct?   Summer:  Yeah we just finished eating lunch at the Crab Shack. See, I had the biggest craving for waffles and syrup, which I only like because this hot guy likes waffles.  Seth:  [ interrupts ] But I don’t like waffles.  Summer:  Cohen, you interrupted my story. Besides, I wasn’t talking about you. Now shut up and let me continue my story.  Seth:  Now Summer, what hot guy is this? Are you having a affair with him?   Nurse:  Excuse me, but I need Ms. Roberts version of what happened this morning.  Seth:  Just a minute nurse.  [ Marissa forgetting about how nervous she is, looks over at Ryan and start to laugh ]   Seth:  What I just want to know if Summer is having a affair.  Summer:  I’ll talk to you at home Cohen [ turns back to the nurse ]  Seth:  [ turns Summer back around ]  Summer:  Seth, his name is Buzz. Buzz Rodell. Are you happy now, Cohen?  Seth:  Yes, yes I am.  Yeah, shut up Seth and let the lady finish her story!  I like where Ben_is_hot87's story is going. I think we all know that it ends with Buzz beating Seth in a bathing suit competition and winning Summer's heart.

       THE HERO   I've been MORE than generous with Action Figures this week (see the full collection:  urlLink Ryan ,  urlLink Marissa ,  urlLink Seth , and my once dear  urlLink Summer ) but I've still got one more in my bag of awesomeness (you shouldn't be surprised though, it's a HUGE bag).  Every now and then, an actor or actress comes along that just reshapes the way you watch television. When they come on the screen, you know that without fail, they will deliver something incredible to you. This actor for me, was Mr. Peter-Frickin'-Gallagher. And while I have poked  urlLink some   urlLink fun  at PFG, he's one of the main reasons I was first drawn to  The O.C.   So without further butt kissing, I give you...Sandy Cohen...       The King of Cohens comes packed with the following gear:  1 - Pro surf board for thrashing waves and  urlLink sharks  1 - Very expensive business suit, perfect for kicking ass in the courtroom 1 - Cell phone to make sure Ryan and Seth actually went to the IMAX movie 1 - Lighthouse menu, The Nana's meatloaf included  And as a special bonus:  1 -  urlLink Rodell Diamond   There you go Mr. Gallagher. With the click of my mouse, I've sent you into the Hall of Pool House fame and secured you a place in Immortality Central.  Ladies and gentleman............PFG. [ Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

       LOS NUMEROS DEL TELEVISION   Awesome.  O.C.  pulled in a 5.1/13 share last night. Very nice.  On a number related note, for the month of March, my little Pool House was viewed 43,000+ times over the 31 day span. That's the highest to date and I have the entire  O.C.  crew to thank for that, from Schwartz to The Baron.  Sandy comes tomorrow.

       YOU'VE BEEN A BAD, BAD BARON!   So I'm probably just as surprised as all of you. I turned on my local FOX affilate and was blindsided by two succulent episodes of  The O.C.  I think my brain exploded and then I was trying to find out what dimension I was in. Had I gone back in time? Where was I? Were the holiday brats bad?  I think my spies fell through on me, oh well. The Baron does have more things going on in his life than just the Pool House. I need to hire an assistant.

       SIDE JOB   Agent Gallagher reached into the black duffel bag next to him and pulled out a small plastic case. With a gloved hand, he pulled out a single Diazepam pill.  "Down the hatch," Gallagher said and followed it up with a quick sip of cold water from his water bottle. He was laid out across the roof of a New York skyscraper with a large sniper rifle in front of him. He crawled forward and looked through the scope that was focused on a payphone about six blocks away. Inside the rifle, a tracking device was ready to be fired.  Gallagher's watch beeped once, 1:00 PM. He looked back at the payphone as a very large, bald man in an expensive suit approached the payphone. The renegade Russians were right on time. In the man's hand was a brown leather briefcase. "Bingo," whispered Gallagher. Now all he had to do was wait for the right moment.  The Diazepam had taken affect in his system now. He mind was clear and his body was calm. Through the scope, he saw the man pick up the phone receiver and speak briefly. However, he seemed angry. Gallagher waited.  As the Russian turned to leave the payphone, a delivery guy on a bike came close to hitting him. The Russian threw this arms in the air and the briefcase flew upwards as well. Gallagher pulled the trigger. A soft pop sound came from the gun and in the chaos, the Russian never felt the tracking device hit the briefcase. Gallagher smiled, then began dismantling the gun and placing the pieces back in the case. When finished, he reached in the black bag and found a small handheld computer that would allow him to follow the tracking device. He turned it on and the screen showed a map of the city and a red dot in the center indicating where the Russian was.  Gallagher stood up, put the device in his pocket, picked up his bags and then turned on his iPod in his pocket. But what came out of the headphones was certainly not Gallagher's tunes. He dropped the bags and pulled out the iPod. "What the...?" He turned it around and on the back was not the " To my beloved Peter, " inscription from his wife, but instead it read:    PROPERTY OF ADAM BRODY SURF OR DIE   "Surf or die? Seriously, if that kid goes in my trailer one more time, I'm having him off'ed." Gallagher tossed Adam's iPod in his duffel bag and headed to the stairs.  The FOX Upfronts were being held at New York's City Center today. Agent Gallagher decided to meet up with the cast at the Upfronts and find the Russian after. He ditched his bags in a secure dumpster where his agency would retrieve them. He called a cab and headed to the Upfronts.  Gallagher paid the cab driver and headed backstage to find the rest of the cast. Brody and McKenzie were standing off to the side. Ben spotted Gallagher, "Dude, where have you been? We tried calling your cellphone."  "Ah, yeah. No service! I need a new cellphone company." Gallagher chuckled.  "And I think this is yours," Brody handed Gallagher his iPod, "and seriously, can you get anymore Sinatra on there?" Brody laughed.  "HA! I've got yours at the hotel," Gallagher replied. Just then his micro sized earpiece buzzed in his ear. The agency had news.  A female voice spoke as Peter pushed his way through the American Idol kids and the cast of Tru Calling. "Agent Gallagher, we have discovered the contents of the briefcase in Russia's possession."  Gallagher slipped out a side door and into an alley. The female voice continued, "Inside the case are blueprints that were stolen from the United States military earlier this week."  "Blueprints of what?" Gallagher questioned.  "A space laser." The voice replied.  "That would mean if this group of renegade Russians were able to build this thing then..." The voice cut Peter off.  "Then they would be an unstoppable force and hold the world in a grip of fear. You MUST retrieve the case IMMEDIATELY!"  Gallagher pulled the tracking computer out of his pocket. He knew there was some time before he was needed on stage, but he wasn't sure where the Russian could be. Gallagher studied the map. Then he realized...  ...the Russian was right behind him!  The Russian took a swing at Gallagher with the briefcase but Gallagher was able to dodge the attack and roll to safety next to a metal dumpster. The Russian seemed to be two feet taller than Gallagher and he charged towards Peter again.  Relying on his martial arts training, Gallagher saw the Russian's moment of weakness. Gallagher swept the leg.  The massive man stumbled and fell head first into the side of the dumpster. Gallagher approached carefully to find the man totally unconscious. Peter used all of his strength to flip the man over the side of the dumpster and buried him among the trash. He then picked up the briefcase and went back inside.  When he came in the side door, he was met by Tate Donovan. "Come on buddy, we're on. What's with the briefcase?"  Gallagher hid the case behind a giant Arrested Development poster, then wiped the sweat off his face and followed the cast on stage.

       SAME AWESOMENESS, NEW DAY   If you haven't heard by now (since I'm about a week behind)  The O.C.  will be moving to  Thursday nights, 8/7c starting in November . So yes, we're looking about five months without  O.C.  and all that means to me is that I really need to get myself a game plan to keep you entertained (or at least those of you who are still out there).  The Buckle and The Maker were lucky enough to go out to FOX's Upfronts last week. Upfronts take place throughout a week in New York city with all the big networks pitching their upcoming line-ups to advertisers. The Maker mentioned something about talking to a few of  The O.C.  kids, as well as another story about getting stuck in the world’s smallest bathroom with Jeffery Tambor (  urlLink Arrested Development  ) and Jason Priestley (  urlLink Tru Calling  ). The Maker said that Gallagher sang a song during  The O.C.  segment, that's magic.  I'll be back later, I have to write more of my  urlLink Season Two, Episode One: According to Buzz .

       SEASON TWO, EPISODE ONE: ACCORDING TO BUZZ - PART III   Need to catch up? Read  urlLink part one  and  urlLink part two .  Ryan jumped off the fence and hit the ground running. He trained all summer for this moment and he wasn’t going to screw it up. They were offering him enough money to take care of not only himself, but Theresa and the baby. As he ran across the dark, dew covered lawn, it crossed his mind that Theresa had named the baby boy, Buzz. They didn’t know anyone named Buzz. Odd.  He could taste the sweat in his mouth. He knew what he was up against and this wasn’t going to be anything easy. All summer he had been working out and bulking up. He could run one hundred yards in about 8 seconds, which in his mind was still too slow.  That summer, Ryan just kept working out and thinking about Newport and the way things used to be. It all seemed too easy and underneath it all, everyone’s true intentions were waiting to surface. Luke was smart and got out first. Sure, he had messed up bad with Julie Cooper, but he made a good choice to go with this father and get out of that town.  Ryan heard dogs and ATVs growling in the distance. They knew he was there. He put his head down and ran faster across the property. Ryan slammed against the wall of a building that was marked  Research Building 2 / Sector 1-B . He pulled out a bag of lock picking tools from his vest and then poked at a lock on a door handle until he heard the click. He opened the door.  “If you even exhale, I’ll kill you.” A small silhouetted figure stood in front of Ryan.  Then the figure spoke again, “Ryan?” Summer stepped out into the light with a gun pointed at Ryan’s chest.  Marissa scoured the bottles of booze in her room trying to find any drop of liquor left. Julie and Cal had been out of town for two weeks, so there was no one around to buy the drinks.  Marissa picked up an empty vodka bottle and glared into it. “Screw this,” she said as she threw the bottle out the window and into the pool. She stormed to her closet door and pulled down a few boxes marked “old clothes.” Inside one box, she pulled out her emergency savings. “Twelve-thousand dollars. That should be more than enough to live well in T.J.”  She picked up the phone and called the bus company to find out the times they left for Mexico. She put a plan together and packed light.  An hour later, she was on a bus headed to T.J., a place that held bad memories for her. But that was a long time ago and worse memories had since filled her life. She just wanted to hide now. About thirty minutes into the bus trip, she fell asleep.  “San Diego, first stop. Everybody off.” The bus driver cackled through the intercom. Marissa rubbed her eyes and looked around. She figured there wouldn’t be another stop after this so she might as well use the nice bathrooms before the got moving again. She stepped off the streets and collided with a taller man singing along to whatever was playing in his MP3 player.  “Hey, watch where you’re going idiot.” Marissa snapped.  The guy turned around and immediately Marissa recognized the curly mopped boy. “Seth?”  “Marissa!?” Seth’s mouth didn’t close after that.  Sandy approached the man known only as “Carlos” while he was sitting at a table and surrounded by barely dressed women. He was laughing loudly and feasting upon three very large chickens.  “Ah, my prized fighter. What can I do for you today Mr. Cohen?” Roared Carlos as his fat lips smacked down on his dinner. Sandy almost couldn’t answer because the sight of Carlos’ food caked face disgusted him.  “I have come for more information about my son.” Sandy spoke silently while nursing the left side of this body. “We had a deal.”  “I understand our deal,  Mr. Cohen. However, I am still not sure if you have proven yourself worthy of my knowledge.”  “You sweat soaked sonofa…” Sandy became dizzy, still exhausted from the earlier fight. “You are fully aware of my powers Carlos. And I have respected this hell of yours hell, and I have respected your rules. Now I insist that you respect our deal.”  Carlos bellowed, ”BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Mr. Cohen! Are you threatening me? Perhaps you’d like to see a true demonstration of my powers!”  “Bring it.” Sandy wiped a blood soaked sleeve across this forehead and limped back to the arena.

       MAILBAG!   [ opening the closet where the mailbag is kept ]  Holy tons-of-dust! The mailbag is all covered in nastiness. Guess I should check in here more often! What's this?  [ rummaging under the bag ]  Aww, it's The Buckle's Tender Heart Care Bear. He'll be glad I found it. Anyway, let's look in the bag...  ...bills...bills...letter from mom...bills...AH HA! Here's one. Oooh, and it's good!   To:  Buzz Rodell  From:  The Maker's Wife  Date:  March 22, 2004   Dear Buzz,  I've had it with you! Every time you come over to our place to watch a new  O.C.  episode, you leave your empty soda cans all over and those shoes you wear smell bad enough to make our dog sick!  I know my husband would NEVER have the courage to tell you to shape up, but I do! And you better listen mister! No more empty potato chip bags or pizza boxes under my couch! No more taking my husband out late to clubs and parties with Hollywood floozies!  I'm making it my personal mission to clean you up! You got it Buzz? You might think you're a superstar, but not in my house! I'm watching you!  It's for your own good,  - The Maker's Wife    ------------------------------  Dear The Maker's Wife,  First let me apologize for the delay in replying to your letter. Our mailbag was stolen by ninjas-for-hire and then buried in a field somewhere in Montana. It was later dug up by a pack of trained prairie dogs who dragged our beloved mailbag into a small down and it was sent back to us. Don't question the trained prairie dogs.  First allow me to say that there is a tone of concern in your voice, and I'm pretty sure I know what it's about.  You're worried about Seth, and I totally understand because so am I. I couldn't help but wonder why Seth threw everything away. I was very disappointed because Ryan helped Seth become such a great person and showed him how to be strong. And the moment things get a little rough in Newport, Seth sets sail (say that three times fast!).  I don't know what to tell you just yet. I think Seth will be fine. He's a big boy and can handle whatever comes his way...even if it's sharks, storm swells and the Bermuda Triangle.  Sail on Summer Breeze...sail on...  Thanks for reading, - Buzz Rodell  P.S. - If you haven't looked under the couch since you wrote that letter and you value your health...I wouldn't go under there. I'll come over this weekend with a Hazmat suit and tongs to take care of that...

       SEASON TWO, EPISODE ONE: ACCORDING TO BUZZ - PART II   Need to read part one?  urlLink Go here . Otherwise, I give you part two...  Seth walked up to the front door of his business and smiled big. “SETH'S USED CLASSICS” the sign read with a giant picture of himself giving a thumbs up at the end.  Seth had never made it to his intended destination of Tahiti. As a matter of fact, he only made it as far south as San Diego before the Coast Guard picked him up and convinced him not to make his foolish trip.  So now he was trapped in San Diego. He knew there was only one thing he could do to earn some cash. Seth sold his boat to an older man looking to buy his son a nice boat for his birthday. The man was so pleased with the condition of the boat that he paid Seth $10,000, far more than Seth had asked for. Seth immediately used some of the cash to find an apartment and to purchase an almost perfect 1965 red Ford Mustang to cruise the town in.  One night while pulling up to a club, the club owner saw Seth’s car. That evening he offered Seth $12,000 for the car, in cash.  Seth’s Used Classics made its first sale.  Seth hadn’t thought much about everyone back home, he did what he could to not think about them. Ryan, his friend and brother, had left him. All he could think about was getting on that boat and running. He thought about calling his parents, he knew they deserved to know he was okay. But every time he picked up the phone, he couldn’t help but think they just let Ryan go and never tried to stop him.  The bell tied to the front door rang as a customer came in. Seth whispered to himself, “No time for reminiscing, money calls.”  Marissa wasn’t sure how much longer she could live with her mother and Caleb. She had no friends anymore, Julie saw to that. Marissa barely came out of her room during the summer. She’d only wander around the mansion and grounds when her mother and Caleb went on another extravagant vacations to Europe or South America. She liked those times the most, no one telling her what to do. She’d just float in the pool and have the help of the house bring her fresh margs every now and then.  She thought about Ryan everyday and it hurt her. Every time she thought about not saying good-bye, it felt like there was an icy hand squeezing her heart. He called her once, early in the summer, just to check in. She barely remembered it because she had stolen a couple of her mother’s “magic pills” to make the day go by easier. “Whatever,” she’d tell herself. She would just tell herself that if it was meant to be, then he wouldn’t have left.  She e-mailed Summer a few times. Marissa had wished they had been able to get together, but Summer often acted weird whenever she brought up trying to have dinner together. Maybe when school starts again.

       KONVERSATIONS WITH THE KEY   Did you see what I did there? I misspelled "conversations" to be clever. That's how crazy I get!  I picked up the phone this morning and gave a call to my old buddy, The Key. If you recall, I first met The Key while doing "The L.A." extra work. The Key is our publicist for  The O.C. , he's the guy behind the guy who makes sure that our favorite kids show up when and where they're supposed to. He's like a well-dressed Gepetto.  Anyway, I thought I'd give him a call this morning to see what's up and what I could get out of him about the upcoming season. Below is a transcript of the conversation:   THE KEY:  The Key's desk.  BUZZ:  Er, uh, hello Key. I represent the uh...Entertainment Daily Times and I was hoping I could get some info from you about  The O.C.'s  second season.  THE KEY:  Well, not much is known yet. I'm not really sure I can help you.  BUZZ:  Well then, maybe you can tell me where the cast is spending their summer?  THE KEY:  Well, not really. They're all friends but I'm sure they have their own plans.  BUZZ:  Can I ask what Josh Schwartz's office phone number is?  THE KEY:  I'm sorry, I can't give that to you.  BUZZ:  How about Ben McKenzie's cellphone number?  THE KEY:  No, can't do that either.  BUZZ:  Rachel Bilson's home address?  THE KEY:  Wait, Bilson's address? Rodell? Is that you?  BUZZ:  Er...uh...who?  THE KEY:  What's that clicking sound? Are you recording this!?  BUZZ:  [ silence ]  [ click ]

       SEASON TWO, EPISODE ONE: ACCORDING TO BUZZ - PART I   In a world run by me, I'd propose the following story. Now, please let it be known that the following piece would be the most brilliant and mind boggling episode to open a season in the history of television. Including that whole  Dallas  thing.  I give to you,  The O.C. , episode 201 (possibly titled, "The Good, The Bad, and the Cohen")...  Sandy Cohen wiped the dirt from his sweaty and swollen brow as he gathered his strength to stand back up. The massive gentleman built like a tank had other plans for Sandy.  The large man took a beefy fisted swing at Sandy. Sandy instinctively ducked to the left, grabbed the man’s arm and proceeded to apply a kung-fu style grip he had learned while taking a self-defense course at Berkley. Without any effort, Sandy swiftly twisted the man’s gigantic arm, and twisted until he heard the pop of the shoulder leaving the socket and then released.  The ogre-like man howled in pain and nursed the shoulder. Sandy took advantage.  Sandy hopped back two steps, took a deep breath to find his center, then called upon his Charging Dragon training. Sandy’s eyes became a fiery orange and his voice become low and almost demonic. An explosion of mystical orange light surrounded him and the image of Sandy’s towering Chinese dragon roared above him.  “For my son’s honor!” Sandy yelled. He stomped his right leg forward and forced the Dragon spirit from his body and toward the bewildered oaf on the other side of the dirt ring.  The man screamed as the Dragon swirled around him, striking powerful blows with its spirit tail. The Dragon then raced to the roof of the building and exploded with ancient energy before it crashed down on Sandy’s opponent. The force of the crash made a crater in the center of the ring that was ten feet deep. In the bottom, the oaf groaned.  “WINNER!” A small, leather skinned man raised Sandy’s arm. Sandy showed indifference to his victory. The shady crowd in attendance howled and a flurry of money moved about the people.  Summer scanned the television monitors infront of her. The out of focus, black and white images gave her a headache, but this was her job now.  She thought about last summer. She was a different person back then. Snobby and carefree. She always thought she’d get everything she wanted and that her father would always be there to support her. And then she met Seth Cohen. She barely knew who he was the first few times they talked and a year later, she would be madly in love with him.  But that was before everything changed. Sandy and Kirsten called Summer that day, when they found the letters that Seth had written to them. She remembered that Kirsten was exhausted from watching both her boys leave. One of them went to Chino. The other was out there, unreachable. When she first read the letter, she hated Seth. She locked herself in her room for two weeks after that, cursing his name and just trying to forget him. Coop had come over a few times, but she had issues in her own life to work out now.  Summer had jokingly filled out a boot camp training form during those two weeks. She was called a week later by Sergeant Tom Wilkerson. The Serge would push Summer to emotion and physical exhaustion. But he knew what he was doing, Eventually he took Summer out of the boot camp program and took her to practice with the Army’s elite Ranger division.  Summer would laugh to herself when she thought about what “she did on her summer vacation.” She’d pretend to reply to the Newport elite, “Oh, well I learned to field strip an M-60 machine gun, repair a destroyed tank tread, as well as run 60 miles in 100 degree heat carrying a 215lbs. soldier on my back without breaking a sweat. How about you? Palm Springs again?”  Now she’s working as head of security for a secret military arms manufacturer called Rodell Industries. The work they did there was top secret and government funded. Most of it didn’t make sense to her anyway. Her job was just to stop anyone trying to sneak in.  Then the alarm in Sector 1-B went off.  [ To be continued... ]

       GAME FACES PEOPLE!       I am BACK! [ Buzz kicks his desk chair across the office ] Alright kiddies, I'm back from my favorite city, and I'm ready for this hiatus. Yeah, that's right. I said I'm READY!  Before I reveal my game plan, let's talk about  urlLink the picture  that The Baron and The Maker put up. What's up with that hair? Part mullet, part super "fwoop." 8th grade was a bad year for me in the fashion department. I'm just glad that's all they had, and not the one with the sweet Batman shirt.  Ugh. I was brutally uncool folks. But now look at me! HA!  I already started one project I'll tentatively title,  Season Two, Episode One...According to Buzz . I'll be editing and posting the first of that later today.  Then there's the list of to-be-made action figures, probably some more  urlLink Luke In Time  stories laying around here somewhere as well and more  urlLink Side Job's  featuring Agent Gallagher. We'll see if I can't force The Baron and The Maker to write something here and there.  So we're going to be alright. I promise. We've made it through these breaks before. I'll be able to tell you how long this storm is going to last just as soon as J. Schwartz finds time to gimme a call and tell me next seasons start date.  KARATE CHOP YA HIATUS! KABLOOM!

       CHECKING IN   Hey kiddies. I just wanted to check in after the finale to see how you're all holding up. Pretty amazing, eh? I told you that you'd be blown away.  Well, I'm still in Chicago on vacation so this is my only post until I come back. I saw Rachel on MTV's Total Request Live today, too bad she's not stopping in Chitown, I've got an extra ticket to the Cubbies game tomorrow!  Glad to see The Maker and The Baron have kept this place clean. Have they even been in here?  I'll be back soon.

          I just got this in my e-mail:   Buzz,  I'm in Daytona Beach. Your car is fine. I'm sending you a t-shirt of a drunk turtle that says "I'M HAVING A SHELL OF A TIME!"  That's hilarious.  - Brad   You can't run forever Brad.

      So I sent Brad out about a week ago to get me a fruit smoothy and to wash my car. He's yet to return with my smoothy...and my car.  This drought is taking it's toll on the Buzzer. I've watched the old episodes a few times, checked around some of the other fan sites, and even read this site about a thousand times. There's just...nothing.  I should go bug The Key for any little bit of information, but he's a busy guy. I should go bug The Baron to do some snazzy site update, but he's busy too.  The Buckle and I are discussing a few projects that we hope to get off the ground before season two starts, but you know how I am with promising things...so I'm not gonna.  All I can really say is hold tight. Don't you know things can change, things'll go your way, if you hold on for one more day. Can you hold on for one more day? Things'll go your way...hold on for one more day...

      The Los Angeles Times reports today that county supervisors in the "real" Orange County are considering renaming John Wayne Airport to  The O.C.  and grabbing a little bit of the television show's sparkle.  Author Patrick Kiger (co-author of "Poplorica") stated, "It's the home of Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, and they've got a hockey team named after a fictional hockey team in a movie. In a way, maybe this is consistent — the idea that you take something that's fictional and model real life after it."  Our buddy J. Schwartz commented on the possible renaming.  "It was always our goal to rename the county, and the airport seems like a perfectly good place to start."  Sounds good to me. How great would it be to hear, "Welcome to the O.C., bitch. Flight 160 is now departing," over the terminal's PA system. There could even be the  Buzz Rodell Cafeteria  where a slightly pudgy and scruffy looking guy sits, makes sarcastic comments and kisses your ass like you're a celebrity from the show. And that's saying he even shows up at all.  Jerk.

      So Buzz calls somewhere around 10am yesterday and tells me to cover for him and if the boss asked that he was "having car trouble." Of course, when the boss did finally ask, I just said, "It sounded like he was calling from the beach!"  Anyway, he wanted to me to post but he didn't have a clue as to what he wanted me to post. He said, "I dunno, make something up."  So first I thought maybe I'll get The Buckle to write up something on himself, like  urlLink The Baron  did. So I e-mail The Buckle, ask him to do it, and this is what I get back:   Brad,  Shut up kid! I'll wrestle you!  Sincerely,  The Buckle   As you can see, that wasn't much help. So I turned to digging through the internet and  O.C.  fansites to see if there's any news out there.  urlLink Zap2it  reported that Alan Dale, better known as Caleb Nichol, has officially become a "regular." This means we can expect to see plenty more of Caleb getting in the middle of the Cohen's life.  There's plenty of gossip going around out there, but I don't print anything that isn't fact.  Buzz called. He's on his way in. I better be getting some AWESOME school credit for this internship...

      So hello everybody. My name is Brad the Summer Intern. So far, working for Buzz has been SO cool. He's shown me his collection of  O.C.  paraphernalia (which is an almost ridiculous amount of stuff for one person) and he's introduced me to the infamous Baron and Buckle. The Buckle challenged me to a "have a wrestle" but Buzz stepped in and told him not just yet.  Buzz even gave me an autographed VHS copy of "The L.A." featuring himself...  [ sound of door closing ]  Okay, Buzz is gone. He was looking over my shoulder while I was writing the stuff above.  What is up with this guy? I think he's a little "off" if you know what I mean. He keeps telling me to wait outside The Key's office and ask him all kinds of stupid questions. And you should see his desk! I didn't think it was possible for anyone to have THAT many pictures of them self! And every time I say "summer intern" he gets this crazy look because of whatever sick obsession he has with the Summer character.  Seriously...if you don't hear from me on Monday...call my parents and send help!  [ door opens ]  I can't wait to work closer with Buzz and his brilliance. We're heading out now for some delicious breakfast. I hope he's not mad that I'm an omelette fan! I have to go get Mr. Rodell's car now...    ...please...help...

       MEET BRAD   So Monday I mentioned that I thought I needed an assistant in order to keep things running smoothly around here and to post stuff more often. And in casual conversation later that day, I jokingly mentioned to the boss that "Wow, I could really use a summer intern."  Next thing I know, I'm reading applications and letters from people wanting to be part of the Pool House experience. I've spent the last two days reading resumes, making phone calls and narrowing down a field of about 100 applicants from prestigious colleges all over the United States.  Late last night, I finished the pile. The last resume was from a young upstart like myself. This was the letter that he wrote:   Dear Mr. Rodell,  For several months I have been checking in on your Pool House and each day reading with enough envy to drown my soul. I would check three times a day just to see what small morsel of O.C. information or humor you were going to throw out to us gentle Plebeians.  I would read every day knowing in my heart that I would risk my flesh and blood to be part of such a machine. To be just a little involved in the greatness that you have created and the greatness of The O.C.  I write to you today in hopes that you'll hear my plea. This letter serves not only as an application, but a swearing to you that I will go to the edge of this existence in order to help you better yourself.  All I'm asking for is a chance, Mr. Rodell.  Sincerely,  Brad [the Summer Intern]   This morning I called Brad. Told him he got the job. He dropped the phone and screamed to his parents for about 15 minutes. When he returned, I told him that he starts Monday and he needs to get my dry cleaning on the way in. Brad will probably be doing most of the posting on here for the next few weeks, so be nice to him...because I've got plenty of free time now and I know where you live...  Welcome to showbiz, Brad.

That's awesome! I should be back in Los Angeles next week, do you think you can get me on the set? Do you think I can bring some friends? What about cameras? Can we bring cameras?

      I'm hammering away in here, trying to spruce this place up before season two gets here. And The Baron is off running around Europe, so I'm here by my lonesome trying to do this (I'm not quite as good as ol' Baron with this stuff). But isn't that banner freakin' SCHWEET?  Plus there's more rumors that some big stuff is coming about, but there's always rumors, right?  Okay...so where'd I put my screwdriver...ah, here it is. Right under my copy of the REAL season two, episode one script...  ...I'm such a jerk.

      So in all the madness of turning an ancient 26 years-old on Thursday, I decided to honor myself with a little Buzz Rodell Action Figure.    1 - Official  urlLink  O.C.  t-shirt  from FOX 1 - Pair of old blue jeans WITH the red Pumas! 1 - Cell phone for checking in on The Baron 1 - Bottle of delicious syrup for all my waffling needs 1 - The Red Phone that connects DIRECTLY to Josh Scwartz 1 - Picture of a special lady  And don't forget...  1 - Jar of Buzz's dreams...and if you'll notice, it's VERY full!  I should have included a surf board so the Buzz figure could shred some killer waves with the  urlLink PFG figure . I guess I can just cut out another copy of PFG's board.  I just ask that when you cut me out that you don't be too rough. My old bones can't really take all the action they used to.

      Have I read the first three scripts? True. Did I see episode 201, "The Distance?" True. Is Ben McKenize my best friend?  urlLink Not really  true. Am I a very lucky boy? True.  Am I going to give you some hints today? Very true.  Last Thursday, the video tape stork flew by dropped the first episode of the new season on The Baron's desk. Before he could even say, "I have episode 201," I was standing over him salavating and ready to swipe the tape. The fear in The Baron's eyes was clear as he slowly handed me the tape.  That night, I went home and watched it and even  urlLink abused my power  a little.  So here we are, some  93  days (if my math is right) away from seeing our friends back on national television and I was able to see the first episode. Now before you riot in jealousy, I plan on sharing some things with you.  As always, I will share things in the most cryptic way possible to keep you guessing and to keep my butt covered and out of trouble for possibly revealing too much.  Are you ready? Huh? Are ya? LET'S DANCE!   Peeled oranges wasn't the sign he was looking for. A beard, a tan and a yacht are the equation of success. You can't forget about the water polo team. Summer cleans up to resonate at a higher frequency. Marissa does a little remodeling of her own. Big lies can't last long before they explode even bigger. Summer was gone before summer really started. A two pronged attack leads to a sweet victory. 1622 kilometers.
