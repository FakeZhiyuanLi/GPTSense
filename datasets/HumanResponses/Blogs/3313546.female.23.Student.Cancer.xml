						      Ivan the horrible and the knights of malta carried their crests like certain birds display their feathers, in likelihood much brighter than the light of day, polished swords would gleam than the rain scatter of needle pricks of light dancing mercurially off the  surface of a river- ancient waters that like a muslin curtain like a heavy purple death shroud over dusty moth eaten bones, the delicate filigree of age, decay- webs of spun filaments- waving roling in the currents like certain sea plants while the contoured bodies, the barks sunken the ladies and gentlemen unfortunate- lose color, form and contour- to the flowing current, water, a viscous medium of flux, casts away and back the image of the world above, a doe pausing shyly and timid by a shady pool, laps daintily and receives her own beauty, the mirror condescends never bends, and here, we, rain- at heart look into waters, as through a magic talisman, to discern- the artifice a clone, in the witness we reveal ourselves to ourselves, to know oneself is to know one's effect as well as one's defect, one's echo and visaud as well as the labor,  that one has prepared for oneself, an  existential purpose driven like a knife to death, a linear path to dissuade one from living in more than two dimensions as the literate whore serves a paperwork God- bows low under the shadow of Count Tolstoy or Shehazerade tales are told merely ladder rungs on a Jacob's ladder past habituates in us, sending out tendrils wherever civil man endures- and man descends, while the waters condescend, all the while remaining impenetrable polluted, but transparent as if all the evil man creates were seen for a moment, in true -revelation we could only be what we are, no  matter if the heaven's call, the waters bear out and we despair, in the shallows, cowards.

						   wilted daisies, nimble fingered doves of light, filtered through the filigree of kindred souls, yellow edged draperies, crisp sheets of blotting paper, like a novice in a seminary, learning from the elementary a complicit engagement with flesh, and blood, a vapor, an illicit centerfold, opening out like a stage curtain separating, parting like the red sea, in the marvelous times of tribulation, native essence- the blessed flesh opens and encapsulates discovery, which is the prickly thorns the latex glove,  an eminent horizon opened, “who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” A nimble finger pressed on the jugular vein, a nuance of embrace in the thrifty symbolism of sign language, the spirit intime`  capsules of love in the sparse decorum, in the self that cast without, captures in the eye of another, the lyric of flowering deliverance, however called, and however lain the slipstones underfoot are a foundation of monuments, in the silver singing creek the slick stones carrol with the waters, whispering undertones of infinite unfolding realities,   “you used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived and now mountains come between us space delimited becomes a cross-section, a plane, a box, a void evanescent for the militant brain,  “Put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature” the angels touched me, felt tipped wings caressed me in my iniquity, pitted wounds, potted plants, copper vessels, and inkstands,  emerging from the earth, I bent my soul and wept,  I called to those I lost to death, and anchored them with my living breath,  a song broken free enveloped everything with filigree, half-baked loaves, and jettisoned cargo  unto us, joy and love, angels carved miniature saints in the woodwork calisthenics did the rest,  covenant of the sanctified, the rising sun with cloven hooves earth works, are we mulch and mildewed graft  greed and linseed oil, calligraphic idolators.

						   The rim of the canyon, leaning out over the chasm believing, in the moment, that the event emerges from the clouds of silence, as a luminous word, a spoken fragment, calling out, timid at first, of happiness, casting away from earth, casting off from a perch atop a boulder, into the abyss that represents freedom jutting stones form the solid foundation for footsteps, counted, carefully, as the measured distance between life and death, as precise, as years, or seconds, or miliseconds of time, distance and light, make a crafted picture, or a watercolor, a  still pontifical photograph, dark, brooding black and white, revelations that touch not on what belongs to us of the past,   memories only heighten the loss silence cascades into infinity as the individual, wears away, by chemical erosion, and becomes again, and again something, a miracle, a pod, a limerick, hiding secrets, but displaying matter-  in its’ most vulgar depravity, of decay  a mammoth tusk, smooth and like a moon in its remote wonder, unlike the flesh of a living beast, cold  a perch, atop a boulder, over a gorge,  what lies below can be gleamed in detail, through a periscope  reflected, enlarged, changed but what reality, there is in a tree, a creek, a herd of cattle grazing, cannot be reached  unless one falls, or attempts a reincarnation as a bird.

      Well, I have been there done that a few times, but I am aware how rare a real understanding person is. But these superficial judgements on behavior, and on appearance hide a certain problem, for the individual, which is that the individual lives from inside, not outside. And in the search for company, people are apt to comply with other people, mimic, imitate, or use artifice to convince another person or group of people, to believe they are genteel, and well meaning, that they attract by subterfuge is the morally ambiguous part.   Now and then I start to realize how self- centered my ambitions are, but self-centered doesn't necessarily mean that they come from a genuine motive. Ambitions seem to be from the outside, the perception of what we need to accomplish in order to deserve love, money, and respect. :  I am in a zone now, but I am remembering what it was like to spend money not for enjoyment of spending, but for enjoyment itself. I don't think I have captured an image of what I am like inside, but my writing especially in a grazzy shady place beneath a well leaved tree, a graceful and perfectly shaped tree, at that. I am pleased, an exact place, and I just relax. Then I am aware of how tense I become around other people, when I start to become suspicious of them, and I am not interested in being looked at or judged.   Exoskeletons, and all that, I enjoy reading when I am alone, not when people bother me, or insist on attracting attention, but I see the enjoyment of other people as a genuine benefit of being in public, I really enjoyed it, but to relax, I need space, grass, and comfort.  I found a good poetry contest, I will pursue it, for a moment. I may make some contacts, that way. I am a poet without a direction, what shall I do to attract more attention?

      Hi, I quit my job two Fridays ago, I got hired today at the CU Bookstore, run by Barnes & Noble, as a cashier, for the temp/seasonal positions, full time, and if I get the time I will be very excited to enjoy my 20% discount on textbooks, which is a reason to celebrate indeed. I am very proud. I just went to the Hill on Monday, looked around, picked up applications at Alexander's, and for the Temp positions at the CU Bookstore, but I am really glad I took Tuesday to pamper and enjoy myself, and I insisted that Grandpa buy better groceries, so that my appetite will be more active. I.e. I am tired of feeling down because I am not happy with the food I eat. People are like animals in that, the quality and flavor of food improves the eating, and contributes to healthier habits.   Full time is cool.  It is July 28, now. I am kind of surprised how quickly I found a job. Maybe a good sign?  I am still carrying applications for two other jobs, Dairy Queen on the Hill, and Salvaggio's deli.  Tamara needs to get up here to find a job soon. I think.  Right now I am radical. I am feeling less Republican, even as the election grows near.   Right now, I am reading a book by Margaret Atwood, named "The Blind Assasin", she is a very Canadian writer, and I like that. I also started reading The Unvanquished lastnight at Trident, it is enrapturing. As before when I was reading Wild Palms and Go Down Moses, Faulkner manages to innovate everything, characters, language, etc...  I have very good news, to bear, that I am writing well, again. Not bad. What I need is a good beer, perhaps a celebration?  I am happy also, because, my library card at CU, works... Time to find more reading materials.   Adios, Su Amiga, Alisia

      as corny as it seems like, i write poetry because it fills some time in my evening, after i read my new book, and read the new york times, drank my tea, at trident at 10;40 or so I decided to get out my new blue notebook to write, it is a very neat compact and paginated notebook, in which to continuously develop a poem. i may sleep tonight if it isn't too hot, it is the time in the summer when it is almost impossible to sleep at night, because of the heat. i drink water, but it seems like i can't feel as tired as i would because of the caffeine, and the heat. also i am exhilherated because i wrote a poem and submitted it to a contest online, hoping it will elicit some response or to wit, give me some real critical feedback, because i am not just any poet, anyway, i didn't read poetry at penny lane tonight, i decided to write poetry not read it into a mike, more class, and honest work, i am reading shelley again, i woke up at sunrise on sunday morning i think, and read poetry while the sun came up, sweet rewards, all i wanted to read was milton, but unfortunately in my weeding process, i got rid of a few books i wanted. alas, what a loss. wit is important to me, and it is also important to give up on trying to completely shock or inspire anyone, even though writing is the most creative activity i am engaged in on a daily basis, all the words i write are meant for someone to read, that is a surprise to me, but the only reason i would write poetry would be for personal benefit, to read it to someone, or print it so women and men can read it. cool runnings.   well sayonara. alisia barringer

      I am enjoying my night, listening to "cool jazz" on the radio. I read a book for a while at Trident, today I finished Iceland's Bell, by Haldor Laxness, read a part of The Unconsoled by Ishiguro, the English writer, not Japanese, who wrote The Remains of the Day. I am still trying to finish this book. I started a Faulkner book, GO Down Moses, but I am not officially reading it, except that I am already deeply involved in it. I started a new book, to replace Iceland's Bell, called "The Cold Heaven, Seven Seasons in Greenland" by Gretel Erlich, an author I was introduced in a literature class I took this spring semester at CU, Multicultural Literature, the teacher McVey, who I have had before was teaching a class on "Literature of the West", Erlich apparently is both an expert on Greenland, an experienced documentary filmmaker, and a talented writer about Montana.   "Unforgettable" is on the radio right now, "That's why darling its' incredible, that someone so unforgettable, thinks that I am unforgettable too..." fade away.  I am trying to redeem my notebooks from my experimental "Beer Sessions", writing while under the influence. Although, realistically, any influence can be powerful, not just innebriation.   The guy who works at Trident who is in the military is going to Iraq possibly in September, he seems excited about it. Odd.    I walked around for a while after leaving Trident, at 10:00 pm. Found nothing exciting, except while waiting for the SKIP, an openly gay middle aged couple at Styr Martini Bar and Dance Club, decidedly a sleazy place, next to the Soma before it. But in the same location, who cares. This man had very thick hair, and glasses, the bouncer and another big guy had to fight with him to get him to leave, push him outside, then his friend joined him, at first I thought it was a a woman and a man, then noticing that the man that had been fighting had a beard I identified him as a man, because his hairstyle, and appearance were ambiguous somewhat. There are some very ugly women out there, no doubt. But his friend and he, were an odd pair, I watched them, because the one man who had been bounced kept trying to convince the doorman to let him back inside, his friend went back inside once or twice, but when his friend tried to go in, he was checked and rebuffed by the doorman. I am oddly puzzled. Because apparently being in Boulder, and a liberal society at that, it wasn't a problem that they were gay, acceptance is in, here, but this man kept causing trouble. Eye raising.   I guess. Like any other couple, when one individual is drunk and causing embarassment, fighting with the bouncer, yelling, acting badly, I don't think political sensibilities always take into account that men and women, whatever their gender or sexual orientation, are just as likely to act badly in any situation, especially when they are drunk, what difference does it make what orientation they are.  I'll see what I can do tomorrow to make my day better. I don't want to drink, now that I am familiar with the choices available on Pearl St. Honestly I think they aren't that nice, I wouldn't want to drink beer or anything else at these places. I've tried. I am not into dance clubs, sleazy singles, smelly college places, sports bars, oyster and seafood restaurants, pool halls, or breweries.

      Grandpa said a very strange thing about soft soap, this morning, Soft soap makes every thing smoother. I guess it does. We went downtown together on the Skip, before we parted, going our separate ways, stopping for a brief drink together at Starbucks. I cashed my paycheck and bought a hot dog. I went shopping and came home, for the rest of the day, I read for a while, my book Iceland's Bell, and came home.  I am going to a film tonight. Accidently I think. And I am trying out a retro skirt/blouse from the 70s, seeing how it works. The polyester doesn't breathe very well. Oh my.  I think I am not important, but I want to regress a little, so I am looking like a different person in a way. I am not at all put out at the concerns at Trident, but it mildews over to a point, I am often tempted by it, when I am not in the mood to drink tea at home. But there are so few students there that I am totally out of the element that I am seeking. I can't enjoy a cafe full of middle aged parents, divorcees, and teachers. I don't like it.  I am young. At least, but life moves on whether I do or not.  I just wanted to be original, not copy everyone, and I am not sure anymore what is or isn't like the trend, I just don't know enough about other people, if I did I might know what is reasonable to expect, what is reasonable to look for, and what is good enough to settle for in the way of romance. How good is good?  Goodbye.  Alisia

      A new word perhaps? Well, hello another hot dry sunny day in Boulder. No thinking required. Boring, dull, admittedly limited geographics, limited venues, cheap consumers and cheap products, chain restaurants, upscale dining, law abiding bars and clubs that play 80s classics, (safe, stale politics, nothing too challenging for the tourists). Some local music. On the Hill, sunny and shady alternating, the heat rises from pavement, there are few points to consider: 1. Location, on the Hill, 2. Season, summer so it is empty as a small town, 3. old slimy or grungy hippies, homeless people, and flower children, as well as barefoot guitar strumming singers, and crazy redneck 40 something divorcees. Uber conservatives, neoconservatives in democratic disguise, ambition creates yuppies. Everything divorced of ideas, alienated from my life, I am walking through a city that dislikes intellect, shuns the real practice of it, writing, and reading, an∂ høpefully talking, we can only imagine what it was like for poets and writers in the 1960s, but now, this place stinks of sell outs. Often, almost everyday I walk through this same low down quiet neighborhood, surrounded by centenarian trees, Victorian remodels, rebuit monstrosities, and cute English manor style homes, along Mapleton, etc... until I reach Pearl St, where the cute quiet neighborhood gives off onto cute little shops, a cute bakery, a cute wine shop, a cute Grocery, a cute pizzeria, a cute paper factory and stationary shop, two antique shops; one expensive the other quaint,  an Indian restaurant, the headquarters for Sky Chairs, a White Apartment house, right next to the new age medicinal and skin product store, then across the street the bike shop, we proceed downtown, past the boring center of town. Nothing is more likely to create confusion and disillusionment than seeing the same people, the same faces, the same "cute" town everday, and no part of Boulder is more unbearable than the Pearl St. Mall, don't be fooled. If I was satisfied with irony, I would stop here. ..  I have given in to my lifestyle, which is also cute. Enough cute already, it makes me nervous, and sick.   I live with my grandpa in a cute little white house, with a cute little black dog, with cute little sayings and proverbs, moderately humorous, very humble on white placards, etc...  I carry blueberries, strawberries, and 1 navel orange in my backpack. When I describe it it feels less horrifying, but really I didn't like being put into this law abiding community. I need a community more wild, less restricted, with a feeling a sophisticated and difficult intelligence, and not this easy freethinking, open forum, a little more conflict makes life interesting.  Don't you agree?

      You'd better watch what you say about Billy Collins, I tell myself, in my mind I imagine myself a hit target of the mafia, marked for elimination. But, Billy Collins, the author of six collections of poetry, distinguished professor at Lehman College in the City University of New York, recently served as the Poet Laureate of the United States- even though his literary contributions in my opinion deserve questions. What is the fate of poetry in this sexually enhanced, breast implanted Martian landscape, TV raised generation of Americans, except dissolution into a watery abyss of nothingness.   I was walking through the halls of the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I am a student when I came across a seemingly innocent flyer for a Poetry Book Award Contest, judged by Billy Collins. I who am reasonably well versed (well versed, hah hah) in poets and poetry; I write poetry myself, have read it in poetry readings, and am familiar with most of the major writers, if not a devoted reader of Walt Whitman, Pablo Neruda, Marianne Moore, T.S. Elliot, e.e. cummings, Gertrude Stein, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Blake, Dryden, Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Rilke, Ogden Nash, Emily Dickenson, Sylvia Plath, Ann Sexton, Shelley, Yeats, Keats, etc...   I am familiar enough and flexible enough, and well read, enough to I think feel out a new style or idea. But, Billy Collins, alas, is another "stupid American", who brings his cultural literacy and illiteracy equally into his writing, in order to expose his own shallowness, the shallow nature of his writing and its' pointlessness- absurd personal anecdotal prose. Ah. But one must whet one's whistle:  Here are a few Billy Collins Masterpieces! And this man was chosen as Poet Laureate, some Presidents need to get out more and enjoy libraries.  ::::::::::::. 1. Study in Orange and White    I knew that James Whistler was part of the Paris scene,  but I was still surprised when I found the painting  of his mother at the Musée d'Orsay  among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes  of the French Impressionists.  And I was surprised to notice  after a few minutes of benign staring,  how that woman, stark in profile  and fixed forever in her chair,  began to resemble my own ancient mother  who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth.  You can understand why he titled the painting  "Arrangement in Gray and Black"  instead of what everyone naturally calls it,  but afterward, as I walked along the river bank,  I imagined how it might have broken  the woman's heart to be demoted from mother  to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness.  As the summer couples leaned into each other  along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats  full of spectators slid up and down the Seine  between the carved stone bridges  and their watery reflections,  I thought: how ridiculous, how off-base.  It would be like Botticelli calling "The Birth of Venus"  "Composition in Blue, Ochre, Green, and Pink,"  or the other way around  like Rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color  "Fishing Boats Leaving Falmouth Harbor at Dawn."  Or, as I scanned the menu at the cafe  where I now had come to rest,  it would be like painting something laughable,  like a chef turning on a spit  over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks  and calling it "Study in Orange and White."  But by that time, a waiter had appeared  with my glass of Pernod and a clear pitcher of water,  and I sat there thinking of nothing  but the women and men passing by--  mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs--  and about myself,  a kind of composition in blue and khaki,  and, now that I had poured  some water into the glass, milky-green.     2. Reading an Anthology of Chinese Poems of the Sung Dynasty, I Pause To Admire the Length and Clarity of Their Titles    It seems these poets have nothing  up their ample sleeves  they turn over so many cards so early,  telling us before the first line  whether it is wet or dry,  night or day, the season the man is standing in,  even how much he has had to drink.  Maybe it is autumn and he is looking at a sparrow.  Maybe it is snowing on a town with a beautiful name.  "Viewing Peonies at the Temple of Good Fortune  on a Cloudy Afternoon" is one of Sun Tung Po's.  "Dipping Water from the River and Simmering Tea"  is another one, or just  "On a Boat, Awake at Night."  And Lu Yu takes the simple rice cake with  "In a Boat on a Summer Evening  I Heard the Cry of a Waterbird.  It Was Very Sad and Seemed To Be Saying  My Woman Is Cruel--Moved, I Wrote This Poem."  There is no iron turnstile to push against here  as with headings like "Vortex on a String,"  "The Horn of Neurosis," or whatever.  No confusingly inscribed welcome mat to puzzle over.  Instead, "I Walk Out on a Summer Morning  to the Sound of Birds and a Waterfall"  is a beaded curtain brushing over my shoulders.  And "Ten Days of Spring Rain Have Kept Me Indoors"  is a servant who shows me into the room  where a poet with a thin beard  is sitting on a mat with a jug of wine  whispering something about clouds and cold wind,  about sickness and the loss of friends.  How easy he has made it for me to enter here,  to sit down in a corner,  cross my legs like his, and liste   3.   Pinup  The murkiness of the local garage is not so dense that you cannot make out the calendar of pinup drawings on the wall above a bench of tools. Your ears are ringing with the sound of the mechanic hammering on your exhaust pipe, and as you look closer you notice that this month's is not the one pushing the lawn mower, wearing  a straw hat and very short blue shorts, her shirt tied in a knot just below her breasts. Nor is it the one in the admiral's cap, bending forward, resting her hands on a wharf piling, glancing over the tiny anchors on her shoulders. No, this is March, the month of great winds, so appropriately it is the one walking her dog along a city sidewalk on a very blustery day. One hand is busy keeping her hat down on her head and the other is grasping the little dog's leash, so of course there is no hand left to push down her dress which is billowing up around her waist exposing her long stockinged legs and yes the secret apparatus of her garter belt. Needless to say,  in the confusion of wind and excited dog the leash has wrapped itself around her ankles several times giving her a rather bridled and helpless appearance which is added to by the impossibly high heels she is teetering on. You would like to come to her rescue, gather up the little dog in your arms, untangle the leash, lead her to safety, and receive her bottomless gratitude, but the mechanic is calling you over to look at something under your car. It seems that he has run into a problem and the job is going to cost more than he had said and take  much longer than he had thought. Well, it can't be helped, you hear yourself say as you return to your place by the workbench, knowing that as soon as the hammering resumes you will slowly lift the bottom of the calendar just enough to reveal a glimpse of what  the future holds in store: ah,  the red polka dot umbrella of April and her upturned palm extended coyly into the rain.   4.   Another reason why I don't keep a gun in the house   The neighbors' dog will not stop barking. He is barking the same high, rhythmic bark that he barks every time they leave the house. They must switch him on on their way out.  The neighbors' dog will not stop barking. I close all the windows in the house and put on a Beethoven symphony full blast but I can still hear him muffled under the music, barking, barking, barking,  and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra, his head raised confidently as if Beethoven had included a part for barking dog.  When the record finally ends he is still barking, sitting there in the oboe section barking, his eyes fixed on the conductor who is entreating him with his baton  while the other musicians listen in respectful silence to the famous barking dog solo, that endless coda that first established Beethoven as an innovative genius.  :::::::::::::::::::::::::.  Maybe I am not appreciating the humor or irony, but I find that this diminished role of poetry, as mere humor, a place to brag about one's idiocy. I see a few things in Billy Collins, first that he is an opportunist taking advantage of the changes in the literary scene since the Beat movement brought us Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, the poets of the Civil Right' era, and Sylvia Plath, all who stretched the cultural boundaries of poetry as well as innovating in style and language, yet still maintaing a purpose, a underlining beauty of the idea, or of a turn of phrase, that emphasis that makes poetry important to read, a pursuit of beauty, truth, wonder or understanding, as well as breaking ground on a literary plot.   Billy Collins, Poet Laureate? Really. Not exactly a Robert Frost or a Maya Angelou, a literate hoax, a presumption on an audience, and he gets paid for this?  Well, there are plenty of fools in the world we live in, no list of credentials and credits can possibly replace the value of meaningful writing. Eh.  Everyone needs to eat- one shenanigan fools another.   I see a few intelligent themes in his poems, but nothing like Poetry. 1. Tourism: the position of an American traveling in other cultures, or countries, with a limited education 2. Titles: the charm of titles 3. Looking at a work of art, as an American, and finally 4. Everyday thinking when faced with extraordinary or pretentious subject matter.  Thanks.  Alisia Barringer
