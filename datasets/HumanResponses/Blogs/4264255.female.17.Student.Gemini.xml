      well today was monday, oh gosh i sure am tired.  i didn't get much sleep this weekend although i am sure i will this coming weekend considering the fact that i am grounded... my parents said i couldn't go out sat. night and there was no way i could stand for that in justice so i left and told them i was going to the store.  then i went to tims house where he was haveing a party, i was hoping brian would be there because last time we hung out he was really cool and we talked for a long time.  but he wasnt so after being there for a while i went over to alicias house where everyone was hanging out and eric was being a real shit head.  oh yea on fri we went and saw the exorcist and eric was being dumb about that too. oh well who cares.  yea so anyway everything was worth going out for. well i am tired i am going to get to bed.

      Well i just finished my econ homework, gee i forgot what it was like to finish homework and how good it feels! well today went pretty well i think, i saw senora silva which was way awesome because i love her! and i made acapella so now i can sing my little heart out everyday and now i have my foot in the door for the europe trip! i need to figure out when spanish club starts because i am totally going to do it this year! today i got to see tommy and update him on everything going on, hes so goofy him and steve both. honestly i love the people i work with except for the dumb ones! but i feel bad because even though jim (one of the checkers) smells bad he is really nice. but larry is just down right annoying! i love checking though so much better then courtesy, and i can't belive that guy totally flirted with tiffany. okay to much work talk now, i am starting to sound like an even bigger loser then i am.

      Well today eric and i decided to just be friends... whatever that means, well i do want to be friends but gosh i still do like him, a lot.  Argh why does this always happen to me whenever i have something good i always mess it up some how, i would just be so mean sometimes (like start stupid arguments for no reason) just because i didnt want to get hurt. i dont know i dont really feel like discussing it, now i have to be happy that we are such good friends and focus on our friendship like caitlin said.  i think things will work themself out, besides serious relationships are hard in highschool especially senior year when your leaving soon.  right now i am watching mtv on mute so i can concentrate on doing this, but i do want to download some songs by lyfe who i just heard right now, he sounds a bit like maxwell.  uhhh i have the first day of school tomorrow which is poopy.  i have to wake up early and take my two younger sisters and then i am picking up mine and erics schedules and then taking him his because neither one of us have a first period and then hopefully we can either get some sleep or eat.  i am kinda excited to start school though because everyone secretly is, just this recent news isn't exactly going to make it as good.  mmmm i am eating some round table pizza right now.  okay well i am going to go and organize a binder for school tomorrow.
