      So "Inspiration" hooked me into writing a diary of my own.  I've recently started to read people's lives through their online journalling and have spent ... *ahem* ... not hours of course, because I'm so productive and would never waste my time on frivolous activities, but more like...SMALL snippets of my day spent reading their adventures.   My first entry was copy and pasted from a new found diary I discovered late last night.  (Thanks Ernie!)  I was literally laughing out loud, it was so funny!  =D (although it might have been because of the wee hour in the night - my brain (if you can call it that) shuts down after 1am and it was...after 1am when I was reading it...let's just say that).   I thought I would take this site to write about funny/traumatic/crazy events that occur in my so-called life, but also, to record things I might never be able to voice out loud to the people who actually know me.  Life is weird that way...  So CHEERS to a beginning that hopefully will progress into something worth reading.

      why i hate my name. again.  (The scene:  urlLink Chaat Cafe , last night. I'm at the counter with my boyfriend, ordering dinner. This time, instead of italics being in Chinese like in previous posts, italics signify a heavy, heavy Indian accent.)  Ernie: Hi, one chicken pesto stuffed naan and a chicken tikka dinner please, to go.Woman at the counter: Okay. What's your name?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: What?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: Ornie?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: ORRNIE? [flashes Ernie a dirty look]Ernie: ... yes.Woman: Hrm. [writes my name down, hands it to chef]  After paying with my credit card, I open up my wallet and look for some cash to put in the tip jar. Since I only have bills above $10, I decide I'm not that generous and put my wallet back in my pants, only for the woman cashier to notice and give yet another glare of death. "I think she hates me," I say to Mike.  So, I'm sitting in one of the benches marked for to-go customers, taking in the ambiance; there are framed pictures of Bollywood stars, and the restaurant is still filled with mostly Indian patrons, a promising sign of knowing whether the restaurant is going to be good or not. (As opposed to a restaurant that has a name like, say, "Rick and Mollys House of Sushi." Right?) Although I find it funny that the Indian chef calls out for the name "Horny" for a to-go order.  What kind of Indian name is Horny?  The chef repeats the name again. "HORNY?" on the giant microphone. Except this time he is looking straight at me.  Now at this point, I'm not necessarily thinking he's trying to say the word "horny" - I'm thinking the cashier wrote the name "Ornie" and he's just pronouncing the name a little differently because he's not from America and it's like the game Telephone, when you sit around a circle with your 12-year old friends and you giggle as the phrase "The love of Jesus surrounds me" turns into "blah blah blah (fill it in yourself - as far away a possibility as what it WAS)," so I'm telling myself that it's cool, no harm, no foul.  And only THEN do I look down on the receipt. And there under the order, written in large letter with a giant BIC pen, do I see my name spelled the following way:  H-O-R-N-E-Y.  I look over to the cashier in horror. She's helping another customer, oblivious.

      So it's end of season and I've been looking for 3 pairs of shoes for the last 4 months.  For the boys out there, I'll understand if you don't want to read on.  This is really a girly entry, but successful nonetheless!  =)  So...I don't know if I'm picky or WHAT, but for the whole summer, I couldn't find a simple, 3 pairs of shoes that I (desperately) needed.  Yes, I'm aware that I sound borderline shopaholic and obsessive, and I'm not normally like this (!), but honestly...  Anyway, the pairs of shoes I wanted: 1) black, leather high heeled sandals that are comfortable (minimal straps and bling) 2) beige/white leather lower heeled sandals  "      "          "                              " 3) black, leather, low heeled sanals for daily walking which are ... yes...you got it -  comfortable with minimal straps and bling  End of April: happily traisping along in the malls with C, on the lookout for those things.  End of July: angrily stomping about with a disgusted expression on my face.  I still hadn't found anything I could pass off buying.  One dressy leather pair of sandals I found in early April was $205.   A littttle  over my current budget.  *sigh*  Today was the greatest day though.  I got 2/3!  Recently, shoe stores have been on a massive discount trying to get their summer stock out.  Let me say this first:  I have barely been able to find shoes that I like in my size regularly priced.  If I do, I buy them immediately and feel very lucky to have found them.  Hence, it is needless to say: I have NEVER been able to find shoes that I like ON SALE in my size.   I'm a size 6, and you would THINK that because most girls are that size, they would want to maybe...oh, I don't know...order more than ONE PAIR of size 6 / style.  Nope.  As if.  It's like...the less they have, the better the company feels...almost as if they are trying to keep their shoes RARE or something.  Like the lesser they make of each style, the more each shoe is valued...!  Insane.  Anyway, onward we go with my story.   I was really feeling the frustration of not being able to find a single pair of shoes for the whole summer.  I do buy very expensive leather shoes, but my reasoning is this: they last me for my freaking life time!  (The current sandals I'm wearing are still EXTREMELY good condition and very very comfortable.  Bought 8 years ago!  Italian leather rocks guys).  Yes...so in my mind, I'm justified for spending ~$100-$150 / pair of shoes.   So today: I'm enviously looking at all those great deals and awesome shoes that I can't fit into (because they're so freaking big).  I suddenly see MY $205 shoe (remember, back in April) ON SALE for $150....AND with 25% offffff!  Unbelievable!   I tried them on...and trembling with excitement, found they fit me perfectly.  Like Cinderella!  I brought them to the nearest cashier without further ado.  Upon closer examination, I found that the shoe's sole was a bit tattered (needed gluing) and I asked if they could fix it up!  Well, not only could they fix it up, but they didn't charge me tax!  *dreamy expression*  Can you believe it?!  I was SO in 7th Heaven.   The heavenliness doesn't stop there guys.   Two stores down, I find a PERFECT pair of cream coloured sandals.  They fit...they were cheap ($60 from $115) and were leather.  I bought two of them on the spot (hehe...I couldn't help it...so cheap and they're slightly different in colour - one's beige, and the other is light light pink) and went home promptly to bask in my happiness.   Life is Good although I still don't have my walking sandals.  I guess those will have to wait for next year.

      Yesterday, I went to a housewarming party at a good friend's place. We entertained ourselves from 6-12am by talking and playing pool, foosball and a made-up version of board Curling (curtesy me). Sushi and duck was the yummy part of the meal! Thanks J! =)  It was nice to be close * came out onto the BAL-cony (not BALL-cony) as I was kindly corrected by another attendee - had some quick one-on-one time I was craving. Leaned in.  The Dead Sea Products lady was crazy pushy. Talk about a good marketer. I wonder if she trained for this job 'cause, wow, that's some mouth she has on her face. Now, I can say with quite a bit of confidence that I am a prudent shopper - I bargan, drain out and talk off the salesperson usually. People who know me well feel sorry for the CS agents I ever have to deal with. My cell phone plan is indicative of this fact: I probably have the best, non-plan, individualized for me, Queen Complainer, that Rogers AT&T has to offer without going under as a company. =D In any case, Ms. Dead Sea Products lady talked my EAR OFF for a good 40 minutes. I ended up buying a soap (which I did not intend to buy but was the cheapest item of their line), and NOT buying the mask (which I  had  intended to buy).  I guess buying the soap was just to spite her a bit given her unending information spewl and enthusiasm. The vindictive side of me is pleased because although I did not get the product I wanted (I guess I can always go back another time to pick it up), I know she felt shafted (spending so much time trying to sell me products - I think I know their whole line now) selling me only a bar of soap (for $11.99). The downside is I felt  guilty (!)  for not buying more of her products! Unbelievable nerve.  Just a tip for all your marketers out there: know when to draw the line.  I was ready to buy, if she didn't talk for so long.  Sheesh.  I had fun stealing the sushi from the platter before people arrived (until SOMEONE busted me by announcing to the group what I did). I worked SO hard at covering my tracks too...you would never have noticed those 2 missing pieces with my unspeakable skilled handiwork. Boo.  Funny moment of the evening -  Premise: On the BAL-cony - a few of us guests were hanging out from his apartment on the 5th floor watching passerbyers beneath us. A couple younger guys strutted slowly by, giving us the "eye".  Attendee 1 (to all of us on the balcony) : What are they looking at? Attendee 2: I don't know...(as the boys below continue staring up)... Attendee 2 (yelling out to the boys at the bottom) : Hey! Quit staring! Whaddya looking at? You wanna take this up? Huh? Huh? Attendee 1: Yeah...come on up and we'll settle this! C'mon!!! Attendee 2: Yeah! We'll take you on. You and me. Midnight. Backup Chorus: Yeah, come up and look for us. At midnight. You and Me. My name is J (host who lives there), room number 504. We might look a little different at midnight but we'll settle it nonetheless.  Those guys never did show up, I don't think...but it was funny anyway. Seeing how all of us who were on the balcony shouting stuff below did not stay past midnight and J, the host, was not present when this occured. He might have shot us had he have known.
