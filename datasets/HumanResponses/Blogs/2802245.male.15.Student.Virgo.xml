      Pointlessness strikes me, after a full week off at half-term I am more than ready to go back to school. In fact I do believe this is a evil capitalist plan to dominate the world through bored school children... But I think that's just me...

      Meh,  pity, mtgnews.com is now closing, it was a really good site for spoilers and stuff, being able to come up with the goods as it were, about a week before the set was actually released.  anyhow, the magic community at school is alive and well, and soon I shall be able to complete my plan of world domin- oh wait, I didn't say that.   Something I don't get though, what is it that makes n00bs think they're top of the world just cuz they're deck no longer loses horribly on turn 4?  well, that's me for today, until next time, may you topdeck like a pr0.

      Meh,  Decided to take a break from the random slagging of Chinese School,  (alright, so I haven't bothered my ass to actually post the dirt yet but be patient) So we had the Easter Concert today... In fact, just got back from it... /me sigh... I really need to get a life...  Anyway... Instead I have decided to start random slagging of the Taiwanese "President"  (people who know me *should* know why I put in quotation marks)  A long long time ago... In a Continent far far away...  A fairly unpopular "president" was trying o get re-elected... His name was Chen Shui Bian  (don't worry if you don't think you can pronounce it, you probably won't ever need to) http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/25/content_317890.htm  The day before the election, he was "shot" by an unknown assassin...  Yes.. He was *that* desperate...  Anyway, that's the background story...  The joke is in a Chinese TV show I watch, its a topical discussion show where people randomly talk about current affairs.  Here's a transcript:  Man 1: Strange how after Chen Shui Bian got shot he still strutted about. Man 2: Yeah, wasn't he shot in the stomach? Man 1: yeah, he was shot in the stomach after the bullet went round his back in a circular trajectory *between* his clothes and skin. Man 2: They rushed him to hospital right? Man 1: When he was getting surgery, it looked like he was getting a circumcised Man 2: And the bullet trajectory, it looked as though before it got anywhere near him, it had to go through about 8 people  :D My 2 cents Meh...

      Meh...  Now I seriously Pissed off...  I've had to post this one again cuz of my stupidity... Or rather, my lack of understanding of Blogger... Its a long story, adn i still want to get some CS in before I get kicked off the comp...  Anyway... Long time since I last posted, well, *check blog*  4 days... seems like an eternity... anywho...  here goes  Friday: Not much of note, my plan of ripping of second years in trades suffered a major setback as i realised Yao had already taken everything that was worth anything off them. for that matter, this isn't a major setback, more like a fatal one... :/  Saturday: Saturday we had the Chess thingy... we came second and Sullivan won... surprise surprise...  Only real thing that is worth mentioning is that Simon lost in like 10 moves to a crappy guy from St Malachy's  Sunday: *rubs hands in glee* Oh ho ho, don't get me started on Sunday, *realises* oh wait I already have got myself started on Sunday... in fact I think I'll devote a *drum roll* WHOLE post on Sunday, *listens to sound of one hand clapping*  Bleh...

      /me sigh  Heh...  Almost everybody in the class went to the School's cup match and it ended up as 6 people left in the class...  The stupid thing is we ended up playing Monopoly in maths...  If I learned one thing today, it is that corruption is funny....  And definately profitable :D  and I'll bet this will come back to haunt me when I'm older  Meh...

      Hmm... I was in the City Centre today after school, and went round to play some Magic only to find Johnny has gone and closed for St Patrick's Day...  Decided that there was no point so I wandered around a bit and realised that in truth, there was absolutely nothing to do...   So I went back to the bus stop and decided to take a round trip around the City Hall. Major bad idea as while I was a-wandering a huge...mmm... make that *HUGE*.... crowd built up waiting for the concert... I decided to go throught the crowd since it didn't look like it was going to be that hard, but I made one mistake in that I left out the fact that I had a large school bag to carry as well.  Uh oh...  After about 15 minutes of "excuse me", "thanks", "could I get across please", I finally made it through...  Phew...  That is one thing I'm not trying again...  Of course the ground was a complete mess...  Crisp Packets Straws Bottles It was sticky too...  hmm I think I'll stick in a Philip joke now... but I don't think he reads this so I won't bother or maybe...

Bit my tongue really badly and it still hurts when I talk/eat/move tongue  Meh, Clarinet teacher gonna kill me when she sees the state of my scales :/  Ah the joys of topics which aren't related in any way... ^^;;  Should really go practise but can't be bothered...

      Meh,  There's a huge questionnaire thingy going round my friends, strangely enough if you hand us a questionnaire on paper we'd all either go "okay...." Or in Jamie's case "**** off" but of course stick it on e-mail and its the best thing since sliced bread...  Yeah, I know, I need a life...  Anyway, I got Hell Week in 10 days  Thursday - Maths Challenge Friday - Rest Saturday - Chess Tournament  Sunday - Concert Monday - Music lesson at 6:30 Tuesday - Music exam Wednesday - Easter concert rehearsal Thursday - Easter Concert  :/ *sigh*

I just come upstairs from about 10 minutes of "don't do this don't do that do this do that, oh by the way, we give you the freedom you want so don't complain..." It takes quite alot of self control to stop my self from screaming FUCK OFF, :/ what can you do... bah now to do something creative  oh and by the way go read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, have been spending about 6 hours reading it now and eyes are getting sore...  :P

       The week of Hell , folks, the week of hell. Ok, i got orals, english 700 word essay, this, that Duke of Ed, and other crap. And then I have to revise for the f*%$ing exams. F#Â£k them. At least my website is up at  urlLink dragontail.tk . It needs some updating, but i cant do that till the exams are over. Yaaaay. At least we can have a few LAN parties after the exams though. Some CS and generals/ RA2 would soothe the mind... and I can 0wn! >:D muwahha-*cough* ahem. Anyway, James said he would kick me off if i didnt post :( ain't my fault :( Bad times, people, till next time,   Jamie  ----------------------------------------  feel like punching the wall?

      Bleh,  I suppose I should be thankful for the better computers in school, but not being able to go  anywhere  is a major disadvantage... Hotmail's banned, mtgnews.com is banned, bob, your uncle is banned... sometimes it makes you wonder whether or not we  are  moving towards ONESTATE... If you don't know what that is, well, go listen to it...  urlLink BBC website  Scroll down the page and you'll find "We" read the description and then click on Saturday Edition to listen...  I wonder if Orwell is pleased he's being semi-plagiarised, hmm not even too sure that's a word... >  Meh...

      Bleh... I'm back.. mostly because I couldn't get the other two stooges to post... yeah, If you're confused by the last post I shall free you from your tormented mind...  I tried to get dragontail to stop swearing, which resulted in this particular conversation  Me: Try to cut the swearing down, its like 50% of it is swearing Dragontail: No there isn't, there's only 3 words, so the post would have to be about 6 words long. Me: It is 6 words long... Well it  is  now... Dragontail: WTF?  Yes... its another story of me abusing my power.... Ah the joys of a dictatorship... Bleh... :/

      [EDIT - and here's the rest of the post :P - Jim]   Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm . You know what? I can tell you something. Three words plus some dots (I do recall someone else who uses dots a lot :|):    STEAM SUCKS... BADLY   Yes, all 1.6GB of it. Funny the way it takes up more RAM than the Windows kernel itself. Also, weapons are "reversed", so any old 1.5 models you wanted to converted either has to be mirrored (have to use Milkshape which i can;t be bothered) or the models appear on the left hand although it says clearly in the options menu:   weapons: right handed  >:(  Also due to the fact none of the hosting options work, or/and STEAM has generated 29 error reports in 2 hours of playing >:((

      Meh...  Was working on a bit of VB this morning... thought came to me after the 800th time my quadratics program gave me a error... I assume you all have probably seen The Matrix Revolutions... yes.. If you haven't there's nothing you desperately need to go see either... But anyway,   *SPOILER WARNING* - although slightly late and pointless  but if my small and crap program is about 50 lines of code, and all it does is calculate the answer to a quadratic equation, and remember this is in a high level language, not something like binary :/  how much would the oracle take to write???  ...  Go figure...  Bleh :/

      Having had the fortune to "stay" in china... The first thing to strike is...Jet lag... but as soon as one goes onto the roads... The traffic is the next thing....  having stepped off a plane with less than no sleep in 24 hours I was confronted by a very seedy looking woman taxi driver in a leather jacket looking like she was about to offer me drugs... Crack anyone?  now to full rant mode... I was nearly been run over more times in a span of a week than I have been in 15 years... and here you can get run over by all kinda of traffic in the average city... taxis... vans... the common lorry and the occasional 16 wheeler... oh yeah and bicycles and the often seen bike with a cart stuck to the back and three wheels in total....  to negotiate the average road.... well.... the average road is about 3 lanes either side with a lane for bikes and other bipedal vehicles and people.... did I mention a lot of people?  anyways... understandably the cross road is very large... understand that pedestrian lights are rare... the chances of finding one when you need it is like ... uh... something very rare happening...  the best one can do is find the interval between one light and the next and run... hoping the cars perpendicular to the road you are crossing do not decide to turn....  drivers are also very fond of their horns... I mean very.... they can't get enough of it... bus drivers and some taxi drivers have it worst... its like a disease... thou must  spread the good word by a deafening blast of the horn... if the car/bike/lorry/person/monkeyonashetlandpony doesn't move.... repeat... perseverance always pays off....  I have already had complaints about this post being the equal to the length of war and peace... but I promise.... no russians...  but I regress... tis the end of post 1/10... be happy that pinky decided to grant me post position in the blog :)... He may yet regret it  p.s... no proof reading  [Edit: Did the spell checking etc... God I feel like I'm a forum moderator or something :/ - Jim]

      Meh, Haven't posted for quite a while, and got kinda bored with randomly slagging people.  I do have quite a good quote for you though, its from the Forbes magazine, about GPS.  (I hope I won't get sued for this :/ )  Global Positioning Satellites are so cool that they reinforce one's belief in God. If one chip can communicate with 3 satellites that are orbiting the earth to tell you where - within 18 inches - your teenage daughter is and how fast - within a tenth of a foot per hour - her boyfriend is coming on to her, then all this stuff about sparrows falling out of trees and God in heaven being aware of it is probably true. Certainly its technically possible. My idea of a killer franchise is a drive-through that staple-guns GPS chips into your toddlers, teenagers, aging parents, household pets, and car keys.  rotfl  Bleh ^^;;

      Bleh... Alright... I'll admit it... I'm actually revising...:/ I can't be bothered to write much... ah bugger it... I got a bike today.. and while my dad was paying for it...the woman at the counter asked... would you like to become a member of our clubcard? You'll get a five pound off voucher since you spent more than 50 pounds...  My dad obviously agreed, and I, expecting a form to fill out, walk away... 10 minutes later I return, thinking that it should be over by now... and lo and behold, "Uh... how long have you been employed?", "What do you work as?" the form they were filling in looked like something you'd get from the Home Office... along with a booklet telling you how to fill it out :/  Meh...

Blogger has gone and changed its... well... its everything... I personally think the new graphics are swet, but then again, people don't particularly like change.. so you never know whst the response is gonna be..  a random link for the day:  urlLink Inktank.com  Barry's doing a pretty good job... go check it out :D  Meh

      A huge input into the blog. Well perhaps not. buy anyway. Better note down everything before it runs out of my mind. quote from simon:  Today was quite boring, had to listen/watch Jamie swearing for an hour as we couldn't get the game to work...   exuse me simon, mr smarty ass, i didnt swear a lot, same as you...  Check this out... the first word of every post from James:   Ah, after, meh, pointlessness, grrr, /megroans, ..., meh, w00t, hmmm, meh, ow, hmm, /mesign, meh, meh, meh, meh, just, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, bleh, bleh...   no offence to James, but see a pattern there?

      great. I just heard from James that he *might* be getting a Radeon X800XT, a real monster when it comes to graphics cards. I'll just have to sit there going "awww" while he points and laughs. great! :( Damn them ceapo canadian currency. I wish I could buy a Geforce 6800 Ultra to get back my revenge, but it is around Â£400 out my reach at the moment, so I think that will be no, somehow.  Just discovered the profile thingy. I entered my birthday correctly, but it says my star sign is virgo, while my true star sign is libra. "Erm, blogger, sort it out!" I thought. Then as i thought about it, i realised something.  The date is month/day/year across the pond, not day/month/year over here . I changed it, and it came up with Libra correctly. tsk, trust them americans!  The new colour scheme is waaay better, if anyone else agrees. But no one probably reads this so oh well :/ Apparently, Simon might start blogging. This could let onto a big blog if simon bothers his ass and posts regularly...  tribute to l33tn3ss  Jamie

I went and changed the format... I was  that  bored... Cousin is starting to send me up the wall... and I will upload cute and cuddly pictures of the brat as soon as I get this uploading thing working... which could be sometime with this 56k connection... bah...

      Sorry James for the lack of postin'. Yeah. Time to catch up. Just worked another shift today. Must update you on the more interesting side of work:  There are many customers who buy stuff from the place (obviously). I have divided them into groups:   [a] The T-Rexes -  They only buy meat. Meat. More Meta and M - E - A - T. Meaty meat. Big chunks, small chunks, oh and fish! But thats still meat, right? So Meat and fish. Cold meat, frozen meat, seafood, shrimps, fish, lobsters, big flat flatfish the size of a tennis racket... [you get the picture, okay?!]   [b] The Vegans -  I' not gonna go very far. These people buy VEGS! Thats it. No cans, no meat, no nothing but vegs and fruit. Like, eat some meat will ya?   [c] The Can Lovers  - usually crazy looking bastards who looooooooooooove cans. Like, their whole shopping composes of, guess what... cans. Canned fish, canned vegs, Cans made out of tofu, canned stick insects, canned cans, canned flaming dead black sheep, fried cans, broken flying cans that serve soup and loooks for terrorists, but nothing else. The last 6 I mentioned were not true, but you get the picture. Â¬_Â¬   [d] The crazy son of a b%&#hes who buys the entire shop -  No explaination. Just bad luck for thr people who have to pack bags. That would be me *cough* >:(   [e] The utter dumbass  - Okay, I've seen one of those. This black woman orders some chicken legs, a bag of them. She walks around the shop while they are being delivered. The chicken legs are then put into a trolley by a guy. He then leds the woman back to the trolley telling her,  Theres the legs madam."  The man walks away.  The woman looks into the trolley  and says,  "Whos shopping is this? Anyway, wheres my chicken legs?"  ROFLMAO!!!!1!1  Sorry, I don't get much excitement in work. Yes, I know. Its not funny. But believe me, after working 4 or 5 hours non stop, anything is funny.  Except more work. Yeah.  ...  I'mprobably ordering a new mp3 player very soon. Probably next Monday. Its going to a the Monolith II 7010 512Mb Black Aluminium version. Plus some Sennhieser MX 500 Stero earphones, if I can affored 'em. They are expensive at Â£20, but apparently their sound quality is dead on explosive. Sounds like the earphones fore me :D The only bad thing about the mp3 player is that it doesn't support OGG Vorbis encoding. Arrrrrrghh, I'm not stuck with MP3 am I??! OGG vorbis (or is it vobis? I can't remember) is faaaaar better than MP3. It's smaller than a MP3 song yet sounds better.  urlLink www.monolith-europe.com  has some pics of the black monolith player. Pretty neat, no?  In all due respect James, here ya go. A nice long post. Now off to Ghosanomics for some updates. well after dinner actaully. I need some refuelling before I can function properly again. You have no idea how much energy 9 hours of work needs.    Tribute to thy ROFLMAOCOPTERness, (yes, I know its rofocopter, :/)    Jamie

       Bleh...      I'm going to America tomorrow,       Which means I'll have to get up at 6 so I can get on a coach for 10 hours...      :(      But I won't be posting till I get back, so be patient, (like you want to read the crap I write :P)      Anyway, there's always the miniscule possibility that the other two stooges will actually post...      (Jamie, Don't complain about it being a one man show if you aren't going to contribute, ditto to Simon)      Emma, hope you have a nice flight back...      (even if it's just so I won't have to make a bad airplane joke)      And I shall see you all on Wednesday, when I will no longer be cut off from civilisation...      Damn that felt like I was writing my will or something :/      Meh...

       Bleh...   Cousin got a set of one of those "My First Set of Culinary Tools" thingies, but I would like to point out that it might be better named "My First Set of Lethal Weaponry" or something to that effect,   First of all there was the rolling pin...   It  looked  like one of the flimsy plastic ones that the toy makers use thermoplastics to make, light, cheap, absurdly colourful, probably melts on hot days, debates on its non toxicity still raging... You know the sort of thing...   Well, it hurts when you're getting hit across the head with one...    repeatedly    Don't tell me anything " You're bigger, fend her off" etc etc,   YOU TRY IT WHEN SHE'S SITTING ON YOUR SHOULDERS   You drop her, you die, not to mention that I'm in no particular hurry to get a guilty conscience, I've lasted 15 years without one, I'd like to keep it that way...   You don't, you get beaten to death...   :/    Then there were the biscuit outline thingies, the ones you use to cut shapes out of dough...   Well these were metal...    and pretty frickin' sharp    And of course, I'm currently covered in outlines of goldfish, whales, butterflies...   Did I mention she bit me?   Getting her off the high chair, as usual, then suddenly    *crunch*    She bit through my t-shirt, leaving a little red semi-circle of teeth marks on my shoulder...   I suppose that's my punishment for letting her watch Kill Bill with me...   Argh... Need more Oreos...   Meh...

       Bleh...     &nbsp;   Went to do a bit of shopping today, (or possibly more accurately, got dragged to the mall, per Mother's orders for Aunt to get me clothes...)     &nbsp;   During my wanderings I came across a pet shop...     &nbsp;   Before I continue I must stress that I wouldn't count myself as a Radical Animal Rights Activist,     &nbsp;   For that matter I wouldn't call myself a pet lover...Or even Pet Owner &nbsp; ( ever)    &nbsp;   but still, it was quite disturbing seeing the dogs in 1m by 1m by 1m perspex boxes...     &nbsp;   There were 2 or 3 dogs in each box, and it was a row of boxes, with another row directly on top...     &nbsp;   Wire lined the bottom of each box, presumably air holes have been drilled somewhere...     &nbsp;   and it was  filthy      &nbsp;   Some of the puppys were rolling in their own excrement, others were busy licking the behinds of their compatriots...     &nbsp;   A young girl pointed her finger at one puppy, who immediately started to lick the spot where her finger was pressed against the glass...     &nbsp;   This continued, even long after the girl had left...     &nbsp;   Two guys walked past,     &nbsp;    Ha! look at that fucked up dog!     &nbsp;   Strange how animal rights activists never got on the case of pet shops...     &nbsp;   :/     &nbsp;   Until next time:     &nbsp;   God doesn't protect fools or young children...     &nbsp;   No, He leaves that for Persons with a charitable mentality and Parents...     &nbsp;   Thank NEEITS (that's Non Existing Entity In The Sky, "Thank You" to Claire for that term ^^;;) I'm neither...     &nbsp;   Meh...

       Bleh...     &nbsp;   Back from a day of wandering, and meandering...     &nbsp;   Cousin got a new car seat, and decided not to like it.     &nbsp;   So she cried...     &nbsp;   and cried...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   and cried...     &nbsp;   She cried until her crying could probably be used as a frickin carrier wave    for UHF signals...     &nbsp;   *sigh*     &nbsp;   Twas  not  a good day for my ears...     I  did &nbsp;find out the extent of Uncles driving skills though,&nbsp;    &nbsp;  It was actually quite comforting...    &nbsp;  Well "comforting" meaning     &nbsp;  "I-know-when-we-hit-something-at-this-speed-I-won't-feel-a-thing..."    &nbsp;  Go figure...    &nbsp;   Hmm tired, going to go sleep now...     &nbsp;   Miss Emma... :(     &nbsp;   Meh...

        Bleh...&nbsp;   A visit to Niagara Falls today, and about 150m into American Territory before deciding it was to much effort and giving up...  &nbsp;  Pictures will be up...  &nbsp;   eventually   &nbsp;  Since I won't be home till the 21st of August...  &nbsp;  Only... 26 days left...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  On to other news...  &nbsp;  My assessment of Uncle's driving has been changed,  &nbsp;  He's  suicidal ...  &nbsp;  He went and tried to take on a 16 wheeler lorry...  &nbsp;  No, seriously...  &nbsp;  Its a 3 lane motorway, we're in the&nbsp;lane at the very left, the lorry was  at the one on the right...  &nbsp;  And we both wanted to change to the centre...  &nbsp;  At one point I could see the ring on the lorry driver's extended middle finger...  &nbsp;  :/  &nbsp;  And yes, all of this at about 80 miles an hour...  &nbsp;  The other thing I learned today was   never   trust a female with navigation...  &nbsp;  Yes, I'm well aware of how stereotypical/sexist/chauvinistic that comment seems and I apologise, but hear me out first...  &nbsp;  To get back to Toronto&nbsp;from Niagara Falls we had to get back on the&nbsp;motorway, we had no idea how and decided to look at the map, that yielded&nbsp;no clues either, so we drove along until we saw a sign that pointed us in the right direction, so we followed it along, and sure enough there was a junction to turn right ahead&nbsp;to lead us up onto the motorway.  &nbsp;  While the driving was going on&nbsp;Aunt was looking quizzically at the map, and as the turn came she suddenly told us we were going to the wrong way, and she'd explain, but we definitely shouldn't turn right... So we listened to her (as she was rather hysterical at this stage and was complaining about how we didn't listen) and turned left, doing a rather large circuit of the neighbourhood.  &nbsp;  We were completely confused by her explanation and decided to ask a police officer...&nbsp;   "Get back to Toronto? Sure, just follow that road until you get to the junction, then&nbsp;turn right, it'll lead you straight&nbsp;onto the&nbsp;Expressway"   If anyone wants to prove me wrong on this point, feel free...  &nbsp;  Meh...

      Got off my ass to go to the cinema today. First time in 3 months!!! Went to see Spiderman 2, decent, but nothing special.  Parents just don't get it. You don't want to tell them the whole story of the film and how the whole thing went when you want them to pick you up from standing in the bloody rain.  Also, a note to Emma, after discussion and deliberation, I have decided to laugh off your death threat as something done when somebody is greatly deprived of something. Haha  Simon - Look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone (Jet)

      Bleh...   Mission Accomplished, with minimal tears :)&nbsp;   well the prawn crackers helped...   A lot...   And it was all going well...   Until the real sticking point came...   Trying to get her to sleep, sans aunt...   I sorta went "Isn't it your bed time now?"   And before I even got to "time" her eyes had filled with tears...   I had to&nbsp;talk nicely for about 10 minutes for her&nbsp;to calm down...   Yes... contrary to popular belief, it IS possible for me to be nice...   Thankfully, Aunt and Uncle arrived back, taking the whole thing off my hands,   That's one of the few times I get to say "whole thing" as opposed to "whole mess"   :D   Hmm   It appears I&nbsp;will be on a road trip this weekend, so I probably won't post,   Then again, Uncle might get another of his emergency meetings :/   I've been told that Uncle is a mad driver...   It'll be interesting to compare him with my mum, who currently holds my record for most death defying traffic stunt...   That's another story for another day...&nbsp;  Meh...

       Bleh...    &nbsp;  Have been relegated to Babysitting duties, Cousin is currently sitting in the corner happily blowing bubbles, well, to be more exact, happily  trying  to blow bubbles...    &nbsp;  I can think of 2 reasons why small children enjoy blowing bubbles,     &nbsp;    The fact that they are bubbles, spherical and shiny, bursts when you touch them etc...    The child is just happy because of a oxygen high, resulting from the hyper ventilation involved when they are trying to blow the bubbles.     bah, better get back before she does a rendition of "Baby's Day Out" :/    Meh...

      OK, a few points to sort out  1) Jamie, I feel your pain. OK, not really, but it seemed like a nice thing to say. Also, I'm sorry for stealing your signatures, I'll do different random song lyrics instead.  2) Does anyone know what our DoE projects are on? She didn't exactly inform us well!  3) James, "She's 2!" is a perfectly good excuse, in the same way blondes can go "I'm blonde!" and get away with bloody murder. Oh and have you read the prequel to "The Da Vinci Code"? You should, it's a good book.  4) I don't look 16 really, do I Jamie? I'm not going to lie on a job application form, and I don't have, as Conor put it, "the Asians" to help me by not caring. Thought about that, eh Jamie?  That seems to be my random rage over. Not gonna be here tomorrow afternoon, so don't get mad if no post (alright James?)  Simon - If you tolerate this your children will be next (Manic Street Preachers)

       Bleh...   Still not an awful lot happening, point though Jamie, I'd  rather  be at home... :/   That's what boredom does to you...   I have no idea what to do for my project, but I'll figure out something I suppose, I'll have about a week to do it when I get back, along with my Tech... :/   Its going to be a busy week...   On to other things..    &nbsp;  Another fact about the cousin I have noticed is her aversion to hair...   Yep...  hair    No problem if its on your head, but if you get hair in say the bath tub, she'll start screaming as soon as she sees it...    &nbsp;  I beginning to wonder if "She's 2!" is actually still a usable excuse...    &nbsp;  Meh...

      Must remind you guys about the Duke of ed project, otherwise, we might&nbsp;f#Â£$ed. Unfortunately, James doesnt have CS to keep him interested.&nbsp;unlucky. Point bout your complaining bout boredom:  Hello guys ! You both have been/still are&nbsp;in some other place par from&nbsp;your freaking bedroom/this country, unlike me who will also have to move to the computer room as my mum&nbsp;attacks my room with paint, hammers and various other letal equiptment, having my stuff&nbsp;burnt in the process, how would you like that. (Now I wait James to&nbsp;come up with some smarty-ass reply like he always does, dont even try it this time, I expect Simon to say: "Hahahahahahaha you suck, I dont give a s*%t, if you caught fire&nbsp;I would come around and pour kerosene on it to make it burn some more, etc, you are un - leet, blahdy blah etc etc etc) Whatever  Hmm, i see that Simon's trying to turn my signiture against me, enough of this nonsense. Simon sig is: Tribute to jamiesunl33tnessdoesntgetasmuchmoneyasconor, which&nbsp;means that although me and Conor both work, Conor gets paid an extra 20p/hour more than I do. I believe than I actaully  earn  money. Tell me again, how much do you earn? Since Simon is more of the mathematical type, hers a little equation for you to work out the answer to the above question:  Y(0)U   x   34(r)\&nbsp; +  f(_)((C))  -   41_1_   x   s(*0*)   -   $7f\_/!!   =   Simon is totally unl33t  lol :P, only j/king    Tribute to&nbsp;thy openmindedness    Jamie

      Meh...  I do pity you James, but at least you only have another month of it to go. I have to live with my little sister for at least another 4 years, on top of the 13 I've already endured.  Grrrrrrrrrrrr  Anyway, I've got very, very bored within 2 or 3 days of being home. Have been doing esceptionally random things like watching daytime TV and putting golf balls up and down the floor of my bedroom (I don't play golf).

(I can see it now in the comments, just about everyone I know going, "Only at times?")    &nbsp;  If Jamie can't sort it out then we'll either have to leave it and hope it fixes itself, or maybe change it permanently...    &nbsp;  Missing Emma :/    &nbsp;  Meh...

       Bleh...  &nbsp;  It was just another day until:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Come on baby, lets go party     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That was disturbing, more so in the fact that my 2 year old cousin had just uttered them...  &nbsp;  So, to ease myself, I sat and watched Gladiator with her on my lap...  &nbsp;  There are those of you who might take this as a warning to keep me away from small children...  &nbsp;  And you may be right...&nbsp;       In&nbsp;other news, I'm told the trip to Niagra&nbsp;Falls will have to be delayed as Uncle will be in a meeting of some kind...    I suppose that will give me more time to do some Flash...     I doubt it, my aunt will have planned something...    *sigh*    She's downloaded these fairytale stories in Mandarin... Cinderella etc...    And is playing them for the Cousin...    And so obviously I'm the only one who pays any attention, (try that for bored to death...)    I swear, the people who are reading them also do the propaganda films...    After my 6th time of Listening to Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling, I have two question...     Why is  the Ugly Duckling  called that? Wouldn't  the supposed "duckling" which was actually an cygnet , or something along those lines be more, well, accurate? I don't mind if you don't agree with me, it  is  a rather moot point...    Secondly, in  Cinderella , the two step-sisters cut off a toe and a heel (respectively) to fit their feet into the silver shoes, afterwards, the narrator said, and this a translation from Mandarin by me, so I can almost guarantee accuracy (Isn't modesty a wonderful thing?)     "The sisters were so angry at their step-sister that their faces turned white"    That was after the prince's "you're my princess" etc etc  Correct me if I'm wrong, but If you've had your big toe, or heel, cut off, the last thing you'd get a rather white face for would be from anger... Let's see... the pain, or perhaps more likely, the  agony , the blood loss... I just can't see anger being worse than those two... especially combined... But then again... what do I know? :/     I know... I like to argue moot points, that are completely pointless (no pun intended)    Meh...

I'm gonna punch you in the face until you bleed to death   And, yes, that was neither here nor there...     &nbsp;   Hmm, I wonder if watching Kill Bill will have a detrimental effect on my cousin... she sort of sat through the first half hour with a sort of rapturous awe...     &nbsp;   In a bad movie&nbsp;I shall find this to my disadvantage some day when I'm assailed by a murderous 6 year-old brandishing a large cleaver :/      But I doubt it somehow...        &nbsp;    hopefully...        &nbsp;    Meh...

       Before...   kinda bored right now >:/ Gonna cycle around the place for a while. See if i can get the m00k3s to run after me :) then they probably thow rocks at me >:| Nah, better not. I'll just cycle to the park... nah, prob full of mo- how about the corner shop - nah, prob full of- erm, the lake? prob full o- eerm, erm, the local roundabout? prob ful- AGH why the hell are the annoying bas***ds running the area?!  Anyway, did some more on the flash. Go to my other blog to see a small gif anim :)  Too bad, I'll leave this half typed and go outside anyway.   After...   Back - just went to the park, only a wee m00k3 there, better than I thought. Sorta cycled in loops, got bored and tried some wheelies and some other crap and *nearly* fell off. [note to self - do not try a BMX biker for a career] Then i hit the curb at high speed and fell off. I was like " holy ****! ", but lucky landed okay on the grass, as I twisted around with my n1nja speed and skillz (correction: uber lucky to land not too badly, although on my knees which dont look too healthy, being wrecked and bloody). Grr, must not wear shorts when cycling next time :/ My left hand is sore cos it smacked off a tree quite fast. Whos the stupid retard who planted it there anyways? Overall, a good trip nonetheless, the pain flows, but it does some good >:)    Tribute to thy retardedbastardwhoplantedthytreeness,  Jamie

      Bleh...  Am sitting here listening to some random fairytale for the cousin's benefit...:/  But judging by the fact that she's happily dumping rubbish onto the ground, I don't think she's listening...  It's quite strange, its an amalgamation of Snow White and Goldilocks... with some overenthusiastic dwarves...  Now to wait for her to go to sleep so I can watch Kill Bill, or maybe The Mummy Returns... I shall see...  *atchoo*  Meh...

      Bleh...  Bah.. Not an awful lot happening, the fire alarm went off as my aunt was cooking, resulting in the cousin doing a world class screaming baby impression...  It also appears I must actually do some work for Jamie for once as opposed to sitting on my backside doing nothing as normal... *sigh* ah well... Brainstorming for ideas time...  BTW nice flash Jamie, although it looks quite similar to your original, but hey... I can't say much... :/  Meh...

Correct me if I'm wrong. overall exellent post. *laughs*  Anyways, seems like I'm getting a 6800 GT muwhahaha. I also done 31 secs of some Flash. Without any resources. Some dudes fighting with axes, throwing knifes and kantanas. Have a look at  urlLink this .   [EDIT]   Got some screenshots now in  urlLink my ghostanomics blog . If you cant see the latest post titled "here ya go" then click archives for 7/04 on the side to see them.     Tribute to thy laughinatsimonnonstopness,  Jamie

      Got a job at the Asian Supermarket. Have to work 9 hours a day at Â£3 an hour. Its the basics, such as packaging, bagging, etc etc. 9 hours seems to take 12 hours. Time slows down in the building just to piss me off. I was so bored and tired that I made a comp to see who had thew biggest orders (i baggage the food into guess what plastic bags). Its kinda joint at the top :)   At number 3...  A fat guy walks into the shop. Real fat. He was six times the width of me, and a lot more times heavier. I swear, i felt the ground shake when he walked past. His order?  Â£450 of packaged burgers, hot dogs, meat, and coke and fanta . It was delivered from the warehouse in boxes, so i luckily didnt have to package it. Funny thing was, the guy couldnt get in/out threw the normal door, so he had to go in/out through the warehouse doors X-D   At number 2...  A woman takes 2 trolley worths of food plus a mass order from the warehouse. I was like holy fuck! I was busily for 5 minutes packaging her stuff and then her husband comes through with another trolley worth. :'( Total order?  Â£790  It must have been their shopping for the year or something.   At number 1...  A man comes on Wednesday with a Â£450+ order of food. Not that big. He then comes on Saturday with another Â£450+ order. Â£ 900+ worth of food in four days ? I'll use a James qoute: " Go figure :/ "  At least i'm getting paid for this. At the end of 8 weeks I will have around Â£400 for working 2 days a week. Enough for a Nice Gryffin or Dita hockey stick and a iPod maybe?  Its all fun I tell yer >    Tribute to thy baggagingness,  Dragontail

      Bleh...  I'm bored again...   There's only so many science fiction novels you can read before you find them tedious and pointless, I'm going for about 30, but I suppose people can start with 0 if they like...  That's life for you...  I'll leave you with this:  Why is it that when you are obsessed about getting sunshine out of oranges you are "crazy" and when you're obsessed about a person you are "in love"? :/  Go Figure...

      Bleh...  In an effort to alleviate my boredom, I obtained a copy of John Wydham's  The Day of The Triffids  as well as about 10 other Science Fiction books, they  should  keep me occupied for the week, but after going through 3 in 36 hours I'm beginning to have doubts...  Anyway, if you should ever be in need of a good book, especially if its Science Fiction (note I didn't use Sci-Fi *shudders* evil term...) then Wydham will not disappoint...  As for The Day of The Triffids, here's a basic synopsis:  The main protagonist, Bill Masen wakes up on Wednesday 8th of May to find the hospital he's in deathly quiet, so he decides to take off the bandages around his eyes himself. The night before everyone in the world had gone out to witness a brilliant meteor shower display, but the green light had a strange effect on the eyes, the population had been blinded... If this wasn't enough, the mysterious plants known as triffids had flourished in the lack of human intervention, before, the strange carnivorous plants with the ability to move were just curiosities... now they were overrunning the country feasting on the vulnerable populace...  It's a rather disturbing book, more so in that it feels like it could be true...  and yes... I now have a phobia of shooting stars and green plants :P  Meh...

I went to High Park today... Its kinda like Central Park... except its not in New York... afterwards we went to China Town in Toronto... its massive...wait that's not right... its MASSIVE, that's better... its quite funny.... even the street signs are in Chinese and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who was white in there.

I might be dictionarily challenged... but I don't tell girls they're weird on a first date :P or talk about the weather *muffled laughter*  anyhoo... I've changed the descrip about the blog... to something more appropriate... considering what it started as, (me ranting...and rambling) to what it is now, (the three of us having a go at each other), so why not...  Sit back folks, and enjoy the show...   By the way, I was never the happiest man in the world, ask anyone I know...  the normal reply is that I'm constantly in a depressed mood... which isn't all that far off...  Everything going okay in the land of nod... or more commonly known as Canada... althoguh I did learn something about them today...  Today was Canada day...think... 4th of July for (obviously) Canada... and we went to a park where they were celebrating... it was all quite normal until the speeches came... they had this Health Minister Guy... Here was the general gist of the speech:   Canada is a great country... blahblahblah... I'm honoured to be with you all to celebrate the 137th birthday of our country...blahblahblah...Canada is greatest country in the world...What is the greatest country in the world? yes... Canada... etc etc    Canada is the greatest country in the world???  Gimme a break... and I thought Americans were self centred... :/  That's it from me for now...   Miss Emma... :(  Bleh...

Did great in Morrowind, till i lost around 2 hours of gaming when the bloody game crashed to desktop for no reason. As reliable as a pile of dog crap, I tell you. Wheres the fun.  Simon's off to South Africa soon. To some nice 6* hotel i presume. I'll just have to do with my 1/4* bedroom :\ Fun, fun, fun. Well, look on the bright side. I've got an great window to look out, and then I will see something Simon won't see in S.Africa! Rain! Hahaha! :/  Anyway, wasted half a day and created  urlLink this . Yes, my dev log/blog. James will take a rager at me, but at least I won't die?! Will i??! Uhoh... Kinda expecting a knife across the ocean being thrown at me...arghhh   tribute to thy l33tn3ss Dragontail

      OK, OK, I'm going to post/rant (again).  1. My cat - Jesus he can be annoying. I was up at 7:15 yesterday to play in a tantrix tournament (blitz 3-hour thingy) and in the middle of it the cat starts walking around screaming it's head off wanting something. So I ignored it. So it screamed some more. So I ignored it. And then my dad got out of bed to deal with him in it's usual grumpy fashion, after I had been distracted for 5 minutes : 2. James - If you are going to use French to get cross with me, at least use proper, gramatically correct French. "Tu comprends" - OK?  I'm going to stop ranting now.  I was reading the paper, and there was a story about how the police aren't allowed to use bicycle puncture kits in the interest of their safety. I quote, "I'm allowed to use a section 5 firearm but I'm not allowed to fix my bicycle!" Suckers.  4 days until I get (nearly) killed by Jamie and Conor, and then take it all out on Joe :D  Simon - I think my head is gonna explode (Ash)

As for the links Jamie put up, here's a quote:       "We caution people not to write about bombs because if they're going on vacation, their travel plans will be disrupted,"     lol ^^    Still not an awful lot happening the country North of the US of A,  Cousin still as fat, cute, disturbing as ever...  I'm still as skinny as ever...  and as bored...  *sigh*  I give up,  I WANT TO GO HOME!!!!!!!  There...  nope...  Still bored...  :/  I shall leave you with a bad pun... not sure if its worse than my usual ones, but still:  "What do you want to be? A big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?" "A mediocre beaver in a stream!" "???" "Then I could do any  DAM  thing I want!"  -_-;;  Before you start throwing things folks,  I didn't make it up!

       Bleh...    Ah the start of another depressing day...    The boredom...    *sigh*    Hopefully the cousin will shut up...    I doubt that will ever happen...    On the other hand I'm going to get a mp3 player maybe while I'm here, maybe when I get back...       But     Mum has set a study plan for me in the dying days of the holidays...    I have to do:   1/2 an hour of clarinet practice,   A4 page of Chinese, writing and stuff,   Maths stuff that I don't understand...    :/      but if I do this every day until I go home, (that's 2 weeks) I get an iRiver iHP H120...    :D    *is less depressed than before*    Meh...

Jamie and Simon need to be poked to make posts, but I'm not going to bother...      *sigh*      Since there's nothing to do I've decided to sink into depression...      Might as well...

      Bleh...  This is part 2 of my  extremely long and boring  description of my trip to the US...  I'm not sure why I'm actually writing this at all, but I might as well, since there's nothing better to do...   Monday   Half 5 wake up call as we were leaving at half 6,  took another arbitrarily long bus journey to Washington DC...  We've been lucky so far in that everytime that we've got on the coach, it starts raining, and when we arrive at our destination, the weather suddenly turns sunny...No idea why, but it happens...:/  Unfortunately, as soon as we set foot on the Lincoln Memorial, the heavens opened  and decided that sprinklers were out, buckets are better for disposing of water...  This continued on for the rest of the day, you'll see what I mean when I get back home and upload some pictures...  Back to the hotel after that...   Tuesday   Got up at 4 AM...not exactly the most fun I've ever had..  No... wait, not 4AM, 3AM...  The alarm clock in the hotel was an hour fast...  No idea what happened for the rest of the day, wandered about in semi-daze...  and suddenly I'm back home again...  Meh...

       Bleh...  I be back!  *looks around*             *Tumbleweed blows past*    *sigh*   Ah well, I'm wrecked after 3000 miles in 4 days,  Day by day then...   Saturday    Got up at 5:30AM, no idea how and when I got on the coach, but I did, and we set off for the border...  At about 10 we get to Rainbow Bridge, the main crossing point at Niagara Falls, waited for a bit on the bridge for the coaches in from to get processed by Immigration and when the rather surly policewoman finished checking our papers, (my British passport got a raised eyebrow), we set off for the first stop, Boston.. Well, after another rather surly (Anyone spot a pattern here?) policeman told the driver "to get a move on"  Boston came, after about 9 hours, and we did a tour of Harvard. That was rather amusing, since they had a statue of Harvard himself, (even though they had no idea what he looked like), the wrong date for the founding of the school, (1638 instead the actual 1636), and had some completely random person added to the list of founders...:/  After this it was about 8:30, so we got to the hotel, dumped various things, and looked for somewhere for dinner. Nearby was Quincey Market, with its multitudes of fast food places and shops. More interesting was the guy doing comedy outside. He wasn't bad, although the most amusing part was when he performed the "sexy trick", which he claimed "everytime I've done this trick someone from the audience comes up and kisses me" Yep, sure enough, after his first failed attempt a woman from the crowd comes up and kisses him,  but  when he succeeds the second time, four men come up in succession to kiss him, more disturbingly, a 5 year old also went up...  Well, after that my view of Americans went on a rollercoaster ride, the people at Immigration don't exactly push themselves to the top of my Christmas card list, but I suppose the new national sport of the USA is currently paranoia... some decent comedians though I suppose...:/   Sunday   Unsure of when I got up exactly, and since I can't remember it was obviously too early, left for New York, which meant another arbitrarily long coach journey...  Got there, eventually, and wandered about various places, Rockefeller Centre, (or maybe center, depending on preference), Times...uh...Blob? Seriously though, I can't really see a polygon let alone a square, so best word to describe it would probably be blob...  The next stop was the Intrepid Museum...  *Insert rant about stupid paranoid Americans here, use your imagination, the author is too tired*  We stood waiting outside for about 30 minutes in the scorching sun while the stupid security people checked out everyone...  *mutters*  The museum consists of the Intrepid Aircraft Carrier, Growler Submarine...  And a Concorde....  yep... a concorde...  anyway, because of renovations or something you weren't even allowed on to the flight deck,  After that it was a boat trip round the Statue of Liberty,  I'll finish this tomorrow, too tired right now...  Meh...

      Just back from the caravan at Portballintrae. It was TIRING. Anyway, a brief synopsis and observations:   1) The sea  - Jesus, the sea is COLD. Even in a wetsuit!  2 ) Balance  - Balance is a wonderful possession, it's just that neither I nor my dad possess it. First of all, I, following the lead of others making fools of themselves, took a running jump from the harbour to land on the board. I landed on it, but not only did it tip over (like it did for everyone else) but it flipped up and hit me on the head :S Great. Then, on the donut with my dad behind the speedboat (great fun at 25 mph), my dad gets his toes stuck in the water and flies of the donut. Now, what happens to me sitting on one side of the donut if I suddenly lose 85kg from the other side? Splash. Great.   3) Sherbet straws  - I don't get how 340 sherbet straws can bring so much happiness to the lives of 3 12-year-olds.   4) Water pistols  - Long story short, girl with water pistol - with 5 nozzles, person annoying her. She shoots. She hits him with the right 3. Guess who's standing beside him...and where the other two went. :S   5) Random people  - The cousin of the person who owns the caravan 2 across for the one I was staying in was up to visit. Apparently she's in my year at Methody, yet we didn't recognise each other. Strange.   6) School of Rock  - We watched this last night. Is quite funny, especially James as the role of Laurence the keyboard player - "now is not a time for reading Laurence, now is the time for rocking" - hehehe. Bloody annoying Chinese subtitles on it though - why do they have random English characters in it though?  That was my weekend in a nutshell.  Simon - Don't laugh at me, don't look away (Keane)

      Sheshkerli nomads have declared war on me...lovely.  Right, I'm just gonna make my own custom preloader, then Episode 1, the Way will be ready. But being ambitious, i'm starting Episode 2, A Saviour from the Way. I'll just say that Rhue teams up with "Red Hair" to save a lady who was taken hostage by Blue Scarves, notorious bandits.  *Yawn* Goodnight, Shecklers.

      And my Sheckolollies are tasting good today! And news that David Blunkett is getting ready for one of his crackdowns, this time against bad language on British TV!   Deadline, I should be able to meet it. Have&nbsp; screenie here ^^  http://img66.exs.cx/img66/8246/Wanderers1Screen.jpg Proof that I am working and almost done. Let's see...let's take a picture of the workplace too. The library's huge though :/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://img66.exs.cx/img66/6782/Wanderers1Workspace.jpg  THESE STUPID F-BEEP-ING TAGS! Right, screw this direct linking, it's f-BEEP-ing up the toolbar thing on the side.  &nbsp;  Note that the three Lyns aka Assassins who are not being slaughtered are still in the same place as in the movie screenshot above. This is merely due to the fact that I haven't done their fighting bit yet.   But I shall be back...with my movie next time...at least I hope i will...meh...

      And a call to all you graduates of Sheckingversity.  I'm slowly progressing on my movie. Don't expect it to be the best...i should be able to make the deadline. Jamie, me, you and Fish need to talk on msn in a convo, most likely Monday to decide on the forums? Fish is considering quite seriously. I'll stick in a pound a month instead of 50p. Call me generous ^^. The reason i wasn't on today was because i was working at mum's takeaway. Don't expect me on tomorrow either. I'll just be working on Friday for this week...normally just Sat. 3Fusion sounds good and l33t i must say and uhmm...i shall visit Sheckington now. So goodnight. Or goodmorning i should say...(geez...four in the f-BEEP- morning.)  Tull ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      was talking 2 fish he said  perhaps you should tell him if he reduced dragontail, to the standard that i am now thinking for as a standard of about 25MB.... i would definately agree to give him 200mb for free  which would be with him getting 225 in total&nbsp;and also, he would have to agree to the new use policy for both accounts which would account to sooner for him than when i intend to fully bring it in though he could be assured that i couldnt be assed with the copyright thing   and&nbsp;you can probaly&nbsp;get jonny 2 increase it after u reduce it   Forums      the forum i made wasnt for the public its just for us to use cause i want ideals for my new movie and using the blog means it will get relaly crowded with posts so thats why i used the forum        Beckett   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      Got a chance to post before I go and play footie with some friends. For the site, I ask Beckett to send me all the .html files in a zip to my gmail, I want to make a few minor changes, such as font consistency, parts of the writing, and some other shit. Dont expect&nbsp;it returned soon, though,&nbsp;maybe in&nbsp;1 or&nbsp;2 days maybe. I'll spend&nbsp;5 minutes a day trying to fix&nbsp;that all up. Also, all the PCs are the QUB computational PCs my dad has, and he has decided to replace his old networking/try out a new one, with a new&nbsp;switch, so&nbsp;he told me&nbsp;(phoned from China) to look at possible configs. I also decided&nbsp;to reformat the other old athlon 600 pc and install a fresh copy of XP for no reason.   Anyways, theres a slight problem with the forum business. The forum was suppose&nbsp;to be for all 3 sites,  dragon-tail.tk, blackghoststudios.tk  and  dbeckett.co.uk , so it cant be just called " Black Ghost Studios Forum ". It has to be for a name for all three sites' forum. Maybe like " 3Fusion " and the motto " Synthesis of Dragontail's Lair dbeckett.co.uk Black Ghost Studios " or something like that. Go to our current forum mentioned by Beckett below and post ideas. I also think if we combine the news/improvements/general talk section of all three sites into each main section, so instead of 3 news, 3 general talk, etc, we have 1 news, 1 general talk, etc and each section is for all 3 sites then we can get more posts in each section, thus making it more busy than each seperate one. Get me? Anyways, the forum needs to be split into boards and sub-boards like the following:    News ->  Whats new?, Future updates  General ->  General chat, Flameyard (ie spam can, no rulez), Recycle Bin (ie, all moved topics gets put into here temporarily)  3Fusion chat&nbsp;->  Suggestions 'n' Comments, Content&nbsp;(talk about content, ie flash, games etc), Affiliation (sorta like where ppl post to affiliate)  What do yers think? Anyway, I'll email fish now for the forum and the extra webspace in a new account for "bgs" with a password which i will send to you via email. I'll ask for 200MB (which is well enough, considering an avg flash anim is around 1-2MB, thats like 200/10 anims), and I'll pay him a fiver for that and the new forum, if he is a bit unhappy. Unless you are&nbsp;all meanies, everyone pays a measily&nbsp;50p and I'll pay Â£3.50, in the senario. actaully, I'll email him when I get back. Easier.

               Next Wednesday eh?    I will have to cut my movie short, but okay, I've done it in the form of Kill Bill, which means chapters, which means everything is fairly short and compartmented, so it won't be all that difficult for me to finish for next Wednesday, can't promise anything all that long though, its sort of a prelude, I still need to think up a proper storyline for the main thing, :/     &nbsp;   final verdict: deadline is no problem for me    Just don't expect uber.swf that's all     Over and out     James,     urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      Sorry my friends, I will defianately not get my flash finished by then. Seeing that its somthing like 2 minutes, most of it which is total co-ordinated sword fighting. I want something to be quality, not a rushed piece of crap. As you can see, I haven't been&nbsp;on the net&nbsp;recenty due to the fact I didnt have time, having a job, then the CDRW drivers failing and crashing as I watched The Matrix: Reloaded in the drive, and then to find out the flopply drive had done a kari-kari and died on me, randomly. So I had to get a new floppy,&nbsp;try to fix the problem unsucessfully with the CDRW, etc etc. I wont be on the next few days either as I have to work out&nbsp;the optimum&nbsp;method of networking my dads 30+ pcs which includes PIII500s, P4 1.4s, P4 1.7s, 2.4, 2.8, and many more, some on linux (different versions), some on windows 2k, some on XP!!!And then I have to build my dads new PC when it comes,&nbsp;which is good :) At the moment,&nbsp;the deadline is far too unreasonable for me, sorry folks, though if you really want, I'll send you what I have. I want it to be good, and I do not want any work rushed to achieve the deadline, though I do admit it is not a bad idea. I'm glad Beckett did this to motive the team.

      This is a warning issued to all sufferers of Shecklerscholosis. Do NOT expose yourself to the face of Tony Blair, even on television, as it may trigger a very bad reaction. *Cue dead ringers music*  Right...deadline...I'm working on my flash, Wanderers, Episode 1. Finished the first half of it, which is nothing but music, movement and random talk. But the latter half is full of fighting. Rhue against four Lyn...who will win? Well...programming the fighting's gonna be hard...so many sound effects to add in as well as blood splatter. Meh...but if I can't get it done, well, my article will have to do.

      Currently having a homemade milkshilk made by me, pretty good considering i have never made one before and no1 told me how to plus i had 2 stir the icecream for ages by hand to make it soft and turn it into chocolate flavour... really nice   Now done to work we need content, the only way this can go wrong is if nobody make anything and there aint&nbsp;any comunication.&nbsp;I think we should set a deadline that everyone has to submit a good piece of work, eg around next tuesday so we can get content and start to get hits and have something to talk about. so what do you think everyone has to submit a piece of work article/flash between monday and thursday plus it will make me actually start about making flash, couldnt be bothered at sec   Done no work today cuase went to see spiderman2 during afternoon and evening was installing new wireless phones that my dad had just bought and was watching tv.   James design doesnt suit the site enough ok i can see youve spent alot of time at it but you dont want the navigation to stand out and using flash makes things stand out, plus the current&nbsp;navigation is better, its&nbsp;a bit smaller and in your one&nbsp;clicking for the navigatin to appear isnt very proffessional, i like it the way it is small, simple, easily fixed and quick to download      Beckett   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

Its good that you like the design.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I never knew if you wanted your blog pic on the site, you know your actual pic, do you???  just&nbsp;incase you dont want it on&nbsp;i put a random pic in.  &nbsp;  There aint enough content so i dont want people to go to&nbsp;the site yet so i&nbsp;put the logo in and done under construction to make them think you cant view the site yet, gonna take all that page out when i get a bit more content and everything working.  &nbsp;  Can we also get a proper logo for the site, that we can put on all our presentations cause i need to change all my good flash to bg studios.  &nbsp; If you want to add content to the staff site i.e comment or any other page then send an email to me  urlLink davidc_beckett@hotmail.com &nbsp; &nbsp;  thanks,  p.s if you havent noticed i put capital letters in (just to please han)      Beckett   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

Ummm, you guys left out the apostrophe in " we've " on the front page, just point out that spelling mistakes look pretty random...  WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THE PICTURE OF A SURFER? (self explanatory really)  The logo at the start looks random, just a thought...  Can we please remove the "Site under construction" banner thingy? Since I'm&nbsp;thinking the site will always be under construction as we're adding things to it...   I know that was quite a few points, but just some stuff for our "Glorious Leader" to consider in his free time...

      I can almost say  urlLink www.blackghoststudios.tk  is finished! Me and Beckett (mainly Beckett) have worked on it for a long afternoon and evening, and its looking pretty l33t! All credit goes to Beckett who adapted the layout, and design most of the site, while I suggested this and that, and did some of the table layouts.  &nbsp;  Everybody is working:    Jamie - Working on the site, pages, and&nbsp;ads&nbsp;and his Flash movie evil.swf (not the final name, btw)  Beckett - Working on the site, pages, logos, layout... etc (a lot of work here)  Han - working on his articles, and his Flash animation, still unnamed right now, though its suppose to be a sprite animation  James - Not sure, but think he is working on his Flash animation, a parody of Kill Bill?

As for articles...they've been put on a temporary halt as I did my first flash, but now that that's done, I'm back on track. I've decided to put 20 points in the Too much C'n'C one, so not much left to do.&nbsp; Random Thoughts...need two more thoughts to write about before that's finished. &nbsp; So I end this blog post thingie with a quote from...Wilde. &nbsp; "America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between." -Oscar Wilde.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lovely quote describing one of my favourite countries, America. *Retches* &nbsp; Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      My dad ordered all his stuff today, for you who don't know, he had Â£2000 [up from 1500 I said before] to spend on various stuff.&nbsp;He let me decide what to order. I&nbsp;may have posted before what&nbsp;I  wanted  to order, but that has changed now,&nbsp;this is what he  has  ordered:  &nbsp;   (btw, if you don't understand, just ignore and move on:/)   &nbsp;     2x Opteron 242 1.6ghz 1MB cache 64bit  1x Dual Socket 940 MSI EXT-ATX motherboard  2x WD Raptor 36.7GB 10,000RPM&nbsp; SATA&nbsp; Hard drives  1x RAID controller  2x 1GB PC3200 ECC RAM (yes, 2GB of RAM, muwahaha)  1x Inwin 7010 tower case (very nice, has an intergrated fan controller)  1x 550W Meridian Power supply (uber power)  1x Samsung black DVD-ROM and Sony black Floppy  1x Gainward Geforce 6800 GT *Golden Sample* (pre-o/c, xtra cooling)  1x Microsoft wireless desktop set   Pretty good, no? Plus hes gonna use the 19" Sony TFT he had bought earlier. Ever better, is the fact that I get to swap my crappy Geforce4 Ti4600 with his Geforce6 6800GT! Thing is, I could have got a 6800 Ultra! It was only Â£20 more, so my dad agreed, but then I realized that my power supply&nbsp;only had&nbsp;1&nbsp;more molex connection free, while 2&nbsp;molex connections were&nbsp;needed by the 6800 ultra (a molex connection is the thing you power your optical drives/hard drvies with) 1 FÂ£%ing molex connection away from&nbsp;a 6800 ultra! Son of a b#$&amp;h!  otherwise, I'm getting a DAH-1000 512MB MP3 player:        and a Dita V3KC (Korean Curve) hockey stick:        Heheheheh, any time soon, I will buy. Kinda need to work on my Flash anim again.      Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      Whoever invited Beckett is indeed very smart. Good thinking :) Just a bit retarded for not doing it myself, lol. I changed the link, so Black Ghost Staff indeed goes to the new URL :) I'll alos work on a small logo hopefully less than 500k, to stick in front of projects, and such like. I also&nbsp;gave Beckett admin access like everyone else. I sent beckett an lengthy email describling several topics we were discussing, and everything looks well. So i'm happy :) &nbsp; Han's doing work on his articles, Becketts working on the site, I'm working on my flash, and james on his (which is quite a bonus) All I can say is good good good :) &nbsp; Hopefully something will become of this, but theres a 99% chance of everything becoming like Hiroshima '45, ie: everything F$%ked up. As long as people are prepared to work, I think It will become the 1% chance of a success. Maybe I should be less optimisitc and look at the defination of ghostanomics:  [2] miserable failure...      &nbsp;    Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      G'day to all you shecks out there. &nbsp; I'm taking up flash...but until I figure out how to even open the application,&nbsp;I shan't be contributing anything in  that  field. But onto the articles...two articles currently active. They are: &nbsp; 1. Random Thoughts, Collection 1 2. You know when you've played too much C'n'C &nbsp; Cheers to Jamie for the second one :). Now, down to discussion as to whether the things on Jamie's katana action thriller (j/k) are eggs or blobs. IMHO, eggs generally do not go around decapitating, dismembering and disembowling (my 3Ds) each other, unless they're in flash movies...on the other hand, blobs IMO don't have a regular shape, they resemble the things which inhabitate the bottom of a cesspit. So let's all just say that those 3D-ers are blobby eggs. &nbsp; ~Tull,   Black Ghost Studios staff

       Bleh...    &nbsp;  This is wingdings, try that for minimalist :P    &nbsp;  Props to you if you can read that without pasting it onto Word and changing the font to something normal...    &nbsp;  After an hour of work, I've got about 20 seconds of bugger all... that's the bad news, the good news is that I've got a storyline, and I can now work on it properly...    &nbsp;  Jamie is soooo lucky he can just do his randomly coloured background, I actually have to make my own in Photoshop, which can be a pain in the neck when the damn computer freezes every 2 seconds, even you open something like ****ing notepad...    &nbsp;  I'm moving into rant now aren't I...    &nbsp;  Btw Jamie, you can help me with this...

      Hmm, Blogger seemed to have updated the GUI once again. Now I don't need to look up the "img src =" for images HTML tag again, woohoo! Also, you can change font, but the funny thing is, the default font is Georgia which is my preferred font, so no changes there! I see James has changed to a smaller lighter font, being minimalist again >_>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Haven't got any Flash done today, just couldn't be&nbsp;bothered.&nbsp;I hear James is actually working on hid Flash project... That's good news, no?&nbsp;Note to James: They are NOT eggs! They are  blobs  :) Also noticed the gif image stretched out which screws up the layout. In the future, don't do that, notice that James. Thing is, although I have published the whole blog a million times over, I don't see the changes for at least an hour or two, unlike Life Eh? Which does it immediately :I've actually&nbsp;got 1700 frames in the Flash of the movie in the 1st scene. There will be 1 more full scene, and a credits scene and a preloader scene. I also have the basic storylines for the sequels, parts 2  and  3 of the Flash. Pretty l33t, huh?  &nbsp;  I'm also thinking for running a Invision board jacked up with some nice cosmetic hacks with Han&nbsp;admining it, running for&nbsp;3 sites, Black Ghost Studios [run by Beckett and me], Dragontail's Lair (Build II) [run by Han and me]&nbsp;and dbeckett.co.uk [run by Beckett]. At the moment I'm trying to persuade Fish aka Daniel to do it. He hasn't responded yet&nbsp;):/Once that happens, I'll try to get all 3 sites on a webring. Heheheh }:]  &nbsp;  Gotta make most of the l33t idea before Fish says no. Probably. Heh, must plead some more.      Jamie  ,   urlLink Black Ghost Staff

       Bleh...    Works begins on my idea of flash version of Kill Bill (I still have to name the movie, but plenty of time for that), or Jamie's gonna want my ass on a silver platter.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I&nbsp;currently face the problem of figures, I have a choice of stickmen or the eggs like in Jamie's katana dudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  2 problems, the stickmen will require a lot more work as their various body parts will have to move... Eggs have the opposite problem, they don't show enough movement, how the hell am I supposed to show a kick? Eggs going in with their bottoms???&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Bah...&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I'll try and get a trailer up soon for you to look over...&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  (Just so it'll look pr0, as Jamie likes to say)&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Over and out...     &nbsp;  James &nbsp;  urlLink  Black Ghost Staff

      Nothing really to contribute in this post, except to tie up some loose ends.  Preferably make the forums Invision, as I have the most (N.B. all) experience in it. I'll need some webspace allocated for Invision for custom skins and custom buttons(Reply, New Topic etc etc...)  Also, I've reached what is known as a "writer's block" for my articles. Absolutely no ideas...except for some articles including collections of random thoughts...which seem to allocate themselves the larger portion of my brain...ster-ange.  -Tull

      Worked on some Flash today. The result is 31.3 seconds of pure kantana action :) At 24 fps, this little flick is rocking, with kantanas, dai-kanatanas, throwing knifes, shrunkiens(might remove this later on), short swords and axes mixing with blood and little dudes. Theres like 24+ layers, so I had to switch resolution to 1280x1024 to get more stuff on screen. I will post a screenie later.   I wonder how Beckett is getting on with the site? Also, I have decided to have a full forum (invision prob), and I also putt Tull in charge. I also advice him to look at  urlLink this skin resource site . Its pretty l33t for Invision boards :) James better start to create some stuff in Flash, his wee exuse of no access resources is rubbish >:|  I produce 0% resource content Flash, with 100% of my own work, all drawn inside Flash.   Have to go to work tomorrow, must earn cash for l33t hockey stick and mp3 player.   Have fun the rest of you,   Jamie  ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      *Ahem* Under pressure from certain groups to make a post, I have put together a small and not so detailed message to add to this Black Ghost blog thing.  Testing...1...2...3  Right, the name "Blog" is about as random as this post is. The term, "Blog" generally makes me think of a mess, in particular mashed potatoes. This is *probably* what this blog is about, mashed potatoes, perhaps some of the games Black Ghost is making will include a mashed potatoe fight.  But I shall be writing articles, possibly reviews if James can get a decent flash game/movie up :P. Oh, and RPG designing, my specialty, ripping gfx from other games. Oh, and surfing the large large net for useful things to add to the site. Oh yeah, I'm the master of Invisionpower Board forums, giving me admin powers means you get the most out of your forum, trust me :D  "It is equally offensive to speed a guest who would like to stay and to detain one who is anxious to leave." -Homer.

      Long time no post :/ Mainly cos of Morrowind. Anyways, Beckett should be back soon and us two will try to work out a site for Black Ghost. I decided the blog can be related to anything, so it doesnt have to be with Black Ghost. Hopefully, that adds freedom :) Added Tull a long time ago, but he hasnt posted. His time is short. I mean it!  Dads got a Â£1500 to spend randomly on PCs. I have convinced him to spend it on a PC which I will build. Here are the the specs:  Pentium 4 3.2ghz | 1gb cosair PC4000 memory | 2 x 120gb Hard disks in RAID 0 | 875P Albatron motherboard >:) | geforce 6800 GT | 19" TFT Sharp  time to overclock it to 3.7ghz muwhahaha  Meanwhile must go back to messing around with Flash :)    Jamie  ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      Set up, well tried to set up Apache on my computer. It works, but there's a slight problem. My router seems to stop all incoming traffic, even though I open port 80, enable DMZ on my IP and disable the hardware SPI firewall. Meaning everyone part from me get a 404 error. Its enough to make me throw it out the window. I even registered http://dragontail.serverbox.org, which directs all traffic to my IP. Shame it all gets blocked though >:(  Me and Beckett have agreed to develop a template site for Black Ghost, while James is continuing to fiddle about with Flash trying to create his pr0 movie. Only problem is he is on a 56k, and hes never gonna get the right resources. Well, thats his excuse. Han is, well, not doing much. Great. I'm having some doubts to see what he is willing to produce. Better late than never I suppose.  I swear, this stupid router is gonna piss me off till I throw my ultra heavy goldfish bowl 17" monitor at it. What else can I do?

      Dear Lord, asked some friends if they wanted to join Black Ghost Studios, providing that *insert huge list of details here*, and so far a pretty +ve response. Quality, quality.  James is added as a member in this blog, but it will take him another couple of hours before he realises, cos he is kinda like 5+ hours behind the GMT time in Canada. Grrreat!  More later. Maybe.

      The 1st post is always the hardest one. It is my job to make it less hard for myself. First, you may be wondering: [side note:  you , like, someone else apart from me is readings this?]    what is the purpose of this blog?  The simple answer to that is to act as a jotpad for ideas and thoughts for the staff and friends of  Black Ghost Studios .   Erm, Black Ghost Studios?  Yeh, Black Ghost Studios is a Studio dedicated in indie development, by indie developers. It started as a hobby for me, and it still is. I have to wait and see how far the rest of my friends are willing to stay with  Black Ghost Studios .   Yeh whatever, you're just a bunch of losers!  Thanks, just read the meaning of Ghostanomics :)  James won't be the most happy man in the world when he sees this, but I promise to him this is just occasional postings, I will still post in  urlLink Life eh?  Meanwhile, to find out a little more, why not check out my  urlLink website ? View the forums, and you should see a new template for it. Should be cool B), see you there.

      Well, I done the logo. At 20fps, and 400x300 dimension, I think it came out pretty well. I really like the font, Can't remember what it is though :/ I gonna start the banner and then the ads plus the 88x31 buttons like the ones I'd done for DL. Wonder what name to use, BlackGhostStudios is kinda long... maybe just Black Ghost...  Well on another note, most of the components for the PC has arrived. Just the Gainward geforce 6800GT *Golden Sample* hasn't arrived yet. The manufacter don't know when they can get the board produced and sent to us, LOL cos its so rare. So, the ppl at XFX are ever better at selling rare graphics cards. The Geforce 6800 Ultra Ultimate Edition (LOL @ the name already) is so rare that potenial buyers must enter into a ballot to be drawn to even buy the card...  at an cost of $600  X-D     -=ROFLMAO=-  Only 100 cards have ever been sold. Its only ever faster than the normal 6800 ultra in extreme situations, like Far Cry 1600x1200, ultra high settings, 4x antialiasing 8x anistrophic filtering and Unreal II 3200x2400 (LOLOL @ that res) max details and 4XAA and 8x AF. But its $100 more expensive.  I also have a 486 chip and 16MB EDO memory stick in my bedroom randomly, and I compared it to the opteron 64 242 and a 1GB ECC DDR PC4000 stick. 10 years of technology side by side... Not much difference in terms of shape and colour and stuff...:/     Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff

      Again, everything seems to go very well so far for BGS. Beckett's being doing some good work on the site, while Han's working hard on his flash anims. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to finish my animation on time for the new deadline. However, the movie is still going very strong and I plan to finish it before August 20th. The temp. frums will have to do for the meantime, till we get our new invision one from ABP. One of the affiliates on the site should be BGS offical blog which would like to this! I also need to create a new 33x81 button for BGS and BGS Ofical Blog and some banners, plus a new logo :/ Hopefully, that will be soon. I will also create a new revision of BGS terms and conditions and a doc with Future Info as soon as I have free time. Otherwise, thats all from me right now.

      And Sheckloproduction has ground to a halt...  Right, I'll be releasing a screen of Episode 2 soon, as soon as i get all the graphics i'll be needing ripped.  *Bit about beckett deleted cause beckett didnt like it* - edited by beckett  Changed storyline of Episode 2, got a much better one. I'll just say that there'll be a 'duelling' battle, called the Plunge, where the two opponents run up to each other and jump up, and attack. There'll be blade arts possibly if I can be bothered to grab them, but you'll understand all. Red hair to all!  Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
