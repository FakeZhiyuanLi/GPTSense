      Funny thing.  I'm glad someone posted a comment actually asking on what my research is about.  I guess I have failed to talk a bout that since I started my blog.  My bad.  Let me tell ya.  The idea for my research came to me as I was leaving the airport on my way back from Seattle last April.  I decided I wanted to do some work based on the experiences of refugees based on the concept of diaspora.  At first, I was ready to go out there and interview everyone who has come to this country as a refugee in order to preserve their oral histories.  Then I realize how absurd that goal was considering that I only have an X amount of time to actually complete this research and have a thorough analysis of the cases studied.  So I had to narrow down and that was really hard.  I trully wanted to go out there and spend the rest of my time interviewing families and getting to hear all their stories.  So I decided to go by gender.  Females.  Then I decided Afghan women would be an excellent group to work with.  Then I spent a week in Indiana at a McNair Senior Conferences and ended up coming home with yet another change of heart.  Since I am a double major and I have an equal amount of love for both of the degrees I have been persuing (Spanish and Multi Ethnic Studies), I decided that it would fit both categories if I worked on the experiences of Cuban refugees in Idaho, more specifically in Boise.  For example, I'm curious to know why they have resettle in this area of the country as oppose to an are such as Florida or New York where there are thousands of 'compatriotas'.  Now, I have been refining that even further into what exaclty is that i want to get from this.  This is what I got so far: As a two part project I have set up to go on with the recording of the oral histories, I am getting ready to lear how to transcribe them so that I have a solid data base to base my reasearch on.  I want to explore the causes and consequences of resettlement and the effects that this has in these people's lifes.  I also want to go into the politic aspect of it and find out more about the role that both the government of the U.S and Cuba play in these people's life's decitions.  Or something like that.  So, at a huge glance, there you have it.

      Last night a couple of amazing things happened to me.  I was sitting at home, actually working on yesterday's post when my hubby showed up.  He said we should go pick up a video we had lend to our friend Rifka so as we walked out he suggest that I drove.  I went back inside the house to get my keys and wallet and as I turned around the corner to get into our bit up 1991 Geo Storm when... BEWARE AND BEHOLD!!!!! He had gone out behind my back and bought a PT Cruiser for my birthday!!!  It is sooooo beautiful!! It is a 2001 Limited Edition with niiiice leather interiors and keyless entry and it has a cd changer in it... I feel like a spoiled brat (I know I am), but this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.  So, needless to say my feet have been several inches off the ground due to my absolute disbelief that this is our new car!  Ok, enough about that, what it's really touching and really relevant to everyone else, is that last night we went and saw Farenheit 9/11 at the Flicks.  I really wasn't prepared by any means to come face to face with the reality of war as described by Michael Moore.  And even less by the reality of what this government is doing behind everyone's back.  I felt good and bad because even though as I left the theater I had learned so much, I can't forgive myself for having lived in such obliviousness through the 4 years of the reign of terror that has been Bush's presidency.  There is only one thing to say to all of this: this man (if you can call it that) cannot, be re-elected.  I feel I need to go bang on the INS's door and demand a citizenship just so I can go out and vote in November.  This country can't afford another year with this government. Is just not right. It hasn't been from day one, but it is still salvagable.  I guess I'm just in awe of how ignorant the general public truly is about what goes on at the higher levels of the government.  It makes sense that they keep us so busy looking at add and getting us to buy everything under the sun or keep us petrified with their ups and downs in the country's security levels.  By the way, yes, I did feel like an ass getting into our new car and driving home after such a compelling documentary.   I'm at a loss of words.

      So... here I am.  After reading most of Marcy's and Echo's postings of their intrepid adventures in Egypt I couldn't help but to want my very own blog.  Now, I am not off into any adventure this summer, so it took me about three weeks to figure out why exactly I needed to have this blog.  I have been, however, quite busy trying to put together a research project that has taken a huge amount of my energy in the past 5 weeks and it is a totally new experience for me.  So I decided, why not a blog where I can rant on about my frustrations and gains through the process of researching, or better yet, learning to reseach? And so, I figure I can justify my very own blog in the fact that I am going to drive myself crazy unless I have an outlet to vent out while working on this project.  Plus, I figure if I rant long enough about something, maybe some really break through ideas for the project may come to mind.  That would be awesome. As of yesterday, I felt as if I had already lost the battle with research before it had even begun.  I had been fairly warned that while doing research some of the most common feelings would be dispair and frustration.  I guess people can pre warn you all they want, but it really doesn't mean anything until you truly experience it on your own shoes.  So it hit m about a week ago and I was ready to quit when David Hall called up a "cohort meeting" of sorts to have everyone who was interested in sharing their own experiences come up and speak up their minds.  A total of four of us showed up and as soon as everybody else started speaking I realize that I was by no means the only person feeling at an absolute loss.  In fact (not that this is a good thing), there were a couple people that were almost worst off than I was!! So, I left the meeting feeling MUCH better and that was followed up by yet another great meeting with my mentors today. This is why I decided today would be a good day to start up a blog.

      What is it about people that they always think to fix your life before they can start contemplaiting their own?  I am writing while I'm still very upset over an email from a long time "friend" of my husband's who I inherited through him as well.  This "friend" of ours has been sending us over the summer series of emails on various topics including how Zack and mine married relationship sucks (this is possibly why we are so unhappy we've been together very happily for almost 9 years!), how we are shallow, unimotional and unspiritual people or how my husband is heavily influenced by me (which is funny considering that one of my biggest prides is that I rejoyce in the influence that my husband has in my life), and that this is why he will always fail at what he's [my husband] doing.  In the latest email he calls Zack's father and myself overbearing.  Zack's father doesn't even live in the same continent as us and this "friend" of ours hasn't seen him in the last 5 years or so. And yes, I can be overbearing, specially when I'm being told how to live and how to think and told even how to cook in my own house by someone who has no right to do so.  I can get overbearing and defensive just as anybody else would under those circumstances. He suggests that Zack needs to get away from us and leave with him and go to the mountains just like they used to.  I detect a bit of insanity here.  Most people don't understand the meaning of growing up and growing appart.  I think it has happened to all of us that while in this transition of 'growing up' (if there's such a thing) we loose people that we considered to be the greatest of friends.  I lost several "best friends" from high school just because we didn't see each other eye to eye in many, many issues, but we didn't send each other nasty emails, we didn't even get mad.  We simply acknowledged the fact that our lifes had become very different and moved on.  I still keep in touch with the majority of them, but no longer at a deep level like we used to.  And that is perfectly ok.  I feel angry, frustrated and very dissapointed with this person.  I can't speak on behalf of my husband, but I know he's at the end of his rope too.  We have choosen to not even respond to our "friend's" allegations because every time we see his name on our email all we can do is hold on tight as we read the series of negative, borderline insanely hurtful comments that follow, and the worst part is that, no matter how hard I've tried to look at this 'negative reinforcement' under a positive light, I can't find reasons to justify continuing a friendship with someone who uses you (us) as his scapegoat for all his frustrations, failures and sources of anger.  The part that always gets me is how the emails end in a: You guys know I love you like family...

      In order to get my research on its way I need to go through an IRB evaluation. What is IRB you may wonder? Well, IRB is the Institutional Review Board, the people in charged of making sure you are not going to harm amyone while carrying on your research. I have been working along my mentor(s) for the last few weeks getting this IRB package put together and I think I finally got it to a point to where it looks good enough for them (IRB) to eat.  So, now comes the fun part. Well almost. I still need to get through the lit review and then I get to start doing interviews. I'm really excited about that. I'm not exactly sure how it all will pan out, but I'm sure it will be an amazing experience anyway.

      Today, I am writting from Coeur d' Alene.  I am up here for a  friend's wedding with my friend Christy.  Last night while talking  to Taylor who is the son of the lady that very gracefuly offered to  host us while in town, the topic of white supremacy came up.   Today, the Arian Nations were holding their annual White Power parade  in downtown.  Needless to say I headed that way this morning to  participate in history in the making.  I had mental images of KKK  hodded people and imagined hundreds of hateful people parading through  the streets of this beautiful city.  I feared for my safety, but  my curiosity was bigger than my fears.  As we arrived there, there  were dozens of police officers and both of the main streets were  blocked off to trafic.  We stood a block away from where they were  marching and saw all 20 members of the Arian Nations congregation, most  of which are well beyond 65 years of age ridicule themselves in front  of dozens of very angry citizens protesting their mere presence.   Up on an old bit up white truck, was Richard Buttler himself, equiped  with wheel chair and oxygen tank.   Every time they chanted  "White Power!" the general public response was, "Shut up and GO  HOOOME!!"  This is one of the most incredible displays I've seen  in my life.  Across the street from where we were standing, there  where at least three dozen riot police officers in full gear awaiting  further instructions.  They took over the whole street and  proceded to load up into unmarked white cars that where lined up, four  policemen and policewomen per car plus two suburbans with officers  hanging in both sides of the cars.  There were also an Explosive  Disarming Unit and an Emergency Response vehicle along side fire trucks  with their hosses set to disperse any riot that may break out.  I  was a witness to all this on July 17, 2004.

      Sunday my husband and I went to see Farenheit 9/11 for the second time with 4 family members who had not seen it yet.  I thought for sure that the second time around this would be an easier film to watch, but boy, was I wrong! Afterwards we went down to the Flying M and sipped on cold coffee and discussed pur feelings about it for a couple of hours.  Now, for those of you who know Zack, you know him as a very quiet, borderline shy person who only speaks when something is truly important is to be said.  Well, he has started speaking and nodoby is going to be able to stop him now.  Zack works in a place where everyone around him owns at least a gun, very conservative, Bush supporter, Christians.  He is a sort of odd-duck but has always been treated with lots of respect and his views have always been inf anything, tolerated.  On Sunday, he brought up the fact that he really wanted to put up money for people where he works to pay for the ticket to go see the film.  Today this is the email he sent out:     "To each person at -------, I am personally putting up $20 of my own money for you to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 - no strings attached.  All I ask is that you watch it with an open heart and mind, preferably with your families, from beginning to end.  I strongly believe that this is one of the most important films of our lifetime, and each of us as American citizens owes it to ourselves and our families to at least watch it all the way through.    If you think that you already know what this film is about (2 hours of Bush-bashing propaganda and Michael Moore preaching lies to you about how awful America is) then that's all the more reason you should go watch it.    I'm the type of person that is not easily fooled or swayed by clever editing, especially knowing how easy it is to skew perception in one's favor by splicing speeches and only portraying one side of an issue.  With such close scrutiny on Michael Moore these days, I walked into Fahrenheit 9/11 with a lot of skepticism, and as I was watching it, tried to separate each video clip from the film and place it back into the context from which it was taken, hoping to get the most honest, unbiased view of each person represented.  Even despite the parts I disagreed with, this film left me shocked, saddened, and outraged at at what is going on in our country right under our noses.  There are numerous honest, real, uncut interviews and sections of press footage that simply cannot be ignored.    Please see this film in the theaters.  Don't wait until it comes to home video.  It's playing at The Flicks downtown or Edward's at these show-times:[attachment here].   Matinee prices are about $5.50 if you go before 5:15pm (weekdays or weekends).  Even if you get nothing else from it, at the very least I'll make it free for you, plus $12-$15 in your pocket for at least giving it a try.  Zachary Black  The only thing I edited out of this email was the location of his workplace for privacy.  So far, his boss compromised to go watch it and will also take his family along...
