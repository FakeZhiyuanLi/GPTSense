      I was watching Four Corners last night.  They featured a story about Australia's growing reliance on credit to keep our dreams alive.  It told a familiar tale of our seldom satisfied fast food appetites and our card swiping hunger for instant gratification.  It included a case study which cited the financial concerns of a newly married Sydney couple - he in advertising, she in advertising - between them an income of about 300 thousand dollars a year.    They were speculating on the merits of buying their third or fourth property and spoke in a kind of glossy ad speak which was never intended to sound nauseating, but soon stimulated my bile duct to such an extent, I started having evil thoughts about them.  Did I really want these young and articulate Australians to lose their jobs and their houses and their Porsche and the standard of living to which they'd become so accustomed?  You bet I did.  Did I really want to smudge Bram's buffed and polished metrosexual complexion with the foul smelling grit of real life?  You bet I did.  I didn't want real harm to befall him, just a hilarious roller skating accident which would end in a dumpster, knock out a few perfect teeth and give him years of Wednedsay afternoon appointments with one of Sydney's leading speech therapists, when he might otherwise be sealing important deals or have a bodywax.  His partner, can't remember her name - was a little more modest, but just as hungry to leave the rest of us behind and secure her future with as much dosh as she could muster from the property market.    What the hell is she trying to escape from, I wondered?  What two headed, club footed suburban nightmare does she think is trying to grab her and stuff her into its dark, foul smelling maw?  It's a stupid question, but I like the vivid imagery.  Anyway, I sought no great retribution for her, perhaps just a small reality check.  Maybe steal the espresso machine and force her to drink Pablo instant coffee.  Why so antagonistic?  Well the programme also featured other case studies - people with real problems.    One mother told a story of having spent ridiculously beyond her means - and gone bankrupt.  Her children now live with her ex-husband.  It was a sorry tale of misguided expectation, but she had been enlightened by the experience. How?  Because it made her stop and reassess - and regain a little perspective; spend time with the kids, and learn, however painfully that the endless need to consume and spend, certainly hadn't brought her closer to some kind of peace or fulfillment.    That's come now she's broke.  Another elderly Melbourne woman had fallen for the glossy good news of a shonky financial advicer, who devised a brilliant scheme by which she could borrow more and more and lose more and more, while feeding a growing gambling addiction.    She was trying very hard to get her life back on the rails; hoped she wouldn't have to lose the townhouse she'd bought with money inherited from her recently dead mother and appeared on the show, to warn others about the terrible mess she'd got herself into and from which, she is now desperately, trying to extricate herself.  Both these women had made mistakes, but both were determinedly accountable for them.    What was so compelling about these Australian case studies that I should feel the need to write about them?  Well the last two women had nothing but had learnt a lot - our newlyweds had everything - and just seemed to want more.  I know who I'd want as neighbours.  Unless of course Bram would lend me the Porsche...

      The United Nations, human rights groups and churches have again condemned Australia's enthusiasm for locking up kids in detention centres.  Why?  Because they know it's just wrong - it's cruel and it's morally indefencible.    But here comes Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone, her giant blousy spinnaker full of spite and powered by the hot winds of Howard's hate - warning that should those kids be set free, it would be a signal to refugee smugglers that it's once again okay to tie yourself to an esky lid and try to get to Australia.  Yes citizens, the filthy hoards from God Knows Where will be onto us like a fly on a turd if we go easy on the little buggers now.    Clearly, we'd be bloody stupid to unpick their stitched lips or reunite them with families or let them go to real schools beyond that high wire fence.  Tell me Amanda Vanstone, what motivates you to peddle the politics of fear this way?  How satisfying is it to gorge youself on such cheap opportunism?   Will it win you respect around the cabinet table?  Will those thin lipped bloodless men respect you any more? Will John Anderson slip a hand down that elasticised waistband?  I think not, you'll always be Fat Mandy to them.  And when you wake up in the middle of the night, with a savage pain in your chest, I wonder if you'll recognise the ache of regret - was it that second helping of cheesecake - or was it your soul fleeing an empty space.

      I needed the fresh air, so I jumped off the couch, called behind me to the kids and then made for the front door and the park.  I sprinted ahead...well, perhaps walked, but my arms pumped vigorously enough for me to give the impression of being purposeful.  In my careful grip, the kid's footy, a three quarter size Sherrin - and holding it laces down, I decided to send it ninety metres into the middle of the oval.  As I dropped it onto my right foot, I felt fifteen again - ludicrously loose limbed and ferociously strong.  I never did get to see how far the footy flew, because I felt, no, I even heard, my thigh muscle peel away from the bone of my leg like a fat fish being expertly filleted.  I crumpled to the ground while onlookers on the grassy knoll searched for my assasin.  When my kids were smaller, they would have wept with panic at the sight of their big brave dad looking so broken and humbled - now they just laughed and ran off with their Mum to get the ball, which had landed next to a tree about 15 metres away.  I had nothing to say to them - they didn't really know what to say to me, so I hobbled home, lay on the couch in my undies, tried to apply ice to the affected area, which from what I could tell was everywhere - both legs, bum, left ear etc and got up only to have a weak vomit in the loo.  It was humiliating.  In the space of fifteen foolish minutes I'd become victimised, undermined, patronised and ridiculed by everyone and everything, everywhere.  And at the age of 41, that's a lonely place to be on a wet afternoon in Swinging Burwood.

      IT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH - a good hard look through the crosshairs of truth, where we hope to finally get a few bloody answers and some long overdue accountability back on this country's agenda.  We've had a gutful of the litany of lies and deception, the abuse of common decency, the brazen, broken promises, the hijacking of moral decency and the rorts and rip offs which are turning good people - decent people like you and me into knots of high pressure, road raging...  "Shut up kids or you'll get a backhander" tension.  And there's no doubt about whose fault it is - and I think it's just about time to point a well aimed digit in the direction of those who are to blame and must be made to pay.  Why should we, the silent majority put up with it - as they laud it over us and shove it in our faces, knowing we're too polite to do a bloody thing about it.  Well they can go to buggery, because it's time to fire an arrow of accountability and a round of reality into their hot air balloon of bullshit.  So just who are they?  Who's behind this?  I'll tell you who's cooked up this stew of disgust, who's gorged themselves in this sewer of filth.  Come closer and I'll tell you.  THEY have!  That's who - THEM!    It's their fault and I think you know who we're talking about - those who aren't like you and me, who aren't US.   Who are they?  Oh yeh, as if we didn't know.  Did they think we were bloody born yesterday - that we came down in the last shower, that we still wet the bed?  Who are they?  The funny looking ones of course - HIM! HER! LOOK OUT! THEM OVER THERE!  Look at them, trying to fit in - trying to be just like us.  Well it won't work, because I can spot 'em a mile off and they're a dead give away every time.  Look out the window – see that bloke who just moved in next door.  Oh he’s good, startin’ up the mower and having a go at the nature strip, like he’s one of us….  PISS OFF MATEY, we don’t need your type here.  Yeh, let's name them, expose them, remind them with a few well chosen words or a clip under the ear, when they're not looking or are carrying bags of groceries - that we know what they're about - we can see exactly what they're trying to do and they don't have a HOPE IN HELL of getting away with it.  Yes readers, now it's our turn.  We've had a gutful.  We're fed up to dolly's wax and our message to them - YES YOU MATEY - (I saw the sly look, the furtive glance, that sad doe eyed, what me, what have I done expression....)    We're a wake up to it all and let me tell you -  IT’S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  There, I think I've made the point.

      And so John Howard thinks our primary school kiddies should spend less time playing marbles and more time, gazing in awe at a proud Australian flag blowing in the breeze.    Now - such ideas are drearily familiar and will no doubt be applauded by those who think we'd be far better off if we were more like Americans - whereby we could blindly, blandly cheer our righteous goodness as if it was a virtue owned by us alone.    And of course we could watch out for those who who might glance or sneer at the flag or not look at all and have them sent to the principal. He would then hand out detention or send the treacherous nippers to Woomera.   And to make it even more insidious; downright creepy even is that Mr Howard has said that schools which do not fly the flag will not receive their share of federal education funding.  What a nasty piece of work he is.  Behind that blank Rotary Club President expression lies an absolute schemer - a blamer, a dobber and now the offerer of sly bribes.  Thank God for cartoonists like Bill Leak in the Australian (June 28) who can expose such cynicism.  He has portrayed a gruesome near nude foursome of Ruddock, Costello, Howard and a typically fishnetted Downer, clutching a bath towel size Australian flag around them.  As a red faced Howard explains "It's our last refuge."  Indeed it is - the fucking scoundrel.  Talk about dishonouring one's country...
