      Last night I saw the big controversial movie: Fahrenheit 9/11.  While being anti-war I am really happy that this movie came out.  People really deserve to know the full truth about wars in general: bombs kill everyone indiscriminatively, people come back missing limbs and other gruesome stuff.  That's the stuff the army recruiter will never tell you about.  One of the issues with this movie is that the message is so one sided that it definitely sickens anyone with half a brain.  Can you claim sophisticated audience with a sane perspective w/o loosing the "simple folks"?  This calls for a multi layered masterpiece and that seems to be beyond Michael Moore's capabilities.  A good review can be found on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/.  -mb  PS: everyone should see this movie :)

      Happiness is the perception of progress towards one's goals.

      How do you properly set the expectations in your life.&nbsp; Expectations make you work really hard.&nbsp; If you are expected to set high goals and meet them you are almost guaranteed to achieve more then the person who doesn't have any expectations for themselves.&nbsp; At the same time setting expectations can greatly disappoint you when you don't meet them.&nbsp; Thinking about that I came up with a rule of thumb about the expectations:&nbsp; set expectations only when you can do something about them.&nbsp; If you set expectations that are dependant mostly on other people you are betting your happiness on a roll of dice.

       urlLink A  yahoo story   "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A confidant of Osama bin Laden, seen on a videotape with the al-Qaida chief as he talked about the Sept. 11 terror attacks, surrendered to Saudi diplomats in Iran and was flown to the kingdom Tuesda"  So now I am curious about what's looming on the horizon.  Could it be that bin Laden is going to miraculously appear right before the election?  What a great way to seal the deal!  Notice that we have already gotten over the economic recovery and we have already gotten over the capture of Saddam.  Is Bush timing the capture of Osama... :)?

      We are getting to the point where pollution can be detected by satellite.  We might be no longer in the situation where no one knows "whodunit".  From the article in  urlLink Seattle Times    "Most of the pollution in downtown Seattle today is our own, don't forget that," says Dan Jaffe, a Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Washington's Bothell campus. "But what the pollution from Asia does is add to the background levels, and a few days a year, these pollution levels can be high enough to push us up over the EPA's ozone limit."  This could have an interesting implication for international politics.  After we have started a war based, in part, on satellite images of chemical bases can we start a war because some rogue nation is polluting the earth?

      An article on News.com: IRS eyes Net phone taxes  What's new:  The IRS and the Treasury Department have suggested that an existing federal excise tax on phone calls should be interpreted to apply to Internet telephone calls.  Bottom line:  The move promises to roil the fast-growing VoIP industry and follows similar attempts by state officials to tax or regulate Net telephony.  I've been thinking about taxes and the government and decided to approach the problem from a different perspective.  Is taxing a RIGHT or a PRIVILIGE?  Really, does "the government" have a right to tax us whenever they please, or is it something that we should have a say in? Can someone come back and tell the government: "I evaluated the deal that you have offered me and I don't like it. I wish to withdraw from your protection for my company in this aspect and not pay this particular tax".  Why are we so used to just accepting whatever the government decides to do?

      Yet again these guys are trying to regulate something that they have absolutely no idea about.  This time they are trying to limit the shipments of all PCs with Intel processor above the power of pentium 3 outside the US.  They claim that it's too much computing power and it can be used in military purposes.  So what are the outcomes of such legislation?  1 - the bad guys who want to buy those computers get them anyway because they can afford it 2 - US based companies loose market share because someone out there is going to clone the CPUs and sell them to the people who want them.  From CNet's article: http://news.com.com/Defense+bill+could+stifle+computer+trade/2100-7341_3-5253873.html?tag=nefd.lede  Seymore Goodman, professor of International Affairs and Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the author of two policy papers used by the Clinton administration on the issue, stressed the impossibility of restricting computers that no longer require entire rooms to house them. Now smuggling a few more computer chips to expand a cluster is easy, he said.  "If this gets through Congress, it is a regression of mind-boggling proportions," Goodman said. "You cannot control anything that is made by the millions and which you can put in your pocket."
