      Another minister at our church asked me a question last week that I thought was insightful...  He referred to the story in John 9 where Jesus' followers asked him about a man born blind, and whose sin caused that ailment, the man's or his parent's.  The question was, is being blind inherently a bad thing?  We realized that the question that was asked of Jesus, "Whose sin caused this," assumed that blindness was a bad thing or a punishment that would be the result of sin.  Jesus' answer is great..."It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him be blind. This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him."  I would like to see my weaknesses, as well as those of people around me, as opportunities for God's power to be shown...not just as weaknesses for us to hide or work around...

      I love my junior high kids...yesterday we had our first Jr. High only class since I've been working at this church (after two Sundays of cancelled classes because a total of 1 student showed up in two weeks.)  I had a great class planned with group activities and fun stuff, and while we were reading the announcement sheet, we found the verse of the day from Ephesians 6.  When I asked a student to read that for us, he couldn't find it, and then we realized that nobody in the class knew how to find Ephesians.  So...we spent the whole day doing a quick lesson on the NT books and where they came from!  I loved it because they were totally into the lesson, asking questions about it, and seriously interested in where this stuff came from.  I'm really excited to see this hunger in them...may it be an indicator of things to come in the Jr. High group...

      Is anyone reading this?  If so, post a comment!  Fished with grandparents today, as well as just hang out time.  Great to be here with them.  Fish were biting, and we caught quite a few of them, but they were all throw backs for being too small.  Went and ate fish at the world-famous King's Inn though, so that made up for it.  Will travel back tomorrow night.

      Arrived in Kingsville tonight to see grandparents.  Saw 3 nice bucks on the way up here...all 8 points between Hwy. 35 and Refugio.  Nice to be away from town for a while.  Will probably get to drive on the King Ranch in the next 48 hours, one of my favorite past times.  Also should get to fish...What more could I ask for?  Had a great Bible study today with the high school kids after school.  Focused on anger and how Jesus was able to remain unangry during very frustrating times (betrayal by Judas, disciples who wouldn't stay awake for prayer).  Hope it was helpful to the kids.  Till later...

      Frustration today...  When I moved to this city to work with this church, there were 7 or 8 families whose main bread-winner was out of work due to layoffs and downsizing.  This week, the last one is expected to get a new job.  Then today, I got an e-mail from one of the guys who was out of work, and then found work a few months ago.  Turns out his job's not gonna last.  His e-mail to me includes this...   I just don't understand. I have been acting in faith and done what I believe God wanted me to do. Yet my employment situation hasn't stabilized yet. I feel betrayed and let down. Why can't God see that I am trying my best to His will? Why do I have to start yet again and go through the uncertainty and fear again. I am trying to believe that God is working to make the situation that He wants me to be in, but I have now gone through 5 jobs in 3 years. Just as soon as we get financially stabile and can begin to work towards some feeling of security, God pulls the rug out from under me again. I don't believe that I have the problem of identifying my self worth by my job. I simply want to be able to support my family and hopefully help some other people as well. Is that so wrong? What lesson have I not learned that God is continueing to prune my life? What fruit does he want me to bear that I'm not bearing?  I know that we should rejoice in our difficulties since that means that we are sharing in the suffering of Christ. Yet I cannot help but feel that, well, I'm being picked on. I don't know any other way to say it. I feel angry, then numb, then angry again. I'm trying to remind my self that Job and the Psalmists railed against God and He accepted their honesty, but I still feel guilty that I'm complaining about how God is treating me.  I feel like I give and I give and I give, and this is the thanks I have from God for it. My wife and I were both blessed with servant hearts, and so it really does come natural to spend so much time serving. It is God that has done that, and used us as his tool. So why can't He take better care of His tools?     I hate hearing a brother struggling...and yet I love to hear his honesty.  Thank you friend. Thank you Lord...

      So, the camping trip was much more exciting than I had anticipated.  I was afraid it was gonna be another of those activities that was not real enjoyable since I'm the resident single guy and wouldn't be there with any family.  Good times had by all...highlight was when we were all around a table playing Nertz and looked into the woods to see a 7 year old from our group tossing a 3 foot snake into the air.  After we all rushed to save him from the snake that surely would have bitten him except that it was in the process of shedding its skin, he showed us the ziplock bag he had that contained a live Black-widow spider!  That was awesome.  That boy has about 30 guardian angels on full alert.  Learned how to make a pen today out of a raw piece of wood.  Went to a guy's house from our church and he helped me make a beautiful writing pen on a lathe.  Turned out really good, I thought.  Then he said, "Yeah, my first one wasn't all that good either..."  Guess I can only go up from there.

      Things around here haven't been too exciting, although days in Alvin rarely are.  I am leaving this weekend for a short Church-family camping trip close to Lake Livingston.  I'm gonna try to bring the kayak and get out on the lake for a little while.  I had hoped that Monday I'd be able to go to Metro, the huge Houston Area College Age Worship time at First Baptist, Houston, but alas, I have a youth group activitiy scheduled that will keep me from it.  The one bye week of our softball season, and I can't go to Metro cause of my own scheduling mess-up...Ahh, the joys of responsibility...

      I can remember times in my spiritual walk when being involved in clubs, organizations, or even businesses that said "Christian" on the label was an exciting thing.  I think that's because the Christian life can seem so lonely at times, and because standing up for the right thing as much as you can frequently leaves you feeling alone.  Because of all that, I think many times Christians search for a way to be associated with other Christians.  Certainly I can still feel that as I long for association with the other youth ministers in the Houston area and count the days each month till our monthly meetings for prayer, food, and basketball.  I need that time.  I am feeling strongly though, that the mature Christian's attitude becomes much more excited by opportunities to be exposed and even persecuted by non-Christians.  This certainly must have a lot to do with the apparent "spiritual self-sufficiency" that develops in a mature Christian, that is actually a result of the increased awareness and dependence on the sufficiency of Jesus.  I long to be a person who depends on Jesus to be sufficient, not just to redeem my sin, but to be my provision.  Of course, in my current life-stage and situation, the constant measure of how I'm doing depending on God is how well I'm doing in my level of loneliness.  I find myself begging God to see fit to provide me with local friends and a wife so that I can have someone to share my life with, and yet I also find myself singing to him enthusiastically the Chris Tomlin lyrics, 	"All of you is more than enough for all of me 	 For Every Thirst and Every Need 	 You satisfy me with your love 	 And all I have is more than enough" I hope that my spirit can make that testimony.  Currently my heart believes and feels that, but if I'm not thinking about it, I fall into the default mode of "NEEDING" more things from God.  I don't NEED anything more than what I already have.  And I want that to be my testimony.

      Wow...After three days of attempting to post the first blog entry, it finally worked.  Hope I'm not that bloggaly challenged all the time.  Friday I had to laugh.  As a youth minister, I'm always trailing teenagers around, and Friday was a big night for them as it was homecoming night at the local high school.  So, I met a big group of folks from the church at the football game.  I also ran into a couple of youth minister friends from other churches in town, and we were standing around talking during the pregame festivities.  Suddenly we realized that everyone around us had gotten quiet, and we found ourselves chatting during the beginning of the National Anthem.  Of course, we stopped talking, put our hands over our hearts, and pariotically observed the Stars and Stripes.  But what if we hadn't?  What would have happened if we had not stopped talking?  What if we had continued to disrespect the flag, and our country.  I imagined the scenario...Men and women from all over the stands giving us the evil eye, and some people probably speaking up about why we couldn't pay some respect to all of those men and women who lost their lives to provide us with some freedom.  Certainly a good point.  But I have to wonder, why aren't we as offended when people fail to show some respect to our Lord, who like our soldiers, certainly paid the ultimate price to provide us with freedom.  Why don't we get up in arms about people showing disrespect to him?  When were watching TV and they use his name like a play-thing, what's our reaction?  We probably don't remember our reaction cause we were too busy still watching the show...  I certainly wouldn't want to be mean to someone because they were ignorant of what they were doing to Christ...that wouldn't help them come any closer to knowing him.  But am I condoning it by my inaction?

      Well, the hour is nearly upon us.  (ok, not us...Me)  I'm leaving for on the cruise in about 36 hours...This will be my last blog post as a cruiseless wonder.  So, here goes.  Enjoyed high school Bible Study today...we studied John chapter 5 and Jesus healing the lame man at the pool of Bethesda.  The kids seemed to get more into the lesson than they normally do, and when they get more into it, they get more out of it...Funny how that works.  Nice to actually have a few answers to questions, too.  Also, I read through almost all of the new Relevant magazine.  Seriously...if you haven't checked out  urlLink Relevant Magazine , you're missing out...I know I've said that before, but listen to me!!!  I'm gonna try to get some good video of the trip.  Maybe, if you're my friend, you'll get to see some.  By the way, if you're reading this, and I don't talk to you about my blog a lot already (you know who you are), let me know!  I'd love to know who's out there!  Be blessed on your Turkey Day...     By the way, I got this off of another blog today, concerning some church relationship stuff I've been thinking/talking about lately...it was really well worded:      “I will not be moved” Emotionally, Culturally, or Doctrinally…     That's obviously the motto of alot of people who are getting their heads busted wide open against the wall of world change.  The Southern White Middle Class Male Dominant Accapella expression of allegiance and love to God (by men and women) is understandable to me - as long as it doesn't try to stop someone else from expressing allegiance and love to God in a different way in their midst!  The church has a mission - It's crystal clear! Tolerance is necessary and godly - for both extremes. However, I do have a growing preference for which extreme I lean toward, but it's becoming even clearer to me that the extremes miss the point of it all and the middle seem to stay stagnant. What to do, what to do!  I don't want to do anything where either end walks away saying "We won"! Neither do I want to do anything that leaves the middle stagnant and failing to fulfill the mission b/c of apathy and frustration with the extremes.  What I want to do is move - I want to move right in line with where i discern God moving me. I determine that by what I sense him leading me to do in contemplative times of worship and prayer and within a certain level of comunal discernment.  Sometimes, you just have to do what you sense God leading you to do and take the risk of some people not following! I'm tired of the Romans 14 manipulation junk - I don't see a whole lot of people actually stumbling at the extremes, but I see a whole world stumbling over Christianity because of the debate itself.  Come on people - the mission is not to make me happy or comfortable. The multicultural expressions of love and devotion to God are not what it's all about - I know we will all never "get that?"   "I Will Not Be Moved" - It's probably on the marquee of an abandoned church building somewhere in this world!

      I just wrote a long post here, and it got erased...It stinks trying to get all the settings adjusted just right on this computer...wish it was automatically set like my old one...  Anyway...the retreat is over, and I'm on the downhill side.  The feels a lot better.  Even with another youth minister helping me, it was a very stressful event to plan.  I came home sick with flu-like symptoms, and stayed home sick yesterday, but my fever broke last night and I feel fine today, so I'm back to work now.  During the past couple of weeks, with all the retreat prep and stuff, I've gotten behind on my reading.  I'm stuck in the middle of "The Bible Jesus Read," and I haven't even started St. Augustine's "Confessions" or Mortimer Adler's "How to Read a Book," both of which are sitting on my desk in the same spot they have for 3 weeks, and both of which are overdue at the library.  I'll get to them, I promise.  I miss my reading...  On that note, here's a good quote passed on to me from another youth minister friend..."If you want to be a great person, spend time with great people, visit great places, and read great books."  Oh yeah..."And know Jesus."  Also, got my first copy of Relevant Magazine in the mail today...I'll read more into it later, but I'm impressed with what I've seen so far.  Big picture of P.O.D. on the cover, not that that means much to me...maybe it will after I read it.  The other articles are good!  Blessings...

      I really don't have time to be writing in this thing this week.  I've been up to my ears in work, and I'm totally consumed with getting things finished before the youth group retreat that starts tonight.  But I haven't written here in a week.  So...It's time.  My week's been crazy.  I've worked, worked some more, and then I worked.  No days off, no free time.  Just work.  We had our annual Turkey Bowl on Sunday, where the youth group kids take on the adults in flag football.  Went ok.  Just a little bit better than last year, but not much.  I get really frustrated when the people playing start arguing and yelling at each other about a stupid football game.  I get as competitive as the next guy, but I can't stand to think that I'd treat people that I love, my faith family, as though I want to kick their teeth in because things aren't going my way with a pointy ball.  Wow.  That's frustrating.  On an upnote, I got a new computer this week.  A nice Dell Laptop.  On the downside, it's almost solely for work use, and I had to pay for it because the church can't afford to.  Stinks to not have a youth ministry budget.  Oh well...It gets a little personal use...I'm typing on it to you right now!  Going to retreat in T-minus 383 minutes and counting.  Must work.  After this retreat, it's all downhill for a week as I get prepared (excited) for the cruise my family is taking to the Caribbean.  That, my friend, is good times.  Till next time...

      Had a great time going to Austin yesterday to promote one of our area wide youth events to the youth ministers there.  (Ok, so waking up at 5:15 was a little too early for all that, but the rest was good.)  The highlight of the trip was talking to a buddy all the way home about reading and writing, two disciplines that I'm intently trying to develop in myself.  I felt like his experience and insight were helpful in the planning and goal setting that I'm trying to do for myself about writing.  Reading, after some years of practice, is starting to occur naturally to me, but the writing is still an effort.  My mom hit a deer this morning with her suburban...Called and woke me up at 7:30, but I was glad she told me about it.  She was probably going about 60, so I'm glad she's ok.  Of course, being the guy that I am, after finding out she was ok, I wanted to know about the deer, how big it was, and how many points it had.  Of course, being the girl she is, she didn't know.  Too bad...she knew she had seen horns, and when they looked for it later, it had been taken.  At least someone is getting that venison.  Wish it'd been me.

      So yesterday, I led the discussion at our church's on-campus lunch/bible study at the local community college.  I talked about consumerism and Jesus' interaction with the rich young ruler who was asked to sell everything he had, give to the poor and follow Jesus.  Today I'm looking at computers online, with intent to purchase, so that I'll have a machine that will be capable of functions that I seriously think would be beneficial and productive for my youth ministry.    Man...these computers cost a lot, though.  It's interesting to try to contemplate the correlations between my lesson yesterday, and my decision today.  I do think that the church and the ministry will benefit from my buying a new computer, but it sure is a major purchase that probably is more of a luxury item than not (After all, the church has existed and ministered for almost 2000 years without computers most of that time).  Decisions, Decisions.    I'm reminded of the fact that today's teenagers are media-flooded but still media hungry, and that current theory suggests that media is an effective means of reaching them.  On top of that, since we live in a small, blue-collar town, the technology of yesterday seems new and exciting here today, so using it is still effective.  Also, electronic communication is so prevalent with teens that it's actually more effective than personal visits and phone calls where teens frequently clam up and seem to be unable to communicate as clearly as when on AIM or e-mail.  I am amazed at the frequency of answers like, "I don't know...," or "It's hard to explain," or "I don't know how to explain it" when I ask questions about things that are constantly on teen's minds.  So, I'll probably buy a computer, trying to be "all things to all people" and all.  I want to be faithful to the power of the gospel to change lives, rather than the power of electricity and megabytes...I just hope the computer is powerful enough a tool to make the gospel palatable to teenagers who are bored with yesterday's big thing...

      I really enjoy reading  urlLink Mike Cope's blog .  He's the preacher at the church I attended while I was in college and though he doesn't know me (the church had over 2000 members) I connect well with his writing and his thoughts.    This last Wednesday, I got a call from the missionary friend who works full time in Honduras, but was in the states for the week.  He was staying about 30 minutes from where I live, so I invited him to come for church that night.  Was great to see him, and as we ate together afterwards, I loved gleaning more excitement about mission work from him.  I constantly feel like full-time missions is something that I would like to have in my future.  I don't know when or where, but I'd like to be a part of that.  I long to be somewhere where people are hungry for the gospel, rather than the people I deal with who aren't hungry for it, but rather are apathetic about it because they have heard it so much.  My missionary friend told me of sharing the Old Testament stories of God's mighty works with grown adults who had never heard them, and seeing eyes get as big as saucers when he described the fiery furnace, the parting of the sea, the lion's den, Goliath, and the flood.  I long to be around hunger like that.  And yet, while my passion for sharing the truth is fiery and strong, ministry is frustrating today.  I wish I was better at this job.  I'm constantly frustrated by the concept that if I was really being faithful to allowing God to work (me getting out of the way), he would be doing amazing things in this youth ministry.  I don't want to get better at youth ministry.  I want to get more dependant for ministry.  And yet, the lack of results tells me I'm relying on myself.  Guess I just keep pluggin, huh?

      Leaving today on a Christmas trip to Atlanta.  Get to see some cousins and second cousins that I haven't seen in over 11 years.  I'm way excited about that.  Unfortunately, my youth minister buddy that works at a church in Atlanta is in Texas visiting his family, so we're trading spaces and don't get to see each other.  Like ships in the night...  I've been battling a head cold or some kind of majorly annoying allergy for a couple days now...pray, if you would, that it'll go away soon so that I won't have to fight it in Atlanta (or in the car for that matter...)  I'll be taking my laptop to work on my sermon, so maybe I'll get a chance to blog while I'm there.  Hope to write more soon!

      Picked up a copy of Dan Kimball's "The Emerging Church" yesterday, so I guess you'll be hearing about it for a few weeks.  I am kinda stressed about getting my sermon and Spring Youth Calendar done, as I'd like to finish both of them before I leave for Atlanta for Christmas.  Sermon's gonna be a doosy...  Today I gave two friends a ride to the airport so that they could fly home for Christmas...that was fun, and it was great to spend time with them in the car, and then have a long time riding alone in their car on the way home.  I think I sing pretty loud!  I hope that my time with my family is great next week...I was sad last night because I went home, but didn't get to spend anytime with my middle brother because he was out with his friends.  I know that he doesn't see a problem with it because we'll see each other all next week, but I sure would like to become one of his friends...the kind he wants to hang out with.  I think that in the future, we'll both want that, but we'll find it hard because it won't come naturally due to the time we've spent avoiding each other while we were young.  Have to go to the children's ministry's Christmas Play now...see ya!

      So, I've been asked to preach in place of our normal preacher for the week after Christmas.  We're trying to split up some of the responsibilities of the winter holidays.  Trouble is, he's preaching sermons from the springboard of secular Christmas songs.  Guess what...I'm preaching (the my knowledge) the first EVER sermon based on "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer."  No kidding...yeah, I asked myself the same questions you're asking yourself now...  So, things here are good.  I'm hoping to fish tomorrow since it's been way too long since I've been out.  I'm afraid I'll dry out if I don't get back to the water quickly.  Also, sometime in the next couple of days I have to build a manger for a Christmas play going on at our church...hope that works out easily.  Exciting weekend ahead of Christmas parties and white elephant gifts...who knows...maybe this time next week I'll be cashing in a lotto ticket that I got at a party that made me a millionaire!  Then I can do youth ministry for free!  That'll be good times.  And my only chance to win the lottery...  See ya!

      So, yeah, the cruise was totally awesome.  Actually, what was really awesome was our time in Mexico on the day stops and the water that we got to see and SCUBA dive in while we were there.  I was totally impressed with the water.  It was crazy because it was so clear that the depth was kinda deceptive.  We went out in this boat to go SCUBA diving, and we were flying across the water, and it was so clear that we could see the bottom really well.  When we finally stopped to dive, we got in and the water was 40 feet deep!  I was amazed!  I don't really have a good reason for having not blogged since we got back.  Just laziness.  BUT...I did start a picture Blog and so far it has a grand total of 1 picture on it so far.  So...the link's over on the right.  Went to the prison today to sing with our prison ministry.  That was pretty cool, but I wasn't quite as motivated about it today as I remember being last year, so I had trouble getting real into it.  Anyway, it was ok.  Devo tonight went well too, and I felt like the kids got into the lesson more than they normally do, so that was great.  Hope your week is great!  I'll be back to write more!

      Went fishing and only fishing today, which is to say that I did not go "catching" today.  Went with a 73-year old friend from church.  Didn't ever even see a fish.  Come to think of it, I didn't even see a mullet jump which has to be a first as that's a common occurance in the bays of Texas.  So, the fishing was uneventful, but we made some highlights of our own.  We found some water that was protected from the wind so it was not stirred up with dirt, and I can finally say that I have now seen the water they're referring to when they say "gin-clear."  The water was absolutely gorgeous, seemingly clearer than tap water.  I was very impressed with how clean it could get, and it was fun to fish.  It was really weird though because a rare occurance happened as we were fishing...the wind was blowing hard from the north and very consistent, which was adding a little chill to the conditions, and then suddenly and very noticibly in the course of about 10 seconds, the wind shifted and started coming out of the west.  It was a really weird thing to experience, and it quickly muddied up the gin-clear water we were fishing.  Finally the other interesting occurance was when we were cruising in the boat at about 45 miles per hour, and suddenly we hit shallow water and the boat dug into the mud and stopped REALLY quickly.  My friend was hurled around the console and wound up on the floor, which was really funny once I made sure he was ok.  After that, we were so stuck in the mud that I had to strip down to my scivies and get out to push the boat back to deeper water, where it almost floated away without me, leaving me standing in the middle of the bay in my underwear, with a wind blowing 25 miles per hour in January.  That'd have been a story for the grandkids...  Speaking of stories for the grandkids, I'm hoping to see the new movie, "Big Fish" in the next week or so.  I think it's gonna be a good one.  Started reading a review of it today on relevantmagazine.com, but realized that the review was giving too much of the story away, so I stopped reading it.   Tonight I took the youth group to play laser tag with the youth group from the church where I grew up, which means I got to see my little brother too, which is always awesome.  I really surprised myself by placing 2nd and 1st out of 33 people in the two games of laser tag I played in.  I have no idea how I did so well.  It was especially funny because I came out of the second game thinking to myself how much worse I had done than in the first, but got to the lobby and found out that I had won, so that was cool.  Tomorrow I head to Austin to attend the wedding of two of my close friends from college.  Looking forward to getting to see a lot of old friends and I anticipate that the time to return home to Alvin will come too soon.  I'll be anxious to stay and hang around with them for longer than I'll be able to.  I'm heading home to get some sleep so that I can come back to the building early to stretch carpet in the high school classroom before I leave for Austin.  Pray for my safe travel.  Ya'll have a great Saturday...

      I've been reading this week!  (And there was much rejoicing, Yeah!)  Started Celebration of Discipline and I'm really enjoying getting through it.  The chapters on fasting and meditation kicked my butt, but I was very encouraged by the chapter on Studying because it outlined a lot of different types of study and they were things that I feel like I do well anyway.  I don't think I was looking for the ego boost as much as I just appreciated the redirection it provided.  Up till now, my study has been an effort to develop myself so that I'd be better at the disciplines.  Now, I feel affirmed that my study is one of the disciplines, and through that affirmation, I now can change my attitude about study and start making it something that glorifies God in and of itself.  Good times.  Found out today about a new faithful reader of my Blog...great news except that now I have one more reason that I need to keep up with this thing better.  Maybe the reading will help!  Pray for my youth ministry team meeting tonight.  I need to be a better communicator of vision, and a better recruiter.  Pray that the Lord will work in those ways in my place tonight as I am weak there.

      I really haven't had anything insightful to say lately.  I don't know if that's because I haven't read as much, or just because I'm thinking more than I'm saying.  Christmas, New Year's and all that were fine...not the best one's I've ever had, but not bad.  I look forward to holidays in the future when I'm not in such a limbo-like transitional period of life.    Watched a video today on the web of a guy trying to hunt a lion and then getting attacked by it.  That was kinda funny.  If you wanna check it out, the address is  urlLink www.huntn.biz   Anyway, hope all of you loyal readers (both of you) are doing great.  See ya...

      Well, I spent almost the entire day yesterday on my kayak.  Great times.  I explored some parts of Christmas Bay that I've never seen before, including some that you can't get to in another boat.  Didn't even come close to catching any fish, but it was totally fun anyway.  Different day fishing by yourself though.  I was struck by the idea that I probably didn't say 1000 words yesterday, which is a rarity for anyone who can speak.  The nice thing is that there were glimpses of time alone yesterday that I was able to be quiet and try to, as I always read about, "Listen to God."  Can't say that I heard anything, but I know that he heard me and will answer my prayer to develop myself into a better "God Listener."  Of course, I was missing the stillness part that is so often connected with listening to Him...That'll be another challenge for another day.  I'm leaving tomorrow morning for Abilene,  urlLink ACU , and the annual  urlLink Bible Lectureship .  It'll be a great time since a large part of my extended family will be there, and we'll spend the week together focusing on God, specifically on the book of Isaiah.  Pray for my safe travel.  This week I watched my all time favorite sermon 7 times on video tape.  However, this sermon is my favorite because it challenges me and the church so much.  I got the bright idea to show the tape to some other Christians in our church, and after watching it with them 3 times, they have challenged me to present some ideas to the elders that are very groundbreaking and would require a huge shift in our thinking and actions as a church.  I am not ready for this kind of responsibility or task, but seem to be the one being commissioned for it.  I will continue to pray on this matter as well.  Hope your week is great, whoever you are out there reading all this.  God is good.  Remember that...  I'll be back on Thursday.

      Ideas from "How to Read a Book," by Mortimer Adler:  "What are the conditions under which good reading takes place?  There are two...      First, the writer must be superior to the reader...and the book must contain...the insights that he possesses and his potential readers lack      Second, the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree...always approaching equality with the writer."   No Wonder it takes such great thinkers and smart people to really write well.  I've been able to put together some really well worded sentences before, but the people who write the classics...the philosophers and thinkers...obviously are superior to their writers, and their writings are great because they are built to allow the reader to "approach" equality with the writer.  Makes sense...

      Tough day for me...NOT!  Went to the Houston Area-wide youth minister's meeting where we met about our current events, ate FREE OLIVE GARDEN, listened to a presentation from one of my old college profs, prayed for a hour, and then played basketball...my kinda day.  Presentation was good too...  I think I'm gonna run over to the office supply store tonight a pick up a couple things...that presentation gave me some ideas.  Also, the weight loss thing is going well.  I haven't had a soft drink or tea for over 2 weeks, and I've lost about 6 pounds....GOOD TIMES...  Have a great night.

      Well, I guess the time has come.  I've left you all hanging out there long enough with nothing new to read, and since I know you've been desperately worrying about whether I was still around, here's the latest...  Not Much...   Actually, two weekends ago I went on our church men's retreat, which was a lot of fun because I got to 1) hang with the guys from church and 2) get to know another guy close to my age who I hope will become a close friend in the coming months.  The weather for the retreat was really nasty and rainy, but we had a great time anyway.  Once again, I was reminded that I know nothing about freshwater fishing.  Fast forward a week to last night's Super Bowl Party here at the church...I took some trash out to the dumpster, only to find the dumpster overflowing, and we hadn't even started cleaning up from the party, so I knew there'd be a lot more trash.  Something had to be done...Enter - ME.  So I climbed up on the dumpster and started walking on the trash to crumple it down.  All was going well up until the last bag, which I stepped on and caused to immediately tear, which sent a rush of lukewarm liquid substance running down my leg into my shoe.  Wow...what a feeling.  Hope that was just water.  I think I'm ready to start truck-shopping.  I don't need a new truck...just a new one to me.  Mine has developed quite a few minor problems that could become major ones at anytime, plus I need the better gas milage of a fuel injection system...So...we'll see.  Until next time!

      This is great...Thoughts on updating your blog...    "it's getting so easy to update a web log that some users seem to type in their thought willy nilly, posting unimaginable banalities like a nation of alan partridges trying to fill an internet's worth of dead air: CDs they're listening to, scintillating accounts of their day at work, urls of sites they feel they should acknowledge, despite having nothing new to say about them. it is like one of those terrible christmas family newsletters for every single day of the year."

      My Reflections...  I watched our members during the Lord's Supper Today.  As we finished singing about Amazing Love as if we were a people totally unamazed by that love, I was struck by how badly we have allowed ourselves to be crippled by a world more amazed by the sight of the blood given, than by the offer of the blood giver.  As words were recited about the life of David - a man after God's own heart - we pursued the desires of our hearts and minds as we tuned out the voice of the speaker.  The text read, the prayer said, we passed the bread.  As we silently partook of a "communal" meal, even the sound of cracker cracking on metal was muffled as much as possible.  A tray was passed down one row in my line of sight, and after it passed, I heard the familiar, "pffftt....." of a bottled soft drink opening and carbonation escaping.  For one Christian, the refreshment of a coke chased the dryness of the un-risen bread that reminds us of a risen savior.   The bitterness of the sacrifice Christ made to satisfy our greatest need, followed by the world's cheap answer to our need for temporary relief.  What a contrast.  And that contrast describes our attitude in worship.  We seek our own comfort while we "celebrate" our leader because he DID NOT seek his own comfort.  To sing with vigor would require energy...not comfort.  To be truly amazed at His love would require contemplation...not comfort.  To encourage each other during the meal would require vulnerability...not comfort.  It seems that our battle cry in the fights over worship and style has always involved finding what our members are comfortable with.  Well...I'm not comfortable with seeking our own comfort...

      I've had trouble getting caught up on energy this week.  SoulLink week really was draining, as was the preaching preperation on Saturday night and Sunday morning.  SoulLink, our Houston-area teen conference, was the best ever.  The classes went a lot better than they ever have, and we were all really satisfied with the experience.  As a result, I've been a little under-motivated this week.  Looking forward to lock-in on Friday night though.  Next week I'm leaving to go to Kingsville so that I can go fishing, and there's a chance that my fishing buddy from church will get off work and get to come with me, so that'll be great times!  Hoping I might get to fish tomorrow as well.  Focusing on my prayer life as of late, which has resulted in a decrease in my reading.  So, not much new material to talk about yet, but I'm appreciating the increase in my prayer efforts.  God is working.  Have a blessed week.

      Busy Week for me this week.  With the fast approach of SoulLink on the horizon, and the addition of a sermon to preach on Sunday due to the preacher's new grandbaby's arrival and the preacher's subsequent plans to skip town this weekend.  This will certainly be a busy one for me.  I'm wrestling with the text of my sermon and exactly what I'm trying to say.  I don't feel that I'm wrestling as smartly as I'd like.  I don't yet feel equipped to handle a text as masterfully as most of the preachers that I look up to, and yet, I imagine that they would say the same...that they aren't prepared to handle a text yet in many ways.  But somehow their messages always hit home, and it's a testimony to God's work through the speaker and his breath through the speaker's mouth.  I pray for that this weekend.  Picked up a "new" book this week..."The Way of the Heart" by Henri Nouwen.  He was one of the people written about in Yancey's "Soul Survivor" which is another great book.  I've read/owned "The Way of the Heart" before, but I loaned it to someone about 5 years ago and never got it back.  No biggy...it's a cheap book anyway.  Looking forward to rest...

      Kind words from my HONEST brother yesterday...  He said, "Brock, no offense, but when we started playing golf today and you said that you hadn't played in a few months so you might be out of practice I thought to myself, 'Surely it can't be that bad.'  But then once we got started, I realized you were right...it was that bad..."  I can't describe more accurately the pitiful way that I "played golf" yesterday...need to hit the driving range before the tourney this weekend.     In other good golf tournament news, I read a website yesterday about the course where we're playing this weekend...here's a quote straight from the web-page.   ---"It's not unusual to see an alligator or two in the wetlands by holes 13 and 15, so watch the kids and ball-searching there."    WHOA!

      It's a really scary thing to think that I would play in a golf tournament.  My golfing skills are the cause of much frustration for me, and sympathy from my friends, but I'm set to play in a tournament with my Dad this weekend.  Scary thought.  I have only played in one other tournament in my life...a real informal scramble after work one day at the plant where my dad works.  We drew straws to pick teams, so I ended up on a team with a bunch of old guys that I didn't know who were really there to drink and smoke cigars the whole time.  The funny part when, on the 5th hole, I was taking a practice swing before I stepped up to the ball to hit, but I apparently got a closer than I thought I was, because I hit the ball during my practice swing.  Since I wasn't stepped all the way up to it, I hit the ball off the end of the club so it went straight in the direction I was facing, not straight off the club face.  The ball hit the golf cart that one of the old men was sitting on and he spilled beer all over himself because it scared him...  I'll let you know if anything equally funny happens this time.

      Lonely days are hard, and don't seem to have a good effect on me because when I'm lonely, I work more.  I've spent my day going back and forth between home and work, watching TV or working at my desk.  It has rained all day, which has hampered my half-hearted plans for riding my bike to get some exercise today.  Did get to have a good conversation with the couple that is leading the marriage seminar at the church this weekend.  They were a blessing as they spoke faithfully about my promising future.  It's weird to experience a day with little-to-no human contact.  That happens more and more often these days.  I'd have gotten a lot of good reading done if Amazon would deliver my graduate school books, but alas, they're slower than molasses in January.  Blessings on you, my friends.

      Eugene Peterson is talking to me a lot about Annie Dillard right now.  She's a writer who is very attentive to God in the creation...she studies creation for all its good and bad and finds God in it.  She compares the church's worship with man's expeditions to the north pole.  There is a constant goal in mind, but always a changing strategy, frustrations, struggles and hardships.  Sometimes, we don't make it.  But still, knowing all this, we still try.  She says that wherever we go, to the North Pole or to church, "there seems to be only one business at hand: that of finding workable compromises between the sublimity of our ideas and the absurdity of the fact of us."  She tells stories of North Pole expeditions who failed because the tried to do it too fancily and with too much unnecessary equipment, and of expeditions that failed because someone tried to do it alone.  Finally, to describe our services, she says, "A high school play is more polished than this service we have been rehearsing since the year one.  In two thousand years we have not worked out the kinks."  Interesting thoughts.  What'd I get out of it?  We can't do this worship thing alone, and we can't try so hard that we don't depend on God to help us get it right.  When we worship, we're inviting Jesus into our presence because he's willing to be among tax-collectors and sinners.  Getting it right is only and invitation...    Moving on...  Lonely evening tonight.  Couldn't think of anything to do, so I did what I absolutely hate...I shopped.  Not because I wanted to, but because I needed some new undershirts, socks, shorts, t-shirts and shoes.  Anyway, I still refrain from buying much because my non-sense of fashion will defeat me everytime and send me to work wearing clothes that are "so 1999" if I trust myself to pick out clothes...Have to be careful.  Wouldn't want the teenagers thinking I was an old guy, huh?

      My best friend's Dad, Greg, died less than two years ago...  He was in a band in his younger years, and played with two friends named Buddy and Bob.  Throughout their lives, although moving away from each other, they remained close friends.  Their families were friends, and they all had a great impact on each other.  Not long after Greg died of cancer after a two year struggle, Buddy passed on as well.  Today, my best friend called me to let me know that Bob died last night...he had been aware of cancer in his body for less than 24 hours, but it was in the final stages and he didn't last long.  Amazing, the speed of death.  My friend keeps having to face the deaths of those close to him (which makes me wonder about the wisdom of being close to him!) and I hurt for him.  Life is not easy for any of us, but seems like it is especially cruel to him right now.  I feel less sorry for myself today.

      I'm noticing more and more that I'm more forgetful than I used to be...or at least more than I remember being in the past.  (Think about it...think about it...)  Seems like every morning while I'm getting ready for work, I'll think of some things that I need to do...people to call today, something to bring to the office from home that I'm gonna need, appointments that I need to schedule, birthdays to remember...and from the time I get out of the shower and the time I get to the door to leave, all of that thinking is ancient history and there's not much chance of any of it happening until about a week later.  Maybe the water in the shower's too hot...messing with my head.  This morning, I'm supposed to be leaving for a fishing trip to South Texas, but alas, my plans were foiled because of a boat motor that wouldn't start.  So, I'm working all week when I was planning on being on vacation.  I'm noticing that the work-week feels eternally long when you weren't planning on being a part of it.  So, this morning is a little sad.

      Crazy things going on here that I never thought would happen...I picked up my old greek book last week that I learned from during my freshman year of college.  I never wanted to touch that thing again, but I'm going to have to know greek for graduate school, so it's time to start learning it again.  My current frustrations in ministry are seemingly large, but Eugene Peterson has addressed them recently for me.  Here he is:   "The person...who looks for quick results in the seed planting of well-doing will be disappointed.  If I want potatoes for dinner tomorrow, it will do me little good to go out and plant potatoes in my garden tonight.  There are long stretches of darkness and invisibility and silence that separate planting and reaping.  During the stretches of waiting there is cultivating and weeding and nurturing and planting still other seeds."

      Stream in the Desert was a good experience, once again.  And, once again, the highlight was the leadership conference on Friday Morning before Stream actually began.   urlLink Rick Atchley  spoke all weekend, specifically on Friday calling us as ministers to return to preaching repentance and the good news of the kingdom of God.  It was a great calling...especially the statement that we have been "guilty of preaching ABOUT Jesus, but not LIKE Jesus."  I'm currently reading "Travelling Mercies" by Anne Lamott.  Interesting insightful irreverence from a Christian author.  Seems that the people around me with whom I've shared portions of the book are not as impressed with her insight as I am, but she comes highly recommended from minister friends whose opinions I trust so I will stay the course for now.  One token complaint about Stream...Where's the single ladies?

      Remembered one of the main reasons that I got into youth ministry last night.  I went to San Antonio to be with the kids from my old youth group that I used to work with because they were having a senior banquet for their graduates.  It was great to see all of them, but the greatest part was that after the party and after visiting a few people at their homes that I needed to see, I got to sit on the patio at Taco Cabana for about 2 hours with three of my coolest students ever.  Matt, Matt and Candice were like medicine for me last night, just sitting there, hanging out and laughing a lot, and letting me be a friend to them.  Three kids that are doing a great job of trying to be like Jesus, and their enthusiasm for life and their joy is contagious.  I long for those kind of relationships with kids in the youth group here, but it's been difficult.  Still praying though.  Trying to get ready for summer has been a stressor as well, and I never feel like I do this well, but here we go...it's coming whether I'm ready or not.  I felt like I needed to update this thing, but my mind's not really in it right now, other than what I've already written.  I'll be back...

      The Prayer of a Preacher (From Michel Quoist's book, "Prayers")    I spoke, Lord, and I am furious. I am furious because I worked so hard with gestures and with words. I threw my whole self into them, and I'm afraid the essential didn't get across. For the essential is not mine, and words alone are too shallow to hold it.  I spoke, Lord, and I am worried. I am afraid of speaking, for speaking is serious; It's serious to disturb others, to bring them out, to keep them on their doorsteps; It's serious to keep them waiting, with outstretched hands and longing hearts, seeking for light or some courage to live and act. Suppose, Lord, that I should send them away, empty-handed!  And yet, I must speak. You have given me speech for a few years, and I must make use of it. I owe my soul to others, and words are crowding my lips to bring it to them. For the soul could hardly express itself if speech were taken from it. We know nothing of the infant inside its little body. And the whole family rejoices when, word by word, phrase by phrase, its soul is revealed to them. But when one of the family is dying, the others stand despairing by his bed, listening intently to his last words. He passes on, locked in silence, and his relatives will no longer know his soul, once they have shut his eyes and closed his lips.  Speech, Lord, is a gift, and I have no right to be quiet through pride, cowardice, negligence or apathy. Others have a right to my words, to my soul, For I have a message from you to give them, And none other than I, Lord, can give it to them. I have something to say - short perhaps, but welling up from my life - from which I cannot turn. But my words must be true words. It would be a breach of trust to seek the attention of another, and under the cover of words not to reveal the truth of the soul. The words that I pour out must be living words, full of the mysteries that my unique soul has grasped, mysteries of the world and of man. The words that I speak must be conveyors of God, for the lips that you have given me, Lord, are made to reveal my soul, and my soul knows you and holds you close.  Forgive me, Lord, for having spoken so badly, Forgive me, Lord, for having spoken often to no purpose; Forgive me for the days when I tarnished my lips with hollow     words,    false words,    cowardly words,    words through which you could not pass. Uphold me when I must speak in a meeting, intervene in a discussion, talk with a brother. Grant above all, Lord, that my words may be like the sowing of seeds, And that those who hear them may look to a fine harvest.

      Tomorrow's Senior Sunday.  I'm preaching.  My family's coming to listen.  My seniors are finishing school.  It's an important day, and I really should have my sermon finished, but instead I'm writing here.  The week has been busy with taking care of lots of duties, catching up from being away at Abilene last week, and what-not.  Seems like there's still a lot more that I would have liked to get done.  And it's at this point that I remember one of those Life-changing lessons that I have to hang my hat on...  THE LORD AND THE CHURCH HAVE BEEN MINISTERING FOR 2000 YEARS BEFORE I GOT HERE, SO IT'S NOT MY JOB TO WORK SO HARD TO TRY TO GET EVERYTHING DONE.  In fact, most ministers I think rob the members of their church of the opportunity to serve because we get so caught up in trying to get things done on our own.  It's a fine balance because the things I'm getting done feel really important to me as a Christian, not just as a minister.  I'd like to think I'd be doing them even if I wasn't in full time ministry.  But there are other responsibilities that have to be taken care of as well, and here I am, 9:00 on Saturday night and the sermon's not done.  I'm glad it's not all up to me...

      Exciting times...Finished the grad school class which was great, but that only means that the work starts now.  I've got nearly 60 pages worth of papers to write that are due in August/September, and I've already signed up for two internet courses to take during the fall.  Started reading "Leaving Ruin," which is a novel by a guy that used to be the worship leader at Highland, Jeff Berryman.  Really enjoying the book.  Some of the prayers that the main character prays in the book while teaching the beatitudes are beautiful.  Be blessed by this one which he prays while introducing the sermon on the mount...   Dear God,  We sit and wait for your words.  Carve the words into us, Lord, let us know your words as we know the heat of the desert, in our pores, and don't forget to give us water when we forget to drink.  We are foolish, we know.  But we want to listen, we want to walk on the mountain with you, but we are stuck down below, and our hands cannot reach high.  Will we hear you today, O God, or will we only talk to hear our heads rattle, empty pots of pride and boasting?  Speak, Maker, and with a God's war-hammer break the stearn fortress, and march around our stupidity and rage seven days, and blow trumpets and shout, so that we might fall to a gentler rule.  I wish you were here to speak.  Walk among us.  Amen.

      Graduate School...  I'm afraid maybe this is the calm before the storm.  The class has been incredibly easy so far, and so it's weird to think that I'm in graduate school.  The class I'm taking, Advanced Youth Ministry, is very applicable to what I'm doing.  It's funny because the professor that taught all my youth ministry classes in undergrad is in the class with me as a student...crazy stuff.  Time in Abilene has been fun.  Have gotten to hang out with brother a little bit, and that's been good...need more of it though.  Hope your week is blessed...will write more later

      Apparently, I still kinda stink at golf.  I played decently on Friday, scoring a 95 on 18 holes, which is just a little bit worse than bogey golf.  They rank everyone according to score, and create 4 divisions in the rankings, so everyone is either an A, B, C or D golfer.  I was a C...which means I was better than 1/4 of the guys there I guess, so that's not too bad.  But it means I was worse than at least half of the guys there too, and lots of them were senior citizens.  I was frequently humbled and shown up by one 75+ guy that was in my four-some who kept hitting the ball farther than I did.  (It helped my ego to know that both of us were out hitting my Dad...)  We played on our teams this morning, but got rained out after only 6 holes.  I saw 2 alligators...they were both shorter than I am, but where there's babies, there's got to be a mama I guess, so I'm glad I made it back safe.  On Thursday, I received my 4 books for my first graduate school class...I have to have them all read by May 10.  So...I'm supposed to be reading, but I'm typing to ya'll instead...I love my readers, don't I!?!?!  Till next time...

      Amid various youth group activities, I'm busy counting days until I can leave town to visit the girlfriend.  The days seem very long, and keeping myself occupied with ministry tasks is only a limited relief.  Can't wait to head south.  Phone conversations with her are marvelous, and are a joy to me everyday, but they only make me long to see her that much more.  Yesterday, after spending about 6 hours on the road taking a group of kids to camp, I came back to the church for a congregational meeting, and then took a group of 7 kids out to play ultimate frisbee, which is becoming one of my favorite games to play.  I'm terribly aware when I play it that I've lost a step or 10 since my old high school soccer days, but it's a blast to get out there and run around.  It would only be more fun if we could get more people to play.  Hard to solicit much involvement from some of the teens, it seems.  Today I'll go to MD Anderson Cancer Center and sit with a family whose grandpa is having cancer surgery today.  The ministry of presence is one of the greatest things I think I learned in my ACU education.  Their expression for it was, "Don't just do something...stand there!"  So, I'm on my way to go stand.  Still haven't started reading anything new.  Anyone have any ideas about what to read right now?

      Today we went to Texas Children's Hospital to spend some time visiting one of our youth group girls that's having some tests run and has to stay there for a week.  We had a good time getting to see her, and after talking and praying over her, we went down to the hospital chapel and spent a little bit of time praying for the other patients in the hospital.  I'm hoping that was a teaching time for the students that were with me...I'd sure love to see our group become more dependent on prayer.  Things have been going well here...God is answering prayers consistently, most recently in the form of someone new to date.  I've been praying for quite some time that the Lord would provide a girl for me to start a relationship with, and that she would be someone who was marriage minded and mature.  I have had just such a young lady dropped in my lap (actually while I was away at grad school in May) and am praising the Lord for his provision as I now have a great girl to date.  Please be praying that the relationship will be healthy and also for my ability to lead spiritually the way I need to always...May I point us toward the Lord and his movements.  Unfortunately, I have not been reading at all, other than a couple of articles that I've been needing to work on for graduate school stuff.  Seems I've been spending more time on the phone recently (per the young lady) and have seen the reading take a temporary back burner.  I'll get back on it...Need to make a trip to Barnes and Noble.  Summers in full swing...youth ministry is exciting right now, and I'm blessed to be a tool being used.    Blessings...

      Well, leave town for a few days on a camp trip, and everyone wants to know why you aren't blogging!  Guess I should have told you all that I was leaving.  Just returned this morning at approximately 1:45am from  urlLink Camp Barnabas ...a special needs camp for children with disabilities.  The kids from my youth group were able to work and develop relationship with these special campers.  We had a wonderful week, and the youth group kids that I took really stepped up to the plate and worked hard to provide a great camp experience for the campers.  I'm sure I'll talk more about this later, but I'm playing office catch up today, so I'll let you know.  Blessings...

      Well, the weekend was totally amazing, and all I've been able to do since then is brag on Sarah and how excited and happy I am about her.  I went to Corpus Christi to see her this weekend, and we got to spend great quality time with her family, my family, and each other.  The whole trip was great, although too short, and we can't wait to get to see each other again.  Having to readjust to phone conversation from face to face ones has not been easy.  Both of us are excited and expectant about the future, and especially ready for her to live in the Houston area.  That'll be a great day...  I feel terrible about the fact that I'm not really reading anything right now.  Yesterday I pulled "This Present Darkness" off the shelf, which is supposed to be a novel about spiritual warfare (I think).  I'm excited about reading that, but I'm not sure it's the kind of reading that I feel like I'm lacking right now.  We'll have to see.  My Bible class went well last night...I was torn up all day about how to communicate the message that I wanted to convey, but thanks to the movement of the spirit it all worked out.  I love when I'm sitting in worship and the Spirit suddenly gives me an idea that throws my plan out the window because it's so much better.  I have a great desire lately, based in part on the emphasis by some of my spiritual heroes, to learn more about the Kingdom of God and what that phrase means for us today.  At Stream in the Desert this year,  urlLink Rick Atchley  inferred that it was incorrect to simply equate the Kingdom of God with Heaven or the Church, which indicated to me that we are now living in the Kingdom of God.  I'm assuming that is due in part to the fact that Christ conquered death and was given "all authority in Heaven and Earth" when he rose from the grave.  However, I'd love to learn more about the concept of the Kingdom of God being witnessed right now.  As we sing songs asking for the reign of God, what are we asking for?  Any recommendations about where to study this?  (I guess the gospels are a good jumping off point, right?)  Blessings to you all...

      Sarah got to town last night, and all of the feelings that we've been having about each other and simply trusting that the other person was feeling as well were verified.  We both feel 100x more confident about the relationship that we were already feeling super confident about.  So...things are going great, but we covet your prayers for our wisdom.  She interviews with a home builder here in Houston today at 3:00, so we're anxiously awaiting the news from that.  Great SYS last night in the Houston area...One of our local youth ministers spoke on the need for fellowhip to keep us from falling away and how badly we need each other as Christians.  He blew it out of the water...great lesson.  Today I get to take my youth group kids bowling which is great because it means that I get to spend time hanging and relating with them.  I love these kids more and more everyday, and my heart aches for them to be in love with the LORD.  What a calling, this youth ministry...I'm loving it!  (Shameless theft of a phrase from McDonald's)  Adios.

      Wow, total change of plans.  The LORD has provided Sarah with a job interview in Houston on Tuesday of this week!  That means that my 8 day wait to see her has suddenly been reduced to a 2 day wait, and I'm absolutely thrilled that in a couple days the feelings we've been developing and trying to communicate to each other over the phone will finally be visible and conceivable...Oh the joy I'll feel upon seeing her face after the past two months of 4+ hour phone conversations stretching into the wee hours of the morning.  Be praying for us as we both feel like we're approaching the crest of the hill on a roller coaster and suddenly we'll be carried on a wild ride that's going to be fast and furious because of the combining of our two worlds, as well as the beginning of her first career job, first time to live alone, and first time to live 9 hours from home.  I have full confidence that we can, with the LORD's help, emerge on the other side of this wild ride holding each other's hand, much closer than we are now, and prepared to climb the next hill.  If this is a relationship that can continually honor the LORD and benefit the kingdom, then that is my prayer.  Talk to HIM for us, if you will.

      Down to single digits in the countdown of days until I go to South Texas to see Sarah.  Times are good, and yet the clock doesn't seem to speed up, no matter how hard we wish it together on the phone.  She's excited.  I'm excited.  We're excited.  We can hardly stand the anticipation, and yet the anticipation is what causes the excitement.  This is a great time.  Today I took a number of youth group kids to experience frisbee golf...a game that none of them had ever played.  The high school boys pulled ahead and left me with all the jr. high girls...Some of the boys spent more time in trees retrieving errant frisbees than they did playing...we drank a lot of water...it was windy...we met some guy who was drinking beer in the public park and passing out free frisbees to my boys.  All in all, it was a great day, and I think everyone had a lot of fun.  Note to anyone interested - if you decide to play frisbee golf, pick up some of the actual disc golf discs rather than playing with aerobees and cheap walmart toy frisbees...you'll play better and lose fewer of them.  Also, the youth group started a challenge to read one Psalm per day for the rest of the summer.  I made the mistake of not asking kids to declare that they were taking the challenge, so now I don't know if any of them are doing so.  I should find out.  I'd love to see them experience the wonder of the Lord through his word.  All in all, summer has been great, and amazingly, it's half way over.  I can't believe how quickly this thing is flying by.  Really makes me reconsider the preciousness of the time I get to spend with these youth group kids...sometimes it seems like it's only a few minutes.  Here's a cool quote from a youth minister friend's bio on his church's website -   "Hobbies/Interests -  I love the out of doors. Hiking, mountain biking, riding four wheelers, and sports of any kind. I love Youth Ministry and consider it enough fun to count it as a hobby on some days. On the other days, I head outdoors to get my brain back. If that happens to take me to the mountains of Colorado or New Mexico, then it's a really good day."  Good call...good call...
