      I have this friend and well we got in a huge discussion about Bush and Clinton which actually it wasn't a huge discussion at all. Anyway she says that Bush is lying about whats going on in our country and i dissagree. Even the situation about him and the weapons of mass distruction it came out to be that he was telling the truth. Everything that the demecrats say Bush lied about has been proved that he did not lie about it. Then we got talking about how when during 9/11 supposedly Bush when he heard the first plane crashed he didn't do anything and when he heard the second one crashed he still  didn't do anything. For one I think when the first plane crashed everyone thought it was a traggic          no one thought it was on purpose until the second plane crashed. So I'm sure Bush didn't think it was a national security problem either until the second plane crashed. For Second Bush thinks before he acts which I am glad because normally people who act before they think turn out to do some pretty stupid things. So I am sure he needed to think about what to do for a couple of seconds and pluss he needed to act calm. We also got on the subject of Clinton. She asked me what Clinton did so wrong. Well lets see besides lying about his personal life and making our country look like a huge joke he didn't catch Asamo bin Ladin ( i think i spelled it right.) when he had the chance and now look what happened. He couldv'e caught Bin Laden but he said"We don't want him." Well I think we did want him. He caused our economy to go way way down. He had some wierd relationship with China. Like China a communist country was giving all this money to Clinton for his election campein and what was Clinton giving back to China. Our military secrets. Somehow on Clintons watch China supposedly stole some military secrets from the U.S. Someone said on the radio that you should think about who Bin Laden would vote for... I think he would vote for Kerry and then vote for the opposite.

      Me and my parents watched a movie called "The Perfect Score." and afterwards my mom kept getting on my case on how my study skills suck. I can't help it that i'm a sophmore and I don't know how to take notes in class and whenever I try I can't read them anyway. I can't help it that I'd rather be on the phone than study for a test. It's just so hard for me to get motivated. I guess I just do better when it's 3 minutes till class and I'm cramming for a test or finishing up homework. I do better under stress I guess. I feel better when I study and do my homework at home and not 3 minutes before school starts but it's so hard to get motivated. I mean a 2.5 gpa is pretty good right? it takes hard work to get a 2.5. Parents just don't understand what its like.

      Because of the Reagan tax cuts, our economy was booming. Clinton inherited that growing economy but after years of his economic policies we were in a recession when he left office. That recession continued into the first part of Bush's term, until Bush's tax cuts that he got passed early in his term began to take effect in the economy. Even after 9/11, which should have hurt our economy even more, our economy came back because of the tax cuts and is now the fastest growing economy the US has had in 20 years.      Saudi Arabia is one of our allies in the war against       . Granted, not the most perfect ally, as many terriorists do come from there, but the government is officially and more and more practically aiding us in that war. The government is against Alkaida and working with us to defeat them. Clinton allowed China, which is a communist regime, to get a hold of military documents, which will give them the ability to improve their weapons technology and use it themselves or share it with other countries like North Korea. That sounds like treason to me.      People who think Bush lied before the war in Iraq are believing a lie. The findings of committee that investigated the events that led up to the war found that Bush did not lie or coerce the intelligence community (CIA) to exagerate or stretch the truth. The CIA just simply didn't have accurate information which probably would not be the case if when Clinton was in office he didn't cut the CIA's funding. But the inaccurate information the CIA had still could be found to be accurate. There is allot of desert in Iraq to berry weapons of mass destruction and Syria is right next door. Very easy to have sent them to Syria to hide them. Why would Sadam have risked losing his power and trading his palaces and wealth for a hole in the ground and an 8x8 prison cell if he had nothing to hide. hmm?      There is a big difference between Clinton being told by Sudam that they knew right where Osama was and did the US want him and Bush aggressively going after Osama immediately after 9/11 and pledging not to stop until we've got him.

      I watched the end of this tv show last night on mtv and it was called "Your Face Or Mine." What it was is two people on stage look at holograms and pictures of other people and the audience votes on who is better looking the picture or the person on stage. Then the person on stage has to compare themselves to the picture and guess which one the audience guessed as better looking. Then they would bring the persons best friends and have a boyfriend come and compare which one was better looking the     friend or her best friend and he had to guess which the audience guessed was better looking. They got up to $3800. And at the end of the show it said REMEMBER TO WATCH NEXT TIME TO SEE MORE EGOS LOWERED AND MORE RELATIONSHIPS RUINED. What the heck is that!!!! People on tv comparing who is better looking for entertainment. How horrible is that. They stand there and make fun of how other people look on tv for fun. Everyone is beautiful no one is better looking than anyone else. We are all made perfect by God and I can't believe the dissrespect that we show towards God. Not by just making fun of the way others look but also by putting ourselves down. I can't believe how bad our world is getting.

      Just last week I went to a church camp called camp Bethel that is located in the big horns. I had tons of fun running around and hiking and playing games, I expecially liked playing paint ball. I will never forget this week of camp... not because of the games or because of the friends I made but because of the decision I made while I was up there. I had realized that I had two personalities. 1 personality was a good Christian kid   who loved God with all her heart and the other was a bad kid   who acted like God was one big joke. God says He can't stand look warm water and that He will vomit you if you are look warm. I was look warm and I didn't want to be. I wanted to be just one person. So I had to choose. Did i wanna be happy following God or did I wanna have fun and be miserable following in sin. Well I chose to be happy and follow God. So As soon as I got home I threw away all my bad cd's and movies. I threw away my ciggarettes. First I confessed everything to my parents and God and asked for forgiveness and for their trust. I'm already so much happier.  I had to explain to my friends my decision and told them I might not be able to hang out with them for awhile until I get stronger and figure everything out. I'm not sure if they understood or not but I hope so. I hope that after I am strong enough I will be able to come back and hang out with them without having the temptation to go back to my old self. I am very thankful for my counseler Spokal for offering to be my accountability partner and helping me through these changes.
