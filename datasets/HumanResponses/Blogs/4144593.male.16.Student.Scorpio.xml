       i'm nv in the mood to study .... wat should i do ???    My stoopid little sis.. woke mi up at 8 all cuz mom went to the market n she had to go to sch... So i had to escort my little sis to sch half-awaken...  Went back to sleep.. woke up at 10... hurried through my stuff and dashed out of the house. Met ed back at sch... They were having their java test... Met them n went to play badminton Saw carol (at least i tot it was her) practicing wif her team...  Played until 4... asked ed to go wif mi to Heeren he said he was too tired... so changed the date to tmr. Had a shower n took a cab home. Too lazy to take bus.  Found out i had too much time to spare nothing to do so i fooled around wif my blog add this add tt linked my frens blogs then removed them. Added audio to the blog but dunno y i'm the only 1 who can hear it. Nvm I think i uploaded onto the client side instead of the host sever so only i can hear it. I try to do it properly next time i'm so free...  Hiyah just not in the mood to study leh.. everyday iz like tt   Ash,ed - plz leh i dun like tt varin lar hor ... so stop spreadin crappy rumors... this joke is seriously overboard.

Half way through the leture, didnt understan anything so i look around the leture room just to pass time. Saw tt a fren  was cryin... i think she was too stressed out. Wanted to say a few words to comfort her but changed my mind at the last moment. Nothing good ever cum out from my mouth... Dunno wanna say anything to make her more upset....

      Late for sch this morning, reached sch at 8.30 was 30 mins late Luckily tina tan was teachin matrixs all noe liao so nvm, rest of the time of the leture was sleepin and doing my organic chem tutorial.  Next up CEP, nite-mare has cum....... Stoopid mr soh dun tell us the marks first. Say wat noe marks liao no 1 listen to him teach.He dun say the marks every1 even more anixious,no feelin to study. Anyway he said a lot ppl failed. Predicted tt i was 1 of the ppl who failed. Then he went through answers. I think i got nearly everything in the front wrong. During break i really tot i was gonna fail cuz i seemed to get everything wrong. Every1 tot i was being a hypocrate or being humble but i really tot i was gonna fail. After the break when he flashed the answers for the last few qus,i suddenly felt i may pass..... in the end i passed the test. Guessed the last 3 qus saved my sry ass. Did not get really good grades but i guessed i'm just happy to passed cuz a lot of ppl failed the test very badly.   Went for lunch with the guyz and teikjun. Teik jun left halfway while we were eating dunno why.......... he just left like tt.... we were very sure we did not offend him in any way...guessed tt he was feelin down due to the CEP test. Went to the lab next,did the tutorial.... luckily i still got do tutorial 3 and 4 cuz of the test. But i did not do tutorial5 so i was sleepin when he was teachin it. But i guessed i understood everything so it's alrite. Did not do the lab cuz mr roberts blur....... I stayed back after every1 left cuz some of the stuff i forgot save in the diskette so i had to write it in myself. Then dunno who said i stayed back cuz i'm suppose to teach steph today...and i was like HUH ???? AM i even suppose to teach today .... I been really forgetful recently so if i'm suppose to teach today, i'm sry tt i forgot and i had to go off cuz i have something on. Then again I dun even remember sayin i'm gonna to teach today... Some1 plz tell mi wats going on....

       Forgiving some1 does not change the past.... however it does changes the future for the better ....    Woke up surprisingly early today, dunno why dun ask mi. Spent the morning shopping for groceries for mom as i did not help her yesterday. Omg she had to choose today to buy the rice. It was 10 kg and i had to carry it home, not to mention tt i oso had to carry the canned food which were oso very heavy. Reached home very tired, abandoned my plan to go for a morning swim. I still dun understan why she won't get dad to go with her. Dad had a car so he could just dump all the stuff into the boot and drive home. But everytime she just igores my grubbles by sayin dad's tired or busy. Like i'm nv tired or busy.......   Went to hougang mall to have lunch as mom was cookin too slow and i has to teach steph today. Took a mrt to the place we were suppose to meet. Boarded the train and sat down, called edmund only to find out he was oso at kovan mrt which was my next mrt stop. We were both heading the same direction so i figured we could meet on the train. The train stopped at kovan n to my surprise i met lulu be4 i even saw edmund. Apparently both of them were headed towards PS.Met edmund next, all three of us best pals were chatting on the train until my stop came and i alighted. I went to the control station where i was suppose to meet steph. Couldn't see her anywhere so i checked my fone to find i was 15min early. Was bored and i started walkin around the station cuz the there is this officer who's checkin ppl's bag at area near the control station and he was lookin at mi as though i was carryin a bomb or wat. Went into the shop inside the mrt station, forgot whether it was guardian or watson or watever. Brought somethings to eat to pass my time. Waited and waited, i got a little scared tt i got the wrong meetin place and starting wandering around the station lookin for steph. I guess it's not only unconvienient for a person not to have a hp but oso unconvienient for their frens.  Finally when i returned to the control station i saw steph and she was lookin so nerdy i almost can''t help laugh.... (sry steph if ur reading this but u really looked nerdy) She was carryin this big adidas bag and in her hand were the yellow book and the math textbook. I guess it's my fault cuz i told her to bring watever she could. Hmmm now i feel really guilty bout it. So sry .... Anyway she was also gettin worried tt i got the wrong meetin place. Anyway we walked to a nearby mac and started studying. Taught her organic chem, a little CEP , a little math (realli A LITTLE) and the labreport. She actually realli smart, she can understan concepts so easily. I'm realli worried tt i'm a lousy teacher or wat but i guessed she made mi look good. I so worried tt she did not understan wat i'm sayin but she just faked tt she noe so tt i wont feel bad.Anyway finish teachin her and went home. Suppose to be going go somewhere with edmund but i was realli tired and wanted to rest. Guessed it was quite sometime ago tt i realli had to worked my brain so hard. Well nothing much to do for the sat nite so i guess i gonna surf a while and turn in a little later. -bye-  Edmund - tmr go out leh, sry today cannot go out, got thing wat.... Best pals Steph - So today i teach u the things got any use??? hope tt i was able to help lulu - long time nv comment liao, muz comment k ??? but dun be like edmund ... so vulgar.

       When u start askin urself WHY?, u lose all faith in miracles........ Forget bout watchin the news, make news urself.     CEP CEP CEP i hate CEP, CEP sux ..... Omg i so gonna fail CEP. Really, not joking, it's real. I'm not tryin to act dumb or stoopid but i'm really failing it. At the way things seem to be going i feel i so gonna fail. I feel so depressed rite now, i regreting now tt i been slackin too much realli. I regret bout so many things but i realli cannot make myself change my lifestyle.I cannot even survive this semester how can i survive the next, biochem and all the stupid modules tt got to do with biology. I dunno a shit bout biology (well except the chap on reproduction) ... But actually i been thinkin too much ... i dun even think i can survive this semester. Must work harder liao.  CEP test today, sure fail so lets fast forward to after tt. Went for lunch at north canteen, the moment i walked into the canteen i saw this gal in pink colour sweater and immediately i noe tt it must be tt Varin liao. Wat luck, of all the dayz, god had to choose this day for mi to see her. Wanted to act like i didn't see her(not very freindly even to some1 who u don't like; yeah ppl i noe) and moved on. Tough luck, ashley and edmund were seated next to her and they were much more attentive then the blur queen. They called my name so i had no choice but to turn around. Apparently all eight of the ppl seated there were my frens. They asked mi to join them but i rejected them. It's not realli nice to pan sei the guyz n beside tt varin was oso there. so i moved on and sat with the guyz. Ate chicken rice,omg it was so funny, i finished my meal n all the rest of the guyz were still queing up for their yong tau hu. Com n it lesson next, i called edmund as he said he was free and wanted to cum to the leture to tok to mi. But when i called him, he was already playin pool at AMK. Slept through the boring lesson. Next up CEP, already fucked up with the subject liao so i just slept through it and tok with the gals a little. I dunno if i'm just too sensitive or wat but i feel like i'm always left out. Went to play table tennis next. Played until 6pm and called edmund again. Wanted to ask him out as i had nothing to do for the evening. But apparently school of business had their graduation cermony today so they  had the day off. He was already at cine liao, i was a little pissed at him for not tellin mi earlier.  Went home after tt, at the interchange, i saw this very very long queuefrom the interchange to the mrt station. Tot some1 was giving away free gift so i went in front to see wat was going on. In the end i had to join the long queue cuase as things turned out, tt queue was for bus 72 which is my bus home.   Edmund- wah u very vulgar leh.... u tio affected by ashley liao ...... Today u pan sei mi huh win liao lor ..... Ashley - wah liao who ask u tell weimin bout tt gal 1 ... u noe he nearly spilled thing out in front of my classmates ...... lulu - bo liao lock ur bloc ......

       i dunno why i typing this but i'm just doing so..... i feel lost i feel hurt i feel exhausted   Woke up late (yes i noe again) had to rush to sch, but reach sch only to find out i'm actually early by 10 mins. Sat at the bench in front of the toilet saw amin n started a converstion. When through another stupid tutorial. Stupid mr soh had to miss another 1 of his lessons so we spent 2 hours at the sports hall. Reached the sports hall to find a empty hall except for 1 court.Guess who's playing my best pals edmund lulu and ashley. So the entire sports hall had like 15 ppl and it's like the whole place nos mi. I guess i'm well liked.-lol- Played badminton, table tennis and squash. Poor sean, the squash ball hit his head with maximum impact..... i think the head blue black liao  Then went for kampong's semester project lesson, was crap since i  literally enter the class room said everything was in a CD-rom since he got no labtop to see my presentation n left. Went to play table- tennis  again second time today. The guyz really liked sports man...Had another crappy lesson for Pd suppose to perform for the class. Tot every1 did not do the thing so i heck care with sean but turns out every1 so hardworking. only amin,jane mi and sean no group. but jane n amin join other groups leaving mi and sean hung out to dry......Win liao lor every1. So when every1 was performing i was writing a scribe. Took mi only 10 mins to finsh the play. Acted it out with sean, was quite a sucess consider the fact tt i did not write my lines had to think of wat to say tt very moment. Surprisingly i was not anxious or anything. My last min play even got compliments from jocerlyn. Went to library after PD. Sat there with sean while we waited for the rest. Weian and the other guyz came. They sat down and started tokin. It  like i was invisible and they were chatting between themsleves. They were so nice as to invite to sit somewhere else so they can tok bout some private stuff. I feel left out by them lor. Anyway dun wanna tok bout it too much bout sad stuff. Cya guyz till like sunday..... my com spolit i lazy to use the laggy 1.-waves two hands - _________________________________________________________________  steph- dun think too much hor ...... n yeah u wanna noe wat happened ar,  tell u in private here a lot ppl can see.......  Edmund - dun post crap, i've not forgiven u for today just yet .........  lulu - i still think my blog better than u ...........

       i feel like the rock tt has been weighting on my heart has vanished ....    Went NDP yesterday, had learned the lesson from sunday. So we decided to reach kallang stadium earlier. It proved to be another stupid decision by edmund cuz we reach there only to be grilled by the afternoon sun. Sat rite at the last row of the yellow section. Dun wanna tok bout the parade since most ppl would have seen it on tv already. So let fast forward to the fireworks !!! Yeah i lov the fireworks.  But since we were in the last row, the marshals gave us umbrallas to sheild us from the fallin fireworks. 4 of us had to squeese into a small pathetic umbrella so niao gu. But the wait was worth it, the fire works were great, much longer and nicer than the fireworks on sunday at marina. Got quite a number of photos of the fireworks, my photoshootin skills not veri good but i guess they r passable. I love fireworks............

       Sunday 8-8-04      U were given life by ur parents, how u choose to live it iz up to u ..........     Woke up surprisingly early in the morning, guess i cannot sleep cuz my mind was preoccupied with somethings. Cried over some things in the nite but dun worry guyz it's all over now. Sry if i am emotional or blank out this past week. Anyway i wanted to use the afternoon to do my labreport but some things cropped up and i ended up helping some1 else do their labreport. I'm not really blaming tt person or wat, in fact i wanted to thx the person for just tokin to mi .... I wasn;t really in the mood to do any work anyway considering the things i had to do later in the afternoon.  Went out at bout 3.45 to meet some1. Had to do something horrible to some1. Did not intended to hurt any1 but i guess i had no choice wat so ever. To the person involved if ur reading this , i'm sry i had to do tt to u. It's just tt our hearts are just now beating in the same rythem. I sincerly hope tt u will find a heart tt move in time with u and mend tt abyss trail of destruction tt i have cuz.   Went to meet edmund, doreamon and kel later.I was 15 mins late. Then as if heaven was playin a bad joke on us, we had to wait for 35mins for the stupid bus. The bus reached the area around the concorde hotel and then there was a severe traffic jam arounf the area. We waited for 15mins and the bus mearly moved a few inch. I got fed-up waiting and i went downstair with my frens. I guess Mr paul tan my former com skills leturer was rite singaporeans are idiots. The blind follow the blind and before long all the ppl seated at the top deck came down to complain to the bus driver. Aparrently most of the ppl in the bus were like us, chasing against time to get to watch the fireworks. The bus driver gave in and then he opended the door to let us out. There were like 10 buses behind us and then every1 started alighting.... I guess singaporeans are idiots. Recieved a call from my fren already there sayin the fireworks gonna start in 5 mins time. We ran and ran desperatly trying to get there in time. Every1 around us were oso running. We reached the overhead-bridge near suntec when we heard the first rounds of the fireworks going off. It was kinda of nice sight watchin fireworks from a overhead bridge. After the first rounds went off, we ran again like madmen. A few other rounds of fireworks went off, WE paused to look at the fireworks everytime we heard the sound. Lucky we reached there in time for the last round of fireworks. Captured a image of the last round with the esplande in the foreground and the fireworks in the background on kel's digi cam. The pic was really nice. I gonna upload it into my blog one of these dayz when i'm more free. Then we just stood in front of the esplande while the whole crowd started to disperse. We went to marina square intending to grap a meal but it seems a lot of ppl had the same intentions. So we left marina for raffles link, again it was so crownded tt we could hadly manuvear in the crowd. Decided to walk to bugis then. We walked as we tok bout life generally. Then lulu recieve a call from jian hui's gf telling us tt jian hui who was oso watching the fireworks had fainted. All of us were laughing like hell since jian hui was well known for being physically fit. Then lulu start acting how jian hui would look like if he fainted. Our dinner at Mc was constantly interrupted with calls from jian hui's gf updating us info bout Jian hui. went shopping at parco after tt. Left parco for home at bout 12.

       The dead do not feel anything , it's the ppl who are alive tt suffer................   Went PS with edmund, ashley and lulu to watch The Village. Brought the tickets for the 4pm show, had 2 hours to waste away so we went to LJS for lunch.I was about to dip my fries into the chilli when i saw something black among the red in the chilli. Ash said it was probebly the skin of the chilli however i was not so sure so i threw away the packet of chilli and avoid eating the fries tt were in contact with the chilli.  Waited a freaking 20 mins for the show to start. Had thought the show was gonna be real scary. But as thing turned out it was kinda more funny than scary. I really love the show, it was simply great. Must have been the best show i seen this few months so far. The plot was great, the show had it's funny moments n of course the scary parts too. Dunno wanna spolt the show for u guyz by telling u bout it. Anyway there was this scary scene where i was practically hiding my face behind my bag. Wasn't really tt scary but i'm really scared. Well i have to admit i'm timid. I stongly recommand every1 to watch the show. It was really great, though some ppl may find the ending a little too ....... Anyway it's just night shala(dunno wat) style. I really loved all his movies, especially the endings. Went to play LAN after tt, was just taggin along as i don;t really like playin LAN. Went to play pool after playing LAN. It's propebly like the fifth time i'm playin pool this week liao lor. Really sian liao but since all my frens are going i dun wanna be a spoilt-spot. We played 9 ball pool n omg i rulez man. I was not really in the mood to play so i was just hitting the ball for fun. All of the ppl i played with are really pros but somehow i keep winning n winning. I was bloody lucky, i can't believe my luck even until now.  Generally had a real fun day but my stupid brother had to spolit things. He spilt water over my Labtop n my labtop is now spolit. I was so fucking angry with him. I can't do a shit with my computer rite now. I'm only left with a crappy useless ancient computer tt is so bloody laggy to use for the rest of the week. How the hell am i suppose to do my lab report n semester project on such a fucked up com. ASHLEY quickly finish upgrading tt other computer so i do not hav to use this craapy com or my labtop any more. I really pissed with my bro rite now, using my labtop to surf the net without my permission and then spoliting it. Wat right does he have to use my computer. I Paid for the com using my own money from my bank account. He did not even pay a single cent,not to mention the fact tt i have to pay for my monthly internet bills myself. FUCK HIM man i gonna give hell tmr morning.     I apologize for my babaric way of describing my bro but i really pissed with him n i'm just not feelin well

       The most important things in life are the things without form... treasure it ....  Friday morning ..... i just love Fridays ... it symbolises tt the long hard week is soon to be over .... with the added advantage of being able to wake up late.  Spent the morning shopping with mom for groceries. Went to NTUC fairprice n she brought the neccesities for the next week. I had to carry so many bags of stuff until i sian. Then return home turned on my computer found tt i had nothing to do. So bored until i tried sleeping n i just could not sleep.,slept too much already. Check my wallet found tt it was empty n so i went to ATM. fourth time this week liao, already took out $130 so far this week n then i still hav to see movie with ashley tmr.OMG i going broke, my weekly pocket money iz only $50 i spent $130 liao how am i going to survive the month.   Went to bus stop, again exact same thing happened as yesterday. The bus had to run away the moment i ran to the bus stop. Again i did not chase the bus cuz i planned to be late anyway. So i waited for the next bus to arrive. Went i boarded the bus, i heard some1 called out my name. So i looked around n saw kelvin(from my class not K.L or K.G). I went n sat next to him, apparently he was trying to be late too. For two consequtive dayz, i wanted to be late, missed a bus, boarded the next bus n some1 from my class is on it. Maybe it a divine sign telling mi i should be late more. We chatted on the bus n then he came to the topic i feared. BOWLING SCORE FROM YESTERDAY.  Reached sch, found out tt every1 all did not went for MR SOH's e-learning. Had another session of crapping e-learning for com n it. Then we has lunch at south canteen, saw ya-ling and the gals. They were buying bubble tea, then i was joking bout wee kiat to Hui-ni. Anyway for the ppl who dunno, wee kiat iz the Ex of hui-ni n i just happens to noe him n we hav the same name. Then went to have lunch, n guess who i saw, Wee kiat n he was lining up at the same bubble tea shop. Went up to him n chatted for a while. Asked if he saw hui-ni, he said no. Well i guessed as much cuz he was flirting with a pretty gal next to him (as usual). Ate lunch n went to Com n it leture. Sean n siyan slept while wee leong weian n i chatted bout anything n everything. Time flew so fast n be4 we knew it , i was Mr Soh leture.For once I understood everything he said(well now i believe in miracles) . But tt stupid fadhil had to spolt things the very first time i really understood mr soh. Fadhil started reminding every1 i was suppose to strip today cuz of the stupid bet we made yesterday. He was irritating mi until i did not catch anything from mr soh. Anyway for any CEP students who are reading this, a good advice for u. If u dun understan wat mr soh teaching nvm just go read the yellow bible (u noe the book u brought) . Helps a lot.  CEP lesson ended n it time 4 hell. The guyz wanna strip mi in the leture room. Luckly most ppl left liao except our class ppl n mr soh only. I had no choice, i was the one who agreed. Well i hid behind a pillar n ...................................................................... Luckly the gals who saw were angela n carol from b2 . Otherwise i dunno how to face the world.   End of sch n we went to play table tennis n badminton. Badminton fully booked so we played table tennis. Played for a while saw a court in badminton was empty n we ran to it. Played for a while then the advanture club ppl needed to use the space for something so we returned to playing table tennis. Sean left for swimming, siyan left for kendo. Only left the three extra talkative 1's. Then a gal asked if she can join us. Being gentlemen(at least i was, dunno bout the other 2), we of course agreed. The two of them took turns to play with the gal. Could see tt they were hesitating to smack cuz afterall we r playin against a gal. Played until 8 pm then we went to shower. Showering after exercise feels so great. But once again the blur side of mi have to resurface. I only remember tt i did not bring a towel after i finished showering. Had to use tissue paper instead. Weian was even more funny, i nv seen a person who can shower without getting his hair wet except him. His reason.... he did not want to mess up his hairstyle. Left sch at 8.30, must have been the latest i ever had. Then had to walk the underground(sort of) passage way which links the sch to the mrt station. It was so bloody dark ..... so scary.... u could not see wat in front of u. Weeleong was complainin bout the sch being cheapskate. Left sch went to terminal n took a bus home. Well i guess tt a nice end to my hectic 5 days. Hope the weekend is much better although i noe sunday gonna be a real hell of a day for mi. Cuz i noe some1 gonna get hurt cuz of mi. Anyway i just wanna hav as much fun tmr with ashley, edmund , doreamon n kelvin low as possible. Cya guyz tmr .......   Doreamon aka lulu - ur blog sux lor mine iz a lot better.... how dare u say mine sux ..... go bang the wall lar

       5/8/2004      This is the first time i'm using blogger.com's blog so if my blog suxs plz tell mi so ....     Always thought i was good at using the com.... just found out today my html skills was not tt good after all. Got a problem with the links part. Hiyah too long nv design webpage liao forgot all the commands. But nvm since all our frens lists are like similar edmund (hehehehe) u noe wat to do hor .... just copy the source n then send mi.I will add my own fren's links myself.         Woke up late this morning, did it on purpose; wanted to skip first part of the stupid lesson. I actually planned not even to come to school today but the guyz seemed intent on going bowling so i just came along. Reach the bus stop only to see my bus ran away ..... not so stupid as to chase it since i planned to be late -wahahahahahahha-. Waited for a very short while then another bus came so i hopped on. At the bus stop after mine fadhil came onto the bus. He saw mi n sit next to mi. We chatted a while bout my personal problems n i felt much better after talking to him. After a while Leon(tt guy from our orientation with the lame jokes) came on and he identify fadhil n i so he came to chat with us, talked bout life in sch, stuff going on in SCL, how the MB ppl cut their mouse, movies , pool, bowling and generally life. Then while we alighted at the bus stop near the sch, we started tokin bout tt stupid YapB.T n how gay he iz. We were laughing like hell bout it.  Plough through 2 hours was crappy S.P in which i slept half the time n spent the next half tokin. Went FJ next to have breakfast. Ordered mixed vegetable rice n rocky mountain. Ate less than half of the rocky mountain cuz i'm too full. Weian n sean were complain bout how mi n wee leong r wasteful. Did not really catch wat they were saying cuz i was looking around the place 4 her just in case she's around. Had my swelter hood prepared just in case she's around. Went to play badminton next, Walked there n then back again cuz i did not bring my pass. In the end had to borrow ya ling's pass to enter the sports hall. Played badminton with the guyz... had so much fun making a fool of sean n wee leong by making them run all the around the court to chase my shots *lol*. Then siyan the pro had to break up the fun. He told them my weakness n then i started losing. Weeleong and sean just won't let mi rest as they said they wanted revenge. I guess wat goes around cums around.  Went bowling next. The first set every1 was like bowl for fun. The second set then every1 started gettin serious (well actually every1 but mi). Not really in the mood to bowl so i just any how throw. Then tt said the loser has to strip so i got serious in the last set in order to catch up. In the last set i finally got serious n well i got back my normal standard.I got 4 strikes n then every1 was shifting their attention on weeleong cuz now he got the lowest score. I extended my lead by bout 20 . I got caught up in the wee leong thing n then i started bowling like crap again. Making funny shots and stupid actions. But omg i can't believe it man Weeleong Caught up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the last 2 bowls he suddenly on form!!!!!!!!!! I started to panic n then my throws became worse. In the end overall i still got last. Think i lost to weeleong by 4 points overall. I Can't believe even now man.   After tt we went to eat n then play pool. Not in the mood to play so i just any how shoot.... Luckily i didn;t got trashed. Whoa i now then noe i so pro sia anyhow shoot oso can win other ppl. LOL Went home after tt. Had a good sleep and then now here i n complain bout life.......  Note: EVERY1  Plz do not tell tt irritating VERIN bout this blog i change blog just in case she noes my last blog..... SO DUN TELL HER!!!!!!! _____________________________________________________________________________________  Fadhil- thx a lot !!!!
