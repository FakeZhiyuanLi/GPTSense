      March 31, 2004  Today was another doctors appointment. The blood work was a breeze! But my sugar is way to high! So I have to go back on Monday for more test!!! A normal pregnant woman is around 140 and mine was 193!!! So they are checking me again to see if I have Gestational Diabetes. I did eat a lot of sugar the night before so I am hoping that is why my level was so high! The next doctors visit is 4/19/04 I am excited because Jack will be going to that one! :)

      March 26, 2004  TWIN WOW!!! The doctors appointment was a breeze and so exciting! I was able to hear the babies heart beats and they were so healthy! They both are measuring at a good and healthy size. I will scan the pictures of the ultra-sound in when I get a chance over the next week. Still not a lot of morning sickness (thank goodness) and I feeling OK. I am praying that everything goes smooth!! I go back Wednesday for all the blood work! (yikes)

      Today is my first big doctors appointment. I am very excited to hear our little one's heart beat.  We found out we were expecting on March 8. It's very exciting for us but also very scary! I plan on using this space on the web so all my family members that I don't speak to daily can see how the 3 of us are doing! :)    Hugs, The New Mommy to be.

      April 29, 2004  Hey everyone! I can not believe that April is only 1 day from being over! Crazy how fast these months fly by as I get older. I am still doing really good and feeling great. I felt the babies move for the first time Tuesday night. As my friend Cindy said it just felt like a bunch of champagne bubbles move in my stomach. It was very exciting! Of course after about 5 minutes I was ready for them to stop because I was trying to get to sleep. I am still not having any odd cravings and really not showing a whole lot other than the (.) top half of my body!(.)  I am going to try and get a picture this weekend from the side and you all can judge as to how big you think I am getting. I have found something very odd - since becoming pregnant I can't stand Extra gum and now I can't stand the taste of it! Very odd! I would think Gum is gum, but not with me! I am starting to get the 2nd trimester headaches they are annoying, but I can live with them.  Take Care everyone!

      April 24, 2004  Just checking in and to let you know I am doing good. I have had a few hard days this week, but nothing I can't handle! :) I puked the past two days but afterwords I felt fine. I am still not showing a whole lot but I guess I should be thankful because when I do start showing I am sure I will be huge! Not much else new is going on. Jack and I are doing great, I have only wanted to kill him once! Hormones I tell ya!  Ok More to come next week.

      April 19, 2004  Today Jack and I went to the doctor! It was exciting because we heard both heartbeats and see one of the Twins move his/her arm and the other moved his/her leg. The first heart beat was 180 so we are calling him/her the football player because that was a little high, but nothing to be concerned at this point. And the other's heart beat was around 160. The football player was moving all around they were both very active this morning! :) The doctor said I am doing great and he was very pleased with my sugar testing results that I have been doing daily. I no longer have to prick myself every day so I am happy about that! I only have to test twice a week 4 times a day! And at this point NO INSULIN!!!! So I am doing everything I need to be doing. He did tell me he wants me to start SLOWWWWWINNNNNGGGGG down! So tonight while doing housework I just did a little bit and then would sit down for awhile and then do a little more. I think this will work out best for me! Next appointment is on May 17th and I will be 16weeks so just maybe we can find out what these little ones are! :) OH I hope! Thank you all for your prayers, emails and cards! You don't know how much they mean to us!

      April 15, 2004  Tax day! Do you have your taxes done? Just think this time next year our Tax Break Babies will be here! :) Yesterday I went and seen the dietitian and to be honest they did not tell me anything I did not already know! Both of the woman I seen said I really didn't even need their service and in fact they only charged my insurance for 30 minutes vs. the 2 hours they would have! I credit everything I was able to tell them about carbs/measuring food/food groups to  urlLink Weight Watchers ! I believe that everything I had learned while on Weight Watchers prior to getting pregnant helped me understand everything. I just wish I would have ate "healthy" the entire 12 weeks instead of thinking, "I'm pregnant it's a free for all" But I know better now and I am eating healthy now and choosing very healthy choices! So I know that diet will help with the diabetes!  Mom came over yesterday and helped me clean my house! And it has never looked better! THANKS SO MUCH MOM!!!! Jack walked in last night and said he felt like he was walking into someone else's house! We made a promise to each other to keep it that way! So hopefully mom that will save you from having to come up and doing it all over again! :) Thanks again! We love you!!!  There will most likely be no more updates until at least Monday night. We are going to the doctor on Monday so I am sure I will have lots to share after that! I am excited because Jack is going (this is his first trip there) so check back Tuesday for some updates! :)

      April 10, 2004  I am feeling great! These past two days have been nice- I have not felt sick at all. Of course I worry because I think "something" could be wrong since I don't feel sick. But I know deep down that everything is A OK! My eating as been going very well, I haven't been able to track a whole days worth of meals just yet, but I am getting closer each day.  I am having trouble with my sleep I work these dumb 12 hour days and when I got home at 7am I am up by noon and can not go back to sleep. So then when I come to work I can't keep my eyes open. Thankfully my co workers don't mind if I cat nap! :)

      April 5, 2004  I went for my blood work yesterday and today I got a call from my doctor today and the nurse asked me to come in so I knew right then it was bad news! So I went to see them and sure enough I have Gestational Diabetes. So this is what I will be doing to help it out. I will following a very restricted diet (2000 cals a day) and working out. If I am doing good by the next visit then I will just follow the diet through the rest of the pregnancy, but if my level haven't improved then I will start insulin shots, so start praying that everything works out for us. I am going to follow this diet closing and walk as much as I can because that last thing I want to do is take shots everyday!!!! I go see the dietitian on Tuesday so I am looking forward to some meals that she comes up with.

      April 2, 2004  I should note that the "thing" above Twin #2 head is called a yolk sak and the doctor says it will go away. I have had a lot of people emailing me asking. Thanks for the concerns.

      May 28, 2004  Just a quick update... I am still feeling very well and I am finally starting to show! I have been having heartburn very bad recently, but I have found that I have it worse when I eat spicy foods so I have pretty much put those types of foods off limits! I have not felt much of movement lately, but I am sure in the next few weeks I will start feeling them moving. I can't wait until June 14th! That is when the big ultrasound is! I just hope we can find out what they are! If not both at least one! I am ready to start buying things for them!!! I don't think it's hit me that in less than 5 months we will have 2 babies with us 24/7! Jack will make comments like, "we better enjoy sleeping in like this because in a few months we won't get that chance." or he will say, "just think this time next year we will have 2 little ones laying here watching tv with us." I am pretty sure he is excited! :)  I have been checking my blood pressure and sugar and so far both are really good! Tonight my blood pressure was 121 over 79 and my sugar has not gone over 100 all day! I also have been getting 20 minute walks in this week which I think is making a huge difference because I am not as tired while at work! OK that is a wrap more hopefully next week. And I will try to get some photos up of me soon!

      May 17, 2004  Today's Doctors appointment was a great one! We heard the babies heartbeats and they both were strong and heatlhy! Baby A was between 135-140 and baby B was 140-145 I haven't gained any more weight and my blood pressure was OK. They did blood work to test for down syndrome. I go back in 4 weeks for the BIG ultrasound! Hopefully we will find out what they are then! Boy/Girl - Girl/Girl- Boy/Boy I think Jack is praying for a Boy/Boy but I will not care as long as they are both healthy! :)  Alrighty that is all I have for now... Take Care!

      June 22, 2004  They are both GIRLS! And both are healthy and measuring right where they should be for 22 weeks. Twin 1 weighs 1 pound 2 ounces and Twin 2 weighs 1 pound. So we already have a piggie! :) I had mom take a picture of me last night so as soon as it's devloped I will post it and I will post the ultrasound photos as well. Twin 2 had her mouth opened in one of the pics! It's so cute!  Jack and I got stuck in the elevator going up to the doctors that is something I will never forget! And a story I can tell the girls. It was so scary! I am still not up to writing the "book" about what happened last week but I promise I will soon!   Hugs!

      June 19, 2004  Sorry I have been MIA-  Well I ended up back in the hospital and having my gallbladder removed. The 3 of us are doing much better and the pain is almost all gone from the surgery. It was the very scary and something I hope I never have to go through again. (surgery that is) Jack was wonderful during the whole thing. I don't know what I would have done without him. There is so much more to the story, like why they couldn't wait to take it out until after the babies go here, the fact that I was in the hospital from Wed. morning until Monday afternoon and many, many other things. But right now I don't have it in me to sit and write everything so I promise once I get 100% better I will. I just wanted to let everyone know I was OK! And we weren't able to find out what the babies were either. We go to the doctor on Tuesday so hopefully I will be healed enough for a full ultrasound! Thanks to all of you that sent flowers, cards and prayers. You all are the best! Love ya!

      June 8, 2004  Yesterday was the most eventful day I have had since becoming pregnant. I was in the hospital from 06:00 to 18:00 last night. I was having very bad stomach and back pain Sunday night but it would come and go. I ended up paging my doctor and he instructed me to go on bed rest and drink lots of fluids. He said if I didn't start feeling better to come into the hospital and he would meet me there. I thought I could make it through the night and would just go see him once his office opened however, I was up all night in pain and around 04:30 I couldn't stand it anymore so I asked Jack to take me to the ER. I ended up being sent to the birthing center since I am so close to 20 weeks they hooked up all the monitors to the babies and myself. They could not find one of the babies heartbeats for nothing. The poor nurses tried everything! (and I was scared that something was wrong) I was having very mild contractions but nothing to worry about it. Our doctor finally arrived and they did an ultrasound to ensure both babies were fine. They both are fine alright! Baby A was doing flips! I am not kidding! Jack and I were AWE...that baby was just flipping around and moving like crazy! Baby B is the lazy one he/she just laid there and would kick it's feet every now and then. We seen their legs,arms, noses and mouths both had solid heart beats and were doing great!   The doctor said he wanted me to have an ultrasound because he suspected I had either a kidney infection or gallstones. Come to find out I indeed have gallstones! I started feeling much better after I ate the liquid lunch they provided me. The very mild contractions were due to me being dehydrated. The doctor also checked to make sure my body had not tried to dilated and it had not! (shew!) So I will watch my FATTY food intake and will continue my 2000 calorie diet. We will take the gallstones out after the babies get here (unless they continue to cause me problems which he doesn't think will happen) The doctor also told me I had the gallstones prior to getting pregnant and that I didn't know until now because of all the changes my body is going through.   We still don't know what they are, but hopefully will find out on Monday! Jack was hoping he would see boy parts yesterday while they were doing the ultrasound, but he didn't see anything! So hopefully they will both show us what they have come Monday! :)   There you have it- the latest on the 3 of us! Take Care!

      Starting today I will be on bed rest.&nbsp;   My cervix is getting to short so complete bed rest is needed.   I will not have a computer because ours is in our basement so until we get it moved or I get a laptop there will be no more updates.   Take Care all!

      I posted a new picture of me! It can be viewed  urlLink here   It was taken at 26 weeks and 2 days - I don't really look pregnant I just look FAT!&nbsp; But I guess that is the way I will look since I was over weight to begin with.   We finally went and registered Saturday! We hit  urlLink Babies R Us ,  urlLink Target , and I just got done with  urlLink JcPenny's .&nbsp; Why so many? Because each store had things different that we wanted.&nbsp; I was really disappointed with Target because they didn't have hardly anything! We went to the one by the Dayton Mall. So I am trying to get things updated online.&nbsp; JcPenny has the bedroom things (beds, bedding, changing table etc.)   I went to the surgeon today for follow up after my surgery. Everything is fine and I healed just the way I should have!&nbsp; Hopefully I never see that nice man ever again! :)

      Yesterday marked 26 weeks! I can't believe how fast this pregnancy has gone.&nbsp;   Both of the babies are moving around a lot more now of days! But they aren't hurting me yet so I don't mind it one bit! Jack felt one of them kick his hand the other night.&nbsp; This is only the 2nd time that he has been able to feel them.&nbsp;   I am still feeling really good and my sugar has been GREAT!&nbsp; I plan on having a picture up of me by next week, I just need to finish my roll of film and get it developed! (I know I need to get with the times and get a digital)  Hopefully Jack will buy me one before the girls get here! LOL   Saturday we are finally going to register! Jack has had to work the past 4 Saturdays so he got this one off so we are headed to Babies R Us and Target! (maybe Walmart to b/c there isn't a Target around us and most of his family don't get to Dayton that often)   Until next time...

         Man work is getting harder and harder! I work 12 hour days (for those that don't know that already) and it's starting to take a toll on my body! So I plan on getting a doctors note and will start 1/2 days hopefully the week of the July 28th.&nbsp; That would make me work from 18:00 to 00:00 which won't be back at all, but I know that I will want to do those hours when I come back! (If I can only find a way to have Jack see it my way)  &nbsp;  My sugar was GREAT yesterday and I feel like&nbsp;I ate very well!  &nbsp;  Babies are moving like crazy right now! Their kicks are getting stronger and stronger! I can see my hand moving when I put it on my stomach.&nbsp; Just amazes me!!!! Now if they will just let their dad feel them kick! It seems like every time he tries and feel them they stop kicking!  &nbsp;  I am looked online all night last night for things for the nursery I just can't decide what I want yet. So hopefully when we go to Babies R Us I will get a better understanding of what I&nbsp; want because I will be seeing things in person!  &nbsp;  OK~ Until next time....

      Today marks 24 weeks and 6 days!   Doctors appointment went very well. Both of the baby's heartbeats were strong and healthy. Twin A was right around 150 and Twin B was around 145-148. I am going to predict that Twin B will be Gracie (the smallest)   My sugar has been good for the most part, It was very high a night or two last week, but the doctor said it was most likely something I had ate. And the night that it was very high I had tried something new!   NO bed rest yet! I am happy, but also sad because I am ready to stop working!!!! I did get the OK to talk to my boss about going to 8 hour days vs. 12 hours! My Doc said he would write a note if need be, but he sees no reason to pull me off work because I am doing so well!  He said I am doing better than most singletons!  (meaning a woman carrying one baby)   Next appointment is in 3 weeks- I did gain quite a few pounds in the last 3 weeks, but he said that is normal and we will keep a close eye on my weight from here on out. I have gained 20 pounds so far since becoming pregnant!! I am still counting cals, but have been slacking about writing things down, so today I broke out a old Weight Watchers food journal and have wrote down everything I have ate!   Mom and I went shopping yesterday and bought the girls TONS more clothes! I swear they won't ever wear the same thing twice! The spare bed is now covered completely! We are looking for a closet type thing to put in their room so we can start hanging things. I can't believe all the stuff we have already because there has not been one shower yet! Both Grandma's are the type that buy them outfits every time they go into a store!   OOPS I wrote a book :)   Later

      July 6, 2004  We are doing good! I am feeling just fine, but finally pregnant! My belly is growing my the hour I will try and take some more photos tonight and post them soon. I hate my hair right now so they will probably be just belly shots from here on out! (sorry)   Jack felt one of the babies kick last night! They were going crazy and he finally got to feel one. We were laying there talking about them and I one of them knew it! :) I am pretty sure I have said what the names will be, but last night we decided that the smallest one will be Gracie Lynn and the bigger one will be Hannah Paige - I can't tell you how excited I am for these sweet girls to arrive I know I will be go through all types of emotions from being tired to not knowing what to do, but I just can't wait to hold my babies. Jack and I talk about nothing else right now other than what it's going to be like when they get here! We can't wait! Next appointment is a week from today! I can't wait to hear the heartbeats!   Until next time-

      Today I went to the doctor... Baby A's heartbeat was 154 and Baby B's was 160.  He did not measure my cervix (he will do that in 2 weeks)  but he is remaining postive that the meds and bed rest will get me to 34 weeks, and we are hoping for 36-37!!  Not much else is new... 2 gals that have blogs online recently have had their babies. Congrats Lisa and Candi! I would link their blogs, but you have to have a password.  I am headed out now to update my website with some new pics so you might want to check them out. There are new belly shots! :)

      Yesterday I had a little scare!  I monitor for contractions twice a day for one hour. Per the doctor I am only aloud 8 in one hour. Well I had 6 around 2pm and then at 7pm I had 9! I could only feel them when they were long, but they didn't hurt. I had counted 5, but when the nurse called me back she said she had seen 9. So I gave myself a "extra" dose of meds and rested for a half of an hour and put myself back on the monitor and that time I had 6 which I only felt 2 of them. So I was much happier.  This morning I only had 2 and they were MILD! So I am hoping when I get back on the monitor in a few minutes I will only have a few, because I don't want to go through that scare again!  Thank goodness my mom didn't mind coming a hour away to sit with me while Jack was at work.  :) Later

      Today is 29 weeks!  I just can't believe how fast this has gone.  Our girls   could   be here in less than 2 months! I am hoping that we can make it to at least 36 weeks which would be the week of September 29th.  But 37/38 weeks would be much better! Twins are considered full term at 37 weeks.  We still have a lot to do before they get there.  My mom and Grandmother have started painting the room. I love the color!!! Jack picked it out and he did a great job! It's a green color almost a lime green but not totally lime.  Now I just have to pick out the theme that I want to use. So far that has been the hardest part because I can't get out and see what the stores have so I am just  looking online.  Mom bought the dresser last night I can't wait  to see it! I  trust her judgement so I let her get what she thought would look best.  Last night my two of my dearest friends came up to visit! It was so nice sitting around and talking! So far everyone that has came up has been here to clean or paint! Thank you so much Bev and Shannon for spending time with me! And thanks for all the wonderful food!! Jack and I loved it all!  It is so nice out today I hate that I can't go outside and sit, but I am not suppose to sit up for longer than 15 minutes at a time and that is really pushing it. So I save the sit up time for when I eat.  I feel really good and both babies are moving! Not hurting me yet just moving around a lot. My upper tummy is big and hard! I will try really hard to get a new pic up soon.  Take Care!

      Hey Everyone! I am finally back online! Work was able to provide me with a laptop! So I can stay in the bed but be online! It's very, very slow because it's still dial up- but I will take it! Hopefully we can get a wireless router installed in the next few weeks and I will be back to normal.  I am feeling pretty good! I have indigestion very bad after I eat almost anything! It's starting to be a pain, but if it's the only problem I have the rest of the pregnancy that is fine with me.  I am hooked up to a pump which is in my upper leg -  it pumps meds into me every hour and then a stronger dose every 3 hours. I also hook up to a contraction monitor twice a day for 1 hour. I send the data to a medical center and then they call me back and let me know if I had any contractions. So far the most I have had in one hour is 3. Last night I had 1, but the nurse said she seen a lot of movement from the babies!!! They are moving, but not hurting me yet. It still just feels like really big bubbles right now.  Next appointment is on Aug. 16th. Bed rest isn't "killing" me yet I think I am getting on Jack's nerves bad! It's a good thing I love watching TV! Otherwise I would be in trouble!  OK that is an update on us.  I will try and updated again soon!
