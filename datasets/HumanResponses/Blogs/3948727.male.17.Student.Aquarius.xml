       Well I decided, after reading a couple of other journal entries, that I would not only a sports journal, but I might as well do a journal about me. I live in a really small town in Michigan. Our high school, unlike normal schools, has grades 7th-12th in one building. And the number of kids in the building?? Only about 750, yeah I know, really small. usually in my spare time I hang out with my friends. Couple my friends are Randy, Ellery, Ronald, John, and Matt. Well anyways today was kind of a boring day. I went to my church from 1-3 p.m. There was this girl visiting there and I had no idea who she was. I had seen her before but I still didn't kno her. She in the row across from, was it on purpose?? Maybe, but i'm not sure. I tried to glance over a couple of time while during to see if maybe she was glancing back. I could of sworn that once or twice I saw her lookin back. But was she lookin at me cuz I was lookin at her?? I don't know, but i'm not too worried. After the service had ended I walked up to Randy and Ellery. I didn't have to say a word because they already knew what I was thinking. I asked them if they knew her, they said never saw her before. I really wasn't in the mood for trying to go and talk to a girl I don't know, mainly because she looked a little young and she was with her mom, and for some reasons me and parents don't get along very well. So the whole sitiuation ended with us waiting outside, she walked by and said hi to us, we said hi back, and we were left wondering where this mystery girl came from came from. Afterwards I went home and turned on the tube(sportscenter of course). That was pretty much the most exciting thing of today. Well until tomorrow or whenever I feel like posting.

       Well I guess my greatest fears were realized Sunday. Tiger Woods finished the British Open tournament with a final score of -3, putting him in a tie for 9th place. I guess now I might as well admit it. HE'S IN A SLUMP. I hate to say it but it's the explanation. He did have a fighting chance though. Until his abismol performance on the back 9. He only managed to get ONE birdie, just terrible. I don't know what to think anymore. But I have to give big ups to Todd Hamilton for winning. Even though I have to say that I&nbsp;never heard of him before today.&nbsp;At least other tiger's are doing well. The Detroit Tigers, after their 4-2 win Sunday, have beat the Yankees 4-3 in the season series. I know it doesn't seem like much especially since it's only midseason. But come on who would've ever thought that the Tigers could beat the Yankees 1 game much less 4!! Ivan Rodriguez is absolutly MVP so far this season. He has turned the Tigers around. Granted they're still no New York Yankees or Boston Red Sox, but they are still surprising a lot of people including me. If you ask me they look like the Florida Marlins of last year. Can you say World Series?????? Ok maybe i'm jumping ahead to far. Of course i'm a hard-core Red Sox fan, but a little part of me, that little part that goes for the home team, would LOVE to see the Tigers in the World Series. But thats in the future and we have to wait until October. Have you been paying attention to the Tour de France?? I have to say I really have been paying attention. I'm one of those people who love to see records getting broken. And the fact that Lance can get his 6th Tour de France title!!!! I may not understand cycling but I understand that winning a 6thTour de France in a row isn't easily done. Probably because nobody's done it. Lance Armstrong is definitly one of the best athlete's in sports today. All the stuff he had to deal with including cancer, it's just insane to think how this man can keep this up. Well I wish the best of luck&nbsp;to you Lance, hopefully you'll come out on top. The only other news I have is that Vlade said that he is&nbsp;most likely to end up in L.A., let's hope so. Until I get more on that story i'll leave it alone. But thats all for today and until I have more to report on the sports world.

       Nothing really new to report in the world of Laker land, besides for the fact that Kobe went to L.A. to meet his new teammates. I think that it was a very good gesture, considering all the criticism that Kobe takes for being selfish and only thinking about himself. All the players say that they're happy to play for the Lakers, but then again who wouldn't be with a franchise like the Lakers. They say they want to bring showtime back, we'll see about that. Meanwhile&nbsp;in other sports news, at the British Open Jonathan Byrd has the lead by 1 stroke, but guess who's hot on his trail, Tiger Woods of course. Tiger's only 4 strokes&nbsp;back from leader Jonathan Byrd. Now I am the one of the few people who says that Tiger is NOT in a slump. But....if Tiger doesn't win the Open I might just be proved wrong. It doesn't make sense to me really. I mean how can a man who's won so many titles at such an early age, and look like he's gonna break Jack's title record, all of a sudden just drop off from existence. I hate to say it but it all started when he got married. I'm not really trying to say anything but it's true. They do say that a women can be a big change in a man's life. I don't know though, maybe i'm just thinking to much of it. Maybe Tiger will win the Open and the next 4 tournaments after that. I know it sounds unlikely, but hey it is Tiger Woods we're talkin bout here. Well I guess we'll just have to see tomorrow after the final round. Hopefully Tiger will be holding the trophy high and laughing at all his adversaries who said he was on the "Slump". Let's just watch and see. Well thats all I have to report for today. Until I get more stuff to write on.

       Well it's been a couple of days since Shaq got traded to Miami, i'm still not to sure what to think. Being a DIE-HARD Laker fan I wanna believe that we can survive without the big-man.I mean Kobe Bryant is argueble the best player in the NBA, but he's still not Micheal Jordan. MJ won championships without a center in the middle but I have a bad feeling that Kobe can't pull that feat off. So the question is who got the better end of the deal? The Miami Heat or the L.A. Lakers? Looking at the rosters Miami only really have three good players, Dwayne Wade, Eddie Jones, and now Shaq. And really Eddie Jones isn't a star player, but he's still decent enough to get the job done. Also pressuming that Pat Riley gets more support around Shaq I can see the Heat prolly making the Eastern Conf. Finals. But then you have to consider that Shaq has to be in shape and healthy the WHOLE season, not just part of it like he was with L.A. Now let's look at L.A.'s &nbsp;side. Kobe Bryant at shooting, Payton at point, Odom at power, Butler at small, and BRIAN GRANT at center. Maybe it's just me but having Brian Grant in the center does NOT make you a powerhouse. Even if they go out and get Vlade, he's still not the center that he used to be, and he definitly doesn't compare to a Shaquille O' Neal. Now the conference difference. Shaq has been moved to the Eastern conference, thats bad news for the rest of the east. You can quote me on this, "Shaq will start as center in the All-Star game this year." It's just about a guarentee. Look for his numbers to go up TREMENDOUSLY from last year. Not only does he have to worry bout sharing the spotlight with Kobe, but also the points. I see Shaq averaging AT LEAST 28 points per game. Consisdering that then I would predict the Heat to be one of the top three teams in the East. Now taking a look at the Lakers in the Western Conf. and all I can think of is who's gonna be the top draft choices for the lottery, because it doesn't look good at all. With everybody in the west upgrading with more firepower, and some teams stayin the same(Spurs, TImberwolves) Chances of them makin playoffs are slim to none. Unless Kobe can prove all the critics wrong and play like his idol, MJ. But again it's a fat chance of seeing that happen. So when it all boils down to it I guess you could say that the better end of the deal went to the Heat, that is until Shaq gets old enough to&nbsp;where he he's not a dominant force. And believe me that time is coming soon. Well thats the sports&nbsp;news for today, be back when I find more intersting sports news.
