      aaaah shit.. cant belief what i wrote juz now was gone???? dammit this computer and webby... fuck.. i guess i gotta write em again... well here goes nth ......  Haiz.. sunday... its quite a good day today.. played two matches and lost the first one by a lil margin but won the second one like we are the god of cs.. man.. those pros really SUCKED.. we pwned em 13 - 2 like what??? Nak made up for my bludner during the first match as i wasnt really concentrating.. the second match we had EM , brian , zhi hao and those other pros as our opponents.. but we still managed to win.. haha.. we are the supreme!!!  Talked abt the possibilities abt us as frenz last nyt wif zh.. its quite scary how time can make frenz break up and make enemies.. how tym can make us realise what we did in the past are dumb things.. scary.. now i finally realised that i hav to cherish what i hab and not what i dun hab.. im now trying to cherish my family and frenz.. its no point crying and getting sad over things that are not meant to be urs.. ur gonna lose lotsa time... but i still cant help feeling sad.. but hey.. theres always an alternative right?? (how i wish that is sooo true...) gotta go now.. cya peeps

      haiz.. 14 aug 2004.. the date where i finally gathered enough courage to express my love for her thru sms (didnt have the courage to call her) i think she ignored my sms cos she didnt reply. Maybe frm today onwards we will not talk to each other... (i hope not.. haizz) i think im so dumb.. to tell her that i like her when it is shown so clearly she likes someone else.. i just had to get it off my chest.. i did feel a little better than but now i regret telling her that i like her. this maybe the ending of our fragile friendship.. haiz.. meeting zh later to walk round 201 to get over her.. but i know it will not work and i think zh is the oni one who can accompany me thru tis.. i think i'll be gay if the blow is too hard for me.. haha (juz kidding la) hope we still can be friends even though she doesnt fancy me.. I still like her though... haha.. blog some other day ba.. Adios ~ :+: HoPeFuL :+: bB^rAnDy :+: HoPeFuL :+:
