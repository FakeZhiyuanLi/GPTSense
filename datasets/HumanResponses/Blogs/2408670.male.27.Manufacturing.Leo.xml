						        Vilfredo Pareto  was an economist who is credited with establishing what is now widely known as the  Pareto Principle  or  80/20 rule . When he discovered the principle, it established that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. Later, he discovered that the pareto principle was valid in other parts of his life, such as gardening: 80% of his garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods.    Some Sample 80/20 Rule Applications  :  - 80% of process defects arise from 20% of the process issues.  - 20% of your sales force produces 80% of your company revenues.  - 80% of delays in schedule arise from 20% of the possible causes of the delays.  - 80% of customer complaints arise from 20% of your products or services.  (The above examples are rough estimates.)   So, it is possible to solve 20% cause of 80% of all your problems in life. Isn't it? Well, it's worth to try, but what are those 20%, ya?

						       Tommorow, 20 July, sixty years ago, a group of German Army officers conspired to assassinate  urlLink  Adolf Hitler  . One of these officers is   urlLink Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg  , then he was Chief of Staff for Home Army Command.   On 20 July, 1944, Stauffenberg, a German count, planted a briefcase containing a bomb under an oak table during a meeting at Hitler's Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia. Stauffenberg was whispering something indistinctly as he left the room as if making an excuse. According to historian Joachim Fest's Plotting Hitler's Death, just after 12.40pm there was a deafening explosion, throwing all 24 people to the ground, some with their hair in flames. Hitler had just leaned far over a table to examine a map and his chair was torn from under him. His trousers hung in ribbons from his legs and as he stumbled to his feet one general took him in his arms and cried: 'My FÃ¼hrer, you're alive, you're alive!'   But Stauffenberg, climbing into a getaway car, had seen a body covered by Hitler's cloak carried from the barracks on a stretcher and concluded his mission was accomplished. All day rumours spread that Hitler was dead. But that night, with the dictator back in control, the conspirators were executed by firing squad. When the squad took aim, writes Fest, Stauffenberg shouted: 'Long live sacred Germany!'

						   This is probably the first posting on this blog,  the beginning . That was even the first sentence having the first letter which was 'T', and this is the second&nbsp;sentence (*STOP IT, will ya!*). Maybe the right thing to do before starting a blog is to set the objectives, so after contemplating, I've come up with several good reasons:    one more channel to publish myself (I really need to be published)  some place where I can put down my thoughts about the past, present and the future  link ups with bloggers out there   General theme of this blog place is personal thoughts, my past, my future,&nbsp;my stories, my passions: historic events, The Prophet, great statesmen, books, ladies,&nbsp;etc, etc. The storytelling will be mainly in English but maybe sometimes in Indonesian, just to have the right thoughts put down with mother tongue language. The bloginning is just a beginning, so&nbsp;there's gonna be much much more, you can bet on it!
