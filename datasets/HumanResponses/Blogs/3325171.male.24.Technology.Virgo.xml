      POINTS TO PONDER   1. Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll  squeeze those dangly things  and drink whatever comes out?"    2. Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken there... I'm gonna eat the next thing  that comes outta it's butt."   3. Why do toasters always have a setting that burns the toast to a horrible crisp, which no  decent human being would eat?   4. Why is there a light in the fridge and not  in the freezer?   5. If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares,  why is there a song about him?   6. Can a hearse carrying a corpse drive  in the carpool lane?   7. If the professor on Gilligan's Island can  make a radio out of coconut,  why can't he fix a hole in a boat?   8. Why do people point to their wrist when  asking for the time, but don't point to their  crotch when asking where the bathroom is?   9. Why does your OB-GYN leave the room  when you get undressed if they are  going to look up there anyway?   10. Why does Goofy stand erect while  Pluto remains on all fours?  They're both dogs!   11. If Wile E. Coyote had enough money  to buy all that Acme crap, why  doesn't he just buy dinner?   12. If quizzes are quizzical, what are tests?   13. If corn oil is made from corn,  and vegetable oil is made from vegetables,  then what is baby oil made from?   14. If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons?   15. Is Disney World the only people trap  operated by a mouse?   16. Why do the Alphabet song and  Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star have the  same tune?   17. Stop singing and read on..........   18. Do illiterate people get the full  effect of Alphabet Soup?   19. Why do they call it an asteroid when  it's outside the hemisphere, but  call it a hemorrhoid when it's in your ass?   20. Did you notice that when you blow  in a dog's face, he gets mad at you,  but on a car ride, he sticks his head  out the window?   21. Does pushing the elevator button  more than once make it arrive faster?

       urlLink   Naughty gnomes made to cover up  Wed May 12,11:17 AM ET 	  BARNSLEY (Reuters) - A man has covered up his lewd garden gnomes with painted-on swimwear after police warned him he faced arrest for causing public offence.  	   While most garden gnomes fish or enact scenes of bucolic tranquillity, ex-army sergeant Tony Watson's models in Barnsley, South Yorkhire, bared their breasts and buttocks, prompting complaints from the public.  "It is an offence to display something that is insulting or likely to cause distress," a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  "Although some people view the gnomes as a bit of harmless fun, we have to take complaints from members of the public seriously."  One of the gnomes now sports a polka-dot bikini, said local resident John Threlkeld, who passes the gnomes every day on his way to work.  "Tony used filler and paint to cover them up," he said.
