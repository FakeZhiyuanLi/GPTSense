       Rex Morgan MD = SWASS!  All the time I've spent talking up Marmaduke, I completely forgot to mention Rex Morgan.  I know this is a comic that you all skip past because you starting reading the comics page as a kid, and Rex wasn't funny.  You need to get past that.  Rex is all about the drawings.  Screw the story.  There's always at least one frame that is a genuine work of art.  It would make  urlLink Roy Lichtenstein  jealous.  My favorite in this one has to be the last panel.  It's got action lines.   urlLink    this is what you've been missing!&nbsp; urlLink

       Here's one for everyone in the Twin Cities  I don't want you guys to feel left out.  The Twin Cities is a seriously swass place.  Plus, you guys can claim Prince as your own.  Now some of you may not think Prince is too swass.  But seriously, look at this picture and tell me  urlLink the man  isn't  urlLink solid .   urlLink    Here's a picture of Prince playing the guitar so fast it's smoking.&nbsp; urlLink

       HELP!  The computer I'm using whack.  So lately everytime I go on the web, a gazillion pop-ups come up.  They never stop.  It's gotten to the point that I spend more time closing those windows than using the page I want to.  And no, I'm not on the porn pages.  Also, lately it won't let me download any pictures.  That one really stinks, since I just learned how to post pictures.  Can someone tell me what the eff is going on?

       Who's That Blogger?  So apparently there's this blogger that goes by the name of  urlLink Rance .  This "Rance" is supposedly an A-list actor, but no one can figure out which one. Go to the site, see if you can be the first to unveil him. Or stay at this site, and bask in the swassness of the Gutte. Okay, so my computer sucks right now and I can't get the picture to work, but trust me, he's looking mighty swass.  Hopefully it'll be up tomorrow.   urlLink    Could this be the Gutte's Rance disguise?&nbsp; urlLink

       Another Accomplishment for the Swass Report!  I'm taking this thing to a whole new level.  For all of my illiterate friends, I give you pictures!  For all of my computer illiterate friends, I think you smell bad.  It's not like they'll ever know.  Freakin' caveman hippies.   urlLink    bang the drums and drink champagne!

       I'm going to make all of my friends look bad.  I've decided that in my spare time I will be working on an art series.  I will call it "Bad Paintings of Good Friends" or maybe "Bad Representations of Good Friends"  because while they may look like a deformed version of them, the painting itself may actually be pretty cool.  Then I will get them in a gallery and sell them.  Once sold, the owner will put it up on their wall where visitors will see it and say,"Damn he/she's ugly!  Who is it?"  And the owner will say,"A friend of the artists.  He only knows ugly people."  Maybe this isn't the best idea after all.  But there's only one way to find out, by doing it anyway.

       Are Homeless People Spies?  I'm pretty sure that at least 2% of all homeless people are high-to-mid level spies.  You know how you see one that seems out of place every once in a while?  It's like, why would a homeless person hang out here?  Because he's got no home? No! Because he is spying.  I saw one today in Santa Monica that had to have been a spy.  I was polite though, I didn't blow his cover.  I also didn't give him any spare change because we all know spies make good money.  Maybe I'm wrong, but if I am, the CIA should hire me because this is a great idea.  Everyone tries to avoid eye-contact with bums, so what better way is there to survey a place without anyone noticing? (the answer is none.)

       I have to take a trip to the zoo!  I recently read that koala bears get drunk off the juices of the eucalyptus leaves.  When they get drunk they fall off the tree.  I have to see this.  I want to know: when they shake off the fall and get back up, do they stumble around and make lewd gestures?  I hope they do.

       Who is Mitchie Brusco?  That is the question I have asked the greater Los Angeles area for the last two days.  And quite frankly, I'm a bit disappointed in the population.  For a town where everyone wants to be an actor, how is it that they're all camera shy or completely uncreative.  Especially since I tell them to just make it up if they don't know who he is.  I'm giving them complete creative control.  Something one doesn't often get in this city.  There were a couple of good ones though.  My favorites had to be : a Jewish Carpenter that died for our sins (way off, but funny), and the artist that draws Marmaduke (ok, I told her to say that one but I still like it).  I'm working on a very slow connection, so you'll just have to look up everything that should have a link the hard way.

        urlLink DDR  vs.  urlLink McDonald's   Dance, Dance Revolution is doing all it can to get kids off their lazy asses and exercise.  So much so in fact, that some schools are making it a part of their gym classes.  That's way better than getting pelted in the head with a rubberball, by some 5th grade behemoth that already has to shave everyday.  However, in fear of losing customers to healthy habits, McDonald's is starting to offer DVD rentals at select stores.  Not only encouraging you to sit around all evening in front of the TV eating junk food, but you also need to go back to return the DVD.  And how many people will be able to go back just to return the movie?  You know they're going to be leaving with a Big Mac or two.  And since they've got the food, it'd be nice to have something to watch wouldn't it?  It's a terrible cycle that's about to be unleashed.  DDR, we need you now more then ever.

       32 Hours in 2 Days  That's what this weekend actually turned out to be for me.  Unfortunately, that's 32 hours of work.  Clocked in 20 hours on Saturday and 12 on Sunday.  So much for relaxing and reading the Marmaduke comic.  I did manage to celebrate the counter turning on Friday though.  Also, the work was long, but it was pretty cool.  It was a short film, heavy on FX (mostly head wounds).

       Counter Breaks 100!  This is cause for celebration, even though half of those hits were me trying to see if the adjustments I was making were working.  And the other half were probably me checking to see if the counter had gone up.  Even so, it's the weekend and I plan on celebrating this tonight.  Then I'll have to work off the hangover on Saturday. Sunday I'll get the Sunday paper and check out the  urlLink Marmaduke  comic in full color.  That's pretty much my weekend plans.

       The system is up  Not only are the comments working smoothly, but I've added a section called " urlLink places I go ".  It's pretty self-explanatory.  It's on the right side of the page, and I suggest you go to these places as well.

       Hassle the Hoff!  Yo, yo, yo!  Peep  urlLink this news , straight off the net.  Ice-T is has a new student:  The one and only David Hasslehoff!  T has high hopes for his protege.  Apparently he's going to surprise us with his rap skills and humour.  The extra "u" comes courtesy of the British paper this report comes from.  For the Hoff's sake, I hope T is teaching him to rap in German.

       The System is Down!  So in all of the re-configurations, the comments section is not working.  Meaning 1) Sarah Blain is safe until they come back up.  and 2) You can still guess what I ate that day and win a prize.  If you really think you know the answer you can also email it to me at johnnynothumbs1@hotmail.com.  If you win I'll post your name and the winning answer for everyone to see.  Now I got to get back to the system.

       Maroon is the new Orange  I've attempted to update the look of The Swass Report, but couldn't get the orange back.  My sure-fire method of typing "orange" into the template code just doesn't seem to work anymore.  So long live maroon!

       Win a Prize!  I'm feeling generous today, so I'm giving you all a chance to win a prize.  So here's how:  Guess what I ate for lunch today.  Yep, it's that simple.  However, anyone that had lunch with me today is exempt from the contest.  The first person to correctly guess what I had for lunch will recieve a personal phone call from me, telling you how smart and awesome you are.  So if you win you'll probably want to record this conversation to use as proof of awesomeness against those who may doubt you.  And the action of taping it will prove that you're smart.  You may also recieve an autographed picture of my lunch, if I feel the conversation merits one.  So don't be boring.  Onto a different subject.   urlLink Sarah  has still not posted a comment, check back here tomorrow with your pizza orders ready, as  urlLink time is running out  for her.

       The Future's so Bright, I gotta wear shades.  No Hoj, not because of  urlLink atmospheric ozone degradation .  Although that is a problem.  It's actually because of a band I saw last night.  Their name:   urlLink The Like .  Last night they showed me that the younger generation isn't all bad.  The band is composed of a bunch of high school girls, and they rock.  It's nice to see that they're not all swooning over  urlLink American Idol stars  or  urlLink Britney Spears .  It makes me happy, which normally I am not, because of the whole I have no thumbs thing.  Also playing last night was  urlLink Ben Lee .   urlLink The man  was mellow last night, but still pretty  urlLink solid .  For the last song, he added a drummer which brought the energy up.  I wish the drummer would have been there for the whole set, but the show was free so I really can't complain.  If you're in LA, The Like has a residency at  urlLink Spaceland  for the rest of the month.  So they play a free show every Monday of May.

        urlLink Kudos  to CJ!  Congrats on the  urlLink 1K post , and the reconfiguration of blogger.  In honor of this  urlLink solid  accomplishment I give you  urlLink this .  Now on to more important  urlLink matters .  For all of you in the Kansas City area, I recommend heading to the Barnes & Noble to get your comics signed by  urlLink the man  that draws Marmaduke,  urlLink Brad Anderson .  And while you're there I suggest taunting some geeks, for old times sake.   urlLink Adam , I had my pizza order ready, but  urlLink you made it  just in time.  So on to the next.   urlLink Sarah Blain , post a comment or let the phone ring!  You have until Thursday, the 20th.  Last note, with some shoddy  urlLink Sir Jay -style research I've come to the conclusion that he's probably a cross-dresser and huge  urlLink Bea Arthur  fan.

       False Allegations  While I'm very happy that the comments section seems to be picking up steam, I feel I must set the record straight on a recent allegation.   urlLink Sir Jay  seems to believe that I do not exist.  That I am merely a pen name for  urlLink Randy .  That is false.  Randy doesn't even own a computer.  I make fun of him all the time for it,  urlLink and so should you .  If you still don't believe me, ask  urlLink Stew-pac .  He was there when we all met in Providence.  He can also attest to the fact that I have no thumbs.  Next time your research should be a little more  urlLink solid , before you start throwing around rumors Jay.  By the way,  urlLink Adam McKibbin , you have until Tuesday the 18th to post a comment before the phone starts ringing.  If you don't want to be  urlLink the man  delivering pizzas I suggest you try it.

        urlLink Spaceland ?...More like SWASSLAND!  For all of those that missed the show at Spaceland last night, I pity you. (which I know was all of you, as I went alone.) For they were serving up swass by the gallons, or in those Hardee's  urlLink Smurf glasses  if you asked politely. The first band of the night was  urlLink Tsar .  And these guys are  urlLink awesome !  Straight up rock and roll for the masses.  I'd give them 2 thumbs up if  urlLink I  had any.  The second band was pretty awful, and didn't even say their name, so I can't tell you not to go see them.  Unless you want to avoid all bands from Seattle.  Which I don't recommend.  The last band of the night was  urlLink Ambulance Ltd .  And the swass was back.  These guys are  urlLink solid .  Another note on the night, was that the Eve 6 singer kept walking around acting like he was all cool.  To which I kept walking up to him and saying, "Dude, you're not cool."  But  urlLink the man  is as  urlLink dense  as  urlLink osmium  so he didn't really take the hint. The singer for Tsar however, was the swassest person I've seen in LA for a long time.  Just how swass is he?  He wore a cape after the show.  That's right, he walked around the club the rest of the night with a cape on.  But not just any cape.  A cape with a large picture of  urlLink David Hasselhoff , with the word Hasselhoff written in large white letters next to the face just in case you weren't  urlLink German  and needed some help.

       I Can't Believe it's Come to This!  I went through all the trouble of putting a comments section on this page, and no one is using it. The whole situation's got me about 10 minutes to  urlLink Wapner .  Now I'm not computer savvy at all.  I was excited that I was able to change the background of this page to the lovely shade of orange you're basking in right now.  So making this whole comments thing work was no walk in the park.  But I thought that you, the readers, would enjoy a little personal interaction.  Then I realized that no one probably read this thing, so I had  urlLink Randy  email you all and extend a friendly invitation to come to my page.  Still no comments.   urlLink So here's the deal .  If I do not receive a comment from you, I shall post your phone number on this page and request that all of my readers call it and demand that you give them a pizza in 30 minutes.  They shall continue to call until you either a) bring them a pizza in less than 30 minutes or b) post a comment.  Yeah right, you say.  And to that I say,"Mr. Jay Aaseng, I'm starting with you.  You have until Monday the 17th to post a comment, or let the phone start ringing."  You see  urlLink Randy  starting blabbing away once you give him a free drink or two (or  urlLink 12 in this case ).  So start your posting!    urlLink CJ  is exempt, since he's  already posted. And so is  urlLink the man .

       Solutions I tell you!  That's what I bring to the table, so stop asking.  Now what solutions do I bring to said table you may ask.  Well, are the walls in your apartment boring?  Then I give you the  urlLink Rasterbator . This bad boy will take any photo and let you blow it up huge.  Now if you're overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of such an endeavor, let me make a suggestion:   urlLink The Man .  That's right, a nice big picture of Steve Guttenberg to greet you every morning.  What could possibly be better?  Nothing, except for maybe today's  urlLink Marmaduke .  Which was solid as usual.  I highly suggest you stop reading this drivel and check it out.

       Solid!  That my friends, is what I think of  urlLink Marmaduke .  Which by the way, did you read today?  That Marmaduke cracks me up.   urlLink The man  that created this strip should be given some sort of medal, or trophy (his preference).  It is perhaps the benchmark of what all comedy should strive to achieve.  Not just comic strips, but all comedy.  In fact, I demand a Marmaduke movie.  That's right all you  urlLink big shot Hollywood producers .  Listen to what the people want.  We want to see Marmaduke in our local cineplexs.  The people also seem to complain when a  urlLink favorite   urlLink cartoon character  is CGIed.  I agree,  we don't want to see a CGI Marmaduke.  What we want is the Gutte dressed up as Marmaduke.  That's  urlLink box office paydirt .  I'm laughing already.  To all you doubters, the Gutte's got the range to play our favorite canine friend.  I don't really have proof on hand so you'll just have to trust  urlLink me  on this one.

       MSN Asks:  urlLink Can Bowling Shirts be Hip Again?   NO! No, msn they cannot be.  The main line in question is  urlLink Nat Nast .  A line that is run by the titular man's two daughters, who's only involvement in the company up to his death was in the shipping department.  Which only lasted one summer I may add.  MSN decides that these shirts are "cool" because Larry David and Ted Danson fought over one on TV.  And while Larry is funny and Ted has sweet hair plugs, neither is really known for their trendsetting wardrobes, or trendsetting anything.  No, if you want to be at the pulse of everything hip, you pay attention to  urlLink the man .  That's right the Gutte.  Not only was he the man in the Police Academy movies, but he also held his own against a  urlLink gay robot  in Short Curcuit and the  urlLink Olsen Twins  in  urlLink It Takes Two .  Now sure he's taken some time off, but he's also a member of the  urlLink Stonecutter's , and the honorary mayor of the Pacific Palisades out he in California.  And if you don't believe yet, just read his  urlLink induction speech .  I personally enjoy where he wants to rename Sunset Boulevard and put his dog on a stamp.

       Look at my pants!  It's like I just got off work at the swass factory.  Oh, and at this so called "factory of swass", they give you Gmail accounts.  Which you use for mail.  Though not the really important stuff, since   urlLink Google   "the hereto unnamed swass factory" scans the body of all your messages.  Also, just because your leg is broken, you don't need to freaking scream into your cell phone on the bus.  You ruined a perfectly good bus-riding experience.  On a new bus.

        urlLink COACHELLA   urlLink !!!  The uberfest in the California desert.  The Swass...  1.  The Flaming Lips :  Anytime you start a show by  urlLink walking over the audience  in a  urlLink giant bubble  your off to a good start.   2.  The Rapture :  Quality all around, but I hold a special place for the guy that rocked out the cowbell like there was no tomorrow.   3. The Pixies :  Reunited at last.  They came to rock, and rock they did.   4.  All the bloggers I hung out with :  These guys know how to party.   5.  The Girls at the Water Booths :  These girls were so hot you enjoyed spending two bucks on a bottle of water.   6. Del and the rest of Hieroglyphics :  Highlight was Del's freestyle verses during Clint Eastwood.   urlLink The man  has more flow than a sorority house at that time of the month.  And now the SWUNT...  1. Beck :  Seriously, the best part of his set was when he stopped playing and tried to get his reprogrammed Gameboy to work.  If I had nails in my pocket I would have shoved them in my ears.   2.  The Dude in the Silver Speedo : The desert was hot, you are not.  If I had those nails, I would have wished I saved them for my eyes.   3.  The Shirtless Old Guys :  Smantes are not a thing to be flaunted.  They were about as cool as The Hoj and Stewmanji combined.  So keep the shirts on unless you have a sweet tattoo of a tiger that covers your whole chest.   4.  The Trash Cans :  If you going to invite 80,000 people to one spot, you might want to put out more than 5 trash cans.  I haven't seen that kind of  urlLink mess  since my kitchen in college.   5.  The Squatters :  These people would stake out a spot early on and not move so they could be close when Radiohead or The Cure came on.  The result was the first 10 rows of people sitting for all the other shows on that stage, which really drained the energy of the bands before them.  People, there are 80 plus bands playing, go broaden your horizons.  Frickin' wierdos.  They had me about 10 minutes from Wapner during the Hiero show.  That's all I really have to say.  Anything else wouldn't do it justice.

       King of Swass  I cannot take credit for the creation of swass, that belong to one Mr. CJ Bonifas.  I will however, keep you all updated one the swassness of various people, places, and things since CJ has his hands full seperating the crap from the science and then rearranging it to a managable format for those of you that just don't have the time to do it yourself.  CJ your work is appreciated by all that like both  urlLink science and crap  but are just too lazy to go out and look for it. I shall soon report on the swassocity that was the desert uberfestival of Coachella.  Stay Tuned.

       Goth Elvis!   Also known as, why in the crap hasn't anybody told me about this yet?  Seriously, this is what seems to be the coolest thing I've ever found by reading a book.  And by reading, I mean flipping through and only looking at the pictures.  Now we all know where Robert Smith got his make-up from, and where KISS got their costumes.  Elvis is now officially cooler than ever.  I want to know what music he was making during this phase.  All that accompanied the picture in the book, was a long list of all the drugs they found in his blood after he died and what they do.  If I wanted to know about drugs, I'd read a drug book not a rock and roll book.  How in the heck did the editor let that slip by?  I want answers.  And capes with pictures of Goth Elvis on them, but mostly I want the capes.   urlLink    Seriously folks.....AWESOME!&nbsp; urlLink

       Technical Difficulties....to the Extreme!   The recent lack of posts is due to a serious computer malfunction.  It seems as if I need a complete overhaul, so things may be sporatic for a little while.  Luckily, a good friend let me use his computer to put this up.    On a happier note, I went to see  urlLink The Ponys  at Spaceland last night...FOR FREE.  So to all you sucks who paid to see them at the Troubadour tonight, I'm better than you.  Not that I wouldn't pay to see this band.  They were great fun.  The lead singer is like a really tall pogo stick, and the lead guitar looks like Andy Warhol (and he makes silly faces when the lead singer does something weird), there are two other people two, but they didn't do anything crazy that merits mentioning. They're a little indie rock band straight out of Chicago and the album has a cool cover too.  So you should get it, so that they can pay their rent and make more music for you to listen to, since I'm obviously not helping any.  Although I did tell them to "go on with their bad selves" and I do beleive they took it to heart, and will remember that moment when they think they just can't go on any more.  And remembering that will cause them to continue.    urlLink    Really bad phone camera photo of The Ponys at Spaceland.&nbsp; urlLink

       JUMP!   He's no  urlLink Nikki Sixx , but David Lee Roth may be Kick Startin' Hearts around NYC pretty soon.   urlLink Diamond Dave has relocated to New York and has been taking EMT classes  (check out the medical joke he busts out.  You can't miss it as he says that it's a medical joke after he tells it).  So after a hard night of partying, don't be surprised if you're awakened to what appears to be the strangest Van Halen music video you've ever seen.  So with Roth out of rock, and VH touring with Haggar, if you want to see a show that will be worth your while check out the  urlLink Atomic Punks .   urlLink    Ready for some mouth to mouth?&nbsp; urlLink

       Celebrities Finding More Ways to Keep Your Attention    urlLink The A.V. section of The Onion, gives a short list of celebrity blogs.   Not to be mistaken for blogger celebrities (ie, those who are famous because of their blogs).  While most of them I could care less about, Al Roker is just too good to pass up.  In related celebrity craziness, J-Lo one-ups Ben for headlines yet again.  She couldn't stand the fact that Ben got attention for winning the California State  Poker  Championship,  urlLink so she went out and hired a shoe fastener .  That's right in line with giving up the diva image.  Hopefully she only uses a  urlLink bidet , otherwise I can guess what she's going to hire next.

There's not much  urlLink info  out about it yet, but if you know anything about it please let me know.

       Pushing for that 16th Minute   After that 15th minute of fame, some people just can't let go.  Survivor All-Star Jenna Lewis is the latest "celebrity" (I use that term loosely with her), to fall victim to a released sex tape.  However, there is  urlLink speculation  that she's not a victim at all, as some believe that she and her  urlLink new husband  may have "released" it themselves. Now go to the closest water cooler and discuss.

       urlLink MakRi-admi!   Move over curry drenched food, Spider-man is new hot thing in India.  They're redoing the whole thing.  The kids of India will not know Spider-man to be Peter Parker, but Pavitr Prabhakar.  The Green Goblin will become  urlLink Rakshasa , an Indian mythological demon.  That part sounds pretty cool.  He sounds like a real "maadar chode."  It will deal with issues related to their culture.  The question remains though, does Bombay have enough skyscrapers to make it worthwhile?  What's the point of being Spider-man if you don't have anything to swing from?  Honestly, I mean Spidey would pretty much suck if he lived in LA.  There'd be a couple of buildings downtown for him to swing from, but other than that he'd be stuck in traffic like the rest of us smucks.  I'm going to pitch a Spider-man LA (it'll be like the whole CSI thing.  Same show, different city.), where he's always stuck in traffic on the 405 and he never gets there in time to save people and Peter will be a paparazzo for US Weekly.  The Green Goblin's got that little flying thing, so he's obviously going to tear the city apart.  It will show that the only important power in LA is the power to green light a project.  If only Spider sense could predict a blockbuster.  Back to the Indian Spider-man.  I like how they've decided that he should have a loincloth, baggy pants, and curly-toed shoes;however,  why didn't they throw a turban on him?  I hope they make it into a Bollywood film.  How awesome would that be?   urlLink    Nice shoes.&nbsp; urlLink

       Rock n Roll Dancing Shoes   If you've got 'em put them on.  There seems to be some backlash against the  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  boys, so I'm here to suggest a few bands for you if you're looking to put FF by the wayside so that  urlLink Uncle Grambo  and  urlLink Damore  will still think your best.  I understand the willingness to do this, as everyone wants to hang with these two, and rightfully so.  They are to bloggers what  urlLink Llody Dobler is to women . (thanks to  urlLink the blueprint  for the Klosterman ref).  So I present to you different yet similar music:   urlLink Pink Grease  (the site's color scheme says enough.)   urlLink Chikinki  (I suggest checking out the video for "Like it or Leave it")   urlLink Kings Have Long Arms  (this one is actually techno, but it's fun.  Check it out.  It's free so if you don't like it, no harm done.)   urlLink Pitty Sing  (good stuff from Boston.  In case you're sick of Euro bands.)   urlLink Young Heart Attack  (for those of you who could just go for some straight up rock)  If you don't like these bands, find your own music.   urlLink    Completely unrelated pic of The Gutte, prepared to take your order.&nbsp; urlLink

       Looks Like I'm Not the Only One Putting the "i" in Team.    urlLink This is a wonderfully ridiculous story .  Not because of the cheerleader's mistake, but because of the commotion it caused.  They put the poor girl in detention for 3 days and kicked her off the squad.  Some are even surprised that she hasn't been transferred yet.  I feeling sorry for the spelling bee kids in that town.  They must cane all the losers.  Get over it people.    "Cheerleading commissioner Sandra Dewitt assured Riverside that the actions of their squad member have scarred not only their school but the entire cheerleading profession."    If one vowel can do more damage to your profession than a Playboy spread, just what are you teaching these girls?    The team here at The Swass Report (and by team I mean me), have always put an "i" in team.  So we welcome you, cheerleader, Steve Perry Style (with open arms).  In fact, if you find that your voice is not being heard in this matter, I'm giving you a place to speak your mind here.  Just contact me through comments or email, and you can post all about it on The Swass Report.  I'm dead serious.   urlLink    The official swass report cheerleader.&nbsp; urlLink

       What Ever Happened To? Featuring: Ben Curtis, aka "The Dell Guy"   We all remember the Dell guy.  He went from  urlLink this  to  urlLink this .  Then he basically disappeared.  Until last night.  I was watching  urlLink Scrubs  ( urlLink best ever ) when during a commercial break I was reunited with an old friend.  Turns out the Dell Guy is now the  urlLink GamesnFlix  Guy.  Like most long awaited reunions, it was quite underwhelming.  He lacked the charisma I had grown to love.  Perhaps it was his past weighing heavily upon his shoulders, maybe he was trying to move on and grow as an actor, maybe selling games and movies isn't as exciting as selling computers, or maybe he's off the pot.  I'll never really know.  I do know that he's still running from the five-O.  That's how the commercial started.  I don't really know why, because I didn't pay any attention to the commercial until I realized it was the Dell Guy.  Thinking of him makes me miss the  urlLink Pets.com sock puppet  dog.  Now I'm all nostalgic for commercial characters that aren't even a decade old.   urlLink    Back on the tube, asking you to spend your money.  Just like the old days.&nbsp; urlLink

Which I found to be as solid as today's Marmaduke, and decided to pass them along to you.  I suggest  urlLink this  too, which also comes from Mr. Pants.  You should still go to his site, because I recommend it.  There are other reasons, but go with that one.

       Who's that on the Short Yellow Bus?   Not Method Man or Redman.  And anyone that saw the premiere of  urlLink Method and Red  last night knows why.  This show is all about learning.  It's like the new Sesame Street, but with weed and hoochies and flatscreen tvs everywhere.  If you missed the show, let me recap the valuable lessons I learned.  1.  Don't feed Goldfish Alka Seltzer. (even if they look sick, because it will make them explode.)  2.  Respect your Momma.  (even if she's an uptight white momma, because don't no one look out for you like your moms.)  3.  If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.  (and if you don't you're a quitter, and deserve a good smack upside the head from your momma.)    4.  White People Love Fruit Cake.  (It's their snack of choice.)  5.  Don't Sleep with White Chicks.  (they didn't explain why, but I'm not gonna question Meth's momma.  Maybe all that fruitcake makes them gassy.)  6.  Be Good to your Neighbors.  (especially if you just threw a huge party, and are trying not to get evicted from the neighborhood.)  7.  Duracell Batteries are the Only Batteries Bon Jovi uses in His Microphone When He Goes on Tour.  (and subsequently the only ones you should use too.  Okay, I learned this during a commercial, but still it was a lesson learned so I'm passing it along.)  8.  Once you Start Talking, No One Can Decide Anything Until You Stop.  It's a Filibuster.  (you can invoke the right of a filibuster no matter where you are.  Just go Mr. Smith on 'em all.)  9.  You Got to Stick up for Yourself.  (if someone gets in your face, don't step down.  Raise that pimp hand.)  10.  Redman loves Fried Meatloaf.  (so if your inviting people over to have fried meatloaf, make sure Redman didn't eat it first.  Chances are he probably did.)  That's a lesson every 3 minutes.  You could learn a lot from these guys.  I did.     urlLink    That expression can only mean one thing:  Offscreen Hoochies.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink This can only hurt Kobe's testimony .   Most of the time I'm all for athletes talking all they want.  You're sure to get some real gems.  But if you're in Kobe's situation, just keep your mouth shut.  Don't you know the Miranda Rights?  Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.  This is pretty much how I see things going now...  Eagle County, CO Courtroom Kobe is on the Stand, being cross-examined by the Prosecuting Attorney.   Attorney:   Mister Bryant, did you or...  Kobe:   I only want to be Kobe. (winks and smiles)  Attorney:   Okay... Kobe, did you or did you not guarantee that the Lakers would win game 5?  Kobe:   I promised?  Attorney:   I quote from your press interview 'we'll win Tuesday.'  Kobe:   I'll go with that. It's fine with me. We don't have a choice. We've got to win.  Attorney:   Well, you lost.  Making you a lair.  And now you expect us to believe you, when you tell us you're innocent?  Kobe:   I'm innocent, you know. I didn't force her to do anything against her will. I'm innocent.  Attorney:   Is that a guarantee?  Kobe:   I'll go with that. It's fine with me. We don't have a choice. We've got to win.  Attorney:   Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, Kobe made a promise to you people that he would win game 5.  What did he do?  He lied.  And now he sits here, making another guarantee to you.  History has shown that he cannot be trusted.  The court has proven to you, that he is a liar.  Now I ask of you; are you going to let him get away with it again?  What do you have to say for yourself Kobe?   urlLink Kobe :   I just have so much energy. It was either go home or be the goalkeeper.     The courtroom explodes with shocked reactions. The Judge pounds his gavel, trying desperately to restore order.  Court Recesses.  The Press interviews a couple of Kobe's teammates.   Press:  Given his history as a liar, do you think Kobe is guilty?  Karl Malone:  History wasn't one of the subjects in college I liked. I'm not a big history buff.   Press:   Did Kobe do it?  Shaq:  That's sort of a trick question and I don't have a trick answer.   Press:   It's a simple question Shaq, yes or no?  Shaq:  It is simple. And if you don't stick to simplicity, you'll die a horrible death.    Press:   Do you think Kobe will be found guilty?  Shaq:   That question is a lot like my game.  Which is like the Pythagorean Theorem.  Nobody knows the answer.  Man, I can't wait for this trail to start.   urlLink    Kobe:  How 'bout I buy you all rings, and we make this all go away?  La:  You could have just won us rings instead.&nbsp; urlLink

       Hey Lakers, Let the Indonesian Kids Think You Won.    urlLink Robert Navarre of the Pistons' merchandising department on the Championship clothing:  "We'd have had to destroy 'em if they'd lost Games 5, 6 and 7," Navarre said. "We don't give them to the children in Indonesia."    Why not give those kids the clothes?  The Pistons spanked the Lakers, so that's not something they have to worry about.  But if the Lakers merchandise hasn't been destroyed yet, I say give it to the Indonesian children.  You can still be their champs.  You can even fly down there and parade around like you won.  Karl, you can wave a paper mache trophy over your head as the kids beg you for food.  Shaq, you could give Gary a piggy-back ride, so he doesn't get lost in the sea of children.  Kobe, you can borrow the ring you just gave your wife, and pass it off to all the kids as the real deal.  You also might think about staying down there, Kobe.  There you could be king, instead of incarcerated.   urlLink    That one kid will still be rooting for Batman, but the rest will love the Lakers.&nbsp; urlLink

       Skool's in Session   Last night I headed to  urlLink the Roxy  to check out  urlLink Metal Skool .  Walking into the club was like traveling back to the time of Aquanet and Spandex.  Not only was the band decked out this way, so was more than half the crowd.  It was perhaps the raddest thing I've seen, since the old lady in Vegas that didn't quite make it to the vomitorium.  Metal Skool plays songs ranging from Bon Jovi to Guns n Roses.  They started the set with a rollicking cover of "Rock You Like a Hurricane."  Right there I knew the night would break the needle on the Awesometer.  The show is half rock and half comedy, as they talk inbetween songs for quite some time.  The  urlLink Hoobastank  lead singer was there, and they made fun of him because his band sucks.  But the dude was cool, and got up there with them and rocked some old school Van Halen.  Just as I was thinking the night was over, and it was cool although I was wishing someone cooler than the Hoobastank guy would have shown up, the Skoolers went straight from "Sweet Child of Mine" into "Night Train".  This was bizarre.  They kept a pretty good mix until then, hopping from band to band.  Then who other than Axel effing Rose comes out on stage with them!  Who needs Velvet Revolver when you've got Axel playing with a cover band?  Let me tell you though, Axel needs to lay off the Cheetos.  They played "Paradise City" next, and the Metal Skool lead singer pulled up about twenty girls to dance on stage with them.  This was pretty amazing, but the best part was that none of the girls went for Axel.  They all wanted the cover band guys.  That alone should have Axel on the treadmill this morning.  These dudes are singing your song, with you, but they're getting all the action.  What happened Axel?  It's not a dig against Axel (the man can still rock); it's a testament to how effin' hard the Metal Skool guys rock. They play every Monday and I suggest you check them out if you live in LA.   urlLink    The closest thing to time travel I've seen yet.  Who needs science when you've got Metal?&nbsp; urlLink

       Viva Las Vegas!   Due to stringent "Stays in Vegas" laws.  I am not allowed to speak about most of this past weekend.  Even if I wanted to I couldn't.  As you leave the town, they erase your memory.  Why else do you think people go back after losing exorbanant amounts of money?  What I can tell you is that The Munsters are my new best friends.  You just can't lose on their nickel slot game.  That is the only memory they let me keep.  That and the cold, unwavering stare of Captain Picard.  Wait, I remember one more thing.  It's good to be the King, or at least act like him.  When I was in the lobby at the MGM Grand one fine evening/morning?, I saw three Elvis impersonaters surrounded by a herd of girls.  So apparently all you have to do to meet girls is go to Vegas in your best Elvis costume and hang out in hotel lobbies.  I suggest you try this technique at least once in your life.   urlLink    These guys are money, baby.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink Yoo-hoo  is the new  urlLink PBR    By that I mean that it's the new drink that everybody will drink because nobody drinks it, so they want to drink it to be  urlLink different and cool , but really just end up drinking something they don't really like with everyone else.  Now this sucks for those of us that have always preferred a Yoo-hoo over other beverages, because it raises the prices.  Everyone that drank PBR before the  urlLink hipsters  found it, drank it because it cost 50 cents for a can.  Now you're paying the price of a Guinness for one, and they're not even giving it to you in a can, so no one even knows that you're being cool.  Although you will look cool if you order it from the bartender by saying,"PBR me ASAP!"  Anyway, if you want to look cool start ordering Yoo-hoos.  (They're already on the menu at  urlLink Doughboys .)  If you already drink Yoo-hoo, prepare to gain newfound respect from cool people and for price hikes.  Viva la Yoo-hoo revolution!

I can't vouch for the actual film, since I've only seen  urlLink the trailer and some pictures .  I can conclude from the pictures that the filmmakers where astute enough to figure out that the Nazis had ninjas.  This is important for two reasons.  First, it allows the film to use two of the most dangerous villians around.  Nazis and Ninjas are both enemies most people never wish to tango with in their lifetimes.  But a Nazi Ninja, look out!  Even the great Indiana Jones never had to deal with those.  The second reason it is important is because it brings to light the fact that this was a real possiblity.  The Nazis had Japan on there side, so of course they had ninjas.  Why didn't anyone come up with this earlier.  Perhaps it was to protect the public.  Panic would have definitely hit the streets had this possibility been announced during the war.  Now that it's out there, and it's believable, more  movies  can include these deadly assasins, thereby making movies on a whole 12.3% more exciting.   urlLink    A revolutionary film, sure to change the course of filmmaking as we know it!&nbsp; urlLink

       Nice Choice of Words.   " urlLink Rumsfeld may widen abuse probe "  This is the headline for a link on MSN.  Now do you see why I love that page?  It sounds like Good Ole Rumsy is taking matters into his own hands, and the probes everyone else were using just didn't have enough girth.  The actual headline on the MSNBC page isn't much better at "Rumsfeld may expand prison abuse probe".  Go ahead Rumsy, expand it till your smiling, just don't pop the thing.   urlLink    How much wider?&nbsp; urlLink

       Do as I Say.  C'mon, Do it!   I love the MSN homepage.  They always have such insightful articles.  Today's gem is entitled  urlLink "Ten Surefire Ways to Tick Off Your Co-Workers".   I really wish I was working, so I could use this to it's fullest.  I went to the site, though and found that they want you to avoid these things.  Apparently, they don't find ticking people off to be much fun.  I ;however, do.  I hope that punctuation ticked you off!  Jerks.  Anyway, since I am currently "freelancing", just a fancy word for unemployed, I have no co-workers to tick off.  So I'm asking you, my trust-worthy readers, to do it for me.  Then I want you to tell me how it went.  So here's the short version of the list. (to really get into it, I suggest checking it out on MSN.)   "Ten Surefire Ways to Tick Off Your Co-Workers"   1. Is it all about you?   (apparently co-workers will get ticked off if you make them look bad, to make yourself look good.)  2.  Answering Cell Phone Calls during Meetings.    ( if it's an urgent call, alert those present :  By yelling,"this call is more important than you losers.)  3.  Sending Voicemails that go on and on and on.     (or maybe a blog entry?)  4.  Acting like a Bureaucrat.     (if you don't know what that is, just act like a pirate.)  5.  Reading the newspaper or hammer on your laptop during training sessions or meetings.      (if reading the paper, be sure to let everyone know how good the Marmaduke comic is.  But don't let them see it.)  6.   "I'm like, ya know . . ."       (they want you to speak like a professional.  How about a professional wrestler?)  7.  Doing your bills at the office.     (I've done this.  It didn't tick off anyone.  It may have peeved a few people, though.)  8.  Skirting around the dress code.     (but I work better when I'm unrestricted.)  9.  Taking it too easy on telecommute days.     (I don't even know what a telecommute day is.  But if you do, please do this and tell me if you tick off anyone.)  10.  Acting unethically.      (that's a bit broad MSN, c'mon!  End your list with some strength.  Now they've ticked me off.)  I'm adding my own...  11.  Drink Yoo-hoo everyday and make it known that you love Yoo-hoo so much that you're never without one.  Then when you don't have a Yoo-hoo and someone asks you where your Yoo-hoo is, accuse them of stealing it and rubbing it in your face.  Make a scene for as long, and as loudly as possible.  (this is sure to tick off at least one co-worker)

       Smarter than Your Average Physicist   Apparently Stew forgot to pass on my findings concerning anti-hydrogen from about six months ago to the rest of the physics community.  I won't get into it here, but I basically disproved all of physics as we know it, by asking him to send me a jar of hydrogen.  Now physicists are still working on the old model here, but they are on the search for the  urlLink Higgs Boson .  The Higgs Boson is coined, "the Holy Grail of Physics".  So lets pretend that physics as they know it is still relevant.   According to the Higgs theory, nothing in the Universe would have any mass without the Higgs particle.  Nice theory Higgs.  Because everything obviously does have mass, you've set yourself up to look right very nicely.  Well, here's the Johnny No Thumbs Theory: "Higgs watches too much Sci-Fi channel, and needs to get off his mass."  According to Higgs, the particle is associated with an energy field that permeates the entire universe.  Sounds a lot like "the force" to me.  I don't care that Higgs had this theory in 1960, Lucas had been working on this  Star Wars  thing since well before that.  You'll just have to trust me on this one.  So stop looking for the Higgs Boson.  It doesn't exist.  Stop putting money into this research, and start giving me money to build a new physics, as I've debunked the old one earlier this year.  Stew, back me up on this.  Prepare to join the Neutron Train kids, New Physics is coming to town.

       Because Zombie Nixon Was Just Too Creepy   I know the last few days have been hard on America.  But that's why I bring you this encouraging news.  I think  urlLink this  will finally get America off their asses and into the voting booths.  I'm actually voting for Bush now.  I have to give Kerry credit for this as I stole it off  urlLink her site , but I needed to spread the good word to the American public (and by the American public I mean the 5 people that visit this site).  So go to her site if you don't already (especially if you live in LA).  She tells you about good music, movies, and zombies.

        urlLink My Governor  Can Beat Up Your Governor   And after he does, he's going to take your State's money to pay off our debt, and take all the women and tell them to  urlLink join Arnold  (turns out it's not just a campaign slogan).  Minnesota maybe the only state that could be safe.  I'm not sure if  urlLink "The Body"  is still your Governor.  For those of you who were not lucky enough to witness the gubernatorial race for California this year, opponents to Mr. S made sure we heard from every woman Arnold had harassed and groped throughout his illustrious career  (which was apparently a lot).  I don't know how much of this you other States heard.  I live in my little bubble of sunshine here, where other States don't matter, except maybe New York but we really only care about the City.  Anyway, I was talking about Arnold and his roaming hands.  What I'm getting around to is that in his cameo for   urlLink Around the World in 80 Days  , he plays some sort of playboy prince, and people may get their undies in a bunch over it.  So if you see anyone with bunched undies in the next couple weeks, that's probably why.  Here's my favorite quote with an elliptical which I will post somewhat out of context:   urlLink "Although he's a philanderer in the movie ..."   It just finishes itself, doesn't it. Unfortunately for any ladies that recently claimed harassment against Arnold, he will be considered innocent as he was preparing for the role.  (This entry was really just an excuse to use the word gubernatorial.)    urlLink    Our Governor picks on fat kids.&nbsp; urlLink

       With Bands Like These, Who Needs Dance, Dance, Revolution?    urlLink Last night  I went to Spaceland to see  urlLink Scissor Sisters .  Being the second band of a free show, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But these guys turned a jaded LA show into a dance club for at least an hour.  Also the first time I've seen a band that was not the headliner, come back out for a well deserved encore.  Great show, if you missed them, they'll be coming back for a West Coast tour in July and a national one in September.  That's not all though.  On Sunday I saw  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  at the Wiltern.  These boys are a little more rock and roll, but you can still dance your ass off to them.  Which, for LA, a decent amount of folks did.  The rest just bobbed their heads and probably went to their chiropractors in the morning complaining of a sore neck, after picking up an herbal tea with a splash of soy milk, but before heading off to yoga.  If you have the opportunity to catch either of these bands live, do it.  Seriously though, I've got to see more  urlLink awesome  bands like these since I've just dropped my gym membership.  It's only been two shows, but the ladies have already been asking if I've been working out.  To which I reply, "Have you seen today's  urlLink Marmaduke ?"   urlLink Ladies  love Marmaduke.  Trust me on this one.   urlLink    They're like a party in your pants, but without any awkward humiliation.&nbsp; urlLink

       Cops Hate Rappers  Shortly after the announcement of his foray into rap music, David Hasselhoff (aka Hassle the Hoff) is being harassed by the fuzz.   urlLink The Hoff  was slapped with suspicion of DUI.  Apparently the five-o are taking his rap name a bit too seriously.  Come on officers, it's a play on words!  Don't you remember what Ice-T said about his humor?  This seems to be another case of the police hating someone just because he raps.  They didn't even get him on a DUI, just suspicion.  Sounds like a conspiracy to me.  Right up there with the Biggie/Tupac murders.   urlLink    Sorry Dave, but KIT should not be danced upon.&nbsp; urlLink

       Johnny No Thumbs is A man of his word.   Hoj was the winner of yesterday's contest.  Easy question? Yes.  A classic one nonetheless. So here's Johnny!!....wait, I mean the Hoj...   Sup Senor No Thumbs   "So I just ordered two books on Amazon.com about voice-overs and the potential for a career doing it.  I had a $25  gift  certificate and couldn't think of anything else better to blow it on so I'm feeding my longstanding pipe dream.  I'll hit you all with the  urlLink review (s) if the books aren't too lame and who knows...maybe you'll hear the tall Jewish wonder doing the voice-over for a Tide or Ford commercial some day.  Maybe my advertising industry brother or my Hollywood loving brotha Rando could get me an in.  What do you say Rando?  Maybe I'll introduce you to Guttenberg in exchange for your help with a voice-over gig.  Lets not forget the standings when it comes to random encounters with the Stevemeister (as his friends call him).  Hoju 1, Johnny No Thumbs 0."

       An Epic Battle!  Who will Prevail?   I don't often get into politics on this site, and I'm not really going to now.  However, if you wish to see President Bush's recent enemy check  urlLink this  out.  The good news is that this comes from a site in China.  Wait, that's bad news.  Apparently everyone is making fun of us.  Well, after Bush bombs the crap out of that Umbrella, we can guess who's next.

       Me and T are here to Help.   With the new movie  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow   (stellar review about halfway done the page)out in theaters, environmental advocacy groups are trying to scare us by saying that this could really happen.  Now I'm no weather genius so I don't know what to tell you, but  urlLink Mr. T   urlLink apparently is .  So listen to him kids.  Especially if you live in LA, because that's where the tornadoes will hit.  Or if you live in the Midwest and already experience tornadoes without the whole end of the world scenario, then you should listen to him too.

       The Gutte Deserves Better than That.   It has come to my attention that the people over at steveguttenberg.net do not wish to spread the love.  So I will be replacing The Gutte link.  Until I find a suitable replacement, the link shall take you to his IMDB page.  I am saddened to know that such callous-hearted Guttenberg fans exist.  And to them I say in the immortal words of  urlLink Eddie Simmons ,"You...You...You make me sick. You've just gone down two steps in my...my book!"   But we must soldier on. For a few bad apples will not stop my mission.     urlLink    Let's keep that smile on his face folks.&nbsp; urlLink

Apparently he has an album titled Swass.  But if there was a list of 2,000 rappers I'd like to be associated with, I'm sure Sir Mix would be one of them.   urlLink    This clown gives me two thumbs up.  Does he mean it?

       I'm Better than You.   Normally I wouldn't be so brazen, but last night my roommate and I single-handedly made a band play an encore, which was then dedicated to us.  So unless you've ever had an encore you created (without the help of a stadium of people) dedicated to you, I am indeed better than you.  It was right up there with the time Stipe pointed back at CJ and me.    So the band was  urlLink Kennedy .  A local favorite of mine that I've been tauting for some time now.  The venue was  urlLink Fais do do  for the  urlLink little radio  show.  They have one every Wednesday night, and the covers only $6.  They've been putting together some sweet ass shows, but the crowds aren't there yet.  Go support  urlLink pirate  radio!  You like  urlLink pirates  don't cha?  If you don't, I don't like you.  Anyway, go to their site, sign up for the mailing list and they'll tell you who's playing each week.  When I go again, I don't want to see a bunch of lame-os too concerned with losing their seats to get up and rock.  Because minus a few, that's basically who showed up.  On a final note, Kennedy rocks, GO SEE THEM!   urlLink    He's so rockstar, he doesn't care if gas is expensive.  He's still gonna waste it.&nbsp; urlLink

If you like the Replacements, you'll like these blokes.  And lastly is  urlLink Athlete .  This album is as solid as today's  urlLink Marmaduke  (which you should also check out.  Especially if you can't afford to buy albums).   urlLink  urlLink    check this out.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    ...and this...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    ...and this.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink I Found My Summer Job   It's time to dust off the ole butterfly net, and empty one of grandma's pickle jars.  Scientists are offering $10 dollars an ounce for lightning bugs.  Now the thing I need to know is whether lightning bugs and fireflies are the same thing.  I haven't figured that one out in my research yet.  What I did figure out though, is that if Japanese Animation is correct, that place is a gold mine.  Almost every other picture I came across was some anime with lightning bugs overrunning the place.  A ticket to Japan, may pay for itself and then some if these trends continue.    urlLink    These guys should get a net and a jar.&nbsp; urlLink

       Somebody's Listening to Me  I spent yesterday recovering from the aforementioned sunburn, sitting on the couch.  I turned on the tv and there's a close-up of the Gutte!  He's saying, "This will be my comeback."  Apparently someone at ABC is on the right track to bring up ratings.  They also chose a movie where his character is named Buzzy.  Coincidence?  I think not.  The Gutte is the effing buzz, and people are finally taking note.  Hopefully he can find some time away from his duties as the honorary mayor of the Pacific Palisades, to start acting in some new movies.  Pretty soon that live action Marmaduke will be on the slate.   urlLink    notice who's billed first!&nbsp; urlLink

       Swass Fact #2  A coating of sand does not work as sunblock.  I learned this lesson first hand this weekend playing beach volleyball down in San Diego.  After making digs that rival Sinjin Smith and Karch Kiraly, I found myself covered in a layer of sand so thick I considered myself safe from those nasty UV rays.  Not the case.  On the upside, I did discover that I'm an awesome beach volleyball player.  My serve not only caused opposing teams to request that I take it easy on them, but also convinced them that I'm probably the bastard child of Randy Stoklos.

       Your newest local Kabbalah Centers:  Target(expensive and questionable) and The Swass Report (cheap and knows real Jewish people and can prove it).   That's right my friends, the hip answer to Wal-mart is know selling packages of "special" red string for you to make your  urlLink Kabbalah bracelets  to ward off the evil eye.  This "special" string has been to Israel and taken to a "special" tomb, and then Target lets you buy it for $26.  That's way cheaper than a plane ticket to Israel.  However, if you don't have $26 for some red thread, I'm offering my services.  For just $7, I'll will have the Hoj cut a piece of red thread and tie it for you.  He's the most Jewish person I know, and the law of transient properties tells me that if he's Jewish, he must know someone that's been to this tomb in Israel, therefore the Hoj has been to this tomb as well, and henceforth so has your string.  It holds up in my book, which is not the torah by and by (which is really more of a scroll than book anyway).  With your new Kaballah string you will also receive a certificate of Jewthenticity, signed by the Hoj himself and stamped as Jewthentic by yours truly.  Target won't offer you this service.  You just have to take their word for it, and chances are in was made in a sweatshop in Mexico City.  Is that a risk your willing to chance $26 bucks on?  I don't think so.  You'll be getting the evil eye all over the place, and you'll be out $26.  At least if any evil eyes get through with our string on, you can just whip out the certificate of Jewthenticity to prove to them that it is indeed real, and that they should retract the evil glare they previously gave you.

       Science vs. Street Smarts   Today's lesson: Opening a soda can so that it does not explode on you.   urlLink Here's science's method :  Tap the top of the can, or let it sit.   And here's Johnny No Thumbs patented street smarts method:   Grab two sodas.  One for you, one for a friend.  Let the friend open his first.  Then shake yours up, and aim it at your friend when you open it.  Since it may explode anyways, you might as well make the most of it.  Now when your friend goes to clean himself off, give him some paper towels and offer to hold his drink while he mops himself off.  Then drink your friend's soda.  Not only does this insure that you don't have a soda explode on you, but it's pretty dang funny too.  If a third friend is around, he should give the victim a hotfoot, just to up the ante (and by ante I mean hilarity).

       What's Marmaduke Been Up to This Week?     &nbsp;  Here's a recap of Marmaduke's week so far:     urlLink Monday:&nbsp;   He tries to help do the dishes, but Dottie yells at him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;(some say Dottie's "sweet-natured" but I say she's got her own section in the jerkstore.)     urlLink Tuesday: &nbsp;  His date from last night is yelling on the phone because he didn't show up.  (The Duke just sits there, all non-chalant-like.&nbsp; You know he's got ladies lined up around the block.)     urlLink Wednesday: &nbsp;  Takes George's garage door opener for his new pimped-out doghouse door.  (This dog is a genius.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Comic gold)     urlLink Thrusday:  &nbsp; He becomes a cab driver.&nbsp; George asks,"where's the cab driver?"&nbsp;  (Who cares George!&nbsp; Not only can your dog figure out how to install a garage door opener, he can drive a car too.&nbsp; At that point, Marmaduke could have eaten the cabbie and I wouldn't care.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this comic was in the dictionary it would have had&nbsp;an "also see: Hilarious" after it.)     urlLink Friday:  &nbsp; Marmaduke becomes retarded.&nbsp; Seriously.  ( What happened, Marm?&nbsp; Just yesterday you where driving a car around.&nbsp; My best guess is that Dottie socked him in the head with a sock full of oranges while he was sleeping.)   Luckily for you if you missed any of these gems, I've linked them all.  Why?&nbsp; Because I'm a giver.   If you're unfamiliar with the Marmaduke comic strip,  urlLink I suggest checking out this cast list .  It's a good start on your way to appreciating this spendorrific comic.

       A public apology   I apologize for my lack of recent posts.  I have been working on an exciting new business venture that is going to sweep America.  I can't give you any details until the product is complete, but I can promise that it will be very hyped upon release, and you my readers will be the first to know.  Hopefully it will be out by next Monday!  Stay tuned.

       Thursday, Thursday, Thursday!!!   Come to the Swass Report and see  urlLink Robosaurus !  He is appearing in support of Manute's recovery.  Roger McDowell wants to buy one, so he can give Darryl Strawberry the ultimate hotfoot.  I once saw a truck that transformed into a car eating, fire breathing dinosaur but I couldn't find a picture of that one.  It was one of the coolest things I've ever witnessed.  I think it was called Truckasaurus.  How rad would it be if Truckasaurus and Robosaurus battled to the death?  It would rival Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla in awesomeness.  If you're not familiar with G vs. SG, I'll make my next post about why it's the best.  Until then, enjoy the destructive mayhem of Robosaurus!   urlLink    Why didn't we unleash a couple of these in Iraq?&nbsp; urlLink

       Swass Fact #4   Minute Bol is the best skee-ball player I've ever seen.   He just kept hitting the 100 point ring, one after another.  He had easily over 100 tickets with just one token.  That's what the picture's of.  He was so excited because he was going to use his winnings to help his ailing tribesman, Manute.  However, right after this picture was snapped by yours truely, Roger McDowell snuck up behind him and gave him a hotfoot.  It was hilarious.  Minute's tickets went up in flames, as did his foot.  He was hopping around trying to stomp it out.  It was amazing how much he looked like the kids playing Dance, Dance, Revolution.  I laughed so hard I cried.  If I wasn't laughing so hard I would have thought to take pictures of it.  Roger taught me a valuable lesson that day.  He called it Roger Rule #1 :  At no time, in no situation, on no person is a hotfoot ever off limits.  Words I will forever live by.    urlLink    That's over 100 tickets, just from one token.&nbsp; urlLink

       An Answer to an Age Old Problem?   When riding around with a group of friends, the passenger or "shotgun" seat is coveted by everyone.  This is why the shotgun game was invented.  To prevent fights over this precious seat.  However, it seems that everyone has different rules to this game.  Now this causes fights, which the game was originally supposed to prevent.  It's a big catch 22.  This may be the solution.   urlLink A universal shotgun rule book .  This should be spread throughout all of the land, and will overrule the old rule of the driver uses his rules.  I'm torn however, as I enjoy the bickering and fighting over the seat and rules, more than actually having the seat (unless it's a long ride, then I'll do whatever it takes to win).   urlLink    Not only did this old woman score the shotgun seat, she's rubbing it in with a little showboating.  A bet her friends hope her visor flies off before they make it to the bingo hall.&nbsp; urlLink

       Truancy from Skool will not be Accepted   I went to  urlLink Metal Skool  again last night.  I'll give you a review of last night's show.  But this is the last time. After this, if you miss the show you can't live vicariously through me.  It just doesn't do the band justice, and I'd be wasting my time on you shut-ins.  Stay on the couch..see if I care.  I'm going to rock.    I didn't get there in time for the opening bands, so find someone else to fill you in on those.  Metal Skool kicked it off last night with Motley Crue's  Talk Dirty to Me .  From that moment on, anyone in the audience that hadn't seen them before was hooked.  The lead guitarist took some time to show the audience his Stars and Stripes spandex pants.  While it was related to the 4th of July, it seemed to be more of an excuse to show his ass to the ladies.  Which is another thing about a Metal Skool show, if you come with your girlfriend, expect to go home alone as she'll end up with the band.  This is a fact which should not surprise you when you're at the show as they flat out tell you, a lot.  In fact, they pretty much rub it in your face.  They can be arrogant though, because they're right.  So don't say I didn't warn you.  About halfway into the show they brought some schmoe up on stage to sing Bon Jovi's  Shot through the Heart .  He wasn't good.  No one came to see some middle management ex-frat boy get up on stage.  They came to see long hair, spandex catsuits, and a singer that can do a jumping splits.  Luckily the singer kicked that dude off stage.  Then he brought up Hal Sparks.  Now  urlLink Hal Sparks  is hilarious, but can he rock?  Yes, Hal Sparks can rock.  He belted out some Skid Row and left me thinking there's nothing he can't do.  I see Hal has a band.  I haven't heard them, but after seeing him perform last night I'm definitely going to check it out.  Then Metal Skool took it to a whole new level for me, and played Whitesnake's  Here I Go Again .  I love that effin' song.  Half way through though they starting playing it in different genres of music.  This convinced me that  Here I Go Again  could not only be an awesome rock song, but the best country, reggae, and Aggro song ever.  If they were to record this cover in each way and release it to every radio station, they could hit number one on all of them.  They also convinced a bunch of girls to dance on a stripper pole for an original song about strippers, and finished off the night with the crowd singing and headbanging along to  Were Not Gonna Take It .  They played more songs than I mention here, so you'll have to go next time to get the full effect.  They also played a lot of different songs each time I go.  I can't wait for the day I see them play Motley Crue's Kick Start My Heart .  If you know them, tell them to play it.    I can't see how anyone wouldn't think this is awesome.  So throw your backpack on, get on the bus, and get your ass to Skool.   urlLink    Hal knows how to bring the Metal Yell.&nbsp; urlLink

       I never thought a dentistry site could be so cool.   But seriously  urlLink floss.com  is awesome.  Besides giving you crucial information about  urlLink toothbrush purchases , you can send  urlLink bad breath notices .   I suggest sending a bunch of those to Sir Chugs-a-lot, as his breath reeks.  It's like he ate a dead skunk and washed it down with rancid milk mixed with Tang.

Put up Metal Skool review for last night's show. 4.  Inform at least one stranger about the magic that is  urlLink the Gutte . 5.  See  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 . 6.   urlLink floss . 7.  Think of a new contest.

        urlLink We Have a Flag!    Thanks goes out to Paul over at  urlLink Daily Ramblings  for inventing the official  urlLink Swass Report Flag .  Now I can properly pay my respects to Manute by flying it at 3/4 mast.  I suggest you all print it out and make a mast out of a straw and fly the flag at 3/4 mast on your desk until Manute recovers.  I can also use it when conquering land.  Once I place my flag on the boulder in the park by my house everyone will see that it belongs to me, and me only.  This is awesome.

       Who's Bringing Back the Hot Foot?   Me.  That's who.  What's a hot foot you ask?  Remember watching those old sports bloopers as a kid?  The ones that came on right after the Saturday morning cartoons.  Well, remember when a baseball player would be sleeping and his teammates would light his shoe on fire, and the guy would dance all crazy-like trying to extinguish the flames?  That, my friends, is a hot foot.  It ranks right up there with Steve Guttenberg and Marmaduke in hilarity.  And the best part is that it's cheap and easy to do.  All you need is a book of matches and a friend that is unaware of your presence.  Then you just stick some matches on his or her shoe, ignite them, and watch as your friend flails around trying to put the fire out.  This will give you a good laugh, all for under a dollar.

       The Swass Report Needs its own Flag.   That way I could fly it at 3/4 mast until  urlLink Manute Bol recovers from a horrific car accident .  Now why do I care so much about a basketball player that only averaged 2.6 points a game (besides the fact that he blocked more shots per minute than anyone in league history)?  Because he is a fellow  urlLink Dinka  tribesman of my good friend Randy, or Minute Bol as he was known back in Sudan.  Randy is simply the American name given to him after his exile from the  urlLink Dinka  tribe.  You see, Randy turned out to be too short and too white for the rest of the tribe's liking.  Hence the name Minute.  He was also known as "The Little Ritz" by schoolmates, which in Dinka means "Tiny Cracker".  The tribe elders voted him out when he was but five years old, and put him in a rickety wooden raft which found it's way to the shores of the USA.  While the Dinkas were rough on the outcast runt of the tribe,  urlLink Manute  was always good to him.  And therefore, I will be good to  urlLink Manute  and wish him a speedy recovery.  As for the rest of the Dinkas, if they say anything bad about my reject friend, I will headbutt them in the kneecap.   urlLink    Manute let Minute play ball with him at the first ever distant relative all-star game.&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink You May Fly Your Swass Report Flags back at Full Mast .   It appears that Manute Bol is doing better.  After a terrible accident in which the cab he was riding in flipped over,  urlLink the Dinka tribesman is feeling well enough to sue the pants off the cab company responsible.   I really hope that his lawyers suggest suing for their pants, because I want to see Manute wear them as shorts.  I believe that it would make me laugh.  And with all the zombies and injured heros in the world today, I could use a good Manute gag.  The man has incredible comic timing.  He should have starred in  urlLink My Giant .  Of course if I was casting it, the Gutte would have replaced Billy Crystal.  Manute and the Gutte, that has blockbuster written all over it!  It just rolls off the tongue.  They could have been the next Martin and Lewis.  Plus all of the advertising could mention that the movie is a blockbuster, and there would be a cardboard life-size cut-out of Manute blocking something and the Gutte standing next to him being his usual awesome self.  I can't wait until they let me run one of these studios.   urlLink    The ad campaigns would look something like this.  Only not done with MS Paint.&nbsp; urlLink     (the recent  urlLink links to myself  are a self-congratulatory act to reward myself for my 100th post.)

       Has  urlLink Zombie Affleck  Spread the Disease?   As I was perusing my favorite websites today, I found this picture of Brittany Murphy over at  urlLink Uncle Grambo's  site.  He says crack whore, I say zombie.  Look at the slack jaw, the zombie posture, and the look of insatiable desire for brains in her clouded zombie eyes.  Zombie Affleck may work slow (like the zombies of yore) but it's spreading.  Unless, and I pray this is what it is, Brittany is simply publicly auditioning for a role in the new zombie movie shooting at Chernobyl that I read about over at  urlLink Kerry's site .  If you where hoping for more information on the Gutte today, it's not going to happen.  I have to keep my eyes on this whole Hollywood Zombie Invasion that's on the verge of spreading rapidly.  Once it's under control, I'll give you the Gutte info you've been craving.   urlLink    On the hunt for brains, too?&nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink Get a Swass Report Coffee Mug !   I designed a swass coffee mug.  It's got a picture of an old dude on it enjoying his coffee, and under the picture it says "Old People Love Coffee."  Old people do love coffee.  You don't have to love coffee to get this mug though.  You could put all sorts of different things in it, like booze. Here's a discussion you'd probably have if you put booze in it.   Some dude:   Hey, sweet mug.  You:   Thanks.  Some dude :  Old people  do  like coffee.  You:   Yeah, Old people like coffee...BUT I LIKE BOOZE! (you chug the entire mug)  Some dude:   You rock at drinking booze like old folks rock at drinking coffee and breaking their hips!  Will you be my friend?  You:   Maybe for five dollars, or more booze.  Some dude:   Rad. (he runs off to get you money or booze.)  I can't promise that this will happen if you buy a mug, but I can promise that it won't happen if you don't. Think about it.

       More Gutte!  (You know you want it.)  I told you that you can't stop him.  I found this swass pic of the Gutte today, and it seemed fitting for reasons that make sense to those of you who know my darkest secrets.  I didn't really read the article I took it from,  urlLink but you can if you feel like it .  I think it has something to do with comparing the Gutte and the Police Academy movies to Judge Reinhold and his cop comedy.  I do know that Judge was up for the role of Mahoney and he didn't get it, so this comparison seems pointless.  The Gutte is obviously the better of the two, because:  1. He got the role.  2. I never heard of Judge's movie before. 3. He's the Gutte. 4. All people remember of Judge's most popular movie are Phoebe Cate's bare breasts and Sean Penn. 5. He's the Gutte.  I mean seriously.  It's like trying to compare Rex Morgan MD with Prince Valiant.  It's time that could be better spend reading today's Marmaduke (which is solid by the way).    urlLink    They couldn't even get a decent picture of Judge.&nbsp; urlLink

       Maybe there isn't a God afterall.   Apparently the radio's finally started to play too much good music, and somebody's trying to do something about it.   urlLink Three of the four former members of Creed have put together a new band, because there's just not enough crap to fill the void created once Creed left apparently.   They are calling themselves Alter Bridge and the first show is in Pontiac Michigan.  Now normally I wouldn't ask anyone to go to this show, but there is a recurring nightmare I've had after hearing of this and I need to make sure it doesn't happen.  You know how in  Spinal Tap   the guitarist leaves the band, but then later is standing backstage wishing he was out there and the lead singer asks him to come out and play and they reunite to play Japan?  Well, in this nightmare, it's the same thing only with Scott Suck (or whatever his name is, you know, Creed's old singer)coming from backstage to reunite with the band, only in the dream they don't get sent off to Japan.  So if anyone can go to this show, make sure Scott Suck doesn't get on that stage.  Take whatever means possible.  And if you have some spare time during the show, try your best to break-up this new act while your at it.  I'll send you a toaster if you can get any of them deported to Japan.  People of Michigan, you are our only hope.

       Relaxing and Rocking on Rooftops.   As Al can attest, I love the combination of rooftops and drinks.  I really don't think there's a better combo around.  So it's a good thing that in LA the rooftops are pretty cool.  This weekend I spent Sunday on top of the Standard Hotel in Downtown at the  urlLink Vice  party.  Thanks to Moss for scoring the tickets.   urlLink The Fever  played a short set.  It rocked and I'm pretty sure they did a GnR cover.  They're playing  urlLink Spaceland  soon.  Go see them.  Another highlight of the day was some Road Rules or Real World guy who's a bartender there now, yelling at Moss and  urlLink Kerry  "No Pictures!" as they tried to sneak a snapshot of him.  Oh yeah, and free Sparks.  That rocked too.   urlLink    The Fever: Rocking  the rooftop Downtown.&nbsp; urlLink
