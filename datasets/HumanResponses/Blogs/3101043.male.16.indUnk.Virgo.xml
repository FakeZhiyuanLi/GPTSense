      Ok folks, Felix Carmichael is finally making his journalistic debut on Alex Mayer's new site, which has been designed to provide reviews on contemporary tunes, flicks and books.  As you can see this is the music section, which I will oversee like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt oversaw his legions of slaves.  There will be times when you and I will celebrate at the magnificence of your favorite artist's newest release, and there will be times when I will defecate upon the reputation of that very same artist.  However I swear to you the reader that I will provide nothing but the most honest criticism.  If the question "Why does this guy think his opinion is better than everyone else's?" ever pops into your head, I will ask you to get the hell off my site and throw your money around in a Best Buy until you are convinced that there is no way you will find quality music without consulting someone else's opinion.  I'm not asking you to do what I say, rather I'm asking you to read about your music and to be informed about it. Get involved!    Felix Carmichael

         Five Iron Frenzy has, after 8 years, 6 full-length albums, one EP, countless 7" vinyls and appearances on various compilations, decided to call it quits.  In their farewell two-disc set, Five Iron combines an all-new full-length album ("The End is Near" - Disc 1) and a complete live recording of their final concert ("The End is Here" - Disc 2).  Having attained a huge cult following among America's youth, I don't think I can fully describe the impact Five Iron has had over the years.  I'll let this review speak for me:   By Aleem Hossain   "It’s impossible to do the album justice in a short review as it is quintessential of everything FIF has stood for. Reese Roper has long-established himself as one of the most creative and idiomatic singers and songwriters in the industry and 'The End...' showcases him at his best. There’s a vitriolic attack on capitalism ("American Kryptonite"); a ruthless onslaught on media spin ("Anchors Away") and savage swipes at the music industry ("So Far, So Bad"). The light-hearted "Wizard Needs Food, Badly" is a track for all those men who just want to play with big boys' toys. The aptly named, "That’s How The Story Ends" serves to bring a sense of closure with references to older songs such as "Where Is Micah?", "The Untimely Death Of Brad" and "These Are Not My Pants," as well as a farewell to favourite characters such as Combat Chuck, Kitty Doggy and the blue comb. "It Was Beautiful" is a sincere song of praise and thanks to God as the band remember the past eight years together. Musically, the band combines elements of rock, punk, ska and metal, whilst "See The Flames Being To Crawl" features the rasta vocal and groove that the band experimented with on 'All The Hype That Money Can Buy.' By far the brightest jewel on the album is the painfully honest closing track "On Distant Shores" which recognises the band’s struggles and seems to encompass everything that FIF writes about. The song borrows its closing lines from, what is undeniably one of FIF’s most powerful songs, "Every New Day". Clearly, a lot of thought and detail has been put into this project as it combines the best musical elements of previous releases with challenging, poignant and, in typical Five Iron style, humorous lyrics.   You could almost buy the record, which comes in a jewel case and cardboard sleeve, for Douglas Ten Napel's [album] artwork alone. Rumours are bound to be rife as Ten Napel's seemingly dead-and-buried Five Iron Bunny Monster nudges its box open [on the final page]. Suggestion, perhaps, that this is not FIF's final chapter, though I prefer to think that this is just an ironic prod at the rumours which seem to have been an inherent part of FIF's career. Only time will tell, I guess, but the band will leave a huge hole in Christian music as a band who continually sounded so fresh and addressed issues that most Christian bands pretend are not there. It is that ability to balance taboo issues, witty cynicism with a sublime sense of humour that have made Five Iron one of the most refreshing, challenging, unique and loved bands for the best part of a decade. I'm sure, even in years to come, their albums will remain as relevant as ever."     Yeah.   Grade: A-

         I'm trying a new format for music reviews, so bear with me...   Summary:  With it's third full-length album, rock outfit Pillar solidifies it's place in the alternative rock genre.  With a more cultivated, refined sound, Pillar's maturity since it's debut album  Above  shows in both the musical and lyrical aspects of their new record.   Pluses:  As previously stated, Pillar brings a much more refined and mature sound to the new album, and the lyrics show growth as well (for example, on "Rewind"). The musical quality is for the most part impressive, and this album can easily be counted as one of the top releases in the alternative genre this year.   Minuses:  A few tracks fall short: "Dirty Little Secret" and "Staring Back" are songs that cause me to usually hit the "skip" button on my CD player. "Underneath It All" and "One Thing" don't stand out as anything special, and the punk rock feel of "Holding On" - while a decent song - seems out of place on the album.   Standout Tracks:  - "Hypnotized," "Bring Me Down," "Let it Out," "Rewind," "Frontline," and "Aftershock."   Grade: B

         Like R&B but sick of the shallow, materialistic lyrics found in most R&B albums? Look no further than Out of Eden.  The veteran R&B female trio delivers yet again with their 5th full-length album, and after a decade in the music business, they've perfected their sound.  Smooth, harmonic vocals blended with heavy beats and catchy rhythms are OOE's trademark, and they offer up a fresh serving with  Love, Peace, and Happiness .  The album opens with the upbeat intro track "Make Way." The rapid-fire vocals accompany a sort of explanation of OOE's mission and overall message.  The next few songs, "Just the Way," and the title track, are positive, lighthearted diddys that pretty much exemplify the tone and message of the album (just take a look at the title).  "Soldiers," the heavy, bass-laden club anthem, is catchy and changes the tone, but the real standout is the next track, "I Know." Leaving the fluff and and happy tone of the beginning tracks, it's written in the form of 2 conversations with inner-city teens - a 14-year old prostitute and a high-school gang member.  First the lyrics go through a series of lines that begin "I wish-," then moving into the chorus, each line beginning with "I know-." A touching and heartfelt plea to today's urban youth, it's one of the best songs on the album.  "It's You" returns to the positive and light tone of the majority of the album, but the next two tracks - "Shoulda' Listened" and "Could've Been Me" - are more serious.  "Shoulda' Listened" details a prodigal-daughter type story with a young woman writing a letter about how she should have listened to the advice of her mother and pastor, but she didn't and not she's in a bad situation.  Hope still prevails in the end, however, as the woman says:    "But I've seen the light somehow / And I vow to listen now But you don't have to tell me twice / I'm gonna listen now."   "Could've Been Me" is a musically rich song, blending heavy beats with acoustic guitar and strings.  OOE gives thanks for their great lives, looking at more unfortunate people and saying "it could've been me," as well as encourageing listeners to remember this fact and lend a hand to those people.  "Drama Free" is a catchy, upbeat track that complains about a gossipy, shallow friend who lives life like it's a daytime drama.  "Secret" tells people of faith to live in such a way that other people will notice something different about them and ask them what their "secret" is.  The album closes on the slower, deeper "Sincerely," with OOE giving a touching, heartfelt thanks to their savior for saving them even though they're unworthy.    Grade=B-

      by David Frum and Richard Perle    How to win the War on Terror       This book's introduction states:   "For us, terrorism remains the great evil of our time, and the war against this evil, our generations' greatest cause.  We do not believe that Americans are fighting this evil to minimize it or manage it.  We believe they are fighting to win - to end this evil before it kills again and on a genocidal scale.  There is no middle way for Americans: it is victory or holocaust.  This book is a manual for victory.   At first, that sounded kind of overly melodramatic to me.  I've since changed my mind.  The authors of this book lay out their recommendations for how America should fight the War on Terror.  They take the reader on a journey through various aspects of the war: from the war at home, and how to improve domestic security - to the war abroad, and detailed analysis of the threats each rogue nation (Iran, Syria, North Korea, etc.) poses to the U.S. and what strategy to use when confronting each nation.  The authors discuss how America has to fight the war of ideas against militant Islamist ideology to kill it at it's roots and prevent it from recruiting more young extremists to it's cause.  To this end, a major suggestion is to shut down Saudi-Arabia-funded Wahhabi Islamic schools around the world (including the U.S.) that preach hate and indoctrinate millions of young schoolchildren worldwide in their extremist brand of Islam.  The book also discusses the institutional problems within our intelligence agencies CIA and FBI, and offers ways to reform these agencies, as well as other sections of the government apparatus, like the Deparment of State and the Department of Defense.  The authors then spell out the realities of who our friends and foes are in the world community.  From France to China to Russia to Pakistan to the UN, Fum and Perle expose each nation's  (or organizations') true record on terrorism and their motives in the War on Terror.  The authors also offer ways in which we can forster better, more honest relationships with these nations - one main and recurring theme being free trade.  In the authors' view, free trade leads to greater economic prosperity for citizens in these nations, which undercuts desperation and poverty that leads to support for radical religious ideologies and makes such people more aware of the benefits that freedom and democracy can offer.  Sort of like a 21st century "Marshall Plan."  The book ends with a philisophical conclusion - that the war on Terror is not only a war of self-defense (which it unquestionably is); it is also a War for Liberty.  The authors argue persuasively that a win for the U.S. in this war will almost invariably help and strengthen the cause of freedom in every non-free nation worldwide.  On the other hand, a defeat in this war will have the opposite effect.  The conclusion addresses the fallacy of the charge made by some (including, notably, Kofi Annan) that the U.S. is "trying to impose democracy by force."  Frum and Perle point out that many countries that have thriving democracies today whose democracy could only have been possible through outside assistance and sometimes military force (re: Germany, Japan, Taiwan).  Finally, it states that while America's record in protecting the freedom of smaller nations against their more powerful, non-democratic neighbors has been far from perfect, it still remains a record to be proud of.  America, it concludes, in it's best moments, is still the hope of the world.  The only fault I could find with this book was that at times it seemed like they expected the reader to come in having at least a basic knowledge of the situations in many overseas countries. However, any novice political observer would still be able to quickly figure it out, as the explanations provide plenty of background to peice things together.  It is my belief that not only was this book a clear, brilliant explanation of the conservative point of view in the War on Terror, but that it is a book I wish every American could read, regardless of political affiliation.  Even if one does not agree with their well-stated and practical, common-sense solutions, they make the reality of this confict crystal clear.  I think sometimes we in America are quick to forget the larger, broader scope of this war.  Too often we get bogged down in partisan bickering and we lose sight of our common goal - the defeat of the militant Islamist movement and the triumph of the free, civilized world.  Consequently, I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to any American who wants to see a clear, well-planned strategy for victory.    Grade: A

      by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins    The ultimate series finale        Ever since the original  Left Behind  book first hit bookshelves worldwide, the series made it's mark on history as the fastest-selling adult fiction series ever.  Over 40 million copies of the first 11  Left Behind  books have been sold around the globe, and it has been translated into numerous languages.  The original novel in this end-times prophecy-based fiction series was followed up by more bestsellers:  Tribulation Force ,  Nicolae ,  Soul Harvest ,  Apollyon ,  Assassins ,  The Indwelling ,  The Mark ,  Desecration ,  The Remnant ,  Armageddon , and now, finally,  Glorious Appearing .  The  Left Behind  series chronicles the lives of characters who witness, in the first novel, the sudden and mysterious dissapearance of hundreds of millions of people around the globe.  As the world reels in shock after this event, some of them begin to realize that the dissapearances were in fact prophesied in the Bible - "the Rapture," where Jesus takes up to heaven all those people who believe in him - and that they, who are still on earth, have been left behind.  A few people quickly realize what has happened, and commit their lives to Christ.  The majority, however, are not convinced.  A one-world government is soon established, as most governments have been decimated by the dissappearances.  A treaty is signed between this government and Israel which ushers in a 7-year period phrophesied in the Bible called "the Tribulation."  The meaning of this label soon becomes apparent, as natural disasters of supernatural proportions begin occuring on a global scale that far surpass anything the world has ever seen before.  Judgements and calamities prophesied in various books of the Bible - mainly the book of Revelation - begin wreaking havoc and destruction on the earth.  Believers in Christ who were left behind at the Rapture are persecuted, imprisoned, tortured, and executed for their beliefs.  Most live as fugitives - some work undercover for the one-world government ruled by a man the Bible calls "the Antichrist." Each of the  Left Behind  novels brings the reader closer to the end of the 7-year Tribulation, at which time the Bible prophesies that Jesus will return again, in a spectacular event called the "Glorious Appearing."  Needless to say, the final book in the series details that return, as well as the final defeat of the Antichrist, his followers, and his army at the hands of Jesus Himself.  For me, these books provided an interesting and, I daresay, exciting rendition of the Biblical end-times prophesies.  Each book (maddeningly) finished with a cliffhanger ending, usually leaving the lives of one or more Tribulation Force (aka the good guys) members in jeaprody.   Glorious Appearing  was a decidedly different kind of story. Unlike the previous 11 books, there was no suspense, no nail-biting, no harrowingly close calls for the characters.  Not only does the reader know who wins in the end, but it isn't even a contest.  Calling the defeat of Nicolae Carpathia (the Antichrist) and his army a 'battle' is misleading.  It's more of a one-sided slaughter - not surprisingly; they're fighting Jesus, after all.  What this book does give the faithful  Left Behind  reader is a satisfying and heart-warming conclusion to a series of books dominated by death, destruction, despair, and heart-wrenching loss. The reunion between those characters who managed to survive all 7 years and those who died along the way (as well as those raptured at the beginning) is a touching finish - not to mention the reunion between each of the characters and Jesus Christ Himself, an interaction that was probably the most powerful and moving for any Christian reader - or, for that matter, anyone who had followed the trials, challenges, and hardships of the characters throughout the series.  I think it goes without saying that the books in the  Left Behind  series are the most successful and well-written end-times novels ever published.  I would highly reccommend the books to anyone interested in Biblical prophecy (as the authors weave much theological analysis into the fiction of the novels), as well as to anyone who is just looking for an exciting, suspensful series with action and characters that keep you turning the pages and make the books hard to put down--   --Yes, even though you know who wins in the end.   Grade: A-

      I will hopefully get around to posting something soon. Right now I'm reading Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" and Douglas R. Hofstadter's "Gödel,Escher,Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid" Both these books look promising. The majority of what I read and therefore post will be classics, both new and old, so don't expect anything like  urlLink this.

       I think Alex has been spying on me...How else would he know to set this up about five seconds after I finished Amy Tan's  The Kitchen God's Wife ?   The two other Tan books I've read are probably the two most famous/popular:  The Joy Luck Club  and  The Hundred Secret Senses . If I had to rank them,  Secret Senses  would be first by a wide margin and  Joy Luck  would be second by a nose. I must say, as some of my friends and I have discussed, that Tan occasionally goes a little to far in her portrayals. In this book, perhaps more so than in  Joy Luck , the imagery accompanying the husband's abuse of the wife is quite vivid. Without spoiling the book for everyone, it goes along you standard Amy Tan format: the narrator begins in the present day, the reader hears the tale of a character who was born in China, suffered there, and then came to America, and then the characters' relationship rises to a new level because of the fresh understanding they now have. It's a pretty neat format...until you've read it a few times (the same is the case for Harry Potter and the Redwall books). However, it lacks the some of depth of the multiple-character  Joy Luck  and the (relatively) tasteful restraint of  Secret Senses .   If you're an Amy Tan fan, this is a must-read. If you want to understand your Asian friends better, read one of her other two books first. My reaction to the book is one of tepid approval.   Grade: C

       For starters, I'd like to apologize to everyone, particularly our readers, our "Fearless Leader", and our  real  leader, for being such a complete slacker here recently. I hope I can make up for it by writing a phenomenal review (which it's not, so sorry again). In addition, I'd like to apologize for the lack of coherent writing style here. The reason for this is twofold: (1) I wrote this over the course of nearly two months, and (2) I'm exploring stylistically. Admittedly, the style used in this review is thoroughly unoriginal. Let me apologize for that as well.   Alrighty, so let's stop beating around the bush. And no, I don't mean it in a Whoopie Goldberg way, for all you dirty-minded perverts out there!     To prove to all that I attempt to be "fair and balanced", I followed up  LIES and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: a Fair and Balanced Look at the Right  with  Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism . Perhaps you ask yourself who I'm trying to fool. And, to tell the truth, the answer is nobody. In the process of reading these, I realized that it's impossible for  anyone  to be "fair and balanced" in the eyes of  everyone .     To appease any miffed readers, I'll write separate reviews on the book's literary quality and content. Two for the price of one! I'll give these in the order I read them.            LIES  by Al Franken      The good:      It was humorous. It was LOL-funny. It was ROFLOL-funny, in fact (just FYI, I don't use the "MAO" version, for reasons that should be obvious.). Even the offensive material was a tad bit funny. This guy is truly talented.      To that end, he had some good points to make, and he made them in a humorous manner. For example, in his criticism for Coulter, he parodied her endnote style (he uses footnotes instead) by burying a few endnotes in random places near the end of the book. Admittedly, when reading Coulter, most readers presumably do not check her endnotes (trust me, after reading this, I tried and gave up after about 50 pages), and those who  do  check them do not perform LexisNexis searches to confirm their validity.&nbsp; On the other hand, most people probably did not do LexisNexis searches even after Franken's accusations were released, since most people don't have LexisNexis subscriptions.&nbsp; How convenient....    The bad:    There was offensive material. You knew that one was coming :D Some of the jokes went overboard in other ways, including the Bob Jones University (BJU) one. While Franken admits the BJU incident, in which he assumed the guise of the father of one of TeamFranken's members, the pair plays with a school official who attempts to convince the "son" that BJU is the school for him by feigning interest in an aspect of BJU that he proceeds to ridicule the moment the official begins describing it.&nbsp; Like he admits himself, it was cruel.    It lacked focus and purpose. True, the book was all about "lies" of the political right, but there was a terrible tendancy to jump from one victim of his attacks or one type of "lie" to another. Perhaps this is a manifestation of Franken's background as a stand-up comedian. Unfortunately for Franken, writing cohesively is probably one of Coulter's greatest strengths.     And the worst charge that can be leveled against this book is that it is filled with lies itself. To refrain from boring you with the gory details (something Franken did  not  do in his criticism of Coulters  Slander ), here's a    urlLink  site   . There's also excessive profanity and hypocrisy in the book. For example, he complains about deceptive charts and graphs, and then he goes ahead and presents one as fact comparing the defense spending of Reagan, Clinton and the Bushes.    Grade: B-                  Treason  by Ann Coulter     The Good:    She makes excellent points supported by research, and she exposes many of the lies of the left, which is purportedly Franken's goal.&nbsp; Just read it; I don't want to spoil it for you.    This is probably the single book with the most quotes, allusions, and unreported stories that you make you want to look them up.&nbsp; I personally use index cards to take notes (I refuse to write in books.&nbsp; Besides, they double as excellent bookmarks!), and I filled both sides of three 3x5 cards in the process of reading this book.&nbsp; To date, I still have not looked into all of them personally.&nbsp; I suppose that could attribute that to my laziness though....     She's witty.&nbsp; Just read her   urlLink  weekly column   &nbsp; and you'll understand.&nbsp; (An excellent example from the most recent one: "  Wilson said only that his wife was not the one who made the decision to send him to Niger. This cleared up the matter for anyone who had been under the impression Wilson was married to George Tenet.  ")   Hey, guess what!&nbsp; She's funny too!      The Bad:    She can be repetitive.&nbsp; Sometimes, it's good for authors to repeat themselves a few times to emphasize arguments, but she has a tendancy to go to the extreme.&nbsp; Personally, I don't find it appropriate very often to beat a dead horse.&nbsp; Maybe I should go join PETA.    And, as Franken accuses, her endnotes are impossible to follow.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I attempted to do so as I read  Treason , but I gave up in about the second chapter.&nbsp; Speaking of chapters, her chapters are excruciatingly long in some instances.&nbsp; While Franken has chapters as short as a paragraph (the joke ones), all of Coulter's are about 40 pages long.&nbsp; The general audience has an attention span of about 10 pages (*hand waving alert*) per chapter.&nbsp; Anything more and     Grade: B+        All in all, I'd say read them both.&nbsp; Both are good reads, and it's always advisable to see both views, no matter which side of the fence you sit on.    And remember this:    They report.&nbsp; You decide.

        Surprisingly, sequel matches the hilarity of the original       I gotta admit: When I first saw the commercials for  Shrek 2,  I thought: "Oh God, not another horrible sequel trying to make $ of the success of the original."   However, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Instead of trying to drag out the laughs of the original, the makers of  Shrek 2  created a whole new, entertaining, and funny movie without having the jokes seem trite or overused.  The dozens of comedic references and spoofs on other movies were perfectly executed and well-done - none of it seemed forced or cheesy.  Taking cues from movies and TV shows such as  "Alien," "Mission: Impossible," "The Lord of the Rings," "Spider-Man," "King Kong," "It's a Wonderful Life," "The Mask of Zorro," "Cinderella," "Beauty and the Beast,"  "Cops," and the Oscars telecast, the movie cleverly wove elements of these classics into the engaging and entertaining storyline.  Another positive of  Shrek 2  was it's introduction of a host of new characters.  Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) parents, the King and Queen of the posh kingdom of Far Far Away (which looks eerily like Beverly Hills...) are played by John Cleese and Julie Andrews.  The pretty-boy, Brad Pitt-look alike Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) plays the son of the cruel, vengeful Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders).    The best new character, however, is without a doubt Puss in Boots - the Zorro-like Latin sword-slinging kitty perfectly voiced by Antonio Banderas.  His hilarious one-liners and classic Zorro attitude (not to mention his adorable, big-eyed kitten routine) are priceless.  For lovers of the original - do not fear - Shrek (Mike Myers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) still provide plenty of laughs.  Donkey's classic, irritatingly annoying pestering of Shrek and Fiona can still be found in the sequel, and Mike Myers' perfect execution of Shrek is dead-on - again.  All in all, I think it's fair to say if you liked the original -  Shrek 2  will not dissapoint.    Grade: B+

        Funny, witty, charming...another success for Spielberg       In this heartwarming and hilarious comedy, Spielberg weaves a captivating tale in his personal, characteristically great style.  The story takes place entirely inside of JFK International Airport. A man from a fictional Eastern European nation (called Krakhozia) named Viktor Nivorsky (Tom Hanks) lands in New York only to be ushered into the office of the airport supervisor, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci). Dixon explains to Viktor that while he was in the air, a coup occurred in his country and the government was overthrown.  Consequently, Viktor's passport is invalid until the new government is recognized.  Legally, he's a citizen of no country.  He, as Dixon explains, has fallen through a tiny crack in the system. He can't be let on to American soil, and he can't be returned to Krakhozia either. Dixon decides the only thing to do is have Viktor live in the terminal...indefinitely.  Hanks executes his character perfectly, playing the awkward yet persistent Nivorsky.  His broken English and Eastern European accent are great, proving that Hanks does indeed deserve the stardom status he has acquired. The supporting characters are also spectacular - the Indian floor-cleaner Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and his hilarious obsession with CIA plots to spy on them - the Hispanic food-service man (Diego Luna) who desperately enlists Viktor's help to woo a no-nonsense customs officer (Zoe Saldana).  And Viktor's interactions with Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) - the flight attendant with whom Viktor becomes enamored - also provide some hilarious and touching moments.   The viewer watches as Viktor figures out the way of life in the terminal, learns  English, meets new people, and experiences a little microcosm of America. His perserverence, hard work, and stubborn (and comical) determination in everything he does exemplifies the attitudes of many an immigrant to the U.S. over the centuries.  Spielberg masterfully blends comedy, romance, and drama in his trademark way, and makes you truly understand and empathize with the characters.  While I did find the ending a little disappointing, this was one of the best movies of the summer so far, in my humble opinion.     Grade: A-

        Sci-fi flick with an attitude       Vin Diesel returns as Riddick in this sequel to  Pitch Black  (2000), though the two stories are essentially unrelated. He's still the same hardcore fighting machine with those eerie glowing eyes and the ability to see in the dark. Riddick, an escaped convict with a price on his head, is chased by both bounty hunters and a man named Lord Marshall (Colm Feore). The latter is the leader of a sinister, pseudo-religious race called the Necromongers, whose armies are sweeping across the universe, giving the residents of each human world a choice: convert or die. You can see that Riddick's defiant, confident, and cocky attitude is going to make for a conflict with that strategy.  Marshall - a half-alive, half-dead being who has visited a shadowy "Underverse," (a sort of "promised-land" toward which the Necromongers are heading) and returned with dark powers - hunts Riddick because 30 years before he was told a prophecy that some day he would be brought down by a Furian, a race of men known for their fiery defiance and pride - Riddick is one of these. Marshall had long ago waged a war on the Furians' home world in order to rid himself of this threat, and has always lived in fear that some survivor might come for him.  Judi Dench (aka "M" of  James Bond  fame) shows up periodically as Aereon, a mysterious sage from a race called the Elementals, who shift in and out of mist form and are known for their ability at calculating and forecasting odds of future events happening. They can't see the future, per se, but they are pretty good at predicting it. It was Aereon who first came to Riddick to tell him that only he could stop the Necromongers from conquering the entire galaxy.  Factor into the equation Kyra (Alexa Davalos) - aka "Jack" from  Pitch Black , who Riddick left behind in the first movie and who has been searching for Riddick in the 5 years between movies. She killed a lot of people in that search and ended up in a subterranean prison on a broiling hot planet where temperatures in the sun reach 700 degrees (this is the kind of movie where you don't ask if that's Celsius or Farenheit). Riddick eventually finds her in that prison and is impressed by how well of a fighter she has become. When she's captured by the Necromongers, Riddick goes to free her - which leads to the inevitable showdown with Lord Marshall. And the ending isn't as predictable as you might think.  This was not a "great" movie. But it wasn't too bad, either. Yeah, the plot is a pretty shallow, and the story is mostly action-driven (it should be noted that it's really, really cool action) and the special-effects in the inter-planetary battles are stunning, there is something that one can come away with from this movie: Defiance in the face of evil, of not surrendering despite overwhelming odds. Viewers watch a sequence that exemplifies the power of the Necromongers, as their forces come to a planet (reminiscent of an Arab nation), wipe out it's defenses, destroy it's armies, and devastate the landscape - all in one night. The overwhelming force and strength of the Necromonger race leaves the viewer with little doubt as to the likely fate of the rest of the universe.  The captured humans from this planet are gathered into a room. A "Purifier" (Linus Roache) preaches a sermon to these captives, telling them they can become stronger, part of a better race if they bow and convert to the Necromonger religion. One man in the crowd shouts "We will never turn our backs on our own faith!" Lord Marshall responds by eerily reaching inside the man and ripping out his soul. At this display of power, every human in the room reluctantly kneels -- save one. Riddick stands at the back of the room. "This is your final chance!" warns Vaako. "Bow now or fall forever!" Riddick is unmoved: "I bow to no man," he responds.  Later, when Lord Marshall attempts to rip out Riddick's soul (like he did so easily to the aforementioned man), Riddick stares back defiantly with those eerie glowing eyes. Marshall struggles, with clenched teeth, but is unable to overcome Riddick's spirit of defiance.  Something about Riddick's defiance throughout the movie struck me as inspiring (actually probably the only inspiring aspect of the whole movie). The other interesting idea to mull over is one presented during Aereon's narration in the opening minutes of the movie, when she states: "Usually, we would fight this evil with good. But these are no ordinary times. To defeat this evil, we must fight it with...a different kind of evil." Now there's a philosophy to contemplate in this day and age.  Some characters in the movie are flat and predictable: Marshall, Vaako, and his wife Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), the sneaky, ambitious, power-hungry villaness. Kyra's character is semi-interesting, and her consuming desire to become as defiant and deadly as Riddick provides some diversion. Riddick's character is actually the best, and the one with the most depth - rare for a Vin Diesel role. The story is, of course, anything but believeable - it is sci-fi, after all. But it ain't half-bad, either.    Grade: C-

        Shallow plot, cliche dialouge, exaggerated and unrealistic storyline...but really good SFX.       Did anyone really expect this to be a great movie? Not really. It was billed as an exciting natural-disaster flick with amazing special effects - and that is exactly it was.  Just don't expect a lot more.  While the disaster sequences are truly spectacular - the multiple, gigantic tornadoes that devastate L.A. or the tidal wave/blizzard that wreaks havoc on New York City - the plot and characters are thin, flat, and cliche.  The main character, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is predictable and boring; the scientific crusader, who predicted it all, and fights against the indifferent and stubborn Vice President Becker (a Dick Cheney look-alike played by Kenneth Welsh).  Besides the fact that the whole premise for the movie - global warming causes catastrophic storms and the next Ice Age - is exaggerated and outlandish, the subplots provide no substance either.  The familiar family-in-turmoil story (Jack is separated from his wife, a doctor, and son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is on a school field trip in NYC) has been recycled for use in  Day After Tomorrow .  The predictable romance between Sam and fellow classmate Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) isn't exactly original either.  The story is filled with other events that are a little hard to believe.  Even after hundred-foot waves engulf NYC, and a gigantic blizzard drops dozens of feet of snow on top of that, a pack of wolves gets loose from a zoo (eyes rolling) and somehow survive to terrorize Sam, Laura, and the others at the New York City library, who burn books in a fireplace to keep warm (amazingly, that continues to keep them alive even after the temperatures drop to -150 degrees below zero...).    Jack also heroically decides to go out on foot, through the brutal blizzard and subzero temperatures, to look for his son - though you'd think, with all his government connections, he'd have been able to, say, fly a helicopter over the city instead...)  In conclusion though,  Day After Tomorrow  still manages to be entertaining movie despite it's flaws.  If you're looking for a fun, popcorn-munching flick to kick off your summer, this one will work nicely.    Grade: D+

        A Worthy Sequel       In this follow up to  The Bourne identity  (2002), Matt Damon returns as ex-CIA assassin Jason Bourne.&nbsp; The second in a spy thriller trilogy based on a fantastic set of books by Robert Ludlum, this film is at least as good as it's predecessor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with&nbsp;government agents with questionable allegiance, shady dealings in darkened Langley rooms, ruthless contract killers, nonstop&nbsp;mystery and intrigue, and heart-pounding action, this movie proves not all sequels are disappointments.   The movie opens in Doa, India (the first of many exotic locations the viewer is swept through during the film) where Bourne is living a quiet life with his girl, Marie, and still trying to figure out his past.&nbsp; Haunted by fragments of dreams he cannot piece together, Bourne's true identity and past are still unknown to him.&nbsp; Soon, however, his past catches up with him, as he is again hunted by an assassin, who he believes is part of the now-defunct top-secret CIA Treadstone Project.   Certain events lead Bourne to go on one last mission -- for revenge -- and to put an end to the endless game of cat-and-mouse he has been playing for 2 long years.&nbsp; He no longer takes orders from anyone: his only mission is to stay alive.&nbsp; Everyone, it seems, is trying to kill him.&nbsp; He soon learns this latest aggression directed against him comes from a double&nbsp;murder in Berlin. Two CIA operatives, performing a mission to receive classified materials,&nbsp;were executed by an unknown assassin. A fingerprint -&nbsp;Bourne's -&nbsp;has been discovered at the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Even though Bourne was thousands of miles away in India at the time and is convinced he is again being set up, he has to face the&nbsp;wrath&nbsp;of&nbsp;a CIA team out to hunt him down, led by a&nbsp;chillingly motivated Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).&nbsp; Aided by none other than the aging, ominous Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), Landy and her team trek across the globe to cities like Berlin and Moscow in search of Bourne.&nbsp; Landy is determined to capture Bourne alive and find&nbsp;the truth&nbsp;about the Treadstone project (Abbott, not surprisingly, is not forthcoming with such information).&nbsp; Abbott, on the other hand, is determined to "close the case once and for all" -- meaning he wants Bourne dead ASAP.&nbsp;   The movie is&nbsp;mostly devoid of warmth (excepting some scenes at the&nbsp;beginning and end).&nbsp; But strangely, that aspect just makes&nbsp;the film&nbsp;that much better.&nbsp; The cold, ruthless nature of all the characters make the movie even more fun and exciting&nbsp;to watch.&nbsp; It's entertaining to watch Bourne continue to dodge death and outwit his enemies.&nbsp;   Matt Damon isn't exactly&nbsp;my favorite actor (meaning I don't really like him), but I must admit he is still perfect for the role of Jason Bourne.&nbsp; The characters in this movie aren't really spectacular, but who cares -- it's the cool, twisting, intriguing plot that makes the movie worth seeing.&nbsp; The story and heart-pounding action keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and rarely lets go.&nbsp;     Grade: A-

        This film's got plenty of 'intelligence'        Supposedly, this movie is based on the classic science-fiction short story of the same name by Isaac Asimov.&nbsp; In reality, there aren't many similarities between the two.&nbsp; But I don't think anyone really cares.  &nbsp;  The movie takes place in Chicago in the year 2035.&nbsp; Robots, all manufactured by the corporate giant U.S. Robotics (USR) have become integrated into every part of humans' daily lives.&nbsp; Robots are seen walking dogs, working as trash collectors, FedEx deliverymen, bartenders, and a host of other occupations.&nbsp; The robots were&nbsp;initially&nbsp;designed by&nbsp;the brilliant scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who also laid out the 3 Laws of Robotics, which are, in shortened form: 1) Robots must not harm human beings, 2) Robots&nbsp;must obey humans, except when it violates the first law and 3) Robots must protect themselves, unless doing so would violate the the first two laws.&nbsp; These three laws are hardwired into every USR robot's positronic brain, and at the opening of the&nbsp;movie, no robot anywhere in the world has ever committed a crime.&nbsp; Perfect system, right?  &nbsp;  Yeah, you can see where this is going.  &nbsp;  Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a lonely and&nbsp;somewhat egotistical&nbsp;Chicago Police detective who has never liked robots.&nbsp; He is uneasy around, and has an inherent distrust of robots, a feeling whose roots are discovered later in the film.&nbsp; The movie begins with Spooner being called to the scene of an apparent suicide -- that of the illustrious Dr. Lanning, who supposedly jumped out of his office window at USR headquarters and fell to his death 30 stories below, just a few short days before USR is supposed to deploy their new NS-5 robot -- the largest robotic distribution in history.&nbsp; The viewer learns that Smith knows Dr. Lanning from somwhere (also explained later in the film) and that Lanning had left instructions for Spooner to be called in the event of his death.&nbsp; Of course, Spooner&nbsp;is not&nbsp;buying the theory that&nbsp;Lanning's death was a suicide, and is convinced that robots were responsible, to the annoyance of the stiff, cold USR psychiatrist and robot expert Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and the distant, arrogant USR CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) who insist robots "could never do such a thing."  &nbsp;  Spooner, however, is proven right when a unique&nbsp;robot named Sonny attacks him in Dr. Lanning's office and attempts to escape, much to the horrified disbelief of Dr. Calvin, who witnesses the "malfunction," as she calls it.&nbsp; Sonny is now sure that he has been right all along about the robots, and eventually learns that something is horribly wrong with the NS-5s.&nbsp; And time is running out -- the robots are set to fulfill Dr. Lanning's lifelong dream -- after the&nbsp;impending robot distribution, a robot&nbsp;will be in every home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  First of all, the special effects in this movie are second to none.&nbsp; The film seamlessly flows between live action and computer-generated scenes with ease.&nbsp; The robots, of course, are the best&nbsp;of the latter aspect, and this is only enhanced by their amazingly cool fight sequences (the robots know some pretty neat martial arts, too).&nbsp; There are some sweet-looking&nbsp;cars and guns, too.  &nbsp;  Also, the movie never becomes dark or foreboding, but manages to be exciting, heart-pounding, and just downright fun.&nbsp; The movie never takes itself too seriously, but that's not to say it doesn't leave you with&nbsp;plenty to think about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question&nbsp;"what does it means to be human?" is&nbsp;an issue Sonny struggles with throughout the movie.&nbsp; Other themes - free will (a big one) as well as the&nbsp;line between artificial intelligence and&nbsp;personhood&nbsp;- are excellently written into the script.&nbsp; In other words -- the movie isn't all brawn and no brains.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Admittedly, there are some cliche, cheesy characters - Spooner's boss (Chi McBride) is a the stereotypical police supervisor who buys the official 'suicide'&nbsp;story and keeps telling Spooner to knock off the pesky investigating stuff.&nbsp; The movie could have done without Spooner's annoying&nbsp;teenage street-punk&nbsp;friend Farber (Shia LaBoeuf) (I was almost hoping one of the rogue NS-5s would, ahem, put him out of his misery)&nbsp; and his overly-sugary-sweet&nbsp;grandmother (Adrian Ricard) -- I left the theatre asking myself why the heck they were even in the movie at all.  &nbsp;  Overall, though,  I, Robot  is definitely a standout in the summer entourage of mostly forgettable movies. Definitely worth seeing.     Grade: B

        This classic - disappointing       I must say, the previews for this movie looked great. I was hoping it would be another awesome movie along the lines of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's big hit  Pirates of the Caribbean.  No such luck.  The movie never got off the ground. It seemed like the audience was always waiting for the movie to really get started...But it never did.  At least the plot is original. Though you might think all the possible twists on the King Arthur legend have been explored already, this version serves up one more. It is set much earlier than usual (this one at the latter stages of the Roman Empire), and contains none of the mythological or supernatural elements of many versions. In it, Arthur (Clive Owen) is a half-British, half-Roman military commander leading a group of elite knights taken from their homeland and forced to serve 15 years in the Roman military at Hadrian's Wall. They complain about the English weather, which was even drearier back in the fifth century, but their devotion and allegiance to Arthur is absolute. They are on the eve of finishing their term of service when it is learned that the Saxons have invaded Britain and that a Roman family in the north needs rescuing. So, Arthur and his knights ride out one last time, only to learn the man they go to rescue isn't worth saving. A sniveling, pompous fat cat Roman aristocrat and his family (though his wife and son are good people) run an estate on which a sinister operation is conducted. The "heathen pagans" are tortured and kept in a dark, twisted dungeon until they convert to Christianity or die - which rightly disgusts Arthur, who plays the only true Christian in the film. One of the prisoners turns out to be the warrior Woad (aka native Briton) Guinevere (Kiera Knightley) who is freed by Arthur.  Cerdic, the Saxon leader, is played by Stellan Skaarsgard, whose low-key, hoarse delivery and non-chalant attitude are played well and make him enjoyable to watch. Cerdic's lieutenant is his son Cynric (Til Schweiger), who shows some signs of challenging his father's authority and sports a neat little braided soul patch and a shaved head. Some of Arthur's knights are played well, notably Bors (a lusty, cantankerous, hulk of a knight played by Ray Winstone), and Tristan (played by a mysteriously enigmatic Mads Mikkelsen).  Owen's portrayal of Arthur is the strongest character in the film, as his seeming reluctance to fully commit all of his charisma and passion to a cause he still does not fully understand makes him refreshingly vulnerable. Ms. Knightley, on the other hand, hurls her full passion into every scene (especially the battle sequences).  The film's best sequence is not the final battle (Which is anti-climactic, lackluster, and boringly predictable), but rather a cool little skirmish on a frozen lake of ice between a 200-man Saxon company lead by Cynric and Arthur's handful of knights (with the addition of Guinevere, who, it is learned, can fight pretty well.) The fact that her bulls-eye arrow shooting skills come literally a few cinematic minutes after her badly broken fingers are painfully popped back into place by Arthur...well, don't try to think about that too much.  The expected love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot is nearly ignored. It seems as though the writers wanted to put it in there, but aside from a single longing glance at Guinevere by Lancelot and the cliche bedroom scene with Arthur and Guinevere on the night before the big battle, the romance is basically sucked out of the movie.  Most of the set design and cinematography is well-done - as usual for Bruckheimer - but sometimes the big castle/wall scenery seemed a little too fake and empty, not rich or full enough to be realistic.  All in all, the film was disappointing. It was lacking something...and I think I now realize what that was: coherence, harmony...but most of all, it lacked true feeling. It was hard to get into this movie, if you know what I mean. Some movies are so full of feeling and passion and great characters that you cannot help but be drawn into them. Not so with this one - you are always acutely aware that you are a spectator in this film.    Grade: C+

        Way better than the original       This is a rare sequel - it far, far surpasses the quality of the original  Spider-Man  - and perhaps even all other superhero movies to date.  Surprisingly, the movie's strongest point is not the special effects or the fight scenes (those are actually the weakest part), but rather the strong characters and depth and maturity shown in the film.  The main plot is, well, about what you'd expect from a comic book, but aside from the main story, smaller details give the movie a more human, personal quality.  For instance, the movie opens with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) being fired from his pizza-delivery job, behind on the rent for his tiny, dirty apartment, and failing in his studies at Columbia.  This portrayal of Peter Parker as not an invincible, aloof superhero, but rather a very human, flawed individual is one of many great aspects of character depth in  S2.   And life gets worse for poor Peter.  Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is still grieving over the loss of her husband, Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and in danger of losing her house.  Peter's lifelong love, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is fed up with what she sees as Peter's continued selfishness, excuses and unreliability. Worse yet for Peter - Mary Jane gets engaged to an astronaut (Bill Nunn) who happens to be the son of the cranky, blustery John Jameson - editor of the  Daily Bugle,  who continues to malign and mock Spider-Man daily.  Harry Osborn is still obsessed with finding Spider-Man and making him pay for what he sees as his father's murder, and he also finances a dangerous fusion project run by Doctor Otto Octavius which goes horribly wrong and leaves Octavius a widower and a mutant - connected to artificially-intelligent mechanical legs with sinister minds of their own.  The main focus of the film, happily, is not the action, but the drama, the characters' inner struggles and interactions.  Tobey Maguire delivers a perfect, adorable, sometimes comical portrayal of superhero/goofy science nerd Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst's mature, more grown-up portrayal of Mary Jane is also another highlight.  The best part of the movie is the theme - the conflict between duty and responsibility on the one hand, and your lifelong dreams on the other. Peter is continually faced with the struggle between feeling the responsibility of using his superhero gifts to save people and his longing and passion to be with Mary Jane - two things he believes he cannot have at the same time.  He thinks if he gets with Mary Jane, her life will be endangered (his enemies will go after her) and he doesn't want to put her in that position.  That conflict is the strongest facet and most important aspect of the entire movie, in this writer's opinion.    I definitely recommend the movie to all -- not your typical shallow summer action flick at all.    Grade: A

        Suspense master M. Night Shyamalan delivers again        From the dark mind of writer, director, and producer M. Night Shayamalan ( The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs ),  The Village  is an deeply powerful and suspenseful thriller - complete with Shayamalan's highly entertaining, trademark plot twists - that keeps you guessing until the end -- well, almost.  While the surprise ending isn't really all  that  surprising, it is still enough to make you grin from the sheer cleverness of this superbly written story.  Set in an isolated nineteenth-century village in the Pennsylvania woods, the members of this remote community are terrorized by mysterious creatures from the woods.  Referred to as "those who we don't speak of" by the villagers, there are strict rules -- "Never enter the woods -- that is where they wait." And, "Let the bad color not be seen -- it attracts them." The bad color, of course, is red - evoking blood and violence - and this color symbolism is used brilliantly by Shayamalan throughout the film.    The film does an excellent job of building the suspense about the lurking, unseen creatures that inhabit the woods near the village.  To venture outside the village, members need permission from the village elders -- led by Edward Walker (William Hurt) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) -- which they refuse to grant.  The quiet, shy, yet courageous Lucius Hunt's (Joaquin Phoenix) request to venture to "the towns" for medicines is denied.  Only Ivy Walker (a masterful debut performance by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director Ron Howard) - a blind girl whose innocence, wit and spirit make her one of the film's best characters - is given permission to travel through the woods, because...well, there's no fun in spoiling the surprise.  The love story involving Lucius and Ivy is played with heart-warming delicacy by Phoenix and Howard.  Adrien Brody's excellent portrayal of the bizarre, mentally disturbed Noah Percy, who makes up the third part of a love triangle involving Lucius and Ivy, is also noteworthy.  The film deals with the isse of fear and how it can manipulate - and this deeper, allegorical theme gives the film a chilling weight that will stay with you even after the goose bumps fade away.   The Village  is   almost completely devoid of special effects and computer animation - unlike  Signs  - it builds up the suspense and tension the old-fashioned way - with superb cinematography from guru Roger Deakins and, of course, excellent directing by Shyamalan.   The Village  is one of those movies that haunts your dreams not because of the scary creatures in it -- they really aren't all that scary -- but because the film has a subtle creepiness that makes your skin crawl.  My advice: See the movie...but not alone.    Grade: A
