      Hello all!  Today is my and my husband's first wedding anniversary.  It has been a wonderful year.  I could not askf or more, well, maybe if we won the lottery.  They say the first year is the hardest, but ours really wasn't.  We had been together for 5 years before he proposed, so we had already been through the usual relationship changes, ups & downs, etc.  The only change was that we were living together.  As my husband says, "this wasn't nearly as bad as everyone said it would be."  Typical man, I suppose.  We are insanely happy & enjoy our life together.  Tonight we are going to a surprise dinner at a nice restaurant (surprise because I don't know where we're going) & then it's home to eat a reproduction of our cake topper.  We didn't keep ours last year because we didn't have freezer space & really, who wants to eat year-old cake anyways?  So my sweet husband had a reproduction made.  I am very happy with him right now.  Can you tell?  :)  Well, all is well at the Happy Place.  See you next time!  Jen

      Hello & welcome to my happy place!  :)  There's lots of sunshine going on around here.  I have already shared my happiness with everyone around me, so it's off to the web I go to find other people to join the craziness.    My name is Jennifer.  I'm 27, live in an 86-year-old house in a historic Dallas neighborhood with my wonderful husband Justin.  We have collected some stray pets over the years & now have 2 cats - Jezebel (Jezzy) & Josephine (Josie).  Do you detect a J theme here?  We have 2 dogs - Brody (J. Brody as I like to call him, J thing) & Battie (J. Battie).  I am a merchandise analyst for a craft store corporate office and Justin is an IT project manager for a cell phone company.  I have a BS in Information Systems & Management Sciences (why don't I work in IT, I'll tell you later).  I am pursuing my MBA with emphasis in marketing & will graduate in May 2005.  It can't get here soon enough.  Justin has a BA in Political Economy, an MBA with emphasis in IT & entrepreneurship & will be starting a part-time evening law school program this fall.  Apparently we can't get enough education.  I am no longer in the IT industry because I didn't like it.  The theory was that's where the money was, but seriously, money doesn't matter when you don't like what you're doing.  So I am in retail, which is where my passion lies.  I am completely & totally fascinated with everything retail.  Strange, I know.  I love to do crafts, mainly cross-stitch.  Unfortunately since I'm in school I don't have as much time as I'd like to do them, but that will change next year.    So there's some info on me.  I will be discussing & posting random stuff, well, because that's what blogs are for.  Feel free to bask in the sunshine with me.  Jen

      No, I am not a daily blogger.  I don't have time or desire to be.  I guess I don't know whether I should post regular old humdrum daily life stuff.  Plus, some of my opinions could be misinterpreted or read by the wrong people, so some of the interesting stuff I just don't post.   On conception  OK, the feelings have been here all week & I have to share.  It will be brief.  Here goes....you are required to have a driver's license to drive.  You must have some knowledge of the effect you could have on the road & other people's lives.  Why do we not require some kind of license to conceive.  When conceiving a child you are affecting someone's life.  Your behavior & decisions cause behaviors & characteristics & life & death in another person.  Why can't we require some knowledge before allowing people to procreate?   Learning styles  My professor insists that students learn via a method called interactive learning, where students are involved in class discussions & critical thinking is involved.  Fine, whatever, I agree.  What I don't agree with is when the teacher is not involved at all & the students are practically teaching the class.  FYI, 3 students doing presentations on the same exact chapter does nothing for me but waste my time.   This Weekend  I'm looking forward to a lovely weekend, an end to a long week.  We have fun plans, like going to Lone Star Park to watch the horses run, celebrating a couple of our friends who got married yesterday & celebrating my mom's birthday & Father's Day!  Have a good weekend! Jen

      So apparently it's hard to keep a blog up.  Since last time I have found out much news.  My youngest sister is pregnant again & my middle sister is very close to getting engaged.  Lots of fun stuff going on in my family right now.  I also started summer school & my teacher is HORRIBLE.  Several students, including me, have begun writing letters to the head of the marketing research department to complain.  We'll see what happens.  Other random stuff, we had a lovely weekend.  We did lots of yardwork, ate yummy dinners & just enjoyed being off work.  Of course it flew by though.  Work has been boring lately, as our systems were continuously down last week, leaving me & my coworkers bored.  On a brighter note, I am on call for district jury duty & was supposed to go today, but they cancelled the trial.  Maybe they'll call me today.  I actually enjoy jury duty.  I did it last year for city court & it was an enlightening experience.  The lawyers actually get up and say, "I object" like they do on Law & Order.  No, really, I'm not naive, but I've never seen it before.  ;)  I was there for 3 days & it was a personal injury case.  It was very interesting.  And hey, I'm one of those people who enjoys random days off to do other things.  Oh, & this weekend I also posted stuff for sale on ebay.  Click  urlLink here  to see the items!  Have a happy day!

      Yesterday I had the job of spending some time with a couple of our friends, Ryan & Cecilia, who had a baby boy yesterday.  Cece was induced yesterday morning.  I got there around 5:30-ish & she was still in labor.  The contractions weren't coming very quickly & the whole thing was very slow-going.  Apparently as soon as I showed up & started talking with Cece, the contractions started coming big & strong.  Ryan's mom seems to think I'm some sort of miracle worker.  Maybe I should make a career out of talking babies out of their mothers' wombs.   Hmmmmmm....  Unforunately I had class last night, so I had to leave around 7pm, which was when the baby was crowning.  Ryan's mom announced that the baby had hair & with that I had to leave.  Justin & I received a phone call from Ryan last night announcing that little Jacob Ryan had made it into the world & was 7 lbs & some odd ounces.  :)  Very neat!  Jen

      Today marks my first day of summer school & I must remind myself that this is my last summer.  This time next year I will be finished w/ my MBA.  No more school PERIOD.    This summer it's Marketing Research & the class is on Mondays & Wednesdays from 8pm to 10:20pm.  10:20pm?  Geez, when am I supposed to sleep?  And then when I go to bed late, how am I supposed to get up early for work, be productive & maintain some time with my husband?  Do school administrators think about this?  I know - suck it up.  I chose to be here.  I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue postgraduate studies, I am not pleased that I goofed off so much during undergrad that I had to retake many of my classes in grad school.  :|  That's how it works though.  On a lighter note, my sweet husband is taking me to dinner & a musical on Friday w/ another couple.  We are seeing Miss Saigon.  He makes me happy!  :X  Jen
