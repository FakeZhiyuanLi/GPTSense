      Q.: do penguins have knees?  ~thanx~ ~beth~  A. : well beth thats one i never really thought about since well my friend, mr. gallopagus, in the south pole, wrestled a killer penguin (they are not all cute...) and wont be able to go bac and live with the penguins for a while...so i had to do hours of research. and it turns out that penguins sure do have knees, although they are discretely hidden underneath their feathers.   Penguins, like other birds, have legs divided into three segments. The upper segment, the equivalent of our thigh, and the middle segment, the equivalent of our shinbone, or the drumstick of a chicken, are both quit short in penguins.  When we see flamingos, or other birds with long legs, they appear to possess a knee turned backwards, but these are not the equivalent of a human knee. Penguins, flamingos, and other birds do have knees, with patellas (knee caps) that bend and function much like their human counterparts.   Penguins are birds, of course, but their element is water rather than sky. Penguins may waddle on land, but their legs help make them swimming machines. Penguins use their wings as propellers in the water, and their elongated feet act as rudders.  So rest assured. Even if you can't see them, penguins have legs (with knees). And they know how to use them.  p.s. thank you ask jeeves and john vineyard of plano, texas for all this info. ;)

      43. are they trying to kill you?  when you eat the whole box, you could easily die of salt poisoning or some as-of-yet unknown scientifical ailment that makes you break out in giant furry bumps with purple blotches that you can't see because your bumps are just so furry!  You have to soak in ketchup to treat it, but it still won't cure it, so you live your life in ketchup-soaked misery.  btw, brackish means somewhat salty.

      16. i don't know about your school, but at mine constantly in cafeteria study hall the lunch ladies are howling and laughing and screaming about what seems like nothing.  and then, they disappear behind a mysterious door in the kitchen.  i think it's their party room.  i mean what else  could  they be doing back there?  making burgers?  i don't think so, because our burgers are what fast food spits on.  not those nice homemade, wholesome burgers with love in every bite.

      14. how's becomes shoes, rubberbands, gumdrops, and such don't come with warrantees (guarantees for maggie)?  they need to come with insurance, too.  sometimes, your gumdrops gets lint on it without anybody telling you, and you pop it into your mouth unsuspecting.  and sometimes, shoes get muddy from stepping in puddles or on your little brother's face or something, and nobody's there to fix 'em.  and what about rubberbands?  those things snap on ya, and they  hurt!!   who's gonna be there when my rubberband snaps, and i can't shoot it any more, and i have a huge welt on my forehead??

       hello my ppl! how art thou? i am fine and dandy. today i shall write in my blog  about happy things although they may becum saddened but never fear for the happy shall prevail.  anyways since last time i stayed home a day and cleaned and then the next day i cleaned again so i could go to my cousins' house (adam evan and emily) and i stayed there for pretty much until this saturday.  we camped out in evan's tent in the woods about 20 yards away from the house and my aunt jamie said she would give us until 10:30 PM and me and adam were like yeh right.... but the other two were scared over nothing because they watch too many CSI and other Cop showz so i had to walk them back up to the house at 9:30 and that waznt so bad b-cuz i always need a drink of water before bed( dont ask it is a habit). i walked the spooky 20 yards to the tent alone with my glass of water and unzipped the tent. i set my drink down and climbed in and knocked ovr my whole glass of water. krap. i couldnt go bac up b-cuz that would be forfit.  so me and adam camped out in the tent and  i fell asleep at about 1:00 AM and he fell asleep about 11:00 PM so it waz okay. we woke up about 6:00(i really had to pee) and packed up sum stuf and went in at 6:30(6:37 to be exact). we told evan and emily and aunt jamie that we had to get up in the middle of the night to fight a racoon that was trying to get in. we told them that we hit it with a bat and then i smothered it with an air matress and adam hit it a couple more timez and we threw it ovr the cliff.(they have a small cliff in their backyard)they believed us. lol. how stupid.  after that we went swimming at my grandma linda's  and we opened up a dance, party, candy store, snowcone sumthing in their basement. it was open for 3 days then i came home on saturday and i went to kennywood with my mom, david, steve, aunt jamie, evan, adam, emily and todd aunt jamie's boyfriend/friend/sumthing. we had fun and i got cheesy fries and a funnel cake. lol. inside joke. we didnt get to ride the exterminator. o well.   yesterday i slept all day and waited for steve to get off of the internet but he never did.......  i am proud to announce that my aunt had her new baby boy on thursday june 24 2004. his name is Brody Jackson. Brody means brother and Jackson means son of Jack which is a form of John which means God is Gracious, Merciful. and i will probably get to see him in a week or so in which i will visit them and probably spend a day or so.   i think i will go to my grandpa jerry's soon or sumwhere else. i might go see a movie with steve and his girlfriend, kelly, today if he ever gets up. probably garfield. i am gonna see if i can get a hold of one of my friends today........adios!

       hey it has been another little while... well i didnt get to go to my dads until this weekend and cornflakes was there. we went fishing on fathers day.  we gave dad a pocketwatch and a dopey the dwarf doll (reminded us of him) before that i got to go to maggie's house. i weeded at her house too and we got a mailbox from wally world. and we got silver sharpies (SHARPIES R-U-L-E!!!!) and WE did some other stuffs 2.i made her a couple cds and i think that pretty much wraps it up except that i went to my grandma marilyn's before my dads and me and my cousin Karl and steve went to china banquet and we left 2 $ and a fake  $1,000,000 bill for a tip. my aunt didnt have her baby yet so darn...and WE shunned steve but thats it ttyl byes!

       whats up guys? its been a couple of days (this is a long post so stay reading!)and i have been at my cousins' house.(they're computer's internet connection is currently down.) and at my grampa jerry's with my cousins.(his computer is lacking internet mucho)      i was swimming at my grandpa's house because the pool is relaxing and is finally above the freezing temp. me and my cousins [adam(12), evan(10), and emily(8)] started a business, as usual, this time it was a candy store called candy corner or in french, la boulangerie du bonbon. dont ask about the french thing, evan thinks it sounds good so he made us have a french version of the menu too but we told him that there was no point since nobody in our family speaks fluent french(we had to go to  urlLink freetranslation.com  to figure it out)  anyway we had sum candy that even if we did have customers and sold it, it would probably end up being illegal, and we have a snow cone machine and so we sold snow cones, too. we made our own grape flavor out of koolaid and a lot of suger, and we used the store-bought flavors too.  one of my grampa's neighbors john gave us $1 but didnt buy anything, and there were sum visiting kids who live across the street that ordered 4 snow cones, at 15cents a piece, which brought their total to 60cents, but the guy gave us 1$ and said to keep it, and our grampa had so little faith in us that at the beginning he said that he would double our profits so our candy shop ended up with 4$ total profits. pretty pathetic, huh? well we each got 10% so i made a dollar.  whoopee. i guess its better than nuthin right?   so about the businesses me and evan usually think up different things for a business because they have like everything you need to do stuf with. so one time we made a hotel, sumtimes it is restaurants, drive-thrus, stores, whatever and sumtimes we make like a 2 in 1 thing like hotel and shop or an arcade and day care center or movie theatre and a fine restaurante ya know? but it is always more work than its worth as far as setting up and taking down. plus we always end up fighting because emily is always the customer and why cant  she be an employee for a change and why doesnt evan stop barking out orders and put in his own effort  on the dirty work and adam didnt wanna play in the first place so why should he now? c'mon we are only human!  so then at their house i was weeding their flowerbeds which believe me their weeds are really like trees in a past life or sumthing. and now im bac home and i have to give my aunt kathy a call cuz she is about to have a baby boy. that wil make three boys, grant(12), tucker(3), and new baby (unborn).o which reminds me i need to ask her what names they gots in mind. i think "chase" might be good or "cooper" i have to think about it. and i might go to my dad's tomorrow so it depends on my internet access in the next couple of days.  c ya!

       hey i am here at work with my uncle cuz i dont want to be stuck at his house with my brother. besides he doesnt have a computer at his house. david's graduation was great... he didnt moon anybody or anything. stephen found david's shoes, but he then didnt have anything to wear because he normally wears david's shoes since they rarely go to "dress shoe occasions" together so my mom ended up having to buy stephen new shoes but that was okay because i got some to :D. anyways that pretty much takes care of...thursday was it? o that brings me to yesterday when i didnt know what day it was because i have been staying up all night on the computer (typing in my blog actually) and sleeping for half the day. until yesterday when we (steve and mee) went to my uncle jerry's house. now i am at a preston dodge dealership and here i am typing to whoever will read it. by the way i would like to thank the people who have commented on my blogs especially that one person who has commented the most (you know who you are). well i guess i am just starting to get used to summer vacation. and it better not rain all summer or so help me pete, i'll...i'll....well you know. i hope you do at least.....o well....i think im gonna start a new blog called ask alex where you can ask me stuff and i will answer. i am gonna have to work out some kinks though so stay tuned!

       today was the last day of school. we got out at about 10:30. so here i am and i think it is weird that yet again i am getting ready  for something. this time it is for david's graduation. its at 7:00. stephen is sitting here playing playstation and getting mad at the game (like always). he is probably going to kick me off soon cuz he is getting mad. o well i dont care as long as i get to work on this post. my mom is home. she just walked in. she is angry with stephen cuz he wont look for david's dress shoes. now they are yelling. i better wrap this up pretty soon. it could get ugly...lol...just kidding. today at school i passed out notecards to everyone telling them to visit my blog. o krap i gotta go...my mom.
