						   last night I went to this club called Moscows, with Carl and Franchesca (kevin made a brief appearance before being driven home by carl) and Cathy was there, boy did she look HOT!! anyway, I ended up driving one of the other girls home and I think she wanted me, cuz she always looked at me when she talked and also...she looked like she wanted to kiss me when I dropped her off...:-) would've been funny, though she is a bit obnoxious, but so was fran last night. she didn't get anywhere with her even though she called dibs, LOL. so we might go out again tonight...we'll see how dave's status is.  speaking of david, he might be coming home later than expected. and I'm quite unhappy about it. if he comes home later, we may not be able to go on that cruise, but mostly, I'm unhappy because he's not going to be home on time. I already miss him lots.  anyway, now I have to think of a name for my gmail acct that Kirk was so nice to give me :-) how about DaveandRuby? or RubyDave? I was thinking of getting an acct name that we could use for correspondance with family and friends, easier to say than underscore and all that.   now all I have to do is get in touch with dave and see whats going on with him.

						   having woken up at 6:30am (the usual time) I spent an hour or two cleaning the house before heading out to Bally's. brought along some stuff to return at the mall, hoping I'd be able to withstand an hour of vigorous exercise and make it there when they open.  happily, I did exercise for over an hour, cardio workouts. however, my timing was off and the Limited was not yet open when I got there. instead, I ended up buying protein (for shakes) and a pretty damn expensive pillow. but I'm optimistic that the pillow will cure my neck and upper back pains. if not, I have 90days to get a refund. so we'll see.  it's odd that it's only 12pm and I'm ready for a nap. actually, no, not odd at all. I think I'll go nap :-) hahaha and then get to work on ASP afterward, that way I can test drive that pillow. when in doubt, take a nap.

						   this being my "very" first blog entry, I have surprisingly not a whole lot to say...  I guess it's more of a Welcome to my World! or is it Enter if you Dare!?   anyway, david has just left for california for the better part of next week. and now I'm left alone to my own devices, mwahahaha... it'll be the "get off my fat ass and get back into the gym" week, so that I can look myself in the mirror again without heaving that great BIG sigh, girls know what I'm talking about.  on a different note, I definitely am going to throw myself into ASP.NET now that I have the time and energy to devote to this new venture. hopefully it pays off and I dont have to feel like a fool for dropping a slightly less than mediocre job for unemployment. well, I feel tons better already now that I know I dont have to go back into HIPA on monday.
