       i'm doing it again.   i'm complaining too much and i feel like an ungrateful little shit.   i'm have second thoughts though and i just don't know what to do and for the first time i feel like i'm not in control. i feel like i'm whirling around and it feels like everything is always spinning and it's never been like this before and i just want it to stop and i want it to stop now; i just don't know how to.   i don't know if i wanna date him or go back to sulking all the time..gosh..i'm confused.       ".....so here i go...scream my lungs out and try to get to you...you are my only one....."

       i have been kissed  it's nice.. even if it's  only chocolate . i love  cold water -pray for my return my return to  sanity   i'm watching zim six minutes from now and it's a guarantee that i will quote every word    -+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-    i have realized it's   not   all   my   fault. i   didn't deserve   any of the things that he said or any of the things he did. i can't blame myself, even if i do feel bad. if only i had said no, and refused to let him think it was all his idea.

       I got an email from BJ today and it made me so happy...it just made my day.  i decided i'm   not   giving  him  the note. i will take it and put it in my emo binder and hide it in a cardboard box in the back of my closet where only i can find it.  i love the smell of my perfume and the way it hangs in the air.  thinking of the way people smell...i hope the smell of my perfume forever haunts   him  .   he   was behind me in the hall today and i ran into him   (literally)   and i hope he could smell the scent and remember what it was like to smell it in my hair and on my neck. i remember how he used to smell and i wonder if he still smells the same...  i wonder if i'm being  too obsessive  about this whole thing. i need to let it all go and move on like he obviously has.  i think i've said all i can say right now. nothing else i have to say has any meaning at all right now. it's a wonder i can stand up to all the pressure.  ...hasta luego...

       here's the letter i wrote today. i didn't give it to  him  but i wanted to. i just didn't have the courage. i'm  afraid.       -------------------------------------------------------      I don't know how to tell you what I need to say. I   have   been acting like a child. I said things I shouldn't have said, and    I'm sorry   . If i were you, I don't know how I'd ever forgive me. Lon said something to me the other day, and it made me realize that I've been acting very immature. Now I realize why. You hurt me with some of the things you said and I wanted to hurt you back. Now, I completely understand if you're extremely pissed off and you never want to look at me again (because let's face it-we pretty much aren't speaking). But the thing Lon said made me realize that maybe I don't feel the way I thought I felt. I   don't   even think I   don't   like you. But, I'm sure you've quite moved on and this doesn't matter to you any more. However, now you know how I feel and whatever happens is up to you. I don't want you to think I'm all desperate or anything-I'm not. I just want you to know how I feel...so...   -------------------------------------------------------   that's all. should i give it to him or not?! someone, please, help me!

       Well today certainly was an  interesting  day ( not really ).   force-fed primetime previewed nightly/  /why would anybody leave the safety of their homes?   school...i hate it. there are things that i have to face//things i don't want to deal with.      a friend told me today that i still like my ex, to which i sarcastically replied, "oh yes, i do. you just discovered the deepest, darkest secret of my heart."         Sarcasm is the protest of people who are weak.     maybe i do..i don't know. and if i do, what am i supposed to do about it?   after all the bitchy things i've said about the poor boy, how could i ever tell him face to face or on the phone that maybe the feelings i thought i have aren't really the ones i feel at all?   how can i tell him that maybe i started to fall in love when all of a sudden i was shut out?       even if i miraculously managed to tell him all that, would there really be a point?  how do i know he wouldn't just turn around and leave me again? well it   wouldn't really surprise me   if he did that; i deserve nothing more than    rejection.          why can't i just be the person i want to be? why does everything have to hurt so much?
