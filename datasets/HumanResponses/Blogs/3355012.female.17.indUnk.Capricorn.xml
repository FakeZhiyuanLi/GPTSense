      ok....so I went to cuzzos and told her the news...She didn't care...she knows I can make my own decisions...We just agreed that *certain ppl* cant find out about it...atleast not for now...That was yesterday, Wednesday...  Yesterday nite i caught my Z's at Beffers house...They ran away and when i finally found them there i was too tired to drive home...imagine that...Z'd till bout 11am this afternoon and headed home...When i got home I called to check on the movie plans wit the girlies *cuzzos* and found out the stealth got broken into...not memos stealth, but jim's...The expensive ass stereo got stolen, and everything in the car got stolen...So there was no movie money to fulfill those movie plans (by the way Ive been tryin to plan them for days now)...Sometimes I wish I was one of those spoiled kids that have rich family...Then i paste a big red mark on my face letting me know i REALLY hate ppl who baste in their WEALTHINESS...especially when its not them making the money...but their PARENTS...It must be nice...Cuz they definately aren't..And I dont mean all of them, just the ones that woller in it...If I was rich I'd...OK...Lets get the hell out of dreamland!!!  Lata on ill prolly go to T's house...didnt talk to him at all yesterday and feel kinda bad...O well...No big deal..I mean its not like were TOGETHER!! grr....anyways....im gonna go get the hook up right now....more later...peeace pot micro dot

      So...Today I helped get shit ready for cuzzos Birthday party tomorrow...I played a little "hide and seek" with Beth most of the day, and finally met up with her at my house...So me her and Kelsey went to talk to Thomas at the gas station..She SO likes him! hehe Hey, he is a cutie! Anyways...we left when it got busy and rolled over to McDonalds to make complete asses out of ourselves....Bush sucks! RIGHT KELS?! :>) While driving, we saw a man in a truck with a horse trailer and he found it odd that I told him that I liked his horse...Possibly becuz THERE WAS NO HORSE IN IT! haha Nor was there one in the backseat of the red mustang....but he sure looked...Wake the dead?? Hes theyre biggest fan! We dropped Kelsey off at her car, came to my house and watched Steve on WAND, and went BACK to the gas station....now im here ---> HI! ..Welp, I got cuzzos Birthday party tomorrow...Ill prolly have something interesting to say afterwards...Peeace pot micro dot...  PS. I talked to Ashley today...She's at prom as we speak...I miss my best friend!! :(
