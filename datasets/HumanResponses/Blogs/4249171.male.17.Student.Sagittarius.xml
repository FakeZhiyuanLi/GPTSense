       Well, i finally got a 64-CD holder... i had outgrown my 32, I ended up doubling up CD's. Its pretty nice, its made by Napster and has 8 slots on the front for easy access.. its pretty cool. BUT I WANT MY IPOD!!! jeez.. to be able to get ANY song i want at the touch of a finger... man, thats nerd-vana right there. I just spent about 30 minutes loading it up, and found some CD's that had been missing... including some computer games. I'm still missing a couple, but my bet is that abby stole them from me.. she finds ways to get my cds (and clothes...err, she wears my DC Shoes hoodie all the time). I think she has my Yellowcard and Offspring CD. I'm going to look in her room (don't tell her, she hates people going in there) and find all my CD's b4 i go to practice. OH YEAH! crap, i have to practice. I'll update later tonight.      signing off,   DP       until the day i die

       Poker has become a new hobby for me, especially Texas Hold'em. (you may actually find me using poker terms in here.. i'll make sure to clarify what the  deuce  [another name for a "2", also a line from Family Guy] i'm talking about). Anyway, at the PDP retreat, we played a ton of poker. We were up til 2 one morning, and then 5 the next (well, if you lasted and weren't knocked out first). I got no sleep, but it was pretty awesome. I was getting the best hands possible, it was amazing. No four-of-a-kinds though.. but i really didn't need them.       I just realized i sound cocky, but you have to understand something about Texas Hold'em. You can not control the hands you get, therefore, you have no say in the structure of your hand. Getting a decent hand is all luck. TH is all about how you deal with that luck. Even people with bad luck can win some decent money. Its all about the bluff and knowing when to hold them and when to fold them... but  flopping  (the laying down of the first three  community cards  (shared cards, there are eventually 5 of them in a hand)) a full house always helps!      Oh yeah, there is a Texas Hold'em poker game at target (get the tournament one, not the world series one. the latter is really lame) in the actual aisle near the older games. Its 20 bucks, but its really good for a pure poker experience. Its like playing online, the computer is that good. (but they don't go all in on every turn like the idiots online with free money). Or i can just burn you a copy.. but you'll have to win it from me, lol.       Signing Off,   DP       we'll all float on

       well, i figured i'd write one of these nifty blog dealy's for the heck of it. This way i can look back at this at the end of my senior year and have one of two emotions: 1) sadness, or 2) "Man i'm an idiot.. what was i thinking!?". Besides, it seems cool..       Anyway, i figure that senior year has just started for me... i got my senior pictures (i hope they can get rid of zits), tryouts for one last season of CC start tonight (it'll be an awesome season however, you need to come out to see a meet!), and i have homework to do (yeah, I still haven't finished my AP Calc or AP Stats... meh). Oh yeah, and there was that PDP retreat.. but it doesn't count, cuz i want it to start today. If i have it starting last week, then that would just be confusing and wouldn't work out that nicely. Especially since this is a journal of my senior year and i'm starting it today. So there. And if you followed that whole line of thinking, here's a cookie.      Time to rewind now.       Those senior pictures suck. Most of you know that i can't fake a smile or bluff (unless its 2 in the morning.. then i can take you for all you are worth with just 2-7 offsuit, N.K. knows that well...). There are a bunch of pictures where they made me show my teeth... man i hate braces. They made me look really ugly (alright, you have 10 seconds to make all the jokes you can think of...) ANYWAY!! yeah, i hate forcing a smile, it never looks right. My pictures in my track uniform look pretty good though. It looks a whole lot less fake. I'll make sure to get some out, some people actually want a pic of me.. i don't know why... (btw, self-mocking is in this year)     hmm.. this a long entry.. maybe i'll put more stuff in later, like the PDP retreat (i think it stands for People Doing Poker) and CC practice when i get back.       Signing off,   DP     P.S. I just did a  spell check on this... its pretty stupid. "Blog" is incorrectly spelled supposibly... w/e.      is that what you call a getaway?
