      It's Saturday.  I've been kind of sick on and off.  It sucks but I'm sure it could be worse.  I've been making CDs for Ger and writing her a nice long letter.  It's really fun to make mixes for people.  It's tough to decide whether or not to include a playlist because I want her to experience the songs as she goes instead of giving them away up front.  But later, it's nice to know who sings what and the titles and all.  Maybe I'll include a separate paper with the songlists with a note not to read until after listening to all the cds.  Welcome to my internal monologue.  I always feel good after doing laundry.  There's just something wonderful about nice clean sheets.  I even washed my pillow today since I've been sick.  Going to sleep will be a treat tonight!  I have an open game of scrabble sitting on my table.  B and I were in the middle of it Valentine's weekend when we had to leave for the airport.  I like it sitting out because it kind of adds his presence to the place.  Feels like someone else is here.  One of these days he'll walk back in and finish the game.  I was losing pretty bad, so I might have to "lose" the scoresheet. :)  I was so warm today that I was able to keep the window open.  Spring has sprung!

      Ash Wednesday is tomorrow.  I have a couple of Lenten promises, but for now I'll keep them between me and the Big Guy.  I have the best workout clothes.  I should definitely workout more often.  Right now, I'm wearing this babydoll tee that is white with light-blue shoulders and it says Princess 33 across the front.  There are even some sparkles and rhinestones!  It's fabulous.  I wonder how many shirts I have that I've never worn outside of my home.  Must be in the dozens.  I had some great King Salmon tonight.  Probably the best I've ever had.  It was at Cutters downtown.  This nut allergy thing is a real problem, though.  I had to ask 3 times about nuts because I asked about the meal when I ordered it and they said it had no nuts, but it clearly had some nuts on it when it arrived.  The waiter felt bad.  It's a nut-filled world out there...  Just booked my next trip out to see the big B.  Not for 4 weeks though. What's a girl to do??  Rafael's wedding is coming up on May 1st.  I hope I'm invited And Guest.  The whole And Guest thing is interesting.  I mean, I haven't been great about being in touch with Raf, so I'm grateful that he even invited me.  But I'm just not sure I'll know anybody else, so it would be great if B could come.  Either way, I plan on going.  It should be a lot of fun, and I'll probably be skipping P-town reunions this year since it's my 3rd and that's a pretty awkward one.  Time for bed!

      I switched the comments feature because the old one I was using was way too slow. So sorry to the people whose comments got deleted.  Bummer.  This new one seems much much better so I don't plan on getting rid of it for a long time.

      gfyj!  some people make me so mad.  i think communication skills are so important in day to day life.  deborah tannen wrote a few books on this kind of thing.  one especially, "you just don't understand" she talked about at ms about 18 months ago.  at first, i thought it was just more bullshit amongst all the touchy-feely self-help stuff that's out there but i think there is something to all of it.  really, the way you say something can completely affect how it will be received.  i think i will be working on my personal communication skills for the rest of my life.  but it does need to start with good intentions.  so for those people out there reading my shit, my advice is to think about how your communication style affects others.  had a great time in b-town this weekend.  i was totally impressed by mit.  the people were cool and smart.  i saw kevin whom i haven't seen since the summer.  and i got to have lots of quality time with b, whom i am ridiculously in love with.

      I'm in b-town having a good time.  Went to MIT yesterday.  Cool school.  I liked the people.  It's cool how they're SO INTO technology.  They were even raffling off memory chips.  Crazy!  Been going to lots of parties and stuff with b.  Even went to karaoke but I didn't sing.  B did a fun rendition of Glory Days.  It was surprisingly good. :)  Maybe next time I'll do a song, but the idea of it pretty much makes me want to hide in the corner of a dark closet.  Going to see Against the Ropes today.  I LOVE Meg Ryan.  She's awesome.  Gotta go eat a wrap for lunch now.  Such a strange concept, the wrap.

      it's all good ;)  i think i'm going to trim down my life a little.  what am i referring to?  well first of all, i am considering switching to basic cable.  it would save me over $50 a month.  i'm not thinking of anything drastic like getting rid of my cell phone or anything.  that would be awful.  but today i found out that cingular is almost definitely buying out attwireless.  that is a wonderful thing because at&t had the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life.  there are so many mountains in seattle.

      I cannot explain just how amazing last night's chocolate fondue was.  wow.  And a little Merlot to go along with it.  B and I played Scrabble this morning.  He beat me by 89 pts.  We had to cut the game short because we had to leave for the airport.  On Saturday, he only beat me by 1 pt.  What a grueling game!!  B is the best!  I got the coolest valentine...  I might go to the robin tonight again with cj and some of the other work folks.  Need need NEED to start painting again soon.

      Yesterday I didn't have much to say.  I worked all day, then went to the robin with Dan then went home to bed.  Pretty low key.  When I got home and checked my mail, my parents had sent me Hershey's kisses for Valentines Day and a cool little silver heart container thingy.  Very cool.  I have it on my desk at work.  I'm pretty much spoiled.    It's been a great great day.  Blue sky and sun all the way.  I have a lot on my mind and it's all good.  I'm feeling very optimistic.  There's so much I want to say that I feel like I can't because this is public and I didn't make it anonymous.  I guess I'll have to keep my private thoughts somewhere else.

      Today I went to war and won.  I always thought it was a silly term to use for negotiating software changes but it sure felt like war in the room.  Going shopping tonight.  I'm thinking about buying a personal laptop.  This one in particular is one that I like:   urlLink Compaq x1000 Series   The end.

      up very late.  spoke to old roommate today.  i miss the good old days.   discussed bell curves and gay marriages with b tonight.  i didn't realize how naive i was about the laws.  i still am surprised that gay marriages are not recognized yet.  that's just nuts.  going to the elementary school tomorrow.  2 weeks ago i helped a girl read a book about harriet tubman.  i had to define slavery for her.  it's strange to teach someone about slavery.  made me feel a lot of responsibility.  i was honored.  last week i helped a boy read a book based on greek mythology.  i'm impressed with how much this series has improved his knowledge of vocabulary.  i always learn knew things in the second grade.  it makes me appreciate pencils and construction paper and crayons and chapter books.

      welcome to my very first blog entry.  i can't believe that it has taken this long for me to finally start a blog.  there are so many people out there that are dying to find out about my random thoughts.  i'm at work.  might just possibly go work out tonight.  need to get back into painting.  big decisions are coming up in the near future.  it's very exciting.  i've been feeling artistic lately.  first i need everything completely neat and clean.  then i can clear my mind and paint.  b is coming on friday night.  valentine's day should be lots of fun.    i have the coolest rose-colored glasses ever.  b got them for me for christmas.  they're ralph lauren.  there's a beautiful sunset outsite the window today. :-)

      Last night I got home and there was a card waiting for me in my mailbox.  A congratulations card from my mom. :-)  Such timing.  Today I discovered FunHi.  www.funhi.com It's this gangsta dating site.  Pretty funny.  You buy virtual gifts for people.  Someone bought me a g-string!  Of course, it's just a picture of one, but that's the beauty of the business model.  Someone was willing to plop down $0.10 to give me a picture of a g-string.  These guys are making tons of money.

      I have a fun story to share.    Last weekend, I went to Boston to visit my darling B.  He had gotten us tickets to see Blue Man Group.  He has some connections with people who work there, so I had actually gotten to meet one of the Blue Men without makeup on my last visit.  During the show, one of the Blue Men creates a painting by shooting spraypaint out of his chest onto a canvas.  He spins the canvas while he is doing this.  It's quite impressive.  During this part in the show, B leans over to me and tells me that KtG, a friend of ours, has one of those paintings hanging in her bathroom.  I told him that was pretty cool.  Later after the show, B introduced me to his friend Kelly, who works at the theatre.  And guess what Kelly reveals from behind her back?  The painting from the show!!  B had arranged for her to get me the painting.  Isn't that sweet? :-)

      Today I made an astonishing discovery.  My mom is the perfect boyfriend.  Apparantly, my whole life, all of my boyfriends have been in competition with my mother!  Imagine that.  Allow me to explain.  I was thinking about what differentiates a good friend from a boyfriend, and what traits make a  good   boyfriend.  I think it's more than just romance that differentiates a good friend from a boyfriend.  There something more, a sense of unconditional love and loyalty.  I also, quite frankly, have higher expectations for a boyfriend.  That's where my mom comes in.  My mother treats me incredibly well.  When I'm around, she leaves me little notes reminding me that she loves me.  When I'm away, she's always sending cards.  Even if she's really busy, she'll improvise and make a card.  For example, she'll grab a pink sheet of paper and draw a heart on it for Valentine's Day or she'll grab a yellow sheet and draw and egg on it for Easter.  These are by no means wonderful works of art, but they're even better, because they're homemade.  If I'm coming home to visit, she'll get to the airport extra early just to be sure that she'll be standing outside of the gate when I get off the plane.  If something good has happened recently, she'll have a balloon or a sign waiting for me.  Sometimes she'll even bring a whole welcoming committee of my family and cousins.  When I get home, I'll see that she bought my favorite snacks and she cooked my favorite dinner.  I always get plenty of hugs, and when I fly home again, there's always a welcome home email waiting in my inbox from her.  If it's my birthday, she'll get my favorite cake.  If she sees something she thinks I'll like, she'll consider buying it for me.  She knows if I want advice or if I just want her to listen.  She's always willing to drop anything if I need her help.  And if she can't get out of something, she'll find someone else to help me.  Simply put, my mother is amazing.  What I realized today, aside from the fact that I am spoiled, is that these are all the traits I think of when I imagine the person I want to end up with.  It's the little details that make people feel loved.  A note, a flower, or a box of my favorite cookies.  To be honest, my whole family has a lot of these traits.  For example, when I went to visit my sister in DC last year, and I got stuck in Detroit overnight, she had a bag full of goodies waiting for me when I finally got into DC.  I, too, try to send cards, emails, and little care packages to share a smile.  I can tell you that it makes for a very happy family, but I wonder if it is completely spoiled of me to expect or even want to be treated like this.  So take my mom, turn her into a good-looking guy, add some flirting, a sense of humor, and a little romance.  Voila.  Of course I'm exaggerating.  In reality, I already have a pretty incredible boyfriend  who has raised my standards far and above where they ever were before I met him.  But I really am surprised to find out that my relationship with my mother has any part in what I look for in a man.  If my mom read this, I bet she'd laugh and tell me to keep dreaming.

      I just finished watching Everwood.  Each episode has some sort of lesson.  This one was that no matter how old you get, you never stop playing make believe.  It's how people prefer pretending nothing's wrong to facing problems.  I'm sure I do that myself sometimes.

      I had a kind of crappy day today.  It started last night when we didn't get to go to this piano bar that I was looking forward to going too.  Then I drank a little more than I should have, but not enough to forget that I was pretty much on my own at The Ballroom in Fremont.  Not a place where you want to be on your own.  Everyone pretty much coupled off and I tried to be cool about it.  I sort of went into the dance floor and danced by myself a little bit.  But that's kind of depressing. So I got another drink since drinking kind of occupies you for a little, but I knew I had too much so I switched to water.  I was no knowing at all what to do with myself when this guy kind of did the little head tilt towards the dance floor.  He looked harmless enough, so I shrugged and went in to dance.  It's nice to feel wanted.  Coincidentally, his name was Angel.  A little angel being sent to make me feel better.  After a few songs we went our separate ways back out to the bar area, where I was once again all by my lonesome.  I realized I was having negative fun, so I headed for the door.  I was feeling a little bad about not saying goodbye to anyone I came with.  Lucky enough, I passed one of them getting a drink and told him I was on my way out.  He didn't seem to upset about me leaving.  :-)  Anyways, I went home and threw up all my alcohol and went to bed.  I was still really hungover in the morning.  Today I found out that somebody egged my car.  This is the second time in like 3 months.  I wonder if I did something mean to somebody in my apartment building without knowing it.  I hope not.  I'm going to report it to the building manager this time.    Three weeks into my pilates workout program and I seem to have gained an inch on my waist.  I have lost 4 pounds, though.  I'm not sure what's going on.  I think it might be the pizza and chips.   I hope to figure out my life in the next few weeks.  That's a pretty big thing to do.  I think I just need to commit to something and let myself go along for the ride.  I'm seeing B on Friday.  We're going to Blue Man Group.  I'm so psyched!  I'm going to bring my new fancy purse.  --K

      I have the best grandma in the world.  Hands down.  No doubt about it.  I just got off the phone with her and instead of the standard goodbye that most people give, she said "I always love you, Kathleen.  You're so good!"  in her wonderful Irish accent.  I cannot do it justice here, it's something you just have to hear.  I makes me feel like a giddy 3-year-old who is very proud and knows she did something good.  Granny is always making me feel like that.  She has this incredible work ethic, and it's always...cheerful.  Seriously, folks, believe it or not, she could be on her hands and knees scrubbing a floor but if you listen you can hear her humming to herself, and if you look closely, you can see a twinkle in her eye.  When I was a kid throwing a temper tantrum, all Granny would have to do was look at me with that bright laughing smile and wave her finger at me.  That was kind of a private joke between my siblings and Granny.  She wasn't waving her finger in a commanding way - just moving it back and forth.  She insisted that she could make any of us smile with the wave of a finger.  And it was TRUE.  We would test her.  One time, I was doing a really good job, holding out, my face locked in a fake frown.  Then she says with her jovial voice, "Oh, Kathleen, you're so ugly when you frown. "  Well right then and there I broke into laughter.  I mean, who's grandma is going to call them ugly!?  I couldn't believe it.  She was kind of spicy, that grandma.  She put up with a lot too.  One time when she was babysitting for my older sister and I, we decided it would be funny to pee in our beds.  Only I couldn't do it.  I just couldn't go, and it wasn't a moral thing.  So I had to use water instead of pee.  Boy, Granny was angry when we told her we had fallen asleep and both peed in the bed.  The disapproval was overwhelming as we watched her change the sheets for us.  I remember feeling really ashamed, and understanding that it's not funny to make more work for people.  Granny taught me a ton of lessons.  I could write a whole book about it.  Some of my favorites were just those little sayings.  I can't think of any right now.  Most of them had to do with taking it easy, being laid back, keeping a good perspective, and using your head.  Granny is full of wisdom.  I can't write all day, but I think I've made my point.  Granny can always brighten my day.  I have a ton of respect for her.  And I want to be exactly like her when I'm older.

      i want to give a little shout-out to my favorite big sister, am.  she is the schizzle.  she's chillin' out max an' relaxin' all cool in miami.  doing her kung fu and sundry crazy things.  she sings a lot, but hasn't quite got into the rap yet.  t also deserves a mention since he just turned 21 on saturday.  saturday is the perfect day to turn 21 and par-tay.  i won't tell anyone that he fell asleep and pulled a humpty-dumpty.  (didn't wake up till the morning)  g is far far away doing that jesuit thang.  we should all be so generous.

      Yesterday I felt as if I were floating, just kind of an outside observer of the world.  Today was exactly the opposite.  I felt like I was definitely LIVING my life.  I felt like I had a real physical presence in the world.  It's strange how different  people can feel.  I wonder what causes it.  Sometimes I think it's whatever music I'm listening too.  In both cases, I was in the car when I felt these ways.  Today I bought myself 4 pink roses.  They're beautiful.  They almost look like wildflowers, the way they're arranged.  Such simple, elegant beauty to brighten up my day.  I think everyone should buy themself flowers every once in a while.  I love bright, colorful flowers.  That's why it's great that the spring is here.

      drip     drip     drrrrrrrr  ip I have a leaky faucet in my bathroom.  I tried to look up how to fix it on the internet but it seemed way to complicated.  Now I am one with the water.  Sometimes I stick a washcloth at the bottom of the sink to muffle the sound.  But when that becomes saturated with water, then the dripping starts again.  This time it's the water dripping down the drain.  It's amazing how loud dripping water can be.  Maybe an acoustician will explain it to me someday.

      sometimes i wear sexy clothes underneath my work clothes and i secretly dance around inside my head all day.  today i have a lot of energy.  it's great!  i think food greatly affects the amount of energy i have.  i just, for the very first time, tried this baboon-butt orange called a minneola.  it tasted exactly like an orange.  i was glad that it wasn't bad.  i just stood on my hands for a little while and the blood rushed to my head.  brian said that my face was red.  i told him it was a gravity problem.  aarthi didn't get it.  sometimes i feel like i'm the only one in the world and i'm just playing this video game.  sometimes i laugh at the other characters in the game.  mostly because of awkward moments.  like this guy made a funny face at me as i was rounding a corner on my way to get some water.  i had momentum, so i didn't have time to make a face back before he was out of sight.  i just cracked up instead.  i don't even know the guy but i've seen him around at work.  it's bad to think of people as characters, even if i think of myself as just a character in a fun story.  people are people, not objects.  i'm reading a book all about this.  it's making me realize some of the problems i cause for other people.  it's called  urlLink Leadership and Self Deception: Getting Out of the Box .  it's a quick read, and done through stories.  it really changes the way i think about people in both personal and professional relationships.  i'm not sure if it'll stick at all, but i hope so.  i do recommend the book to everybody.  back to work.  back to work.  everybody.  work work work work.  work work.

      I rented "Honey" last week and liked it a lot.  It's about this hot hip-hop dancer that's trying to make a name for herself.  The best part of the DVD was the special feature where you learn a hip-hop dance right in your own home.  (Sorry to all y'all who missed out by seeing it in the theatre!)  For some reason I was pretty giddy this morning and I just broke into the dance in my bedroom, and I totally got it!  It was crazy because I was totally struggling when I was doing it with the dancers on the DVD but I totally got it this morning.  Totally.  I wonder if people will believe that I actually learned a hip-hop dance from the Honey DVD.

      Well the Wurst shirt was a big success for most of the day until I decided to do some shopping.  I'm going to a wedding this weekend (Yay Rafael and Alice!) and I wanted to get a sweater or shawl to wear over my dress in the church.  Anyway, my punk rocker/hippie outfit got quite a few stares at the fancy dress shops in Bellevue Square.  I ended up making a quick wardrobe change while I was in a dressing room.  I switched to just wearing the tank top underneath.  I totally caved in to social pressure, but I don't like to be stared at in that obnoxious way.  It reminds me of this time in 7th grade when I wore purple and white striped jean cutoff shorts with a tanktop that had some flowers in the middle.  Apparantly "Duh! Flowers and stripes SO don't go together."  Had to turn my shirt inside out that day...  Some things never change.  Oh yeah, and Everwood was great tonight.  I think next episode Amy and Ephram are going to kiss.  My favorite character is actually Amy's older brother.  He's the only one that doesn't have any issues and he pretends to be mean, but he's really always doing nice things for everyone.  Got another card from my mom :-)

      Went to see 13 Going on 30 with Karen yesterday.  Cute movie.  She inspired me to get rid of some old stuff.  She has this rule where in order to buy 1 thing, she needs to get rid of 3 things.  I think it was 3.  Might have been 5.  I'm going to stick with 3 for now.  So I just got rid of 24 pieces of clothing and 2 stuffed animals.  Now I want to go shopping!  I also decided to transform some old t-shirts.  Every buy or get a t-shirt that you never wear because it's just too big or too boring?  I took out the scissors and went to town.  I'll probably wear my newly tranformed Wallingford Wurst Festival shirt tomorrow. :)

      Looks like my fellow Tigers are having some trouble over in Old Nass because of Newman's Day.   urlLink Here's the article.   Newman's Day happens every April 24th, and to participate you need to drink 24 beers in 24 hours.  People are encouraged to drink one beer an hour all day.  When I say "encouraged", I mean by peers, not by the administration.  I never really participated since I knew I couldn't handle it, and I actually think it's kind of gross to drink beer at 8 o'clock in the morning.  Despite my lame showing, I always loved Newman's Day because it brought the whole school outside all day.  Lots of people skipped classes and carried couches into the courtyards to sit and drink.  There were plenty of people playing volleyball or having a catch or throwing frisbees and footballs.  It was such a laid back, social atmosphere.  Everyone dressed really badly as if they were up drinking all night.  Lots of flip-flops and your occasional girl in a bikini top.  One year one of the couches caught fire and nobody would claim the burnt couch so it just sat in the courtyard for days.  My most memorable Newman's Day experience was in the Joline courtyard where I lived sophomore year.  I was hanging out enjoying the scene and chatting with my good friend Kate.  She was attempting to do Newman's Day and was well into her 24 beers.  Someone came over and asked her to join a volleyball game, so she asked if I'd hold her beer.  I'm standing around holding her can of beer when one of the rent-a-cops on a bike rides right at me.  I was like "uh-oh" and "shit" so I put the can down on the ground.  But he came up to me anyway.  Everyone in the entire courtyard turned to watch as I stood there mortified and frozen.  He asked to see my PUID, and I reluctantly gave it to him, knowing that it has my birthdate on it.  He asks if I realize that underage drinking is illegal.  I say yes sir.  He asks what I'm doing with the beer.  I can see Kate pretending to look apologetic while cracking up a few feet away.  I tell him it's not what it looks like.  I'm holding it for a friend.  He almost laughs at my lame story and walks me to the bathroom where he watches me pour it out in a sink and recycle it.  He writes my name down.   Kate owes me big time.  Nothing ever came of it.  I wonder if my name is still written down on some list somewhere.   The bad list .  Everyone should be on a bad list every once in a while.  I definitely had some beer after that.  Yay for Newman's Day.

        Meet Megan Greene So far in my life I have known Megan White, Megan Brown, and Megan Greene.  Megan White was really mean and basically tormented me all through middle school.  Megan Brown was in my eating club and now teaches in the Bronx.  Megan Greene was my pseudo-roommate in college and now teaches at a fancy boarding school in the northeast.  Next I plan to meet a Megan Black.  So Megs and I were chatting yesterday about relationships and she made a little analogy that I decided to share (with her permission).  She likened living together to having sex in that there's no going back.  I suppose that's true.  They're very different beasts, and depending on your views on sex, living together can be an even bigger step.  Suddenly there's no going home.  And if you're sharing a bedroom, which you probably are if you're living together, then you just have a lot less personal space.  I'm sure there are wonderful things that go along with it too, aside from the obvious half-price rent and utilities.  Neither Megs nor I are living with our boyfriends.  I'm not looking to move in with B anytime soon.  At this point, I'd just be happy to live in the same state as my boyfriend.

      OH!  Now I get it.  The reason that the Ooh Child song was in my head was that they played it on Everwood last night.  I just read Chris's blog and he quotes the same thing!  Strange coincidence?!

      (Responding to a comment)  I DID watch Everwood last night.  What a great show!  In the midst of so many violent movies and television shows, leave it to the WB to make you smile.  Everwood is one of the less cheesy of the WB shows (7th Heaven would be the most cheesy.)  I say "less" cheesy because it definitely still is cheesy, but it's just REAL too sometimes.  It's real in a way that the Brady's and Cosby's were not.  Everwood does have some great music.  Last night's show was kind of sad, so I bet some of the songs could go into the next great depressing mix cd.  Although you can't force it.  It just has to happen.  Another song I'd suggest is "Time and Time Again" by Counting Crows.  Although the entire album  August and Everything After  could probably beat out any depressing mix cd.  Back to the topic of Everwood, I really hope that Ephram and Amy get together.  I know it's too soon since they're both on the rebound, but I think they'd be great together.  Hopefully it won't take 10 years like it has for Ross and Rachel on Friends!

       Ooh child things are gonna get easier Ooh child things’ll get brighter   That song always makes me smile.  Things are supposed to actually get more difficult as you get older and have more and more responsibility, but the song gives some hope and inspiration.  I'm not going through a particularly hard time right now, but I believe everyone can always use a little extra motivation.  I have swapped CDs with my friend Walter.  We found out that we each had "depressing" mixes.  Basically it's that mix you listen to when you just want to bask in the sadness of the world.  I had one that was made by Chris Sharp.  I believe it was his first mix, and he made me a copy.  It wasn't intended to be depressing as far as I know, but it just sort of turned out that way.  I think it's a fabulous mix.  I've just finished listening to Walter's mix and that one was a big downer too. :-)  Night Swimming was on it, among many other songs.  Counting Crows are always good for depressing songs.  What are your downer songs?

      I don't usually read forwards all the way through, but I got one today that I liked a lot.  It's an article written by this college student, Matt Brochu, at UMass.  He is talking about what it's like to be totally infatuated with a friend of yours.  Back when I was a writer for the Princeton Triangle Club, I wrote a song called "Guys and Girls Can Never Just be Friends."  It was along the same lines, and it was also a bit of a comedy with some truth to it.  But this guy REALLY captures the feelings involved.  It's definitely worth reading.  It brought back all sorts of memories.   urlLink http://www.dailycollegian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/11/21/3fbd76353e7dd   Happy Reading!

      I don't have too much to say today.  Maybe I'll tell a story.  The trampoline incident... Last year, for my birthday, my sister sent me a trampoline.  It was one of the smaller single-person models that you can use inside.  I decided to try it out one night with a workout.  It was a warm evening, and it was starting to get dark.  I had just gotten home from work, and I was in a great mood.  I was definitely ready for some jumping.  So I went to the computer and put on my "Psych Up" playlist nice and loud.  I began to dance around the apartment, threw off my shoes and started jumping away.  Waving my hands in the air, like I just didn't care, if you know what I mean.  I was having a great time but it was getting warm, so I stripped down to my bra and undies.  That was much more comfortable, and more good songs came on.  I continued to jump and sing and dance around getting a great workout.    I was spinning around in circles when I happened to glance outside.  My jaw dropped as my hand went to my mouth.  A small crowd had assembled outside on the sidewalk.  They booked it as soon as they saw me look.  And while cracking up, I ducked as soon as I recovered from my shock.  It was pretty funny.  When I slowly peeked out the window next, I saw that a couple of them had returned, waiting for the next show.  They didn't get another show that evening.  The lesson:  Remember to close the blinds before jumping on a trampoline in your underwear.

      I'm baaaaaack. Easter was a blast.  Sometimes it's just really nice to be home spending time with the family.  We got to talk to Ger in Nepal.  It was a pretty bad connection but at least we could hear her voice.  I found out that the cd mixes I sent her were more popular with her roommates than her.  Kind of funny.  I figured she'd be really into the Shake Ya Body mix with a great assortment of dance music.  She did like the Random Mix for Ger.  And I didn't realize there are people that don't like the Beatles.  Who'd have thought.  Yesterday, I read  The Five People You Meet in Heaven   by Mitch Albom.  I liked it a lot.  It gives a whole new perspective on what heaven might be like.  I never thought of it like that.  Albom is really creative and writes in a very engaging way.  A lot of the scenes were very colorful and resulted in these vivid mental pictures.  I'm officially a fan of this author.  I liked this book even better than  Tuesdays with Morrie .  Although that one was great too.  They both teach you some lessons.  Now I'm reading  Disgrace   by J.M. Coetze.  It's well-written and I'm enjoying it, but the main character is pretty despicable.  It bothers me when the person you're supposed to like is clearly a bad guy.  It's hard to read sometimes, but the writing is so wonderful that I can't stop.

      That Goethe is a smart man.   I'm going to NY today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to spend time with my family.  It'll be good to see my little cousins who aren't so little anymore.  We're doing an egg hunt tomorrow.  And B is coming down tomorrow too.  I got him an Easter card.  Is that strange?  I know he doesn't read this so I don't think I'm giving away any surprises.  B's not really up with the online world.  He's hardly ever on IM.  Quel dommage!  Here's another quote that I like: "Anyone can become angry - that is easy.  But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way - this is not easy." -Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics

      Sometimes it bothers me that I'm just one person.  How am I supposed to get everything done that I want to get done when we only have like 97 years to do it?  It just occurred to me that I might never live in NY again.  And I might never live in California either.  How crazy is that?  I wanted to live in Paris for at least a few months.  Will that ever happen?  And will there be time for me to become a famous painter?    I am contemplating starting a life plan.  There's a lot I want to do, but I'm going to have to prioritize it.  Like in software, you just can't do everything.  I sort of have a checklist in my head.  Teaching elementary school is on it.  And selling a painting.  And writing a book.  And having a baby.  I've always meant to be super fasionable for some stint of my life.  That sure won't happen without a lot of work.  I've got some planning to do.

      Got a haircut yesterday.   urlLink Glamour shots are here.   I like it.  B approves.  Score!  Went out last night with the boys.  As luck would have it, there were some girls too!  For some reason there seems to be a derth of girls in Seattle.  And forget it if you're looking for single girls.  We were trying to think of single girls for this guy that was with us and we came up with a whopping zero people.  It appears to me that lite beer is making a huge comeback.  Almost everyone was drinking it last night and it's been happening more and more.  Maybe it's because the summer is coming and people want to trim down.  Red Orange Yellow Green Sometimes people are really mean.  I couple of people have snapped at me lately.  Maybe I'm sending off some agressive vibe or something.  One of the times I think I asked one too many questions.  The other time, I refused to change my mind or be quiet.    Peeps season is in full swing.  I'm going to an egg hunt on Saturday.

      Hey there.  You're an Allstar.  Get your game on.  Get Paid.  Who doesn't love Smashmouth?  I'm strongly considering registering myself as a Democrat.  I'm currently not affiliated with any party.  But I'm scared of what Bush and his people are doing to the economy.  Sure, working for MS, I get to cash in on some of his big business favoritism, but it's just so wrong.  I saw the WORST MOVIE EVER on Saturday.  It's called Hellboy.  I was convinced by a couple of guys.  I don't know what they were thinking.  Definitely a movie worthy of walking out on.  SO BAD.  And I don't have very high standards.  Think about it.  My favorite movie is The Cutting Edge.  Don't waste your time on this one.  I'd rather go to the dentist.  My BC t-shirt shrunk in the wash.  Bummer.  Who listens to the instructions on the little tag anyway?  Guess I'm going to have to show a little midriff.  Tomorrow I'm transforming myself.  I'm going to see Shaun.  He's amazing.  He works at Vain.  I think we're going to do some red and blonde highlights and some sort of cute cut without going too short.   Does anybody read my blog?  Not too many comments!

      I probably check my blog the most out of anybody, which is strange because I should know if there's a new post or not.  I guess I look to see if anybody added comments.  I don't have a very large readership because I haven't told all that many people.  It's hard to decide who to tell because sometimes I feel like I have to watch what I write depending on who reads this stuff.  I suppose, since this is public, that I should assume everybody is reading it.    I wish my friends had blogs so I could check up on them.  I think I'm getting old.  I went to this birthday dinner last night at a nice restaurant and people in our group were playing with balloons and salt.  This one guy would rub the balloon on his armpit so it had static, then he'd hold it up to a pile of salt.  The salt would jump up to the balloon and make a mess.  I appeared to be the only person put off by the whole incident.  I felt bad for the waiter who was going to have to clean up after us.  And it's just kind of annoying when you have salt flying around the table.  There were lots of penis and vagina jokes too.  I suppose I am getting old, but that's fine with me.

      Well I'm still packing.  Packing for trips always takes me days.  I'm not sure why.  It's like a tragedy or something if I forgot toothpaste, even though I have like 7 opportunities to buy toothpaste before I ever need it anyway.  It's not like I'm going to a third world country.  I think B packs lighter because chances are if he forgot something, I have it.  Like band-aids are on my list.  And 2 separate purses.  Extra batteries for my gameboy advance (fun on the plane).  3 paperbacks.  I've gotten comments on the fact that I even have a list.  It's sorted by clothing, accessories, health&beauty, other stuff.  There's also a list by day of what I plan to where each day down to purse, belt, shoes (need to make sure I pack all the pieces).  And of course there's the list of things to do as I walk out the door: turn off computer, close blinds, drop bills in mailbox, leave rent check written out in apartment in case something happens and I don't make it back to Seattle by June 1st.  I'm really excited for this trip.  There are lots of people that I haven't seen in a year that I'm sure I'll bump into.  And Pat McGee band is playing.  And I'm going to the Triangle show.  I'll have to post some pics when I get back.  But for now, I have to pack!  Only half the items have been checked off the list!

      Ok, so the subject was really going to be "New Purse!" but I didn't want to come across like some kind of valley girl or something.  But I did get the most fabulous orange purse today.  It has these little circles on it!  It'll be perfect for Princeton Reunions.  B seems really stressed out these days.  He has so much work to do.  Hopefully he'll get it done by this weekend so we can have fun together.  Reunions can be a little weird for us as a couple because, although our friends overlap, we also have 2 entirely different sets of friends.  I know his and he knows mine, but our priorities are different for who we want to spend time with.  It's not a problem.  Basically we split up for some of the time.  Even though we don't see each other that much because of long distance, we only see these people like once a year at reunions.  I think it's good for us - it forces more of a healthy balance.  I bet B doesn't even think about it or analyze it or anything.  He's more of a "go with the flow" kind of person.  That makes me the over-analytical one.  Last night I went with Karen to see Urinetown at the Paramount.  I thought it was really good, although it's weird to watch a show about urine.  The puns were hilarious, as one might imagine.  My favorite was Freedom/FreeTum song when they wanted to have free toilet access.  Karen and I had Mexican food beforehand and we couldn't decide what makes a Mexican restaurant authentic.  I think it needs to be a little grungy.  Like Gorditos!  This entry is getting too long to the point that people won't read it.  Right, because I have such a large readership...  I'm late for Kells.  It's Chris Dickens' birthday!  I gotta represent.

      Ah, wine.  Glorious wine.  There's nothing like a glass of red wine in the evening to help you unwind.  I have never been more aware of my toes.  Ever since this pedicure, I'm a little paranoid about getting the polish chipped.  I didn't realize just how often I bang my toes into things.  Books on the floor, the car door, my subwoofer,...I had no idea.

      Yesterday I went on a mini-shopping spree.  I needed to make sure I had the latest in orange clothing.  You see, next weekend is Princeton reunions, and each year you need to look better and better.  The catch is that you need to look good while wearing orange and black.  I have a few outfits that should do just fine.  I even bought some orange flip-flips with heels.  Those were a mistake.  Who would buy flipflops with heels?  Ummm...me.  I don't recomment them.  But they were on sale!    Anyway, when I was trying on a blue/green skirt at Urban Outfitters, I was trying to move quickly, and I accidentally zippered my skin.  Ah!  That hasn't happened since I was a toddler and wore those one-piece pajamas with the feet.  Anyway, the big question was how to get free.  Do I painfully unzip?  I sort of tried but it was hurting and then somehow it just freed itself.  The morale: take your time in the dressing room!  Today I had my very first pedicure.  Can you believe I'm almost 25 and never got a pedicure?  Well I guess that's just the kind of person I am.  It always seemed like a waste of money.  Until today.  It was worth every penny of the $15 it cost.  And such a good color!  A nice dark red.  Overall, I'm very happy, and I think I'll be a returning customer to this place in Kirkland.  I never really liked my toes until today.  Now they're so fun!  They totally massage your feet and calves with lotion, so it was very lucky that I had shaved my legs this morning.  After the pedicure, I went down to the Kirkland waterfront to read and show off my toes.  It was overall a lazy, but good day.  Now I gotta grab dinner and get to Sopranos.  It's the second to last episode of the season!

      What exactly is the allure of thin ice?  Why do people walk head-on into bad situations?  Why do people go looking for trouble?  I do it myself, and I think it's about the excitement of the unknown.  Testing your own limits and taking risks.  We learn at a young age that it feels kind of good to do what you're not supposed to do.  It's the adrenaline associated with it.  That's why the kids who had tons of restrictions do a lot of sneaking around and go crazy in college, while the kids who were given a lot of freedom don't seem interested in breaking the rules.  Like if I were to say, whatever you do, don't go to  urlLink www.zefrank.com , how many of you would go there just because I said not to?

      Last night I went bowling with a group of Microsoft people.  It was all guys until Nick's girlfriend showed up.  Where are all the women in Seattle?  I'm not what you call a natural bowler.  I certainly wasn't born to bowl.  There was only one round out of three where I wasn't in last place.  But who's counting?  CJ is in a league, which is kind of funny because the only people I know who participate in bowling leagues are Fred Flintstone, Al Bundy and Dan Conner from Roseanne.  Even ignoring the fact that none of those people actually exist outside of fiction, CJ doesn't exactly fit in with that crowd.  So I have to assume there's something about bowling that I just don't get.  Anyway, CJ taught me how to bowl.  I didn't even know there was a right way to bowl.  I mean all you do is roll a big heavy ball into some pins.  Anyway, it was pretty fun.  And definitely a cheap way to spend a Saturday night.  My beer was only $2.75.  After bowling we went to this karaoke place across the street called The Rickshaw.  It turned out to be a Chinese Restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese Restaurants because I really don't like the smell of the food.  So I wasn't very upset when we couldn't find good seats and had to leave.    Then on to the Lava Lounge in Belltown.  I sat between CJ and Jay Fleugal.  I don't know if I spelled his last name right, but he's a nice guy.  I wonder why I've never met him before.  He likes to call Shotgun before we're in sight of the car.  CJ and I had a strange conversation about two totally separate things which left us each thinking about our own issues.  I think that's what happened anyway.  Jason was there too.  He told me he always has an internal party going on.  I think he should show it more!  Giorgi was really intense about bowling, and at Lava Lounge he started to literally play with fire.  Nick was kind of preoccupied with his girlfriend.  And I'm not sure what Paul was thinking about on the other side of the table.  We stayed until they kicked us out around 2am.  Then we went to Nick and Paul's place.  I wanted to go to Giorgi's place to say hi to Walter but CJ and Jason wouldn't allow it.  They thought he might be already in bed.  So at Paul's place we played with the XBOX karaoke game.  It was actually pretty fun.  Singing badly in a group isn't so bad.  Then CJ drove me home at 4am.  Jay got Shotgun.  I slept in today.

      Elementary School!  Today I got to read to the second grade.  I read a chapter from BFG by Roald Dahl.  This is exactly kind of thing really makes me want to be a teacher.  It was so much fun, the story was good, and the kids clapped at the end of the chapter.  They all said Ew! and Yuck! at a part when something was "as red as blood."  It was great!  I got a new look from blogger.  What do you think?  I switched comments to use the ones that come with blogger, so I no longer publish the old ones, but I might find a way to get them back.

      Ooh.  Blogger changed their look and feel.  I like blogger especially these days since they gave me a gmail account.  GMail is great.  The biggest thing it's lacking is some sort of IMAP or POP service so I can use it with Outlook or Outlook Express.  United recently announced that they're bringing back the ice cream sundae to their Premier First Class service.  I wonder if they read my blog...  Had a good time at the W Saturday night.  Yanda came back to visit.  He thinks I should go to Prague with B.  I think that's a great idea.  Karen was wearing some great heels, and she introduced me to her friend, Mark, who has horrible taste in cocktails.  I took some pics but I can't get them off my camera phone.  Sopranos night was uneventful.  I brought cupcakes with the rainbow chip frosting.  That stuff should be regulated.  You should have seen the Pfau sisters devour the frosting off their cupcakes!  It's so good.  I prefer yellow cake with white icing.  None of that lemon stuff though.  Best way to ruin a cupcake.    Bought tickets for Nepal this morning for Tommy and me.  I used my magic to get us some sweet seats.  I can't wait.  Only 7 1/2 months.   Seven and a half cents, doesn't mean a helluva lot Seven and a half cents, doesn't mean a thing But give it to me every hour Forty hours every week That's enough for me to be  Living like a king!  --The Pajama Game

      It's been a while.  I've been so busy with work and I also went to St. Louis this past weekend.  B & I had a lot of fun.  We saw the Gateway to the West.  It's a giant arch.  I said it reminded me of McDonald's.  B thinks that says something about me.  I think it says something about society.  We did lots of fun dancing at the wedding.  I tried out some superhigh heels, but ended up changing to lower ones due to the extreme pain I was in after walking like half a mile from the church back to the hotel.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to uncomfortable shoes.  I got upgraded to first class on all my flights (4 total since I didn't have any directs.)  I love first class, although Northwest is NOTHING compared to Continental.  Continental's First Class is better than United's too.  Continental is so awesome!  They are so polite and kind, and they serve ice cream with your choice of toppings.  I always get caramel.  It's so good.  Their food is best too.  My big takeaway from the flight was that First Class is dominated by middle-aged white men.  I was the only woman up there on one flight, and on the bigger plane, there were 3 women out of 24 total.  All the rest were middle-aged white guys.  Nice men for sure, but I was glad to represent.  Sometimes I feel guilty getting one of those huge seats when there are way bigger people squishing into tiny seats in the back.  But that ice cream...!  B and I did lots of dancing at the wedding.  I think I already said that.  He looked great in his Armani suit.  It was cool because we didn't really know anyone, so I had him all to myself.  Of course it had it's drawbacks too because we were sitting with a table of strangers, but they went to Princeton, so we had stuff to talk about.    I really enjoy weddings, noticing all the details.  My favorite detail about this wedding was the bouquets, especially the bride's.  It was a whole bunch of pink roses, tightly closed, all poking out in a perfect half-sphere.  Gorgeous!  The ceremony itself was a little awkward because it was in a Catholic church and you could tell that most of the people had never been in a church before.  Nobody sang along with the canter or said the responses or anything.  Well B and I did a little but it was all kind of strange.  They caught on to the shaking hands thing but the people in front of us didn't realize they were supposed to turn around so B & I kind of got gypped.  But on such a happy occasion one can overlook such things.  :-)

      I have so many piles of paper in my apartment that have been accumulating the past few weeks.  Half the time I haven't been home, and when I am home, it's only for a few minutes.  Today my goal is to organize it all.  If anyone has a system that works, please let me know.  Mail, magazines, written notes, receipts, paid bills, waiting-to-be-paid bills, letters.  I did cancel my New York Times subscription because that was just mean to all the trees.  I couldn't keep up with reading all of it.  Anyway, today is paper organization day.  The BoF students are returning home today.  I've added my friend Gaby, from Argentina to my Friends list on the right.  There you can see a picture of the group on a boat cruise and at an elementary school.

      I have been spending the week with a group of 15 students from around the world gathered together to discuss the future of work.  They range in age from 19 to 24 and they are from the following countries: Kenya, Turkey, India, Italy, South Africa, Slovenia, Canada, Australia, US, New Zealand, Norway, Argentina, UK, and Japan.  They were recruited from an organization called TakingItGlobal ( urlLink www.takingitglobal.org ) and I have been completely wowed.  I am so grateful to have participated in discussions with this group.  Listening intently, I have learned so much about what is going on outside of the US, what people care about, what people need, and our global challenges moving forward.  I'm inspired to become more internationally involved myself.  As a relatively rich American, I feel somewhat guilty for my lack of global involvement, but I also feel empowered.  We are so lucky that we have the freedom to voice our opinions and our access to influential people.  I'm looking forward to the last two days of the week.  I've already learned so much, yet there are still plenty of issues to discuss.

      I'm having fun in Boston.  Lots of hard work done this weekend in my apartment hunt.  I think I found one.  Who wants to be my roommate?  I've only been able to get internet access for like 2 minutes at a time.  Might be a problem with the wireless network or something.  I've been craving internet access all weekend.  I had no idea how much I relied on it.  At least my phone works.  That would be tragic.  Got to see Alexandra and Mike for too short of a time.  They're still the same fun people that they've always been.  We're going to have lots of fun in the fall.  I think B and I are going to Walden Pond today then back to Seattle tonight.    Don't forget to call your dad for Father's Day.

      Last night Scott Eblen invited me to an exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum: Van Gogh to Mondrian.  He's a huge Mondrian fan.  I'm a huge Van Gogh fan.  The paintings were great.  I love Van Gogh's color choices, and his brush strokes really help create a mood.  There was a really sad painting of a man with his face in his hands.  It's cool to go to a museum with someone who actually knows how to look at art academically.  He's taken a bunch of art history classes.  Apparantly ART101 has an entire lecture on Mondrian.  I think I may have slept through that one.  (I PDFed the class.)  Anyway, I'm totally inspired to start drawing again.  It's been a while since I've been doing any serious painting, so I think I need to draw first and slowly get back on the horse.  Tonight I have to start the packing process for a trip to Boston on Thursday.  I haven't even started my lists yet.  Lots to do!  If a girl "swoons" what is the male equivalent?  Drools?  Feel free to write in suggestions.

      With all my babble about wrecked feet, I completely forgot to write about the best part of Friday night.  Walter and I went to see the Broadway musical  Movin' Out  at the Paramount.  It was amazing!!  Exactly my kind of show.  Music by Billy Joel (they play lots of his greatest hits) and Choreography by Twyla Tharp.  The dancers are amazing and it tells a good story too.  There's this great scene where a girl in a red dress gets proposed to.  It's cool to see that done through dance.  There's another really cool dance where a couple is having a fight and they are kind of pushing each other around while still dancing.  A few times the guy lifts the girl and looks like he's going to drop her.  It does a fabulous job of getting across the emotional struggle between them.  The *lights* were amazing too.  I think my best part of the whole show was the very beginning.  The music, and lighting were perfect.  It left you with this exhilaration for the rest of the first act.  I LOVED it and if anyone has tickets and wants to see it again before it leaves Seattle on the 20th, I'm in.  urlLink www.movinoutonbroadway.com

      I was consolidating files from old floppy disks onto my hard drive when I came across a document from my cheerleading days.  Take a look at a whole bunch of my old cheers.  I'll show you the moves if you ask nicely (and if I can remember).  I apologize in advance for the use of the term "Injun." as it was written before political correctness.  These days, even use of the term "Indian" is controversial.  I have the utmost respect for Native Americans.   urlLink Valley Cottage Indians Cheerbook

      Why don't guys understand that girls' dress shoes are not conducive to distance walking?  It's such a simple concept.  They should teach guys this in middle school.  It's just polite.  If there is one or more woman in the group and you're out at night or at some event that's not super-casual, ask before taking a long walk.  This has happened to me a few times, and I'm sure it's not because the guys in the group are mean.  I think they truly don't get it.  I've been told to "toughen up" and "it's not much longer."  Well F*CK YOU!  If someone was in pain, I would recommend sympathy and/or encouragement.  Or FIND A CAB!  So as I woke up this morning and felt the pain of my feet before touching them down to the carpet, I was angry.  I had been waved off when I asked for a cab.  I was told it's ridiculous - it's only 4 more blocks.  I'm not kidding, it was like 14 more blocks from that point.  My shoes are actually very comfortable for going out.  They're just not made for long walks.  I had the appropriate band-aids on my pinky toes for an evening out.  I don't want to have to wear tennis shoes when I go out, and I don't want to change my friends.  I don't like to be the demanding, needy girl in a whole group of comfy-shoe claden guys.  Next time I hope whoever I'm with will be more sensitive, more aware, and polite.  In reality, I will probably have to shout a little louder.

      They often have alcohol at morale events at work.  I just had 2 beers right in the middle of the day.  It reminds me of college.  Ah, those were the days.  Today was a very good day.  It started out with a mysterious 1:1 I had with my manager.  He said we were going somewhere but wouldn't say where.  Turns out we went for a ride in his 1958 Mercedes 190SL to go pick up a basketball.  Then we came back to my building and shot around on the court outside.  What a fun meeting!  And we did do some talking, so there was some business aspect to it.  Sort of.  I'm pretty lucky.  I'm sure this isn't the norm for most workers of America.  Yesterday I had a bad experience.  I took this all-day class called Strategic Planning.  I learned a lot, and I'm glad I went, but there were these two guys in my group that were over-the-top argumentative.  They are the epitamy(sp?) of someone you do not want to work with.  By the lunchtime, one person left our group.  Before another hour went by, another guy walked away in disgust.  I would have left the table too, but I was hoping to make the situation better and finish off the class.  After having them talk  at  each other for 10 minutes or so and ignore suggestions from the other 3 of us, I suggested they couple off and work separately.  That helped a little.  They didn't couple off but they quieted down a little.  People like that don't realize how unproductive their discussions are.  Why repeat the same thing 50 times.  We heard you and we wrote it down.  Let's move on.

      Great day at the elementary school today.  Almost makes me want to quit my job and become a teacher...  Some students were behind in typing up their biographies, so I helped out.  Compared to the average second grader, I type at lightning speed!  As I was leaving, a small, blonde, freckled girl complimented me on my little pink purse.  There's nothing like a trip to the second grade to give you a little confidence boost.  The girls give me lots of compliments on my clothing and accessories.  Some people even ask where I got certain things.  I try and return the favors.  One time I noticed that a girl got her ears pierced and she was so excited.  The teacher hadn't even noticed.  At school today, I also got to hear a little more of the BFG story.  The parts I've heard are all broken up but I think it has something to do with storing dreams in jars.  Some of my dreams I certainly wouldn't want to put in a jar and keep forever.  I think I'd rather keep real-life moments.  I'm going to see Harry Potter 3 tonight with Jason.  It was sold out when I tried to see it with Chris Dicken's Movie Nights.  I actually know  the  Chris Dickens, so you'd think I would have been able to get in, but I didn't try that hard.

      Everybody has secrets.  Deep dark secrets.   Some people tell everyone their secrets, so they're not even secrets anymore.   Some people announce that they have a giant secret and make you guess.   Some people tell you they have a secret, and they tell you who knows their secret, but they won't tell you the actual secret.   Some people tell you you're the only one that knows their secret then you find out that all your friends already know. Some people pretend they have a secret just to get on your nerves. Some people never talk about their secrets.   Some people don't even know they have secrets. I don't have any secrets that would ruin me if they got out.  I don't think. I won't usually tell a secret of mine unless I'm prepared to deal with the consequences. Most secrets are only really important to the beholder.  I told a secret today and I feel great about doing it.  I've gotten lots of responses about the  urlLink reunions pics .  Lots of people think they look funny.  One person said: "I couldn't tell if that was me or some spastic man-beast that barely grasps the english language."  I'll let the readers decide who it was.  I've also gotten "There's one where I look pretty weird!" and "I've always looked like a strange dancer."  This is what strange dancer says about man-beast: "He does kind of look like an odd creature."  My favorite comment:  "Ooh-  I love the photos! And such a cute one of you with the purse/ben with the shoes! What a dynamic duo - so Batman and Catwoman, so Lucy and Ricky, so Kermie and Piggy (okay, I'll stop)." Notice the "Ooh."  I've been told that I overuse the term "ooh" in my blog.  I'm not sure that's possible.  Now's the paragraph when I share some deep revelation I had today.  It's a secret.  If you close your eyes, I'll whisper it in your ear...

       Mood : tired  urlLink Reunions pics below...  I just got home from Soprano's night at Dan's place.  For those of you not in the know, tonight was the season finale.  I think Tony Soprano is softening up in his old age.  Kind of like Bill Gates did when he had kids.  Either way, the show is still good.  I like the way they show the human side of everyone.  A lot of that stuff actually seems realistic.  At least realistic enough for me.  I saw Mean Girls yesterday, and I thought it was really funny.  Some of it reminded me of the kind of stuff I'd pull in middle school.  In particular, we did a lot of the three-way calls where the third person didn't know that someone else was listening.  We did it mostly to guys.  I remember asking a guy "Do you think Amanda is pretty?" while she was listening to every word.  Luckily, the guy said "I guess so."  We'd also fake "beeps" (call waiting) a lot when we wanted to politely get off the phone.  I had brunch with CJ today at the Jitterbug Cafe in Wallingford.  We talked about life plans, specifically how much separation we'd want between work and life.  I don't want work to be the reason I get up in the morning.  CJ wants his job to be such that it is intermingled with his everyday life.  I think it really depends on what kind of job you have.    To bed, I said!

       Mood : Chipper  Had a dream last night where M&Ms melted in my hand.  Then a guy named Ed ate them anyway.  I love driving across the bridge around 8:45 am when you can watch the endless string of UPS trucks on their way into the city to deliver all the people's packages.  Today's a skirt day but I didn't think it was worth it to waste a skirt when I'm in a class from 9-5.

       Mood : Anxious I decided that I want to live with some roommates in the fall, so I posted my name on this list.  I was contacted by these girls that are looking for a third roommate.  They said something like "You said you like to socialize and are easy to get along with, and that's what were looking for."  It made me realize how silly and generic my profile sounded.  Well I suppose it worked.  I scheduled a time and went to meet the girls and see the apartment.  It's a really nice place.  I was totally nervous to meet them.  I'm not sure why.  It felt like Tower bicker all over again.  Make a good impression in only a few minutes so that you can be one of the chosen ones.  But you also want to be yourself so that it actually is a good match.  If you're going to be a psycho roommate, I'd say you should just lay your cards down up front.  Anyway, I think it went well.  They were friendly and it seemed like a good match to me.  I needed a big hug after it since the whole meeting had been kind of stressful.  Maybe it's because girls are harder to impress than boys.  I'm a little nervous to find out if they picked me.  B said that I shouldn't take it as a negative mark on me if they don't want to live with me.  He says not every item on the grocery store belongs on every shelf.  He's a good boyfriend.

       Music : Garth Brooks  Mood : Happy  I have so much to say about the past few days.  I'm going to hold off on talking about reunions until later tonight when I can post my pictures.    B and I went to see Oklahoma! on Monday and I loved it.  My favorite song is the subject of this blog entry.  Maybe I'll buy a shirt that says "I'm just a girl who can't say no."  Such a happy musical!  I'm a big fan of those super happy shows.  I don't like shows with sad endings.  That's why I like the WB and chick flicks.  The set of Oklahoma! was really cool.  It was on a rotating stage with lots of other pieces that rotated.  Sometimes I miss building sets for theater.  My favorite musical is A Chorus Line. I think it's because it's about dancing!  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  When we were just sitting in our seats waiting for the show to begin, this woman sat down next to me and she had the most horrible really strong perfume.  It was HORRIBLE.  That's one of my biggest pet peeves. It's SO RUDE to wear so much perfume when you're going to be in an enclosed space with other people that can't move to different seats.  B was more forgiving of this woman, but he didn't have to sit next to her.  He said that she probably didn't realize she had too much perfume on.  I said I thought her husband should tell her these things, and he didn't agree.  I hope when I have a husband he'll let me know if I'm stinking up the place.

Here's&nbsp;Karen and me&nbsp;in our fun skirts:  &nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink More Pics    Saturday night I saw iRobot with CJ, Chris, Jason, Walter, & Julie.&nbsp; I didn't go out afterwards because I wanted to get up early and do errands.&nbsp; Didn't exactly work out for me.&nbsp; I woke up at 1pm.&nbsp; My timing is really strange.   Sunday night I went to an AWESOME CONCERT with Chris.&nbsp; We saw Barenaked Ladies and Alanis Morissette.&nbsp; I got a sticker that says "I love the Ladies".&nbsp; I would have gotten a shirt but they were $30 and I'm trying to cut back.&nbsp; Only bought 2 purses this weekend.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; FTR, they were both on sale.&nbsp; Anyway, the concert was SO COOL.&nbsp; Chris is a member of the BNL fan club so we were literally in the 7th row right in front of the stage.&nbsp; I could see the color of Ed's beautiful eyes.&nbsp; I was mainly going to hear BNL, but it turned out that Alanis put on a fabulous show.&nbsp; It was inspiring in a girl power sort of way.&nbsp; I'm going to buy one of her CDs.&nbsp; Well I would if I hadn't cut myself off from shopping.   Today I did 500 million errands, but I still have many to go.&nbsp; B is at the beach with his family.&nbsp; I'm kind of bummed I didn't get to go this year, but there's too much going on in Seattle with my move.&nbsp; Plus I want to spend as much time here as I can.&nbsp; I'm getting kind of sad about leaving, especially all the fun people.&nbsp; I don't even want to think about it.

      Dude.&nbsp; Hip-hop dance is so much fun!&nbsp; Karen invited me to go to hip-hop class with her and Matt (who happens to be one of the guys who bought&nbsp;us hot dogs last weekend).&nbsp; I didn't know what to expect and when I walked in there was a big group of people doing this complicated but really cool dance.&nbsp; I was like, woah, I've got some catching up to do!&nbsp; Then I saw all these other people waiting on the side and realized that our class hadn't started.&nbsp; Turns out that was Hip Hop 4 and we're in Hip Hop 1.&nbsp; It actually wasn't very hard to pick up at all.&nbsp; I would even think about trying Hip Hop 2 except for one thing.&nbsp; In the warm up, you have to dance across the room "freestyle."&nbsp; I suppose I'm freestyle-challenged (read: I look like a freakin' idiot).&nbsp; Luckily, most people had similar issues, so I think I sort of blended in, but that was the hardest part.&nbsp; The fact that you have to be travelling across the floor while hip-hop dancing was just not natural for me.&nbsp; Once we got to the actual dance, it was much easier.&nbsp; Matt and Karen did a good job and we all had the dance figured out.&nbsp; I'm definitely glad I went!

      I was sick all day.  I think it was the kamikaze double that did me in.  Dan said he thought they were quadruples.  He's always buying rounds for large groups of people.  I tried to escape but he caught me and gave me one.  Karen and I arrived in style to the new Seasound Lounge.  The layered fluffy skirts were a big hit.  We ended up at the Down Under and danced a little bit.  I met two guys named Beau and Fritz.  I was sure their names were fake.  I met them when I went to the bar to buy a drink.  I put my fake Coach purse up on the bar and they both seemed to look at it and then made some comments.  It sounded like they were talking about real vs. fake and some sort of rating.  And then I saw them look at a few other girls.  I asked if they were rating people's purses and they were like no...boobs!  Then one of them said it was ok because they were married.  I asked if they were from San Francisco but they didn't get it, so I explained that's where gay marriages happen.  They were like OH NO!  Not to each other!!  I finally got my drink and told them I hope they find what they're looking for.  Caroline wanted to meet them so I did an intro then went back to the group.  Later they walked by and sort of looked at Karen so I introduced them and Beau said he knew her.  She didn't recognize him but then she figured it out.  Turns out he works on Windows Messenger.  Small world.   I let Sharalee's friends pick out my shoes, so I ended up with silver sparkly ones.  At the end of the night my feet were in pain.  Karen's were too.  (Is that grammatically correct?)  So we waited on some big rock while the guys bought us hot dogs.  Pretty cool.  I never did pay them back.  Karen runs with very nice gentlemen.  I assumed they were with her. :-)  While we waited for the hotdogs, a random Mexican serenaded us.   urlLink Click here to see the pics .

      I consider myself an early adopter.&nbsp; That, coupled with the fact that I can be really stupid sometimes, made me decide to try out "bladeless shaving."&nbsp; I've seen it on commercials a lot lately.&nbsp; It's this shaving gel called  urlLink Veet , and you use a razor-shaped piece of plastic that has no blade.&nbsp; It cost less than $10 so I figured, why not.&nbsp; I find shaving to be really annoying, so maybe this would be better.  &nbsp;  Well, first I check the ingredients and #2 is urea.&nbsp; Yuck!&nbsp; Whose?!&nbsp; I read the precautions and it says " Failure to follow use directions and precautions may result in chemical burns. "&nbsp; Ok...but now I paid money for this stuff so I decide to trudge on.&nbsp; It says to do it inside an empty tub to avoid spillage on carpet or clothing.&nbsp; Geez.&nbsp; You're supposed to try a patch out and wait 24 hours to make sure you don't have any allergic reactions, but who wants to wait that long?&nbsp; So I spread the gel as evenly as possible on both legs.&nbsp; It says to wash hands immediately afterwards.&nbsp; I'm a little freaked out as it is, and my hands are starting to tingle so I don't really get as much gel on as I wanted, but I move to the handwashing phase.&nbsp; Now you leave it on for 3 minutes.&nbsp; But how much time did I spend washing my hands?&nbsp; I decide to wait 2 minutes 30 seconds.&nbsp; Then you're supposed to try a spot and see if the hair removes.&nbsp; I try and no dice.&nbsp; Then I realize, I did the other leg first, so I try that, and it works.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; I work on that leg and realize it's taking me a long time.&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; It says all over the bottle  DO NOT EXCEED 8 MINUTES .&nbsp; Now I'm frantically fake-shaving this gel off.&nbsp; I miss lots of spots.&nbsp; Hair is sort of coming off.&nbsp; Time is ticking away.&nbsp; My legs feel kind of weird and I decide to bail out and turn on the shower.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to rinse off.&nbsp; There's still a film on my legs.&nbsp; I try soap.&nbsp; More soap.&nbsp; Eventually I just dried them.&nbsp; Now I'm not  allowed to swim, sunbathe, or use astringent lotion for 24 hours .&nbsp; This is INSANE.&nbsp; I'm supposed to wear a short skirt tonight.&nbsp; Ack! &nbsp; I'm going to have to put the Veet away with the other nightmare products such as Instead.&nbsp; They should really put a message on the label that says " Not for paranoid people. "

      I've been really bad about writing.&nbsp; I wonder if anyone reads this anymore.&nbsp; I feel kind of guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write but life has been totally full these days.&nbsp; I haven't had time to go to movies or take fun trips.&nbsp; I have weird sleeping patterns.&nbsp; I think my brain is tired from tracking all the stuff to do for my move.&nbsp; It's a big change.&nbsp; New apartment, new city, new career, new income level, new roommate, new life.&nbsp; It's a little stressful.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I found a new roommate.&nbsp; Her name is Michelle Pilat from Wisconsin.&nbsp; I googled her but nothing much came up that&nbsp;seemed to fit her phone personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems really cool.&nbsp; After  urlLink Karen's horror stories about past roommates ,&nbsp;I was picturing awful things, but I'm thinking this is a really good match.  &nbsp;  I got a book from my friend, Hunter Allen, in the mail today called "Seedfolk".&nbsp; It's a cute little story.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said it&nbsp;made him think of me for some reason.&nbsp; And inside the book has this printed sticker that says "One Book, One Community" and something about passing it on.&nbsp; I wonder who I'll give it to, and whether Hunter expected me to pass it on.  &nbsp;  I got an iPod yesterday.&nbsp; It's an older model and I got it for free from a friend in Canada.&nbsp; I felt so stupid and was sure it was broken because I couldn't get it to charge up or turn on.&nbsp; Turns out you have to hold down MENU and PLAY to turn it on.&nbsp; And people&nbsp;say Apple has great UI...&nbsp; I definitely could have used a START button.&nbsp;

      You know you're getting old when you go to the ice cream man and put the ice cream in the freezer until after you eat lunch.  I remember when the ice cream man used to come down our street.  It took some skill to actually be able to get ice cream.  The guy was really fast.  Basically, as soon as we heard the bell-like music, one of us would book out the door to stop the guy.  Another would run upstairs to beg for money off my mom.  Another would slowly walk towards the ice cream man stalling while the upstairs negotiation took place.  It took at least 3 people.  I liked to be the one who ran out and stopped the guy because then you have the longest time to pick out what you want, but my siblings and I took turns.  It was the worst when my mom said no and we had to let the ice cream man drive away leaving us empty handed.  Sometimes we had some backup change just in case.  At middle school, the ice cream man would be waiting behind the big row of buses when school got out.  He was there every day in the springtime.  Unfortunately, the buses never waited long enough for you to get ice cream.  If you wanted to make your bus without ice cream you probably had to have your bag packed before your 8th period class.  If you needed to go to your locker, you pretty much had to flat-out sprint to make the bus.  I was lucky enough to be friends with Eddie Anderson.  Eddie was the best.  He didn't have an 8th period class, or maybe he had gym.  Either way, he had time to go to the ice cream man.  So every morning, I'd give him my money and tell him what I wanted.  Did I tell you how awesome this was?!  Eddie was totally cute, by the way.  If I only had like 40 cents, he'd tell me what I could get with that amount of money.  Usually, I'd give him 35 cents to get a cherry Italian ice.  Every once in a while, I'd do the run for us.  What an amazing time that was!  Ah...the ice cream man.

      Ever feel like a stranger in your own world?  Half the day is over and I have had no human interaction.  I walked down the street, went to the bank, used an ATM.  I came to work, went to lunch, looked around and realized I knew nobody.  Sat by myself in a vast expanse of table eating my white rice quietly.  I imagine I looked pensive as I contemplated the strangeness of it all.  Where was everybody?  Is there some secret party I wasn't invited to?  I'm not feeling bad about it - I'm just fascinated.  How does such a thing come to be.  It's an exercise in probability.  I imagine this will happen a lot once I move to Boston.  I didn't expect it to happen before I left.

      I feel really bad that I haven't had time to blog lately.  My life is this giant whirlwind.  Two weeks just went by and I barely noticed.  I only have six weeks left in Seattle.  Moving is a lot more complicated than I expected.  I have to deal with packing, movers, getting my car moved, changing car insurance, registration, and my license, lots of dr/dentist/etc appointments while I still have good health insurance, financial aid, loans, leases, finding a roommate, figuring out my classes, finding a part-time job, transitioning out of Microsoft, selling stock options, buying cheap software while I still can, cancelling my phone, electric, signing up for new cable, and so much more.  I feel like I'm going to explode with details.  How do normal people get all of this done?  I'm plagued by my attention to detail.  I'm taking a mini-vacation this weekend for 4th of July.  B will be here in less than 4 hours.  We're spending a few days in Seattle, hanging out with friends downtown tomorrow night, then off to Portland to meet B's extended family on Sunday/Monday.  It should be great.  Trinity got her oil changed today, so she's all ready for her trip to Portland.  They tried to trick me into paying an additional $240 at the Infiniti dealership today for a Power Steering Flush and an Ignitian Flush but I didn't fall for it.  Well, I cheated and called my dad who said it was completely unnecessary.  So they put this black mark on my record at the dealership.  In all caps on my bill it says how they recommended these services and I DECLINED.  That's right I did.  They even told me that they put it in the computer.  Ever since they swindled me for an engine flush at 15,000 miles I've learned to never trust them.  I'm not scared of their black marks.  I certainly won't miss that dealership.  Hopefully the one on Comm Ave in Boston is better.  Somehow I think it will be even more expensive.  I need new running shoes.  Ones with red trim.  Maybe I'll check out the sales this weekend when B and I go downtown to see the new library.  It's a very impressive structure.  I bet B will be thinking about the acoustics.  It is made of glass so maybe it will be echo-y.  B did this whole study on the acoustics of libaries, so this is kind of his specialty.  He even lectured about it to the Acoustical Society of America.  Pretty rad in a geeky kind of way.  Whatever.  I work for Microsoft and swear by my Tivo.  My friend Carrie once told me I should embrace my inner geek.  I just can't do it.  I like to think I could be that girl walking down the street.

      I just sent out my Microsoft goodbye mail.  So freaky.  This is really happening.  Moving to Boston.  Aah!  So many goodbye meals these days.  I could really use a hello lunch or something.  If you read my blog you can come to my goodbye party.  It's Friday the 13th starting out at Chopstix.  Wear some flair.

      If you know what an LDR is, I feel bad for you, because it probably means you're part of the club.  There's a feeling of solidarity among members since nobody wants to be in the club.  A: How's the LDR? B: It sucks.  How's yours? A: Actually, she's coming this weekend. B: Lucky you!  How long has it been? A: Almost six weeks. :-( B: Bummer.  How are things going? A: Not great.  We almost broke up last week.  I don't know how much longer I can do this. B: Can't she get a job out here? A: Nah.  They don't have a good Ph.D. program in ___ out here. Blah blah blah  LDRs are such a strange thing.  They're certainly a downer when it comes to conversation.  Week 5 is always the worst.  I'm not sure why but it's so impossible to go for 5 weeks without seeing someone you love.  You kind of lead 2 lives - one in your head (and sometimes on the phone) where you're together, and the other one is your real life.  Neither is complete - both have something missing.  It's like you have this incomplete existence, never quite satisfied.  When you do see each other it's artificial because someone is visiting, so you're together at all times and you can't really see what their life is like since you're affecting it.  Everything is planned.  You can't just be like "Hey what's up?  Want to come over and hang out?"  Well you can, but the other person always says, sorry I can't really catch a flight right now.  When your upset and in need of sympathy, the cellphone-photo combo isn't exactly good for cuddling.  As I see it, there is one major advantage of the LDR.  The surprise visit.  I often encourage other members of the club to try it out.  It takes some planning and a few white lies, but it's totally worth it to see someone's expression when you wake them up in the morning with a kiss.  There can definitely be some confusion involved.  Often I find myself fantasizing about surprise visits.  I walk around a corner and there he is, B, with his great big smile.  Lots of hallucinations.  It's good for the imagination.  My long distance relationship has lasted what seems like forever.  It's kind of amazing that it lasted so long.  At times it's gotten really frustrating, but obviously it (he) is worth the wait.  The really amazing thing is that I'm finally going to lose the LD part of the LDR in 9 days.  I can't even imagine it.  I'll be out of the club.  Ben's picking me up at the airport.  It still doesn't seem real to me.   Of course  I'll miss all the fine gentlemen of Seattle.  Maybe B will buy me a hotdog on a streetcorner in downtown Boston...  And Karen, who will I go shopping with?  Who will wear fun skirts with me?  Maybe you should come to Boston.  S won't mind.  LDRs aren't so bad...

      I had my second to last trip to Sea-tac Airport today, as I dropped my Aunt Helen off this morning.  She was wonderful enough to come for a few days to help me pack.  It was a grueling weekend, but fun too.  We learned that packing is a lot more fun with music.  Now I have 35 boxes all packed and ready to go.  Just a few more left.  A few things didn't make the cut, so I've been giving away lots of stuff.  Plants went to Jason.  Booze went to Dan.  The hoola-hoop went to Sharalee.  Some big t-shirts went to Ciesel, the homeless guy in front of my QFC.  He was hoping for men's jeans, but I couldn't really hook him up.  I have a big bucket of gesso, if anybody out there paints - I'll give it to you for free!  I bet most people don't know was gesso is - it's this white acrylic thick paint that you use as a basecoat for oil paints.  I love it!  It's thick and goopy.  I always wanted to stick my whole hand in the bucket but never actually have.

      Back on May 18th I pseudo-suggested that people take a look at zefrank.com. Somehow in the time between now and then I ended up meeting Ze. He's my first web celebrity friend. Fun stuff. He was working with my group for a little bit, so we took him out for a little goodbye evening when he had to go back to Brooklyn.  The first big thing Ze ever said to me was "You don't move your arms when you walk." So we already started off on the wrong foot. It's not true actually. I do usually move my arms, but at the time I was playing with the cuffs of my shirt and in order to reach them I had to straighten my arms. Whatever. I'm not defensive about it. Then he made fun of something I said in a meeting at work in front of a bunch of other people, and I was like geez, is this guy  ever  nice to people? Such a smartass! It happened one more time, then eventually, after like 6 weeks I tried talking to him again and it turns out he's a pretty nice guy. He's just kind of intense and likes to pick on people for the sake of humor. I'm usually ok with people making fun of me in a friend situation, but maybe because I was seriously trying to learn from him and have real discussions, so I just wanted to be taken seriously. In the end I did end up learning a whole bunch. I feel like after the past 3 years I know so so so much about social computing. It's a fascinating field. I hope I can do more with it even though I'm leaving work.  Here's Ze.  He's my buddy now:  urlLink     urlLink More Pics from Ze's last night.

      Ever find yourself shaking your booty in the kitchen at work?  It probably means you shouldn't be reaching for another coke.  Today was a high coke day.  Usually I only have one and that's probably one to many, but I'm having a splurge day today (3).  I heard Kirsty Allie had 14 sodas a day at one point, so at least I'm not that bad but I don't want to look like her either.  And I'm probably burning some of it off with all my booty-shaking in the kitchen.  Lots of energy today.  It's getting really close to the time when I leave Seattle.  14 days left.  That's pretty freaky.  I think the worst part is going to be all the goodbyes.  I HATE saying goodbye to people.  It's like the worst thing ever.  So if you're reading this and you're going to be saying goodbye to me, I think you should just skip it or at least keep it short.  Maybe a good luck and a hug.  Don't be insulted if I'm kind of standoffish during a goodbye.  It probably means I'm trying not to get sad.  It's kind of an emotional time and I'm a pretty dramatic person.  I hope my goodbye party doesn't end up with a whole bunch of sad awful goodbyes because I'll probably be drunk and it's harder for me to mentally remove myself from the situation when I'm drunk.  Maybe I'll just slip out right before the goodbyes start.  I guess that would be kind of rude.  Maybe I can just refuse the goodbyes.  I'll just be like - oh I have a few more days, I'm sure I'll see you again.  Later!
