      i'm moving to the "room" downstairs pretty soon....almost done w/ painting it.  i decided w/ a purplish-pink color wall..(totally girlie!) white ceiling, and pale lavender trims.  now the problem is...painting the uh...ya noe..where the wall and ceiling meets.  so when i first painted the ceiling white, a bit of the top part of the wall got white on it.  then i'm just like "screw it"..i'll fix it with the purple-pink paint...  guess what?  got some of the wall paint on the ceiling.  i can't use masking tape cuz when i tested it, some paint came off.  but good thing eric gave me a good idea..he told me to just cover those corner w/ thin cardboard and paint over it...duh...why didn't i think of dat... anyways...dats it for now...chai cien!

      the funniest thing happened yesterday...my lil sis and i went to popeye's to get some chicken strip cuz we were hungry from painting my "new room".  i drove up to the speaker box and ordered...pull up to the window getting ready to pay.  the lady ask me, "what kinda sauce would you like?"  as i was thinking...she continued and say, "we only have mustard sauce."  i told her that was fine.  as she was getting our stuff...my sis and i looked at each other trying to hold our laughter in.  we're thinkin' to ourselves, "why is she asking what type of sauce we want if they only have one?"  LOL  anyways...i guess you gotta be there to get it.  my room is almost done...gee my sis sure gets a good workout from painting the room.  she painted the ceiling and almost all the walls while i painted the corners... ;D     today we're gonna do a second coating and put the new lights on..so far so good.  i love doing projects like this.  btw..did i mention that the room is ~ 16'x 12'?  think requires about two and a half gallon of paint, with the second coating of course.  i guess this is all for now...aloha!
