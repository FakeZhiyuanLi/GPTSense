      g'day to all. how's it hanging? :) I am feeling fairly happy today. especially since people are leaving for a walk. I am not going to go with them because I am tired. even though I went to bed a 10 last night, he he he. well...Illenips I dont think you should quit soccer altogether. just tell them how mad you are at them. or go find that other team that you couldve joined. but dont quit soccer just becasue some people are stupid ass's. well. I hope all goes well. goddess bless

      I was so close to losing the computer. it was  scary. and all because it wasn't working for some odd reason. and it was making me mad. we played tackle speedball today. and it was raining and I got REALLY disgustingly dirty :) it was fun. then I had soccer practice which was boring as hell because the coach isnt strict and doesnt reinforce his "teaching." there was this one girl who was REALLY pissing me off cause she wasnt being serious and wasnt trying and making a fool of herself and it made me want to walk over there and slap her pretty little face a good one. she was making me really mad. and then she started making fun of my friend. she does it everytime. and everytime I tell her to stop it and yet she does it anyways. one of these days I am just gonna deck her....*deep breath*....calming myself down is proving to be very hard. I have gotten myself all riled up. ugh....anyways...why Illenips where you thinking at dear lovely grams house? I like elvish names, I dont like it when Into that thing brings dead mice into the house, it is disgusting. I opened his mouth with my hands while he had one and one of its legs popped out and I almost started to cry, it was so horrible. it is the little things that make me cry...while pretty much all animal//hurt//dead things make me want to cry...anyways....I am going to go Gaia :)

      I love that band, it is awesome. they are so real and stuff. *sigh* I Have nothing to talk about again, well nothing people want to read.  I think I will post the lyrics to Dismantle Me by The Distillers:  I fancy you  But I've been destitute  And all I know dissolved  I could never reundo you  I will always say tis so  I will always speak the truth  Descend into a noose  Could never reundo you  I want to bury you   Vultures circle around  Feathers float, wings flap, beats pound  And though my hearts exposed  I could never reundo you  I will always bled the truth  I will always speak  And know I was sent to cut you lose  I will never reundo you   It's warm and humid on Swanson Street  And the air is filled with electricity  And the sky is deeper than a dream  And the sky is deeper than a dream  Dismantle Me  Dismantle Me  Dismantle Me  And the sky is deeper than a dream  And the sky is deeper than a dream.

       gaaah!!  I am really  obsessed  with gaia. I spend at least a hour on that site at a time!! it is a  good  thing  no one is here  or else  I would be  in trouble for being on the  computer  for so much. I have a really nice pair of  boots  on that site.  mhmm... I really do  love  it there. :) lol yes I  am pathetic  but I have  already stated  that many many times.   la la la  la la la la. I  should probably  go clean my room...or do my homework ...argh... I really dont want to.  lol it is funny . the only time I really do clean  my room  properly is when I am  mad.  Then I  vent  all my  anger  on the  messiness  of my room and make it  all sparkle  like.  *grin*.  yuck! I havent  cleaned  the stuff off of the  ear I  pierced   myself for  two days or something  and I am doing that right now and it is  all scabby  and  crusty.. ugh. I am all  alone  on the computer.. how come  no  one is ever online ??? wait...I signed out  didn't I ...lol. I am an idiot...well .....I  dont have anything to  say again...

      I went riding this morning. The horse that I ride, kyak, wasnt feeling very co-operative today. he didnt listen to anything I said. it was very frustrating. So now my knees are killing me. both of them, I cant even bend my knees. I hate these weak knees of mine. I wish they were stronger so I could do all the things I want to. Like cross my knees, so I can sit down comfortably..oh well......thats all I have to say...I think I am going to go onto Gaia now.

      holy cow that was tiring. my feet ache. walking around the mall for three hours with no good reason is fun though. I want to do it more often. :) even though I feel like my legs are going to fall off. ah...I went to the mall with a soaking good charlotte shirt. I just grabbed it out of the washer put it on and off I went. ah..the good times on the bus..lol. well.....I have nothing to say.

       I feel so shallow. Everybody around me makes things seem so deep, so important. I feel like someone who is swimming on the surface. Everything I say seems to be so artificial. Hypocrite is what I would use to describe myself right now. I am so against artificialness and yet thats how I am...I am so fake. it is like I am hiding and putting on a suit, a suit that is not my own. Eventually this lonely mood will pass, and I will be happy or be comforted. or maybe I will just be content. I will just be content with my suit of plastic.

      I dont know why I have been getting so tired lately....I have been going to bed before nine for a very long time now,  [ about three days ]  and I dont wake up that early.  [ 6:00 a.m. ]  I almost fell asleep while I was reading. And it is only  around 7:30!! thats  insane.  I locked my friends in their lockers today. It was...interesting to say the least. lol. we are whacks. but thats ok cause we like whacks don't we?  yes yes we do. Curly's yet to get back to me on what she wants to be called. I have nicknames for everbody. it is a good way to keep you  anonymity . :) thats a big word...I like big words. it is too bad I can't remember the two big words i learned today...I liked those big words. *..will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive....* is blog even a real word? I like the word: foudroyant. it means "faster than lightning." yay for the lightning!!

      You know sometimes being a vegeterian can be very diffucult. but thats alright. ugh..there was a bald crow in our garbage can...it made me want to cry//vomit.then the  stupid ass  thing had to go and poke it with a straw. you know some people make me want to shoot myself. dammit. how come whenever I get home I start being mad, I dont think thats how it is supposed to be. *big heartfelt sigh* ...and I was doing so well.  right now my most favorite song is " the fuck off song " by Reel Big Fish. it suits me right now.  it is cold in here. I wish I knew how to start the fire. properly. I love fire. It is so warm. goddess. I have homework. Socials. oh well at least I dont have french anymore. I dont have anything against french but our teacher sucked. how can you describe someone thats indescribable?...If I could describe Illenips it woud be: mybeautifulfrenchtwin [yes that  IS  one word] one of these days I should be a lawyer, if someone says something that isn't true I will always say "yes you did " or "yup" followed by " I can prove it ." I need to get myself an interesting life. I am cold. brrr. YAY. the fire is being started!!! now I wont have to be cold. well I could always go get meself a sweater...naw too lazy...yes I am being very lazy today.I have a V on my forehead. i wish I was an animal. an animal that walks on four legs and has fur...I have always wanted to be a tiger. Tiger's are one of my favorite animals. they are so sleek. I just love them. mmmm. my house is starting to smell like cookies...which is rather strange since he is cooking sausages ...*shudder*  la la la la la la la la la.  AAHHHHH  here comes Into!!!he is nice and warm. and soft. and on my lap..and too big to be on my lap..aww he wouldnt get off my lap...it was annoying.

      I wish I could watch the sunrise. I do get up early enough. gaah. oh well. I think I will try to do that tomorrow. and I will wish for people to be better. I love Nirvana and Incubus. I do hate homework though, but I guess that's what you get for missing school. yuck. remind me to never dissect anything that was living again. it was disgusting. I hate eyeballs. I really really do. ho hum...nothing exciting happens in my life. it is all sad or boring. I wish I was going to Maple Ridge. I love Mest also. I hate running without a reason. lol Into [my puppy dawg] is playing with a giant orange easter egg...he is soo cute...even though he is big, and smells bad. just like formaldehyde....*shudder* gaar...I like to growl. I hate socials.  I am going to walk down to the beach today and watch the sunset. I thi nkI will try to do that, I will make it my daily activity, maybe it will give me some peace....

I hate confining feelings and places. people also. they disturb me and hurt me...   Goddess Bless.

I want to type 1000 words but I am not sure if I can do that without driving meself insane, not that would be hard...well I guess I shouldve said without driving meself sane. cause I am not sane I am insane. like alot of my brothers friends. they scare me. I am afraid of little children. well not really afraid I just dont like them. because I am not a nice  person. :) I had  someone tell me that yesterday. I took it as a compliment...well I did after I thought about it and decided I dont like being really nice. yes. yes yes yes. *nods head agreeably.*  spelling does not come easily to my fingers. nope they dont like spelling rightly or even having  good grammer for that matter of fact. lol one day a long time ago [not reallly that long ago.]  I was  talking to a friend and I said something about something and then I said and that is a fatter of mact! and then I tried to correct myself but I said and that is a mact of the fatter. and she laughed at me, and I clamped my hand over my mouth and growled at her. it was...interesting. lol you know what is  fun to do when people are typing?? press the  ... button. :) cause then it  looks like t...h.i....s... only it is difficult  to do it by yourself..it doesnt work to well.  yays for pointless blabbering and licorice. I am a licorice fanAtic. yay for fanatics :) yay for INU Yasha. I had to tape the last episode cause  the  'rents were watching something...I havent  watched it yet..I am too lazy even though I love the show to bits. I am leaning in my chair and my back hurts, :) yes yes it does. but I can handle the pain for I am wonder woman!! *flexes nonexistent muscles.*     wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  I like balloons :) and cake and licorice and chocolate easter eggs. wow that was almost  SIX  full lines of wheeeeee do the pumpernickle for random bolding!!! *does pumpernickle.* you know sometimes I wish I had a life...then I stop and think why? I dont need a life? I am perfectly insane without one thank you very much :) if I got a life I might....*shudder*.....become....*violent shaking* dare I say it?..... HUMAN?!!!... THAT would be  TERRIBLE!!!  sometimes I wish I were a vampire..or an elf...cause then I wouldnt be a homespun. cause being one of those is  baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad....hey maybe I could be a sheep :) lol. ole ole ole. weeee alll smmmeeellllll liiitttllleeee pppiiiggggiiiiieeeeeessss lol someone who didnt  know me might be disturbed by my oddity.....:) I think I made another word....but then that might already be a real word. I am a duck hear me quack. *quackquack*  BE RIGHT BACK!!!...........................................................alright I am back. :) dont worry I just wanted to flop around the house llike a rabid worm..oh god...maybe I should stop acting like an idiot. lol it is true I do actually have to  ACT  to be an idiot :) lol not it isnt true i really am an idiot. I have to  'act'  to be a smart being. I have 567 words, well not anymore....i have more now but anyways I dont think I am going to  go up to 1000 I think I will go up to 600, because it will be alot easier :) I am thinking this is the most I have ever typed for nonsense, you know who is a really good nonsense  typer??  ARRIE-CAY!!  yes she is. she is brilliant. well she is when she isnt cutting herself with can openers :) anyways...lets see how many words there is.... 653 !!! wow ok I am done....:) goodday all :)   Goddess Bless.

I do. he should die or retire. hopefully die. I'm not a very nice person sometimes..:) I dont like being overly nice. in fact half the time I dont like being nice. lol nice reminds me of rice. :) I am an odd...well I dont know how to finish that so I wont.. wheeeeee.....I want a non hurting throat. gaaah......I also want to stay home and sleep...that would be pleasant. *nods* anyways I have to go. bye.

      I am startingt o dislike soccer and sicknesses   VERY   much. Gaia is being an ass so I am going to go read or sleep or something..I want to have another bath but I had one yesterday and the day before and we have limited hot water :| anyways...today was hell because I felt like someone had been beating on me with sticks..and my head and stomach hurt because I am getting sick all over again. I hate Mr. Spratt. I dont know what species he is but I hope there arent any more like it. he always yells and makes us watch boring quiz taking movies. I want to shoot him with a gun full of sporks. *nod*...*I wish my cohorts werent so dumb, I'm not the dumb one, you're no fun..*  I love Lock, Shock and Barrel. and The Nightmare Before Christmas....and Inu Yasha. *more nodding.* A.F.I. I like them too. I have a gash on my hand and I dont know where it came from 0_o  but I do tend to do that alot...we had an assembly today for this group called Determine your Destiny, and it was really good. I enjoyed it. they beat up garbage cans and each other. they also broke bricks with their arms and one guy popped a hot water bottle, which is supposed to take 120 pounds of pressure to pop..which is as much as a school bus tire. another thing they did which looked like it hurt alot was knock this guy off of his stool and then proceed to wrap him up in chains. it looked painful and nothing about it was fake except the punching. goddess my brother is whining again. I hate it when he whines. he sounds like a tire getting the air let out. very annoying....headache...Silverchair is playing right now. the song is Pure Massacre. it is very good. being sick and then playing soccer isnt good, because you feel really worn after. I just got a sudden pain in my leg and it is painful. it hurts quite a bit..oh well. they ran through boards at the assembly, and we got to yell alot. it was fun. lots of people were crying...I dont know why but there was something different about this assembly. it wasnt like all the others that we've had....it was good, and powerful. oh another thing they did was rip a 1000 page phone book in half. we played floor hockey in fit and rec today and I whacked 2 people with my hockey stick..of course it was an accident... :) it really was. wow I have typed alot...more than I ever have before I think....but I think now I am either going to try Gaia again or go sleep....I like to sleep...and eat....and play soccer....anyways ciao for now.   Goddess Bless.

I am so tired of getting yelled at for telling the truth and trying to help. so I am just going to stop. I dont know how long I will be able to but we'll see. aahh....garr...sometimes it makes me so mad. we are killing the earth and each other, this world is being controlled by money and power hungry bastards that make me want to stab my self with rusty spoons. argh....GAAAR!! i desperatly need a punching bag.

      Oh goddess I am so in awe of that woman. seriously. I just finished the series 'Queens own' and now I am totally stunned. I really dont think I have read such a powerful series in a long time. Garth Nix's Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were good but Queens Own was better. I didnt know it was possible to write a book that well. .....oh my goddess.....I love her books. I would die with joy if I had them all, although that would be pointless seeing as how I wouldnt be able to read them...*sigh*....well.....I am just going to sit here in awe...bye...  Goddess Bless.

      I am feeling very gibberish today.I like being gibbersih cause thn no one can understand me. which is how I prefer to be, uncomprehensilble that is. you can so many things about so many people and no one gets it!!! yes. krrys goes home today. oh well. my braclet is digging into my wrist..it isnt very pleasent. it is only digging into my wrist because I broke it accidently and then I melted it back together, but instead of melting nicely back together it had to go get this big ole pointy lump!!! :) thats ok though....AAHHHH!!! school *shudder* is coming up soon :( thats really horrible. gaar....I HATE school!!...*uncontrolable shudders* I am going to go now....I scared myself....

      Gaia is down. until 6:30 am tomorrow.*sigh* oh well this means that when I come home from nanimo tomorrow I will have a nice lovely refreshed Gaia to go to...well I hope :) it is pretty sad that my blog basically revolves around gaia...well actually you know what I did for a while when gaia was making me mad?? I read my mangas!!! I havent done that in ages! I have about 25 or so on my favorites and I caught up on about 4 of them...not very many I know...but I think I am going to get rid of some of them because I never read them..and yet I am very hesitant about that because I love them all.he he he. I am not the only gaia obsessed people. half of my friends are too and they are also flipping out:) I am so glad that they are suffering as well *evil grin* lo lI am so mean :) la la la alala la la. I love that I can blog instead of Gaia. and that I can read instead, you knw that is basically what my life is...school, eating, sleeping, gaia, reading and music. those are all I do. I really dont have much of a life. but thats ok. when I do go out it is normally more enjoyable....normally.....anyways...my dog is insane. he likes to attack my hair...it hurts my  head when it is in a bun and he grabs it in his mouth and starts pulling. goddess let me tell you that it is veruy painful. *violent nodding* well anyways......... I am going to go read. good night all.  Fay.

      I really really do. I have had this goddamn headache for about a week now and it isnt going away, I am coughing alot and my nose is running like a faucet. And to top it all of Gaia isnt working. but I got new clothes. so it is ok. :) me and krys helped mom out with the free store at the church and we picked out some clothes that we like. anyways....I have the most boring life right now. well...no I really do. I had alot of fun on Gaia though last night. I talk about Gaia far too much. It is like my obsession. ......Bija tea is really good. It helps with the sickness thing. it helps bring the constant headache to a really low throbbing. But I bet by now I would be able to handle a full blown out headache. a headache mind you not a migraine cause I really cant deal with the ones I get...................................................................................yes..I have offically run out of things to type. it is st. Patricks day today. I am actually wearing some green! this is the first time in years I have aactually remembered..well actually it wasnt me that remembered it was my mom and she told us. I have my neon green socks and my green earrings and I drew a vine along my hand in green. so I am all set. *nods*  yes  Iam aware that I am rambling on about nothing but I think I am actually quite good at it :)..oh I got these boots at the free store that are insane! they go up half of the calf and have these really skinny heels. and the toe is pointed..oh and they are black of course. The book i am reading right now is really good!! I really love it. I am on the second book in the series and am enjoying it very muchly. lol no I dont think muchly is a word. but it my little world it is. *more agreeable nodding* i like making up my own words, I am very bad at speaking fast without totally messing up all of my words. most of my friends understand what I am saying..although it is the same when I type but luckily they understand that too. :) anyways...I am going to go try gaia again.

      I am really bored. wow how fascinating, I cant even spell that...*sigh* we got a digital camera. unfortunately Jim is going to take forever to learn how to use it so I wont get a chance to take any pictures with it..oh well. i am glad we finally got one though cause now it means I can take pictures of my friends and myself and send them to family and friends who live far away...just in case they forget who I am:) ouch...my wrist hurts. it must be because I am not used to typing. I havent done much typing lately. just alot of reading...anyways....I dont know...you know being sick can be extremely annoying. I have had a headache since last week and now my throat is going all screwed. hmm....The series Queen's Own is really good. It is by Mercedes Lackey. She is one of my favorite fantasy writers, her and Tamora Pierce. I also really like Garth Nix. Stephen King and Christopher Pike are my favorite horror writers, although I havent been actually scared of their books yet. I dont really get scared by books, although there is this one book that I didnt like and made me all jumpy...I think it was called Deathbringer and it was a big book. 500 pages I think and all fairly small print. it was hell to read. gaahh....we went shopping today [we meaning cousin and I]  all I bought was  eyeliner. which I am in need of seeing as how mine got ran over by a car. Grama and grampa left yesterday...they took Kate with them. she is totally adorable, and she has that puppy smell. which was at times very overpowering. I made myself sicker by getting a large creme egg mcflury. goddess was that ever a bad idea. krys gave me this really kick ass earring that I love. it is helping the infection go away. it also might be going away because of the polysporin...I like polysporin..and hydrogen proxide. oh!! Anne mcaffery. she is a great writer too. I love her stuff. goddess thered are so many great authors that i cant even remember all the ones that I like! Not suprising though seeingas how I always forget that kind of stuff. I always leave someone or thing out of a list...always.well I think I have babbled on enough so I am going to go...gaia that is. :)

      Gaia is being an ass again. I hate this. I really really do. there is so much that I hate but I am not going to get into that. I should probably be in bed, but my neck hurts like a bitch in heat. horrible I know. My ear is screwed. gaia is screwed...well for the time being. it tends to go all bad when I am on it. It doesnt help that I am still fighting off whatever I am getting. gaah....head trauma. I probably have that. my head is very fucked.  I need to sharpen my knife. it is really dull...and I dont really use it for that much. just the odd thing or two. this has taken me a really long time to type. lol. it normally doesnt take this long to type so much. I keep getting kick off the computer. *sigh* I like to whine. *nods agreeably* I should probably just go to sleep now. I really probably should. I havent showered today. I feel gross. lol krys is "sleeping"  in a asquat position with her head on the back of the chair. she looks funny. :) we both smell like smoke. but thats what we get for playing with the fire. lol now she looks like a squirreal. she stuffed half of a marsh mallow in her cheek, but thats just like her. sooo soooooorrrreeeee....it is going to be really warm in the camper. lol. it is really a scamper. I like scamper better than camper. mhmmm yup I do. I hope the fuse in the scamper isnt blown..oh well it just means no light...well enough babbiling cause I am outta here. good night all.

PATIENCE!!! what the hell is that?!! growl.  you know how last night there was that whole hockey thing?? well I have a "friend"  who finds that extremely funny!! argh. I blocked her. yes yes I did. call me overly sensitive but the guy broke the other guys spine!!!! he isnt paralyzed but he could very well have been. seriously you dont just smash someones head into the ice. that is soooooo idiotic and...argh....ok I am going...I have gotten myself all riled up...

      gaia isnt working!!!!! aaaaahhhh. oh well I will just go do something else. I never do anything other than that anymore. I think I will try to type a nice big long blog a rooney. ugh..time for money talk :( I hate being told al this nonsense about all this money that I have but dint get to use!!! it makes me so mad!!! well not mad really...just bored and frustrated. anywho....the stupid lady wasnt at school today so I couldnt buy my sweat pants. now that is something that makes me mad. so do people who act like your friend until another person comes around and then they ignore you. that makes me mad. it makes me so mad that I end up just ignoring everybody. I just feel unneeded. no one talks to me or anything. I dont blame them....mom just gave me this purple high heel ornament thats cool. I like it. I am rearranging my room. but I need the vacum cleaner cause I cleaned out under my bed and it is all disgusting and such. I wish gaia was working. then I wouldnt be so bored. not that I am not bored even while I am on gaia. bah ha ha ha ha ha. yes that was a random outburst of insanity. but who doesnt have those?? I am going to post the lyrics for Bandaid covers the bullet hole by Scarling. thanks to curly who introduced me to the awesome band. even though I only know one of their songs...well here they be.   Bees in the caramel and I'm not afraid Surgeons make incisions  what a mess they've made Tearing at my skin leaving knives in my brain Stabbing at the voices making me insane Girls vomit candy and lies that they're fed Boys whisper lullabies and wet their beds Eat TV violence on the toast that they spread Talking with their mouths full here is what they've said  Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again.... Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again... Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole  LA LA LA -LA LA LA LA LA LA-   Spiders in my hair and guns on my mind Thinking about the people who've been so unkind If looks could kill them  I might make myself blind Startled at the reasons that I just can't find Kids break the dishes they crash on the floor Parents hate the noise and shove them out the door Robots steal emotions hide them under their beds It's gets them so excited  Here is what they've said......  Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again.... Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again... Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole  The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole LA LA LA -LA LA LA LA LA LA- BLAH -BLAH- BLAH -BLAH BLAH BLAH-BLAH-BLAHHHHHH   there is also one by jack off jill but it is a little different.

      soccer is my favorite sport in the whole world. well other than riding but I dont do that competivily. yesterday we had a soccer game against the best team in junior high. it was really hard and aggressive. we lost 0-4. pretty sad eh? but our team tried so hard and I personally think it was our best played game. but now I am so sore and feeling so lazy....oh well I am going to go gaia again.

      I know I havent been doing this alot, and it is all gaia's fault. but right now I feel so sick. you know that really I-am-going-to-vomit feeling you get in your stomach?? well I have that in my head. It hurts so much, and I have a punding headache to go on top of it. I really dont want to go to school tomorrow even though we havea  soccer game. we have had 2 practices and two games. it is really pathetic. I am so sick and tired of being sick and tired. no matter how much I sleep I dont feel rested and it is beginning to get on my nerves. I wish I had a magic wand that I could wave and **poof** all better. goddess I would be constantly using that. I wish I was an animal. preferibly a tiger. or any of those big cats. I lost my knife and I cant find it. it is making me mad, and  i really dont like not having it. my ear is getting infected again. damn. my knees are screwed. and to top it all off my room is really messy because I moved my bed. sometime this week I think I should fix it. my bed has been in the same place for such along time that it is driving me mad...argh. ...stupid headache. it is stopping my reading. because it makes my eyes hurt alot so I cant see very well. I love to read and I dont know what I will do if I cant read. mom didnt tape Inu Yasha for me when I went to Marie's b-day party. i am mad. I am mad quite alot today. but I dont mind although sometimes it can be quite tiring.....maybe thats why I am always tired....oh well.  ihave to remember to drink more water. I realize that I drink mybe two bottles a day. and I dont mean the big bottles. well I have typed quite a bit after not typing for a while, I think I am going to go gaia.

      I was reading this girls blog, and I read this and really it made me think of me.    "...Everyone is alone. Everyone is always alone. Even if you don't feel alone, you are. No one will ever know all of the things you think about, not even if you tell them, they won't know everything. We all get born alone and we all die alone. "   but really no matter how you look at it, it stays the same because in reality it is true. you  cant get around it and you cant beat it. there isnt a way. and if there is and you find it could you please tell me?

      ugh last night I felt so incredibly horibble..I had a fever and I couldnt eat cause I felt like throwing up. I hate that feeling. I really really do. I'd rather just throw up and gfet it over with then sit there for hours wanting to throw up...ugh...I feel a little better right now but thats because I had a shower. 15 minutes of a shower in fact, I do think that is a record time for me. I am never allowed to be in that long but no one is going to be home for the rest of the day so... :) anyways....gah..I have nothing else to say. oh well.. g'day.   Goddess Bless.

      I am starting to really like them alot. her is one of their songs:  Like a Stone.   On a cold wet  afternoon  no room for love and emptiness  by a freeway  i confess i was lost in the pages  of a book  full of death  reading how we'll die alone  and if a god will lay to rest  anywhere we want to go  in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  like a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone   and on my death bed  i will prey  to the gods and the angels  like a pagan  to anyone who will take me to heaven  to a place  i would recall  i was there so long ago  the sky was bruised  the world was black  and there you led me on   in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  liek a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone   in all i read  till the day was gone  and i sat in regret  in all the things i've done  for all that i've blessed  and all that i've wronged  in dreams till my death  i will wonder on   in your house  i long to be  room by room  patiently  i'll wait for you there  like a stone  i'll wait for you there  alone  alone   Goddess Bless.

      I do:) this is what happend when you run through the forest at 100 miles an hour and slip and smash your elbow into a rock. lol yes. it hurts. alot. I cant straighten it or bend it too much. it hurrrttsss. I would HATE to be perfect...I mean whats the fun in that? argh. I'm a fool. I hate males. they should all go burn in hell...yes they should. except Dj ashba and the rest of the guys we have shottied. lol I wish I had an island, actualyl you know what I wish? I wish I knew what I wanted. hmmpoh. it would be cool to have an island. complete with the internet and a phone. and a big ass stereo. :) and I would have smoothies whenever I wanted and it would be sunny whenever I wanted it too and it would rain everytime I asked it nicely to. I like mouses. I would have pet mouse on my island. same with a dragon. so actually I wouldnt want a computer with internet or a phone just the stereo. and the dragon would be able to talk to me and we would dance into the night and no one could tell us to go to sleep. we would sing some odd songs and we would make up our own. and the native people of the sea would surface and turn into beautiful little elves that would teach me how to run on snow. even if there wasnt any snow on my island, they would teach me how to run on water and then they'd clap and bow in honour of my completed teaching. then we would all run on water to the closest volcano and dance around the rim, singing odd hyms to the almighty Goddess. after we were done that we would jump into the volcano and be blown back to our island by a warm air current.:) that would be heaven. and I wouldnt have to deal with evil 'friends' or anything like that. although i would miss krystal, carrie and alesha. but they could come visit me on my pet dragon. yes. I would never leave that section of islands, cause there would be alot of them, so I wouldnt get to bored. :) yes, that sounds like a GRWEAT plan. *nods* and now I am going to go make an Ashba guild.

      really it is! I cannot stand it...lol I love it :) I have wank running through my head at 100 mph! lol...I am going to put up a joke from funny.com only..they are all realy bad jokes...  Sometimes, teachers hear students say the funniest and most embarassing things.... I had an eighth grade class of rowdies one semester not long ago.  One boy in particular, named James Bate was very rough and big and tall for his age. He could be very intimidating to fellow classmates. He had a habit of threatening fellow students in an unusual way. For example, if a student would say something to harass him like, "James, you are so stupid." James would reply with "I'll stupid you!" in his most threatening loud voice.  One day, another boy named Josh decided to upset James by using his last name in an offensive manner. Josh taunted, "Master Bate...Master Bate." And true to his style James replied in his most boisterous loud voice for all of the room to hear, "I'll Master Bate you!"  Not only did James turn red as he realized what he had yelled, but, the boy who decided to taunt him turned equally red. After that, I didn't hear anymore wisecracks out of either boy.  he he he...I like it. and it isnt even that rude! wow! thats a very very mild joke compared to the other ones...lol like the one I just read, a revision of a whole bunch of childrens rhymes. - Despite the many rat infested slums in New York City, only 311 people are bitten by rats in an average year. But 1,519 residents are bitten annually by other New Yorkers.... - The liver, not the heart, is the sign of romance in northern Morocco.... When a Moroccan girl falls in love she says, "Darling, you have stolen my liver." - The world's greatest lover was King Mongut of Siam. He had 9,000 wives.... Before dying of syphilis he was quoted as saying he only loved the first 700.... :)

       Blogger has changed!! it is all spiffy and stuff! I like it...although it kinda confused me...oh well. to all the moms out there happy mothers day!!  dude this thing is hot!! I love it...even though it is taking forever to load. If you hadnt noticed that my favorite key on the keyboard is the . key then you have noticed now...wait that made no sense...lol thats ok no one ever said I make sense, in fact no one ever says anything about me at all! ....well...wait thats not true...Maybe I should rephrase that...no one ever says anything good about me. there thats better. wow..god I am in a really bitter mood today. Not feeling to friendly. might have something to do with the pounding headache and sore throat I have. probably. oh and the fact that I didnt sleep very well last night cause i was on the most uncomfortable couch last night...I dont like victoria that much. well not when I go down there and end up not going anywhere fun, or that I wanna go.  please dont mind my complaining cause like I already I am feeling very bitter today. yup, actually I guess you could say thats an understatment. oh well. none of you's have to live with me. lucky you. ...-=I'm sorry that I hurt you, It's something I must live with everyday.=- thats a  really good song. I really do think I liketh more than I like more people. I dont like people. people and/or humans. and I cant decide if I dislike the female population more than the male population....or vice versa. I just basically hate them all. most of them. gaaar.....I feel like crying/killing something. maybe I should do both at the same time...only problem is I cant remember the last time I cried so I doubt I could make myself now...anywho, I have been typing alot these days...lets just blame it on the fact that I dont have a life. yes. thats a good idea.there everything is bold. whoop de doo. argh, I dont fucking care if the dumbass zelda game wasnt working before!! it isnt my fucking problem. stupid fucktards...sorry carrie mind if I borrow that word for today? I'm in need of it. anyways I think I should stop raving and go do something useful...wait I have nothing useful today!! so I will just go do something not useful....    Boo!.!

      I am so happy there isnt anyschool today. and I am a little happier that I translated krystals blog...poor little baby. I hate males. they are so....maddening. oh well...la la la la la.....adams song is REALLY good. It is my favorite song by Blink 182. well I am in a conferssing mood today so I am going to confess something...nope...my life isnt that interesting there is nothing I can really confess...hmm...*trying to think of something that I could confess.* lol it is a good thing I'm not catholic or christian or whichever it is that has those confession booths. lol I am a loser...oh well I do not  care much for not being a loser. sometimes us loser have more fun than the non losers, actually we always do! lol. I really am beginning to really like Bright Eyes. they are really good...and so are the Desaparcidos or however you spell it cause I dont fathom a clue :) I am very diffucult. I drive people insane  cause I can never make up my mind. see like that she got mad at me because I didnt answer her right away. maybe I shouldve just said no...lol that woulda done just as much good as not answering. she gets mad either way. so touchy!! oh wellish. I'm emotionally unstable :) yes thats what I sam going to confess! cause it is very true cause I am emotionally unstable. in fact I am not stable in any way whatso ever!! lol the book I am reading has alot of spelling mistakes...I wonder if anyone has told them that they suck at spelling...even if the book is kick ass. :) la la la la I like movies and t.v. even if I rarely watch them anyways. Girl Interrupted was the best movie ever. I want to be like Daisy when I grow up :) or maybe like Lisa cause she was a schizo....I have a odd fascination with schizo's and with gay men.lol. wow that must sound odd...:) thats ok I am odd. *cause I'm Broken* I real y like that song...I wish I could Sing Like Amy Lee. she has the most beautiful voice...*sighs with envy* the Willy Wonka Theme is odd..:) it is great though. *the fake sound of progress* thats a good song too. it is too bad I dont have a working c.d. with alot of good songs on it...*glares at newly burnt and non working c.d.*  the feeling's to intense, sitting on the fence...I really like the Lost Prophets. and alot of other bands but it would take me forever to list them and I would probably forget alot of them anyways...I cant delete my avatar and it is driving me loopy...lol I have said that to three people already this morning. krysstaallll I looovveee youuu....and now I am going to leave. bye bye.

I   !r!e!a!l!l!y!  want to do something different with my hair but it is the longest it has ever been so...bah! oh well...it is too bad I just cant walk into some piercing place and say "Pierce me." and they will. dammit I hate being young. -_- my head is all floaty..it doesnt feel attached to my body, maybe thats what happens when you ake too many Tylenol..meh. Maybe i should take some more...nah too lazy. I love Good Charlotte. yes. I still do. I was rediscovering that this morning because I was listening to them and I realized how much I still love their music. t'is true *nods* yes, I wish I could type really fast without looking at the keyboard..I do a fairly good job but not as fast as typing as I do without looking at the screen. maybe I should walk the dog...maybe I should do alot of things but that doesnt mean I'ma gonna do it! Like maybe I should change all the colours on my blog, but I dont paticularly feel like it. whoa. Instead of constantly looking at my hands I keep looking up at the screen. it is like my eyes are drawn to it. o.O he he he I loveth that face.

       I havent blogged in a while..I have nothing to blog about :( it is sad...maybe I should just make poems like everyone else has been doing. But I am no go at making poems :( bah oh well. I'MA LEADER NOT A FOLLOWER!! BAH HUMBUG oh yayness! drama camp starts tomorrow! yay, lol it is funny cause it isnt even a real camp :) yay. I'm gonna meet Ville. And we are  gonna get married and I am gonna be his bitch. he is really ugly but i can deal with that. He will teach me how to sing and his band will teach me how to play instruments and I will be an instumental playing bitch :) yay. I love Ville. I wish I knew him, him and Ashba, they both kick mega ass. yesh. Oh I got a mosquito bite on my forehead and it hurts because it has turned into a mini goose egg. Fuck I have been getting hurt alot. WHen I went camping I scratched up my legs and when we [krystal, ehran and I] went to the lake I got bruises all up and down both shins. lol then when I went riding today Cory [the horse I rode] decided he had 'light feet' and so he decided to start cantering....in the bushes :/ But it was fun, although My left arm got all bloody :) it was great. I love trail rides. Bah. I hate my knife, because currently I dont have it:( and it makes me sad. Oh well when I go into Cumberland tomorrow I can go to Alesha's and I think I left it there. *fuck fuck fuck I am angry with my skateboard* lol it is funny cause I dont have a skateboard. My brother has three but I'm not allowed to use any of them. Fucktard parents :( Fuck I hate gaia. It isnt working but gawds it is so fucking addictive. I am so glad I dont do any drugs or drink, I'd get so freaking hooked O_O and it would be bad. It would be a very slow form of suicide. HEY! you know what I just realized? My uncle indirectly commited suicide!! Cause he got lung cancer and died from smoking! OMFG! How could I not realize that? bah talk about blind. Oh well. I really have nothing to say other than listen to HIM...or else. :) well ciao my pretties >.

      I think I shall blog in here every once in a while. Or if I am in an insanely good mood. But this is my life currently: Today I am going to Pitt to go camping in Manning Park with my Krystal and co. Yay. My stepgrama is dying and when I get back from Pitt they expect her to be dead. I finished reading one of the most amazing series in my life. I havent been sleeping well so I am exhausted. My riding was cancelled this morning due to rain. I have no books to read and I cant go to the library. On the bright side I have no other news.

        It was so dissapointing. The rides were boring, except for the roller coaster, the original. I got a mini sunburn from sitting on the bus in the sun. No one ever comments on my blog anymore. :( it's sad. I havent been on the computer which is saying lots since I have been at grammas and the computer there is 100 times faster than this one. which I am just learning now. I honestly think that jim should just fucking re-install the whole windows xp. Or something. I dunno, just clear it out and get rid of all the  stupid pop up things that wont go the fuck away. bah, I wish I was as molerat. I dont even know what a molerat is but....I'd rather be one. OMF! there was alot of guyses there. and one had REALLY pretteh hair! I shottied him. But he looked like he was 13 or so. Well he looked young. But he was kinda hot anyways.

          ..I dont pay enough attention to the people around me. I always focus on me, me me me me. I'm becoming a self centered, sour old bitch. I need to be there for my friends more, especially for things that i have gone through before and know how it feels. I will be there for you, from now on, if somethings wrong...e-mail, PM's, MSN or the phone...I'll do my best to help. I feel so...stupid. Quite frankly I am ashamed at myself for being so blind. I need to open my eyes more. I got a rude awakening and that is why I am typing this. I do care about my friends.  Alot . I know that must sound sentimental and stuff but if anything ever happened to you guys I'd be absoulutely broken. I'd be so...empty. I don't really have anything but my friends. Oh sure I have my books and the computer and my family. But books can't talk with me and the computer doesn't make me laugh. My family...I don't eally know about my family. I guess I do love them..maybe. But my friends are my life, without my friends I wouldn't have life. Please forgive my sentimentality and all that but I need you to know.      Oh my god you're so lonely
