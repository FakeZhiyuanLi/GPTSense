      Nothing much happen today, other than a pleasent surprise when carolyn asked me out for coffee. probably spent half of the day watching her copying recipe out from a cook book she borrowed out of the library.  On a lighter note:  I was praying Last night and was thinking about those that I have the most difficult time understanding. Those that hurt us and are not sincere in their love for others, those that are the most difficult for us to love, that give others a really hard time in life, times of heartache and trial, and I asked the Father,  "Why Lord, why do I have to love those who don't love me or make any effort to want me and who persecute me?"  And He said to me,    "Because I have loved you when you didn't want Me, My child.   I reached out for you when you would not embrace Me, I cried for you when you couldn't cry, I cared for you when you didn't think about Me.The ones you have not cared for and put aside as if they were not there were abused by you and shunned, that is how I feel when you do this to Me, because when you have done this to others, this is how much you love Me. The one you love the least in the world is how much you love Me.   Inside of each person in the world, each soul, there is Me, and when you don't love, when there is anger and regret and jealousy in you toward another, it is Me that you feel this way toward, I Am a part of that person, each person on earth no matter what they are or what they do, and I Am asking you to love Me, and to love Me is to pray for each person you meet that the person will become a part of me by loving me and turning to Me for help and peace in their lives. This, my child, is how you love Me, by loving the person that you think is impossible to love, for caring for the person and praying for the person to make his or her life better on this earth. Through Me all things are possible!"    I said,  "Lord, help me! I can't do it by myself, take my hand and hold it, hold onto me and don't let me fail you again, Lord!!"  I thought then about all those in my past that I could have helped if I had just taken the time, those I had hurt verbally, those who reached out to me and I was not there to help them, those I walked away from in fear or anger or frustration and those I find it so hard to love. When I feel His Presence so very close to me His love overwhelms me and amazes me and the tears stream down my face as I cry out to Him for help,  "I love You, Lord!!"  I can't do anything, even the simplest thing without Him, I never really ever could, I just thought I could!  "MY command is this: Love each other as  I (GOD)  have loved YOU" John 15:12

      The world moves on, Life goes on. People Change, times change.  I have to adapt to the changing of the tides, or suffer being swept out to Sea or buried under the waves.  Moring started out fine. After a really nice chat with a friend from another church, being the first time I think I made her cry, but then I had to pacify her till like 7AM in the morning!   so I woke up at 1pm in the afternoon today. The one good thing I got out of last's night's conversation.  I came to terms with somthing I said to Kelly before we broke up. I guess I shall stick to that statement that I made then.  the 2 nights before we broke up, I was sleeping at her place, I couldn't sleep as I felt somthing was wrong.  On the day we broke up, I clearly remembered saying to her, "The Kelly I once loved so much  is Gone, you may look, sound and smell like her. but the Girl that I once knew. the One I fell in love with, whom I love to hold in my arms and tell her every other day that how how special she was to me. who was so sweet that she made me somthing for my birthday, even I didn't know her had changed, changed into somthing I don't even reconise now."  The events that happen days before, confirmed that thought. Probably I held on to the hope that she'll return. cause I loved her. I would say up till NOW, of all the Girls I have known, She's the one I loved the most, sacrificed the most and put my everything into the relationship.  Of all the people, no one Knew what I was going through, ONLY ME. and the reasons why I was angry most of the times, was that I was not MAD at her but MAD about her.  What came out from all these, was my ability use what I have learnt and experience as a stepping stone, rather than a burden I carry.  And it made me realize that it is a very good to to open them up to the GOSPEL too. Thanks to all who have enourage. These are those who stand beside me and still are.   I have more problems ahead of me,of which money, dental and even church. all I have to carry. more of it next time.   "my mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give me understanding"  Psalms 49:3

       "The Lord has hidden himself from his people, but I trust him and place my hope in him"  Isaiah 8:17  Friendships are often tested by separation and silence; you are divided  by physical distance or you are unable to talk - same with your relationship with God too.  To mature your friendship, God will test it with periods of seeming separation.  Besides Jesus, David probably had the closest friendship with God of anyone. God took pleasure in calling him   "a man after my own heart"  1 sam 13:14, Acts 13:22  Yet david frequently complained of God's aparent absence:   "Lord, Why are you standing aloof and far away? Why do you hide when I need you the most?"  PSALMS 10:1  " why have you forsaken me? Why do you remain so distant? Why do you ignore my cries for help " PSALMS 22:1   "Why have you abandoned me?"  PSALMS 43:2  When God Seems distant, you may feel that he is angry with you or is disciplining you for some sin. In fact, Sin does Disconnect us from intimate fellowship with God.   But often this feeling of abandonment or estrangemennt from God has nothing to do with Sin. It is a test of faith - one we all must face:  will you continue to Love, Trust, Obey and worship God, even when you have no sense of his presence or visible evidence in your life?    I did . I'm actually a happier man.

      Today begins the day with Disturbing news from Kelly. Not so much as I didn't know this was happening, but then again. It was somthing out from she herself.  After the news, I just felt, there's really no point in holding on whatever I was holding on to anymore. Although the memories still linger there.  It's the same scenario when Carol told me that she was attached already. since she had found someone, I guess I shouldn't be left with spilled milk anymore. and for Kelly, the way she described this new guy, The spilled milk had already turned GREEN and was giving off a bad smell.  set off early to see my "sister" Valerie selling things ar City link. Awww...I know your Legs are aching!  Best thing today? I attended a friend's wedding at Old Parliment House today. It's was DROP DEAD GRAND!!! out of the 4 weddings out from my church, I would say today is the BEST! we were seated in the Parliment fashion room where the old ministers like Ahmad Ibrahim and Goh Keng Swee used to hold their parlimentry meetings. There were these few seats in front that were labeled with the names of the ministers. ONE had the name "LEE KUAN YEW". The wedding was so beautiful. with the Groom wearing a suit that you would only see in those fairy tales prince type of dressing. If you did watch Disney "beauty and the BEAST" what the beast wore, it was to that genre type of dressing.  Who went, POWER 98 DJ Soo WEI!!! and Channel U news CREW!!!  For younger generation, Imagine IORI -from King of Fighters   Awsome FOOD reception too, although not much left of the food. but Extremely AWSOME. from Satay to Hong Kong noodles to French Loaf with Egg and Cavair.  If that was not enough, we later went to YA KUN for more FOOD! oh gosh. I'm gonna Burst after that...  now I'm home, filled and satisfied. So ends another eventful weekend.  ("For I know the plans I have for you" declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future") Jeremiah 29:11  *D2 LADDER SEASON 1 ENDING! - THIS IS SO DISCOURAGING!"

      I would consider today a Good day, haven't had good days recently, but Today I'll probably count as a Good day.  Woke up at 12 as usual, did nothing much as yesterday I slept at 6am yet again. thinking over some stuff. I must try to change my sleeping pattern, I'll need to wake up by 6am next time I start work!  Events of today include meeting up Darrel with Alvin *3 musketters unite!* as Dee is going away to ENGLAND for 2 months. *Lucky BUM!!*  As we sat at LIPS cafe Rivited by His plans to backpack to Paris, Rome and Vieanna.  Awww... I guess I'll probably go there on my honeymoon, If I can find the cash.  *keeping my fingers XX*  then left for Paragon to meet Another friend, Lina. She being Late, left me with some time to actully roam around Paragon. This place brings back memories, As you walk along the empty ailse of some of the back shops,   I remembered the times I used to go Shopping with Kelly. I would put my hands in my pocket as we walked, then she'll come and slip her arm into my arm. I would look into her eyes, as I felt she had the most beautiful eyes, I would say to her "I LOVE YOU" and she would say "I LOVE YOU TOO" back at me. Just then, her image would fade away and I was left all alone in the ailse.  somehow, we Went to K-box to Sing, it's a nice place. since K-BOX was set up, this is the first time I am going fo it. actually an interesting place with a good environment and well, Impressed with this reception girl who actually looked like "MI xue". AND! best of all, she reminded me of this GIRL I used to like when I was still in primary 5. Puppy love then. Don't think she's her, she went RGS and RJC. Don't think she'll be htat desperate to end up in K-box customer service reception.  Kelly always say I listen to English songs and never to chinese songs. lets see, the Song "Bu zhou" by Du De wei and "tong ku de ren" by Wu Bai, WEll.... ALL THANX TO K BOX! These are the only 2 SONGS I CAN SING WITH EMOTION! Gosh!  Other than the song by du De wei, made me think of Kelly. Maybe it's because of the lyrics. *gosh, I must really STOP doing this.*  Overall,I really enjoyed myself today. Not much to pour out today. My thanx to Lina.  "naked I came from my mother's womb and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised." JOB 1:21

      As I sit here in front of my PC, writing down my thoughts for the Day.  This morning I was rudly awaken by an old friend wanting to meet. but later his wife got into an accident and he had to attend to her. *no idea what happened hmmm....*  Actually went down Ngee Ann today, met AZHAR and EDWIN. Friend's events company was hosting the freshman orientation camp for their business school.  Seeing the whole crowd of 200 students cheering and shouting, you find it interesting that I pictured Kelly in the crowd. Just happily cheering, being the girl she is. then I remembered 7 years ago, when I attended camps with that much power in them. and a year later, Hosting one!  Other than the memories, the few of us from the Radio Academy including me, were all Gawking at the the many Women there! YES, NGEE ANN Still LIVES up to it's REPUTATION! all beautiful women come from NGEE ANN... and All GOOD LOOKING GUYS *ahem!!* COme from SINAPORE POLY!  Tonight, My concerns is more on what has God planned for me throughout this year, the church is going into this time of Missions and I guess, there's this tugging at my heart that I would like to go on one this time round. What should I call it, my Virgin mission!  I pray for sponsorship.   other concerns are that I need to re-record my Demo disc again as the one from the Radio academy was horrid.  Most interesting thing came out from the day, is that I am currently reading this really good book called "the purpose driven life" 40 chapter to a "changed" life. It's really a interesting book on how to worship, and prayer and stuff. then what plagued me is that, well  what will happen after I finished this book?  Thanx to a good Sister, well she laid my fears to rest as we grow, you'll generally get fresh revelations from the bible and God will probably speak to you.  Reflecting back on the Past,  I guess that I may have been passionate about God in the past but I lost that desire at one point. Breaking up with Kelly was a wake up call for me I guess. I even remebering asking God that if she wasn't the one that was suppose to be, let her be taken away from me. sometimes, you ask these things from God and poof, they happen and you get so hurt by them.  Pain is the fuel for passion - it energizes us with an intesity to change what we don't normally change.  "DOES THE LORD DELIGHT IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES AS MUCH AS IN OBEYING THE VOICE OF THE LORD? TO OBEY IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE...." 1 SAMUEL 15:22  Indeed I guess I was spending more time with Her than with God. At one point I would actually say to myself, Kelly you're the only thing that mattered to me. - much more than GOD.  Advice to Readers:   I am grateful for the blessings in my life now, and I accept the events in my life as gifts of growth that create strength of character and strength of faith.

      Gosh, another day of Chilling out at home. Awaken at 10:30 in the morning. romping round my place, watched the remining part of matrix revolutions and wanted to watch this DVD of "the DAY AFTER TOMORROW" but found that, the quality was so horrible that I rather watch my the way the water spins when I flush my toilet!...  On the Gaming, I could level up my necromancer on D2 till 15. in just about an hour! interesting.  at night, of course being a Thursday night, it's CG night. Of all the message that was preached, the message had to be "building a life with commitment"  one of the points that actually struck me, was the one that goes "commitment to people". going on a lighter note, I guess it was a normal.  When our cell group leader talked about commitment in Marriage, about someone on the radio telling the story about how his wife is filing for a divorce as she was not commited to him. and highlighted the importance of commitment in a Marriage or relationship  It's not that I never heard these kind of stuff before, nor this is like somthing foregin to me.  it placed many questions in my heart, I wondered what the word "commited/commitement" meant. I was then reminded of an incident of which I had always replayed in my mind, I remembered the days when I and kelly would be arguing and sometimes I would shout out, "you know I would do anything for you!" ....and she would answered back, "so would I!"...  and I remembered retorting back one time "would you be commited to me?" and I drew back silence.  this brings me to a Question what is "commitment" to me, to me, I usually define it as "HOLDING ON WHEN THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO HOLD" commitment grows stronger over pressures. not weaken. A huge world of difference between the oppsite a "PREFERENCE", or in other terms a strong belief.   *it'll be too long if I'm going to explain the difference here - this you can only get from the HORSE'S mouth*  I have my next instruction from up above already and it's not a good one I guess. It's gonna be very very diffcuilt, but I'll live through it, if it happens.  "Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him." JAMES 1:12

      Pulling the 2 plastic bags conataining Stephanine's Playstation I walked my way to Compass point.   I found Steph at one of the tables, put the two bags on the Table and left in a Hurry. I didn't even bother to say Goodbye or Hello.  Walking back, a sadness came over me. walking towards the Traffic lights, Tears start streaming down my eyes. I told myself, I said I'll never cry for someone like her. It didn't hurt then, Why did it Hurt now?  Maybe I envied my first love Kelly that she found someone. probably both of them have someone, and yet I asked why am I on this Thing called a VOW. 1 year.  I opened the Door to my car, shut it behind me and let out a shout of anguish, Burst into Tears over the steering wheel.   some how I feel like a Failure. You go on with Kelly, 11 months, all your friends blame you for making her LET me GO, she's Going like "YOU ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE SO GREAT" - Words like sharp piercing arrows through your HEART.  True enough I didn't Love steph at all. I made her my replacement for KELLY. she knew it too then.  Everyone else seems to be happy and with a partner.   Just feel so upset that sometimes you just want to become a monk. away from all the hurt, pain and the things around you.  cried while driving all the way home. sometimes fearing to Trust God for that promise, that only by faith will come to pass. FAITH is tested when u can't see the Road ahead.  Had a Talk with my Mom about them, told me stories about how my Dad was when he broke up with the 1st girl he loved. re-told their love story to me. told of how my aunt met her husband and what happened before that. Another aunt who knew her husband thru uni and national service, got married yet 2 years later had a divorced.  Encouraged me saying "When you love and move on, then you will GROW UP. all 1st love is painful. that's life, you need to GROW UP."  Talked about Stephanie, saying she is ALREADY getting what she deserved anyway. and Kelly, she said, if Kelly choose the right person, turn back to God, then her life will be ok. and If not, she'll probably follow the same fate as Stephanie. who knows!!  As I sit here in front of My PC, Tear still running down my eyes, I thank God for My mom. My greatest hero. whose word of encouragement did more healing than any of my friends who tried to help or blammed me for whatever happened between KEL and me. I LOVE YOU MOM.  God, I know you're testing my Faith today, TESTING if I'll carry on my Promise with you. I pray for strength, determination and your encouragement.  "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing" James 1:2-4

      Just came back from my 1st spin gig at Mojo radio. Gosh. they closed early today due to the LINKIN Park Concert, NO ONE CAME TO THE PUB!  oh well, did my 45 min playing of music, JPOP EURO DANCE all the way. now I find that the songs are really monotonous. and the beats are like ALL THE SAME. maybe cause they were all those PARA PARA type of music. *oh crap*  didn't get to play my 2nd session! hooray! then again the 2nd session was like all those JPOP songs, like SMAP lionheart...etc.etc.  This morning, went to work at 1pm. Thank God, I woke up at 11pm. after a sleepless in Singapore type of night.  came to work and my collegue came in wearing this brown jacket. and guess what, it was that "DEAR KELLY" jacket Kelly used to have, but her's was Black instead. My collegue's a really nice girl though. I guess all women are nice at some point. till you look a little closer to find somthing else.  Talking with some people over the pub, somehow reminded me of Kelly. there's one that's like  grappling with her boyfriend having to 2 time her and yet still stick like glue to him.  You wonder why you never meet these kind of people, or why she wasn't this kind of girl. BEST still HOW COME THE GIRLS YOU MEET ARE SO "ADULTERESS" *couldn't find the lighter version of the word...sorry*  Just came to terms that, what we did in OCT 2003. I thought that Could let her stick to me. I mean really keep her. but look what happen in the END.  As Linkin Park's Song goes "IN THE END, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER!!" You though you won, but well...life's has a sadistic way to hit you back with a brick.  Just then, I was reminded of things such as FEELINGS and LOGIC. As they exist in 2 different sides of the BRAIN, when FEELING/EMOTIONS come into play, LOGIC steps out. and when LOGIC comes into play, FEELINGS/EMOTIONS step out.  I reconize my feelings for Kelly are still Strong. but reconizing Logic, you get things like  "she's Condemned already"..."Why salvage the Business you do in the Toilet. stop looking at  the Damn thing, stop dreaming about that great meal you ate and flush it down!"  that's why maybe God made us this way. left brain Go left and the OTHER SIDE GOES RIGHT. Logic and Emotions pull different ways, which side do we go? Sensible or Senseless??  the following Doesn't make it any better, I Recieved news she's attached alreay. oh well, then there really is no hope then.  This year I rest and heal, and press the "Flush" button. Carry God's presence around. Love God. and Pray for that special someone to come. I'd rather go for someone who can commit. rather than fool around.   "DO NOT FRET BECAUSE OF EVIL MEN, R BE ENVIOUS OF THOSE WHO DO WRONG; FOR THEY ARE LIKE GRASS THEY WILL SOON WITHER, LIKE GREEN PLANTS THEY WILL SOON DIE AWAY." PS 37:1-2  AND  "TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD; DWELL IN THE LAND AND ENJOY SAFE PASTURE. DELIGHT YOURSELF IN THE LORD HAD HE WILL GIVE YOU THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART" PS 37:3-4  God you know my desire.

      First day of work, where they bring us to, this REALLY impressive skyscraper in the heart of Singapore!  YES capatol building! That's where we have our "training" or shall I say, more of a hear our lecturer Brag about somthing we like have no interest to listen, or I would say, she could really cut the whole thing short and ZIP to "there's the WEB SITE" go Fiddle yourself!  Ok, Crap aside. This building is super interesting. to get to your office, you have to go to the 36!! YES 36TH FLOOR to sit a lift to your office!!  talk about Altitude problem. you work there, no fear of that. everyday you'll dealing with the rapid changing of atmospheric pressures.  the view up on the 36th Floor is just Superbly impressive! window that looks out onto all the other buidings in the CBD. somehow you wish you have a digital camera to capture the view! *sigh*  my collegues were impressive too, one from Korea and another from Shanghai. the lady from Korea lives at Serangoon Circus, whereas the one form Shanghai lives somewhere in bukit panjang!  Korean lady is a small sized cute but claims she is very much OLDER than me. Married *sorry guys* . and well, can't speak much english. To me, my thoughts is that she's a very Smart woman, and how she met her HUSBAND, it was thru the INTERNET!! *MIRACLES DO HAPPEN!!*  now on to a more interesting specimen, the Shanghai girl. she Look alot like one of my friends. Geez, can't remember her name. SEET Ling's SISTER. darn, but the more Aunty version of her la. and she like much much fairer than her.  Talking about people from Shanghai, there was this report in the Sunday papers that Shanghai beauties are Trendy and HIGH EQ and romantic. *wonder if it's true*  For those who are tuning into the KATH scene, yes, met her AT MOJO today with her "EX"...*awww* but anyway, I just went there to chill. so no much expectation. what else, Did I comment that I find her voice really unique. maybe that's why I feel somewhat attracted to her in some ways.   hmmm...I may go into my lecture on how Smell and attraction are closely associated...but not in the Blog.  One thing I'm happy about doing, is that I invited her to Church, well, let God do the rest then.   Too bad, 1 year, even MISS SINGAPORE UNIVERSE or RACHEL LEE comes along the way.  Bo bian, they have to wait till next year 22nd JUNE! *remind myself constantly*  in the world have lots of Roadside GRASS and TRESS. very few flowers, most flowers either trampled on or kena pick already ... ahahhaha  "Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised." PRO 31:30

      GReat, woke up around 11 am, started on my Songs, burned my DJ music bed.  printed all the track list of my CDs and placed them in my CD album. all ready for tuesday JPOP gig.  GREAT, that's Done and POOF! got a message from Debbie and TIM,  screaming "are you supporting me for IDOL. my audition is at 3:30" and Golly, they SMS me at 2:45!!  did my superhero change routine, on with the contact lenses, gel up the Hair, and was really to leap off my roof and propelled myself towards Suntec. YES, got there. SUNTEC car park was totally FULL! oh Gosh, had to drive to Marina square. worse of it all, today was not only IDOL, there was this Ren ci hospital carnival and to make things worse DRAGON BOAT RACE carnival. whole lots of people. Little parking space. reached there late.   Debbie came out, looked really Good with make up on and stuff. She should do that more often, you look younger! *oops* but that's the truth.  waited in the waiting room. though if I caught Debbie comming out, it'll be like 3 time on TV, and Gurmit would probably go "OH IT'S YOU AGAIN!" yeah, but all to time constraints.  I was forced to leave, just as Deb went into the room. DARN. didn't catch her!  have a really nice chat with some of the people in the waiting room. had a fun time there, as everyone was like so DEAD and quiet. probably I'm like the only life there. GOSH!  I had to go meet up with a certain girl called Shannon. Really nice girl. tall, meaty and looks really good with an apple in her mouth over a bed of red hot charcoal.*oh sorry*   so anyway, we were deciding what to eat and she pointed to KENNY ROGERS. Great, hadn't eaten that in a long while. although I had Yong Tau Foo LAKSA on my mind instead!  then again, that was good too.   Surprised I was, She treated me to dinner! cool! praise the lord.  we then proceeded to Esplanade where we sat down by the pier, as the sky turned dark and the  lights from Fullerton hotel and merlion came up, the sight was just fantastic.  had a good talk, but some how she was lacking this bit of spark in the way she talked.  She's a good friend none the less. thanx for the Meal. Loved it so much.  Tomorrow will me my 1st day at work. new job. wonder what are challenges in store for me! and WILL KATH Ask me out tml? we'll see. :)

      Great, just finished Idol. now to tell the WORLD I FAILED and made a hell of a FOOL of myself on Camera!  sure to get on TV! that's for SURE!  Sometimes worrying is not What you tell to your friends, is Who you tell them to.  through all the "congrats you made to 2nd round but cheer up, try harder next time" sms, was my conversation with Kelly.  never had I have long SMS chats with anyone. not even with Steph!  what troubled me through out the long stream of messages, was somthing that said "I was more concern about earning money and working"  man can only serve one master. God or mammon*aka money*  I sometimes find it so hard at someone her age to just be focusing on money.  Talking to Mom about some issues about family today, and our talk draw back to Kelly yet once more. Although I felt uncomfortable with what she commented, I felt that it was a correct comment from her. she said that Kelly had the maturity of HER age, compared to another girl in my family. whom she had lost her mother at an early age. so she had to grow up much faster than most girls at her age. playing both mother and Daughter at the same time. Best of all, she's much younger than Kelly!  Another friend commented that a girl at her age, going through whatever she had gone through would have probably freaked out already. emotional tension for her would have been overwhelming. She probably though alot about lots of things.  Being a guy, sometimes I wonder what made me so emotional about all this, then it struck me, she's probably much worse. and I guess it's probably so. like 10 times what I'm going through. from the way she SMS, i could guess it.  "Those who wait upon the lord will renew their strength..." ISA 40:31  My promise was that I was to be bound 1 year to the Lord before I am released. and on the promise lie my reward.  I pray that Kelly will seek wisdom, find strength, carry not her burdens. and may God lead her onto the right path.

      here's my 3rd copy of the Report on the Singapore Idol! Lousy Blog  Idol was a good time to have fun and throw out some of what was commanded to me during the emerge conference.  I went in, with a sore throat, gave my best. got stopped in the middle of the Song *thanx DICK*   then got some interesting remarks like. "why do you flutter your eyelids" and other stuff.  anyway, I was trying to maintain eye contact with the judges through out the song.  Probably the emotion could come out. come to think of it, I should have pictured kelly sitting in the judges place...maybe there I can find that emotion of the song! *come what may*  I really have no idea how to sing with emotion.   The good thing that came out of it, was a comment from Douglas O, he said I was more cut out to be a DJ rather than a Singer.  Dream come true? that's a good comment I guess. Radio I loved it eons ago. All credits to Colin G.....  what has the emerge conference have to do with Singapore Idol? during the emerge conference, I inspired to share an idea, to start Singapore's 1st Christian radio station. namely INSPIRATION FM. to the judges of Singapore Idol.  True enough I asked for a Sign, 2 in fact. I asked that KElly will contact me. and she DID. she sms me somthing one of the nights. and during the 1st round I was able to get thru to 2nd so that I was able to meet up with the 4 people.  Signs fufilled, my duty done. I obeyed.  after that, we celebrated over east coast lagoon food center. really nice place to eat. had a good SMS chat with Kelly that night. more thought in the next entry

      Just came back from celebrating with the people from church who supported me during the Singapore Idol.  it's a great meal, and a good time to celebrate too, not that I got into Singapore Idol, but I just kicked off the show.  I accomplished what I was told to do.  this may be crazy, but during the Emerge conference I was given a word about this incident, I was to go to the IDol competiton and "market" this idea to one of the judges of Singapore IDOL.  got pass the 1st round. so well, went on to the Judges and did whatever I was told. I knew I wasn't able to get to second round of the competition. But as I said, if I was to be a planter of a seed, then I'll plant this seed.  During the Audition, My throat was sore for some reason and my voice cracked at the critical moment, and I was stopped mid way thru the song. whatever they commented was, I WAS CUT OUT MORE TO BE A DJ RATHER THAN A SINGER!!! WHOOO HOO!!!! .... YEAH!!  RADIO ACADEMY RULEZ!! Colin, this one's for you.  wonder what's the next step for me? By God's grace. CHC choir?  Chatted with Kelly on SMS again as I was going home. Don't understand why she won't talk to me on the phone. I mean I won't eat her up or anything, then again. somehow she gave me an impression she's like obsessed with money. and like I'll do anything for money. I actually felt pity hear this from her. I used to have some regard for her, but somehow you hear this comming from someone who is like 7 years your junior. somehow you just feel like it's not right, like you see a little boy playing on the road, knowing one day if he carries on playing there, he'll get hit by a car. but you're helpless to do anyhing.  Reminds me that, sometimes, it not that God can't help your situation. it's that when you Sow unbelief, you Drain God power from him to use.  I think I'll pray for her, that's all I can do. Pray that she'll seek wisdom. that the lord will guide her onto the right path. Somthing I was happy about, I gave her so much until I almost died at one time, no regrets on short changing her.  "better to live in the desert than with a quarrelsome and ill-tempered wife." Pro 21:19  For me, it's another weekend and still be reminded that today is Father's DAY. plan to burn all my disc and label them for Tuesday Gig at MOJO.  On the HUNT?... This girl Kathleen, she's really nice. different from most girls I know. there's somthing about this girl, somthing different, and I'll like to find out what. I have somthing that comes to mind that I need to talk to her about... maybe this Monday, if she asks me out to MOJO. *dream dream dream*

      then Jesus said to his diciples, "if anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" Matt 16:24  ---------------------------------------------------------------  1 year, My cross I'm taking it to calvary. Like simon who carried the Cross with Jesus. I guess he's carrying it with me.

      As the week comes to a close and sling shot into another weekend. I guess it'll be an eventful Saturday with Singapore Idol and all.  then comes Sunday. Father's day. I think about my DAD, I see other people's father.  I pray about being DAD being the head of the family. the leader. the Protector. someone who is that pillar of strength. AS the bible say, the KING, the prist and...*can't remember the last one*  honor my dad. That sometimes I find so hard to do. I blame him that he threw me out of the house for a very small incident. I think I said somthing he didn't like.  but in the end I stayed at Kelly's place for a week plus. this really stretched our relationship further apart during that week. I mean I was already fustrated during the time in the ARMY. and this wasn't making it any better.  the Army had no place for me to sleep, so I was the "stay out" personel. but then I was kicked out of my house, by Dad. and If I went back, my mom will kena from him.  between me and Kelly, small quarrels became big ones. and larger ones became huge ones!  then came the faithful day. 1 month before my Birthday. 19 FEB. that's it, the whole thing was over. I was like going crazy during those times.  I can still remember, God talking to me, when I got thrown out. he said,"this is going to be the hardest time in your relationship, it's a make it or break it situation"  and I still remembered being very proud of myself saying,"it won't happen to me !"  and so the Story Goes. Do I blame God, or DAD for throwing me out? I didn't blame God, but I blammed my Dad. If he didn't throw me out. would me and her still be together today?  I think she Still hates me for bursting out at her.  Actually I feel like crying when I think about this.  ~sorry I can't write anymore.

      Anger is a condition in which the tongue works faster than the mind.   You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying over the future.  Love ......and you shall be loved.  God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with Him.  All people smile in the same language.  A hug is a great gift..one size fits all. It can be given for any occasion and it's easy to exchange.  Everyone needs to be loved...especially when they do not deserve it.  The real measure of a man's wealth is what he has invested in eternity.  Everything has beauty but not everyone sees it.  It's important for parents to live the same things they teach.  If you fill your heart with regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you have no today to be thankful for.  Happy memories never wear out.... relive them as often as you want.  Home is the place where we grumble the most, but are often treated the best.  Man looks at outward appearance but the Lord looks within.  The choice you make today will usually affect tomorrow.  Take time to laugh for it is the music of the soul.  If anyone speaks badly of you, live so none will believe it.  Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears.  Love is strengthened by working through conflicts together.  The best thing parents can do for their children is to love each other.  Harsh words break no bones but they do break hearts.  To get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it.  We take for granted the things that we should be giving thanks for.  Love is the only thing that can be divided without being diminished.  Happiness is enhanced by others but does not depend upon others.  You are richer today if you have laughed, given or forgiven.  For every minute you are angry with someone, you lose 60 seconds of happiness that you can never get back.  Do what you can, for who you can, with what you have, and where you are.  THE BEST GIFTS TO GIVE:  To your friend - loyalty  To your enemy - forgiveness;  To your boss - service;  To a child - a good example;  To your parents - gratitude and devotion;  To your mate - love and faithfulness;

      Just came back from another eventful day of Cell Group.  shared out for the first time. YES me. Opened my mouth for the 1st time in CG to share God's word PSalms 91:4....  it was suppose to be that story of a bird who tried to save her hatchlings from a forest fire that she covered her little ones with her WINGS, and she herself perished in the Falmes of the Forest fire. the WINGS OF GOD.  BUT I STOPPED short...pooped stooped and Fumbled. and went ER... ER.... and that was it! and best of all I saw everyone's eyes wide open in a gawking manner to what I was sharing. Then, in a Split second, I heard the VOICE "I AM PROUD OF YOU!". and in that very moment. I said, "oh God, must you do this to me"...*sigh*  This is my fear, and yes, the very stage fright that I got when I was not prepared or did things impromtu. FEAR always has been paralysing. giving a hold on you. vowing never to let go.  I guess Tomorrow I'll call up the telephone company to inform them I shall take the job as a Part time. though it is less money. but I guess it's a good way to have a flexible time schedule. Less money for more flexibility. worth it?  a friend gave me an advice that is to take part time first and see the work load. if it not as much and I can still cope, then ask for the job Full time. talk with the company about it though. GREAT, THAt's Settled.  Vern was talking to me about being how it was to feel that I was taken out of the CG guitarist. My answer was that I guess God had other plans for me. if I couldn't serve that, which I think I am not meant to be there. I was to serve somewhere else. and if CG doesn't need my help. Then at best, I'll serve God everyday. having God's Presence with me when I talk to people, be with people, and shake some off to the people around me.  God didn't write 2COR 4:7 for nothing .....TREASURE CHESTs are nothing without TREASURE. Further more, we have a never ending supply of TREASURE that is in our LORD JESUS CHRIST. how more valuable are we, A treasure chest that when you Take TREASURE out from, and it NEVER GOES EMPTY!!!  and it goes on in 2COR 4:8,9 to explain to us how Rigid and strong we have become in Christ. "We are HARD PRESSED on every side, but not crushed; PERPLEXED but not in DESPAIR; PERCUTED but not ABANDONED; STRUCK DOWN, but not DESTROYED."  I struggled with my past, my hurts, my money problems, my search for a good woman, My guilt. MY DEMONS...........but I always get up.   SORROW looks BACK, WORRY Looks AROUND, FAITH looks UP. God bless all who read this

      Thought I was gonna spend another lonesone night at home again, but it wasn't what I had though.  every minture there's somthing new to learn.  Firstly, I'm happy with my BLOG!!! whoohoo finally I got it to look more like that I had expected it to look like.  although that PHOTO IS WAY WAY too big...I'll find some other photo which is not so big to place there!  talking with a very old friend tonight. well again I had another view of what happens to realtionship gone bad. his was nearly not as long as mine, the feeling of being 2 timed isn't somthing a guy could usually have taken, likewise the same as what I have been through.   This reminds me of a similar case I had handled in the past.  it's about a girl whom was with this guy for 5 years. everyone thought they were about to get married. but then, things happend, superstition it may be, but she lost her engagement ring at one point. but they broke up about 2 weeks later. *obviously she advised me that rings are a bit like an indicator of relationship status*  When people come, and if they are not meant to be in your life. then they will be like the grass that withers away. no matter what happens. maybe an Abortion, Kids, Years spent together, RINGS?  well, I had my share of pain too I guess, and the sadest thing in my life, I usually teach people I love about how a relationship should be run. Putting up various signs, stuff about Jealousy, intimacy and Love, just to avoid the minefields and pitfalls. yet when you come to them. you just stumble into them yourself!  For example: somtimes you think, after having kids, your other party will stick to you. is that true? many cases I've heard  have proved me wrong. It happends. Simple as that, and sometimes you just get so scared to step out.  Looking on the Brighter side of things, I always remind myself, Whatever had happened to me at this point. the things I have gone thru, *those who know me will know what I have been thru* even my worst fear of "wearing the GREEN CAP". *yep, I survived that too* .....I am still Human, and I do make mistakes in life.  and I'm the same as all of you. I have my own demons to Wrestle every night.   The difference, I have this courage to face my mistakes, my fears and  my life. using what I have learnt not as a disadvantage, but as a stepping stone, to help teach and share.  I thank God for what I have been through, people I see, Lives I touched, and lives I Lived as they shared.  KELLY, between You and GOD, I choose God.

      Prehaps it's fate I guess, this morning I took up this the Goals I set at the beginning of this year. and look what I had written down to do.  looking down the column, I had this Goal that was to be more patient and not lose my temper easily.  and on the column on how to go about doing it, there was this sentence. "ask Kelly for help"  well well, life twist and turns. still I wrestle everyday just to forget her and worst of it all, I am afraid that I'll forget her. somewhat hoping there's some unknown future for us one day.  1 year I was promised. 1 year!!! I'll carry my Cross proud and strong. God help me.

      oh, another Tuesday. Let's see what I did this morning. hmmm.... woke up real early, went all the way to Raffles place to a Job agency called recruit express.  got a reply from a Ms Shermayne...nice name huh? well, I though she was like the Babe from GMP, but NO I was wrong. she's nice alright, but she was plump. and I'm still grappling with the TERMS of agreement which I had signed at that place. *ALL the Job woes!!*  after that, I was suppose to go out with a friend but ended he had to wait at home as his sister was Going to GIVE birth. yeah, to a baby Girl. Awww.... so he cancelled our meeting today and he's sitting at home waiting for the call from his sister's family.  AH the miracle of Birth. He's gonna be an uncle!!  I also know he's complaining of not being a God-father to Someone. YES! IT's MY FAULT..so STOP BRODDING OVER IT ALREADY!  had the whole Time playing D2 this afternoon. then had this Crazy Idea to Go down to 4 Seasons hotel to go look for a job. the last time I was there, it was like 7 DOLLARS and hour. Good money huh. 1st word from the Security in front. "COME BACK TOMORROW 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM for interview"  Well, that was an adventure, going all the way Down there and get turned BACK!  On the way back, Thoughts of her Flooded my mind again. stuff like the time I had cut off all the things that reminded me of her and send them all back. and that wierd celine dion song playing in my head, titled "it's All comming back to me NOW"  Happy or Sad, life still have to go one day by day. and Screaming in my BLONG about getting a JOB get it done. Geez!  recently found out this girl called sharrone *I think that's her name* who is from the same church as my uncle. mistaken her for someone else, but then again, we seem to be on a good start. as one of my favourite verses say  Hebrews 13:2 " Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it."  lets see is I can inspire and learn from her at the same time.  LASTLY, SOMEONE CAN HELP ME WITH MY BLOG PAGE. I WANT TO ADD PHOTOS AND MUSIC, BULLITIN BOARDS, GUESTBOOK AND LINKS! *can't believe I am screaming my lungs out for this*

      we know Friends, we lose friends. then sometimes Fate twistes them around and you're some how connected back to them yet again.  Life's so unpredictable ain't it.  so back to what happened to me. it's a another Monday, and Can't believe that I survived another weekend.   just went for another interview today, which they obviously wanted me take this test which I had to translate Chinese to English and from English into chinese. GEEZ!!! I have an F9 for chinese and I barely scraped thru my Os with a C6!!! it's a wonder I that I left my PAST behind me 8 years ago until TODAY.  especally translating English to Chinese. well the word "FREEHOLD" used in a property advertisemt, I did this DIRECT translation which became FREE - MIAN3 FEI4...then HOLD-NA3 ZU4...and I ended up translating the word "FREEHOLD" to MIAN3 FEI4 NA3 ZU4!! I guess I gave the interviewer a run for their money! really made the nice lady laugh alot. and there were other stuff too. I think I just blew this job and well. that's ok.  Ah, I called my Job agent today, a really HOT babe. Really good looking girl called Sherine. and Guess what, I recently passed my CV to a friend who was suppose to forward the CV to her friend who is in the HEAD HUNTING business and POOF!! it ended up in Sherine's hands again!! interesting how the world turns huh?  Tomorrow I have attended to another meeting with a nother head hunter to get some more leads to new jobs.  Sometimes I just feel so depressed in life. No job. no money and well no idea my future will be. HAPPY or SAD, I still have to live Day by DAY. one day my Dream will come true. ONWARDS TO SINGAPORE IDOL!!...  if you're reading this, I need help with the song I need to choose for IDOL.*there's a comments button* here's the list: 1.NO MATTER WHAT - boyzone 2.If tomorrow never Comes - Ronan Keating 3.Your Song - Ewan Mc gregor 4.you say it best when you say nothing at all - RONAN KEATING 5.COME WHAT MAY - Ewan mc gregor *again*

Geez. and I really look good on the Pics! I must show people. it's really cool! they took the best 4 for the com cards so that'll be put back in the album later.  AND SPH called me, offered me a temp Job as customer service officer. gotta go interview this MONDAY!. cool cool...  I think I found what Song I'm gonna sing for Next week's Singapore IDOL audition. that is IF I can REMEMBER the toopid lyrics to the Song.  What else happened today. Ahh, brough a very interesting friend to Church today. found out she has some identity problem with her name. calls herself celia, then say her name is chrissie. just like me. Some Call me Simon and Others call me Sherwin. Both of the same boat.  Interestingly she's what I would say a really nice girl, from the looks. won't say pretty, but more to the type called Attractive. chinese would put it as those you probably at first glance won't find attractive but the look has to sink in to appreciate her beauty. *that's to the looks Dept*  reminds me alot of Kelly. but they all Have their dark PAST and generally I find myself time and time again reminding myself that I am ON COMMITEMENT ! geez.and if not for my pocket problem, I sure chop. hahahaha.  thinking over the time she messaged me, I decided that I should be more decisive. DARN, that day, I should have sms back "it's too late already, you REAP what you SOW".  but now,haiz... it's too late already. hmmm.....  it's time to go pray now. all things I placed in God hands.

      Just cam back from this really Good meal at Cafe Cartel. where one of my friends actually odered the wrong dish. and he ended up with a combo meal for 5 person.  we ended up playing some guessing number game and the penalty was to eat the plate of food.  I was walking round PS since 3pm this afternoon! wow. 6 hours at PS. time really flies when you're having fun.  now, sitting back home and probably got me reflecting on what's been happening about my life. Got this Book from a friend "THE PUROSE DRIVEN LIFE" by Rick Warren. Looks like a good book. hope to start reading it soon.  Time and time again. I'm reminded by myself that it'll be Kelly's birthday at the end of this month. wonder why I do this, even I know she has left me. why do I still cling on to the memory. maybe wondering what would I give her if she was still around. Indeed I have been denying my feelings for her still rooted strong within my soul.  It doesn't matter anyway, I've said to Give my this year to God instead of finding myself someone I love. based on a promise I was given at the recent emerge conference. There's much work in the Kingdom to Do.  Tomorrow will be another Day, I'll probably be getting my make over photos and scan them before I can carry on with my other jobs. and I still need to pay for my Com cards. that's like $250.   God, give me a Job. I'm like desperate already.  A wise saying:  James 1:6 - "But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind"  EXPECT RESISTANCE, Pray for Miracles

      Dear Lord,   I thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me. Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness.  Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You. Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things.  Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over. Let me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.  And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example -to slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to do Your will.  Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that are lost and can't find their way. I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who don't know You intimately. I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I believe.  I believe that God changes people and God changes things. I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that they are out of debt and all their needs are met.  I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.  This is my prayer.In Jesus' Name, Amen.

      Today, although eventful but very tiring day for a person like me.  Nothing much happened at work, other than just after I have left office, I found out that I had left my medicine on the Desk and I can’t get it until Monday.  Again, it is our 2nd lesson in Grooming. The lesson which will prep me up for modeling with this modeling company I just signed up with. I guess part of the lesson was just knocking us around telling our flaws in our color matching. Maybe I’m just so tired that I just feel like being hostile to the people there.  More interestingly, being knocked around reminded me of this passage in the bible.   “And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.”&nbsp;  2 Timothy 2:24.  It reminded me of the 4 wells in Genesis 26, the 4 wells which ISAAC had made:   Esek (strife); Sitnah (hatred); Rehoboth (room for all); and Shebah (oath).  &nbsp; Isaac, the Lord's servant, meekly journeyed farther back into the valley rather than quarrel with the herdsmen. He would not pay evil with evil or insult with insult (1 Peter 3:9).  This may be one of the most difficult lessons we have to learn in life.  Since we are human, we probably have drunk from all these wells. Few of us would brag that we have never argued over something or some person in our life. And we have either hated or been hated at some time. Human nature afflicts us all. Finally, as we grow into grace, we come to recognize that there is room for us all, if we have not died at Esek or Sitnah. God has made a very large well, with enough water for a thirsty world in need of the Water of Life. Unfortunately, it takes years to find our Rehoboth, our well of love and mercy, and Shebah, our well of redemption.   As we travel through life we have and will yet come across all these wells. It requires constant patience and perseverance to get beyond the wells of competition and hostility and on to the wells of growth and gratitude. We drink deeply of the Lord's provisions and promises as we search and find His refreshing waters of confidence and rest. We dare not drown at the Eseks and Sitnahs of our lives.   Isaac gave and forgave in this splendid passage; he practiced "in spite of" instead of "in spite." May we too learn to strive not but to allow God to take care of any evil that enters our life.   "All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation."  2 Corinthians 5:18.

      A man once said that “life is a stage, that everyone must play its part”  &nbsp;  It’s a another day at work, this time, I am down with the flu, spent the past two days just wallowing in my sickness. Today it’s back to work, and still feeling the effects of the cough syrup taken this morning.  &nbsp;  Sometimes I wonder did I take an overdose of&nbsp; it, as I feel this numb feeling at the end of my fingertips.  &nbsp;  Moving on from the JAZZ bug, I think I seem to be resting in the comfort of OPERA. A blind singer, ADREA BOCELLI is the name. with Songs like the prayer, and Con Te Partiro, who won’t fall in love with that voice.  &nbsp;  I feel so tired, drowsy from the Medicine and still up to write this Blog.  &nbsp;  Nothing much happening, other than I just started my grooming course with guiding stars and on my way hopefully to take up a job as a part time model. Homework for Tomorrow, is to dress up in your best looking outfit, and bring another to the place. And also do like 20 poses in a 30 seconds. I guess it aren’t difficult for me. But it’s modeling. since I’ve lost weight, then why not?? Right?  &nbsp;  Sometimes I feel that my life is like a drama, with being torn becoming a Radio DJ, model, Marketer. To even a shot at stardom in Singapore IDOL. All happening in a short span a few months.  &nbsp;  Other good news include that 28th July, I have been roped into being choir member church. Finally!! A another shot in working in God’s Church. Should be expecting it all to go well. That’s like next Wednesday. An still have no idea what songs to Sing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  AS for all the above, they are all the fruits what I will reap in due time. BUT !! ARGH!!!  I need to stretch my dollar for this time. I need to Toil the soil, sweat and bleed. And also eating instant noodles for lunch once again.  &nbsp;  But for now:  &nbsp;   “therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.”  &nbsp;JOB 7:11  &nbsp;  Lastly, a really big Thank you for Adrian, for showing me the road to a better life. To correct the small character flaws, those wrong mindsets which were instilled in me from the experience of life.  &nbsp;  ONWARD to Embrace the Lovely lessons and classroom which is called LIFE.      “to Shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of PEACE” &nbsp; Luke 1:79

      Coming in early to work this morning, gave me a chance to sit alone and think about God, people and my life once again.  &nbsp;  To reflect on the events in my life. That long road we all must trek, dusty and rocky. Straight and winding. The past hurts and past success, and the present road that lies fork. On the road of career, I’m dabbling with a changing job. And on the road of love,&nbsp; I dabble with the decision of loving or leaving, choosing experience over innocents. Wisdom over foolishness, Where time becomes an adversary, and age becomes a rising concern. All healthy instincts for it, all logic against it….  &nbsp;  Opening the word, came to a chapter about 2 men on the road to Emmaus.  &nbsp;   "...Jesus himself came up and walked along with them." Luke 24:15   &nbsp;  No one but God knows who these two men were. One wasn't even accorded the distinction of a name. But Jesus quietly entered into their discouraged lives and conversation and comforted them.  &nbsp;   "They asked each other, `Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"  Luke 24:32.  &nbsp;  Our human puzzles are not solved by reason or by what seem to be rational human theories, but by what God tells us. Life can be enormously unreasonable. Every person who has any sensibilities at all has cried out a "Why?" to some unwarranted (or so it seems) work or word. When it happens, our beloved Jesus walks on our Emmaus road with us and reasons with us.  &nbsp;  Sometimes, familiarity breeds complacency.  &nbsp;   “For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief”  Ecclesiastes 1:18  &nbsp;  To my road, I know it forks with many turns and winding, We live by faith. Not by sight, Faith Strengthen by the word.  &nbsp;   “Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working or planning nor knowledge nor wisdom” &nbsp; Ecclesiastes 9:10

      Lately been really busy working, and spending time with a certain someone. Hadn’t time to actually sit down and write a little of my thoughts.  More interesting events happening, include my trip to the head office of MTV Asia. And probably a run in with a huge Centipede while bathing. *don’t worry, I’m fine…*  Sometimes I wonder, if I’m lucky….. This present job that I am taking pays me to play Diablo 2 all day. Just cause there’s like no work coming in. Bad side is that I don’t learn anything, no opportunity for expansion.  Other interesting stuff include that I’ll be meeting my future boss today. *Keeping fingers crossed*  Sometimes when unsure about things in life, I usually ask for a sign, weird may it be. Something interesting, out of the ordinary…yet afraid of some of the answers which might resulted.   Problems always abound in life. But HEY! That is life anyway.   "Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above."   ISAIAH 7:11  I pray everyday for a Sign from above, for my Job, My spiritual life, my love life and even the people whom I am suppose to come in contact with.  Tuesday will be the day I start my grooming course. Hope this thing pulls through, then  I can probably be working for a modeling agency.  With a diminishing pocket book, I pray for God’s providence too. Although I started my job, even when you plant seeds, You still have to wait for the seeds to grow before you can HARVEST.  Just as I flipped open my bible, my hand comes to a certain verse, and I guess I’ll end my Entry today with this. Be inspired   “Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.”   1 PETER 5:6-7

      It's another boring DAy at work, having just enough tie to crap around here.  This is gonna be one of those non inspirational Blog entries I'm gonna put.  Adrian's Studying for his exams coming up. next week, and he's like way way stress. I guess that’s what I am, just being there for him, and well take is mind off all the problems associated with something we all Call Life.  AS you start going bonkers over what or who ADRIAN is, *thanx for all your E-mails* Here's a Run down:  A – Addictively D – Desirable R – Really I – Innocent A – Aphrodisiacal N – Nymph  I actually am going for a new Job interview. One Adrian introduced to me. And I have to spend money to take taxi all the way to East coast.   Money is so important…I’m really getting poor!   “A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, But money is the answer to Everything”   Ecclesiastes 10:19

      1 Kings 18:16–46  Since I've started work, it's been really busy to actually spend time Doing entries for my Blog.   Since today is a Saturday and I‘ll probably meet Adrian this evening for dinner,  it gives me a chance to actually log down what I  has been happening in my life for the past few days.  Today, I am writing into this entry with a heavy heart of giving to missions and hopefully a new job.   Knowing church is on this whole program on giving towards the missions fund. Sometimes you want to Give. Yet thinking and looking at your current situation, you ask God about how much can you give. Difficult as it is, I still have to lean on God for providence.  Yesterday, encouraged by the word for the season, although I had written a small amount  up for the missions, however I changed it to a larger amount later as I felt the tugging of the spirit.   “But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or  sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing. "   1 Chronicles 21:24  I reached into my wallet, pulled out the stack of dollar bills. And put them into the envelope, with the heavy heart of not knowing how will I be able to support myself thru till my 1st pay day next month.  It was the same feeling I had when I gave to the Building Fund last year.    “Those who  sow in tears  will reap with songs of joy”  Psalm 126:5  I was like the only one streaming in tears that day at church. I remembered the story of the old woman whom Jesus watched while she gave her offering. And later was praised for she had given more than the rest in the temple that day, even if it was only 2 copper coins.  Somehow, I am happy that I may not be in any debts or don’t owe people money. Problems will come, money problem will always come.  To all who are contributing to the missions fund. Stay strong in Faith, one day your joy will come.   “sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything”  2 Corinthians 6:10

      Again I find myself sitting at work with actually very little to do, probably what you would call as STASIS.  It's Good time to actually sit back, relax and Start today's reflection.  Lots of things have been happening. Exactly 1 month after the emerge conference, I have been seeing the most amazing Guy in my life at this point. He's Adrian. maybe he's older than me, but it feels different when I'm around him.  Sometimes you wonder did God say 1 month ... and yourself shouting 1 year? anyway, I have yet to wait as time can only tell.  He is helping me find a new job in wich will suite and equip me with the knoledge and skills to help me in the working world.  He's come a long way, that's what I've known, and one can only wonder at how much this person has to offer?  Gratitude as it may be, I find myself time and time again, not to take him for granted. Treasure him for who he is in my life.  I just sent him my "beefed" up resume, of which he did a little changes here and there. To my surprise, it looked more pleaseable to the eyes and very presenable.  It'll surely increase my job chances in the field.  Many questions seem to Surround the air between adrian and me.  During seed time and harvest, For both of us, here is my inspiration VERSE.   "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, But God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow"   1 Corinthians 3:6-7  God love all of us. even when we are cracked in some way

      Yesterday I Adrian for dinner, went over his office and we ate had Kway chap in Yishun. Interestingly, I have just found a new place that served good Food in Yishun.  the rest of the evening we spent talking and well, he helped me beef up my CV to a more eye catching one, rather than the one I had now.  that day, he e-mailed me his CV and then from the way he wrote it, it was really like a someone who was able to catch the attention of employers. the expression that I could say was that it Blew me away.  This time, I really stood there in Awe. Lost for words, totally impressed.  I guess that's what you get from someone who has been working for some time.  on my way home, What made him so willing to help me, was that for the past few days that I had been with him, I had actually sown into him the things I'velearnt over the past 2 years. the different aspects of being in and out of relationships. to those stories which are aimed to encourage, inspire and build character.   "while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."  2cor 4:18  Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.  and on a lighter note, he had actually paid for dinner too. sometimes it's when you run out of money, that's when you actually know who your true friends are.  Are they the ones who would argue with you to pay up a few dollars over a game of pool. when you've been fetching them around? or would they quarrel with you over the time that you do not have money?  Or would they actually take time out to share their lives, feed and care for you?    "for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me."  Matthew 25:35-36  Indeed, Rich people Surround themselves with walls for protection, but poor people have friends who protect and love them.  To the people who have helped me during these times. Jo, Robin, Pearl, Brandon, Nigel, Shannon and a very lovely Adrian.  AS EVERYONE REMEMBER JOHN 3:16.....PEOPLE SELDOME REMEMBER 1 JOHN 3:16   "This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers."  1 JOHN 3:16

      Oh my, it's like so many things happen today. Just can squeeze enough time to post this entry. all cropped up with church, Prayer meetings and even bible studies next week! Just a few days ago, I met this person online. was chatting with her, and I met her yesterday.  the surprising thing was that he is the MARKETING MANAGER for MTV ASIA! this is like so Cool, I made a pack with him that he'll introduce me a place to work in MTV! YES!...  GOD IS GOOD....  just must remember to mail him my CV before Monday.  Last few nights was spent on the phone with this person. Through it all, made me learnt that  being honest can be one of the most diffcuilt task to accomplish. you will have to  care enough to lovingly speak the truth, even when you would rather gloss over a problem or ignore the issue.  I've seen too many superficial relationship around me, eveyone knows about the problem, but no one tlks about it openly. creating a sick environment where gossip thrives.  Often we know What needs to be said to someone but our fears prevent us from saying anything.  Often we are to,  "...Speak the truth in Love...."  Ephesians 4:15  Surprising, Felloship in marriage or friendship depends much on frankness. In fact, may mines, the tunnel of conflict is the passageway to intimacy in any relationship.  Unless you care enough to confront and resolvethe underlying barriers, you will probably never grow close to each other. When conflict is handeled correctly, we grow closer to each other by facing and resolving differences.   "He who rebukes a man will in the end gain more favour than he who has a flattering tongue" PROVERBS 28:23  I sometimes open up myself to others, is just fo the fact to give up our  self-centeredness  and  independence  in order to become  INTERDEPENDENT . my conclusion, the benefits of sharing life together for outweigh the costs.

      today's Log entry should be a short one as I'll be starting work tomorrow and I need some sleep.  Just came back from watching a very very good movie. and you've guessed it. SPIDERMAN 2.  During one part of the movie. when Aunt May talked about being heros, sacrifice and well, it ended with the 3 words I missed so much "I love you".  This made me realized that :  Even heros struggles with  money, pride and relationships.  cause they are human too. the heros in my life, are not the ones like Spiderman but the ones whom have shared their lives with me. which I use their experience to encourage other people that I talk to. *U know who you are*  Time, is a great revealer. and in love, it unmask it to reveal what's underneath the heart.  The importance of things can be measured by how much time we are willing to invest in them. The more time you give to somthing, the more you reveal its importace and value to you. If you want to know a person't priorities, just look at how they use their time.  Time, I guess is my most precious gift. that cause everyone has only a SET ammount of time. We can make more money, But you can't make more time. when we give someone our time, we are giving them a portion of our lives that we'll never get it back. My time is My life. That's why my greatest gift to someone in My time.  You know, I think the BEST way to Spell LOVE is "T-I-M-E".  the essence of Love is not what we think or do or provide for others, but how much we give of OURSELVES.  If God were to ask me:   How will you explain those times when projects or things were more important to you than people?  Who do you need to start spending more time with?  What do you need to cut out of your schedule to make that possible?  What sacrfice do YOU need to make?   How will I answer HIM.......????......   The best use of life is LOVE. The Best expression of Live is TIME. The best time to love is NOW.    "THE ENTIRE LAW IS SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE COMMAND: *LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF*" GALATIANS 5:14

      9th August, my second TV debut. Yes I was on Singapore idol TV how, but only in the back. At the last part, when they were rolling the credits, they showed the audition room which I was in, and I, was the first one that stood up in the BACK row!  I guess that was my 3 sec of fame. I hope in the coming episodes, they would actually feature me. Generally the way TV portrayed the competition was nowhere near how it was like that day.  Later after the debut episode, I had dinner with Adrian, and had a good talk about the media industry. On how the layman sees movie stars as glamorous, outstanding, and very much attention seeking. His views on the whole idea is that, they are generally puppets who are only controlled by the producer and director on that day. Actors, models, radio DJs, Singers alike. All controlled by a back person. What songs to play, what things go through the air. For Radio, person who probably will be in control is our very own Florence Lian. The personalities are just puppets, trying to make a living. I guess that’s why one of our lecturer during the radio academy said “I rather be a normal radio DJ than a radio personality” – exploitation and manipulation. And really being “all about the money”  If anything sells, the media will pry into you. Goes the same for celebrities like Britney Spears, Mavis Hee, Kit chan, Princess Diana and even our very own Ho Yeow Sun. If anything sells, Britney’s porn flicks, debates on Mavis and Kit’s schooling background, the death of a princess and the disconnecting logic of a pastor turned singer or even a red dress. These are selling points which the media can capitalize on, just because they have become a public figure. You can’t just say what you like or do what you like. You may even have to do things which oppose what your beliefs system, so you either do it or break it. If you’re “labeled”, given Singapore’s media industry being small, you’ll be out of the job in no time.  Then comes the question of my very own church. The controversy on the way the church is run, about the hype produce during service. Getting people emotionally charged to a point they abandon logic. Basic psychology, logic and feeling do not go together. As I have mention in my pervious blogs before about Kelly. Logic steps in, feeling walk out. FEELING step in, Logic goes out the door.  Questions like, are we drawing the masses of people to our church not out of having a heart for God, but more like concerts, lights or even to rub shoulders with an international pop singer.  Having heard and read articles of why people get international stars to market a certain product, is because these people will have a certain pool of people that will say, “hey she wears this, I should wear it too” or “he does this so I should be doing this too”  “ 12 Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. 13 And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves.'  " Matthew 21:12 & 13  I think that’s why we have a habit of praying for God to bring People that will eventually become whole hearted and rooted in the word of God. Not half – hearted ones which will be eager to switch sides once the hype dies down.  In all these, I too remember this.  “ holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict .” Titus 1:9  I pray for answers to some of these questions.

      Thursdays and Fridays Spells an early to work and Smell of my Bachelor of Economics Majoring in Marketing class.  A new chapter in my life begins, meeting of new people and get to work on my networking skills. Few interesting people I met are my classmate of which is in the same church as me. Met this Really really chatty girl. It’s just superb.  Updates on work, it’s still very free here, nothing’s on and nothing’s up and running. Really good place to slack and not do work. Good thing is that,  am able to do my own research. from my marketing research to actually reading up on my psychology.  Few more days till pay day, where I an finally breathe a little more easy. With some Cash in the bank, and I won’t be so Salty/Giam/Stingy with enjoying.  Thank God for his providence with the people who have been standing thru with me. A very big thanks to Adrian. A girl called Christine, for helping me reserve seats in Church.  On ministry side, I just audition for the position of being a choir member. To share stage with pastor. Talk about Being taken from Glory to Glory. Then again, I’m awaiting for results of the audition.  On the female side, *yes, ALL you guys out there wanna know this* been keeping in touch with some old primary school friends whom I have not seen in like 12 years!! Just met up with one of them who work as a temp staff at HBO. Went to this Gala premier of “SEX and the CITY” saw huge celebrities like steph song, and even our “Brainiest” host Cheryl FOX. Totally beautiful girls. *yeah guys, envy me!!!*  Ok, back to my friend, she looks really like this girl from SPIN, Melody Chen. but only with a bit more meat. Had quite a nice chat with her.
