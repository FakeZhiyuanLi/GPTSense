      This is a test post.  Yes, it is. Really.  Okay, I really created this account so I could add entries to another blog.   I might add the link if you play nicely.   EDIT: That last entry was to stall for time. The link for the "team blog" (or whatever the hell it's called) that I'm posting in (at the insistence of a couple of friends) can be found at http://staffofra.blogspot.com/  Yay.

      Outlaw Golf 2 is  urlLink online  via Xbox Live.  All of you with an Xbox better be on Live when this thing drops so I can birdie your asses.  Anyone else think  urlLink this  sounds less than exciting?  Doctors are fine and all, even actor doctors, but really, is that really a fantasy most people want to live out in a game?  There was a game from years back related to surgery, and all I remember people doing is carving up the patient in creative patterns.  Will this be any different?  Do I want it to be?  I know, it's probably bad form to want something like that what with all the scandals about, but still...  I couldn't find a decent preview in the two seconds I looked for one, so you all will have to do with the corporate  urlLink site .  If you like either The Sims or Civilization, I think you might like this one quite a bit.  Holy God  urlLink damn .  It must be good to be crazy ass rich.  Well, that's all for now...

      To all the nerds in the audience.  I've finally broken down and bought a massively multiplayer online role playing game and the game that broke me was City of Heroes.  Every review I've read lead me to believe that it's different than other games of this nature.  Most games like this didn't really draw me in because most accounts said that you ended up spending a lot of your gaming time in down time, which basically means you just sit around because you're healing or something.  So far, this game is action-rific, which is how a super hero game should be.  The other deterant has been cost.  Normally they're $50 at retail, then $15 a month, though you almost always get the first month free.  Anyway, the game is $40 at Electronics Boutique, for a little while anyways.  I know it's only ten bucks off, but I see it as getting the game and two months for $50.  If I don't know after two months if I really want to keep playing, that's probably a good sign that I should cancel the account.  Anyway, so far it's fun and all you nerds out there should play, at least for these two months when I'm playing.  I forget what server I'm on, but I'll post it later...

      So I was vaguely aware that this movie was getting made, but my friend Drew  urlLink says  that Eddie Izzard is going to be in it.  The first one was fun and I can't imagine the second not being fun with him in it.  You'll  have to scroll down to the story since I don't know how to link to specific parts of web pages yet.  Also, you should all read Drews blog regularly since it's great.

      Well,  urlLink damn , that's one serious beat down.

My money says either of these teams will beat whomever comes out of the West.

      Well, given how much I read their stuff, you guys should get used to me stealing stuff from  urlLink Pandagon .  Anyway, they have a story about various conservative pundits, George Will and others, that have begun to openly criticize Bush's policies.  Most of these guys, a year or two ago, would have stretched logic and facts to sometime preposterous, some times flat out fabrication, levels in order to justify some crazy idea of gaff by administration officials.    Needless to say, this sort of breakdown in the machinery of the Republican Press' version of Robosaurus couldn't come at a worse time for El Presidente.  This leads me to a couple of questions of my own.   urlLink Salon  has an article about this mechanism and its history, but here's the basic rundown:  Thirty years ago the Republicans decided to invest in the future.  They founded a bunch of think tanks and unified thier party in a way that allowed them to some crushing victories both politically and culturally in the nineties and through today (see: at one point a significant portion of Americans believed that not only had we found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but thought that Saddam used them against US troops during combat).  The Democrats, alternatively, have spent the last decade, at least, fragmented.  The best example is the 2000 election where you had the economically concervative Clintonian wing backing Gore and the Dave Mathews/Drum Circle wing backing Nader.  Conversely, this year as heated as the Democratic primary got, the rhetoric nearly always came down to who would beat Bush the best.    What I can only hope is that what we're experiencing now is a swing back to the left.  Being the party in power requires a very careful balancing of interests to keep a coalition majority in place to keep you in office and it looks like Bush's coalition might be crumbling.  What really brought this to the fore in my mind was John McCain's appearance on the Daily Show tonight.  Granted, he's never been afraid of going against the party grain, but he did NOT sound like a man trying to get people to vote for Bush this fall.  Given some of the rumors being thrown around on the internet, could we see a coalition of Democrats AND Republicans forming to oust Bush?  Is there, as has been hinted at, a possibility of a Kerry/McCain ticket this fall?  Bush is one tricky sonofabitch when it comes to elections and I don't think we've seen anywhere near his best stuff yet this year, but the tide  seems to be turning, and the rip tide might just tow Bush and Co. out to sea with it, never to be seen again...

      HSR is dead, long live HSR!  Well, the short-lived prior version of this blog was on some really crappy software, so had to move on to this deluxe apartment in the e-sky.  Can't really blame it much, given that it was really meant to be for online diaries and not really blogs.    So anyhow, this one looks to my novice eyes like it has plenty of features to keep me going for a while, so let's hope for the best.  Most of all, it's much prettier than the last one, so it looks like my same old tired ideas just got a fancy new suit to dress up in.  Enough of this, let's get to bloggin y'all!

       urlLink Wow , as far as I can tell from the blogs I read, I'm one of the first people to write about this which I'll gladly chalk up to my fancy Eastern time zone.    By this point many people have commented on the fact that the handover isn't complete in any sense of the word and is more likely than not just a way for Bush to say he handed over sovereignty to Iraq when people grill him on it as we get closer to November.  It seems to me that if people were worried that the fact that the interim governing council can't make a lot of real choices (they're not allowed to repeal some of the laws the US, I mean, Coalition forces made, etc.), this hastily thrown together handoff isn't going to make the new government seem any more solid.  It just looks like the US was expecting some kind of attack and wanted to get the Hell out of the country ASAP.  Who knows, maybe Paul Bremmer just wanted to be back in the states for Spiderman 2 on Wednesday instead of doing boring political ceremonies.  I don't know, I'm sure I'll have more to say about this in the coming days.

       urlLink This  type of hypocrisy is exactly what pisses me off about the neocons.  If a Democrat had told a Republican to "fuck off" in the Senate, in session or out, the Republicans and their pundit lap dogs would be all over it calling for a formal appology.  If Dick Cheney does it though, it's just tensions running high in an election year.   I actually don't care that much about the actual swearing at all really.  It just annoyes me that the Republicans always try to claim the moral high ground, especially when Kerry lets the sailor talk out, but they conveniently forget moments like this and when GW called a reporter an asshole.

      So the Bush campaign  urlLink released  a web video ad which used clips from rejected MoveOn.org commercial submissions which compared Bush to Hitler and claimed that this was part of Kerry's "Coalition of the Wide-Eyed".  Kerry's campaign, understandably pissed at this unfair and dishonest link being made.    The thing that pisses me off most about this is the  urlLink response  from the Bushies.  Seriously, as if either party has the monopoly on crazy things being said by the fringes of their side of the political spectrum.  Really, so I need to bring Pat Buchanan into this debate?

      Well,  urlLink looks  like Farenheit 9/11 is doing ok at the box office.  At this pace, somewhere between 2.4 and 3 million people will see this movie over the weekend.  Assuming the movie has decent staying power, it won't take long for more people to see it than voted in the last election.  Might not happen, but it'll sure be interesting.  I know nowhere nearly all of the people seeing this movie will vote Kerry, but it can't hurt.  Oh, and Disney, it turns out people ARE interested in political movies in an election year.  Who woulda guessed it?

      Zell Miller, a Democrat, is  urlLink speaking  at the GOP Convention and in endorsing Bush for President.

      Man, I wish we could dig up Roosevelt's bones and make him some kind of mega cyborg president.  These are about the best ideas ever:   The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation;  The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;  The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;  The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;  The right of every family to a decent home;  The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;  The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;  The right to a good education.   Where are our politicians like this?  They're called Ralph Nader, but Kerry will have to do I suppose.

      So Todd Bertuzzi has been  urlLink charged  with assault for the bash job he did on Steve Moore last season.  While I think we all know he's not going to get the 10 year possible maximum, nor do I think he should.  In fact I think it's likely he won't go to jail at all and I'm ok with that too.  Hockey's a tough sport and shit happens.  Granted, Bertuzzi went way over the line of acceptable behavior, but I don't think it warrants jail time.  Still, it's nice to see the league, and the courts, taking this seriously.  Hockey should be physical, but hockey is not ABOUT fighting and random violence.

       urlLink NYT :   Insurgents staged what appeared to be coordinated assaults in cities across central and northern Iraq today, overrunning police stations, ambushing American patrols and driving car bombs right up to government buildings.      A spokesman for the Iraqi Health Ministry, which tracks Iraqi casualties nationwide, said today's death toll was 69 Iraqis dead and 276 injured, with 44 killed in Mosul alone. The spokesman said he expected the death toll to climb.     In the early afternoon, pillars of smoke curled up above the skyline. Helicopters swooped through the sky. Columns of vehicles carrying American soldiers rolled along the roadways leading to the downtown area, where three buildings were reduced to rubble by 500-pound bombs dropped from American aircraft.   And three American soldiers died as well along with many more injured.  Six days and counting until the country is supposed to be ready for handover...yeah right.

      So the newest  urlLink batch  of Xbox 2 specs may indeed be real, or at least close to real.

      Well, it  urlLink appears  that the spread of AIDs is NOT best served by completely ignoring it!  I'm sure glad I have the Bush Administration to teach me all these science facts that I learned in 9th grade.  It's nice to know that, if nothing else, G.W. is learning neat new things, like junior high health science, from his presidency.  And in  urlLink other  news, it turns out that nuclear weapons in North Korea don't seem to go away if we just stop talking to them and pout.

      So the Supreme Court ruled today that the government doesn't have to release information about Dick Cheney's secret energy task force, though it did send the case back to the lower courts to decide if there were other ways to get the info.  While this case will still putter along, chances are it is likely out of the way for the election in November.  For those keeping tabs, Justice Scalia did not recuse himself from this case despite the obvious potential conflict of interest created by the duck hunting trip he went on with the Vice President and he indeed came down on the side of the Vice President's side.    This case was filed under the Federal Advisory Comittee Act of 1972, which requires comittees to operate in the open unless all the members are government officials, but there is a much more promising case still coming down the pipe filed under the Freedom of Information act, so let's cross our fingers for that one.

       urlLink Club for Growth  has a moronic video (it's the first one) that doesn't say a true thing in it.   urlLink Partisan Jab  shows us what a John Ashcroft summer blockbuster would look like.  I guess I kind of gave away the answer huh? For those interested in my objections to the Club for Growth ad: It mentions nothing of what GW was doing in 1971, they don't seem to comprehend that John Kerry was saying we can't fight Communism like we did in Vietnam and he was right, and there are obvious problems about their portrayal of the fall of the Soviet Union.

      So when Kerry  urlLink said  that Bush had a pathetic record on science, the Bushies, of course, deny it like crazy.  Well it turns out that, as ever, it's really half a truth if you accept their crazy interpretation.  See, the research and development budget  urlLink has gone up  quite a bit, just mostly for bombs and other military stuff and not so much for the science.  God, why can't these guys ever be straight with us?  Well, I guess if I were wrong all the time I'd try to cover my ass too.

      David Brooks thinks Kerry doesn't like God enough, or at least he doesn't show it.  Maybe we should all chip in and get him a WWJD t-shirt, or at least a bracelet.  For some odd reason Brooks doesn't even mention all the recent hullabaloo about whether or not John Kerry should be allowed to take communion because he doesn't believe in everything the Catholic Church believes.  I'd also like to point out that if, as David Brooks tells us, Americans "don't like to see their politicians meddling with religion in any way" W's attempts to goad the Pope what is essentially an endorsement should blow up in his face as spectacularly as his WMD obsession.  Edit: So it  urlLink turns out  that Brooks' study is a big pile of crap.  It seems that the study identified anyone that had strong feelings against "fundamentalists" as a "secularist".  Needless to say, there are lots of people, especially on the democratic side of the isle, that dislike fundamentalists like a Falwell or an Ashcroft but would hardly consider themselves secularist.  While I'm hardly the most religious person in the world, I'm am greatful that there are Democrats out there trying to reclaim religion and morality from the Republicans.

      Though I get pissed off a lot at the pundits endlessly towing the Team Bush line, I do sometimes chuckle to myself at things like  urlLink this  (via the ever wonderful  urlLink Pandagon ).  I just wish I could have been a fly on the wall when these guys decided that they had spent enough months saying "Just wait, we'll find WMDs soon enough, then you'll see that our mission to disarm Saddam was justified" and decided to move on to the next item on their "Defend Bush's Iraq Plan Checklist".  I imagine there was an audible click and some sort of whirring sound their brains prepared the next tenuous excuse for the mess we're in.

       urlLink Here  is the coolest map in the world (Thanks  urlLink TMW ), which just reminds us that having a four or five point spread in some polls doesn't mean a thing.  You've got to take the presidency state by state, though really having states like NY and CA pretty solid definitely makes the sure loss in Texas lose a bit of its sting.  This sure makes it clear why swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida get so much attention.  Edit: Speaking of cool maps, I've known about  urlLink this  one for several weeks now from several sources but kept forgetting to post it.  From what I understand they update it regularly, so all of you people out there reading this blog (all none of you) should check it frequently between now and election day.

      So the  urlLink word  is that Microsoft has decided not to support backwards compatibility for Xbox 2 and the nerds have come out like villagers to their Frankenstein's Monster.  For those that don't know, backwards compatibility means that you could mosey your way down to your local game store, buy a shiny new Xbox 2 (as of now planned to hit in the fall of 2005) along with games designed to play on both the Xbox 2 as well as the Xbox 1 and play them all on one machine.    So yeah, this is a pretty cool feature, but in the scheme of things this isn't that big of a deal.  Firstly, as the article says, only around 10% of people are even interested in this feature.  I would actually wager that most of those 10% represent a sigificant portion of people that buy the system at launch, but I'd also wager that even these 10% mostly stop using the feature within a year.  My solution to the raging nerd horde is simple.  Microsoft should redesign the Xbox 1 into a smaller, sleeker package, as Sony did with the PSone, and sell the thing for $100 or so at the Xbox 2 lauch and then reduce the price again in a year or two.  Just my late night rambling thoughts as I read message boards filled with nerds acting tough.

      Sweet Jesus John Stewart just gave Steven Hayes of the Weekly Standard's ass in the most increadible way.  Stewart is pretty moderate generally and he usually is pretty even handed with his guests, but he really brought the bitch slap when Hayes tried to make the case for the Iraq/Saddam.  The truth is, as Stewart pointed out, the doctrine put into action in Iraq is not only completely unusable on any sort of wide spread, global manner but even using it in Iraq has been anything but a successful way to deal with the people we really should be focusing, terrorist cells actively planning terror attacks.

      So I saw Chronicles of Riddick this last weekend and thought you all wanted to know what it was like.  Firstly and most simply stated: Riddick is a lot better than you think it is.  Unless, of course, you think it's going to be the Second Coming.  For anyone that missed  urlLink Pitch Black , well, you should rent it before you see Chronicles.  Though it's not necessary to the story, it adds a lot of details that make it more interesting as does the recently released Xbox game  urlLink Escape From Butcher Bay .    But barring some preparation, you lazy ass you, here's a run down:  Riddick is a mass murderer.  In fact, he's one of the worst murderers ever and has escaped from at least a couple of the most secure prisons in the universe.  In Pitch Black he did manage to summon enough emotion to save a couple people, but it seems he ditched them soon thereafter.  When we find Riddick at the start of this film he's being stalked by bounty hunters that are sort of like Boba Fett, but if Boba Fett had been down on his luck and had to sell all of his cool along with his plasma to buy drugs.  Several killings later, we find out that there is a war like race called the Necromongers that is planet hopping on its way to the afterlife killing as they go.  This is where Riddick becomes both exactly what it is and yet slightly more.  The fight against the Necromongers is your classic one-man-takes-on-an-army type story that you see in a lot of summer sci-fi action flicks, but there are bits that makes this a more interesting story than it could have been.  The Necromongers worship death, as their name might imply, and evil, violence and death become central themes in the movie.  Additionally, there are reletively few "good" characters and those that there are are given pretty marginal roles.  Though this dynamic is announced far too blatantly, and with mediocre at best writing, in a Dame Judy Dench naration, I still walked out of the theater thinking about the characters far more than I expected to.  I paid a $6 matinee ticket to see Riddick and was satisfied.  If you're looking for a summer action flick, you could sure do worse than this.

      Whatever you think about  urlLink this  case, involving the 'under God' clause of the pledge of allegience, this is a pretty weak ending.  Realistically, the Supreme Court usually waits until they get the 'perfect case' to make a binding precedent so that it's less likely to be overruled later.  That being the case, this is the right outcome, it's just sort of a letdown, though not nearly as big a letdown as having the case lose on the merits, which it looks like it probably would have had it made it past this procedural issue.  For those interested, here's some info on the origins of the pledge and what I would like it to be: "The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by Baptist minister and educator Francis Bellamy, who made no reference to religion in his version. It was originally worded: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." It quickly became a part of public school programs."

      I heard excited rumoring that a graphic novel called  Watchmen  was going to be made into a  urlLink movie  and that it would be directed by Darren Aronofsky, who directed  Requiem For a Dream , and that the screenplay was being written by David Hayter, who wrote both Xmen movies.  My interest was piqued.  I decided to find out what the hell this book was and everywhere I looked people talked about this thing like it was the second coming.  One guy called it the comic book world's  War and Peace .  I know as well as anyone that geeks aren't afraid of a little hyperbole, but I picked it up anyway.  Here's my review: Read it now.  Whether you're a comic fan or have never picked up a comic book in your life.  Go find this thing and read it.  This is easily the best comic I've ever read, but it's also become the best work of fiction I've read in a while.  On top of being just a damn good piece of work, it's eerily poignient even though it's from the mid-eighties.  I never thought comics could be like this.

      Kerry did his  urlLink speechifying  last night, but I missed it.  How could I miss it you ask?  I was READING of all things!  Anyway, I caught it online, and if you missed it you should too.  I must say that the Convention was, for me, increadibly effective.  Between speakers like Clinton, Obama, Sharpton, Edwards, and now Kerry, I feel like I'm no longer voting against Bush.  I'm voting FOR Kerry/Edwards.  Yeah, I'm still way further left than they are and I'm bound to disagree with their adminstration on a lot of issues, but that's fine.  My gripe with the Democrats in 2000 is that I hardly agreed with ANYTHING Gore ran on.  Anyway, I think the party's pretty jazzed right about now.  After we get that Republican Convention nonsense out of the way it's on to the debates!

      I don't know why I didn't think of  urlLink this  sooner, but looking at the latest Official Xbox Magazine it looks like the August 24 date which figures so prominently in this viral marketing campaign could be referring to a Halo 2 demo coming out next month.  The weekly updates that Bungie has been releasing have been getting increasingly boring, with most of them referring to increasingly minor bug fixes, which says to me that they might be spending their time making a demo.  It's all just speculation, but wouldn't it be an awfully big coincidence for one date to crop up twice in the Xbox world?

       urlLink This  is mega cool both as a form of advertising and for new video game news.  You should all read the story because it's pretty cool, but the very very short version is this: At the end of the theatrical trailer for Halo 2 which started showing a week or so ago, the www.xbox.com underneath the Xbox logo changes for a fraction of a second to www.ilovebees.com.  The article breaks the site, and its evolution, down better, but it looks now like www.ilovebees.com is what is called viral marketing.    This is exactly the kind of advertising I want to see in the future.  Well, no.  I want to see NO advertising in the future, but ads are a fact of the world we live in, so they might as well be entertaining.  Like the multi-part ads from the mid-90s (where a story was broken up into a series of ads), this type of advertising makes the ad itself a form of entertainment as well as a means of disseminating information about whatever product it's hawking.      And I love Halo 2 and if it loved me back I would have its babies if man/video game mating technology were more developed.   But no, G.W. cut back on funding for that to!  Is there no science he likes?!

      The lesson from this appearance is that Mike just isn't very good in a live debate and should, I humbley submit, probably have had me there to prepare him notecards. He let the debate spend WAY too long on whether Bush lied or not and didn't even argue the point very well.     I'll be the first to recommend Moore's films to people, but O'Reilly's just more accustomed to the live format. I did, however, send in an e-mail to the Factor making some of the points I thought should have been made, so if you watch tomorrow you may get to hear old Bill read a letter from Ben Allen.    UPDATE: Here's the e-mail I wrote to The Factor in case it doesn't get on:     Bill,   I was disappointed with Moore's response on the "Did Bush lie?" question.  We   don't need to press whether he lied for the purposes of the election because   Bush made a colossal mistake which has cost us incredible amounts of money, but   more importantly the lives of hundreds of our troops as well as our ability to   credibly threaten countries like North Korea and Iran who we now know actually   possess WMDs.  Yes, Bush may have gotten bad info from lots of people about   Iraq, but he is the boss and ultimately is responsible for the decisions he   makes, especially in an election year.  Saddam was a horrible dictator, but I'd   feel a lot better if we weren't committed to nation building when Iran and N.   Korea are going nuclear.        If this were a company and you made mistakes of the magnitude Bush did with   Iraq, would your contract get renewed?  I think not, even if it was because   you got some bad info.        Sincerely,   Ben Allen   UPDATE #2:  Let's assume that this isn't going to make it onto national tv.  Why don't you readers post in the comments how you think O'Reilly would respond to my letter if it DID make it on.

Leon Holmes, recently confirmed 51-46 by the Senate to the federal district court in Arkansas, firmly believes that "the wife is to subordinate herself to the husband ... the woman is to place herself under the authority of the man."  In enlightening commentary, Sen.

Leave it to John McCain to distinguish himself again as a voice of reason: "McCain called Berger 'a fine and honorable man who we should presume innocent until proven guilty.'"

Yeah, the debate about how you get it done is big and complicated, but it's a debate I think we should be having.  Especially after the last four years, too much of the world sees America, and the power that it wields, as imperialistic;  a nation too powerful for the good of the world.  I think we need to show the world, and perhaps ourselves, that there is a lot of good we can do too, especially things that other countries can't do.  We need to inspire the world again.

      So Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser for his second term,  urlLink might  have taken some documents about the millenium from the National Archives. It sounds really bad when you say it, but read this article and it sounds a lot more like a an honest, if stupid, mistake than some clandestine coverup plot. I don't know, maybe that's not the whole story, but I looked for a conservative take on this and couldn't find one. Eh, we'll see if anything comes out of this, but this caught my eye:        Gergen said he thought that "it is suspicious" that word of the investigation of Berger would emerge just as the Sept. 11 commission is about to release its report, since "this investigation started months ago."

      So ol' Bill  urlLink Saffire  has another collumn about how those crazy liberals are totally wrong and that President Bush is the bestest leader ever and never ever lied about Iraq and in the process completely misses the fundamental issue in an election year.  Sure, he makes a lot of points about how Bush didn't lie and whatnot, but I'm not interested in that debate.  If Bush did lie, he could and should be impeached, but that's a harder case to make than the one we should be.  An election year is a time to do a job evaluation for the President and decide if his performance warrants a re-hire.  Yeah, to a certain extent Presidents are subject to the world they inherit.  Say what you like, there's nothing Bush could have done to avoid the inevitable collapse of the internet boom economy and likely couldn't have stopped September 11 from happening.  What's important is how a President deals with the world he inherits.  It doesn't matter, as far as the election goes, if Bush lied about Iraq.  The bottom line is that it's been a complete and utter fiasco.  It wasn't a threat and has left us bogged down instead of fighting terrorism.      If Bush worked for any company in the world and got the company in the mess that he's gotten this country in with Iraq he'd be fired without a second thought.  Whether or not he lied, he was WRONG and in a big way.  Being the President is a tough job and you're bound to make mistakes, but getting the country involved in a war we didn't need to be involved in, especially if it hinders our ability to address conflicts in other areas of the country, is a fire-able offense.

      I realized that I hadn't mentioned  urlLink Air America Radio  on here yet, so when I ran across this  urlLink post  on urlLink  Kos  about Air America actually beating some conservative punditry I thought the time was right.  For those that don't know, Air America is the liberal talk radio network concieved as an alternative to the likes of Rush/Michael Savage/ Sean Hannity and populated by people like Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo.  Al's show is pretty good, though it borrows humor from his books so if you've read them you might hear some repeated jokes.  The only show that I'm not terribly fond of is Randi Rhodes' show because it's a little too much like a liberal version of Rush, that is, mostly ideology and not terribly good arguments.  Anyway, it's only available in a select few markets now, but you can and should tune in over the internet and give it a listen, especially if you've ever had the radio on Hannity's show and ended up rolling your eyes and maybe even yelling at your radio.

      Hot on the heels of my stern reprisal of  urlLink Pandagon , they managed to have a great  urlLink post  on why all this tort reform crap the Republicans keep bringing up is rediculous.  As they say in the post, the idea that limiting rewards in medical malpractice cases is best for everyone ignores both the fact that nobody ever makes a very good case for the link between lawyers and the rising rates as well as the possibility that there are other causes which might be remedied in a better way.  If this explanation seem inadequate, well it is because the work was already done for me.  Go read the link.

      The one thing that has been annoying me about  urlLink Pandagon  lately is their incessant  urlLink whining  about Nader.  I know plenty of people disagree with me, but I'll say again that the best way for the Dems to deal with Nader is to ignore him.  Sure, you encourage Kerry make a few stump speeches here and there about how this is the year for people of all political leanings to unite in order to get Bush out of the White House, but bringing out all the whining every time some piece of Nader news happens sounds extremely petty and meaningless to me.

If that is the case, please disregard the introduction and replace it with a nice, numbing punch to the solar plexus.   Anyway, I'll pop in here from time to time to talk to you lovely boys and girls about things other than politics, which appears to be the central theme in this blog. Common topics from me range from music I've heard, things I've seen or just shit that flat out pisses me off.  There are more, but I'm going to run with those for now.  That's all for now.  P.S.

      A French literary theorist  urlLink takes a look at  ideological themes running through Harry Potter.   Harry Potter, probably unintentionally, thus appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of neoliberal capitalism. Like Orwellian totalitarianism, this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens. The underlying message to young fans is this: You can imagine as many fictional worlds, parallel universes or educational systems as you want, they will still all be regulated by the laws of the market. Given the success of the Harry Potter series, several generations of young people will be indelibly marked by this lesson.   Ahh, I love the French.

       urlLink David Brooks  spends some time this morning complaining about how often Kerry and Edwards use the word `values'.    When Kerry uses the word "values," it's meant to send a message: I am not who I am. I am not the blue-blooded prep-school kid who married two millionaires, dated a movie star and has a prenup and umpteen homes in tony locales; who has spent the past two decades as a moderately liberal senator from Massachusetts; and who likes to snowboard at Sun Valley and windsurf off Nantucket. I'm just your back-fence neighbor in Mayberry, out there in overalls, sidlin' over to the fence to chat:  "Howdy neighbor! Would you like to come visit for a spell and hear about my values of faith, hope and opportunity?   Yes, that's right:  because Kerry is rich and liberal, things like faith, hope, and opportunity (let's just pretend those are actually values) can't be important to him.  But wait, it gets better.  In his last three paragraphs, Brooks -- a prominent and fairly wealthy pundit -- manages to forget his net worth and complains in general terms about `these upper-class types [who] want our values'.  So, to sum up:  Rich people, especially rich liberal people, have different values from such exemplars of the working class as David Brooks.  They shouldn't pretend to care about faith, hope, and opportunity, because they don't have tattoos and aren't on the Atkins diet.   Update:   urlLink Eschaton  and  urlLink Pro-war.com  have more on Cons' understanding (or lack thereof) of the term `values'.  Fixed Blogger's odd formating decisions.

       urlLink Thomas Frank  on why the Hate Amendment is still dangerous after -- indeed, because of -- its inevitable crash and burn.       What explains this folly?              Not simple bigotry, as some pundits declared, or even simple politics. While it is true that the amendment was a classic election-year ploy, it owes its power as much to a peculiar narrative of class hostility as it does to homophobia or ideology. And in this narrative, success comes by losing.

      There are two basic types of grad students:  those who are aiming for a Ph.D, and everyone else, including `terminal master's' students (people who are only going for a master's degree), and `professional degree' students (future doctors, lawyers, and subscribers to the WSJ).  I can't speak for the everyone else, but the life of a future Ph.D revolves almost exclusively around school -- just keeping up with your classes is a full-time job.  Consequently, we have to support ourselves in one of two basic ways:  being paid to teach, and being paid to do research.      Doing research is, of course, the preferred way to go, because you have to do it anyway, might as well get paid for it.  Thus research money is more prestigious, and usually only given to students who've been around a few years.  The rest of us could, in theory, get a regular job -- I'm only spending eight of my sixteen waking hours a day doing homework and writing, a full-time job fits in there no problem!  But since I'm selfish and enjoy my (relative) sanity, I have to teach for my department.      Teaching (by which I mean either lecturing for a course or assisting the lecturer) is actually a decent gig.  For a glamorous $16k a year (before taxes) and the option to buy lousy health insurance, I work six hours a week during the summer, ten hours a week during the school year, and get 2 1/2 months of vacation.  The problem is that, if I am not represented by a union, my pay and benefits are basically whatever the university decides to give me.  For a single twenty-four-year-old who doesn't own a car and is still on his dad's health insurance, this isn't really a problem.  My pay+benefits package is designed for someone at my point in life.  It's somewhat different for, say, a twenty-seven-year-old man supporting his wife and newborn child.  Or, to pick another example from people I actually know, a woman in her mid-forties with a teenage daughter.      So what did the National Labor Relations Board decide today?  Well, if you happen to a grad student at a private university, you just have to live with your poverty, because  urlLink the school has no obligation to recognize your union whatsoever .  Their reasoning is that your relationship with the school is 100% student/institute of higher learning, and not in the NLRB's purview.  The fact that you are paid (a pittance) for performing a (critical) service for said institution that has nothing at all to do with your education doesn't make you an employee. You're just a student with the privilege of being financial dependent on your school.

I can't decide whether I like the claim that gay marriages are anti-diverse (because it's two of the SAME THING, and anyone who points out a wider definition of diversity is "emotionally-charged", "illogical", and "changing the rules of the argument") or the bit where they accuse gay couples of "using the opposite-sex as a second-class concubine, womb/sperm donor or nanny in a subservient role at their bidding" more.    Or, if you and your loved one need some amusement this fine evening, see how many logical fallacies and factual errors you can find in  urlLink this  eloquent and persuasive essay.

      Microsoft and Sony; two superpowers in the entertainment market going at each other throats and they've both got console systems in the works.  First rumors said that MS was thinking about a Fall 2005 launch for the Xbox 2, and now Sony's saying that the  urlLink Playstation 3  will be playable before next year's E3.  Of course, this could force Microsoft to release details about the Xbox 2 and its games before they wanted to and that would probably cut into the big Christmas push that every video game company has to do.  Now, having to buy an Xbox 2 in a year and a half, and believe me I'll HAVE to, doesn't really bother me.  Four years of Xbox games is pretty reasonable I think and it's certainly cheaper than upgrading a PC all the time.  In fact, I think a four year cycle is better than a five year cycle and for why I think that just look at most PS2 games and compare them to current top tier PC games and then imagine how they'll compare in a year and a half when the PS2 should be around 5 years old.  Four years seems long enough to me for developers to really take advantage of the hardware, especially if backwards compatibility becomes the standard that it seems to be, while updating the hardware just a little more frequently.

      Apparently anti-abortion pharmacists and doctors have been  urlLink refusing  to prescribe or distribute the Pill and other such contraceptives, construing them as potentially a form of abortion when a `breakthrough fertilization' fails to be implanted (though, as I understand it, the Pill does not make it more or less likely that a fertilized egg will implant successfully).    "Refusing women access to the Pill is a very disturbing trend," says Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. "The war on choice is not just about abortion anymore. It's about our right to birth control."  One of the many inadequacies of the Roe decision was that it legalized abortion to give medical professionals, eg, doctors and pharmacists, more freedom to determine treaments, prescriptions, and so on, instead of legalizing abortion to give women autonomy over their own bodies.  Under the former perspective, these anti-abortion doctors and pharmacists may withhold the Pill from women at their discretion; under the latter, feminist, perspective, pharmacists have no right to act as a gatekeeper to a woman's access to the Pill or other forms of contraception.    "I have a hard time with people who market themselves as women's health care physicians but who won't prescribe such a basic part of women's health care," says Anne Drapkin Lyerly, MD, a reproductive rights ethicist and an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University Medical Center. "We're seeing a growing trend among pharmacists and medical practitioners who consider it acceptable to impose their morality on women's bodies. I don't think moral aspects should be a concern. Imagine a pharmacist asking a customer whether his Viagra prescription is to enhance sexual performance in his marriage or in an extramarital affair. Never!"  Incidentally, a doctor who no longer prescribes the Pill is quoted as saying "I think most women feel life begins at fertilization".  While I can't speak for this today, it is certain not true historically; traditionally the beginning of life was associated with quickening (when the woman can feel the foetus kick, not when the Immortals start cutting each others' heads off).

      Thomas Franks' new book,  urlLink  What's the matter with Kansas?  , is an intriguing but ultimately only partly successful attempt to tackle the prima facie paradox of the contemporary political dominance of hard-core social and economic conservatism.  More specifically, there seem to be three basic political stances in the US these days:  Liberal on social and economic issues -- in favour, say, of legalizing gay marriage and a War on Poverty-style welfare system -- Conservative on social and economic issues -- opposed to legalizing gay marriage and in favour of welfare `reform' -- and a Moderate position -- which may not be committed one way or the other on gay marriage, but certainly wants to do whatever the Chamber of Commerce has in mind.  Any given individual might straddle more than one of these positions, of course; I'm thinking of these three more as archetypes of political opinions than a strict system of classification.  The leadership of both the Democratic and Republican parties is mostly Moderate (think Bob Dole and Bill Clinton), but the Conservative wing of the Republican party enjoys much more media and political prominence than the Liberal wing of the Republican party.    This prominence must come from some level of support at the polls.  But here is the paradox:  the sections of society which benefit from the actions of Conservatives in government are too small to be the bulk of this popular support.  There is a significant chunk of the working class population which votes Conservative, even as Conservatives in government have acted almost exclusively in ways that harm the working class.  Frank provides highlights of the 1998 platform of the Kansas Republican party:      * A flat tax or national sales tax to replace the graduated income tax (in which the rich pay more than the poor).  * The abolition of taxes on capital gains (that is, on money you make when you sell stock).  * The abolition of the estate tax.  * No ``governmental intervention in health care.''  * The eventual privatization of Social Security.  * Privatization in general.  * Deregulation in general and ``the operation of the free market system without government interference.''  * The turning over of all federal lands to the states.  * A prohibition on ``the use of taxpayer dollars to fund any election campaign.''  Along the way the document specifically endorsed the disastrous Freedom to Farm Act [which largely eliminated federal support for family farmers in favour of agribusiness], condemned agricultural price supports, and came out in favour of making soil conservation programs ``voluntary,'' perhaps out of nostalgia for the Dust Bowl days (76)    By contrast, prior to the mid-twentieth century (indeed, prior to the '60s), Liberalism, at least economic liberalism, enjoyed the support of almost all the American working class.  Recall that abolitionism, FDR, and William Jennings Bryan (a radical leftist fundamentalist politician early in the twentieth century) enjoyed overwhelming popular support, and the original Populist party was associated with calls for government support of farmers and other Liberal economic policies (32).  Frank undertakes to unravel this paradox by examining how his home state of Kansas shifted from radically liberal to radically conservative.  His approach, unfortunately, is anecdotal, not sociological, and I feel this is the critical weakness of his book.  However, his thesis is robust and intriguing, if not robustly supported.    Frank spends the first half of his book illustrating this gradual shift.  The second half lays out the sketch of his argument, and then fleshes things out with further anecdotes of his encounters with prominent Kansas Conservatives.    His resolution begins by noticing a striking parallel between the populist Liberal rhetoric prior to the '60s, and the populist Conservative rhetoric since then:  except for one crucial detail, they sound remarkably similar.     Even the rhetoric of the backlash, with all its regular-guy flourishes, sometimes appears to have been lifted whole cloth from the proletarian thirties.  The idea that average people are helpless pawns caught in a machine run by the elite comes straight from the vulgar-Marxist copybook, which taught generations of party members that  they inhabited a deterministic world where agency was reserved for capitalists. (130)   Conservative rhetoric, like Liberal rhetoric, engages and activates its audience, appealing to the latent outrage at the injustice of the present system.  But where the malevolent Other of Liberalism was the plutocrat, in Conservative rhetoric it is the elitist, technocratic, sophisticated yet simultaneously shallow, latte-swilling liberal who is using activist courts, political correctness, and rap music to threaten The American Way Of Life.    Of course, this is completely ridiculous, and only the most naive would buy into it without two critical features of the rest of our media landscape.  Liberals ARE, in fact, elitist, shallow, self-righteous assholes; and economics is incidental to the way the world works.  That is to say, the sort of liberals who are most prominent in the mainstream media -- Hollywood celebrities -- are condescending when they express a political opinion, and generally not a group of people to be admired.  The typical  This Modern World  fan or reader of  The Nation  is not someone the average Conservative voter is liable to be familiar with.  Similarly, the media have presented economic issues for decades as of interest only to businesswomen and -men -- welfare `reform' is something the stock market will like and saves money, a universal health care plan will hurt the insurance industry and cost money, not something workers need to carry about, because what really matters to real Americans is abortion, homosexuality, affirmative action, and `values'.    Hence, Conservatism enjoys such extraordinary popular support not only because it portrays itself as a radical rejection of the dominant power structure, but derives its credibility from the injustices of the dominant power structure and actually supports the dominant power structure in turn by lending popular support to economic policies that exploit the working class.  If you're thinking I'm being excessively Marxist, here's Frank:     Conservatism provides its followers with a parallel universe, furnished with all the same attractive pseudospiritual goods as the mainstream:  authenticity, rebellion, the nobility of victimhood, even individuality.  But the most important similarity between backlash and mainstream commercial culture is that both refuse to think about capitalism critically.  Indeed, conservative populism's total erasure of the economic could only happen in a culture like ours where material politics have already been muted and where the economic has largely been replaced by those aforementioned pseudospiritual fulfillments.  This is the basic lie of the backlash, the manipulative strategy that makes the whole senseless parade possible.  In all of its rejecting and nay-saying, it resolutely refuses to consider that the assaults on its values, the insults, and the Hollywood sneers are all products of capitalism as surely as are McDonald's hamburgers and Boeing 737s. 242    Over the past few days, I've found Frank's analysis to be a powerful tool in deconstructing such things as the progress (or lack thereof) of the Hate Amendment.  But theoria is not enough; we need praxis.  And what really needs to be done is to get his ideas dispersed as widely as possible, to start challenging Conservative rhetoric.  This last should be done, however, not by pedantically dissecting the logical fallacies and factual mistakes of Conservatives, but simply challenging the populist credentials of their ideas.  Is globalization in its current form really going to bring real income back up to its 1973 high?  Should our priorities on health care be with guaranteeing the bottom line of insurance companies, or with making people as healthy as possible?  Is testing teachers and students really going to make schools `accountable', and is `accountability' more of the problem with education than lack of proper allocated funding and the crappy pay teachers make?  While possibly personally offensive, is legal recognition of gay marriage really a threat to our society as a whole?    These are the sorts of questions I believe we should be asking our Conservative friends and family, and Liberals in the media and government should be asking Conservatives in the same places.  While not outstanding as a piece of social science, Thomas Franks' book is an excellent polemic and means to organize a promising challenge to Conservatism.  I highly recommend it.

      ETS administers the battery of standardized tests which states are required to use as part of the teacher certification process, as a part of NCLB.  But the tests were  urlLink misgraded .     The errors occurred from January 2003 to April 2004. During that time, the test - the Praxis Principles of Learning and Teaching for Grades 7 to 12, called the Praxis P.L.T. 7-12 - was given eight times, to a total of about 40,000 people.   That means ten percent of these potential teachers were erroneously failed.    But what's far more important, and naturally completely unquestioned by this article, is how one's general ability to teach can be measured by filling in scantron forms and writing short responses on a standardized test.  I have no problem with testing to make sure potential teachers are competent in the subject matter which they want to be teaching -- history teachers should know dates and names, physics teachers should know the right formulae, gym teachers should know how to blow a whistle and order pushups.  But the ability to manage a classroom and convey knowledge effectively is more akin to being able to perform on stage, and composed of so many distinct factors that it strikes me as absurd or naive or both to think it can be expressed as a single number, which is then compared to an arbitrary cutoff to determine whether the individual is to be allowed to teach or not.  The only way to determine whether an individual is a qualified teacher is to put them in a classroom and watch them.

       urlLink Salon  has a story up on  urlLink  Outfoxed  , a documentary exploring the propagandistic methods of Fox News.  You might think this is redundant, but the reviewer suggests the truth about the network that  Outfoxed  documents is as bad as, if not worse than, any of the jokes we might crack about it.  There isn't even a semblance of news or something worthy of the name journalism here.       Rather than politics, Fox News offers only lockstep ideology. It does not present arguments; it blends fearmongering and happy talk, rinses in red, white and blue, and pours the mixture down our throats. Instead of challenging its audience, it simultaneously terrifies and comforts them, painting a hostile world constantly in need of good, old-fashioned Republican-style American might. It shows us a busy screen of sound and fury, but devoid of all thought.    Interestingly,  Outfoxed  is not being distributed, partially as a way to cut down on inevitable lawsuits.  You can order a copy direct off the website, or check with  urlLink MoveOn  to find a screening party near you starting Tuesday.

Do we really live in a world where we take hard penis's for a test drive?  "I like the way it grabs the road, but I'm just not sure if it has enough get up and go."

      Another post on tonight's  urlLink  Hannity & Colmes  .  There's so much I could talk about with this, but William F. Buckley was on the show a little later and though Hannity was complementary, Colmes looked like he was fighting to keep his head out of Buckley's lap.  I know, I know, expecting quality balance out of this show is like expecting an episode of Oz to not include either a shiving or painful looking lube-less anal sex, but man, Colmes is such a flacid, which I'm making a noun from now on.  Partly because it's a good idea and partly because whiskey has made it sound like a great idea.  Part of the reason I'm so frustrated with this is that I read a shitty  urlLink article  today by famed sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card about how there's rampant liberal bias in the media except at the fair and balanced Fox News.  I hate bullshit, but I love whiskey.

      Keyes was on  urlLink Hannity & Colmes  tonight.  Foregoing the question of why he was the only person they talked to about Bush and the NAACP fiasco, Colmes actually managed to pick up a good point and then dropped it faster than you could say "token 'liberal'".  After Keyes went off about how Republicans represent the real moral values of black people Colmes managed to squeak, "Well then how come they all vote Democrat?"  Keyes stuttered out something that was barely understandable sentences, but he didn't have to worry because Colmes didn't follow up and Hannity jumped in to congratulate Keyes on trying to run a marathon, but the point is well taken and could be taken a bit further.  It's true that blacks overwhelmingly do not support gay marriage among some other liberal issues, but what Colmes should have asked is "Doesn't this just show that people don't vote moral issues but rather vote mostly on economic issues followed by more universally important issues like how a president runs a war?"  Furthermore, though Keyes essentially claims that the programs created during the Civil Rights Movement have hurt blacks beyond measure, Colmes doesn't question whether Keyes might have, in any way, benefitted from these programs, or if perhaps the programs simply haven't been implemented properly.  Instead, in true Colmes fashion, he just let it drop.  On a side note though, they had the mayor of Oakland on afterwards talking about the fundraiser Kerry was at the other night which contained lots of lewd language and bad talk about Bush.  Fans of the  West Wing  should find this oddly familiar.  Anyhow, the mayor was great.  Basically he said (paraphrasing), "Yeah, lots of things were said and they maybe weren't in the best of taste, but there are so many valid issues in this election that I can't imagine why people care.  I know it's tantalizing for cable news networks when something like this or the Cheney swearing thing happens, but if we could just focus on the issues even just a little more this time, I think we'd have plenty to talk about and the discourse would be much better for it."

      Seriously, this  urlLink outfit  must help distract her enemies but it has to make her teammates frustrated.  I also now see why some of her greatest enemies are the Hand Ninjas and I'm considering signing up.  Through  urlLink Evil Avatar , it seems that all potential sequels for either Daredevil or Electra franchises will depend on how the upcoming Electra feature does.  Also, apparantly Ben Affleck won't likely return as Daredevil.  I don't know why so many people didn't like the first DD movie.  I thought it was pretty good.  The mood was certainly gritty, right were it needed to be, and the action was good.  People complain about Affleck, but I thought he was tolerable enough and certainly didn't ruin anything.  It's not as good as Spiderman or the X-men, but since when is being less than superb something to complain about.

      It's looking like Bush's conservative base is  urlLink forcing  him to get more involved in the gay marriage debate.  If I were Bush I'd tell them to screw themselves, but that's just me.  It's not like they're going to vote for Kerry, and given how tight this election is liable to be I'm sure he can scare them enough to keep them from just staying home over this.  That being said it looks like he's going to push this harder, which could really hurt him with the ever-valuable undecided moderates.  We'll see how it pans out.  Like the article says, it's not looking like the bill will pass the senate anyway, so there's the distinct possibility that Bush could make himself look like an ass to moderates by coming out swinging for this and not even get anything out of it.

      Here's an  urlLink article  that makes the bold claim that most movies today are bland and undaring.  One thing the article really doesn't talk about is that both Passion and Fahrenheit were non-Hollywood movies and that there are plenty of bold movies being made outside the US as well as by indy film makers in the US.  I'd love to see Hollywood get a little more bold in their choice of films, but when they sink $100 million in a film they're not going to take many chances, they'll leave that to the indy films.

Maybe we should have put more toops on the ground in Afghanistan.  You know, just a thought.  As the article mentions, people in this area are naturally suspicious of Americans in general and this is going to play perfectly into their fears.  Commentators like to point out how silling their suspicions are all the time and how we're the good guys, but stuff like this and Abu Gharaib are what they see of "the good guys".

      Have I mentioned how much I'm enjoying  urlLink Barbara Ehrenreich's  tenure on the NYT Op-Ed page while Tom Friedman writes his latest hymn to globalization?      If marriage were a cure for poverty, I'd be the first to demand that H.H.S. spring for the Champagne and bridesmaids' dresses. But as Horn acknowledged to me, there is no evidence to that effect. Married couples are on average more prosperous than single mothers, but that doesn't mean marriage will lift the existing single mothers out of poverty. So what's the point of the administration's marriage meddling? Jacobs thinks that the administration's mixed signals on marriage — O.K. for paupers, a no-no for gays — are part of the conservative effort to "change the subject to marriage." From, for example, Iraq.

      The Dems  urlLink sent  their big lefty enforcer out to tangle with Nader and it looks like he swung pretty hard but didn't connect with anything.  Lots of people make a huge deal about Nader from both sides of the aisle this year.  Personally, it just doesn't keep me up at night; I leave that to the cold I've been nursing for a week now.  Listen, it's a pretty solid bet that at the actual voting booth Nader's not going to do better than a percent.  Yes, this is going to be a close election.  Yes, having a third party candidate on the left is never a good thing for a Democratic candidate and especially if the election is going to be decided in a small number of battleground states.  I don't know, I guess I'm still holding out hope that Nader's going to drop out of the race in October.  Maybe I'm not being realistic enough, but I'd rather have Kerry/Edwards and the rest of the Democrat machine focussed on stealing percentages from Bush by showing the country just what a crappy president he's been than fighting for that one percent Nader's clutching at.  I know the country's pretty polarized right now, but there have to be more voters that Kerry can steal from Bush than he can from Nader.

      The senator from Utah has an  urlLink editorial  up on The National Review about the threat of gay marriage and it's pretty much  what you'd expect.  He talks about activist judges while ignoring the fact that overturning laws, sometimes even popular laws, is and always has been within the purview of judges given their primary task of upholding the requirements of state and federal Constitutions.  He talks about how people in several states (New York, California, Oregon, etc.) have passed somewhat popular laws "defending" marriage, without mentioning, again, that people pass popular, but unconstitutional, laws all the time that have to be overturned by "activist" judges because, well, that's their job.  He lays out the "five fronts" of the war against traditional marriage: 1) State Constitutional challenges to state laws passed by voters. 2) Federal Constitutional challenges 3) challenges against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed by Congress in '96 4) challenges to state laws under the full faith and credit clause attempting to enforce marriages in one state in another, and 5) If all else fails, sue, sue, sue  First, 1) Again, many state Constitutions, like those already mentioned, have built into them even broader civil rights for the residents of that state than allotted to them by the US Constitution.  As much as Hatch might hate it, Constitutions trump laws every day of the week and any law that contradicts a part of a Constitution MUST be struck down.  It's just the way law works.  Most states have gotten around this by passing Constitutional Amendments, but that might not work as we'll soon see.  2) This is mostly going to fall under the 14th Amendment, specifically the part where it says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", which was then applied to the Federal Government through the 5th Amendment.  Let's break that down.  "Laws" must include laws and regulations on marriage and that's pretty obvious.  "Person" applies to gays as well as heteros.  "Equal protection" is where it gets a little tricky, but Constitutional law has said that if you can identify a group that is being legislated against in order to shut them out, that's not equal protection.  Rick Santorum can talk all he wants about beastiality, but just look at this article: these laws are targeted with specific intent to shut gays out of the institution of marriage.  Swap blacks for gays and see if this isn't a violation of the 14th Amendment.  In fact, it was like that right up until "activist judges" struck down popular laws against miscegenation.  3) Again, DOMA, being a law, must be Constitutional in order to be valid.  I think it's pretty obvious that it's not, but it also represents Congressional overreach, that is, Congress got its hands into making laws which have always been a state matter.  4) Though passing a law like DOMA is definitely overreaching, it's pretty clear now that it's not just a state matter anymore because of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Long story short, states have to give recognize the laws of other states so, for instance, a married couple from Texas can move to Florida and Florida must recognize their marriage because it was made under valid Texas law.  This really becomes a federal issue as you can see because if one state has a Constitutional amendment against gay marriage and another allows gay marriage we're going to run into trouble, sort of like when we had some states that said slavery was illegal and others that said it was a-okay.  5) Not much to say on that one.  The bottom line is that Hatch is right: gay marriage under the current legal system is inevitable.  We have amendments in the federal and most if not all state Constitutions requiring that we not make legal clubs which we can deny people from.  Heteros get over 1000 federal rights the moment they get married including rights about visitation in a medical emergency, what happens to children after death, inheritance, etc., and we're systematically saying to gays that they cannot have these rights.  It's illegal.  The only way to make it not illegal is to change the US Constitution, but the same could be said for segregating schools, establishing an official religion, or allowing defendants to be convicted without a trial.  All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others?

      Much like Salacious Crumb to her Jabba,  urlLink Peggy Noonan  points and laughs at Kerry and his Jedi mind tricks which don't work if you're targeting a giant mindless slug.  Much like her appraisal of Kerry's Edwards announcement, Noonan doesn't say anything worth going into much until the end of her piece, spending the first talking about how the Kerrys/Edwards' look like the Kennedys, how John Kerry doesn't wave like he should, and how she's not impressed with Teresa Heinz Kerry, which I'm sure keeps up Mrs. Kerry at night.  The the Pegster goes to her usual bat shit insane routine.    Does anyone care if John Kerry points to people in the crowd?  Noonan does, take a gander:   By the way, Republicans tend not to point at the crowd in this way. They wave. I think it's because their mothers taught them pointing is rude. Someday, in 2008 or 2012, there will, however, be a Republican pointer. And we will know history has truly changed. Because that man's mother will not have taught him that pointing is rude, for she was working 18 hours a day in a law firm, and forgot.   Then, when Kerry mentions that George Bush lied in the lead up to Iraq War 2.0 the Noonster does what any good Republican lap dog does and says he's in Michael Moore territory, which might not be such a bad thing now since no one has, to my knowledge, debunked Fahrenheit 9/11 in any substantial way.  But the best/insaniest part of this column is when she tries to argue that because Kerry didn't spend years in 'Nam that it's not an issue at all despite the fact that no one on the other side went at all and yet are claiming to be "War President" and such.  I really hope someone scratches Peggy's belly just like she likes this week 'cause she earned it.

      So evidently the  urlLink Bush Administration  has been sort of lax about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, that is, until now.  Not only are they now putting heavy pressure on the Pakistanis to find him before the November elections, they would prefer if he could be found on the day of the Democratic Convention.  I knew this was arguably the most political administration ever, but this really just makes me sick.  After farting out an attempt in Afghanistan and then completely side tracking ourselves in Iraq, we're only now, when it's politically necessary for survival are we going after the guy that masterminded the murder of over 3,000 Americans.  Come on liberal media, this is front page material.  Where are you?

      So nice old  urlLink Bill Cosby  likes to beat up on poor black kids.

How can Cosby expect poor inner-city black kids to act like rich suburban white kids?  That's supposed to be "their end of the bargain" as he calls it?  And as far as the swearing goes, I wonder if that's up across the board in America's youth.

      In a rather meandering  urlLink article , the NYT considers some of Bush's potential "bold new proposals" for the tax code, should he win a second term. While I can't speak to whether they're new or not, I can say that they make supply-side economics look downright sane.  Take this little gem for example:    One thought is to change the system so that it focuses less on taxing what people earn and more on taxing what they spend. Even without a sales tax, this could be accomplished by letting people deduct money they put in savings and investments from their income, so they would owe taxes only on what was left - in other words, essentially on what they spent.   First, it should be obvious how ridiculously regressive such a system would be: wealthier people have discretionary income to save or invest, and can funnel purchases through their employer (company car, company beach house), while working-class folks are struggling to pay the bills in their low-benefits job. Second, this tax reform would stimulate not job creation (I vaguely recall hearing Kerry talk about tax incentives for companies that create more and better jobs in the US), which is what the economy desperately needs, but setting one's money aside. There is an  indirect    way it  could    stimulate job creation, but this is even more tenuous than a straightforward supply-side tax cut, and much less straightforward than the direct incentives I mentioned in the last sentence.  So, on top of this shitty, regressive tax 'reform', you add things like health and retirement savings accounts, thereby screwing up the economy even more, and I start to wonder if Dick Cheney isn't an  urlLink evil genius , whose diabolical plot is to completely destroy the US economy. Or maybe the class in business school where you learn that people have to be able to buy your products is optional.

      So you probably have a moderate or conservative friend, relative, or sweetie who hasn't entirely made up their minds about this election, but are leaning towards Bush (or at least haven't fired them in their own minds yet).  You've talked about the war and the administration's (lack of) economic policy, how Kerry is a highly decorated Viet Nam vet who started his political career by protesting those aspects of the war we know recognize made it a mistake, and went on to become one of Congress' principle investigators.  They're just not quite sure that Bush is as bad as us liberals and leftists say he is.    Have them take a look at  urlLink this .  The New York Times -- as mainstream and respected a media outlet as one can find in the US these days -- offers a laundry list of the Bush administration's efforts to slash regulation designed to protect the interests of Americans as a whole.  And then remind them this is just a drop in the bucket -- ANWR drilling, more snowmobiles allowed in national parks, and more roads allowed in wildernesses come to immediately to my mind.

      I'm sure you're all going to hear this elsewhere before you read it here (since no-one seems to be around lately; or you just don't care about the things I post), but, unsurprisingly, the California Supreme Court has  urlLink declared  the same-sex marriages in SF earlier this year to be illegitimate -- Gavin Newsom, the mayor of SF, had no basis for declaring the state's anti-same-sex marriage law unconstitutional.

      With all this talk about importing drugs from Canada, has anyone even bothered to ask Canadians how they feel about the U.S. leeching off of Canada's taxpayer-funded health-care system?  Also, I personally get a kick out of the FDA claiming that drugs from Canada could potentially be hazardous to us Americans, because we don't know how or where the drugs are made. Because, of course, Canada is home to all sorts of third-world diseases and sweatshops, not to mention the little tiny detail of how we import everything else under the sun from them anyways.

      From the  urlLink New York Times  (you will probably have to register, if you haven't, and if you haven't, why haven't you yet?)  Kudos to Washington State for finding a way to simplify health care for elderly patients who usually take more than 10 pills a day with names like Hydrochlorothiazide and Hydrocodone/Aceteminophin 5/325, by electronically tracking each patient and assigning a nurse to them, and keeping it all in one accessible file, you think that would be a great plan.  But wait, Doctors are concerned that these elderly patients (who are already having trouble paying the $500 dollar-plus monthly tab for prescription drugs) won't be coming to the doctor's office as much, thus costing them money.  So I wonder who may win in the long run, the all powerful elderly-retired person's lobby, or the doctors?

      So  urlLink Dahlia Lithwick  is the Time's replacement for Thomas Friedman this month.  I haven't heard of her, but based on this column, I think I'm really going to miss Barbara Ehrenreich.    Today, Lithwick argues against rape shield laws, those laws which make the sexual history of a rape victim irrelevant and inadmissible in court.  Prior to the passage of these feminist-demanded laws, a rape trial centred on an investigation of the victim, to determine whether or not she `asked for it'.  These laws mean these investigation must focus, appropriately, on whether or not the victim gave her consent.  This is often a legally unanswerable question, but the present situation is still better than when the focus was on the victim.    As near as I can tell, Lithwick's argument is that, first, sometimes it's okay for a man to rape a woman friend, so long as she's a slut -- `the defendant's legal presumption of innocence is flipped on its head, since rape shield laws unambiguously deny him access to potentially exculpatory evidence' -- and, second, the media's going to dig up all the same dirt on her anyways, so we might as well parade her sexual history in front of the jury, too.    One word:  ugh.

      I just got and watched my copy of  urlLink Outfoxed , the documentary about how terribly Fox News misleads, lies, and distorts the truth.  First of all, for anyone in the Jersey area that wants to either come over and watch it with me or, because I smell poorly I know, just borrow it, please do.  There's not much new information for people that keep tabs on Fox, but it's a well put together take down of the network that purports to be "fair and balanced".  Also, for those of you in the Pacific Northwest, I'll be bringing this home with me next week if you wanna swing by the old Allen Compound to see the movie and give me recognizory nod or something, but not too close because, again, the smell.   Also, in the behind-the-scenes featurette one of the producers gave out this  urlLink website , where people can document how crappy Fox News is.  Being that doing that is the bread and butter of my political contributions to this site, I'm faced with a double edged sword.  On the one hand, my job just got a LOT easier.  On the other, I'm now largely unnecessary.   Hmmm, what to do....  I COULD always go through with my plan to make this a pay-porn site...

      I wasn't going to talk about  urlLink this  because it struck me as straight up dumb and because I'm feeling even EXTRA lazier than normal, but everyone else is talking about it and like my friend  urlLink Drew , whose  urlLink site  you should read frequently, I don't want my friends to be caught up in the bullshit storm.   So The Swift Boat Veterans For Truth have been hounding the Kerry campaign from the start.  In fact, some of them have been doing this since the 70s, now that's getting an early start!  All the latest buzz is about a new ad they made where a bunch of them essentially say that Kerry didn't do anything to deserve his medals and therefore must have, by implication, fooled the entire comand structure, who apparantly don't check up on these supposed acts of heroism much.  The problem is that none of these guys served with Kerry.  Some of them say that they got as close as with in FIFTY feet of Kerry's boat when the heroism shit went down, but, well, they weren't like, RIGHT THERE or anything.  Still, they probably know more than Kerry's crew, who were THERE in the more traditional sense of being, you know, next to the dude while he did stuff, all of whom support Kerry except one guy that's dead and one guy that has a personal gripe with Kerry but isn't involved with any efforts against him.   Like Drew, I can't imagine why the Bush campaign isn't putting the smack down on this group to shut up.  I mean, ok, I guess it's conceivable that an occasional medal gets distributed to a soldier that maybe didn't quite earn it, but for it to  happen four times to the same guy?  I just don't think Americans buy that, and bringing this up just serves to remind the voters that, yes, Kerry has four medals from fighting in a war he didn't even agree with, while Bush has no medals, mostly because he specifically avoided fighting in a war that he DID agree with.

      Hot on the  urlLink heals  of Missouri's anti-gay marriage amendment to their state constitution, a Washington Superior Court judge has just declared that denying gays access to marriage is a violation of their right to due process protected in the US Constitution under the 14th and 5th amendments. While this may seem like good but un-ground breaking news after all the hullabulloo in Massachusetts, it's actually potentially a lot more important than that. See, Washington is, while the MA isn't, one of the 38 states who have amended their state constitutions to define marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. This will surely go to the Supreme Court before it's done, but that 733t Washington judge may have just set us up the bomb!

      Take a look at this  urlLink discussion .  The author's trying to decide how the economy has done under Bush.  This pair of charts doesn't really give us any information to answer that question.    Yes, GDP has risen through most of W's term in office.  I guess.  The chart tells us what the ratio of GDP-now to GDP-a-year-ago is.  While our inflation rate is pretty low, for completeness the chart should explain whether these are real or nominal dollars (whether inflation is taken into account or not).    The second chart is even worse, because it tells us how these two employment surveys have been changing, now what the result of these surveys is.  For those of you who've taken calculus, we're looking at the derivative of the interesting function, not the function itself, and the only `slightly different' derivatives mask very different behaviour in the survey results -- for most of W's term, the Establishment numbers (how many people are getting a paycheque) have been falling, and the Household numbers (how many people have jobs) increasing.  Don't ask me to explain this, or the substantial difference between the two.  I do math, not econ.

       urlLink Kristof  briefly discusses some work re-interpreting the Koran -- how those 72 back-eyed virgins might actually be grapes instead, how the veil covering the face might be a belt secured to the hips.  One of the big areas of similar controversy in Biblical textual translation is the messianic prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 -- the word translated in the KJV as `virgin' might be better translated as `young woman'.  There's a good little introduction to this issue  urlLink here .  I find it amusing to compare this answer to the question with  urlLink this  evangelical answer to the question.    `Evangelical', incidentally, refers to a Christian who beliefs revelation comes primarily through the Bible, and that a good Christian pursues a thorough understanding of the Bible (as opposed to, say, a Unitarian, who emphasizes personal revelation over textual, and is liable to be less concerned about, for instance, what the Bible says about gay people than what they see by considering their gay friends and family).

      Not the Federal version, just an amendment to their  urlLink state constitution .  Here are some  urlLink election returns , and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch  urlLink story .   With 72% of precincts, reporting, the Hate Amendment is enjoying about 834,000 votes,  while just under 330,000 voted against it.  Yes, this issue was decided by one million people, in a state of five million.    Any law students care to explain what's liable to happen when a gay couple married in Boston moves to St. Louis, or the Federal gov't (Congress or the Supremes, take your pick) legalize gay marriage?

      From  urlLink the Chron :     Fingeroth agrees. "Buffy was like the female Spider-Man. The appeal of all the superheroes is the metaphorical value of their internal and external struggles, and she was portrayed as someone burdened by responsibility who just wants to have a normal life. That's how every adolescent feels."

      You were warned in the headline, and you'll be warned again here for the last time, this is going to be Spoiler City in this post. If you are planning on seeing this movie and want to go in without knowing everything about it, skip to my spoiler free post just below. Beyond here there be dragons...who spoil movie plots.  I guess it also goes without saying that the comments section will be open to spoiler discussion too. Well, I suppose it goes WITH saying since I just said it.    Now that all those spoiler-free pansies are out of the way, I have some thoughts on the thematic elements of the film that are bothersome. Well, I'd be remiss to tell you, and would likely catch a wicked beating if I didn't, that the initial ideas in this theory occurred to my girlfriend Sarah and that we then hammered it out a little more completely in the car ride home from the movie.  This movies seems to be something of an allegory for America's current global situation. As the Village America represents certain cultural, sociological, and ideological systems. These systems are largely at odds with a certain portion of the outer world, represented by the Towns in the film. The Village has real enemies in the world which represent a threat to the Village's way of life, but in combating these enemies, the leaders of the Village create a different enemy, the Creatures to keep the borders of the Village unbroken. Towns in the movie represent the rest of the world as well as a different ideological take on life, other oppositional religions (Islam) and disagreeable nations (the UN, perhaps) which can't be confronted in any physical way, but the creatures, like certain Middle Eastern leaders, represent an ugly force in the world which the Village Elders are able to convince their people present a real, precient, and physical danger. We see several deaths in the film and none of them are due in any way to actual encroachment by the Towns. Instead, all of the deaths happen because in protecting their way of life the elders have closed the Village off from any potential assistance, like medicine, which the outer-world affords. The real life-threatening danger in the movie is the fear created to preserve the society instead of forces from outside. The threat within is equally as dangerous as the threat from without, if not moreso.  My biggest problem with this movie, though there are many, is that when Ivy makes her journey into the "real" world, we see two people; Kevin and his boss. Kevin is white, young and compassionate. His boss, on the other hand, represents everything bad about the outside world: Knowledge from the paper he's reading, a detatchment from the needs of The Village, a desire to bind The Village to the rules of the outer-world, and, most disturbingly, brown people. This also, is the requisite Shyamalan cameo. While I feel the movie does posit the idea that the intra-danger is the most presently dangerous, the film personifies the extra-danger in minorities and ultimately reinforces the fear that the Village elders created.  There is more here, especially relating to Ivy and Noah, but I'm going to stop myself before this post balloons out of control. If a lively discussion erupts in the comments, I'm sure you'll all be treated to more of ever-so-thrilling analysis.  Please, comment away!

      I don't know what my problem is.  Maybe M. Night Shyamalan sneeks into my bedroom at night and whispers his secrets into my ears or maybe I'm just too smart (I HIGHLY doubt this), but I've never been suprised by his movies.  All the audible gasps in the audience when the big twist happen in movies like  The Sixth Sense  leave me completely confused.  If you have liked M.'s previous work I'm sure you'll like this one.  He does a good just of setting up tension and has a good eye for framing his shots.  Adrian Brody did well I thought as the mentally challanged man in our little hamlet.  Like his other films though, I felt that if you were watching the movie from the start you could see the inevitable twist coming a mile away and, as always, I didn't like what he did with it.  This isn't to say it's a bad film.  Certainly I've seen worse this year and probably even this summer.  It's just that the Shyamalan-ster does a great job of making trailers and I always go into the movie hoping it will be something it invevitably turns out not to be.  Also like his other films there are plot holes big enough to fit entirely complete plots within them, but if you like this film it really doesn't matter that much as is the case with most films.  Long story short, if you like M. Night Shyamalan's stuff you should go see it and you'll likely have a fun time.  If you, like me, are convinced by the trailers that THIS will be the movie where he does things differently, wait for DVD or On-Demand .    I have thematic problems with the film, but they require spoilers, so they'll go in the next post.

      The Times is  urlLink reporting  that the airline industry may be in need of a bailout on the order of the S&L bailout of the 80s.  Simply put, it means that the airlines have promised to pay their workers pensions as part of their legally binding contracts.  The law says that once a worker has earned the pension that has been promised the company is obligated to pay that worker's pension.  Unfortunately, it seems as though most of the major airlines have less money in the bank than they owe in pensions.  Shouldn't they be required to keep enough money in said bank to pay said pensions you might ask?  Well they're supposed to, but Congress has been loosening the requirements for years now.   I had a long rant about how this is exactly why people who think there shouldn't be any government regulation are out of this world crazy/dumb, but I think reading the article and thinking "What the hell is a retired person who suddenly doesn't have any more money coming to them supposed to do?" will lead you to that conclusion on your own.
