      I did it. No explanation, no introduction. I just posted it up there. Now we'll see what happens. It's an exercise in creativity. My theory is this: Having my live work in progress open to constructive feedback from an audience of random critics will hold me accountable to my story.  It will keep me writing, as is its sole reason for being.   I changed her name to Yasmin.  My four year old niece is named Yasmin.  I hope she doesn't mind.  But then, who wouldn't like to have a fairy-tale/adventure named after them? Yasmin it is.  I changed it from Madeleine, but I can't use Madeleine. Madeleine belongs to the story that Dana and I wrote. I can't take her away.   So, as soon as I figure out how these blogg thingies work, I will solicit friendly, constructive criticism on both my story and my writing style.  It's an experiment.  And please, even if you think it's utter crap, don't steal my words.  I claim copyright as of today, February 19, 2004.  Honor the artists' rights.  That's all I ask.

      Yasmin collapsed in her bed, exhausted.  Sleep engulfed her almost instantly.  And then, the dream began again.  In her dream, Yasmin paced barefoot in the sand, agitated.  This thing, this object, haunted her.  It drew her towards it, called to her from across the sea.  She would never know peace of mind until she found it.    Yasmin turned towards the ragged ocean waves, oblivious to the chilling September wind that whipped her hair across her face.  Her wistful gaze drifted over the water towards the East. I need to hold it in my hands, she thought.  She knelt and sifted sand through her fingers. Her eyes grew wide as she watched the sand begin to swirl around her.  It tore at her skin and hair.  Yasmin crossed her arms across her chest and closed her eyes.  She opened them seconds later to find the ocean had disappeared.  She was now gazing into an oval mirror on the wall.  Her hair was long and loose, and the color was an unfamiliar pale gold.  Behind her, a dark-haired woman laced up her flowing gauze gown.  Yasmin looked around her, startled and confused.  “Don’t worry, my Lady.  You will find it.  It’s a matter of time, that’s all.”  The woman’s voice was deep and soothing.  She smiled at Yasmin and placed a wreath of flowers in her hair.  Yasmin's hand rose to her throat and distractedly fingered the precious amethyst necklace she found there.  She wanted to protest, to scream that she didn’t know what she was looking for, but no words would escape her mouth.    “You and the Queen have an unbreakable bond.  She trusts you to find it for her.”  The woman placed her hands on Yasmin's shoulders and gently turned her away from the mirror.  The eyes Yasmin looked into reminded her of smoky, bubbling cauldrons.  She felt suddenly wary of the woman before her.  Who was she? Was she to be trusted?    The woman pulled Yasmin close and whispered into her ear.  “You must find it for the Queen.”  Her hands grabbed Yasmin's wrists tightly, and her soothing voice turned into a threatening snarl.  “You have no choice.”  Yasmin tried to pull away from the woman and in her fear, she stumbled backwards and fell against the oval mirror.  The mirror shattered and she felt pain as the shards of glass cut into her face and neck.  She screamed and remembered no more.  Yasmin awoke.  Her hair was drenched with sweat on the pillow.  She turned to look at the clock beside her bed.  It read 4:25 a.m.  She had been asleep for little more than two hours.  This dream had been haunting her for weeks.  The feeling of urgency had become increasingly more intense, and had recently begun to occupy her waking thoughts.    Her sleep interrupted, Yasmin stumbled towards the kitchen sink for a glass of water.  She shook her head to clear her mind, but the strong features of the dark-haired woman were ingrained in her mind.  She returned to her bedroom, which had now become cold and uninviting.  Her eyes widened as she perceived a subtle glow surrounding the mirror above her dresser.  The surface of the mirror was hazy. Yasmin stepped closer.  Pierced through the haze were the words “Legacy of the Veil.”

      Wilkommen! Bienvenue! Welcome!    Another work in progress. Actually, the very same beginning as  Guenevere's Heiress , revisited. I've been neglectful of the original, and want to start afresh. I'm taking a new direction...a Faerie Tale (with a moral!) for my new baby niece, Isla Rosabelle Jolie Millmow.   Guenevere is on the backburner for now. Comments&amp; constructive criticism are very much appreciated!!

      On Monday, I will officially become a grad student.  I'm psyched! Fate, or something, is on my side. I just got word today that Professor DiScala wants me to come to his class on Monday.  It's a colloqium on European Fascism.  Not exactly what I want to be studying, or focus my thesis on, but a fascinating subject nonetheless. And it's a free master's degree, if this assistantship pans out. I can't really argue with that. This guy is my champion. I feel like I'm being wooed!  Awesome.  I'm on my way to being Professor Huckins (Macgugan? maybe one day?), expert on English history and award-winning author.    If I hadn't been through the hell I went through last year, I don't think I would appreciate how good I have it right now nearly as much. Bring it on, world.

      I'm struggling to stay awake while Dave putzes. I promised I'd go to bed when he does, but life is hard! My eyes are sooo heavy.....  I was wondering, why the hell am I so uncomfortable around people? I'm always struggling to think of something clever to say, and it always comes out all wrong (chronic foot in the mouth disease).  I'm trying to be less of a hermit, I think I"m doing a little better at it.  Re-connecting with old friends, like Dana and Alissa, and discovering the reasons why we clicked in the first place. I guess I just plain ol' don't like talking. That's all. I would rather take the time to think carefully about what I want to say, and that's hard to do in fast-paced conversation. Maybe that's why I prefer writing.  You can jot it all down, and go back and edit and re-edit, and polish it, and then poof! A work of literary art.  But conversation is much, much more difficult.  I hope my kids have the gift of wit.    Kids!!! I don't know why, but Baby Fever has struck me with a vengeance. I never felt it before, but about two or three months ago, I started seeing women with prams, or pregnant ladies, and I would feel a stab of jealousy!! Why, oh why?! I'm nowhere near that point in my life, but I'm starting to have the yearning. A bit scary. I gotta catch me a husband first. yeah, I've got the most bee-yoo-tiful wedding dress that I'm just aching to wear!! I've never felt more gorgeous than the day I tried it on! I hope, when the day comes, I will still fit into it....maybe I'd better lay off the cooking adventures till then! OI!!!

      I feel insane today. I bouth $30 worth of junk food to stash in my drawer at work.  I guess I got tired of begging other people for treats, and decided to buy my own.  But, do I really need one package of Double Stuf Oreos, a box of Enteman's cookies, one bag of Hershey's Kisses, three bags of Goldfish, a bag of Pretzels, and Frosted Flakes Breakfast Bars?  yeah, scary.  but, I  love the fact that I'm filling out a bit.  Hanging out with Dave, all we do is eat! If we're not having a proper dinner date, we're having cooking adventures. I can't believe the changes in me over the past year.  One year ago, I held my pants up with safety pins. DS (and I still don't like him to this day, because of this comment) asked me, back then, if I was starving myself for my wedding.  First of all, if he knew anything at all about me, and bothered to talk to me on occasions other than when he needed something from me, he would have known that I was not having a wedding after all.  And second of all, that's really tactless!!! But, I digress. I feel more comfortable in my skin now. Another bonus point for Dave, and another reason I'm grateful for his existence.    Tonight, I experiment.  I'm going to transfer my blog to Dave's new Tiki Wiki web.  If it's successful, then hoorah!! A fun new shady toy for when I'm bored at work (more and more these days, oi!).  But now I'm tired. and I've got to help Davey get ready for an interview. FIngers crossed.

      This morning I rolled in at 9:15.  Not too terribly bad. But, I've decided, no more guilt about my chronic lateness. Today I walked in with BA, and I realized that he rolls in later than me every day, leaves for one hour to go to the gym every day, and usually leaves before me at the end of the day.  Ha. And he's a senior consultant.  So, that's it. My guilt has been absolved.  I’m Guilt-free, but incredibly irritable.  MM is insane today, and won't stop hovering by my desk to chat about his insanely violent 97 year old Scottish grandmother. There's a steady, strange banging sound coming from the pipes, and a burning smell coming from the kitchen.  Akhoehawjflha. Can't seem to get anything done.  Why won’t people leave me alone? Where are those Grumblecakes? (oh, Dana, I thought Dave and I were the only ones in the universe who knew Homestarrunner existed! Did you like the Thnickaman e-mail? How weird is that?!)  I went to Bath & Body Works to cash in my giftcard from Ashleigh, and got assaulted by three different salespeople on five separate occasions.  Dammit, people, I don't have any questions for you!!! I'm finding everything just fine, thanks!!!  I'M JUST LOOKING!!!! I was very, very frightened and fled without buying a damn thing. I don't wanna go back, don't make me go back....  But, my irritation melted away, grumbles are gone. Solved by……FRENCH FRIES!!!!! I wish all of life’s problems could be solved with French fries.    I’m starting to get fired up about Sunday’s Oscar party. It’s my biggest night of the year. It’ll break my bank, but hell, I’ve got to uphold my reputation as the person who throw’s the best Oscar parties around! Doesn’t matter to me if people are coming to be sarcastic, so long as they come. I keep telling Daisy it’s a party for her, but I think she sees right through it. No costume ideas yet (maybe Arwen? It’s suitably girly, as is my wont). Ashleigh intends to be the highball glass from Lost in Translation.  She's awesome! Cheers to that! And, she's dead set on winning the award prediction jackpot - over my dead body!!!  Okay, back to legitimate work. Ciao.  Postscript – why don’t my workmates ever say ‘bless you’ when I sneeze? I am always there for them! Grr…(discontent is growing; I’m just itching to be in school again, full time if I can swing it. Screw the corporate world.)

       Damn Lucky .  [Stealing D-Train’s idea of titling blogs, great idea!]  Not a bad weekend.  It’s finally starting to feel like spring, which improves my mood dramatically.  I was finally able to relax and accept that DM and I are in it for the long haul, and I don’t have to worry about winning him over. He’s pretty won.  And voila! Conversation flowed nicely.  My biggest fear is that we’ll run out of things to talk about, and that I’ll bore him, and then that’s it. But, I have to learn to accept that silences happen, and they don’t have to be uncomfortable, and I don’t have to rack my brain for interesting tidbits of conversation.  It’s much too stressful.  Yesterday was Bennifer’s wedding shower.  Very nice.  The Evil Dognapper did not make an appearance, thank God. Not that I would cause a scene at a friend’s wedding shower, but it would have been pretty damn awkward.  Her twin sister showed, though. I like AB, but in small doses.  She dominated every conversation and turned it into a speech about her teaching experience at Chelmsford High.  Thrilling. VERY hard to nod and smile, sometimes. But it was good to see others.  I think Bennifer will be really happy together.  They mellow each other out quite a bit, and he is very demonstrative of his affection.  Mum and Dad gave me a birthday party afterwards, so I’ve had enough cake to last the next three months. ‘Twas a bunt cake, with fake flowers in the middle.  She was so proud of herself for thinking of that! She really is a sweetheart. It was a nice little party with just the three of us, and Daisy. It felt like Christmas.  All sorts of new books, mostly historical fiction, some crazy Yoga DVD’s (“she’s on TV, so she must be good”, is what me mum said. Silly!) the world’s greatest hand lotion.  Fun stuff.  So, on the grad school front, the Graduate Program Director is trying to pull some strings to see if it’s not too late to secure the research assistantship.  I am on edge, waiting to hear from him. I would have to be in at least one class, which means I would start….today, possibly! I can’t believe I’m so close to being in school again. I’ve got the itch. I’m discontent at work, in general. Not because it’s a bad job, it’s just not what I want to be doing with my life. Not on a gorgeous sunny day like this.  Ahhhh I need to be outside….  And now I’ve missed my window of opportunity. It’s 4:23 and the sun went away. Much sadness!  DM and I are planning a romantic getaway to Montreal when the weather is nice again. I can’t wait. It’ll be a much-needed break from the mundane world. Everyone says it looks and feels like Europe.  We need to go. Of course, I would much prefer Venezia, but we can’t all be as rich as Sting and be able to afford a Tuscan villa with companion vineyard.  Anyways, I digress. Montreal.  Tres magnefique! I just melt when DM speaks French to me. But, I get a little disgruntled when he talks about Paris, because he went there with a former girlfriend. I know there are no feelings there, on his part, but the memories will still be there. I want to go somewhere new with him. I want to be the only one to see new things with him. Am I mad? Slightly.  So, Venezia it is!  Still no word from the U Mass Boston Graduate Director. Should I call? He’s teaching his class now, though. I could leave a voiecemail.  I am just itching to get into a class, even if it’s not English history…maybe I’ll have to wait for the summer. Maybe they will be better classes, so it’ll be worth it. Still, the dream of England remains…..will my impatience win out?  Or my practicality? Or my whim?  DM and I are moving in together in August.  I can’t wait. I’ve been dreaming about it. To have a place to share together! I was never so excited about moving in with TB. But with DM, it’s so different.  I know he is the reason I wasn’t meant to be with TB. I’ve told him that.  I trusted fate, and I was rewarded.  And I’m a  damn  lucky girl.

        Feeling very medieval today.  I have zero desire to crunch numbers. It’s just not what I’m mean to do! I told DM my idea to upload my Guenevere story to blogger, and to add bits to it every day.  Then he told me about Wiki, which tracks revisions and may be more useful for a live work in progress like this story.  I’m going to research it tonight.  Also, he said to be careful of ownership issues.  A very real concern.  I think making my story public will make me feel more accountable, and I’ll be better about keeping it up.  He’s got me writing again! I’ve got me a muse!  If I go with wiki, my username will have to be Wiki Wikado.   I’ve been on a haiku binge.  A few favorites, in traditional Jo style:  Oh, Venezia!  Alight from the gondolas Devilish masks sigh.  Chamomile garden Whimsical spells enchant Thrills remain intact.  Guinevere’s heiress Powerless to escape fate, Drawn into intrigue.   The roommate was driving me crazy last night, but DM took my grumbles away. He’s got a strange power over me. I can’t help but fear he’ll tire of me soon, though. I just can’t relax; I feel like I always have to be talking, and making him laugh.  Irrational, I think, because he’s just as mad about me as I am about him. Still, the fear lingers.

      I’m going to be incredibly generic and state, right off the bat, that the purpose of this “blog” (a new experience for me, I didn’t know what a blog was three days ago!), is to get me writing again. I know, everybody says that. And honestly, I don’t care. That is its only reason for existence. Well, that, and to give me something fun and shady to do while at work. I have Miss DM to thank for the inspiration. I was intrigued, reading her blog. It made me realize how similar we really are. It made me really miss her too! She’s my only college friend from Bama who I’m still in-touch with. Fairly understandable, since I was very much a recluse in college and didn’t really try to make friends. Except for T’s party crowd. Really not my scene; I wonder why it took me so long to realize that?!   So, now I have an easel to capture my random thoughts. Random being my favorite word at the moment. It may not all make sense. In fact, most of it probably won’t. But nonsense is underused in the unimaginative world we live in today, and it makes me sad. I figure I might be more likely to write in an online journal, than in my very empty real journal. Just because I love typing so much. It’s an experiment, really.   Today is a fairly non-descript day. Hard to get out of bed, after a wonderfully cozy weekend with DM (not the aforementioned Miss DM, but my very manly – yeah, I’ll get bonus points for that – boyfriend of seven months. You’ll probably hear a lot more about him in the future). DM made me fall out of my chair laughing today. We decided on the T into work this morning that John Kerry is actually Inspector Gadget. Think about it. The resemblance is alarming. Well, DM decided to prove our theory by posting side-by-side comparative pictures on his website. Sooo funny. I should probably get his permission before posting the link, but I’m dying to share it with the world.   My favorite song (at least this week) just came on winamp. Jump, Little Children: Close Your Eyes. A little mournful, but very, very pretty. It reminds me of DM. I’m also obsessed with The Scientist by Coldplay. Both songs are on my obsessive playlist of five or six songs I play over and over and over, driving my workmates mad (goal of the day!). I have to do what I can to make this office a little more lively.   So, it’s back to updating the database of natural gas spot prices. Fascinating stuff, honestly. No word from UMass Boston, I’m afraid I might have screwed up my chances to receive that research assistantship. Jo’s a dumbass. But, what can you do. We make mistakes. I make more than most. But, I’m at peace with my dumbass ways. Zen-ful, even. No matter; I’m thinking pretty seriously about staying in Boston, if for no other reason that to stay with DM. I can’t imagine not being with him.   and now, there is cake to be eaten (DS' 4oth birthday). Remember, don't get it right - get it written.

      My oral presentation was Success Rice!!! Everybody liked my topic, and it was very different from anyone else's. They could also tell I was really into it. I was nervous, though, and talked far too much and probably didn't make very much sense. My cheeks were burning the entire time. And I had trouble disguising my Anglophile-dom.  I think I even said "Queen Mum" and "our present Queen." Oi. I got some snickers for that. But, I think it's a good thing to have some enthusiasm for a project - if I'm to write twenty pages on it, it had better be interesting to me! I knew I could find an English angle on this subject....oh the intrigue. Was the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, really a fascist/Nazi sympathizer? Stay tuned!! (or, check out my wiki page for the developing story:   http://macgugan.net/tw/tiki-index.php?page=Windsor  AWESOME AI dream last night. I was auditioning for American Idol (despite being too old (!) for it - the cutoff is 24 or 25, Clay just managed to squeak by that rule), and I sang a horrendous version of "Over the Rainbow." I mean, it was really, really awful, but even Simon was nice about it. Somehow, I was given a second chance. This time, I sang "My Way," but it was the melodramatic Elvis Presley version. Still, it was horrendous, but apparently I was less horrendous than the other contestants, and I made it to the next round despite my complete lack of singability. ("you've got the raw talent, you just lack the formal training," is what Simon said. Good enough for me.) We were in some aircraft hangar in the South. I came bounding out of the audition to find Dave. I had never been so insanely elated before in my life. The next thing I know, I'm practicing with the other finalists in my parent's basement in Chelmsford, and I start crying. I'm upset because they're much better singers than I am, and I know I'll be knocked out of the competition right off the bat. But, still, for a few brief moments, I felt like an American Idol. Hoooo-rahhhh!!! I wish I could hold onto that feeling!!!  And, when I awoke, Elvis was playing on the Radio....My Way. Spoooky.

      I spent the entire weekend doing homework. Dave went to Montreal for Tom's bachelor party. Despite the presence of sexy canadian strippers, he missed me!!  The highlight of his trip was the continental breakfast, and I believe him. And I'm glad! He said our night playing CrossMate and drinking wine was more fun than Montreal with the boys. Not sure if I believe  that  one, though! I'm looking forward to our romantic Montreal getaway in May. I just hope it isn't tainted by the memory of those damn strippers!   For me, it was nary a break from books and computer screens. This is my life for the next few years! OI. but, secretly, I love it! This is what I do for fun. Research is like solving problems, being a detective. I stumbled upon a subject for my paper that I love - the Duke of Windsor (formerly King Edward VIII). Fascinating, enigmatic, and so very English! ahhh. I knew I could put a British spin on a class on European Fascism. hooo-rah for the Brits!

      Okay, so I'm sitting quietly at my desk, crunching numbers and minding my own business. Management walks by with their trash from lunch and, without a word to me, deposits the garbage in my personal bin, which is located right next to me, behind my desk. I feel invaded. I mean, I don't go out of my way to deposit my trash in, say, Harvey's office if I'm walking towards my little office space. I hold onto it until I reach my own garbage bin and deposit it accordingly. It's the courteous thing to do. The complete lack of privacy is really starting to irk me. Especially Friday, when my Mum called to tell me Uncle Joseph died. Here I was, out in the open, unable to have a private conversation with her as she was in tears on the other end. I can't even hide my own emotions. I can't hide from people. And some days, I just don't like people! Some days (most days?) I  want  to be a hermit! I can't shut my door like everyone else, I don't even have bloody cubicle walls! And random people have conversations all around me - I can't get a lick of work done. Should I say something to the boss man? I feel ripped off. And used. Apparently, I'm just here to accept your personal trash. Maybe I should make a sign? Or write on my hypothetical whiteboard? I realize I'm low on the totem pole, but I am also a very private person, and this situation does not suit me at all.   I'll defend my garbage bin to the death, dammit.

      Oh, I just had the best stretch ever. It felt so good, it inspired me to return to yoga. I don't know why I ever really left the yoga lifestyle - I felt ten millions times better, physically and mentally, when I did yoga every day. No, wait, I know why I left it- laziness. Lack of discipline. Making excuses and sleeping way too late. Time to change that, methinks. Maybe going back to yoga will dispel my winter blahs (which, BTW, should be dispelled by now by Mother Nature. Doesn’t she realize she's toying with people's emotions? Bloody hell). Okay, so...a new leaf will be turned. Tonight.   Dave was grumbly this morning. I get confused sometimes, because we'll be in the middle of a normal conversation, and he'll be in a fine mood, then all of a sudden he's irritable and stops talking. Mid-conversation. Mood plummets, grumbles begin, because somebody somewhere did something irritating. Baffling. I'm allowed to write this in my blog, because he knows I'm baffled. I think he is too. He made up for it, though, with a very romantic dip at Harvard Station. Total PDA. Yeah!! He shouldn’t feel bad for just being himself, though. People on the bus and T irritate me too, it's just not usually enough to affect my mood, unless I'm already grumbly to begin with. Which may have been the case with Davey this morning.  Spacing out on the bus last night, as Dave worked on a crossword puzzle next to me, (pause here for a moment - random readers of this blog may think we spend every minute of our day together. The truth is, we do.) we passed a place outside of Harvard called "Cleaning Portal." When you think of a portal, don't you imagine a passageway to weird and wonderful worlds? Worlds of whimsical beasties and magical spells? Not, as in the case of Harvard Square.....a Laundromat. Shattered my entire belief system.

      Dave and I had an amazing weekend of Eatfulness!! We never stopped cooking. And not the simple stuff. Big beef ribs with dry rub, whole artichokes with herb butter, french bread from scratch (fresh out of the oven-I have never tasted anything so yummy!). It never stopped! Best weekend ever. I feel healthy at last, gone are the days of holding my pants up with safety pins. I never had curves before - I love it.   We're saving our money for a romantic long weekend in Montreal, probably in May. It's so nice to have something to look forward to. It'll be after class is done. Class....OI. Bloody exhausting! But I love being a student again. I'm the ultimate nerd. Even today, running all over campus (I got so lost in the new student center - UMAss architects can kiss my arse.) doing random admin gave me a thrill. I told Dave that, when I was in high school and visiting the States for the summer, I used to walk around Harvard Yard with a notebook and lan armful of library books, pretending I was a Harvard student. How Nerdy is that?! He had a good laugh about it.

      I was feeling a little grumbly this morning, mostly because I kept thinking about the Holocaust conversation Dave and I had on the T this morning, and I kept having flashbacks to the heavy feeling I had when walking around Dachau. You could feel the evil that had happened there, like it was permanently ingrained in every element of the earth & buildings. Unforgettable. So, I forced myself to change my thoughts to something a little more uplifting. And what came out? The random words that have been floating around in my brain all week, struggling to become something, finally coalesced into a poem. And here it is.   Idyll (3/10/04)   The dream torments, it wraps itself into our thoughts Mired in the mundane, escape appears impossible. Until finally, resigned to the torture, we give in. Persuaded by thoughts of what might become The desire grows stronger, the hunger more powerful. Seeking adventures incompatible with idleness Imprisoned by responsibility And Flummoxed by feelings indescribable. Strength springs up, the source a mystery Afraid it might be fleeting, we clench the moment tightly Hands bleeding from bewildering strength We flee, triumphant.  The idyll, the escape, the restoration of faith. The dream realized.

      Choppy Blogs make me sad. I only have random snatches of shady time to jot down my thoughts. So I apologize.  But I’m really only apologizing to myself, since I’m my own audience.  Frustration.  Speaking of weird dreams….I dreamt last night that I was married to Will Ferrell. I don’t even like the lad, except of course for his role in Zoolander. But, we were newlyweds, and all kissy and cute.  Awww.  We were helicoptored into a very high security army base in an active war zone and dropped off at a gym, where we shot hoops and did calisthenics. I was mad about Will, because he made me laugh. Then I woke up next to Dave, and was so relieved that it was him and not Will Ferrel.    Why did Davey make me melt last night?  When I came home to him he was on the phone with his sister, but he put the phone down to give me a passionate welcome kiss.  Afterwards he told me he was thrilled to have someone he can be totally open with (he was referring to our heart-to-heart chat about his recent interview, and how he felt about it). He told me he’d never had someone like that (me) before. So I guess he was thinking about that yesterday, and he thought about me, and how much he loved me, and his toes curled.  It was probably the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me, ever.   I am amazed at how well fate has been treating me this year.   It was worth going through every minute of the hell of 2003 to get here.    Grad school is exhausting me already.  So much reading, and to find the time to get to the library and write a 20 page paper….OI!!! It’s all a bit overwhelming. But, I’m doing what I want to be doing, at last, and that feels so good. I may regret the full-time work in addition, who knows. Maybe next fall will be different, and I can work part-time. In any case, I’m on my way to being a History Professor! How cool is that?! Let’s just hope I can stick with it long enough to get my thesis written.  THEN we’ll deal with the PhD….maybe in England? The dream is still there, always will be there….  Actually, come to think of it, I've never been so open with anybody in my life, either. the Evolution of the Love Affair.  'Tis a wondrous thing!

      So grumbly today, and feeling generally out of sorts.  I’ve already snapped at several workmates, and my guilt is kicking in.  I just don’t want to do anything but blog today, but I’ve got piles of legitimate work to do, and constant interruptions.  Some days I just don’t like people. They make me mad!!! Blah. I had this dream the other night, that Dave ran into his ex-girlfriend and was so happy to see her.  He held her hands, and she leaned in really close to him to try to kiss him, and I just stood there watching and fuming. I woke up and I was so mad at him! I had to show my indignance by turning my back on him.  Irrational, I know, but dreams are powerful. But last night he was so loving, I just melted. I’m probably the luckiest girl I know!

      The Oscar party was a smash. Apparently, so was I.  Too much Vino! Oi!! Almost everybody showed up in costume.  Dave and I actually won the best dressed awards – he was Frodo, and I was Galadriel the Elf Queen – but I let him take the Oscar.  Of course, in my irrational drunkenness, I got mad at him later for it, because he voted for himself.  I think I was probably also pissed because he didn’t cast a vote for me, his girly. How noble of me. I hate how emotional I get when I’m drunk. I also yelled at him because he chose the wrong word and said I was feeling insecure about starting my graduate class. I hate being mad at him! He does nothing to deserve it! Poor Davey. Why and how he puts up with me I’ll never understand. Karma struck back, though. I was so nauseous I had to skip work on Monday. I almost didn’t make it to class, either. I sat on the bus, feeling like shite and thinking I was going to get sick any moment, although all I had in my belly was water, and got off the bus twice to ponder whether I should call the professor.  But in the end I made it. ‘Twas a long, long day.

      WONDERFUL mood. It must have something to do with Boston coming alive on the first real spring day we've had. I feel alive. I went for a lunchtime wander with the intention of taking pictures of the city for the new La Capra website, but my memory cards were full of weddings & Madeline & Dave watching a pot boil. I couldn't erase those treasures! So we'll save the photo traipse for another day. I wandered to Post Office Square, my favorite patch of grass to just BE, and was dismayed to find the grass roped off, and all the yuppie business men perched on the curb surrounding the grass. I did manage to find an illicit patch of grass and snoozed in the sun. This is what I've been waiting for - taking my shoes off in the middle of the workday and floating through soft grass. Delicious.   It's a quiet day, quite a relief after yesterday's madness. Last night Dave and I celebrated the resolution of my court summons situation (I have to give Tom credit for calming me through this whole affair. I truly admire him for helping me when he has every reason in the world to hate me.) with a traipse to J.P. licks for ice cream goodness. We walked back to the house, and it was the most beautiful starry night. I realized (for the millionth time) as we walked and laughed together, that I've never in my life met anyone like him, and how incredibly lucky I am that he chose me to share his life with. Together, we live in our own little world that nobody else could possibly understand. I love seeing him getting excited about our apartment search - every day he sends me links to apartment listings that look promising. He's awesome. The other day he surprised me with an indoor picnic for dinner. Life with him is never dull, that's for sure. I've never been so completely myself around anybody before. He's the only one. I just never imagined love could feel like this.  Sappy, no? I'll sign off. Weekend enchantfulness imminent....sipping wine at Harvard Square in the sunshine. Looking forward to some relaxation...Windsor paper is done (A-) at last!!! wooo-hoooo!!!!

      I busted Dave thinking about having babies the other day. Actually, he caught himself, and he was alarmed. Secretly, I was thrilled, but played it oh so cool. I was more thrilled by the fact that he sees me as a permanent part of his life and his future, than by the fact he mentioned babies to me. We were talking about getting our parents together for a dinner party at our new house, and he said something like his parents would be suspicious of an invitation and would think we were announcing a pregnancy. I said that's the last thing your parents need, another grandchild (they have three Rugrats running around their wee house). He said yeah, we should wait until Maddy (who's almost 2) is a boring age. Then he caught himself, and looked sheepish. I had to tease. It was adorable.   I just feel so content these days. Even this dumbass suing me for a car accident three years ago isn't really bringing me down. After all, I've got Harvey the super pain in the arse lawyer on my side. And Dave. He'll google anyone who crosses my path.

      Dave and I stumbled upon a TREASURE TROVE the other night. Walking down to Amy's house in the Heights - wasn't the Heights a terrible 90s show with Jamie Walters? "How do I Talk to an Angel?" the boy that beat up Donna Martin, and broke her arm? that show sucked!!! - Somebody put out four or five bags full of books, free for anyone to take. And they were awesome books - history, and psychology, and bestsellers, Harry Potters - we went a little insane, and ended up lugging about thirty of them to Amy's. I can't wait to get them back. I want to see my booty!!! yeah!!! that doesn't happen every day. yeah, that's what I need, more fun books so I won't read any of my text books! D'oh. But I was psyched - it made my day.  Good, no, GREAT weekend! Friday night, Scrabble and Vino with Dave. He kicked my butt (122 to 307, or something of the sort). I blame the Vino entirely. Saturday, tea with Mum at the Edwardian Tea Room (ahhh.....I felt like a Princess!), stumbling upon our nerdy treasure trove, and Chinese food at Amy's. Much fun playing with Maddy. She rode her harley and punched Elmo. Sunday.....what did we do Sunday? Slept till afternoon, heard crazy Vegas stories from JenEric, and went to the shops. Artichokes for dinner. yeah, I got the bonus points for that.  We're looking for a new house in earnest now. It's all so exciting. Finally, a roommate I love!!! yeah!!!! bonus John Wayne 3d Glasses!!   and, Saturday..... urlLink KAIJU BIG BATTEL  If you don't know what it is, check it out. You're missing out. (yeah, finally figured out how to post links!)

      Newest Poem, inspired by my Free Meatball Sandwhich (no, you're not supposed to understand a bit of it).  Lilting harbinger of spring Brilliant colors entwined, never to become untangled. Sluggish mortals roused by the sun. Reluctant to yield their melancholy,  They cling to the safety of winter. Elusive daydreams, now unleashed The destination realized, when shivering no longer The veil of gauze is lifted. Rewarded with a waltz from the ocean’s swells, Their lithe beauty revealed Revel in the enchantment of the moment.  You know, the more I think about it, the more I love Eternal Sunshine. It's on a par with Lost in Translation as one of the best movies I've seen in the past year. I can't quite put my finger on why, though. It's subtle. I think what I really loved was how Clementine and Joel were able to find each other again, even after the memory procedures. She experienced a recreation of her Joel memories with Elijah wood, but it didn't feel right to her. With Joel, it felt right. Their connection was deeper than just shared memories. Even the subplot with Mary and Dr. Howard reflected a deeper connection - Mary knew she loved Howard, even after her memory procedure. It's like the person you love is just instinct, and can never be erased. Awesome.  I wonder if that's the kind of connection that Dave and I have? If we hadn't run into each other at the Red Line, would we have met somewhere else at another time? Hmm.....  Bennifer's wedding - the other Jennifer, the one I've known since first or second grade. It was romantic, and unique, and intimate, and just really, really nice. Jen looked so sophisticated! Like a Renaissance Princess.  She and Ben are perfect for each other, they balance each other. Now they're sipping pina colada on the beach in the Dominican Republic. Lovely.  They held hands the entire ceremony. She was shaky, but also managed to laugh. Jenny stood in for Kristin as a bridesmaid, and whenever we looked at each other we both got teary. So I had to avoid her. But I'm thrilled for Jen. She deserves happiness with Ben after some of the losers who just weren't good enough for her.   And, Dave and I were told by the wedding couple that we had out-cuted them! That all they could see from their isolated head table were the two of us cuddling. AWww yeah!!!  I got him to dance, to a Jewel song. One dance is good. Baby steps, baby steps.

      I was diligently (at last!) writing my paper on the Duke of Windsor, and it struck me suddenly how very strange it must have been for Queen Elizabeth II to learn, upon the abdication of her uncle King Edward VIII and the accession of his brother the Duke of York, that she would be next in line for the throne.  She was never meant to be the Queen of England.  And how weird, and thrilling, for Elizabeth the Queen Mum, a woman of Scottish nobility, to learn she would assume the crown and have a throne next to her husband, the new King George VI?  definitely food for thought.  Exciting stuff, for a nerdy anglophile like me at least.  I feel a new story brewing...very unexpectedly!!!

      I've been feeling truly awful this week, and it's not helping my motivation in getting this paper written. Dave made me feel better with his Williker songs. He's insane. It's funny, I have the hardest time getting 'round to my homework, but I know when classes are done for the summer, I'll be missing it and  wishing  I had homework. Illogical, yeah? I think I'm just so far removed from college - it's been, what, four years since Bama? Oi, that makes me feel so old!! It's hard to get back into the rhythm again.    Daisy is having a panic attack from the construction workers across the street. When I was in the shower, she was whining at the bathroom door, so I let her in. She was literally trembling with fear. When I got out of the shower she refused to leave my side, everywhere I walked she was right at my feet. I guess she needed the reassurance. I felt horrible leaving her for my doctor's appointment. But, I'm back with her now. I took the day off to work on the paper. I'm so glad I can be with her. I've never seen her like this - she NEVER goes in the bathroom!! that's where the traumatic Bathies happen!!!!  Poor little bugger.

      I am just sitting here, wasting time. Doing everything but homework. I'm just not inspired. I love my class, and my subject, don't get me wrong. But...I just don't want to do the bloody work!!! I have zero direction from my Professor, I dont' even know what I'm getting paid to do. OI. Today has been bad....I've been a domestic goddess, I've taken Daisy for ten million walkies, but I just can't sit down and force myself to do the research. Ahhhh.....all I really want to do is look for an apartment!! I don't want to have to wait until September. I hate living the nomadic life, and never seeing my house. I just want to be in a comfortable place that I share with my beloved. It's not much to ask for, really. It's only April, though...nobody is advertising for September apartments. Grr....! get to work, Jo. You GOTTA do it. Maybe I'll just poke around Craig's List for ten minutes, and THEN do the homework....

       Ugh.  On Friday I had my first encounter with....an ex girlfiend. Dave and I bumped into his friend Ryan at Harvard station, and Liz was with him. It was very, very awkward. I was flustered all day. I still am, I bit. I hate the idea that he even has exes, and the fact that they seem to pop up all over the place really irks me. I hate the fact that he shares his past with these random harpies. I want to be the only one! He tells me I'm the only one that counts, that he's never felt this way towards anyone else, and I believe him. But what is it abou tme that makes him feel differently? I wish I knew. He said months ago, that together we have a clean slate, and the past doesn't even matter. I believe in that. But these hauntings, they still happen. It threw us both for a loop. She looked so different than I imagined her. Prettier (grrr.....) I don't even know how long they dated, all I know is they broke up three years ago. I hate to ask those questions. Talking about his past relationships always gives me a twinge of jealousy. Irrational, I know. I do know she drove him crazy. It sounds like he didn't even really like her all that much. It must have been even more awkward for her, I guess, to see the girl who's taken her place. I'm the one he wants to live with now. I can't wait!!! Everything just feels so right with him. I was never excited about living with Tom. It just sort of happened, it wasn't an event. I love the fact that Dave lets me inside; he trusts in  us.  And, he's the first one to break down my walls. I love him.  And now....I'm no longer flustered!! Hoo-rah!!!  I apologize to any random readers for the incredible sappiness. Im just really happy, for the first time in years and years and years. I did take the cue from the lovely Dana and implemented comments on my page (who would've thought it was so easy!), so knock yourselves out.

      Inspiration is so sporadic, and usually very unexpected.  Random haikus flashed through my mind on the T this morning (it was way too crowded to read my book, and when I try to read while standing I end up getting blue highlighter all over the sleeves of irate businessman. Not a pretty scene.) So, my literary brilliance revealed:   Writer's Block  Puckish thoughts whisper Blank pages impede progress Oceans of chaos.   Sacred Space  With vigor, defend The Sacred space invaded Latent fury unleashed.  Okay, not a true Haiku, because the last line has six syllables. But I like the way it sounds, so it stays. It’s a Joku. (BTW, this is in no way a comment on my garbage bin fiasco. I'm over that. I was merely perturbed this morn to find my supply of Tesco camomile teabags depleted.  Grrr… why don’t they traipse to England and get their own bloody teabags?!)   I feel much less blah than yesterday, but I still don’t feel like talking much. Methinks I will perk up with the onset of weekendfulness.   Elaine just informed me that I am a criminal. Apparently, there was an article in the paper this morn about Mass. Law, and betting on college basketball games is a misdemeanor. OI. And then, Lee chimed in with a story about the cops in her town who busted a Bridge ring at a senior citizen’s center. Apparently, they were betting in $.50 increments, and using the money to buy cookies. Oh those shady seniors. That scenario made me laugh; I think it’s worthy of a screenplay, no? hrm……  Apparently, Chris Martin has a bit of a temper! But, for a noble reason. I'm still a fan.    urlLink Coldplay Trouble   I  love  him and Gwyneth together. I have some pictures of them from Hello magazine, when she was first pregnant, and they look so fantastically happy. She's positively  glowing . That's how it should be. That's how it  will  be, when it's my turn. I still suffer from rampant baby fever, but Dave has no idea. I don't want to scare him off just yet!!! It's hard to be patient, but I know I have to be. I'm so ready to plan a future together. but, baby steps. Baby steps.

      Bewitching glacial breezes, with dastardly intent Pierce the soul and cripple the senses. Burdened with blame and born of unwavering lack of logic,  Forced to battle winter's bitter remnants.  The uninvited tickling escalates, unbearable, soothed only by elusive sun.  A decision not lightly made. Transported by will, or by fancy Among kelp-strewn diamond sands, sun-drenched spirits revive.  Crowned by summer's warming brilliance,  barefoot without trepidation, mocking the wicked winter.  Until, the wretched realization...'tis all in the mind.

      I hate what I'm seeing more and more of around the office. Somebody has a really great idea, we invite interested folks to a meeting to brainstorm about it, and management takes ownership and makes the decisions behind closed doors. And the people who came up with the original idea are not consulted, have no say in the direction it'll take, whatever. Exactly the opposite of what our high-priced outside observer suggested in her organizational report. Decisions should be delegated among all levels.   Or, take the damn website. I have had no say in this, my pet project from day one here at La Capra, except to act as a go-between for Dan and Chris. No creative input, no faith in my abilities. It's a dictatorship. That's all it is. And I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of having abolutely no say in how things are done, I'm tired of my thoughts and opinions being disregarded just because I'm Jo, the former receptionist. I DO have intelligence. I was a bloody valedictorian. I have a degree in PUBLIC RELATIONS. Apparently, this means nothing to the folks who want an outside source to write the content for the webpage.   Assignment: Write at least THREE kick-ass press releases, forward to Dictator asap for consideration. And if nothing comes of it, the jeorb hunt begins...... Frustrations. I haven't always been this discontent. I used to really love this place. I don't know what has changed, or when. I guess the dynamics just went haywire.   Okay, my ranting is over, before I get busted. I just had to get it out. Now I'll escape to the sun, for a bit, and stew over my frustrations.

      I wish it were easier to talk to people. Conversation isn't just an art, it's bloody hard!!! Even with people I've known for years, I never know what to say! I don't think it used to be so hard to find words. I think I was fine until the move to Germany. I was comfy in Chelmsford and had a great circle of friends (most of whom are still in my life - their letters to me were what got me through my time there). Then, I was uprooted at 11 years old, and transplanted to a very strange land of tiny villages, frightening beer bellies, and mean children who throw snowballs at Americans (but the food...AMAZING). I think I pouted the entire three years we were there, which is why my powers of pout are now perfected. And somehow, I lost my ability to talk without stumbling over my words, and constantly (mostly unsuccessully) racking my brain for what to say next. Middle school is miserable for everyone, but does everyone go to a school where the entire grade is  fewer than 8 people?! My best friend wasn't the nicest person, either. My self-confidence just plummeted somewhere in the move to Germany, and I haven't quite regained it yet. Silly, no? How can one event so far in the past still affect me so strongly? I'm still uneasy in social situations. Why can't I just get over it? That's why dating was so hard - what do you say when you're plum run out of words? It doesn't happen with Dave, thank goodness for that. I hope I don't have to deal with the stress of random dating ever again.  It was nice, the other night with Dave's family. I felt comfortable. His mom and I started out sort of shy around each other at first, neither of us really knowing what to talk about, but we've since opened up quite a bit. And last weekend was very easy. I think she likes me. She kept sneaking pictures of me, but not taking any of Dave!  You know what that means....she's been talking, and people are asking for pictures....oi. life is hard!   I thought I would miss tom's family much more than I do. I miss Lizzie the most, I think. I pretty much watched her grow up. I remember urging her to sneak a sip of Tom's Guinness when he wasn't looking, and she got a little tipsy (she was eight, I think), and then had a temper tantrum when it was time for bed. Now, she's a hip & trendy tween, practicing for her license. It's amazing to me. She'll always be a tipsy eight year old in my mind.  What's even more amazing to me, is the fact that this tiny little Isla, now a part of my family exists on the other side of the ocean, and I haven't seen so much as one picture proving her existence. AHH!!!   'Nuff ramblin, for now at least. My thoughts are scattered all over the place.  One final thought: Why exactly do the Germans adore David Hasselhoff? The guy has had 40+ platinum albumes over there....and I just don't get it.

      Yet another cause for celebration - Dave was offered a job today!!! It sounds awesome.  It'll be so good for him. Now, he can be my sugar daddy. heh heh heh....honestly, though, I don't know anybody who deserves this more than him. He has suffered in a shitty temp job for about two years (ish) now, and he's miserable and grumbly. But he stuck it out, and now good things are happening. On top of that, we've got a house to look forward to! I still can't believe our good fortune of late. Is this karma? Will it end abruptly? I can't really imagine what could possibly go wrong. I'm just enjoying it, and trying not to let my neuroses get the better of me. I think he'll be happy in this new job. Now, we just need a car.....  I wish I could just up and change my job. It's getting duller every day. And people are getting ruder. This new guy, I thought he was going to be pretty cool, but apparently he just another "I'm so much smarter than thou."  I'm incredibly tired of getting that vibe. Just because I don't understand (or care about!) what goes into creating a 345 K transmission line across the state of Vermont, does that mean I'm less intelligent? I hate pissing contests, but there are a million things I could do better than half of those gits. Doug was amazed that I know how to make webpages, and that I do it for fun!! He didn't think me capable.   Oi. I've got to stop the whining. Tonight is a  Happy  night. Monday is over, and it's still sunny enough to walk to the center of town with Daisy to visit Dave at the salon. Bummer he has to clean today, of all days. Our one year anniversary is also on a cleaning day. grrr.....maybe he won't need the salon job soon! yeah!  Awesome weekend. I took Friday off, for no good reason at all, other than becasue I needed a day to myself to recharge. And it worked wonders. Friday night was Jen's birthday, I think she had a good time! We met at the Red Line, brought back a few memories! and those mojitos....oh wow. But most importantly, Jen had fun. I feel like we're getting to be friends, and that's a really good feeling, since she's marrying one of Dave's best friends! It would be stupid not to get along! Saturday was pretty mellow. Rainy, so Dave and I putzed with our respective computer projects (mythical brit is a LONG way off, but I'm determined to see it through!) Then we drank wine and played Settlers of Cataan (I was much less moody this time around, no encounters with random harpies to bring me down!) and went for a random food-shopping trip. Yesterday was Maddie's 2nd birthday. We had so much fun. Dave's family was all there, and it really felt like they were my family too. Very warm and welcoming. Anthony's brother looks like Jude Law! Maddie had the best time. We danced to Mob hits, and Elmo made a couple of appearances. Elmo put the moves on me, too!! Freshy fresherson!!! I was exhausted but it was a really good kind of exhausted.   I adore weekends. 'tis a shame they're so damn fleeting.

      As of Thursday 24 June, Baby Millmow will henceforth be known as:   Isla Rosabelle Jolie Millmow.   Isla I love, Jolie I can accept, Rosabelle I'm not such a big fan of. But, my little English Munchkin across the sea has a name, and that gives me a delicious little thrill. Now if I could just meet her!

      I've been feeling generally out of sorts the past few days. A little depressed, but I'm not sure why. Good things are happening - Dave and I got a house, Lara had her baby, Dave has a very promising job interview, and I got my research assistantship renewed. But, I don't know. I just feel blah. Something is weighing me down. I took the day off of work today just to recharge, and pamper myself a bit. It's helping. I hate lying to work, but I didn't need to get anything specific done today anyway. It's just me and Daisy, hanging out, chillin like villains. We'll go to the shops in a bit for a gift for Jen's birthday. Hopefull we'll have a new job for Dave to celebrate tonight, as well as her birthday.   I've been thinking a lot about my engagement ring. I promised Dave I wouldn't take it into the new house with me, and I intend to keep that promise. Clean slate. I've asked a few people for advice, and some suggested donating to charity. But I just don't feel right knowing it'll end up in the hands of some random person. I wish to God Tom had just accepted it when I tried to give it to him. I think I will just send it to him. We need the closure, and it's been enough time, the pain isn't so raw. I don't want to hurt Dave by keeping it. I told him it doesn't mean anything to me, and I meant it. If it did mean something to me, I would still be wearing it. But I chose not to. It's been a burden, more than anything. I'll send it. I'll tell Dave tonight. I want to tell him now, but he's off on his interview. Stressful enough for him, without me adding to his stresses. I'm looking forward to just relaxing this weekend. We sorely need it.   I'm still feeling horrible about our fight the other night. I overreacted, badly. Dave didn't do anything wrong, and in my selfishness I didn't see that he was actually looking out for my feelings and probably made the best judgment in the matter. Still, I get pouty. I can't help it. I know when I'm being irrational, and I do it anyway.   But then, sanity is overrated, isn't it?

      what does it mean to be fed up? where does the phrase come from? Is it only my sweet but sadly outdated mum who says it? doesn't matter, it describes my mood today. I'm tired of my job. I'm not miserable, by any means, but today, one million tiny frustrations just seemed to escalate into one uber-cranky Jo.  I guess I'm feeling underappreciated. I was in a bad mood to start the day, after fighting with Dave last night over nothing more than my own bloody stupid irrationality. Then, in today's marketing meeting, which I've been very proud to have taken ownership of since Leslie left the company, Steve and I introduced our new product, which I've been slaving over daily for about a month. The Grand Unveiling went over really, really well. People were psyched. and, somehow Steve got the credit, when I built the bloody thing! I was livid. Not at Steve, because he did speak up for me, but at Dan, the boss man, because he just assumed that, because I'm not an analyst, Steve did the brunt of the work. Complete untruth. I'm tired. I'm restless. ENERGY CONSULTING BORES ME.  Am I the only one that thinks this way? I finally escaped to Post Office Square to lie in the softest grass the earth has ever produced, and dozed for about twenty minutes and cleared my mind of its rubble. Then, I get back to the desk, feeling a little less flustered, and Dave had stolen the grumble crown. I don't like to broadcast his business, but he had reason to be grumbly. And it lifted my spirits to be his cheerleader, and try to lift  his   grumbles. Is that how love works? I guess so. I feel a little sheepish, when I realize that probably 80% of this entire blog has been devoted to Dave and my feelings for him. But, that's my life right now! C'est la vie!  I read Dana's blog today, and she was commenting on how everyone in the blogger world seems to be completely wrapped up in politics. Again, with the sheepishness, because I'm so wrapped up in my own life, that I've completely tuned out what's going on in the world. Not having a TV has been a strange and wonderful experience, but sometimes I really do feel out of touch. I'd love to post my political opinions, but I'd probably get jailed under some article of the Patriot Act. So I choose to refrain. But know this....if Bush gets re-elected, I'm leaving on the first plane for the British Virgin Islands. Anybody with me?

       I met my favorite person.   It's a mighty silly story. But I love telling it. 'twas my friend Marie's 25th birthday.  I met Marie and her friend Pardis for dinner at Cibo in the North End (one of the world's great Italian restaurants, complete with wacky waiters). From there we traipsed to a very crowded, very overpriced bar on Newbury Street, which Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are fond of renting out for New Year's Eve parties (neither showed for Marie's birthday party - we were pretty insulted). We quickly tired of the Newbury Street scene, and decided for whatever reason to traipse to Pardis' house near Porter Square. On the way, we got drenched in a downpour and spent the time at Pardis' house waiting for clothes to dry, and brainstorming the best place to get more drinks. Eventually, we jumped in a taxi and ended up at the Red Line in Hah-vahd Square. Fateful Decision.  Since Marie was single at the time, and no girl should go without a birthday kiss on her 25th, Pardis and I made it our night's mission to get her a kiss from a random guy in a bar. We proceeded to get very, very drunk. I danced with a dork named Carl, and I think we made out on the dance floor (not my proudest moment...yech.) Marie and Pardis started talking to a couple guys, then started dancing with them. Pardis danced with Dave, and Marie danced with Derek. Then we all made our way back to our table, with the new guys. Thankfully, Carl ditched me for another girl. And then I met Dave. INSTANT chemistry. We chatted, and drank, and then...he gave Marie a birthday smooch. a LOUD one. And I felt a strange little twinge of jealousy.  There's more to the story, but one must maintain an element of MYSTERY. Nothing happened between Dave and I that night, but the attraction was there. It wasn't until one month later when Pardis and Derek tricked us into a double date, that we got together. So I'm incredibly grateful to Pardis and Derek for that.   And tonight, there will be CHAMPAGNE, and DANCING, and...Friday we're going to the Red Line, but for Jen's Birthday party, not for nostalgic reasons. And I WON'T be dancing with random guys named Carl, and Dave WON'T be kissing random birthday girls.  That's the story of how we began....silly, no?

      I've just realized I never formally announced the birth of Baby Millmow #3. So, without further ado:  Please welcome Baby Millmow to the World! She was born at 6:05 p.m. Greenwhich Mean Time in Exeter, Devonshire, England, weighing just under 9 pounds, on Wednesday 16 June. She has not yet chosen a name. She is the newest member of the Millmow clan, consisting of father Martin, mother Lara, and very proud big sisters Paris Katya Adele Sinatra, 6, and Yasmin Aurora Elizabeth, 5 (maybe if the wacky parents hadn't used up all those beautiful names on the first two, they might, perhaps, already have a few left over for Baby?  hrm.... )  HOOOOOORRRRAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!

      I'm breathless. It has been an insane, momentous week for the Huckins/MacGugans! My head is spinning. It's almost a little unsettling, I'm  not used to so much good fortune at once, especially in stark contrast to the string of misfortunes that plagued me last year. I don't feel like I deserve this happiness, somehow. But, maybe I do. I hit rock bottom, and maybe this is what it feels like to climb back into the light?   First, Dave and I found a house. A HOUSE, not an apartment! It was so much more than we were expecting. The landlord absolutely LOVED us, for whatever reason, and really pushed us to act quickly. That made me a little uncomfortable, and Dave even did some research into his background. But, it turns out he's legit, and really wanted us for tenants. I'm psyched! Now it feels real. We saw the house on Tuesday and signed the lease on Wednesday. The house is in Medford, right around the corner from Dave's best friend and his wife, which is very cool, as well as one of my exes, and one of Dave's exes, which is not so cool. I hope we can avoid the drama of running into one of THOSE ghosts from the past!! Great neighborhood, though. We can walk to Davis Square in fifteen minutes. We're surrounded by old people, so it'll be quiet. There's a yard for Daisy, three bedrooms (still haggling over the third bedroom - I want a library/yoga space, Dave wants an art/music studio. I can pout WAY better than him, so we'll see who wins this one!!!) There's a random (functional!) toilet hanging out in the basement, which I find very funny, and the house comes with a Kayak, which we're free to use!! AWESOME. I still can't believe Dave wants to live with me - what makes me so different from the others that he's willing to give up his hermit lifestyle? We're going to make a home together, and I couldn't be happier. It feels like the natural thing to do.  Jen and Eric had us over for celebratory drinks last night, and they and Kiran surprised us with gifts! Vino from JenEric, and AWESOME margarita glasses from Kiran. It was so unexpected. I honestly just wanted to share my happiness with everyone, which is why I broadcast the news. I didn't expect to get anything for it! I love having thoughtful friends! And, I love the fact that Dave's friends have accepted me as their friends. It's a great bunch - I haven't met one bad egg yet.  So that's that. Then, Lara gave birth to baby Millmow Number 3 on Wednesday! She's got reddish hair, blue eyes, and weighed nearly nine pounds. And, as of yet, does not have a name. I got teary when I heard the news, because I'm just aching to meet her, and she's so far away. I'm broke from the apartment fees/deposits etc., and there's no way I'm going to make it there for a while. It's so weird to think that there's a little creature that came out of my sister, on the other side of the Atlantic, that I've yet to meet. But, I'm thrilled. And Paris and Yasmin are psyched to be big sisters.   Then, item number three, Dave has an interview today! I've got a really good feeling about this one. Tom put in a good word for him, and the IT guy really liked his resume. The company looks awesome. They provide web services for musicians.   urlLink Nimbit   It would be perfect for Dave. I'm sending out all the good vibes I can muster. He deserves this, he's been so patient at CopyTech for so long. We'll see what happens.   MythicalBrit.com is coming along. It's mostly ideas at this stage, and very little is in writing, but I finally came up with a design for the homepage. It's going to be a medieval arched stained glass window with links to the various subpages. I can envision it, vividly, in my mind, but getting it on paper, and then into Dreamweaver, is a horse of a different color. Thank goodness I've got a brilliant boyfriend who knows this stuff inside and out!  This has turned into quite a monster ramble. Terrible for the already suffering work ethic. But, I'm feeling pretty Zenful, at the moment. Life is very, very good.

      I finished my article for Che-denfreude. It ended up being a ramblin' essay on Jennifer Lopez.  Random, yes. Timely, yes. A little bit sympathetic, a little bit scathing. I just hope it's entertaining to the readers (though I'm still not sure who the readers will be...maybe we need to brainstorm a marketing campaign?). My next trick is to turn my focus to Mythical Brit.com. Or maybe a serial story for Che-denfreude. Or maybe, just maybe...a stolen moment of SLEEP. Novelty! I can't remember the last evening I had all to myself.  Probably the night of the Friends finale, when Beth came home to find me weeping because I thought Ross and Rachel  wouldn't  end up together. I like being alone. But I've discovered I like being with Dave so much more.  you know I've GOTTA end on a sappy note!  good night.

      Haven't blogged in ages. Haven't written  anything  in ages! I really can't call myself a writer anymore. Inspiration is far too sporadic. I've been racking my brain to come up with an article idea for Jen's website, and NOTHING comes to me!!! Was it always this difficult? My brain is mush, and my memory swiss cheese. But, I'm not going to bed tonight until it's DONE. Dave's at poker night, so I have no excuses to be distracted.  We viewed a house today, with a perfect yard for the Daisy. I want it! It's in Medford, near Tufts. It's a little shabby, but hell...it's a HOUSE! And that'll do nicely. My mind is anywhere but on my article...last weekend was fabulous. We rented a car and went to CHelmsford for Lisa's dance recital. I had to go, it's ritual now. Last year I met Dave on the night of her recital, so I guess it's good luck! THen we saw Harry Potter. INCREDIBLE. Blew the first two away. Everything about it was different. It was more about Harry this time. And the sets...amazing. Totally new castle. Less Hollywood glamour, and more medieval feeling. I loved every minute of it. Not enough Snape, though! Harry is turning into a handsome boy! oh my goodness!!   Sunday we went to the beach. Spontaneous. We found a rocky beach away from the boardwalk where we could take Daisy, and she had a blast. It was our own beach, nobody else around. Of course I got roasted but it was worth every minute. Very romantic. We're like a little family, now. I love it. I think Dave is pretty much permanent in my life. I even miss him when he's at poker night. He really wants this house. If it's meant to be ours...it will be. How's THAT for fatalism?

      Seems like ages since I've attempted the bloggy bloggerson. Much has happened....first up, Montreal. We had a fantastic time. All we did was eat at fantastic restaurants (Dave discovered the world's best Thai) and walked it all off, wandering aimlessly and having random adventures. We also found the world's most romantic restaurant, in the enchanting Old City (but, beware the aggressive restaurant hosts who will stop at NOTHING to get you inside!!!). I was a wee bit disappointed, because the city didn’t feel quite as European as I imagined it to be. I thought it would be like mini-Paris. But the Old City had tons of character. We had a smelly room, but it was bearable. Everyone was surprised to hear we didn't party it up, and visit the crazy strip clubs and dance clubs and all that fun stuff....but I try to tell them, we're a boring middle-aged couple! I'd much rather settle in for the night with a bottle of wine and a game of Lost Cities (yeah, I schooled him! But he came back, post-Holiday, and whipped me. Now I owe him a twelve pack of Heinies...grrr!). But all in all, it was a most romantic vacation.  No luck on the apartment front yet. I'm still wistful about the one in Medford we turned down. But, we should trust our instinct. If we were so torn about it, it wasn't the one. It shouldn't be this complicated. But, deep in my heart, I KNOW I'll be comparing every apartment we see to that one. It was gorgeous....shake it off. There will be others....  Lately I've been an insane Salt addict!! I can't get enough! I devour those overly-salted bagels from Finagle like the world's ending tomorrow. I can't explain it. I know I’m not pregnant. Though, the baby fever is more rampant than ever! My sister is due any day now. And, I just found out that Gen (Evil Dognapper, to those who know about the Daisy extortion plot) is having a baby on July 10. I'm privately thrilled for her, because she wanted a baby more than anything, but I also don't think that crazy people should be having babies. They're going to have serious problems in that family. But I was really bummed that nobody told me she was expecting. I chewed Erin out a bit, but all I got back was, I'm too busy, I'm a third year medical student and I’m planning a wedding and I basically don't have time for friends. That makes me sad, too. I give up. I'll never be back in the Chelmsford loop. I'm friends with the best of them still, at least, so I'm content with that. I am finding I wish I had more girlfriends, though. Ashleigh seems so distant now, and so sad. I don't know what to say to her anymore. I feel like I'm finally ready to open up to people (I think Dave has inspired that in me), and I'm ready to trust, but I'm finding that people have very busy lives and no time or energy to put an effort into starting or strengthening friendships. I'm guilty too, I've blown friends off before. But dammit, life is too bloody short!! Who cares if you're career is rocking, if you end up lonely at the end of it all!  Well, I've wasted the morning of work by blogging. Now, back to the number crunching. Frustrating, though, because I have a poem brewing in my head, and I can't take the time to work it out. And the bus home...forget it. Grumble inducing.   Oh yeah, and I've been neglecting my new summer project: MythicalBrit.com.  I've reserved the domain. It's going to be a site for Anglophiles, devoted to all things British! History, and recipes, and current news, crazy links, you name it. I just have to get the ideas down. And a logo. And learn Dreamweaver. Maybe a To-do list is in order...color-coded...NOW it gets exciting, folks!

         Not having telly, I've been feeling a little disconnected from everything that's going on around me. History is being made, right down the street at the Fleetcenter, and I don't have a clue what's going on! Today I had the novel idea of downloading the speeches from the official Convention website, and listening at work. And I'm so glad I did.              urlLink Listen to them here!               Despite the incredibly cheesy intro music, the speeches are so inspiring. Sometimes I feel like I am all alone in my thoughts, that I am the only one who gets angry about our country's shamelessly greedy, dishonest leaders. But hearing the positive messages that are being conveyed from the speakers' podium, and the rousing reception they are getting, I don't feel so alone. I am scared to death of the upcoming election. More than anything, I want to see our relationships with our allies restored. I want   America   to be respected, not ridiculed. I don't want to cringe and try to be invisible when I'm traveling overseas, or pretending to be British so protesters will leave me alone. There is so much hatred in the world, and WE ARE FUELING IT.    We are giving the terrorists every reason to continue their Holy War. Our leaders make it so damn easy for them. Does he not realize this? Are corporate oil interests really the only reason for acting so impulsively, without thinking about the future of our country? We are giving our allies solid reason to abandon us, and what if we need them in the future? We've humiliated Tony Blair, and soured our relationship with the UN - the organization we helped create. God it makes me angry. I pray that the people that voted for Bush the first time around, in (misguided) good conscience, have come to realize that he blatantly misled them. I honestly don't know if Kerry is the right leader for us. I have my own issues with him. But, we have to trust. Trust in our leaders should not be given lightly. I'm wary, I'll confess, the Democrats may have their own agenda. But, in the name of putting an end to the joke that our country has become, and the fear I have of a second term of Evil, I pledge my wholehearted support.            If you care about your country, think about it. And vote for   CHANGE  .

      According to an interview clip on  urlLink Boston.com,    John Cusack has left Boston for Nevada. Michael Moore has also left the city.    Sadness.  But, maybe Webster is still out and about? Still dreary outside, though. Thus negating my celebrity stalking dreams.    But, after all, tomorrow is another day!    Favorite sitings of the day:    Reported:  Early yesterday afternoon about an hour before the convention, I saw  Joe E Tata  (Nat from 90210) in the North End at Ernestos Pizza on Salem Street. I assume he was comparing crusts with the Peach Pit.   by:  Christopher, Boston      Reported:  I just saw  Michael Moore  getting a tour of the Harvard Hockey rink by the zamboni driver--kind of unusual because I didn't think Mr. Moore was a big hockey fan.     by:  Mike, Manchester      Reported:  I saw  John Cusack  entering the Federalist at midnight for a private party last night, the 27th. He told the woman at the door he wanted to wait for his friends, who shortly followed him.     by:  Jackie, Boston      Reported:  All Tuesday night: Governor of New Jersey  James McGreevey  - Limoncello Restaurant in the North End,  John Cusak  the actor - Carmen in the North End, General  Wesley Clark  and wife - Carmen in the North End     by:  Fiorentino, Boston     oh yeah, this week's  People  magazine is going to ROCK!!!

         I went to bed last night with grand schemes and dreams of waking up at the crack of dawn & fumbling my way to the Dunkin Donuts near Fifteen Beacon to wait for John Cusack to make his appearance. Instead, I hit snooze ten million times and woke up to a dreary, drizzly day. So I missed the boat. But, I still plan to hover around either   Newbury   Street   or Faneuil Hall during my lunch break, since those seem to be the hot spots. Funny, though, even if I did spot someone, I don't think I'd have the Chutzpah to actually talk to them!    I'm still kicking myself for not talking to Billy Joel when I saw him on   Newbury Street   a year ago. Do you still get bragging rights if you catch a glimpse, or does it have to be a full-fledged conversation?           Last night's anniversary celebration was very, very nice. We had Tapas at Dali (thought I saw Matthew Perry there, but it wasn't him. I'm just way too wound up now - Steve should never have sent me the link to the celebrity sightings!!) Food and sangria was awesome, but the walk to   Harvard   Square   was even nicer. We browsed in a bookstore and Dave bought me The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Then we walked to Porter. It was such a gorgeous night, and a little disappointing to come home to a very small, very messy, and very stuffy studio apartment. But, I know it's only for a little while longer, and then we'll have a real house. I love having that to look forward to.

      I did it. I sent the ring back to Tom, and now all I feel is.....RELIEF. It's not a burden anymore. There are no remnants of the past to bring into my new life with Dave. I sent it Friday, and received confirmation that it was delivered today. I don't expect to hear from him, and that's okay. I hope now is a good time, and the pain isn't raw anymore. I wonder what he'll do with it? Maybe he'll trade it for a ring to give the person he's meant to be with? Who knows. It's done. And I feel like it was the right thing to do. And I know it made Dave happy, so that's what matters most to me.

         The office is eerily abandoned today. The Democratic convention scared off just about everybody - zero traffic coming in, and the garage across the street is nearly empty - that NEVER happens!! I'm loving it, though. A little calm after a weekend of madness. My cousin's wedding was INSANE. Four hundred Cambodians dancing to weird music, and too much seafood. A good time, until I got a little tipsy and oversensitive and had a big 'ol fight with Dave because he was thinking out loud. Everything was fine, though. We went for a long walk with Daisy when we got home and had a really great talk about how we were brought up in dramatically different ways, and now I think we understand each other much better. And we promised never to go to bed angry. It's so important. Of course, we had to sleep in separate bedrooms, because of the Catholic mum....silly. We could be together ten years, and still have to sleep separately under her roof, just because we don't have those little gold wedding bands....            I'm just not used to fighting. I never fought with Tom, because he refused to. His family just doesn't show emotion, and he would pretend everything was just fine when it really wasn't. It would drive me mad. Sometimes you just need to get it all out, and show anger or hurt or frustration. It's healthy. So, I'm learning new things about people, and it feels really good. I feel like I've been so damn sheltered all my life.             Anyways, yesterday was a great day. Big family breakfast, and hiking in the   Concord   Meadows.    It was so gorgeous, and I just felt so content. I love seeing my family embracing Dave, and seeing how comfortable he is with them. It was also awesome to see Davey (brother, not boyfriend!) being himself again. The last few times we've been together, he was so depressed. This weekend, he was his goofy old self that I sorely missed. We had so many laughs. I got him hooked on Homestarrunner....heh heh (devilish laugh)....then some Bertucci's pizza and a garlic hangover. Yeah, a good day all around.             Today, I was asked to be co-maid of honor for Jen & Eric's wedding. I was completely taken by surprise, and totally flattered! I didn't realize Jen thought so highly of me! Of course I said yes. I've never been Maid of Honor before. I hope I can do it up right, with Kiran! Awesome. It made me smile.            Oh yeah! And one year ago today, I was sneakily roped into a double date by my friend Pardis and her boyfriend Derek, who later ditched me and my "date" at the Red Line...and one year later, I'm now moving in with him. I never would have imagined....here's to getting re-elected for a second term!!!            Feeling a bit long-winded today, but rambling gives me a nice break from number crunching.  It feels a little weird, being in a good mood on a Monday.  At the Harvard T Station, this guy was jamming on  a blues version of "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka. It was incredible. I had to give him my coffee money,  he was just too cool. I was so tempted to just sit and listen, and office be damned....            I wonder if John Kerry will whip out his electric guitar and jam for the Democrats?

         The day is flying by. I didn't even realize it was lunchtime. I've been a little lightheaded since I had my first coffee in ages this morning. Giant iced coffee, from Au Bon Pain. I was so tempted to just stay in   Harvard Square   and read my book in the sunshine ("I Elizabeth" - AWESOME book if you're into historical fiction). But, I chose the responsible path. I'm getting a lot done today, though. Having earphones keeps the annoyances down to a minimum - why didn't I think of this before? Anyways, I digress. I've been lightheaded, not an unpleasurable sensation, I actually really enjoy a nice little coffee buzz, but not great for getting work done.            Another stressful   Chelmsford   weekend coming up. Cousin's wedding tomorrow (I barely know him, so it's a little weird, but it makes Mum happy. So we go.) My brother Dave is back in town from   Colorado  , for who knows how long, so we're celebrating his birthday on Sunday. I'm a little bummed, only because boyfriend Dave and I had planned on celebrating our one year of togetherness on Monday, which means salon cleaning on Sunday. Now, because of brother Dave's birthday party, salon takes place on Monday and anniversary gets bumped. What can you do, it's family. And, I haven't seen Dave (brother) in about a year. So it'll be cool.             Dave just told me that he will be Best Man for Eric, along with Tom! I'm psyched for him. I'm not sure how it'll work out with two best men, but hell, you can do anything you want on your wedding day, right?! Just so long as I get to dance with Dave, and nobody else!! I love weddings. Not the one tomorrow night, particularly, but weddings with lots and lots of friends. I can't wait for my own - just to have everybody that means something to me in one room, partying it up!             Working hard today. But, I've got to take a break for errands - wedding card, Dave birthday present, other Dave anniversary present. Oi! It's all too much! There goes my bloody paycheck!!!

         I just realized that, had I stayed with Tom, four days ago would have been my first anniversary as a married woman. Weird, unsettling thought. What makes it weird, I think, is that I don't feel particularly sad about it, but I feel like I should. I'm more relieved that I didn't take that path with someone I wasn't in love with. I'm far more excited about celebrating my one year of togetherness with Dave on Monday. No regrets. I would have been miserable married to Tom, and would have made him miserable too. I wonder if he's fallen in love yet? I'll always wonder. We haven't talked since the car accident legal mess, and that's fine with me. I have yet to send the ring    back, not because I'm holding onto it but because I'm lazy and just haven't dragged my arse to FedEx to send it off. It's been sitting in a drawer in my desk at work. Ugh, the administration....but that will bring some relief, too. I promised Dave I wouldn't bring it to the new house, and I'm going to keep that promise.           Oh yeah, and I had another Beth nightmare, I guess because Dave and I were talking last night about her being so weird when I moved in, and forbidding me to put any of my personal stuff in the common areas. In my dream, she was livid because I asked her for the money she owed me, and screamed at me. Ashleigh was there, trying to referee. I told Beth I just didn't like being there, and I wanted to leave immediately.    She lunged at me, and punched me in the arse, so I punched her in the head and bloodied her head! Then, all her weird friends came out of nowhere. I tried to run around, gathering my stuff so I could leave then and there, and they were making it really difficult for me. Then, it wasn't my apartment anymore, but someone else's, and it turned into my secret society of humans dream.    That was disturbing too, but a little too funky and hard to describe here. It's the anxiety of moving, methinks. I just want to get it over with, and do the nesting!

                             Seduced by the world's most mournful violin    I stumbled through the stillness of mid-summer's night    Clinging to the vision of the one I loved most    Reaching the cliff's edge, I faltered.    The music grew fainter, and stopped.    Confronted by chaotic waves, gaze fixed angrily towards the East  Abandoned by the music that drew me, embraced me.    Reminded me of him.    The stillness recedes, fumes of fury invade.    Ocean's spray mingled with tears    I crumble.                                 A universe of time drifts by.    My body glacier-cold, unmoving, unwanted    Until, a solitary hesitant note, drifting, grows stronger    Fury abates, life revived by the lonely melody    The waves soothed, awaiting the return to melancholy,     But the song transforms, euphoric now    Joined by an orchestra of ethereal voices    Infusing me with desire to laugh, to live, to forget the cold    Wordlessly, he appears beside me, inviting me to dance    Reunited in a mad, blissful tarantella    I find my soul again.

      I had a feeling it was heading this way....    Basically, everything I've written/worked on for the website content has been overridden by Boss Man and I've wasted many hours of my time trying to actually put my bachelor's degree to use to the benefit of the company. If he wants a technical website, fine. There is no reason La Capra should be exempt from the principles of public relations, but there it is. It's a losing battle - he's going to exercise his powers of dictatorship, no matter what I say.  I'm turning my attention to my other baby, my market statistics product. At least with this group, I am much more comfortable speaking up and demonstrating that I actually do know what I'm talking about once in a while.  You know, so much of what I do here is behind the scenes. They would fall apart if I left. They may not realize it right now.          And with that, I'm done with bitching about work. This time, I PROMISE. This is meant to be a FUN blog. And from this point on, it will be nothing BUT.           But it doesn't negate the desire for Vino tonight! And, I've got Isla's Faerie Tale to work on. I think I will feel better about the job once school starts, and I will be immersed in History, swamped with (enjoyable) homework, and will probably welcome the mindlessness of being here.

       I'm feeling much less bitchy now. I escaped to Post Office Square to be barefoot and snooze in the sun. Actually, today is a litte bit o' fun, because I'm getting creative with the website content. I just realized something - What are the chooches going to do when I control the website, and can post anything I want on it? I never thought of that until just now. Hell yeah! It's weird, though. I've totally lost my PR skills. I'm just staring at the blank screen and the only words that fall out of my keyboard are total CRAP. Where is the inspiration, the persuasion, the sneaky desire to sway people's emotions? I think it's just boring content. I have this faerie tale in my head, and there's just not enough room in there for dull as dirt press releases, too. Oi. Life is hard, isn't it?

      I am so sick and tired of being the coordinator and go-between in this stupid branding project. I want to be the  creative  one, and I just can't make myself heard. I give up. I just don't want to do it anymore. My boss is so hard to talk to. And he feels like he has to take everything on, and be the primary content editor of the site, when he really has no clue about marketing. Yes, he has the engineering know-how, but it doesn't mean he is the only one that can write content.     I'm done. My mind is elsewhere, and I just don't care anymore. And, D'oh! It's only Tuesday! Oi!    Venting feels pretty damn good, though.    Last night, I watched  Insomnia  with Dave. It was a little unsettling to see this guy suffer the altered reality and constant anxiety of sleeplessness. I remember my insomniac days so vividly (of course, the major difference between me and Al Pacino's character is, I didn't kill somebody!). I thought I would never find my personality again. I thought I was all alone in my discomfort. I thought I would never stop crying. I can't remember when I was able to sleep again, when I was able to find myself. It must have been so gradual. Now, it feels like I was walking through a dreamworld. I NEVER want to go back there again. I get a major headache from just thinking about it.     Life is good, now.  And I'm so incredibly grateful.

         Stress-less proposal day turned into stress-full weekend. I majorly screwed up on the FedEx delivery, and we could have lost the job because of it. But, they did in fact receive the electronic version Friday, before the deadline, and that was acceptable to the potential client. BIG RELIEF. It was on my mind all weekend, and I thought my job might be on the line. As much as I bitch about my situation, I am really not ready to start a job hunt for real, especially with school right around the corner. There's just too much going on right now. Dave is settling into his new job, and it's awesome to see him come home in a good mood. Almost unreal. Soon, we'll be in the new house. I'm a little stressed about the actual move, and dealing with the roommate issues, but once we're in the house all will be good. I've been mentally decorating already....            Weekend was okay. Relaxing, mostly - lots of much-needed sleep. We nixed the camping trip because of the forecast for   New Hampshire  , and I got screwed by the reservation company. I paid $70 to reserve two sites, and got a grand refund of.....$7. I was LIVID. I almost would have preferred sitting in a wet tent all weekend. Saturday was the FedEx fiasco, but Dave did a wonderful job of taking my mind off it with my favorite  urlLink Homestarrunner  cartoons. (Just the claps!)              Today, uneventful thus far. Sorted out the proposal madness, so all is good, but now I’m trying to be the Star Employee of the Week. Which is really hard to do, when I'm really feeling more and more discontent. I don't understand why it's so bloody hard to find a job doing something you love to do. Almost everyone I know is on a totally different path than they set out on, a path they really wanted. I'm thrilled for Dave, he's finally doing the programming that he's been doing for fun anyway! I guess I'll have to be patient until I have my History degree and can teach. Right now, it feels so very far away....             But enough whinging. That's all I've been doing lately, when I'm actually incredibly grateful for the good fortune in my life at the moment. I almost don't trust it, I feel like something bad is just lurking around the corner. But maybe not. Maybe we should all just enjoy the present.      Because you know what? Nothing matters when we're dancing.....

      Secrets to a Stress-Free Double Proposal Madness Day:  1. Hijack workmate's earphones, and plug into soothing Celtic music. 2. Drink copious amounts of Camomile tea 3. Introduce "Office Bitch Jo" to the office, and NAG NAG NAG!!! (but, do it with a smile)  Worked like a charm. I think because I flipped out last proposal day, everyone went out of their way to cooperate this time, and get the pieces to me early for pre-production. Like stepping on eggshells. I loved it...and I sent a big thank you to everyone involved, for making it so smooth and easy. You GOTTA encourage the chooches. I even went home at a decent hour, in a good mood. Proposal days don't always have to be maddening!  but, solutions have their consequences. Now, I'm feeling this inexplicable longing for Ireland (yes, stronger than the Salt Craving)....and I must to learn the fiddle. I don't mind being at work today. It's quiet, and I'm feeling creative. Of course, I'd rather be working on my website, which I haven't done in quite some time. Oi. Camping won't happen, outlook not so good for New Hampshire, and I got screwed by the reservations. I paid about $75 for two sites for two nights, and my total refund is....$7. DON'T EVER USE RESERVEAMERICA.COM FOR CAMPING RESERVATIONS. The policy was posted on the site, but was confusing as hell. And the guy I talked to was an arse. Anyways, the sun is out here, so maybe we can go somewhere local. I'm dying to escape the city, just for a little bit.  Today's Random News Blurbs:  This is fascinating. If you're an astronomy nerd like me, check this out:  urlLink Stephen Hawking Changes his Mind about Black Holes   The Next American Idol? There's hope!  urlLink AI Raises Age Limit from 26 to 28   And, watch out for shady U2 bootlegs:  urlLink U2 CD Stolen in Nice   Is it just me, or is Blogger completely wacked out lately?

      Shitty day, all around. Some arsehole tried to rub my leg on the T this morning, and that sparked the irritability.  All day, people were having very LOUD conversations around my desk, and blatantly ignoring my ear-plugging plea to please just go away. I actually had to get some work done today, so I won't get stuck there at crazy hours tomorrow. I guess it'll happen anyway. Today, I realized just how fuckng bored I am with my job, and just how little people value my intelligence. Then, this afternoon, I found out Gen had her baby. (a week ago - again, nobody bothered to tell me, I had to write to Amity to find out) So, new baby. Yay, right? No. It just made me sad. I looked at the pictures Amity sent me, and I burst into tears. I would have been there, if she weren't such a selfish, irrational creature. I miss my best friend. I don't understand what she did to me or why, and now I'm cut out of her life at her happiest moment. And the crowning moment of my day, Dave just called, he missed his train and will be in at 10:30. We haven't had an evening alone together since, like, last Thursday, so we had big plans for steaks, wine, and a game of Settlers, then an episode of Six Feet Under. I miss him. I just hate how everythiing happens at once, always. Good things, and bad things. This is me, being a whiner, I know, but I don't care. I feel like shit. Maybe I'll just throw the steaks back in the freezer and sleep straight through till tomorrow, and start over from scratch.   Or, there's Roller Coaster Tycoon and Vino.......

      This is amazing. E! Online's headline: "Beatles for Sale, Cheap." Read it:   urlLink E! Online    urlLink BBC News      Now why do these things never happen to me? I would NEVER sell this treasure trove. I would use it to try to meet Paul McCartney, maybe, or give it to the Beatles museum in Liverpool, but I would never sell it to random internet weirdos. This guy has no sense of the sacred.  And what in tarnation were they doing in Australia?!

      Just got back from my very first political rally. It was so much fun! I was surprised that Kerry was such a good public speaker. He really knows how to get people fired up, without resorting to being negative towards He-who-must-not-be-named.  In fact, it was an incredibly positive message. And I don't know what my mum is talking about - his wife had the microphone for a bit, and she was strong, and eloquent, and dignified. She marched against apartheid in South Africa. I don't believe First Ladies have to sit quietly in the background and behave themselves. She's a strong person, and shouldn't have to be anything other than herself. I think she's an asset to Kerry. I seriously doubt Mum has ever heard or seen her in action, and again, it saddens me that she is so quick to judge, based on other peoples' opinions.  I'm so fired up now. I am scared for our country, and incrediblyapprehensive about the November election. It's time for a change. I'm not completely won over by the Democrats' choice, I'm still a little mad at Kerry for voting for war, then changing his tune, but I do believe he will be a positive force. And, his Vice-President is quite the dish.....  Oh yeah, and for those of you who didn't realize that John Kerry and Inspector Gadget are really one and the same, here's all the proof you'll need:   urlLink Kerry/Gadget Theory

      My mum makes me sad.   We're chatting amiably while I'm crunching numbers at work. Then she says, "Oh, I have something to tell you. I talked to Marjorie across the street, and she says that Michael Moore hates America, and everything in his movie is a lie." Okay, I've been prepared for this. I ask her where this information came from, and she says "the television."  "Okay, do you know which channel?" "It was a news channel." "Was it...Fox News?" "Yes, I think so."  Oh Ma.....don't trust everything you hear! She didn't realize that Fox is blatantly right-wing, and can be considered propaganda every bit as much as Michael Moore's movie (which I freely admit is propaganda - it's one-sided, but still truthful. Bush and his shady oil cronies speak for themselves - they really don't need much spin). Michael Moore does not hate America. If everyone saw this movie for themselves, instead of being told what to think by the right-wing spin doctors, then they have a right to an opinion. But without seeing the movie....I don't think she even knows about the Patriot Act, or the covering up of Bush's National Guard Records. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNBIASED, OBJECTIVE MEDIA TODAY.	It simply doesn't exist. The facts are all out there - Michael Moore just packaged them very dramatically for the people that don't seek the truth for themselves. I'm so fired up. It makes me sad, how easily she's influenced by the television, and neighbor Marjorie.   Michael Moore hates the leaders of America. He is a bold, crazy man, and very extreme, but he is a patriot who is doing what he can to get the shadiness out in the open. It's the leaders who don't care about America. They care about their precious oil connections. Does nobody see this?!?!

      So damned tired. Up late, playing Settlers of Catan. GREAT game, but it's impossible to stop playing. Tired, and I think...a little bit crazy. I have this mad desire for salt, and lots of it. I'm having visions of margaritas, with extra salty rims, salted watermelon, tortilla chips with salted salsa, and McDonald's French fries, and salt bagels from Finagle.....the list is endless. Weird, I know.  Marc would say it falls into the "not quite right" category. But hell, sanity is overrated anyway.  After last night's Six Feet Under, I had to look up the definition of Borderline Personality. Sad, considering I was a Psych major. I think it's pretty much a damn made up disorder - the symptoms describe me, and just about everybody I know, in some way. Damn DSM-IV is a bloody scam based on conjecture, false reasoning and poorly designed experiments in controlled environments that bear absolutely no relevance to the way people actually think and behave. Now I'm remembering why I didn't pursue the psychology path. It got me too fired up. Why don't they just add Salt Addiction to the bloody manual, seems to me it makes about as much sense as including PMS.  Not a bad day, though, overall. It's Dave's last day at Crappy Tech. We're going out for drinks with his workmates tonight, as a little send-off. I really just want to get home to play Settlers. And eat salt.   Encouragement...and words of praise from someone I normally don't interact with at work, one of the chooches who usually drives me nuts, so that was nice. Discouragement.....because I worked really hard on three ideas for the homepage content for the Boss, and haven't heard a single comment from him. I submitted it yesterday morning, and not one word have I heard. Constant frustration around here. Can't wait for those drinks tonight...and now, possibly a beach day with Jen & Eric on Sunday, which would be SO NICE. Nothing is more relaxing to me than dozing in the sun with a cheesy celebrity worship magazine and some mellow friends. Ooops....I just remembered my lack of swimming gear, since my favorite swimsuit shrunk down to nothing in the dryer and became underwear last week. Maybe time for an emergency trip to H&M?  oh yeah, and I discovered fun new shady way to blog. Draft it up as an e-mail, then covertly copy and paste. I love being a shady cat.

      Now that Dave is career bound in his new job, I've lost my e-mail buddy! I'll have to find a new way to slack at work, that doesn't involved incessant rambling e-mails. Rambling to the blog is hard, because it's too obvious. Maybe I should actually buckle down and do real work? Nah. Maybe it'll give us more to talk about at the end of the day. But then, we've never really suffered for that (my anxiety-ridden days of wondering when we're going to run out of words are gone - I just don't see it happening. It's a very, very good thing!). I just miss 'im! 'twas a lonely ride on the bus this morning! And it's only Day One!!! AAAHHH!!! I'm dying to know how everything is going, and what his new workmates are like. The Suspense!   But, strangely calm. After a very bad start to the work week, things are okay again. I flipped out a little on Tuesday, for good reason, and was near tears. So, yesterday and today, everyone stayed clear of me and I actually had some peace and quiet to get interesting work done. That's a rarity, that is. Office Bitch Jo is here to stay. No more suffering silently. People will just keep taking advantage of me.   I can't wait to get home tonight. We got the new Six Feet Under DVD - marathon imminent!! And the crazy Settlers of Catan card game! There's our weekend right there. Yeah, we're nerds. And proud. I've never been the party girl, I'd rather settle in for the evening with a bottle of wine and a board game. Simple. Do I really give off the aura of a party girl? People don't seem to believe me when I say I'm not one. I can't afford to be, anyway. Money is tight at the moment, and it's got me down. We've got a big deposit coming up in August, and I'm dipping into my savings just to cover this damn camping trip that is already costing more than I have. My discover card is maxed. I HATE this, being a slave to the dollars. I haven't been bad with money. I make all my credit card and loan payments, then I have nothing left at the end. And I have to wait one month until my next paycheck, and do it all again. Granted, last weekend was unexpectedly very pricey. Don't EVER get the family style meal at Vinny T's. It's a rip-off. I did NOT eat $20 worth of food. Of course, I would have been guilted into it anyway, because you can't be the only one who rebels against the family. But man, it's an expensive family to be a part of! So, a bit of stress. Dave tells me not to worry, that we were able to scrape up the first deposit and we can do it again. We're a team. And I know he's right. It just sucks, when we're trying to save for a car, and a trip to England to see the Munchkins, and we just can't seem to get ahead.....this camping trip better be pretty damn relaxing, I'll tell you!  It's also exhausting to have such an action-packed summer. Always something going on, and most of it I feel obligated to, rather than excited about. I was so looking forward to peacefulness, before school madness starts in September (the REAL stress will begin....we'll see if I can keep my tenuous hold on sanity. I'm a little worried about that). And I'm itching to get into the new house, to start my life with Dave. I've started packing already. I can't help it! I want it so bad I can almost taste it.   I started a new poem, I may give it to Dave for our anniversary, but it's turning out a little too girly. I might have to brainstorm an alternative gift for him. I have the basic story, tonight I will outline it, and determine if it is too girly to give him. If it is I won't give it to him, I'll probably post it. I need to get writing again, before the summer is over and I'm buried in history books again.

      This is a movie that every voter needs to see before November rolls around.  Blatant propaganda, yes, but if it gets people fired up, then God bless 'im. Michael Moore created a movie that is simultaneously emotionally draining and incrediby entertaining. It really makes you think....how did this country's leaders get to be so damned shady?! I have the same complaint I had about Bowling for Columbine, that Moore's approach is a little bit scattered and rather than stick to one or two themes and really exploring them, he touches on many, many themes and leaves you wanting to know more details. Some themes are very unsettling....pictures of very young, very innocent victims of our aggression in Iraq. Some of the background of Bush and his oil cronies was very enlightening. If you know me fairly well, you already know how I feel about our current administration. This movie only served to strengthen those feelings.  Now, if I post this, I will probably be a target for the FBI through some random clause in the Patriot Act (another theme that every voter needs to know about). but you know what? It's still a free country. I'll write it, I'll post it, and I will do what I can to get people to see this movie. And come election time, if we find ourselves gearing up for another four years under the current administration.....I'll be on the first plane to the British Virgin Islands. And Michael Moore, you're a bold, crazy man. I hope you get your second Oscar.  Oh, and on a related note, Michael Moore gave the okay to illegally download this movie, so long as you don't try to profit off his labor. Score another one against the Establishnment!!!!

      'tis a tasty summer beverage. It's so nice to have nothing that I have to get done, other than finish the beer on the table next to me. I am feeling so much better at work. I decided yesterday that I wasn't going to wallow in my misery, that I'm going to become Office Bitch Jo and not take no for an answer. I'm going to prove myself if it kills me. I sent a detailed memo to my boss, outlining my ideas for the website, and he actually considered and accepted them. That felt SO GOOD, and redeeming. Now I have to follow through, which unfortunatly means homework, but I'll do what it takes to make it bearable to remain there until I leave for my career in history.  Today, Dave and I took Daisy to Petco for birthday presents. We tried out about a million beds, and took home a lovely green one. She's curled up in it now -  adorable .  It's not her birthday proper until July 15, but she doesn't know that. She got a new lead, a brush, henna shampoo for red fur (although nothing works as well for her color as the lovely tomato juice bath she got after the skunk encounter in Chelmsford) and an assortment of bones and rawhides hand-picked by Dave. The dog is bloody spoiled. The bed was important, though. Beth's kitty soiled her other one, which was pretty ugly anyway. Now she has a new bed for a new house, and a new beginning. I feel like we're a little family, Dave and Daisy and I. yeah, that's incrediby cheesy. And I honestly don't care, because I went through hell to get here, and I'm lovin it!!!!  I had a fantastic dream last night, in which I met Isla. She was so beautiful. Paris and Yazzy were in it too, but I've met them, and I've never met Isla. It was pretty special. I'm dying to meet the newest Munchkin.  No definite plans for the 4th, tentatively the Chelmsford festivities with Jen & Ben. who knows. I'm thoroughly enjoying the lazy commitment-free weekend. It'll be a rare occurrence once school starts.

      I feel much calmer. I escaped to Post Office Square yesterday after my mad rant and meditated for a bit. Much, much better. Still frustrated, but I'm forcing myself to seek more creative avenues to make it all a bit more interesting. Dave was wonderful last night, he knew I was super grumbly so he bought me some wine and listened so patiently while I vented. And he made chicken wings. And we made out a little. Too much information? sorry. But he really has a way to take my grumbles away, and it turned into a really nice evening. I love sitting down to a proper dinner with him. No TV, just talking.   I forgot to mention Ladies' Night the other night. I had a really good time with Jen and Kiran, and am getting to know them a little bit more each time we hang out. We had ribs, and some laughs, always a good thing. I showed them the house, with much pride. I think Jen is just as excited about it as Dave and I are! That was cute to see. It's funny, because I've always sort of resisted making new friends, and tend to cling to the old ones (very old - Jenny and I go back to nursery school!). I guess people can change. I'm having fun, anyway.   speaking of change - yesterday I went home and did some preliminary packing & tossing of junk. It felt good. I saw Beth for the first time since....the night of the Friends finale, I think? She's moving to Cali to be with her Death Cab boytoy. A bold move, but probably good for her. She's bored here in Boston, and has had some sadness. Thought L.A. sounds like a pretty bizarro place....anyways, I retrieved "the ring." today, it goes out to Tom, provided I have the time to escape somewhere to put the package together and write him a note. And then, that's it. Closure. Last night, I threw out some of his old letters to me, and I didn't feel sad. Now is the right time. Before, during my last move, the pain was still a little too raw to deal with this stuff, but now I'm focused on the future. Absolutely no regrets.  that's all for now. I'm still mostly calm, but a little nervous about today's product development meeting, because I fear that management is going to take over my baby, the project I've been slaving over for the past six months or so.

         I've barely had ten seconds to myself to breathe deeply this week. Chaos!! I think I could much better serve this company by learning to play the harp, and then parking in the big open area, playing my sweet music, and minimizing the overwrought stress levels of everybody else. 'tis the dream. Speaking of dreams, I watched '  Elizabeth  ' the other night (best movie ever!!!) after I finished my book 'I, Elizabeth,' which horribly embarrassed me because I started crying on the T because, in the book, Robin died. Anyways, I digress. I dreamt that night that Dave and I lived in Elizabethan times, and I called him 'My Lord,' and we danced a very silly dance to a lute. Then, I woke up, but the dream lingered and was still fading in my mind even though I was awake. I turned and saw Dave sleeping next to me, and got all mushy, and actually said 'oh, my Lord!' out loud. Would have been acutely embarrassing, but he was asleep, thank goodness.  Oh, to be Queen of a lovely, small country. I would LOVE to wear those fancy Tudor full-skirted, cleavage baring ball gowns every day....that would rock. Silly, I know.          The move is creeping up on us. Two and a half weeks to go....the mound of boxes I've been saving up in the copy room is starting to annoy people who trip over it. I guess I'd better get them the hell out at some point. Mostly uneventful week, thus far. I ended up not going to  Erin 's bridal shower, but instead had a fantastic day outside with the boyfriend and the puppy. We threw sticks in the pond and she cleaned them out for us. Then, a fantastic mexicano feast, and much vino. 'twas a wonderfully rare, properly relaxing weekend.            Minor skirmish at work. It's funny, all my disappointment and frustration and anger that has been boiling up over the past few months have sort of mestasticized on one difficult person, so long as I avoid him my good mood can stay intact. I was fully annoyed, though. Basically, he made left me feeling like he was really angry - and by angry, I mean red in the face, steam coming out of the ears LIVID - at me for a communication breakdown between himself and Dan, the boss. Nothing whatsoever to do with me. What got me riled, is that Doug left me with the feeling that I had done something wrong, and that he was angry with me. He was very unclear, tactless, and it's just another example of how he doesn't know how to deal with people and how good he is at making people (well, me!) feel very insignificant. Just another item for my running tally. Dan was very cool, though. He told me Doug was only upset with the situation, and not to read anything more into it. Fine, because I did nothing wrong. But I'm collecting the stories, and will get my points across in time. All in good time, yeah? I'm much calmer this week, thank goodness, so when it's time to talk to management I can make some sense and not be overly emotional.           I got the okay from the Boss for the Wednesday afternoon French Revolution class, which means I get a break from the madness smack in the middle of the week. Of course, I'll be here till all hours on the other days to make up for it, but this was the class I really wanted. So yeah, Boss is on my good side this week. Awesome. So, now I can pick up the book i reserved and start reading ahead. God, I'm a bloody NERD...!!!!           On a totally random note, you know how usually when you order iced coffee, they fill the cup up with so much ice you really only get a tablespoon of coffee? I found a nearby Au Bon Pain where you get your own iced coffee, like a soda fountain, and put in as much or as little ice as you want. So you get your $1.56 worth of iced coffee and a MAJOR coffee buzz. Best and worst discovery I've ever made.    Mum left for England today, to hang with the baby. I am so envious......

         About  Erin 's bridal shower. I finally got an e-mail from Erin's sister, Tara, about Sunday's shower. I'm not too keen to go, to be honest. I don't like feeling like an afterthought. But, I'm not sure how to decline politely, when I'm really fired up about her thoughtlessness. Oh, the politics of weddings!!! Life is so difficult!!! I really do want to go, because I want to see her, but still...I have some pride. And to be thrown into the mix three days before the shower....it just stings a little. And I don't understand it, because we have always gotten along and never really had a falling-out. I did have to (regretfully) un-ask her to be a bridesmaid back in the days of wedding planning, because I honestly felt she wasn't at all interested in the role, and I could probably have done that with a little more tact. But we've talked since then, and everything seems fine. I can only really think of Genevieve's influence. No matter what  Erin  says, Gen has probably poisoned her mind against me. I don't think it's simple paranoia - I know Gen, and I know how she twists things and blatantly lies. I just don't think it's fair that whatever twisted reality she lives in, it precludes me from a friendship with someone I knew long before she came along. I guess it would be pretty uncomfortable, anyway, to hang out with complete strangers and Genevieve. Undecided....but I will probably decline.          All  bitterness aside, work is a teeny bit better. I had a chat with a workmate, and it felt really good to get everything off my chest. He suggested meeting with the management, and arming myself with solid, factual examples to explain my frustrations. He gave me a little insight into the way they manage, and agreed that their management styles (and people skills) leave a lot to be desired. He said it's probably in my best interests to work this out, rather than leave, because I would take a pay cut elsewhere. That's all well and good, but if I don't see any changes, then I have no problem with taking off. I'm actually dreading meeting with them, though I see no other way. They are not my favorite people. They intimidate me, and make me lose my powers of coherent speech.    Just having filled someone in on my frustrations, though, did a world of good. At my meditation class the other night, my thoughts were bombarded by the chooches and their thoughtless ways, and I felt violated. Why should they have control over my peaceful moments? I was getting angry, and found it harder and harder to be calm and focused. Now, after unloading my mind, I can focus without the intrusion. So all is good, for now, at least in that sphere.         Reading Jen's blog yesterday about Office Anthropology (I think she's invented a new field!) made so much sense. My desk is insanely strewn with Jo relics - framed photos (x4) of Dave & Daisy &amp; myself (my little family!), and a couple random ones of Maddie; Paul McCartney figurine (cartoon Paul, from Yellow Submarine); J.W. Waterhouse wall calendar; Ireland desk calendar; E.T. figurine; and a Buddha figurine. What does it all mean? I love toys, fine art, and I long for serenity and   Ireland  . Maybe I shouldn't be so obvious. Maybe I should create a new persona at work. Maybe I should be dark, and mysterious, and brooding. Like Aragorn. I'll litter my desk with random weird things - crystal balls, and shrunken heads, and whatnot. Mortar and pestles and bubbling cauldrons. Would anybody even notice? Probably not.             Time for a walk, methinks.

       From the Wikipedia  urlLink (www.wikipedia.org):      Voldemort's real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle (appropriate since his name is indeed a  urlLink riddle ); in the  urlLink second book  he explains that Voldemort is derived from an  urlLink anagram  of his name:      TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE = I AM LORD VOLDEMORT      In translated versions of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Voldemort's true name is changed to accommodate the anagram:              urlLink Czech     TOM ROJVOL RADDLE = JÁ LORD VOLDEMORT         urlLink Danish     ROMEO G DETLEV JR = JEG ER VOLDEMORT         urlLink Dutch     MARTEN ASMODOM VILIJN = MIJN NAAM IS VOLDEMORT         urlLink Finnish     TOM LOMEN VALEDRO = MA OLEN VOLDEMORT         urlLink French     TOM ELVIS JEDUSOR = JE SUIS VOLDEMORT         urlLink German     TOM VORLOST RIDDLE = IST LORD VOLDEMORT         urlLink Greek     ANTON MORVOL HERT = ARHON VOLDEMORT ("NT" in Greek can be pronounced as "D")         urlLink Hebrew     TOM VANDROLO RIDDLE = ANI LORD VOLDEMORT (Hebrew spelling--טום ואנדרולו רידל = אני לורד וולדמורט)         urlLink Hungarian     TOM ROWLE DENEM = NEVEM VOLDEMORT (My name's Voldemort)         urlLink Italian     TOM ORVOLOSON RIDDLE = SONO IO LORD VOLDEMORT         urlLink Norwegian     TOM DRODELO VENSTER = VOLDEMORT DEN STORE         urlLink Portuguese     TOM SERVOLEO RIDDLE = EIS LORD VOLDEMORT (Here's Lord Voldemort)         urlLink Spanish     TOM SORVOLO RYDDLE = SOY LORD VOLDEMORT         urlLink Swedish     TOM GUS MERVOLO DOLDER = EGO SUM LORD VOLDEMORT

       urlLink Ralph Fiennes Cast as Lord Voldemort     Fantastic casting. The guy is an amazing actor, and plays evil really well (check out his masochistic death camp commander in Schindler's List. Chilling.). But, the man is too damn sexy to be Voldemort! You can't just cover up that smoldering specimen of manhood with ghoulish makeup. It's all wrong. He is incredibly adaptable, though. He wasn't so pretty in Red Dragon.    Dave suggested John Malkovich as Voldemort, and I thought it was brilliant. There's definitely some evil in that man. Someone else suggested Kevin Spacey, which I don't see at all. He comes across as just a really nice guy, and it's hard to get past that. It would be like casting Tom Hanks as a Nazi - just wouldn't work.       But, the speculation has ended. Voldemort is cast, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will hit our screens in November 2005. If it's even half as ridiculously awesome as the last Harry Potter movie, then...the anticipation will kill me!           Speaking of anticipation, when the hell is the third season of Six Feet Under out on DVD? I'm having serious withdrawal symptoms.....     urlLink    Ralph Fiennes as Nazi Commandant Amon Goeth  urlLink

      Last night, I dreamt that both Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears were my sisters - half sisters, or step-sisters, or something. Britney was sweet, but dumb as rocks, and Christina was a real bitch. We lived in my parents house. Another sister was in the hospital having a baby, and we had to get there but had no gas in the car. Christina refused to go because she was too busy making out with her boyfriend. I had History homework to do but I offered to go anyway, and Britney came with me. We got into an old brown, rusty convertible - hideous. But, I was beaming with pride to be riding in any convertible with Britney, because I wasn't just her sister, I was a huge fan. So we filled up on gas and came back to pick up Christina. At the hospital, we made a list of all the items the baby would need, and Christina insisted we include perfume on the list. I tried, patiently, to explain to her that babies don't actually wear perfume, that they don't need to because they have a special 'baby smell' instead. She got fired up at that, and started screaming and swearing at me. She lost her shite! So I walked away. And the next thing I know, we're at a water slide park. I cut in front of Christina in line, because she's still ranting and raving at me, and I took off down the slide.  The End.   urlLink    My Sisters!!!  urlLink

              Feeling a little better today, so long as I don't have to interact with insensitive bastard, but I still want to talk to someone. I feel like this company will never improve if they don't even realize what horrible managers they are. Who to talk to, I don't know. I have three options, none of them particularly appealing. But it's got to be done.            I absolutely cannot wait for school to start. It'll be madness, no doubt, juggling two classes, a five-hour a week research assistantship, and full-time work. Oi!!! But, I'll be learning the stuff I love. This semester, it'll be the French Revolution and Agrarian Societies. I'm hoping to get into the Teaching Assistant program for next year, if it's enough to live off of I'll just quit work. Maybe live off my Sugar Daddy programmer. Yeah! Last night he was the coolest. I was home cooking up flavor lab steaks while he was at job #2, and I blew a fuse. Total darkness, and I don't have a clue how to fix that stuff. Flavor Lab Interruptus. Two terrible marinade attempts later, I just gave up. Sucky day, all around. I so badly wanted to have the lights back up, and a steak dinner ready to surprise Dave when he got home. It was so frustrating. So he came home, attempted to fix the lights, ran (literarlly - we're carless!) to Stop & Shop, got the wrong size fuse, ran back to Stop &amp; Shop, and returned with.....roses. He's AMAZING. By all means, he should have been the grumbliest. And old Dave (pre-programming job) would have been the grumbliest. But last night he said, and this just made me melt, that this is the best month of his life, with the new job and moving in with me. Ahhh...can't stop the blushing.....            I was also feeling badly about  Erin 's wedding shower. It's supposed to be this weekend, and I haven't seen an invite yet. Now why the hell would you tell someone about it, and tell them they're getting an invite, and then not send it? Of course, it's totally something she would pull. But I mean, it's much more hurtful to expect an invitation, and not get one, than to just not get one. Why the hell bother to even tell me about it?!?! I'm not entirely sure I want to go. She hasn't been the greatest friend. But at the same time, I do want to show Evil Dognapper (if she's there) that she doesn't have any control in my life, and that I'm not going to stay away from mutual friends just because she'll be there. Other than that, I just really miss  Erin ! Even though she's a total flake, when we're together we always have fun. So, I might go. Decision paralysis. If I get an invite this week, I sort of feel like an afterthought.             But, all is good. I have roses!! I wanted to take them to work so I could gaze at them all day, but I'm not sure they would have survived the trip.            Girly night has been pre-empted by an imminent baby arrival (no, not one of the gang! not yet!) So, tonight, meditation and job hunting. Life improvement imminent!!!

      Same old shit. I honestly don't think the bastard has  any feelings. I need to get out of here. Nothing will change. It will take me saying, I'm leaving the company, and this is why. See ya, Chooches. And then they'll say what? We had no idea! No, of course you didn't, because you can't see what goes on right in front of you in your own company. I overheard Doug tell Leslie before she left, that he wanted to see me "step up" in my new position. Well, I've tried, and I get shot down every bloody time. So why bother? I want to tell him off SO BAD. But, he is incredibly intimidating to me and I'd rather just not talk to him at all. There's nobody that I CAN talk to, really. Elaine can't do much, and she's only in a couple days a week anyway. Jonathan would probably listen, and he's a pretty good mediator, but I just don't like him all that much. Last resort, methinks. As soon as Jamie is back from lunch I'm going for a looooooooong walk to cool off. Maybe I can brainstorm some way to bring up these sort of issues at the retreat?  I know I tend to take things too personally and I know this is not an overt attack on me or my intelligence, really, but it's the sheer thoughtlessness of so many people around here that really gets to me.  I was in a fine ol' mood only moments ago....

      Last word on the Democratic National Convention: I am SO PROUD to call myself, for the first time,  a Boston Democrat at this moment in time. The speakers at the DNC were dignified, inspiring, and optimistic, and didn't resort to blatant Bush-bashing.  Kerry has revealed that he is the stronger leader, and doesn't need to coast on mudslinging to prove his points.  Pack your bags, Bush.   Oi, so much going on this weekend.       Friday's Shakespeare on the Common was sort of a bust. Unfortunately, it really did turn out to be Much Ado About Nothing. The gang got antsy, and just couldn't get into it, I guess. Shakespeare isn't for everybody. Our triple date ended up being just me and Dave. We left during the second act. Because it was just too hard to follow. Confusing story to begin with, and we were so far away, all the characters looked the same, and we couldn't tell who was speaking, and who was who. And craning just to see the action in the sea of people, it all got to be too much. I would have loved to see it all, but it wasn't meant to be. The set was beautiful, and the costumes incredibly vivid, and the acting was fantastic!! I guess we'll try again next year.           Instead, Dave and I took a romantic stroll through the   Public    Gardens  . I had forgotten how much I really love   Boston  , and how rarely we get out to enjoy the city's beauty. We had a pint before heading home. Lovely evening! I love how much we can be ourselves around each other. It's a rarity, I think, at least for our anti-social, hermit-y personalities.            Saturday we met  Lisa  & Dave for dinner in the North End, and witnessed a wacky restaurant brawl before the Lord of the Rings exhibit at the   Museum   of  Science  . The exhibit was awesome, lots of costumes &amp; props. The model of Treebeard was by far the coolest, also Aragorn's shattered sword and the model of Boromir (a bit creepy, though). Great stuff. And, plenty of freaks on hand for opening night - hairy men with fake hobbit feet, and girls in tarty medieval gowns with WAY to much cleavage. Absolute nerdfest. Good fun.           Yesterday, once I finally dragged me arse out of bed, embarked on wedding dress adventures with Jen and Kiran.    It was surprisingly stress-free - Jen found her dress almost right away, I think it was the second one she tried on. It looked so great on her, definitely the right one. Gorgeous. Kiran and I found two dresses we loved as well. Some girl tried on my wedding dress at the shop - is it weird to be so excited about it? Can I still wear it, or is that a huge faux pas?    I do want to wear it one day. I hope with Dave. I would marry him tomorrow, if he asked. But, I will wait until he is ready. I would never want him to feel pressured before he's ready. He's got to come around eventually, right?!?!    No worries. Moving day is creeping closer, and that's enough to think about for now.           I'm suddenly very grouchy. Mr. Smith has blatantly insulted my intelligence. I'm hardly an IT expert, but I'm the in-house problem solver and I know the network better than anyone else here. Starting last week, we've had massive server failure, which we're still sorting out. So I'm going around to each person, explaining the situation and warning of imminent network disconnection. I get to Mr. Smith and the analysts in the Fish Tank. I give them the scoop. Mr. Smith says, right in front of me, to the OTHER  Doug  Smith , "I want you to sit down with Bill (our outsourced IT wizard) and get the story, and ask the right questions, for purposes of institutional memory." Slap in the face! Smith #2 has NEVER shown an initiative in wanting to know how the network servers work. Smith #1 doesn't deem me intelligent enough, apparently, to ask the "right questions." I am livid. I am so sick of this, and sick of keeping quiet about it. The guy is a number one inconsiderate and unfeeling bastard. Yeah, he's the same one who, when I was very depressed and not eating much, asked me if I was starving myself for my wedding. Wow. The sheer nerve of this guy....and he's practically Vice President of the company?!    He completely lacks social skills, and...what's the word...dammit. Ability to read social cues? Common courtesy? Bastard. If I go out for lunch, I may never come back.....
