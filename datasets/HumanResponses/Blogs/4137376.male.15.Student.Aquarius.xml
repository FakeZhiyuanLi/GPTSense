      Well another days of work done. Today I had to move stuff for the daycare at my old grade school to their new building. It was ok work just hauling junk from a truck then off the truck into the house. I did meet a new freshman that's going to my high school. I had met him before back in the day when I was little. Him, this other kid, and I were all on a team in a bowling league. I didn't recognize him but when he mentioned it I did. Oh well he should have fun as a freshman at my high shcool except maybe on Welcome week. LOL I wont go in on the details.  Now I get to sit around all day being bored. That's always fun. I think my purpose in life is to be bored. I can't wait for school I miss all my friends.  I'm off to be bored so stop reading because it will end soon. I'm serious! Go! Leave! Come back tomorrow when I post something else. Didn't I tell you to leave so stop reading already. This will go on forever if you don't stop reading. Wow I am bored.

      It's me again.... well who else would it be. I just woke up about 10 minutes ago and found out I had a choice whether or not I was going to go to work.  I work at my school LSH, a private catholic school, to help my mom pay off tuition. It's an ok job but I don't get any of the money. I wish I did because there are so many things I could do with it. Anyways lets continue with the story.  I had a choice and I picked I would stay home. I don't know why it pisses off my mom so much when she is the one that gave me the choice. She has been really pissed at me lately which makes my day bad and puts me in a more worse mood. All she has been doing lately is yelling at me. Like when I woke up this morning.  I've had my mom wake me up in the morning lately because I haven't been able to. I told her last night to wake me up around 7:30 so she starts waking me up around 7:00 because I'm a heavy sleeper. That's fine I don't care but then when I finally woke up at 7:34 she yelled at me because I told her to wake me up at 7:30 and I wasn't waking up, I was going to be late to work (LOL), blah blah blah. It was only 4 minutes after I had asked her to wake me up. Come on give me a break. "Throw me a frickin bone!" in the words of Dr. Evil.  Oh well I'm up for the day. Maybe I will get around to posting more about myself....Maybe not we will see. Live long and prosper....

      In the beginning there was nothing; much like here. So lets fill it up with stuff that I don't know why people would want to read. Hi my name is Michael John Breuer and guess where I live. I am 15 and going into 10 grade this year. Crap school is about to start soon and I haven't done anything this summer. Ok I've breathed but that's about it. Fine also an occasional trip to a friends house, football camp, and i met Jackie. My summer has been so boring except the Jackie part =). I guess I should tell you about myself but I'm to lazy to do that right now. See you later
