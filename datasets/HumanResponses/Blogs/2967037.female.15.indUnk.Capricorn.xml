      No one has posted in a really long time!!! I feel it is my sworn duty to do something about this, but I'm not sure what to do!! So for now I'll just make another random post!  I just found out today that I have freckles!!! That is the most terrifying thing ever!!! I've never had freckles before!!! I'm going to go screaming into the night now, so please post, so that I don't have to babble on like this again!!!!   Au Revoir

      Wow, I just remembered what my nightmare was about!! Someone let Dianna from school post on our blog!! I don't know what my sub-concious was thinking to make me have a dream like that, but it was terrifying!! And all she posted about was how cool she was and how obsessed with Nate Bjur she was!!! Wow, I'm scarying myself all over again!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh........   Au Revoir

Oh well, what is really sad is that all she talked about was Nicholas! She's more obsessed than we ever thought!!! Ooooo, and Abby's coming soooooon!!!!   Au Revoir

      I think it's broken, though. So sad.  I remember the day I got it. 5/7 of my family was on vacation and we were staying in a hotel in this little hickish town called Mariposa. My parents and sister went for a walk around town and looked at the little shops and when they came back they brought many treasures back with them - one being my preciousss and another being the location of a store that sold Drumsticks. Yum. Oh, right. Getting off topic... my parents had wanted to buy me this ring cause of the Relient K song. I had put it on one of the many tapes I had made for the trip and they loved it. So, when they saw the mood ring sitting on the shop counter, they thought of me. How grand is that? When they saw a symbol of moodiness, they thought of me =P   I forget my point for sharing this delightful tale but hey, it's summer and it's not like I've got anything better to do that share pointless stories. Thank you and good day.

      Its seems odd that the smplest thing in the world could be the most tasty. Sticky rice is like my all time favorite food. (that and lemon grass soup!)  I had it on monday night and it was reaaaallllllly good!  Yum yum! I could eat it all day!

Fruits with pits: Do not bite into. Break or cut to remove pit, cut into bite size peices. Corn-on-the-cob: Do not bite into. Cut corn off the cob. Crust: Do not bite into. Break or cut into bite size peices. Chips and tacos: Do not bite into. Subsitiute patato chips or flour tortillas Meat with bones: Do not bite off the bone. Cut meat from the bone Sticky candy: Do not chew. Soda: Rinse with water after drinking. Ice: Do not chew. Popcorn: Do not eat. Gum: Do not chew.   Wow.

      I got my braces on today. I look like a cross between a rabies infested rabiit and a dog. Its great! Haha. Good thing its summer so no one will have to see me. Except for all the church people. But they don't matter.  I decided to get the clear braces and from far away you cant even tell I have braces. But then if your, at most, 3 feet away you can totally see them. Oh well.  I can't wiat till I get them off. I h ave two years. I decided I am going to do EVERYTHING they tell me. I am sure everyone says that but then stops doing it after they have had their braces for awhile. But, I am gonna do it!  I will update you on how it goes. :)

      I wrote this poem in December when I was pretty depressed. It doens't have a name, but thats ok!  Every step I take I fall back three  I never get it right I guess it wasn’t meant to be  I wanna be like you I wanna serve you  But I feel I can’t Its just so hard.  I try I get up again  But then I fall Fall back down.   Theres nothing good in me Its all you.  This life this heart I give it up  Please, do somethign good with it   I am stuck in this whirl wind  Or should I call it  atronado.  It never stops. It just keeps swirling around  round and round   I’m ina prison without bars I can’t escape  I try but the force is to strong  I want to be loved I wanna be held

      Wow, I just had the best drive in my life. We did "accident prevention" today, it was so cool!!!! I got to floor it, and then swerve, it was a little scary but so much fun you have no idea. Then I got to legally exceed the speed limit by 15 mph, that was pretty fun too, but the best by far was the "bootleg" turn. It's the state patrol turn, you swerve to the other side of the rode, and then crank the wheel as far as you can and go forward to the other side, and then back up, and turn, we got to do it at 60 mph, that was pretty cool. I now feel that I am going to be the best driver on the road, wahoo for me!!!  Now I need to finish my English project, and then my stupid coloring for science, who would think that you would have to color still once you get to high school, it just doesn't make sense!!! Oh well it was a very entertaining day!!   Au Revoir

      Sorry I haven't posted since Wednesday, I've been incredibly busy with everything. I had my first drive on Saturday and it was super easy which was nice. I had to drive a stupid Saturn though, and all of a sudden the instructor would just put his foot on the break without telling me, and oh my gosh, it was the most annoying thing on the face of the earth!!!!  Then afterwards, we all went to see Secret Window, which was kind of predictable, but I have to admit that I didn't quite see the last twisty part coming, all in all it was pretty darn good. And Sara didn't even freak out too much which made me happy because then she didn't make my hand loose blood circulation because of how hard she was clutching it!!!!  Oooo, and an update in the driving thing, I got to drive on the freeway this morning, it was no big deal at all, I mean people usually freak out about having to drive on the freeway, but really it wasn't hard at all. I also learned that there really is a blindspot, and it's really disturbing when all of a sudden there's a car next to you that you didn't see!!!   That's really all that's happened in the past couple days I think.   Au Revoir

      Well hello everyone, I am currently at the office. I'm really really hoping to get out in time to go the the first annual CAM Movie Festival, it sounds like it will be quite interresting.   Not too darn much happened today, I had a math test, which wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, thank goodness because I didn't study very much. Although I did find out that I really need to study for my Spanish test, because I don't know how to conjugate half of the stem changing verbs!!! Oh well I've got most of tomrrow to work on it.  Oh I'm so mad, I'm going to miss the soccer game between Aaron and Sara's brother, I really wanted to go but of course I have driver's ed. I can't wait till driver's ed is over!!!!! That's all for now.   Au Revoir

      I'm sorry for not posting since Saturday, I've been a little busy lately. I have a math test tomorrow that I needed to study for..... I really dislike math, oh well, I'm sure being able to set up proportions to solve for the missing measure of the median will help me someday!!!! So not much happened today, except that Katie didn't tell Nick about our lovely plan, so he's the only one out of the loop.   We might go see Secret Window on Saturday, which will be cool, even though I've heard it's predictable, I'm sure that it will still be good. I"m not sure who's going yet but oh well, it doesn't really matter.  I have to do my first drive at driver's ed on Saturday, that will be terrifying. I think I have to do it with "Big Jon" I mean golly gee whiz, who wants to drive in a car with anyone named "Big Jon" it's a little intimidating. Especially because he says instead of getting mad at us when we mess up and drive over a cliff, he'll just laugh at us. Gee which would you prefer?!?!?!?! Oh well, at least he provides us with comic relief during our endless classes.   That's about all of the new info for today.   Au Revoir

      Wow, I have a lot to post about!!!! Last night I went to see Hidalgo with all of my wonderful friends, and it was oodles and caboodles of fun!!!! The movie itself wasn't that great, I thought it was way too unrealistic, but then again that's just me. So, halfway through the movie, Laura started choking on a mint, and she sounded like she was dying, but really it was just that she was laughing so hard, it was hysterical. Then, let's see what happened. Oh I saw a guy from driver's ed there, but I didn't say hi because I don't know his name, even though I've been going to driver's ed for 3 weeks, I guess I'm just not good with names!!!! Oh, and we started at Katie's house, and we had wonderful enchiladas courtesy of her mother, yummmmm. And let's just say that the conversations that were held a that dinner table were a far cry from what we usually talk about, but it was certanitley entertaining!!! I honestly think that someone should film us the next time we do this, because it would make a great short movie, and then we could enter it in our film festival!!!  After the movie, Johanna and I spent the night at Katie's and I seriously wanted to kill Johanna, because she kept us all up until 2 a.m. which usually wouldn't bother me, except for the fact that I was really tired to begin with, and I almost fell asleep in the movie. And she may deny it if you ask her, but it truly was all her fault!!!   Then in the morning we went to go watch Nathan and Garrett at Science Olympiad(sp?) which was fun. I'm totally serious too, I thought it was really fun, and it made me feel less like a nerd!!! But first we went to Fred Meyer to get Garrett a gift certificate for his birthday, and then to Starbucks, my haven, where I got a wonderful double tall brave late. Then off to the Science thing we went.   When we gave Garrett his present, we did it in front of his friend, and he turned the most lovely shade of tomato red that I've ever seen!!! And for once we actually didn't mean to embarrass him, and so for the rest of the day he avoided us like the plague!!! One time, we came into the building, and he was coming up the stairs and as soon as he saw us he turned around and went back down the stairs. Now we feel bad about embarrassing him, but oh well I'm sure that Fanny will be able to console him!!!  Then Katie had the greatest idea. We have a condo down in Long Beach, so this summer we decided that everyone who went to the movie last night should go down to the condo at Long Beach for 5 days. It would be so much fun, since we're right on the beach. And the town of Long Beach has the greatest acrade in the world, it has the most pinball machines that I have ever seen in my life!!!! I'm a totally pinball queen, it's my favourite arcade game!!!  I'm actually running out of things to say so I'm going to go do my English report now, and I'll probably post my review of Hidalgo later.   Au Revoir

      I'm doing some fantastic research in English class about Ernest Shackleton's expedition to the antarctic, wahoo, I feel like I'm becoming so knowlegable.   I just found out the strangest thing, my English teacher used to live near the Wincheser Mystery House! I though I was the only person in the entire world who had ever actually been there. Whenever I tell people about it they just look at me like I'm a total loon! So that made me feel better, except my lovely friend Sara just told the that "you are a total loon!" thanks a lot Sara, I can feel the love just oozing from you!!  Well I'm done for now, I'll post later, and don't forget to check the article "worthy of being featured".   Au Revoir

      I hope ya'll enjoyed my very long and entertaining post that I felt the need to treat you all with yesterday.   Well here I am in History class, listening to my friends talk to their computers, which is proving to be quite entertaining.   Well we had the greatest discussion earlier about Creaton and Evolution, which was soooo great because everyone got very mad, and the disgussion became quite heated. personally I'm neutral on the issue, so I just watched from the sidelines, and got some serious entertainment out of it.   I'll probably post some more later, if I haven't gone crazy because of my friends total lack of ability to use anything that remotely resembles technology.   Au Revoir

      After giving it some serious consideration I decided to be a sheep and follow the trend of listing what you're currently listening to, what you're reading, what you're watching etc. So here we go:   My Personal Favorites and Reviews for the month of March:    Listening to:   Queen-my own special little mix courtesy of  urlLink iTunes   urlLink Placebo -Sleeping With Ghosts, Black Market Music, and Without You I'm Nothing  urlLink Rocky Horror Punk Rock Show -a remix of all the classic songs from a classic movie  urlLink Pink Floyd -Dark Side of the Moon, courtesy of Emily   urlLink Death Cab for Cutie - even though I'm not usually into emo, i find this quite impressive   Reading:   urlLink Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  by Al Franken- a great book, that tells about things that our wonderful president has done (and yes I made the 'p' in president lower case for a reason).  urlLink The Black Jewels Trilogy  by Anne Bishop- I just started the first one which is quite impressively written, although it is slightly confusing until you get the hang of it, which really only makes sense if you've read them   Movie Reviews:    urlLink Lost in Translation - by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, Scarlett Johanssen does a great job with her role, and Bill Murray who has been a favorite of mine for years, really lets sense of humor show  urlLink Monster -absolutely amazing, Charlize Theron did an amazing job, she is one of the strongest and most versatile actresses Hollywood has seen in a long time, she completely deserved the Oscar, and I hope that it has a good home on her shelf  urlLink The Triplets of Belleville -the only words spoken in this movie are a a sentence at the beginning and a sentence at the end, but it is far from silent. The whole movie consists of sounds and music, there are references to american obesity and arrogance, which absolutely made my day, it is a must see for any movie connoisseur  urlLink Thirteen - I wasn't sure if I would like this as I find "coming of age" films to be quite irritating, but this was extremely good, and very thought provoking. I was pleasantly surprised by the performances by both Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood.   Movies I absolutely Cannot Wait to See:    urlLink Scooby Doo 2 - I want to see it purely for it's entertainment value, I have a great love of the intelligent great dane (oxymoron in my book) and would see anymovie, with even the slightest reference to Scooby  urlLink House of Sand and Fog - I don't know why I didn't see it while it was in theaters, but now I'm kicking myself because it won't be on DVD until 30 of this month which is much too long for me to wait  There are many others but for the time being that is all that I have time to do. I cannot believe I just jumped on a bandwagon, but I guess I'd have to join it sooner or later, and it ended up being sooner.  Au Revoir

      I just read the greatest thing on the face of the earth, it's this year's Darwin Awards, now I tend to get a kick out of those anyways because the stupidity of others never ceases to amaze me (I don't mean that in a horrible, mean person way). I have decided to post a must read article or some such thing everyday I post, so here is the first instalment of                                                                               Must Read Wednesday   The top 2 go to Oregon and Washington. What does that say about the Northwest.    THE DARWIN AWARDS  : : It's that time again!  The Darwin awards are given each year to recognize (the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. : : This year's awards are classic. : : 5th RUNNER-UP : Goes to a San Angelo, Californian man who died when he hit a lift tower at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. The 22-year old, David Hubbell, was pronounced dead at the Central Mammoth Hospital.  The accident occurred about 3 a.m. according to the Mono County Sheriff's Department. Hubbell and his friends had apparently hiked up a ski run called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope. : : The investigation determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed.   4th  RUNNER-UP : Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, who was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found him unconscious in front of the store.  Paramedics removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death. : : 3rd RUNNER-UP : Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag that was standing above him on an overhanging rock. He was killed instantly when it fell on him. : : 2nd RUNNER-UP : "Man loses face at party" is how the headline read. A man at a West Virginian party (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used a .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl.M.D. Payne.  "Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it. It wouldn't go off and Stromyer said: 'I'll show you how to set it off.' He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and tongue off", Payne added. : : Stromyer was listed in guarded condition on Wednesday, with extensive facial injuries according to a spokesperson at  Charleston Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that," Payne said. : : 1st RUNNER-UP : Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grant's Pass, Oregon.  A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that if the arrow had gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Dr. Delashaw said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Dr. Delashaw also said that had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon.  Said Roberts, "I feel so dumb about this." : : No charges have been filed, but the Josephine County District Attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under  investigation. : : THIS YEAR'S WINNER : The late John Pernicky and his friend, the late Sal Hawkins, of the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the George Washington Amphitheater. Having no tickets (but also having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy to "hop" over the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. The pair pulled their pickup truck over to the fence.  The plan was for Mr.Pernicky, who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins, to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. : : Unfortunately for Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his body and without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make matters worse still, his pocket knife penetrated his thigh on landing. : : Mr. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away.  However, in his drunken haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence, landing 30' below atop his friend. : : Police arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100' from the truck and dead from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25 feet in the air.

      hey i just got back from driver's ed, wahoo, that was some fun times. we got to hear horror stories about what happens when you fall asleep at the wheel or don't put your seat belt on, i mean i guess we don't have brains so we couldn't figure it out for ourselves, oh well i guess if it keeps people from crashing the whatever. sorry that was my little rant, it was just extemely boring, and my lovely coffee didn't even perk me up a bit, that really shows you how borin git was.   my philisophical thought for the day is that when i'm a little old lady and have thinning hair, i'm gonna cut it short just so that i can have a comb over like mr. albers, i mean we should support the old people in their persuit to hide their thinning hair. isn't it important to respect your elders. so that's why when i'm a little old lady with a cane, i'm gonna have a comb over, even though it's usually only guys who have them!!!

      this is my first post on my beautiful blogger, and i feel like i should say something profound, but for some reason all i can think of is the words to  Queen song, that happened when i took my math quiz today, it was very odd! okey dokey i'm trying to be profound so how about i give you the definition of profound so that you have something to think on until my next post. alrighty here it goes: pro·found adj.-1. Situated at, extending to, or coming from a great depth; deep. 2. Penetrating beyond what is superficial or obvious: a profound insight.   I like the second one the best, but that's just my opinion.

      Okey dokey then everyone, I'm so so sorry about not posting in ages. I really haven't been busy at all, I just haven't really felt like posting, so through some coaxing from my fans, here I am posting. Not too darn much has happened lately, although I think I"m going to lazer tag with Katie on Sunday, and for the record, I have never played lazer tag before. What kind of craziness is that?, you say. Well let me tell you I grew up like a little hippie child, where I wasn't allowed to do anything that involved shooting people. So to this day I haven't even played with squirt guns. So yes, I say, yes I will go do lazer tag!!! I feel so liberated after saying that, a huge weight has lifted from my shoulders, and I fell free, free to fly like the birds that I have never shot!!!   Wow, that was a little, how do you say, special? Yes well that's how I feel today special.  Oh well I guess something great did happen today. We were on assembly schedule, so we got to eat lunch a whole hour earlier, which may not seem like much to you, fellow reader, but it is a great difference in the mind of someone who doesn't get to eat lunch until 12:30!!! Anyways, the assembly was great since it wasn't actually an assembly at all. It was an auction. Yes, my friend, we were auctioning people off in my school. It was called a "gopher auction". Whoever bid the highest got a senior for the day, and this lucky senior has to do whatever their "owner" wants them to. Impressively enough, one of the lovely, and talented seniors went for $65!!! Unfortunately none of this money goes to the seniors themselves, it goes to NHS, which is a little twisted if you ask me!!  So I think that is all for the day, and tomorrow I will post to tell you how my beautiful Spanish presentation goes. We're doing a skit, about the sun and the moon, and it should be interesting!!! So wish me luck.   Au Revoir   P.S. The website that hosts my shoutbox, is having "technical difficulties" so don't email me and tell me it's not there, because I  know  it's not there. Thanx.

      Oh my gosh I feel really bad about having not blogged in ages!!! I've been incredibly busy, and then we went on vacation for spring break, so this is going to be a very long blog, so I'd recommending getting nice and cumfy and popping yourself some popcorn, cuz you're gonna be here a while.  Lets start at the beginning of Spring Break. We left on Saturday morning for Mt. Shasta in California where we have a condo, my friend and I were going to learn snowboarding. So the first day we drove forever. Then late in the afternoon we ended up in a really obscure part of the Redwood forest, which was amazing, the trees were incredibly tall, I couldn't believe it, and we took tons of pictures. The road through the forest was a little bumpy, and there was a really long drop down the side, so it was a little frightening, but still fun. We went on a little hike, and found some trees that were wider than I am tall, and some that grew together and then apart again. Then we got back in the car and continued on our trip. We ended up in a small town near the coast named Crescent City. We took several stops at the ocean, which I didn't understand since it looks exactly like our ocean in Washington, but alas, it made everyone else happy. Then we tried to find a place to eat dinner, and we ended up at some weird pizza place. The guy who took our order, was actually quite attractive for a small town boy, but everyone there smelled really funny, and it wasn't just me, Annie noticed it too. Anyways, after I got my yummy veggie pizza we went back to the hotel, and watched the end of Saturday Night Live, which was great, as usual.  The next day, we headed straight for Mt. Shasta, and not too much happened on the way there except another stop at the beach. When we got there we all just laid around because we were exhausted form the driving, and by that time I was already on the second book that I brought with me. We walked around, and determined that Annie and I could go golfing if we wanted to, they just wouldn't let us drive the golf carts, which made us really really mad!!!!!  On Monday we didn't really do anything, we kind of hung out, and went into town and bought my mom some hiking boots, then I found the cutest swimsuit, but I'm cheap and didn't want to pay $68 for a swimsuit, I thought that was ridiculous!!!! Then we came home and had smores over our lovely beautiful portable grill!!! They were soooo good and gooey, and just plain yummalicious!!!!!  Then the day we had been waiting for finally arrived: Tuesday, the day of reckoning. We were going to learn to snowboard. Of course we had brought clothes that were way too heavy, so were were really hot, which later turned into a really bad thing. So we got all of our gear and stuff, and halfway through our lesson we got really hot, so we took off our coats, and of course I being the person I am, forgot to put sunscreen on my arms, you can already tell this isn't gonna be pretty. So we had a great lesson and actually got pretty decent. Then we had our second lesson where we go up the lift, oh yes, up the lift!!!!!! We fell of the lift, at the end, cuz we kinda fell into each other, but alas, it was very funny to watch. We bit the dust so many time going down that mountain, I swear it was just great, but we made it down and at the end of the day Annie and I could proudly say , we made it down the mountain!!!!!!!! Then we got home and assessed the damage that our poor bodies had acquired. My arms were the brightest shade of red I have ever seen, you couldn't even begin to believe how burnt they were!!!!! And it hurt so bad that when I tried to roll over in bed that night I couldn't.  The day after, the day of reckoning. Annie and I were so sore that we couldn't lift anything above or head, and I'm not joking, toweling my hair dry was the most challenging thing. And of course that was the day that we had planned to go to the caves, which we did. And these caves involved hiking up almost 200 steep stairs!!!!!!!! I'm not even going to tell you how much pain we were in.  I don't' even remember what we did the next day, I think we went to the wild life refuge and spent 3 hours looking at ducks, but I tried to block that out of my memory!!!!!! Although somewhere along this trip we made it to and In n' Out Burger, which if you've never been, is the greatest food on the place of the earth, I got my customary burger, fries, and a strawberry milk shake!!!!  The last day we found out that my father had lost my digital camera, yes that's right it was my camera that I had been given for Christmas, and it wasn't a cheesy camera, it was a very very nice Sony camera, and it had all of our trip pictures on it. So now I have no proof that I actually went snowboarding, which is probably the worst part!!!!!!  That is all I can possibly type, so I'm going to say good bye and a'du for now, and tomorrow. I'll try to catch everyone up on the first part of this week, and then maybe I'll learn my lesson about getting behind on blogging.   Au Revoir

      Wahoooo, we had sooooo much fun today.   Okey so everyone went to Enchanted Forest today, by everyone I mean, Katie, Nick, Garrett, Johanna, and me. So yeah I was totally freaked out because, originally Nick wasn't going to be able to come, and Sara was coming instead. So I was cool with that and then I like drove up, and Garrett jumps out of the car and I'm like whoa, what's going on here. So Katie told me that Sara never got back to her so she invited Garrett, and then Nick came back from his thing. Now that in itself isn't creepy at all, I mean it made it more fun. The scary part is, I had a dream last night where, who was there, oh I'd say, Nick and Garrett. It's a little creepy!!!!  So the entire day was el momento de Kodak, Kodak moment, between Katie and Nick. Garrett totally came up with it, and I agreed completely, it was sooooo true. I mean they were just so cute together!!! I mean I knew that they were kind of a "thing" (and I use "thing" in the loosest of terms) but still, it was just funny. I got such pure enjoyment out of it!!!  But the most disturbing part of the entire day, was when I was informed that Katie and Nick had decided that they should get Garrett and I together. So anytime I'd even talk to him she'd do the "Katie eyes", so the entire day I'd look at her and there she'd be, giving me that look. I swear, it's not my fault. No one else would go on "Ring of Fire", so hey why not go with Garrett, I mean seriously!!!! I just don't get her thinking sometimes!!! I mean I'm not the one who's totally smitten with a guy!!!  So right after lunch we took the most obvious coarse of action, we rode the "Scrambler", twice in a row. The first time, Jo, Garrett, and I all squished into one thing, while Nick and Katie (go figure) were all nice and comfortable!!! So then the next time, Katie, Jo, and I went together, and talked the entire time. Then we decided to go on the wooden roller coaster for the 5th time, and I was going to go with Jo, but then Garrett was going to go in the front, so I ended up going with him, which was sooo much fun, I love the front!!!!!  We also did bumper cars twice, very fun!! We were the only people there that actually understood that the purpose of bumper cars is to, gee I don't know, bump the cars!!!! So we were totally trying to kill each other, even though Katie didn't really want to run into Nick, again gee I wonder why!!! And despite what anyone tells you, we tied, the guys did not beat us!!!! That was the fist time, the second time, Jo and Katie didn't go, so I went with the guys, and Garrett got me a few times, and I got him back, so I think in the end, it was another tie!!!  Then we went and had dinner, yummy Chinese food, which was good. Katie got all excited about the shrimp, but hey shrimp's exciting stuff!!  Then Jo, Nick, and I squished in the back, and Katie sat up front, with me in the middle. Seriously the entire trip Katie and Nick passed notes, it was sooooo funny. The best funniest part is that Garrett had to play the middle man, and found it irritating, so they decided consolidation and outsourcing would the the best way to cut down on excess costs. In the end Garrett and I were making fun of them though, so it was all good!!!!   So the only other thing I can think to post is that Garrett now knows where I live, so that's a little disturbing!! Oh, but I was  extremely  graceful!!! I swear I couldn't get out of the wooden roller coaster, but then later Nick did the same thing so I didn't feel so bad. But when I was getting out of the car I totally tried to kill my self, I almost face planted right into my yard. I mean I love my grass but not that much!!! But I had a good recovery, and made a lovely bow, worthy of a court!!   So that tis all, and I'm sorry for this being so darn long, but hey it was a long day!!!   Au Revoir   P.S. I decided to add the meaning of "smitten" on here for Nick's sake, since he seemed a little confused when Katie and I were talking about it earlier:  smitten adj. - To strike or affect with passion, as love.

      I think I need a faux fur coat. They're sooo cool and fuzzy, and you could pet it all the time, it would be like having and animal following you around!!  So I'm at my grandpa's house doing absolutely  nothing !!! But hey it's fun to come here so it doesn't matter. We're going to deep fry a turkey today. That will be simply brilliant. The last time we tried to do this, the oil spilled over and it was like "flame on". My mother freaked out, and wow I don't think I'd laughed that hard in a long time!!! Of course no one was hurt, and nothing burned, otherwise I wouldn't have laughed but still, it was great. The turkey tasted good too. We're going to make yummy french fries today too!!! That makes me happy because I'd try to live off jello and fries if I could. But then that'd make me the size of a house with a two car garage, so scratch that plan.   So on Monday I'm going to Wild Waves with Katie, Sara, and Jo. It's going to be ever so fun! But we're not going to swim which is a little weird, but supposedly they just put in a new roller coaster, which is supposed to be pretty fast!! As long as it's better than the stupid California Screamin' roller coaster at Disneyland. That one was not scary at all, it was good, but nothing to write home about!! Oh and by the way Laura, we were going to invite you but then Katie heard that you would be busy, so we didn't, sorry about any lack of communication!!!!   Au Revoir

      Yes it truly is, I think I have a jello fetish. I always wanted to just live off of jello, but sadly that just wouldn't work, due to the lack of, gee I don't know, substance!!!  So today was pretty entertaining. In English we continued to work on our island project, very cool since Ben decided that maijuana would be our main export. He then proceeded to inform us that the price of marijuana is high now and that he knows this through personal experience. I always knew he was an interesting person, I guess this just proves me correct. Although why that makes him interesting is still a little cloudy in my mind, no pun intended. I'm not sure how many people will actually get that pun. Alas, the poor pitiful, innocents of my school. Anyways, then ummmm not much happened except at lunch. Lunch seems to be the most interesting part of the day. So my friend got some good news, which I knew she'd be getting all along. So we were like giggly high school girls all day, it was really funny, and quite entertaining!  So ummm I think that's pretty much all that happened. Looking back it doesn't seem that interesting, but at the time it was. Oh it was very interesting let me tell you.   As soon as the dust settles around a very strange thing that happened today, I will inform all of my many (2) fans about it!!!! So please wait with bated breath, and in a couple weeks I shall explain everything.   I think this is the most normal post that I have ever written, and it feels strange. Sadly I can't think of anything to make it even remotely strange!!!  OOOOO I know, I had this total epiphany yesterday. I realized that Praga Khan, my absolute favorite band of all time, is part of Lords of Acid!!! How dumb was I for not figuring that out, I mean I swear, I've like both bands for a long time and never made the connection. I just can't believe that, and any fellow fans of PK or LOA, I know it's pathetic, seriously I do. I mean musically they're a little different, but when you listen to them back to back, they sound a lot alike!!! So that was my great epiphany, and I hope I have saved some troubled soul the difficulty of figuring this out for themselves.   Au Revoir

      Yes yes, today was quite interesting. We started out in science making these crazy "hummer" things. They're supposed to make a noise like a bee or something when you swing them around really fast. So yeah mine was great, if you stand really far back and squint. Yeah it was ugly beyond belief but hey it worked so who cares?!?! Anyways, I was trying to make mine work and I hit Sara in the head, yeah oops, I seriously didn't mean to, I swear!!!  Then to continue on a good day English was awesome!!!! We get to pick a partner, and then we get stuck with to other people, and we get to create an island. Oh yes ours is brilliant! Sara and I decided to call it "Decades Island". It's shaped like a record, my idea thank you, and all the towns are named after good bands from different decades. We have Queentown or something like that for the 80s. And we have Beach Boys Beach, yeah it's ab fab!!! It was sooo funny though because Ben was going along with us and thought it was a cool idea, but then Hope totally freaked out because we wouldn't let her name one of the towns after a stupid Rap band. I swear it was soooo funny, Sara and I honestly thought she was going to go "tell the teacher" on us. Seriously, could she be lacking anymore in maturity????  So the only other interesting thing happened at lunch. First, Jo was like trying to keep a secret from us, but I figured it out with a little help from Katie!!!! It didn't really make sense, but maybe that's just me. So then Laura, Sara, and I tried to come up with our own secret to keep from them but it didn't work. Can  you tell that we were all feeling a little juvenile today???? I guess that's what happens when the end of school is soooooo close!!!!!! So anyways, back to the totally entertaining lunch period. We looked over and Zane was trying to get in a fight with Ben again!!!!! I mean seriously, last time we ended up with a hole in our lunch room wall. Yeah, so then Zane tried to throw a punch but Ben just ducked and it was sooooo funny, because Matt had to stop Zane from total trying to kill Ben. The funniest thing was that Ben could have total taken Zane down, but he chose the smart way, and just tried to ignore him. I thought that was pretty cool!!!   I think that's all for now!! Ya never know with me thought I'm sure I'll remember something, and post at like 3 in the morning, oh well!!   Au Revoir   This is hysterical, I just ran a spell check, and it said the proper spelling for "Zane" was "zany" hahahah I thought that was great, since anyone who knows him would totally agree that he should be renamed that!!!!

      Yes it is true we are going to paint the bathroom PINK!!! You have no idea how excited I am!! Well all the exclamation points might give you a clue, but you just couldn't possibly grasp the depth of my excitment and glee!  I have been trying to paint my house forever, and for some reason everyone thinks that "we don't need paint, why would we need paint?" Seriously, our walls are plain, boring, WHITE! Where's the fun in that, there   is   no fun, it's boring, stupid, and above all else, UGLY!!  So yesterday, we came to the decision that, wow paint would be a good thing!!! So we are officially painting one of the upstairs bathrooms PINK!!!   Now you may be wondering, why pink? Well let me tell you, it will compliment the light pinkish counter perfectly! And the walls won't be just any pink, you see, but a  rosey  pink. It's going to look absolutely and totally swank!!!  Well I must go now, for we are off to purchase the lovely rosey pink paint!!!

      I finally decided to become an official member of the Environmental Victory Project. Their mission is to help avoid another 4 long, torturous years of Shrub (aka. Bush). So if any of you got an email from me asking you to join, I hope you do because this is really important. Bush is honestly ruining our environment and it's terrifying when you read the facts. This is my favorite quote from the Environmental Victory website:    Earth to Bush!   President Bush says we should send a man to Mars. Next he proposes a budget for next year cutting $1.9 billion from environmental programs. Save the Earth send Bush to Mars!   I think that is absolutely brilliant!!!   So on to something less controversial. Today was interesting, I came to the realization that my life, and that of my friends, could actually be a TV show. Granted it would be like all the other "teen dramas" on television today, but it would still be entertaining. Very few people reading this know why it could be a TV show, but hopefully I will be able to explain why in a couple weeks. I'll be able to explain as soon as one of my friends tells another of my friends something. Gee I hope that made sense, currently I'm having difficulty forming coherent sentences.  I think that's sadly all that I can come up with, but soon, very soon, I will be able to share with the entire internet world why my live should be a television show!!!

I do feel quite rebelious changing my blog in the middle of class though. It makes me feel so omnipitent!!!! Yeah, my poor friend Laura is being stalked buy this very disturbing person who happens to be sitting in my general vacinity, gee I hope he takes a hint, for Lara's sake!!!  OOOOO I got the greatest CD from Sara yesterday. Her brother gave it to her as stocking stuffer, it's the greatest CD. It's got Walk like an Egyptian, 99 Luftbaloons, Puttin' on the Ritz, and oh my gosh it's the the Realx song that's in Zoolander, which is sooooo great!!! Anyways, I took he amazing CD running with me this morning, and I swear I ran faster and longer than usual, 80s music is great. They should soooooo use it in the Olymics this year. Wahooooo!!!  So now I've gotta pay attention, since he's starting to look at me funny!!!!   Au Revoir

The only thing that's making me mad is that my new shout box won't work for me!!!!   So life's been treating me pretty darn well I think, school has been pretty darn easy lately which is incredibly nice, since there's only  a month left of school. OOOO good new, Annie and I got  great  seats to the Phantom Planet concert!!! I am so very excited to see them, it's jus crazy.  Oh even more good news, the principal from Hockinson said that since I'm number one on the boundary exception list, that I'm as good as in for next year. I am so excited about it, I mean I'll get to actually take real classes, instead of these dumb classes I have to take now!

I am quite tempted to stand on my roof and yell it to the world. But I have very mean neighbors, and they would quite mad at me.   Oh I also forgot to say that we got an A on our spanish presentation. Yes we did a super good job.   Everytime I say "super" I feel like I'm a very bubbly person, where in reality, I'm not. People tell me I'm intimidating, which I really don't understand. I'm like this little blonde girl, how can that be intimidating. Alas, I guess in the working place that is a good thing.   So much for a grand enterance, but I guess I promised that to you tomorrow, so never mind.   Au Revoir

      Well hello everyone. I feel the need to let you know that I have a new hero, besides Jaime Oliver that is. His or her (I'm no quite sure which yet) name is dj-twilight, I just read his/her blog and it was the greatest thing ever, I found myself thoroughly entertained.   Today I broke my self imposed rule of never going to see stupid-high school-teenage-girl-flicks, and saw Mean Girls but alas, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I only went to see it because Tina Fey wrote it and is in it, and I love her, she is my absolute favorite SNL person, besides Mango of course!!! Anyways, the movie was pretty darn good, even though we thought it was at 1:20, but it wasn't until 1:50, so we had to wait forever. Then when we first got there, there were these two (I hate to use this phrase because I find it degrading and irritating)  pre-teen  boys there. They were acting really dumb, and then they tried to convince me that they really didn't know each other, I'm not quite sure why they wanted to do that but oh well. So I guess all in all it was a pretty decent movie, and I had fun.  Before I went to the movie, I went to the Farmer's Market, which was oodles of fun. I got a  ton  of flowers, and they're super wicked. And I got tonnnnns  of tomatoes, which totally made my day, since I kind of have a tomato fetish. A little strange, but what can you expect.   Ugh, it was super hot today!!!! I swear it was absolutely dreadful, I thought I was going to pull a Wicked Witch of the West and melt!   Oooo, I found a whole bag of my old scarves, and I found out that a lot of them are vintage, and by cool designers. So I've decided to wear them as belts. I've also come to the decision that instead of using pony tail holders, I'm going to use ribbons to tie my hair back.   Well I must take my leave now, but I promise that I will try to make a grand entrance tomorrow.   Au Revoir

      Well I had a grand time today!! Wow, it really did start of a little strange. My family is a total magnet for weirdness!!!  So I was hanging out at the barn with my lovely horse, and the dogs all started barking. Now this is a normal occurrence, because of course they must protect us from the squirrels!! So my mum put the dogs away and we thought that was the end of it. Then later we hear someone yelling, "help" so we got out, and the guy who lives on the other side of the woods was by the fence and he'd lost his cow!! So my mum made me run out there with a lead rope and help him. Well when I got there, he'd sort of gotten a hold of the cow, but he couldn't grab the rope, so I had to climb over the fence. Now this isn't a very stable fence, so this was a tad precarious!!! Well I totally freaked out the cow, and it ran off into the woods. Then the guy came back, and he had to look for his shoe because he'd lost it somewhere. And I must tell you that this guy was Russian, so he had a heavy accent, I hardly had any idea what he was saying, so that made the whole thing even more comical!! Well I don't know if he ever did find the cow, but I certainly found it entertaining. So I spent my morning chasing a cow around the forest with a Russian guy!!!  Then I got to go to the movies!!! Wahooo, it was sooo great to see Garrett, Katie, and Nick!!!! We went to see Spiderman-2 and it was very fun!!! The movie was actually really good!! It was much better than the first one, probably because it didn't have to follow the comics!! Although, I could have seen any movie and it would have been good considering the fact that the company was quite good!!!!  Later we went to Garrett's Youth Group. Well Garrett, Nick and I went, Katie bailed and had to go to dance class!!! Well it was really fun, except Nick kept bugging me, but oh well!! We got to play a brilliant game involving throwing balls at other people. Now I've never been much for those types of games, but it was still quite entertaining!!!! And I understand that you had to do tech stuff Garrett, so don't worry about it!! It's fine!!  Ooooh, and even more good news to add to this entire thing!!!! Katie, Abby, and I are hanging out tomorrow!!!! I'm sooo excited, we have an incredible amount to catch up on!!! I can't wait!!! It shall be great fun!!!

That is the most convoluted sentence I have ever written!! I'm thinking that because I laugh at my own jokes, I might be a tad bit conceited, although, hey, maybe it's just that I laugh at anything even remotely funny, so, subconsciously I'm thinking,  That was funny, why not laugh?    Right then, so I'm actually out of things to say!! Which is quite a rarity!!  Oooo, no wait, scratch that, I do have news!! I got my report card today!!! And all along I knew I got the big 4.0, but it's simply brilliant to see it on a piece of official looking paper!! Note that I say official  looking . Coming from my school, you never know how official it really is!!  Katie got back today!!! I think Nicholas is probably more excited that me though, haha, oh well!!! I guess he's got a right to be excited about it!!!  So, that tis all for now I will take my leave now.   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  New Design, Thousand Foot Krutch

      Well I've spent the entire day at the office. Wahoo, isn't that just my favorite place to be. The best part is that I even got to work!!! I spent 2.5 hours doing invoices and account info!! That's a long time to be doing something that is so utterly mindless!!  I did get to work on my farmer's tan this morning though!! That's always a fun thing to do!!  I just read the greatest thing on BBC!! It's about how people in England are counterfiting tea bags!! Isn't that just the funniest thing?!?! Well I got a kick out of it, so here's the article:    Why imitation is not always flattering  By Jennifer Quinn  BBC News Online Magazine    Luxury handbags, DVDs, computer software - all well-known targets of counterfeiters. But the UK is being flooded with other fake goods, including teabags. It's a crime that stabs at the heart of British society and costs billions.  It might look like a real teabag. It will probably cost as much as a real teabag. But who knows what lurks within that flimsy fabric, waiting to unleash its witch's brew on an unsuspecting drinker whose only mistake is wanting a cuppa?   Everyday goods that consumers assume would be genuine - after all, what self-respecting bad guy would go to the trouble of counterfeiting a box of washing powder? - are increasingly the target of crooks looking to make a quick profit.   "That's one of the trends. It used to be that luxury goods were primarily the ones being attacked," says Ruth Orchard, the director-general of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, a UK-based group that represents more than 200 manufacturers in 30 different countries.   "It's now every consumer product you can think of: washing powder. Condoms. It's just unbelievable. And instead of undercutting on price, and being almost able to justify it - you know, 'We're doing a service to the consumer because we're offering them a cheap alternative' - they're charging about the same."   Brew-haha   High-price goods - think dodgy Louis Vuitton handbags or fake Burberry caps - have long been duplicated by those who want to make a quick buck by cashing in on the work that others have done.     Certain streets in New York and Washington DC, for example, are well-known as places a wannabe fashionista can go for a Kate Spade purse that might only cost $20 instead of the hundreds of dollars the genuine article would fetch.   But now, says Ms Orchard, counterfeiters are manufacturing everything from tea to vodka to children's sun cream - which while it may seem amusing, is a serious concern for businesses large and small.   "We find it fascinating that there's actually a huge problem with fake teabags. Would you believe it?" she says. "It's an enormous problem, and I think it's pretty much a worldwide problem.   "There are particular brands that are attacked in this way. They tend to be well-known teabag brands. And they're quite sophisticated, but they're fake. And they're sold at approximately the same price."    I hope you read that article. I love the brits!! They're sooo darn funny!! And exceedingly brilliant!!  Well that's all for now!

      Well yes, let me tell you today was yet another early morning!! We went to the Farmer's Market this morning and my mum decided to wake me up before 8 because she had it in her head that we had to leave at 8:30. Now last night we went over several times the fact that we would not have to leave until 9:30!! I'm and not looking forward to becoming senile, let me tell you!!  We did get a ton of veggies and flowers though, so I'm quite happy!! And guess what!!! We got cherries!! Now I know the joke is cherry tomatoes, but cherries are close enough!! They're actually really good too!!  I really dislike it when we have company over though! It means that I have to be sociable and be a "delightful child"!! Alas. At least my mum is nice and is letting me hide out in the office!!   Abby gets here tomorrow!! I'm sooo excited, we haven't seen her since before winter formal!!! And then Katie's coming home on Tusday!! Finally!!! I imagine Nicholas misses her even more than I do though!!  So I think I need to go out and be sociable, but I shall return!!!

It's Hot Fuss by The Killers. It's sooo darn good!!! I was quite impressed by it!! Then I downloaded one of the greatest songs ever!! It's from an HBO show, it's soooo cool!! I found it quite entertaining!!  Oh and I'm quite looking forward to Wednesday. We're going to see Spiderman 2!! I'm really hoping that it's better than the first one. I mean it followed the comics perfectly (don't ask how I know that!) but cinematicaly it wasn't that great!! I also dislike Toby McGuire so considering that he plays Spiderman, that might make me a tad biased!   More good new, I think I've finally determined what shade of purple to paint my room. Now I understand that picking a  shade  of purple seems a minute detail, but let me tell you, it is really quite important! I pick the wrong shade of purple, and bam! it clashes with my entire bedroom, and I have to paint all over again. We certainly wouldn't want that to happen!!  Well I'm off to go do something productive with what little time is left in the day!   Au Revoir

      I finally got to talk to Katie!!! She has called me 4 times and each time I haven't been home, so she's left me very strange messages! Wow, I hadn't quite realized how much I missed my twin, it's a tad strange her not being here. Alas, I have everyone else, so I can make it until Tuesday! It was really funny though because we were talking online and we haven't seen each other in a week, and all we ended up talking about was her and Nicholas!! Then she made me call him because she wanted him to get online! Of course he wasn't home, but then 5 minutes later he calls me and so I talked to him for a while!  Oh, I had the most entertaining evening though, I talked to Laura, Mandy, David, and Jo. That was very entertaining! They're crazy!! Then Laura and I decided that we're going to join the golf team and the debate team next year! Garrett said he'd teach me to golf, so hey ya never know, maybe we will actually join the golf team!! That would be hysterical though, because we'd golf against Melissa, and Laura and I would revel in the opportunity to do that!!!  That's all I can think about to say aside from the fact that Katie's mum told her relatives about me. So now people thousands of miles away know about my personal life!!! That's a tad crazy if you ask me!!   Au Revoir

      I just got back from the planning thing at Hockinson. Everytime I got to that school I just can't believe that I actually got out of CAM and am going to such an awesome new school! It's going to be soooooo much fun next year, I can't wait!! I have to take all the boring classes this year so that I can get them out of the way. Although I am going to take journalism, so that's going to be very cool!! I wonder if they have a chess club????   Oh I'm going to go get my books for school today. I have to read a book by a lovely foreign author and then when we start school, I have to write an essay "defining the cultural context through the eyes of a character in the novel and the life of the author." Wow, that sounds like it's actually going to be challenging! I can't remember the last time that I actually had to  try  at something in school!!   Well I'm off to Barns and Noble to purchase some wonderful french books!   Au Revoir

      Wow, this is going to be the most far-ranging post ever!!  We start our story on Sunday. I got to vacuum my grandpa's screened porch!! That was seriously lacking in entertainment, although there is nothing as heartening as vacuuming up cobwebs and spiders! It did make me feel like a cold blooded killer though because I vacuumed up a living spider. Oh well, I look at is as payback! So then my mom decided that we should go buy plants to put in the planters. Now this was a brilliant thing because we got to take my grandpa's convertible!! I love that car, when I get my license, I am determined to get that car!! Anyways, so I had just taken a shower and I'd forgotten my blow dryer, so I just stuck it in a ponytail and got in the car, and away we went. By the time we got to the flower place my hair was completely dry, and this was only a 20 minute drive!! I've decided that I don't need a blow dryer anymore, I just need a convertible!! Then later I went to see Chronicles of Riddick with my dad and uncle. It was a pretty good movie. The plot was lacking a little, but the special effects were awesome!!  Then Monday rolled around. We had left my Hockinson registration forms at my grandpa's house, and my mom wouldn't go and ask for more papers because she didn't' want to look disorganized. So I got to drive almost 3 hours on the freeway!!! That was brilliant, although I don't really get why people freak out about driving on the freeway, it's nothing too special, although it is better than city driving! Then we went to the mall because I needed shoes for fencing. I got the greatest pair of tennis shoes, they're every so comfey!! Then the greatest part of the entire day finally came, I got to go to Laura's house for a party, shin-dig thing!  So we got there at 5 and hung around, and walked down to the creek and Emily talked about fishing with cheese, it was a very odd conversation but that is only the beginning!! Then we ate a great picnic dinner of teryaki chicken, rice, potstickers, and watermelon. It was quite tasty!! Then we watched "Roman Holiday" with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. It was a very odd movie, I guess the fact that nobody was really paying attention didn't help too much. During the movie, Emily was doing something that required some serious talent, and then Sara says out of the blue, "Does anyone want a Creamsicle?" Emily and I burst out laughing, and we couldn't stop!! It was the funniest thing, because what we were laughing at wasn't that funny in itself, but the fact that Sara so desperately wanted to know what we were laughing about, made it all the funnier!!  Then we watched the greatest movie known to mankind!! "The Attack of the Killer tomatoes". Wow that is the best movie. And they're not only tomatoes, they're cherry tomatoes!!! Now I think only Katie and Jo will get the humour there, but let me tell you, when the tomatoes started attacking, I could not help but laugh, it was just the greatest thing!!!   We ate so many cream puffs, jelly-beans, and fat-boys!! Wow, everyone was sooo sick, it wasn't even funny!!!  Finally it was sort of dark out so we went star-watching, and saw several bats, which was pretty cool. Then randomly I said "Let's go roll down hills." So everyone got up and waddled inside their sleeping-bags, to the hill, and we just rolled down. We did it so many times that everyone was dizzy and we were staggering around like a bunch of drunks!! We kept rolling into each other, wow it was sooo darn creative!!  I'm not too sure what happened after that, it's all sort of a blurr, although I do remember waking up many a time with bugs all over!!!  In the morning we we ate breakfast and Jo had to leave early which was very sad!! We went to Laura's grandparents condo/apartment thingy and played tennis!! It was quite entertaining, Laura and I beat Emily and Sara twice!! Hahaha, it was soo darn entertaining. Once Laura hit it so high that it went out of the court and landed in the pool!!! Speaking of pools......We decided to go swimming. It was only Sara, Laura, and I though because Emily couldn't find her swim suit. We played marco-polo, which was very entertaining. Then we all went and hung out in the hot tub for a while. We all got a tad hungry, so we ate lunch, which was very very good!!!  When we got back to Laura's house, Emily made us all eat the rest of the cream puffs so that she could have the box. Wow, we all felt soo incredibly sick!! It was the greatest thing every!!!   There are many a wonderful phrase, and joke that came out of that shin-dig. We will be remembering that evening for an incredibly long time!!   Au Revoir   Oh, and I forgot to explain my title. I got the greatest pair of shorts today!! They're like bermuda shorts only actually cool!! They come down to just above my knees, they're the greatest things ever!! I was quite thrilled when I found them!

      Isn't that the greatest thing you've ever heard!! It was on a church sign, I just thought it was brilliant!!  So we went to see Cavalia today in Seattle. It was sooo very cool!!  I found it ever so entertaining though because everyone was clapping at the things that are really easy to do. I guess it's because I can do a lot of what they did, but still, I just got a kick out of it! I was very impressed though, some of the stuff they did was amazing!!   That's about all I can think to say right now, I guess I'm not being too darn creative today. Alas.   Au Revoir

      Well we're having some beeeautiful weather here today in sunny middle of nowhere!!  I'm here at my grandpa's house just chillin' out, waiting for my dad to get out of the shower so we can leave. We're going to see Cavalia in Seattle today. It's supposed to be like Cirque du Soleil on horses, which will be awesome!! I love Cirque du Soleil and horses, so hey it's like two of my favorite things mixed into one!!  Well I'm being teased a little because I decided to wear a dress today. It's not that abnormal, I do wear skirts every once in a while. Although the last time I worse a dress was to Winter Formal!! It's just too darn hot to wear pants today, and since my sunburn incident I've decided to avoid shorts at all cost!! Even though I do have a pretty decent tan, hmmm maybe all that complaining about being the freakishly pale girl paid off!!  Well ummm I can't think of too darn much else except that Abby's coming to visit!! Wahooo!! New Mexico is way too far away for her to live!! I'm sooo glad she's coming it's going to be sooo cool!! And then Katie's coming home the day after Abby gets here so I'll get to see two of my favorite people!!  Well I'm going to bid you a'deiu so that I can try to get rid of my farmers tan in the 5 minutes before we leave!!   Au Revoir

      Well this is awesome!! I just got back from the Phantom Planet concert. Well actually it was No Doubt and Blink-182, with Phantom Planet as the opener, but still, I went to see them!! So Phantom Planet started early, which sucked a little because not very many people were there to listen to them, but I clapped and yelled so it was all good!! When they played California, a lot of people got up and sung along, so that was cool.   Then No Doubt came on. They were amazing!! Gwen walked down the aisle right next to us, and wow, it was so extremely cool!! She has the greatest speaking voice ever. When she sings her voice is really powerful, but when she talks it's very calm and quite, like a little kids!! Her performance was amazing!! She has an incredible amount of energy, I just couldn't believe it!! I had soooo much fun!! I knew the words to every song they did too, which was very cool!!  During intermission, Annie and I went out and got T-shirts. Mine is very cool, it's the picture from the newest Phantom Planet CD. Then we wandered around for a while.  Ooo and we ran into Brittany and Liz. I haven't seen Liz since 7th grade!! It was very cool, so we talked to them for a while.  Then Blink-182 came on. Wow, I didn't really like them to begin with, but I like them even less now. Now I have nothing against loud music, the louder the better I always say. Well they just pushed it a little too far, the base was way too loud!! I did know most of the songs though, so that did make up for it a little.   A couple songs into their set, Annie and I decided to go outside. So we sat on the grass and played cards. Well after 5 minutes or so, the security people start freaking out, and kept saying, "Don't let anyone in for 10 minutes." So we were trying to figure out what was going on, then out comes the drummer of Blink in a wheel chair!! He took a drink of water from his water bottle and then threw it. Now that in itself seems insignificant, but let me tell you that insignificant act, really made my day!! So the rest of their set was nothing special, but it wasn't terrible. Then at the end of the concert, we were walking out and I decided to grab the watter bottle!!! Oh yes my friends, I now have the water bottle that the drummer from Blink drank out of!!! I may not like the band, but the concept is very cool!!  Oh, and more good new, I got my iPod today!! Now I was going to get the iPod mini, but for $50 more I got 11G more, so it was definitely a better deal!! It's sooo darn cool, and incredibly fast!! It downloaded my entire iTunes library in less than 3 minutes!! So I'm having a great day, although since it's after midnight I should say that yesterday was a great day!!!  Ooooh, and during Blink's set, they did a slower song, and said that in the old days they would ask people to get out their lighters to "set the mood", but that this is the time of technology, and highspeed communication, so they had everyone get out their cell phones!!! It was soo funny because there were just so many of them, the entire place was lit up by cell phones. I laughed quite hard at that!!  So I'm going to go get some ice cream and attempt to get some sleep!!    Au Revoir

      Twas my first official day of summer vacation!!!! Wahoo!! It didn't really feel any different than normal because I don't go to school on Wednesdays anyways, but inside in knew school was out, so that made it all better!  I did lay out in the sun for many an hour and got a brilliant sunburn on my legs!! I knew there was a reason I never wore shorts!! I really hope tis gone by tomorrow too because I'm going to the Phantom Planet concert!  I'm sooo excited about the concert. Phantom Planet is my new favorite band! They're very very good, and they can actually play the guitar unlike many bands today. They were on Pepsi Smash the other day, which thrilled me very much!! And Switchfoot is going to be on tomorrow, but I'm going to miss it. A small sacrifice for great seats at a concert though!!  Well Katie leaves tomorrow at 5 in the morning!! I'm going to miss her so much, she truly did pick the most inopportune time to leave. Hopefully we will be able to manage without each other. It's going to be hard being away from my "twin" for 2 weeks!!  We decided that when she comes back, she, Nicholas, Garrett, and I are going to go paintballing. Well, actually I wasn't involved in this decision, Nicholas just told me about it! It will be brilliant though, and I'm taking bets now on who's going to win. The teams are: Garrett and I Nicholas and Katie Place your bets now for the highest payoffs!!   Betting is for entertainment only, not investment purposes   Wow tis late and someone is outside with a chainsaw doing goodness knows what!! Tis the only bad thing about summer, people stay up till un-Godly hours doing loud things!! Last summer I had my first day of summer vacation ruined by my neighbor. At 7 o'clock sharp, my little neighbor was out on his pogo stick. Mind you this was 7 in the morning on the first day of summer vacation. I wanted to seriously hurt someone. I never liked pogo sticks, and that gave me a justification for my hate of them!!  I have decided to speak in old English, which tis much harder than it sounds!!    Au Revoir   I know that au revoir, is French, and doesn't go along with the old English thing, but alas, I could care less!

      Oh yes my friends, Katie teased me all day long. Granted I did tease her and Nicholas, although not that much!! The entire day, she teased me, it just was not cool.   So we went to the park, which was entertaining!! I'm going to miss everyone sooooo much, but I promise to keep in touch. There are so many crazy things that we all did in that school. It holds so many memories. It's ironic that a place that I dislike so much holds so many of my favorite memories!!  Today, I thought Taylor was being nice, but then I got online tonight. I read her blog, and wow, she was very  very  mean. She continually said that she hated Laura and Emily. Now that's impossible because they are two of the coolest people I know. She used to be out friend, and I always liked her. Then all of a sudden, halfway through the year, she started hanging out with Lauren and Aaron. We thought that she'd just moved on, but it turns out that she has changed into someone that none of us know. Personally I'm not sure if I want to know the new Taylor!!  This afternoon, Katie, Nicholas, and I went to see Harry Potter. It was great!!! I was impressed, I haven't read the book in a while, so I'm not sure how closely it followed it, but from what I can remember it seemed to. After the movie we went to Izzy's and had pizza, which was much fun!! Then we went back to Katie's and went on a long walk. Katie and Nicholas held hands the entire time, and Katie had decided that she didn't care if her parents found out. So on the way back (they were still holding hands), Nicholas was talking about how he was scared of Katie's dad, when all of a sudden Katie turns around. And who drove up behind them, well as luck would have it, it was Katie's dad. They freaked out, so I'm waiting with baited breath as to what he said to Katie!!!  Well that tis all for now, so I shall try to post later!!   Au Revoir   WAHOOOO, SCHOOL'S OUT!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wow, so not too much has happened.   We went on a field trip today and Nicholas and Katie were holding hands the entire time, even on the bus!!! I got such a kick out of it. Sara and I teased them the entire time about it, it was quite entertaining for us!!  I stole one of Emily's CD's and I was listening to it on the bus and guess what song I found!!!!! Okey, first I'll tell you the story. So one night we had Garrett over to watch movies, and we made him watch How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, so we let him watch Italian Job, to make up for it. So we weren't really watching the movie, and he said, "I love this song," or something like that, and I agreed, so we were going to look for it. Neither of us had been able to find a copy of it, UNTIL NOW!!!! Oh yes, so I was listening to Emily's CD, and I was excited because it actually had good music on it, then wham, bam, and on comes "Money", the song from Italian Job. I was soooo excited that I yelled "Oh my gosh" really loud, and everyone started at me but, oh well, I found the song!!! So I'll burn you a copy of it Garrett, and give it to you the next time I see you. Hopefully sooner rather than later!!  The field trip itself wasn't that great, so I'll just skip over that part, although Sara and I did listen to music, and rock out to "Tribute" by Tenacious-D on the way home, so that was all good.   So I'm going to see Harry Potter tomorrow with Katie and Nicholas. I'm sad though because Garrett was supposed to come with us, but he has finals so his mum won't let him!!! Alas.  I've gotta go entertain Katie, before she freaks out and dies of boredom!!   Au Revoir

      Well today started off great!!!! Nick finally asked Katie what everyone knew he was going to. I'm soooo excited for her. She called me right after he asked her, and was freaking out!! It was hysterical to listen to. I'm sooo darn happy for them!!! You could not even begin to comprehend the depth of my happiness for those two!! Laura don't worry, I'll explain it all to you tomorrow or Monday!!!!!  Later it was going good, because I was talking to Garrett and Nicholas. Which is always fun!!! Then somebody decided to call. That somebody turns out to have been Katie's mum. She and my mum talked for an incredibly long time. When they were done my mum came in and said that we needed to "talk". She prefaced our talk by assuring me that it wasn't about boys!! That was one bullet dodged!! So yeah, we got to spend half an hour discussing the "instability" of one of my friends. I am seriously worried about her, and so far nothing either Katie or I have done has worked. So we're all going to talk about it tomorrow.  Tomorrow won't be all bad though, because I'm going swimming with Katie. So that will be great fun, and this time she'll be able to see because she'll have her contacts!!    Au Revoir   P.S.  CONGRATS KATIE AND NICHOLAS!!!!!!! I'M SOOO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!! :)

      Wow, this has truly been the best week in recorded history!!  So I started the week off with a bang. Or Katie started it off with a bang that is! I got some fabulous news from Nicholas, which certainly made my week and hers!! Saturday is just looking better and better!! I got to be a planner of sorts, it was quite interesting actually, I learned a lot!!   Then on Tuesday I got fabulous news myself!! I was quite excited about it actually, and I still keep thinking that it was sort of a dream or just some strange joke!! But I'm starting to believe it now! And it still makes me a little giggly sometimes. It's sort of creepy to actually be acting like a normal teenager. That is something I've never done in my life!!  Then my science final was the easiest thing that I have ever taken. I seriously think I only missed 1, and I'm quite proud of myself. Today the Math final was great, I spent more time going over it than I did taking it. I'm starting to think that I'm crazy or something, because all my finals were sooo darn easy. Then today, I totally freaked myself out by getting 100% on my Spanish final. I'm quite proud of myself actually!!  Then the best news of the entire day: I'm almost positive that I got a 4.0!! I'm so happy, because I actually didn't even have to work that hard this semester. The best thing about getting a 4.0 is that my wonderful father said he'd buy me an ipod!! So I get an ipod, to add to my collection of mp3 players, I have 2 already!! But I'm quite excited about it, because ipods are very cool, even if they are a mac product!!  So I think that is all. If I forgot something, just write a comment, and I'll fix it.   Au Revoir   P.S. All the power to ya Nicholas, and just try to get some sleep tonight!!!!

      I forgot to post earlier, that Katie didn't get her braces off all the way. They're leaving the brackets on for another 3 months!!!! Poor kid! I feel bad for her, although I can't quite know the depth of her pain as I've never experience braces for myself.   Wow, I just saw that Switchfoot is going to be on Pepsi Smash, that's super cool, I can't wait!!   Au Revoir

      Well my world at least!   Today was one of the best days!! My science final was easier than the normal tests!! I finished it in 20 minutes!! I actually knew everything on there, I was quite amazed and impressed. I finished my book though, so I started reading the Geneva Convention, which is 56 pages long, and all in layer-isms!   English was brilliant as well. We turned in our reflection papers. Mine was 2 pages longer than it had to be, but oh well, I had a lot to tell about. What's funny is that most of what I wrote in it has happened within the past month or so. Then we had to read a story, and write our own definition of "ironic". Now that was a little difficult since it can mean so many things!! Mine was a little dumb, but oh well. What's funny is that I have the greatest example of something ironic, and I think everyone reading this will know what I'm talking about. If they were at school with me in 7th and 8th grade that is.  We played this game where Ms. Schultz took 5 people out in the hall and told them a story, and when they came back we would ask then yes or no questions about the setting, characters, and plot. From their answers we were supposed to piece together the story. Well it turns out that they would only say yes, if the last word in your question ended in a y, t, r, or s. I lost interesting the game and went back to reading the Geneva Convention. But I think in the end our story was something about a scitzophrenic guy, who lived on a submarine, that had weird guns, and he was trying to kill himself.  Then I found out that my poor friend Annie, is really sick!!! The poor kid can't eat anything but dry toast and rice! I feel so bad for her, but I'm going to bake her gingersnaps, and everyone knows that my gingersnaps can cure anything!!!  I can't wait till Saturday!!!!   Au Revoir

      Yes my friends I got a strike! I was a little shocked myself. I also got 2 spares I think. Wow, this is the first time I've ever been bowling. Maybe I'll become an olympic bowler, then I could have a cool ball like the lady in the movie, "Mystery Men". Katie was delighted because she beat Nicholas by 1 point. (We've taken to calling him Nicholas because Nick reminds us of Katie's dog).  They were pretty close to unbearable the entire evening. They know why, and several people reading this will know as well. There's something that they're plotting to do, and Katie won't tell me, which is really annoying! Nicholas says it's just payback for all of the times Katie and I keep things from him. Really, there's not too much that we keep from him, except for the 10 years thing, which he'll know about in 10 years anyways so it doesn't matter. He keeps telling me to trust him, but I don't place my trust in others lightly!!  Well there's something else, which has me a little giggly, which I would post about but there's sort of a reason not to!! That reason has taken to reading my blog, so if you want to know, just im me and there's a slim chance I'll tell you.   Oh, and more good news, Katie gets her bottom braces off today!!! She threatened violence if her orthodontist decides not to take them off!!   Well I've got to go study for my science final, so I'll bid you a'deiu!   Au Revoir

      Yup that's me, a good news magnet. Today was a squeek worthy day!!  In science, we did a project with light, which was the most interesting thing we've done all year. The greatest part about it was the bubbles. We got bubble pens. The best thing about them is that the bubble stuff was sticky, so when the bubbles landed on things they wouldn't pop. It was great because we had bubbles all over the floor, and everyone had them in their hair. Ben got them out of my hair for me, which was a little strange.   English was about the same as usual. I talked to Sara, and everyone else got in trouble for talking, but of course not us, never us.   Then came math. Now I was looking forward to math anyway because we were just doing review, so I would get to talk to Katie all period. But we got talking about something. I cannot divulge what we were talking about, but I can say that this is deffinatly where the good news came in! We were both giggly all during class, and whenever we looked at each other we'd crack up!!  So then in history, Katie told Nicholas this something, and he was like, "Go Heather!" All during history I'd just randomly start smiling, it proved to be quite challenging to not start giggling!  Spanish was the same. We finished Monsters Inc. and I still couldn't understand too darn much! Sara, Katie, and I passed notes again, although it wasn't really like passing notes because we tended to talk a lot too.  Then Katie, Nicholas, and Sara helped me figure something out. Let me tell you it was a very hard thing for me. I've sort of been denying it for a while, just like Katie did. I guess we're even more alike than we though.  Then to top it all off, my stuff from Fred Flare came. I got the coolest shirt ever. It's got Jem, from Jem in the Holograms on it. That was my favorite show when I was little, and I was even her for Halloween one year. I also got very cool dangly, bright pink star earings!!  So to make a great day even better, I'm going bowling with Katie and Nicholas tonight!! I haven't been bowling since I was 4 though, so this should prove entertaining to anyone watching. This is just the perfect end to a pretty perfect day!!!   Au Revoir

      Today, I got some great new. Not about me, but about my "twin". Yes, my "twin" is going to be asked out!! What's funny is that he all but asked my permission to go out with her, or at least that's why my friends say. I got to help him figure out how he should ask her since she is my "twin" and all. It's brilliant, I can't wait until the end of the week, preferably Saturday night!!! I shall keep everyone updated  So today we had a party in Spanish. I ate one of Laura's yummy cookieish things, they were quite good. We watched Monster's Inc. en espanol, though the only part I understood was when Mike said, "El bolso. El bolso!!!" That was the only part Katie understood as well, so I don't feel so bad. Katie, Sara, and I passed notes all through class, and we ended up writing 3 pages! It's incredible. I never thought I'd say this, but I actually like being a normal high school girl!!  Oh, and Katie said the most cliche thing today, she actually sounded like a normal high school girl. We were standing outside, and Nick walked over to Melissa because he car-pools with her, and Katie and I were looking at him, and laughing because none of us like Melissa at all. He saw us looking and turned his head, and all of a sudden, Katie says, "Don't look!!" It was sooo funny, I couldn't stop laughing. I guess you just had to have been there, because we tried to explain it to Nick and he just missed the humor.    Au Revoir   P.S.  GO NICHOLAS!!!!!

      Mini-vans are the greatest thing since jello and french fries! So as you know already, we went up to the mountain today, wahoo since it was so cloudy you couldn't even seen it. I was a lucky duck though because I got to stretch out in the back seat, with my music and a book.   Something quite entertaining did happen today though. We went to a visitor's center and they had a telescope set up, pointing in the direction of the mountain. Now this in itself wasn't strange. Then the park ranger told us we should look in it because it's "infrared" so you can see the mountain through the clouds. I was thinking that was a little strange since infrared sees heat, but hey,  I though, maybe he miss-spoke. So my mom looks into it and goes, "Ooooh wow!!!!" So I was like cool that's nice. Then I looked into it, and it was a fake picture, of the mountain  before  it exploded!!! So I was like, "Yeah that's a great view mom...". Then later when we were in the car, she says to my aunt, "It's amazing how clear that picture was!!" and I was like, "Mom you know it was fake right?" and she gives me this blank look and says, "No way, you're kidding!!!" The entire time this conversation took place, she was so serious!! My mother is usually quite intelligent, but I guess even the darkest haired people, can have blonde days!!!  Then we all got in the car, and my dad says, "You're going to make cookies when we get home right?" Now normally that's not a bad thing, because I love to bake and I'm quite good at it, as you know if you've ever had the privilege of eating my Gingersnaps, but I just did not want to bake. I mean who wants to bake after being stuck in the car all day with people who's voices grate on your nerves???? Not me that's for sure. But for some reason I caved and made Snickerdoodles. I think I made them in record time too, I was done with an entire batch in 30 minutes!! They're quite good too. I'll bring some to lunch, so start bugging me now if you want one tomorrow!!  I'm going to go be a carnivore and eat steak for dinner!   Au Revoir

      I got an entire 7 hours of sleep!! That is a large improvement on 3. I'm not too entertaining to talk to when I'm sleep deprived, so sorry about that Garrett and Jo.   I woke up this morning to my mother poking me. That has never happened to me before. I'm always awake before she is. It is a little disconcerting to wake up to someone jabbing you in the arm, especially when you're blind without you contacts, so you have no idea who it is!!  Grrr, this is starting to irritate me. My grandmother, and my aunt are bugging me about not eating enough. Here I am thinking I'm eating more than usual, and they go and tell me that I "eat like a bird". Which is technically incorrect, since birds load up on all the food they can so that they can store it. I seriously don't get it, if you've seen me eat, you know that I do just that,  eat !!!   So today we're going to the mountain. Another day of sitting in the car reading and studying for finals, but this time I'm going to bring along my music! I was trying to be polite yesterday, by leaving it at home, but I've decided that that was just a dumb thought.   I will regale you with a tale about my trip to the mountain when I return,  if  I return.   Au Revoir

      My father just informed me that I have a boyfriend. Now this is news to me since currently all of my friendships with people are just that, friendly!!! I told him that I was going to see Harry Potter with Katie and Nick, I didn't even mention anyone else, probably because I know better. So he said, "I guess now that you have a boyfriend, you're not going to go to movies with me anymore?" I've gotten to the point where I just smile and nod my head, no one believes me anymore, so I say screw it!!! The world can believe what it pleases, I personally don't care anymore!!!

      Wow, now this is sad.   I was up until 3 talking to Garrett last night. I didn't think that would be too much a problem since supposedly I wouldn't have to leave until 9 this morning so I wouldn't have to get up until 8. But oh no, not with little old women in the house. They were up and taking showers at 6!! I think I'd be lucky if I got 3 hours of sleep. Impressively enough I'm not too tired. I'll just consider this practice for when I go to college far, far away.   Oh, and Garrett, I'm sorry I got off, you just were gone for a while, and I was starting to nod off!! Did you ever come back???  Well I've got to go. We're having breakfast.    Au Revoir   P.S. Sorry about the short, abrupt sentences. You should just be happy that they're coherent.

      Yes, it is 2 in the morning and I am still talking to Garrett online. We have been talking for 4 hours. I have never talked to anyone that long, ever!!! It's a new record for me. We have talked about everything from hacking to poodles, and somehow about being related. The latter I really don't understand, but hey it's freakishly late, or early depending on how you look at it.   Then he started a chat room, where I talked to him and his friend Jeremiah, quite a neat character I might add. He did call me a cynic though, personally I believe I just have a sharp wit! Then Garrett would stop talking so I'd talk to Jeremiah for a while, and then I'd threaten to leave so Garrett would say something. Yes my friends, this conversation provided me with some serious entertainment. Then again anything is entertaining at 2 in the morning. So then we left the chat room, and Garrett said he wasn't talking because it was fun to watch Jeremiah and me talk. He equated us to "two monkeys fighting each other for a banana." I think he was being very philosophical tonight. I never realized how truly philosophical, and entertaining he is. We found out that we do have a strangely large amount of things in common.  Anyways, the babbling has begun so I will bid you a'du.   Au Revoir

      Today was quite fascinating. My relatives flew in this morning from phoenix. I wish I lived in phoenix, it would be warm all the time. But not the humid hot, but the nice and dry hot, then I wouldn't need a faux-fur coat!  School was dumb. I hate saying that because it's so cliche, but it's true. Math was cool, because we just did review for our final next week. History was the best class for once because we had a sub, and we got to read for half the class, then break into groups to do a work sheet. Spanish was frightful. We had a test today, and I didn't know several words on there, and I think I conjugated one of them incorrectly, but alas I shall get over it.   I get to spend the entire weekend with my relatives. Which normally wouldn't be bad because I don't get to see them very often, but it's finals next week. So I'm super stressed out, and I have a ton of studying to do. But no I don't get to sit peacefully in my room, with extremely loud music and study. No I get to go sight seeing with them, squished in my car!! I love them very very much, but this was a very bad week to visit.   I'm skipping around topics, but lunch was very entertaining! Because Garrett told Katie that she should ask Nick out, and Katie said something about it in front of Nick. So all day he was trying to figure it out, but no one would tell him. We told most of the girls in our "clique" but not him. So at lunch, he moved over by me and said, "Did Garrett tell Katie to ask me out?" It was so funny though because right then, Katie said that she would tell him!!! It seems to be, that you had to have been there to really get the full entertainment out of it!! They just provide me with such entertainment. One day Garrett and I will get a picture of them though, it will be "un momento de Kodak".   Well I may not be able to post for the rest of the weekend, due to the wonderful familial obligations, but I shall put in every effort to. Not that reading about our sight seeing will be very fun since everyone has already seen the sights!   Au Revoir

      We live in a mad, mad world, where big, fuzzy haired people are fawned over!!!  I just had a brilliant idea!! I am going to purchase a hat for my lovely friend Katie, she just looks great with them backwards!!! I'm sure that Nick and Garrett agree with me!  So anyways, I just had the strangest conversation with Nick, he was like "I sort of wish you liked someone, it's bugging me" seriously, this is just getting strange. First Katie tries to set me up with Garrett, now this, seriously, I think that someone in this world wants me to have a boyfriend!!  So anyways, let's move away from my personal life, or lack there of and onto more interesting matters.  I went to the dentist today, and for the first time, my hygenist did not berate me for not flossing. I was so amazed that I think I'm going to begin flossing. It must be some new for of reverse psychology. I honestly believe that they should just pay people to floss. It would be a win win situation: the hygenists wouldn't have as much work to do, and you would get paid. It is a brilliant plan, maybe I shall become a hygenist!!! Scratch that, you have look in people's mouths, and that's disgusting. What if they have a thing for broccoli, and not brushing their teeth. Then they will have lovely green pieces in their teeth!!! Not that I have anything against broccoli, I personally like broccoli almost as much as I do jello!!   Au Revoir

       That is suuuuuch a pathetic title, but hey tis the extent of my creativity today!!      So my dad and I went to see the Bourne Supremacy, which is pretty darn good! It wasn't quite as good as I expected but they could have done a lot worse!! The action scenes were really good, they were incredibly well choreographed! It's great ever since I started taking fencing, I pay attention to the choreography of the fights more than I did before!! The plot is a little bit predictable, but personally I believe that they have to dumb down many movies for the sake of today's movie going audience!!      Mmmm, I just haven't felt too inspirational lately!!      Oh, I watched Harold and Maude last night, and wow, that is a great movie!!! Now movies from the 70s are great to begin with, but it was just soooo abnormal that I loved it!! I think that I'm going to model my life after Maude's!! So when I'm old, I hope to be like her. Just driving off in other people's cars to remind them not to get too attatched to their possessions. Digging up trees because they are being suffocated by the smog in the city, and then replanting them!! Oh man she is just the coolest lady ever!!!      Well I'll come back later and try to be inspirational, but for now I'll leave you with these parting words from Harold and Maude:          Harold:    You sure have a way with people.       Maude:    Well,they're my species!            I just love that movie, you should all really see it sometime!!! And Sara, personally I'm a fan of the morals I think they're great!!!

      Mmmm, yes this is totally maudeness!!!  I've decided to not post about our trip, because, well quite frankly that will be very time consuming on the part of both parties. So to be courteous to everyone, I'll not post. If you really want to know then just ask me in person, on the phone, or im me. But really nothing to interesting happened.....Hahahaha I didn't think you'd believe that for a second, but it was worth a try!!  So nothing much happened today actually. It has been one of my few uneventful days. Garrett, I now know how you feel, when you say you have nothing to post a about.  We did decide to watch Harold and Maude, (hence the "Maudeness") so I got to wander on over to the movie place. I do love that place sooooo darn much, they have provided me with hours of entertainment. The movie guy did look at me like I was a total freak though! I'm not too sure why that is, although it may have something to do with my large bright pink star earrings I was wearing! Why those are stare worthy I'm not too sure though.  Laura has really caused me to feel that I should actually have meaningful posts. So I'll try to have at least one meaningful post a day, although that plan may fall through!!  I'm off to go running, so........   Au Revoir     Currently listening to:  the sounds of my keyboard   Oh, and to explain the Maudeness, I was going for madness. Because it is madness that I decided to not post about something that is so utterly entertaining!!

Hahaha I find that hysterical. I've heard some very interesting stuff about that trip, but I'm sooooo not going to post it!!!

And how much Mr. Clapp hated us because we were always laughing!!! Those were the good old days!!! Well for us anyways. I'll still never forget it Garrett, even in 10 years I'll still feel bad about it!!!   Oh, I can't wait until Tuesday!!! Hahahaha, we're going to have soooo much fun. Emily, Laura, Sara, and I are going to the beach!! We're staying at Laura's beach house which is within walking distance of everything!!!!

       The dreadful kids across the street with the pogo stick are back at it again!!!!     &nbsp;   Okay so story time (sorry Laura&nbsp;I know&nbsp;I copied you, that was the only thing I could think of). On the first day of summer vacation, these lovely children were out at 7 a.m. sharp on their pogo sticks!!!! Of course I had my windows open because that's what you do in the summer!! And of course I was trying to sleep in because again, that's what you do on the first day of summer vacation!!! So I was rudely awakened by a pogo stick!!!     Anyways as you can tell I'm still bitter about that whole thing, and many a night I have spent planning how to destroy that pogo stick without incriminating myself.&nbsp; And they're at it again!!! So soon I might be enlisting one of my great friends to help me destroy the pogo stick!!!  Well anyways, that was interesting!!

       This is great! So I just put one of my favorite CDs onto the computer, The Three Calamities by Switchblade Symphony, and whenever I listen to it, it reminds me of a book. When I first got this CD I was reading  The Vampire Lestat  (which is an excellent book by the way) so of course I listened to my new CD while reading my new book. So whenever I hear any song off of this CD I always thing of that book!! I do them same thing when I listen to Without You I'm Nothing, by Placebo, that CD makes me think of one of the books by Poppy Bright. It's just funny how your brain associates things like that!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Anmorata, Switchblade Symphony

       Man I wish that I'd thought of counting the sheep last night or was it this morning......     &nbsp;   Now I'm quite adept at staying up late and then being perfectly awake the next day, but I guess that skill failed me today!! So I went to bed around 1:30, which isn't really that late, but I then couldn't fall asleep!! I just ended up doing  a lot &nbsp;of thinking!! But really sleep would have been a good thing, since I had to get up at 8!! I think all in all I ended up getting like 5 or 6 hours. I guess I'll just consider this practice for when I go off to&nbsp;college and party all night! !! Hahaha, like I'd do that!!     &nbsp;   Not too much happened today, although I am trying to put my entire CD collection on to my computer!!! That task is taking forever!! I have an incredibly large collection. Seriously no one should have as many CDs as I do, especially such a wide variety!!!     &nbsp;   Oh, this is good. I found a  ton &nbsp;of dance/rave music on my computer!!! I think it ended up there when I borrowed one of Ben's CDs. But really I'm not sure. I seem to end up with all sorts of weird stuff on my computer!!     &nbsp;   Well I'm off to go finish putting my CDs on, 20 down and a ton more to go!!!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Naked Birthday, Switchblade Symphony

       The brilliance of Krispy Kreme.     &nbsp;   Don't have the time to eat a doughnut, why not drink one?     &nbsp;   Yes my friends it is true. Krispy Kreme has come out with the drinkable doughnut.&nbsp;It comes in several flavors, one being the classic, glazed doughnut flavor. As an added bonus you also get the 300 calories&nbsp;per drink just like you do in the real&nbsp;doughnut. So in the end you're only sacrificing the need to digest it. So in this fast paced world, you're saving one step! Hmmm, now about that breathing thing......    &nbsp;   Wow, hmmm, that was a good sales pitch,&nbsp;I think I'll email that to them and see if I can get them to buy it from me.&nbsp;I could make my millions while I'm still&nbsp;young enough to enjoy it!!!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Catch me, The Bandits

       That is all I can say. My mum and I just got back from seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 and wow, that is an awesome documentary!! It's&nbsp;a tad scary&nbsp;though, it really is.     &nbsp;  Michael Moore explains how many&nbsp;many people in the white house are connected through certain "business ventures". It explains in detail, how a business that Cheny is&nbsp;a large investor in has gotten many of the oil contracts in Iraq, gee go figure! This is something that I just couldn't believe, the entire Bin Laden family was flown out of the U.S. right after September 11. The CIA helped them leave so that they wouldn't have to worry about being treated poorly.&nbsp; Now that in itself isn't  that  bad but when you add this next part into the equation it becomes  that &nbsp;bad. Many of Bush's early businesses (which all failed by the way) are suspected to have been funded by Iraqi oil money. Before becoming president, he was on the board of a company that the Binladen family invested heavily in. I should add that&nbsp;although the&nbsp;Bin Laden family didn't speak to Osama very often there were a few occasions in the past few years where they did speak. Seriously,&nbsp;when someone commits a murder the first thing you do is talk to the family of the suspect&nbsp;to find out if they know about their whereabouts.     &nbsp;   So I guess that it's good to be friends with the president because hey, if someone you're related to someone who kills thousands of people, he'll help you get out of the country to avoid being questioned!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   I really would recommend that movie to everyone. It was awesome! Now granted it is a Michael Moore film so it does need to be taken with a grain of salt, but many of the things there are irrefutable fact. Watching it is just scary, considering there are so many things that the government has done!!!     &nbsp;   This is interesting, for the first 9 months in office, Bush spent 47% of the time ON VACATION!!!!! He babbled about "doing work" but c'mon how much work can someone with such a short attention span do when he's in Texas and could be golfing instead?!?!     &nbsp;   Okay I'll stop before I really get going, but ya'll really should go see the movie, it's really good, even if you don't agree with Michael Moore's views, it is really quite informative!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Fireproof, Pillar

       So my mum and I were driviing somewhere today and we drove by a sign that said, "It's your nickel watch it work." I just found that hysterical, I was laughing and my mum couldn't figure out why! Now I found this so entertaining because Katie's dog has the same name as her boyfriend. Or at least Nickel is Nick's nickname! Anyways whenever I see that sign, I think of when we were at Katie's house and her dad goes, "Nick OUTSIDE!" and poor Nick thought that her dad was talking to him not the dog!! It was great and sooo darn funny!!     &nbsp;  Well I'm going to go make a smoothie!    &nbsp;   Au Revoir       &nbsp;  Currently listening to:    Fireproof, Pillar     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

Wow, this is just a summer of killer music!!!

       I'm having fun saying that because it makes me feel like I'm the weather person, which of course is my major goal in life!!     &nbsp;   Oh I'm pleased to inform you that I will be taking up a career in sketch comedy, and joining Saturday Night Live!!! Although Garrett did inform me that I will be tired on Sunday morning, but I think I can deal with that!! Ooooo, maybe I could replace Tina Fey on Weekend Update!! That would be ever so cool!!! Wow, hmmm, I'm thinking this is becoming a better and better idea!!     &nbsp;   But if that plan falls through, and the neurosurgeon plan falls through, never fear, for I've got a back up plan!! Yes my friends a back up, and this back up plan is something that every little kid dreams of doing! I'll join the circus!!! Hence my goal of learning to juggle!!

       So yeah this is not good. As you know Katie is leaving tomorrow for Florida and she'll be gone for a week, and as soon as she gets back she's going to the beach. Well she's going through serious withdrawals because she'll not be able to see Nick for an entire 2 weeks!! So Garrett, Nick, and I were going to surprise her by meeting her at the airport tomorrow. This would have been the greatest this ever, seriously it would have been awesome!! But of course Nick can't go!!! How dreadful is that!!! It's just sad, I mean Katie would have been soooo happy!! So now she just has to make do with Garrett and I when who she really wants is Nick!! Alas I got her lime flavored chocolate for the trip so that should make her happy since she currently is obsessed with lime/kiwi flavored things. Yes for those of you who know, that is just like blueberries, strawberries, and bananas.     &nbsp;   Hahaha, oh I just realized that I need to come up with a new one now!! Hmmm, maybe starfruit!!     &nbsp;   Well I'm off to think of different berries and fruits!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Fireproof, Pillar

       Today was quite entertaining, at least for my twisted sense of humor it was!     &nbsp;   So my mum and I went to the grocery store today and we made fun of the food, it was funny!!! There was some weeeird looking stuff, and we went on and on about it and just cracked up, it was great!!! Anyways, we were going along and I stopped and I said, "Tuna, tuna we have to have tuna for dinner!" So we wandered down the tuna isle and made jokes about tuna (yes  some  people are still talking about what Jessica&nbsp;Simpson said about tuna)&nbsp;and some gross cheese covered stuff.&nbsp; Then we went and got yogurt, and I found out that they have several new flavors which makes me extraordinarily happy!! Then since it was really hot and gross today we decided to get some ice cream. And of course urlLink  Ben and Jerry's  was on sale so you have to get 2 and then there was this other yummy cheesecake berry flavored stuff so we had to get that too. So we got 3 things of ice cream. Honestly the only healthy thing we got was the yogurt!!     &nbsp;   Oh, and this is great, when we were walking into the store I had a total Marilyn Monroe moment!! It's quite toasty so I decided to wear a skirt, and it's flouncy and made of light fabric, and wow, that was interesting!!!     &nbsp;   Also, since it's hot my mum won't let me use the oven to bake anything. So I've decided that I'm going to try to learn how to bake cookies on the grill!!! Haha, I think that would be great, if I figure it out I can have my own cooking show, just like Jamie Oliver!!!!     &nbsp;   Anyways that's all, I'm going to go have some tuna salad!!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir      &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Legionnaire's Lament, The Decemberists

Now honestly it took me a looooong time to get it out of her! In the end it didn't matter, I got a kick out of it anyways!!!  Then randomly someone imd me and I thought it was Brandon, but no, it turned out to be Matt Byerly. I got a kick out of that since  I don't think I ever spoke 2 words to him last year in school. Anywho it was entertaining, so all is well. It was quite late though, or early when I finally did get to bed.

So we kicked off our week and a half of freedom by watching a movie and&nbsp;eating popcorn which was very entertaining!! &nbsp;      Well now here is something fun and exciting! On Thursday my mum and I might go see Fahrenheit 911!!!! I really hope we do!! I've been wanting to see it since it came out, and so has she, my dad just didn't want to see it. So here is our golden opportunity!!! Hopefully we will follow the yellow brick road and go see the movie!

Well anyways she was having withdrawals because she hadn't talked to Janessa (her best friend) in a very long time. So she asked me to call Janessa, and let me tell you that I met Janessa  once &nbsp; last year, and I doubt she&nbsp;remembers me. So anyways I got to randomly call a person that I don't know, and try to convince her to get online so that Sara could talk to her.     &nbsp;   I wonder if she ever got online, or if she took me for an escapee, and reported me to the nearest "happy house"! Anyways Sara gets back tomorrow, so I'll be able to find out if she ever did get to talk to Janessa!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     All For You, Jonah 33

       Sand and wind are definitely at the top of that list!!     &nbsp;   So today we all went to the beach, and it was sooooo much fun! By&nbsp;"we all" I mean Garrett, Katie, Nicholas, and I, well Katie's mum, brother, and her brother's friend went, but they really don't count! Hahaha, I'm joking don't worry!     &nbsp;   We started out at Cannon Beach, and let me tell you sand and wind are not very good friends, they really need to sit down with each other and have a chat to work things out! We walked around the beach for a while, and it was all good. Then&nbsp;Nick drug Katie quite far into the water, and they got soaked, seriously from the waist down they were wet!! Garrett and I were the only smart ones, and we didn't really get too wet!!     &nbsp;   After we'd become sick of being in the middle of the quarrel between the sand and wind we got back into the van, bringing half of the beach with us, and drove off to Seaside. We wandered around there for a while, which was, ummmm, well entertaining I guess! Oh well, Nick and Garrett found out about the whole 10 years thing, which originally Katie and I were only going to tell them about in 10 years!! Oh well, what can I say it was late when we came up with it, so please forgive us!     &nbsp;   Then on the way home, Nick and Garrett fell asleep, and Katie took some lovely pictures of that! We walked around Katie's neighborhood for a while when we got back. I think Nick and Katie have an uncanny love of walking, it's just abnormal!     &nbsp;   Wow, this is great, as soon as Nick left my house, I took the longest bath ever!!! Okey so not really, but wow, it was soo nice to be clean again, I swear I still have sand in between my toes, but alas! It was a small price to pay for such a great day!!!     &nbsp;   Anyways, well here are some pics from the trip, only 2 since I had much more important things to do than take pictures!!     &nbsp;   urlLink     All of us on the beach, with the funny rock thing in the background, haha, you can sort of tell by the fact that we're all squinting that it is really windy!!  &nbsp;   urlLink     And here is poor Nicholas sleeping. I guess Katie is just too high maintenance for him!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Okey well that's all for now! Well except thanks for asking!!!!! :) It was much appreciated, and made me one of the happiest people!!  &nbsp;   Au Revoir     &nbsp;  Currently listening to:   Worldwide: One, Audio Adrenaline

       The words uttered by Marlin Brando now pertain to my life!     &nbsp;   This is horrible!!! The poor little kitten that decided to take a liking to us is laying in front of my front door!!!! I feel terrible! My parents won't let me keep her, I mean I understand why, obviously, but still, it's just not very nice!!!! She's lonely and just wants a nice home!! But poor Stella&nbsp;(which is what I decided to name her) will have to be lonely forever!! She'll always have&nbsp;a void in her heart waiting to be filled with love and affection, that she was never given as a kitten!!     &nbsp;   Alright then, haha, that was entertaining, but alas, poor Stella!!!!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     The Difference, Jonah 33

This is just sad, nothing should ever last that long!! It's crazy!!!     &nbsp;   This is sooo off topic! We have our garage door open and a kitten just ran through the garage and into the backyard!!! It's the cutest kitten, but alas, I can't keep it!! Oh well!

       Yes my friends holy cow!! So somehow I got sucked into weeding today, not a favorite thing of mine! Anyways, well I was out there weeding, and my dad walks over and says, "Heather ya know it would be a lot easier to do that if we "cut back" some of these plants," Now those are words that I have been longing to hear!!! I hate the corner flower bed, because it's not even a flower bed it's a lavender bed!! My mum is obsessed with lavender so she decided to plant like 4 different kinds in one flower bed. So we just started cutting away!!! Haha, it was soo entertaining! I gave up part way through because I sort of became useless, and I went inside to take a shower. This is just sad I had pieces of lavender in my hair!!!! Maybe I'll be able to plant nice flowers when we're done with this!!! I have really learned to despise lavender, and my mum will probably now disown me for saying that!!     &nbsp;   Well I'll tell everyone about the Classic tomorrow!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     Princes of the Universe, Queen

       Wow, I'm really not having a good day today!!     &nbsp;   I found out this morning that Garrett can't come on Sunday, which would have made the entire day more enjoyable. Then my&nbsp;IM program messed up, causing me to not be able to talk to Garrett. Now, since Amaznon.com partnered with Borders, I'm not going to be able to use my Borders gift certificate online. Finally, I have to go pull weeds!!! Honestly,&nbsp;tis not a good day for me! Alas, at least I've got Monday to look forward too, that'll be a ton of fun!     &nbsp;    Au Revoir        &nbsp;   Currently listening to:     History Repeating,&nbsp; Propellerheads and Miss Shirley Bassey

       This is really really strange!! Earlier I was talking to Garrett online and then all of a sudden he couldn't see anything that I was typing! So I restarted Trillian, and then logged back on and he still couldn't' see what I was typing so I restarted my computer and while it was restarting I logged onto the other computer, and still it wouldn't work!! So when I got back on Laura was on, but she could see what I typed, but Garrett still couldn't!!!! Sometimes Trillian just is not cool!     &nbsp;   So I had fencing class this morning and it was very very fun!!! We actually got to learn a ton of new stuff today! Yeah I had a blast, it's just a really cool thing to do!

       Fridays are just great days! So first I will recount the tales of why this Friday is special!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The first reason being:  As you know I went to Katie's so that we could have "girls night" which was great fun I might add. So when I got there we watched several episodes of Gilmore Girls, as is our tradition since I bought the entire first season on DVD. Then we decided that we'd get on line for a while, and of course no one was on! Well Katie G. was on and we found out that she broke up with her boyfriend, which Katie and I were sort of sad about, but Katie really doesn't like Katie's boyfriend (haha that's a hard sentence to understand!) and I don't know him, so I'm quite impartial on the whole situation. Then we grabbed a lovely bowl of ice cream!! It was really good, one of them had like the yummy cookie part of oreos in it, oooo it was quite tasty!! I always contend that the way to make a girl happy is to give her great ice cream! So we ate lovely amounts of ice cream, and of course watched more Gilmore Girls. Which I might add is one of the greatest shows ever created!! So currently Katie and I are Princess Lorelei and Princes Kassy!! It's yet another joke to go into  The Book.   &nbsp;  Well then after I think 2 more episodes we moved from ice cream to cookies!! They were quite tasty too!! Hahaha, and yeah we had a great conversation about corn starch and saying thank you, which are 2 more jokes that went into  The Book  that evening!! Well finally around 2 a.m. we finished the entire first season!!! This is sad because it's something that we've been working on for the past several months!!! Alas all good things must come to an end. Actually there are several good things right now that I intend to never let come to an end, but that's another story!  &nbsp;  Well then we talked forever of course!!! Haha, and what we talked about I don't even know!! Hahaha, we didn't end up even trying to go to sleep until 2:30, but oh well that's half the fun!! So we ended up getting 6.5 hours of sleep!!  &nbsp;  And now another reason for loving Fridays:  My dad once got an email entitled "Friday Dance" and it was this little stick figure who danced around and said, "It's Friday, It's Friday". Well ever since that email, he comes into my mum's office and does the Friday dance and then gives us yummy stuff from the local bakery!!! Well anyways so today was a special occasion so we got eclairs!!! They're soo good, I've only been able to eat 1/4 of mine!!&nbsp;Wahoo this was just great for me considering the great amounts of cookies I'd devoured the night before!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;Well there is one sort of bad thing about today though. I'm not going to be able to go to Laura's play because both my parents have to work late! Alas. I will get the house all to myself for several more hours, so I'm a happy camper!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;To end on a good note: The new stuff added to blogger is&nbsp;awesome!! Or at least I think it's pretty cool, it's not going to change anything, but it still looks cooler now!! Besides&nbsp;I'm a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;making lists, so now that there are bullets, that'll be easier to do!!! &nbsp; Oh well I'm going to post some pics from last night, but I'll do that later, so for now this is adieu!&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;Au Revoir &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Currently listening to:     Night Shift, Orangestick

      Hahaha, I think I'm going to invent a "Happy Thursday Dance"!!! Yes I'm quite thrilled that it's Thursday.   First off Katie and I are having girl's night tonight!!! I can't wait, we always have sooooo much fun when we do that!!   Then tomorrow is Friday need I say more! Well actually I should say more about why I'm happy it's Friday, but I imagine that most of you can figure out why I'd be happy!! So enough said on that point!  Also it being Thursday means that it's one day closer to Sunday!! I'm quite excited about the Classic, it's sooo much fun!! The Grand Prix is awesome, I swear that's the day when everyone goes more to socialize than to actually watch!! Yeah, so I'm quite excited for that!! Plus hopefully Garrett will be coming, which would make it much more entertaining!  Well that's all for now because I have to go play secretary for my mum. Hopefully I'll get fired soon.

      Well poor Katie, she just had a dreadful day today!!!  She had to go get her tetanus shot, because we're supposed to get them for school next year (not that I'm getting mine mind you). So she wasn't too keen on that whole thing, so when she got there, the nurse was asking her if she was alright because she was looking a tad pale. Then she said the dumbest thing that has ever been uttered by anyone, "You don't like getting shots do you?" Seriously who would ever answer yes to that question!?!?!?! Anyways after Katie had informed her that no, she doesn't like getting shots, they talked for a while, and then wham!!! she stabbed Katie in the arm. Now Katie thought she was doing okay, she said it was hurting a little, but not too badly. Well when she stood up she felt a tad dizzy, and the next thing she knew, she was on the ground with her mum and the nurse saying "Katie, Katie, wake up honey." The poor thing had passed out!!!! Now the closest I've ever come to passing out is when I stand up too quickly, but that's only because I have low blood pressure, I can't imagine what it would be like!!! So she called me, and to hear her tell it is just the funniest thing!!! She's got such a special sense of humor that when she says it it's just twice as funny!!!!  So to make up for her passing out we're having "girls night" tomorrow!!! It's going to be sooooo much fun!!! I'm bringing over season one of Gilmore Girls and then we're going to go rent chick flicks!!! We're going to totally eat ice cream and cookies, and just have a ball!!!! This is going to be soooo much fun, I just love when we do this!! I know, I know, I don't really strike anyone as the type of person who would like doing that, but hey I'm aloud to surprise everyone once in a while!!!  Well I hope that everyone has a grand evening!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  What I Like About You, The Romantics

      Hahaha, this is great, and such a typical thing for me. So I was changing my profile and I looked at the picture of me, and I came to a great realization (besides noticing the fact that I look like a librarian with my glasses on!!) I realized that the Monet painting behind me is crooked!!! I see that thing every time I walk into my room, yet still I didn't notice it was crooked until I saw it in a picture!! I also realized that I don't really like any of the colors on the paint chip that is tacked to my wall next to the Monet!!   I think that from now on I'm going to just walk around taking pictures of things, because that seems to be the only way for me to actually  see  things!!! Hahaha, so I now feel bad for all of my camera shy friends, because I fully intend to take many pictures of them now that I've come to this grand realization!!

      Well, I was woken up this morning at 5 by a lovely thunder storm!! It was really cool actually, and it started raining too, and there is nothing like the smell of rain when it's been dry!! So I woke up and looked outside and the sky looked really cool because the sun was just coming up but we were having a storm, well being the person I am I decided to take pictures of it. Well I couldn't very well do that through teh screen in my window, so I took the screen out, and took pictures for an hour!! It was very cool to see the sky change soooo much. So anyways here are a few of the pics:    urlLink    So was taken right after the rain and thunder stopped.   urlLink    This was during the thunder storm, so you can see the cool thunder clouds, and the sun coming up.   urlLink    Not too sure when I took this one, but hey it was early so you'll have to forgive me.    urlLink    Forgive the house and tree, and the street light, but this picture was at a really odd angle!!   urlLink    Okay well this one's pretty cool too, I've got a thing for finding pictures in clouds!   Okay well that's all that I feel like putting up for now, but I might add more later!! Oh and since I find it so entertaining to find pictures in clouds, tell me what you see in them!!

So my mum decided to watch one and then of course we sort of got hooked. It's sort of a reality thing about this salon in Beverly Hills, and wow, it's sooo darn entertaining, in a mind numbing sort of way!! Anyways, well today was the season finale, and when they were doing a "montage" about how the salon is doing great and everything, they played "More Than Fine" by Switchfoot!!! I thought that was the coolest thing ever!!! Yeah so I just thought that was the coolest thing ever!!

Well Lauren got a chalet this year, which is really cool, last year we just had a patron's tent, so it's going to be soooo much fun!!!! I was going to invited Garrett, Katie, and Nicholas, but as Katie's not going to be here, that leaves Nicholas and Garrett, and I'm not too sure that Nicholas would want to go without Katie, which then leaves Garrett. Now personally I'd not mind inviting him, although I'm not too sure how keen he'd be on the idea of spending the day with my family!!! Besides the poor kid will have just gotten back!

Well today I was starting a load of laundry and I was putting in a scoop of the soapy stuff, (it smells like snuggle dryer sheets by the way!!) when I dropped the container!!! Now my first thought is how long it will take me to sweep all of that up!! Then when I finally get brave enough to open my eyes and look, I see that the container is right side up!!!! This is the first time in my entire life that I've beaten one of Murphy's Laws!!!!   Oh, and to make this even better, this is my 100th post!!! In a way it feels like my birthday!!

Okay well I left my lunch in the car today and I didn't get it out until noon, so it had been sitting in the car for 3 hours. Now that didn't harm my chips and salsa, or my rice crackers, but it did harm the greatest thing in my entire lunch, my jello!!!! My poor poor jello was melted!! It was a liquid, it had gone from the jiggly, almsost but not quite solid state, to the liquid state!! So I put it in the freezer, well just now I got it out. So it had been chillin in the freezer for 2 hours!! Well let me tell you frozen jello is awesome!!!! It's still a little jiggly and it's just so cool!! It's more solid than the usual, and it's sort of like a jiggly sorbet!!! Haha, so from now on, I'm going to freeze all of my jello!!!  Well that's all for now!!! I'm off to give Katie a ring!

Now as you all know I dislike my name with the fire of a thousand suns, but I've not been able to come up with anything better to change it to. For a while I was going to go with Sidney, then there was Caroline, but of course none of those really fit. But now, I've got the ultimate name right at my fingertips. Sunshine!!! Honestly how cool would it be to have the name "Sunshine Early"?!?!?! Okay, okay, so I may sound crazy, but hey my name would sound crazy too!!

      So today I had to get up bright and early because my mum and I had to go watch people school cross-country at Lake Oswego. Ewww, I really don't like doing that!! These people drive me craaaazy, and at 8:30 a.m. it doesn't take too much to drive me crazy!! Well most of the kids did a good job with their horses, but the girl whose pony I am training did a dreadful job!! I wanted to scream!! She was ruining all of the work that I've done in the past several months!! It was really really hard to watch!! Anyways yeah, she did dreadful, but the others were really good so that made up for it. When they were done, I had to ride the pony for the irritating girl, and he was really good, so personally I just don't think that he likes her, which really isn't that hard to do!! Then I got volunteered to ride someone else's horse. I was just in high demand today!!  Then I needed long pants for fencing so we had to go to the mall!! I don't really like the mall, I like a select few stores, but that's it. Otherwise there is no appeal of the mall at all!! I much prefer 23rd street, but that's just me. So we wandered around forever and couldn't find a single pair of pants!! Either they were too heavy, or they were too big!!! I swear it's like all of the smalls in the world are just gone!!! But then when we were walking back, we walked past this store call  urlLink Hollister . It looked pretty cool from the outside, although a little bit like Abercrombie which I really really don't like!! But we went in anyways, and wow, it was an awesome store!!! I got the coolest pair of pants!! They're like a greenish teal color and they're corduroy!!! I also got a really cool green shirt to go with it!! They're the greatest pants ever!!!! So yeah even though I ended up buying a pair of running pants that were too big, it was a good day!! Although Garrett did call while I was gone and he had to talk to my dad, but oh well!  I'm off to try to eradicate my farmer's tan!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  Dead Disco, Metric

      Well as some of you know my first fencing class was today. It was actually really cool!!! There's only 2 girls in the entire class, me and a lady who's a grandmother!! So we've got this pact going that we'll kick the guy's butts!!   So for most of the class we learned the history of fencing, and about the different types of swords, which was really cool! I never realized how much the design of the swords evolved to the swords that are used today!! Then for the last 10 minutes we got to use wooden dowls and learned first position, and some 5 step thing, and then the salute! It was really easy for me though, because of horse riding my legs are really strong, and then because of pilatis my posture is brilliant!! So it's going to be really fun!!! Yeah I'm quite excited for next week, although I'm sort of wondering who I'll end up partnering with!  This was hysterical, we were at Fred's today and I saw this guy with a lady's purse over his shoulder walking around talking on a  huge  walkie-talkie!! It was the funniest thing, I wish that I'd had my camera with me!!! Then we ran over to grab my saddle real quick and we saw these two kids walking down the road with a wagon, and inside the wagon was a little boy and a laundry basket, and inside the laundry basket was a chicken!!! It was soooo cute!!  So that's all for now!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  Tribute, Tenacious D

Actually to be completely correct they're not tacos they're burritos, but el burrito noche sounds a tad awkward, so I'll stick to taco!  So today was yet quite uneventful, which for me, is a rarity, I seem to have the most entertaining things happening to me!!  I did take several really pointless quizzes though! I've found out that were I to marry a celebrity it would be none other than Brad Pitt, I'd never make it in the mob, that my socks do party while I'm gone, that I'm quite smart, and that I do have some lovely blonde moments!! So yeah, in case you were wondering about any of those things, now you know!! So the whole sock partying thing might be why I have a sock fetish, I like socks almost as much as shoes, but not quite!!  Well that's really all that I can think of, so I think I will take my leave now and go do something productive!

      Haha, again I added -ness to the end of a word, I'm quite proud of myself!! Ack, this is irritating, the keyboard that I am using is terrible, all of the keys stick, so I can't type very fast!!!   Well anyways I've not really done anything today at all, I feel the need to do something profound though!! Alas, maybe I'll find something cool to do soon!!   Oooo, fencing starts on Saturday and I hopefully get to wear pants called "knickers", hahaha, wouldn't that be the greatest thing ever?!?!?!  Well then, I've got nothing left to say except that ya'll need to post comments, because those are quite entertaining to read!!!

      Wow, well today was a  ton  of fun!!! So Katie, Laura, Nicholas, Johanna, and I all hung out with Abby today, and wow, let me tell you that was quite entertaining!!!  So when we got there, we all just hung out waiting for Abby, and she was a tad late, so we all just hung out around the door, which was a little strange!! Then when she got there, everyone went upstairs and we just hung out for a while!! We talked about the strangest things, and there were several lovely silences but in the end someone would say something and we would turn it into a grand conversation!!!   Then Katie G. had to leave so we all decided to walk her home since Laura had been saying that she wanted to run around outside. So this was quite entertaining, and quite tragically none of Katie's neighbors were out, alas!! Well after Katie G. got to her house the rest of us decided to go to the park. When we got to the park, Laura decided that we should all go swinging, so we walked to the school. Haha, this was great fun indeed!!! So I swung with Katie and Nicholas for a while, but they decided to go off to the teeter-totter, so I hung out with everyone else. We had a great time talking about goodness knows what!! Well then we got hot, so we decided to go hang out in the shade. Laura decided that we should see if we could sneak away without Katie or Nicholas noticing, so whenever she said "trees" we would walk a little to the left. Well we didn't really get too far this way, so we decided to play some weird game with a basketball. Then Laura threw the ball quite obviously, and we all ran after it. Then we ended up running half way across the parking lot before Katie and Nicholas walked over to find us. So we waved at them and then ran away again and hid behind a building. We decided that they were taking too long to find us so Laura and I went and rolled down the hill, gotta relive the memories ya know!! Well we decided that it's much more fun to do in the dark so we only did that once!! Then we say them again and waved and then we ran away. Well we  thought  that they were following us, so we just ran along the path a little ways, and then Laura and Johanna were going to die, so we decided to walk the rest of the way.   So we decided that we'd make it like a video game or something, so we decided that Katie and Nicholas would be the "bad guys" and we named Nicholas "The Hurlinator" because he always wears a Hurley hat, and we named Katie "The Rockett" not too sure why we chose that one, but hey who cares!?!?! We figured that since we took the long way, they would take the short way and be home by the time we got there. Well when we got there, they weren't. So we just hung out for like 20 minutes waiting for them to get back!! In that time Katie's mum dished out the yummy cheesecake and when they got back, Katie was mad at her for that!!! Well they sort of got mad at us too. It turns out they walked around the school a couple times looking for us, and then decided that of course we'd walked down to the creek, because creeks hold such great amounts of fascination for us!! So finally they decided to come home, and lo and behold, there we were!!!  Then we just hung out for a while in Katie's room. We took some pictures, and Abby's camera started making noises like it was going to self destruct!! Yeah, it was great and I took several "momentos de kodak" so it's all good!!!!   It was soooo great to see Abby again, and I'm going to miss her when she goes home!!! We'll all just have to drive down to New Mexico to visit her!!!   So here are the lovely pics from our great adventure, and hopefully from looking at then you will figure out where the title came from:   urlLink    Awwww how cute, un momento de kodak!!!   urlLink    The momento de kodak  returns!!! But at a different angel!!   Well as you can see, the only decent pictures I took were of Katie and Nicholas, so sorry about that!! Oh well I think they're just great pictures and I get a kick out of them!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  Night Shift, Orangestick

      An owl and a chicken walk into a bar..... Well actually they didn't walk into a bar, the owl ran into a power line while carrying the chicken causing a forest fire!!! Does anyone else find that as hysterical as I do?!?!?! Honestly, you usually hear that the fire was caused by irresponsible campers, or by arson, but an owl and a chicken?!?! C'mon people, what kind of world do we live in where an owl can start a forest fire?!?! I think mother natures creatures are just getting either dumber and dumber, or smarter and smarter!!! You can look at it two ways: 1.) The owl was mad at loggers for cutting down it's home, so it decided to get back at them by catching the forest on fire so that the loggers would get no money for the trees. It's sort of like a martyr thing.  2.) The owl was just really dumb, and was so proud of itself for stealing the chicken from Farmer John that it didn't even see the large power line right in front of it.  So that's my philosophical thought for the day!! I'm going to bid you adieu now because Garrett just called!!! Wahoo!!!

I am petitioning my father to get HBO, so then we won't have to wait for it to come out every time!!! It's the same way with the Sopranos!! Patience is a virture, as I've posted earlier, but I just don't want to have patience is these matters!! Alas, it's finally out, so it's all good!!!   I'm not really sure what it is that draws me to that show, but man, oh man, it gets me every time!!!   Well I'm going to go call Katie now, because she'll kill me if I don't inform her of how my evening went!!!!   Au Revoir   Currently listeing to:  Alone, Sanctus Real

      Well I'm talking to Katie, and somehow we got onto the topic of chivalry and then we managed to find the topic of how they were going to throw away our trash for us. They being Nick and Garrett, as this entire thing happened on Wednesday when we went to the movie. We were both quite confused by this gallant gesture!! I mean we thought it was very cool, and quite nice, but we were both like, we're very capable of throwing away our own trash!! So I think we've determined that it's like carrying a girls books, and that it's a gesture to be praised, but to not take them up on!! So the gesture is much appreciated, and we're quite glad to see that chivalry and gallantry is not dying with the new generation!!!

      These are the most recognizable lines in the history of film!!! Well in the history of modern film. Oh alright in the history of films made in the past 5 years!! Okay so here it goes:   Morpheus : I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice. Tumbling down the rabbit hole?  Neo : You could say that.  Morpheus : I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?  Neo : No.  Morpheus : Why not?  Neo : 'Cause I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.  Morpheus : I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind -- driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?  Neo : The Matrix?  Morpheus : Do you want to know what it is?  (Neo nods his head.)   Morpheus : The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, or when go to church or when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.  Neo : What truth?  Morpheus : That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. (long pause, sighs) Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.  (In his left hand, Morpheus shows a blue pill.)   Morpheus : You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.  (a red pill is shown in his other hand)  You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.  (Long pause; Neo begins to reach for the red pill)  Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more.  (Neo takes the red pill and swallows it with a glass of water)    I was just surfing and I found that, I just thought it was the greatest thing!!! I mean if you read that you'd instantly know where it was from!! Those movies are just incredible in that way, they leave such a lasting impression!!   Well blogger seems to be  having some problems, so I'll bid you adieu!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  Always Something There to Remind Me, Naked Eyes

      Hahahaha, my life is filled with irony!!! Well some of you know of my most recent ironicness (thank you Garrett for helping me learn that -ness is the greatest suffix ever!!!) and irony has struck again!!! Yes my friends, again!!! So as you know from an earlier post, I had been looking for an original copy of the song "Money", and finally one day on a long and lonely bus ride to the Ape caves, I found it on one of Emily's CDs. Now I never found out who sung the song, I just immediately "borrowed" the CD and burned myself a copy of it. So just now I was putting the CD onto my computer and "Money" comes on, well my dad says, "This is Pink Floyd," And I'm like "No it's not, it can't be!!!" He's like "Yes it is, it's from Dark Side of the Moon." Now this was just unfathomable!!! I've had Dark Side of the Moon forever, and never listened to it all the way through!!! The song has been within my grasp for many a year and I've never found it!!!! And to add even more irony to this entire tale, I'm the one that burned Dark Side of the Moon for Emily in the first place, so I'm the only reason that she has that song!!!! Well I'm just about sick of irony for today, so this is me, signing off!!!   Au Revoir   Currently listening to:  Money, Pink Floyd!!!!

      Well some of you know how Katie and I have decided that when we're rich and famous we are going to build a town. This will be the greatest town, and it will be accordingly named, Stars Hollow. The entire town is going to be filled with places that are named after our inside jokes, so be sure to look it up when you're in the area!!! So anyways back to the reason I actually started this post. We took the long way home today and we found this really cool house, and I've decided that it will be the cool house that Katie and I will live in when we build our town. We've already decided that the house  must  be a Victorian house, and the library is going to be huuuuuuge, with really cool window seats!!!  Anyways here are the pictures:   urlLink    The cool Victorian house, but at a rather odd angle!   urlLink    Almost exactly like the latter picture, but not quite so tilted!!   urlLink    And from the other angle!!   Well I didn't quite get a good picture of the turret but it was better that than be run over by the cars coming behind us!!!

      Well the 4th was a grand time for me!!!!! It's the one day a year I get to let out the inner-pyro!!! It was soooo much fun!! We had an incredible amount of fireworks and the vast majority of them were illegal!!! So my uncle decided to be a genius and thought of the great idea to tape the fuses of the mortars together, so that you'd be able to get more to go at once. Wow, it was brilliant!!! We've decided that next year we should choreograph the music with the fireworks!!! So the boys that live near my grandpa came down, and they had a grand time with their fireworks. Then when it got cold we started the fire pit, and we made smores!!! Now I've got a great love of smores to begin with, so this was brilliant, but later one of the boys offered me a smore and I politely declined considering I'd already had several. Well my mum informed me later that I broke the poor guys heart!!! I feel terrible!!!! So all in all it was a great night! We had brilliant fireworks, and I got to let out the pyro within!!  Ooo, this is hysterical!!! So my mum was watching the news and they were doing this thing on Thomas Kinkade. Now I really dislike him because all of his art is the same, so I wasn't too sure if I wanted to watch this. But in the end it was just comical!!! There is this family that has so many Thomas Kinkade paintings that they have them on a rotation schedule so that all of them get hung up for a good amount of time!! That is simply madness!!! They spent over $100,000 on THOMAS KINKADE PAINTINGS!!!!!!!!! It's just crazy!! That guy shouldn't even be aloud to claim to be a painter!!! There is nothing unique about any of his paintings!! If you've seen one, you've seen them all!!!!  Oh, and then today my dad tried to lose my camera yet again!!! So everyone knows about how he lost it on spring break with all of our vacation pictures on it. Well he took it, without asking my permission I might add, to my grandpa's house this weekend. Several pictures were taken and it seems that someone left it on the deck!!! Well on the drive home, dad realized that he hadn't seen the camera!!! So we went back and got it. I was none to happy about this revelation, so I've come to the decision that no one can use my camera besides my friends, because they seem a tad more responsible than my parents!!!  Well now Katie had a grand time yesterday as well!!! She hung out with Nick's family and it sounded like she had a blast!!! One of Nick's sisters told her that she likes Katie better than Nick and that she'd like to have her as a sister!!! Katie and I both found that quite hysterical!!! So yes, I'll not bore everyone with the details, but let it be said Katie's hands were not cold the entire night!!!!!!!!!!  So I've pretty much run out of things to say, although I'm sure I'll think of something later, so for now this is goodbye!!!

      Haha, it appears that I am Miss Go To when it comes to fashion crisis!!! Poor Katie was freaking out today about what to wear tonight to the thing at the fort!!! I think we decided on the all American staple: Jeans, a patriotic flag T-shirt, and a sweatshirt!! Although now we're debating on whether or not she should wear the sweatshirt!! If she doesn't then she'll have the opportunity to say that she's cold, and then being the very chivalrous guy that he is, she'll get  his  sweatshirt!! I can't wait to hear about how the whole thing goes!!!  Well I'm not doing too much here!!! I finished Madam Bovary yesterday, and I'm halfway through another book!! I guess you could say that I've had a lot of spare time on my hands!!! Oh well I'll have even more spare time for the next couple of weeks, so I'll put a large dent in my personal library!!!  I'm quite interested to see whether the $300 we spent on fireworks will produce a good show or not!!! It should be interesting!! This is the only day every year that people can let out their inner pyro and not be considered crazy for it!!!!  Well I'm off to go do something, not sure what yet, but oh well!!

      Yes, yes I do know that patience is a virtue, and as some people know, I have an incredible amount of patience. But for some reason today, I just lost all of my patience!! We were out looking for fireworks, and my dad was being a tad "special" about the whole fireworks thing, and then he said "Move over" and for some reason, my infinite amount of patience was gone in an instant!! I asked my mum for the keys and sat in the car, listened to Thousand Foot Krutch, and read my book! Not quite sure where all my patience went but I'm really hoping that it's back soon!!!  Ooooo, we went to the German bakery yesterday, so I had liverwerst on a kaiser roll for lunch, and it was sooo good!!! I think that helped replenish some of my patience. Behold the wonders of liverwerst!! Not quite like the wonders of cheese, but close indeed!!  Well Garrett's in Tennessee now, so I'm hoping that he's having a grand time, and that he has enough batteries!!!  Oh, and Katie is going to hang out with Nick's family for the 4th of July!! I can't wait until Monday to hear about how it went!!! Katie gets to spend the day with his family, and then they're going to watch the fireworks thing at Fort Vancouver!!! I'm sure a grand time will be had by all!!  We've got all of our illegal fireworks, and we've been doing test runs for the past day or so. It's great to get the cool mortars that you can't get at the other places!! The people who live up the hill and their sons are coming down to watch, so I'm sure that everyone will just have a blast!!! No pun intended!!  I love that phrase, "No pun intended"!! Because every time someone says it, they're just trying to draw attention to the fact that they made a pun. So there's really no point in saying it at all!!! Quite often, I will say something, and then someone will say, "no pun intended," and I'll not even have realized that what I said could qualify as a pun!!  Well I'm trying to make up for my lack of human contact by socializing with the computer, but that's not working out too well for me, so I'll bid you all adieu!!

It is really one of the most recognizable sounds around. If you heard even part of it, you'd know exactly what it was!! It's like hearing "Somewhere over the Rainbow", you know exactly what song it is!! Unless you're Garrett, who hasn't seen the Wizard of Oz, but I'll soon change that!!  Well Garrett leaves tomorrow, which has me quite sad!!! Although I'm sure he'll have a grand time, so it'll all be good!!!  I got to see Harry Potter for the second time today!! My dad's been saddened by the fact that I've been going to see movies with my friends and not him, since he used to be my movie buddy!! Well he still is my movie buddy, but it would just be weird to take him to see a movie with Garrett, Katie, Nick, and I!!!! Oh well. I have to admit that the second time it is a bit dull!! And then after a while it becomes interminable, and  you begin looking at your watch to see how much longer it could possibly last, only to find that it's only been several minutes, and Harry Potter is still trying to save the day!!!! Alas, it was still good, so all is well!!  Right then, well I'm quite out of things to say!! So I'm going to see if I can get somebody to answer the question about when dinner's going to be!!!

      Well I'm sorry about not posting about hanging out with Abby last night, I was running really short on time, and I had much better ways to spend my time online than posting, and I'm quite sure that some people will know what that means if you think really hard about it!!!  So when I got to Katie's house she was on line, of course!!! So I talked to Garrett for a while which was a tad strange with Katie sitting right there next to me!! Then I left momentarily and Garrett and Katie talked about something, and neither of them will tell me what!!!! So again we continued talking and then Abby got there!!! Katie and I made some of the most interesting noises trying to log off the computer and answer the door all at the same time, and let me tell you, that didn't work very well!!!  We all went up to Katie's room and hung out and talked for hours!!! Abby told us all about her boyfriend, and it sounds like he's cool. Katie and I decided that we'd have to fly down there to meet him first, before we'd give him our stamp of approval!!! So I honestly can't disclose half of what we talked about, but hey it was soooooo much fun!!!   Katie's mum picked yummy fresh raspberries, and Abby and I found out that Katie doesn't like eating anything that's been grown outside!!! Which really limits her choices!! She was terrified to eat a raspberry because she thought that she would eat a bug. She then proceeded to tell Abby and I that we would soon have bugs living inside of us!! What a comforting thought that was!!!  Oh, Garrett, I hope that you managed to fit everything into one bag, for your sake!!!! Say hello to the irritating one for me!!!

      Yes, yes, yes, I kow I've posted twice already today, but this is soooo worthy of posting!! I just found out that the Pixies are going to be at Bumbershoot this year!!!!! I'm sooooo freaking out, that's going to be a killer show!!! I mean Bumbershoot is awesome anyways, and it's just sooo much fun, there's nothing like an arts and music festival to kick off the school year. It's right before school starts, so I get to have fun and hang out the day before school starts, since the Pixies are playing on the 6th and school starts the 7th!!! On top of the Pixies playing, my mum read in the Lively Times that The Killers might be there, I would totally throw a fit if that turns out to be true, I absolutely love The Killers they're sooooo good!!!! There's nothing like some good 80's revival to brighten up your day!!! Then even more good news!!! Sara's coming with me this year!!! That will make the entire thing even more fun!!! Not that hanging out with my dad and his crazy friends from Montana isn't fun......  Also, The Killers and Dashboard are going to be on Pepsi Smash tonight!! Considering they have shown Phantom Planet, Switchfoot, and now The Killers, this is quickly becoming one of my favourite shows!!!!  Well I think that's all until after I got hang out with Abby!!!

      My day today started off quite well actually. Although I didn't really sleep at all last night, and I'm not too sure why! So I was brushing my teeth this morning and the radio started playing "Meant to Live" by Switchfoot!!! This was a complete miracle! I don't listen to air1 which is the station that plays that type of music, so I was totally surprised!! So that totally started my day off great!!  Then I was sitting here, reading Madam Bovary and listening to "More Than Fine, by Switchfoot, and I realized that I am sooooo much more than fine!! Now I'm a happy person by nature but I have been even happier lately, as many people who have been around me know!!!   Well that's all for now!!

      There was a great line in a song from Rent that I was going to post and for the life of me I can't remember it!! It had something to do with how you shouldn't live with regret because it'll prevent you from living completely. I just thought that was really awesome!  Well the play was awesome!!! I can certainly see why it is considered the play that will represent the 90s. Those people are amazing!!! I wish I had a shred of the talent they did. It's just incredible what they do. I find it so cool how through song they can express everything. I think that all of the actors could just sit there and sing and the play would have nearly as much impact as it does with them acting as well as singing!!  The play itself was ummm, I think I need a thesaurus!! Anyways it was the greatest thing!! I'll not even try to describe it as I will do it an incredible injustice. I think it helped break through some barriers though, that's for sure!!   I'm going to post some pictures as soon as I upload them, so hang tight and soon, oh so soon, they will be here.

      Oh you know it!!! Every one of these quotes came from out most interesting evening!!! I was being me, and I forgot my camera so ya'll will have to check out Mandy's blog for the pictures. But surprisingly enough I was put in charge of posting all of the most brilliant quotes. So for all interested in a good laugh here ye go:   "Hey, give me the runts woman!" -Mandy  "I don't want you touching my leg again!" -Sara  "There's wood in my soup." -Laura "It's not wood it's meat." - Mandy "It's not meat it's ginger root!." -Heather  "You have a boyfriend?!?!?!" -Hannah  "We're being Bruce Willis from Diehard." -Hannah  "I was gonna say 'Why're you throwing eggs at me' but they're not eggs." -Laura  "Mandy... It leaks." -Heather  " In our bathtub??? " -Laura  "Laura there's water on your floor. Laura there's water on your rug now too." -Hannah "Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!" -Laura  "Don't flex your butt again." -Karsen  "Heather, you spelled die wrong, there's an 'i'." -Sara  "I didn't flex my butt!!!" -Sara  "You ready to beat me at this?" -Sara "Am I ever!" -Laura "You'll beat me at it next time." -Sara  "My foot is like flinching!" -Heather  "Oh my goodness I'm dying." -Laura  "There's something mysterious on my pad." -Hannah (in reference to her Dance Dance Revolution pad)  "This one had dirty lyrics." -Hannah "I know but it's easy." -Laura  "I wanna do this one cuz she goes 'shiny disco balls.'" -Sara  "It's the Samba dude." -Sara  "What's your real name?" -Hannah "Heather." -self explanatory "Ohhhh yeah..." -Hannah (at 11p.m. so we'd already spent over 6 hours together)  "Someone take the starbursts away from that woman." -Mandy "But they bounce!" -Hannah  "This from the girl with the starburst wrapper stuck to her face." -Heather  "I'm Miss America!!!!" -Hannah (with the starburst wrappers  still  on her face)  "Yeah! The song with the dirty lyrics!!!" -Mandy  "Let's put stuff on our faces and see if it sticks!" -Hannah  "It's saxy!!!" -Mandy  "That was when I weighed 700lbs." -Sara  "Cuz she would know that he would know who she is." -Sara (in reference to the movie Vertigo)  "So she broke a couple of legs." -Heather (in reference to whether the lady in Vertigo was really dead after she plummeted off of a bell tower)  "She's gonna die!!" -Heather "What a pessimist." -Hannah "I'm not a pessimist, that was just wishful thinking." -Heather  "Wait, she's dead?" -Hannah Warman (laura's sister)  "Silly little girl." -Sara "Hitchcock isn't for kids." -Heather  "You know, I don't want you at  my  funeral." -Hannah  "Oh that's my wax." -Hannah W.   "Ahhhh, I'm so scared!!" -Hannah "It's just a nun." -Heather  "Do you remember when you were dead?" -Laura  "After getting one off the ground that's enough." -Laura  "Straight people don't need straighteners." -Heather   Yes we really did write all of these down!!! I'm sure that we've forgotten to write many of them down, but oh well!!! So I'm sorry for any mistakes but it's a lot to type and hey I'm lazy. Well I'll do a detailed post about everything that we did later since I'm going to call Katie!!

      Mmmm, sorry I didn't post yesterday I just wasn't really feeling like it! Hmmm, I think that's a first for me!! I don't know, I was soooo tired yesterday it was crazy!!  Oh I got the house  all  to myself yesterday evening!! That was awesome!! I really like being home alone it's just cool. There's just something about being there with no one else and just doing whatever, it's nice. I could make myself dinner when I wanted and I know this sounds dumb, but it was just really nice!!  Oooo, this is awesome we have HBO for the weekend (I know that sounds really funny) so I watched White Oleander, Unfaithful, and an episode from the new season of Six Feet Under!! That was sooo confusing, some people weren't together, other people were married, and someone had a kid!! Hahaha, it was really cool though!!  Well today Sara came over and we watched movies and hung out, that was a good time!! We watched the Perfect Score, which was actually not bad!! I mean it wasn't great or anything, but not bad! We ate the rest of my princess fruit snacks too!! Twas quite an entertaining time!!  I'm sooooo excited for tomorrow!!! We're going to have an incredible amount of fun!! It's unbelievable. I'll totally bring my camera so that everyone will get to see!!   Well I'm going to go order some take-out Thai so...

       Yes I think I did sing that today, or at least hummed it!!!      So Garrett, Katie, Emily, and I were all going to go to the fair today, which would have been a  total  blast!!! Actually I'll begin at last night, so that everything can be nice and chronological!      Katie spent the night, and when she got here I'd actually been talking to Nick's cousin, which was a tad weird to say the least!! We watched 10 Things I Hate About You and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights. Hahaha, Dirty Dancing was funny, or at least I thought so. Oh, and we hate soooo many princess shaped fruit snacks!!! Hahaha, that was great!! I think we stayed up until 3 just talking about nothing too much!! That's how it always is when she spends the night!! Well we woke up at 8 to the wonderful sound of rain!!! I'd heard on the news that it was supposed to stop before noon. Well Garrett called at 8:30 to see if we still were going to do anything, since he'd heard that it was to rain all day. So we came up with the grand plan of just renting movies and hanging out at my house!! I got to call Emily then, and of course I woke her up, oops!!       So everyone got to my house a tad after 10. Haha, when Garrett rang the door, Katie and Emily wouldn't let me out of my room!!! I was being held prisoner in my own bedroom!! So we hung out on my stairs while we were waiting for my mum to finish whatever she was doing, and then we strolled on over to Hollywood. We got some grand movies!! First of all we spent a good half hour there, which was actually impressive as far as I'm concerned since I could spend allll day there!! So in the end we ended up renting: Matchstick Men, The Wizard of Oz, Sixth Sense, and Secret Window. The only one of those movies that I hadn't seen was Matchstick Men, and it was actually pretty good!! And of course Wizard of Oz is just a classic, although I think that after a while it does start to drag on!! But Garrett got to see it for the first time, which was great!!! Haha, I hope the singing didn't make you too tired!! Quite impressively enough Garrett actually guessed the end of Sixth Sense too which was very cool indeed!! That is a grand movie, not scary but still good!!       Oh and I can't forget about the pixie sticks!! Haha, Garrett brought pixie sticks, and we ate the entire bag!! They're sooo good though, the blue is my absolute favorite!! Oh and Garrett thank you very much for letting me have the last blue!! Chivalry is not dead!!      So I think I'm running out of things to say, although I'm sure that I'll be back later to post something that I completely forgot!!

       That doesn't have the books I want!!!   They didn't have the 2 books that I was looking for!!! So instead of buying the next two books in the series, I got the last book and the middle book!! Oh well. Oh this is great, they actually bought most of my books!!! I got a $55 in-store credit!!!! Wahoooo, even though I know that I will use it incredibly fast, but hey oh well!!     So we went to pick Garrett up from his PSAT class today, and impressively enough we found it with no incidents!! Although my mother was illegally parked but that's okay. Anyways, I went to find him, and I managed to be just around the corner from where he was!! It was hysterical. I did get several chapters in Tolstoy read though! Then we wandered on over to Powells, with my mother muttering under her breath, "I hate Portland!" the entire time!! We found a great Thai place to have lunch, and it was awesome!!! I did not know that Garrett likes Thai, but I am quite quite glad that he does!! It's quite hard to find people who like foreign food these days!! Then we went to Powells, which was good, as I could live there and be happy!! Amazingly Garrett had never been there before!! It's one of the greatest places ever!!! Hahaha. Then since it's right across from Powells, we waltzed on into Ozone UK which is my faaaavorite music store!! They didn't have the Dandy Warholls CD that I was looking for, but I did get the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band though! Haha, thanks Emily for introducing me to that lovely CD!!   I felt bad for Garrett though because he didn't know any of the bands, after all they are all Indie bands anyways. No I take that back, he knew AC/DC!! That's a good start by the way!! I then took him to meet my lovely horse. And Skittles mauled him like she does  everyone  else!! Thankfully Lauren wasn't there, so no introductions had to be made!!!       Well Katie's coming over tonight, so I think that I'm going to go eat some dinner so that when she gets here we can watch out great chick flicks and eat princess shaped fruit snacks!! Haha yes that is an ISJ!!       Au Revoir         Currently listening to:    When I'm Sixty-Four, The Beatles

      Wow, I have crazier friends than even I knew. Here's a conversation with Brittany and I that I just thought I should share with all of you:   BertnyB:  lol, don't you have any at your house?  ScaramouchQueen:  i don't think so!!  ScaramouchQueen:  which is total madness!!  BertnyB:  sad...a house without ice cream  ScaramouchQueen:  yeah no kidding!!  BertnyB:  it must be a lonely freezer  ScaramouchQueen:  ya know, i think i'll go talk to it just to make sure it feels loved  BertnyB:  good idea  ScaramouchQueen:  mmmm, it says it's lonely but if i move the dryer over there it'll be doing good  BertnyB:  we don't want any sad kitchen appliances at the early household  ScaramouchQueen:  hmm ironic, the freezer has a crush on the dryer  ScaramouchQueen:  no we don't!!  ScaramouchQueen:  that would not be good, they might start attacking!!  BertnyB:  wow, that is ironic  BertnyB:  i know!!  ScaramouchQueen:  only in my house would that happen too!!  BertnyB:  lol  ScaramouchQueen:  i swear my socks party while i'm gone!!  BertnyB:  LOL  ScaramouchQueen:  i find them all over the place!!!  BertnyB:  they must party with the appliances  ScaramouchQueen:  i bet so!!  ScaramouchQueen:  it's just one big party at my house all the time!  BertnyB:  no wonder there's no ice cream!  BertnyB:  the partiers ate it all!  ScaramouchQueen:  haha, well ice cream is a party essential!  ScaramouchQueen:  and those socks need to make sure they're well fed!  BertnyB:  exactly!  ScaramouchQueen:  if not they'll run out of steam halfway through the party and they'll have to cut short their hot date with the shirts!  I just thought that ya'll would find that entertaining, if not, oh well, your sense of humor is just much less twisted than mine!!

      Hahaha I found this website a while ago and thought it was hysterical, but I forogt to write the address down. Well I just found it today while surfing!!! I'm soo happy. Anyways, I found this on it, I think it's quite hysterical:    1. Use a husky, dirty voice but ask normal questions about the proposed offer.“Is it a low interest rate? mmmmm…I like low interest rates…really low…”  2. In an outrageously excited tone: “Thank god you called!!!” Explain that an online psychic told you that your future lover would randomly call disguised as an asshole.  3. Say you are hard of hearing and see how loud they will shout into the phone.  4. Allow the telemarketer to fully explain his offer. When he is finished explain that his company hired you to randomly spot check telemarketers on their performance. Tell him that he did a good job overall, but that he is a bit monotone and needs to fluctuate his tone of voice more to sound convincing. He also should pause longer between sentences, and more clearly pronounce the letter “s”. Tell him you won’t report him if he repeats his speech to you with the appropriate corrections. Repeat.  5. Be incredibly polite as they explain their offer, but make farting noises once in a while and ask whether there is something wrong with the connection.  6. In an annoyed tone cut the telemarketer off mid sentence : “Dan, stop screwing around…we have to get rid of this body fast, did you find a chainsaw or not?”  7. “Congratulations! You’re the 100th caller on the (insert local radio station) Sweet Vacation Giveaway Blast Marathon. You’ve just won a pair of tickets to Negril, Jamaica and the use of Sean Paul’s celebrity vacation house.” Take down her address and send her all of your L.L.Bean catalogues for the rest of your life...after you use them as liner for your cat’s litter box.  8. Flirt.  9. Keep repeating, “I knew you were going to say that…”  10. Stutter on a syllable of an obvious word in a sentence… see how long it takes before he completes the phrase. When he does, get upset, and say “That really hurts my fee…fee… fee… fee…feel…fee… fee… fee…” ad infinitum.  11. Pee on the phone while he’s talking.  12. Mid pitch, stop him and complement him on his wonderful voice. Explain that you are a voiceover scout and might have a breakthrough commercial job for him. Ask if he wouldn’t mind doing a quick test. Ask him to say in a deep husky voice “May cause dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting and shortness of breath. A small number of participants in a recent clinical trial experienced weight loss, irregular clotting, abnormally frequent and/or painful urination and hair loss. Results may vary”  13. Ask how much it would take to get him to stop working as a telemarketer. Start at $1000. Say you are dead serious.  14. Ask if he will be your friend if you sign up.  15. Tie obscure facts about Barbara Streisand to everything thing he says,, “2.3% interest rate? oh my…did you know Barbara was 23 when she filmed Funny Girl…”  16. Every few minutes repeat, “You’re going to have to bear with me, I have a slight short term memory loss problem…who is this again?”  17. “Oh my god, I used to have your job…does Bob still work there (repeat names until you find a match)…which building are you in?” Escalate coincidence until you both realize that you sat in the same chair. Explain that you had to quit work when your genitals mysteriously vanished.  18. Regardless of the offer tell him you’ll take 7. If he asks what you mean say he drives a hard bargain and you’ll take 9, but that’s as far as you’ll go.  19. Every half-minute ask him to hold and pretend to scream at your invalid mother. “You want to use the bathroom??? Well stop whining and get up out of the wheelchair for a change. You just sit there and think about that for a while, mother. Can’t you see I’m on the damn phone?”  20. Forgive him. Tell him you did. Over and over again, until he hangs up. Then secretly take it back.    Oh and please forgive the color, I'm sort of in a colorful mood today!!!   Au Revoir     Currently listening to: Ammunition, Switchfoot

       This is great!! I was watching Good Morning America this morning and they did this thing about what some of the 100 most dangerous things in everyday life are, and it was hysterical!!! Okay so here goes:   Teddy bears  (I heard the word teddy bear which is the only reason I watched it to begin with)   are more dangerous than grizzly bears. There are 140,000 toy related injuries each year!!!       Q-Tips are more dangerous than razor blades!! Although if anyone has seen the SNL where there is a giant Q-Tip then I think that is easy to believe!!      TV sets cause 42,071 injures each year. This includes people walking into them causing them to fall over, and people being poked in the eye with an antenna!!      What does that tell you about the stupidity of people?!?!? Really have any of  you  hurt yourselves with a Q-Tip??? Alas, humanity is just going down hill, maybe when I'm president I can change that!!    Hahaha, this is random, Matt Byerly IMd me today. I haven't talked to him in like a month, and before that I'd never talked to him!! It was strange!!!  Oh, hopefully Katie will be spending the weekend with me!!! That would be awesome!! Hahaha, we'd have suuuuuch a fun time oh my gosh!!!! Hmmmmm, I'm thinking of the number of inside jokes that could come out of this, and I feel bad for Nick and Garrett!!!

       This is ridiculous!!! So Emily just called me about going to the Dave Mathews Band concert, and I swear I walked to the family room to ask my dad if he could take us, and I'm like, 'Oh wait, haha I can't go, we're going to be at Bumbershoot!!' How ridiculous is that?!?! I mean I typed the dates earlier, and I didn't even think about it!!! My goodness, goldfish is really beginning to have new meaning now!!!      Oh I'm going to Powells on Thursday!!! I'm quite excited about that, and not just because that place is like my second home well my third home, since Katie's house is my second home. Anyways. Yeah, Garrett's coming along, so that should be entertaining!!! Only Katie has seen me when I'm book shopping, and let me tell you, that is an entertaining thing to watch!!! I'm getting a couple of books for school, and oh my goodness, they're long!! Okay so they're not that long, but the farther in the series I get the longer they get!! Who knew that The Three Musketeers was the beginning of a 6 book series?!?! Not me, and of course once I start it I have to finish it!!       I'm going to continue my conversation with Nick, and hope that Garrett comes back!! Otherwise this will prove to be a dull evening indeed!!       Au Revoir       Currently listening to:    Sgt.

      Man, o man, do ever love that movie!! The Princess Bride, just in case you were wondering, although if you didn't know that, I'm quite stunned, and believe that you need to immediately go and watch it!!!  So this is just amazing. I'm trying to sell my mac. Thank you Garrett for finally giving me a reason to!! Anyways, I've been looking for the past 3 hours for somewhere besides ebay to sell it, and I've only come up with two places. And I still don't even know if they'll buy it from me, because I need to email them for an estimate!! Honestly I don't know why someone wouldn't want a 2 year old iMac!!Mmmm, okey yeah I do but still!! There has to be someone out there who's so smitten with the looks of the iMac, that they want to buy it. So if you're that person them  PLEASE  do email me about it!!!   And if you mention this ad you'll get 5% off your next purchase.       Speaking of macs. I was telling my friend today that I wanted to sell mine, and she says, "Are you getting a new computer?" I said, "Yeah my boyfriend is going to make me one." After a pause she goes, "It's not a mac is it, those are confusing." Hahahaha, I just couldn't believe that!!! I mean c'mon macs are soooooo not confusing at all!!!! That makes me laugh soooo darn hard!!  Anyways, I'm off to email people about whether they want to purchase my lovely mac from me, oh please buy it please buy it!!!
