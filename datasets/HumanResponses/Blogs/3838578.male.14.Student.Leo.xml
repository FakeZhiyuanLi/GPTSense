       Dear Dairy,    Well things have been going good. I apologize for not checking in recently, I have been doing all sorts of things. I guess I will start where I left off.    As I had been saying, my birthday has come and gone. I have been gone from this blog recently due to a game I got for my birthday. I have probably been playing this game too much, but meh, it isn't like I have anything else to do.    Inspiration has struck and I feel like drawing something, I'll get to that in a bit.    My uncle is in town, he took me to get soccer kletes, we went for a bike ride and other fun stuff.    We are contemplating going to Black Hills (sounds like a place out of LOTR)    I'm sorry, inspiration is killing me. I must go    Hakuna Matata,  Anita

       Dear Dairy,     &nbsp;   Again I apologize for the lack of quality posts, but who  doesn't  love Lil Friz, the poems I can understand. But come on, he is wearing a clock. A CLOCK.     &nbsp;   Anyway, last night I suffered uncontrollable rage. For once in my life, it wasn't about soccer&nbsp;(I actually missed practice). It was about the story I write. I mean I write this story as much as I can, but there are certain individuals that just don't understand the work that is put into writing a chapter of my story. First I have to plan it, write it, edit it, send it to editor, publish it. It isn't exactly the easiest thing in the world to do. So it doesn't make my life easier when people say "Oh, when are you going to write more," "You haven't updated in a week! Gosh!". Well I have had enough of this. Honestly, do these people not think that I have a life. I try my best, but I would rather talk to my friends that I have not seen in weeks that write some story. So if you feel you just can't wait, well too bad.     &nbsp;   It got to the point last night where I hated my own story, thanks to people for helping me cure rage (you know who you are).     &nbsp;   I would just like to say that I am over this rage and have no hard feelings, so if you feel you are one of these people, don't worry about it ;)     &nbsp;   In other news, my birthday is in four days! I can't wait! It is going to be exciting!!!!     &nbsp;   Talk to you later and expect new lil friz pictures soon!     &nbsp;   Hakuna Matata    Anita

        The New Pair Of Shoes   &nbsp;  I bought a new pair shoes  They’re so fast, a race. I can’t lose!  &nbsp;  They sparkle bright in the sun.  To just have them is so much fun.  &nbsp;  I run and run, fast as I can.  When I stop, People tell me how fast I ran.  &nbsp;  I ran in the marathon with these new pair of shoes.  I came in first; I was front page of the news!  &nbsp;  So as summer came, soon it was gone.  The shoes, they left footprints as marks on the lawn.  &nbsp;  Autumn arrived a down the leaves fell.  Winter then came at the sound of a bell.  &nbsp;  Winter boots were the footwear that I now wore.  My nice not-so new shoes were behind the door.  &nbsp;  So winter passed as the snow up and melted.  No more snowballs would I now be pelted.  &nbsp;  For spring I couldn’t wait, to open that door.  And get those old shoes that I did adore.  &nbsp;  I tried and I tried to fit them on.  I would have to hand them down to my little bro John.  &nbsp;  So deeply I was saddened as I passed down my shoe,  But I didn’t worry, because I got more shoes, brand new.  &nbsp;  And I smiled and smiled, filled with glee.  These new shoes the fit perfectly.  &nbsp;  I then realized that this was a cycle,  As John passed down my shoes to baby boy Michael.&nbsp;

      Dear Dairy,  Well, it is raining here. Nothing much has been going on lately, I have been visiting with teh neighbours since they are going back out to the lake soon.  My birthday is in a few weeks, I don't want much, just some hardware things, a game. I want to get Tales Of Symphonia for the gamecube. It came out yesterday and I want it so badly, but alas, I must wait. >_  Things are doing fine here, soccer every sunday could be better, but I'm not complaining.  Hakuna Matata, Anita.

      Dear Dairy,  Sorry about the title, I really had no idea what to put, and to be honest I didn't want to put Bored....again....again as the title.  I'm also sorry about all the poetic-ness going around here. I don't know why, I just felt like rhyming things with things. If you are wondering if I based "I wish I had said goodbye" off of something in my life, the anwser is no and it is  meant  to be dark and sad. I did it intentionally.  Soccer is looking up as we won the last game of the first half. I'm really glad we ended on the right foot. I may just drop by some practices if they aren't "Military-ish".  Well, Since the neighbours went to the lake, I found myself doing a lot of writing (not that I haven't been recieving pressure from peers, You know who you are!). I haven't just been writing, but enjoying myself.   Hakuna Matata! Anita

       I Wish I Had Said Goodbye   I wish I had said goodbye If I had, I wouldn’t cry  For now I miss you so From your smile to your left toe  Why did I not say goodbye? Why did I not say so long? I remember the days of Pong, and good old Donkey Kong  Now you are gone from here Never to see you, is what I fear  I will never forget who you are Because we have come so far  Together forever that’s what we said You left me, you practically fled  Now I am all alone I try to call you on the phone  I never get through to talk I wish we could go on one last walk  Now as I write this I see You peering through the window at me  You came back to see me one last time I guess I was worth your dime  I really missed you its no lie Because I wish I had said goodbye

      This is a poem I wrote in my free time.   A Clown Named Bob   There once was a clown, Bubbles his name. To make children laugh, that was his game.  One day, that Bubbles, he went to the fair. With only one sock, who believes in a pair?  He stuck out in the crowd, like a sore thumb. People called him bad names. They called him a bum.  Bubbles didn’t get discouraged; he held his head high. It was then his face that got hit by a pie.  He was pointed at, laughed at as he began to sob. When who came over, but a clown named Bob.  “Don’t be discouraged” Bob said with great glee. “We’re supposed to be funny,” just look at me.  So Bob stood up with a smile on his face. And fell to the ground as he tripped on his lace.  Bubbles then realized he had nothing to fear. For his job as a clown, was to share lots of cheer.  So as Bubbles got up and he told a great joke. As Bob fell once again, he slipped on an egg yolk.  So later that night, Bubbles was leaving the fair. He won another sock, he believed in that pair.  During that day he had made a new friend. He and Bob, they’d be clowns till the end.  But most importantly, he had learned a great rule. That when the people laugh, they don’t think you’re a fool.  They laugh and they laugh, full of great cheer. They laugh and they laugh because you filled them with jeer.   So as Bubbles went out in public, he stuck out like a thumb. But people applauded, they loved him, the silly old bum.  He wasn’t hated, not even a bit He even received a fruit-filled basket.  He jumped and he jumped, he loved his job. It was all thanks to a clown named Bob.

      Dear Dairy,  Well, I just got back from soccer in the rain. We lost, but I'm not worried. I am currently working on a new matrix comic, the characters can be found here: (Copy and Paste)http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v325/Totey/Mat.bmp  But let's rewind to yesterday, shall we?  Nothing much went on yesterday, except for the best soccer game of our season. We passed great, shot great, ran great, and won! I was so happy that we won. Obviously however, it didn't restore any faith in our team. But that doesn't matter.  We went out for supper to my Grandma's, where my aunt from Toronto made supper. I thought I wouldn't be hungry since I had just gotten my braces adjusted. But I guess I ate a lot for not being hungry.   I made two new comics and put them up on my website. I also posted some stuff on my forums and wrote another part of my story. Both which can be found at www.geocities.com/looseends26  My brother has been having his friend over every day this week. I am frankly getting sick of him coming over and taking over my room. One of these times I just might accidentally drop a knife or something. Of course I'm kidding. If you though I was serious than I pity you.  I also got my hair cut, it doesn't look sooo bad, but at least it's not layers. It'll grow back, it always does.  I am waiting for Michaela to get back from her lake on Saturday so that we can do a huge Loose Ends overhaul.  Well, See ya next time and Hakuna Matata!  Anita

      Well, let's start from where I left off...  As I arrived at the soccer field, expecting the worst. Things finally started looking up. We were short players (only 10 showed up) until I saw two kids from the younger age group that we had brought up to play with us. This was the first game since the beginning of the season in which we had a sub! I was so happy. We played a good first half, only down 1-0. But at half one of our players were kicked out of the game by the coach for talking back, we were back to square one. We ended up losing... but it wasn't  that  bad. but today I am not here to rant about soccer (as you know I can do perfectly well) so let's talk about some other things.  Right now I am listening to music. I like Disney Music a lot. It is very fun to listen to, especially for me because it reminds me both of my childhood, and my trip to Disney World.  I also like Evanescence. They are much darker, and somewhat suicidal >_>. But I like them nonetheless, their music is easier to relate to then "I know that your toxic!".   Well I have to go... tata for now and Hakuna Matata!  Anita.

      Yeah, so I went to yesterday's soccer practice, as planned. It turned out to be worse than a military camp. Instead of just having our coach run the practice like he should. We have parents invade. I don't want to name names so let's call the parents Snit1 and Snit2.  So we start out on a small field with no nets, we are warming up with the balls, like our coach always tells us to. Snit1 comes over and gets us doing all of these weird stretches. After that we move to a bigger field, normally this would be a good thing, but not this practice.  You see, we don't always have the best turnout at practices, at this practice there were 5 people, 5 flippin people! What the heck are five people supposed to do on a whole field. Normally it would be no big, but we kicked off a team of 15 to use it. I really don't get our team sometimes.  Then we started a drill, it started out good, but after doing it for forty minutes and only five people, I naturally needed some water, so I went over to the goal posts to get my water bottle, when Snit2 yelled from the sidelines "You shouldn't need water! Why are you getting water?" I naturally wanted to punch Snit2 in the face. But alas, I continued on the practice.   After this drill we did one more followed by a "world cup" drill where we didn't get a break till we were done. By this time I was already feeling sick and not getting a break.   After practice was over, I sat in the car with a plastic bag in my lap because I was so sick from not getting a break. We ran for 1 hour and 30 minutes STRAIGHT!  Now this might not seem as bad as it was but imagine this. Everytime you make a bad kick, lectured. Everytime you miss the goal, humiliated. There was constant pressure from both Snit1 and Snit2. It got to the point where Snit1 came over and TIED MY FLIPPIN SHOE for me! What is this coming to you ask. Well I am just wondering why they couldn't of just left us alone in the first place. We are losing, yes. But do we care in the least, no. We just want to have fun, and now that is impossible. Those two do not belong there and I wish they would just leave us alone. They put way too much tension and pressure on both the team and me as an individual, now I am considering abandoning practices altogether. Heck, I almost cracked a few times on the field.  I hope you now understand what I meant when I said that there was "corruption within the higher ranks of the team"  Anita

      Expect a lot of posts like this one, I get bored a lot. But I really don't see why. I have so much that I could do, comics, movies, video games.  Mom and Dad had a big TV in there room, but they decided that they wanted a smaller one to fit in their cabinet, so I have the HUGE tv in my room. (Well maybe it isn't exactly huge. I am currently browsing the channels and the best thing on is Rescue Heroes. I hate sundays.  Another reason I hate sundays is because of soccer. Don't get me wrong, I love soccer. It's just the team. There is so much corruption within the higher ranks of our team, not to mention yappy sideline parents. We have won one game, tied one game and lost about a zillion games. We have a practice every sunday at 7:00, I hate that so much, but it doesn't make me angry.  While we were cleaning the basement yesterday, I stumbled upon some books that I may take great interest it. 1,001 Logical Laws, Accurate Aximos, Profound Principals etc, and 10,000 Dreams interpteted. I shall lend it to Michaela to help her with her dreams section on my site. If for some reason you don't know what my site is, it is in my profile.  Well, after saving all the people. The rescue heroes saved a birds nest from a tree and there is this brat whining that her doll house is gone. I hate her too. I have found that this blog is a good place to let out emotions.   OKAY! This "Rescue Hero" told me that is someone dropped as cigerette butt on the ground to say "Hey! The world isn't your ash tray." He is such a loser.  What's on next on the boob tube you ask? A cartoon about a cockroach - robot hybrid. Oh and he talks. Should be great. Too bad I am changing the channel.  Anyway, I could rant about TV all day. But that would be boring wouldn't it? Maybe I'll make a section called "Tv Rants". Oh gosh, see what happens to me when I am bored.  On thursday I went to Spider-Man 2 with Ingrid, Cori, Vedran, Sean A, and Brittney. It was a good movie, but buckle your seats as I am about to start talking in nerd.  It was a very good movie and these are my possible theories for the next one  **Spoilers if you haven't seen it yet**  We KNOW that the Harry-Green Goblin will be in SM3 but here are some other options.  Venom should be in the next movie because MJ was seen dating Jameson's son, who is an astronaut preparing to go to space. The symbiote (which formed Venom) is found on the moon. The symbiote travels back to earth through Jameson and the symbiote rock finds its way to Peter. Peter becomes Venom until he visits good ol Doc Conners, who removes the symbiote from Peter. Peters school-mate, Eddie Brock is then infected with the symbiote and becomes Venom for good. This is when he would team up with Goblin and fight Spidey.  Hob-Goblin - The hob-goblin was often seen fighting with green goblin. To refresh your memory, the Hob-Goblin was the purple and orange one that threw pumpkin bombs.  If they really wanted to, now that MJ knows about Peter being SM, the director could make her Spider-Woman, but I doubt that it is early enough, or a wise decision to do that.  I would really like to have the cartoon Sinister Six in one of these movies the sinister six, led by Kingpin and that guy in the wheelchair were: Doc Ock, Scorpion, Shocker, Rhino, Chameleon, and Mysterio. I like Mysterio and Chameleon, they were always the coolest.  Speaking of Mysterio, my brother rented the Spider-Man 2 game and Mysterio is a boss. He looks so cool and sounds awesome, I hope that is how he is portayed in the movies.  Overall that game is really fun with all places in real New York and it strays from the SM2 plot by adding waaaaaaay more action!  Anyway, that is it for my Spider-Man talk [/nerd]  I have gotten to the point where I can't think of anything else to write, I will most definately be bored tommorow so I will write.
