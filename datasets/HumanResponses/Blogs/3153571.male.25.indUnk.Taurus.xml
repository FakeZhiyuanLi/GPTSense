						    A note for all Indian Voters- Did u Know this?    ”One important information with regard to voting is the usage of Article 40. I don't think many (even the so-called educated) people know about this article. I came to know this when I was watching a election talk in TV yesterday. The article says that if a voter is not willing to cast his/her vote for any of the candidates contesting the election, then they may record their "votes" in this category. There will be a special booklet to record such scenarios. This booklet needs to be maintained at every election counter! (even some of the Election officers themselves are unaware of this article and so don't be surprised if you hear any negative response from them w.r.t this). How will this help? If the number of such recorded votes exceeds the number of votes obtained by the "winning" candidate, then the candidate's election can be disqualified and a re-election can also happen (with fresh candidates this time around!!). This article "Exist" from 1961 and hasn't been used till date. A better election awareness campaign is a MUST I suppose. “   The above has been taken from the Infosys Notice Board.

						    May 06 2004 - Mani -The yogi  ------------------------------------------------------ Another uneventful day at office. Except for one instance when my AM came upto me and tried to reassure me that I should not lose faith in infosys. Well...faith. I am here for the money dude. I tried to play the Mr.DecentGuy, saying that," Listen, I am not trying to use this as a bargaining platform for better opportunities within infy". I hoped he noticed the hallow around my head. But as expected I am sure he didnt.  Went home early and thought about getting a movie to watch.But as I was walking to the store I got into a reflective mode. I thought" Well, I am happy today cos I had no work. Let me go and get some exercise". So I turned back and went home. After huffing and puffing though a few pushups I realised that my soul needed more nourishment than my body. My body was gone. Nothing could save it now. I shut myself in my room and took a few deep breaths. I guess that was Yoga for me. I tried sitting straight. But then thats  not a very comfortable position. (I still think all the yogis of yore pulled off a PR stunt and did not really spend months in the same uncomfortable position).And an uncomfortable position does not do wonders for your concentration. And Yoga is all about concentration isnt it?. So i propped up a few pillows and breathed in tonnes of air though my nostrils. I could feel it filling my lungs. When I sensed the lungs pushing against my liver, I stopped and tried to hold my breathe. My wasnt i Pleased. The sudden surge of oxygen to the brain did the same thing to me as those endless marijuana sessions in college had done. Just that this was healthier.   As I broke out of my reverie, I imagined myself to have attained salvation. Its a different issue that I imagine myself to have attained salvation whenever I am doped outta my wits too. But since you cant get stoned with your parents around this was as good.  My message to all fellow rectians who cant get a kick cos their parents are around-"Try Yoga".   May 05 2004 - Mani makes an attempt at resigning  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  I made yet another attempt to add some spice to my life which has offlate become very bland. I mustered all my guts, (Providence gave me an offer from SAP Labs) and after a lot of soul searching, I went upto my account manager and told him, "I have decided to quit the organization". What followed next was an hour of sweet-talk. sweet-talk!!! and my account manager?!!! I was surprised. He tried his sugary coated speech on me for a good half an hour, threw in his problems for a good measure, while i was all the while telling myself - " Dont Give In, Dont give In.....". He could probably sense the affect my mental incantations had on me. So he took me to his big boss, who tried to impress upon me that they were doing all they could to resolve my issues. When his whining about the resolutions( of my issues, which will take a whole blog again to write down) could not break down my resolve, he shifted to an aggro-mode. That kind of mellowed my stance. But then hey, I wanted to see the land of opportunities too. He has promised to send me abroad( as if that was what i wanted..No, I did not want that..Or did I??). before May 24th. Failing which I will be released from my services on June 2nd. Yipppeeeee....I win both ways I guess.  The resignation has worked wonders for me. I am having a whole lot of managers queuing upto me asking me if I knew one technology or the other. Truth is I am as ignorant about technology as George W Bush Jr. is about the nuances of English Language, or about morality as a whole. I often feel guilty about making those busy guys go through so much of trouble. But then, "Hey, they get paid for it..dont they?".

						    May 07 - 2004 ----------------- George W Bush Jr. sure has a way with words. He was on air today. When asked by a typically vociferous African-American Democrat Lady about why the reports about the atrocities in Iraq were hidden for two months, Bush's typically rubbish rumblings went something like this - " Defence secretary Rumsfield is a very good secretary of defence. Secretary Rumsfield has been the defence secretary for 2 wars". Well Thats like saying, " An AIDS patient suffers from AIDS.". Coming from the "President of the United States Of America, the most powerful nation on earth"( Most of the hollywood flicks even remotely related to the highest office in the US use this phrase), it sure sounded funny.  Read another headline at Headlines Today, "The fossil of the oldest humming bird known unearthed at Germany". Good going isnt it? While the rest of the world is unearthing deadbodies from the debris left behind by bomb-blasts and suicide attacks, the Germans are taking a break from their Ghettoisms and Nazisms. Nice to know that some people are busy retrieving humming birds,swallows and cuckoos instead and livers, severed arms and rotten penises from the earth for a change. Talking about penises, I wonder what the bobbits did to the dismembered member they had in their possession.   Returning to more domestic grounds, my days at the office are as dreary as ever. No amount of self motivation succeeds. My attempt to resign was a disaster with me falling prey to all the juicy sops offered to me. I have hence postponed the decision till May 24th.

						    Arbit.........on May 12th 2004  Thats was a wonderful "Kommunication Quiz" by Ravi Venkatesh though it had be feeling depressed about not knowing most of the things. Had a coupla fags to blow out the bad feeling. Not that it helped really!!! Got to do something about my amnesia-ridden brain soon. Its getting worse by the minute. Got to get down to serious reading again too. And some exercise. Else, am afraid will end up a "veggie".  Plan to get my guitar sometime soon. Once the guy with whom it lies replies to my email.

						     Shoba De'    The other day, somebody called Shoba De' a "Prolific writer". I could only hope that the person who said this did not know the meaning of the word "Prolific".(Prolific means "intellectually productive"). If this were not true, I would have to conclude that Alas! my good friend has lost his mind, or atleast, his ability to recognise good writing from "me-too" writing.   One doesnt have to go through the tomes of sleaze and sex that she has produced, whipping up enough testosterone and oestrogen in her male and female readers respectively to keep them glued. One just has to take up a copy of the week and go through her column,to realize that what I say is true. With titles which go on something like "wild dreams" or "wet dreams" etc. etc. ( I have read her, but I dont remember the titles because they are forgettable), that are sure to catch a prurient adolescent's fancy. Nothing More! I can only rank her among the ilk of Nancy Friday, and ofcourse the writers who contribute to "MastRam"( I havent read MastRam, but it had a cult following among the Hind-pondy-Reading public in college). She talks of Feminism. But I'm sure feminism, for her, means adopting the mindset of the nascent, uppity, noveau-riche' and rare group of so-called "society" ladies who think that visiting a male strip bar and cheating on their husbands is not only their birth-right, but the way things should be with every lady worth her feminism.   This article of mine was prompted as much by my aforementioned friend's remark as well as by a column of her's that I read in THE WEEK. The title was "Where is thy sting?". She tries to dissect Sting's sex-life and yeah, in the same breath, flaunts her knowledge about Sting's real name (Gordon ....- Note: Btw she misses out on the middle name!) as well as tries to portray herself as an expert -of-sorts on all matters regarding Sex. She talks of "Tantric Sex" as if she were a direct disciple of Vatsyayana( of Kamasuthra fame..remember?). She talks about sting as if he had tried to perform before her and had failed miserably ( And by perform, I do not mean a rock concert).   But whatever be the truth about our Ms.Shoba's writing abilities, or her idea of feminism, or even her (probably) bed-room-rendezvous with sting, Her articles make good reading. Surprised? yes they make good reading because her articles are , 8 out of ten times, designed to reknidle your adolescent fantasies, and no application of your brain to comprehend. They are downright funny. But the best part is that they get published in decent, no-nonsense magazines. So you wouldnt actually have to hide your reading material from people when you are getting your dose.

						    The alter-egos    It was yet another horrendous night for me. I tossed and turned on my bed. And when your bed creaks and doesnt have a mattress on, tossing and turning on your bed can be worse than it sounds. But what bothered me more was the way Mani and Manu twisted and turned in my head, grappling and wrestling for supremacy.   Mani and Manu. I and U. Manu and Mani. U and I. Mani, ending with an I, consumed by an all-pervading egoism marked by unfettered cruelty, unmasked hedonism. Manu, ending with a U. Manu, the You in Me. Manu, the one who has given up his sense of I, nay was never endowed with a sense of I, and considers the sole purpose of his birth to be that of serving others. In short, be a "doormat". We are talking of birth. And how did their birth take place? Manu was born in the dark, unknown recesses of my creativitity-starved, talentless brain on an equally dark night as I tossed and turned on my bed, trying to calm down the frantic synaptic activity in my head. Mani was born with me. On May 15th 1979. In Hyderabad.  The nomenclature of these contradicting characters in my head was simple. I just had to follow my impulses. Mani was Me. Mani had always been along. His birth was not a birth in the true sense. His birth was just a personification of an already existing entity.I named him Mani only after being confronted with the task of naming my new-born brain-child. Mani ended with an 'I' because for him, 'I' was the end-all. Manu was U. You could be anyone. And he cared. While Mani raped, Manu cried. While Mani Killed, Manu Cried. And tried to Save.Mani stripped, Manu draped. Mani ravaged and molested my sanity. Manu was the last hope for me. Mani drove me up the wall, overpowered me with his distorted visions of victory through cruelty. Mani showed me dreams of Power. And Mani pulled me to the depths of depression when his(and now mine) dreams were shattered. Manu tried in vain to pull me out. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? No! While Jekyll and Hyde were oblivious of each other and hence did not torment the mind that hosted them, the demons I had spawned were aware of each other and hated each other's presence. And I, I try in vain to make peace.   Manu tried to save me. He was born to save me.I had given birth to him in a last ditch attempt to escape from the evil grasp that Mani held me in.   But Manu was losing out. His strength was ebbing away. He was failing in his purpose. Well, I could not blame him. Mani had fed upon me and had strengthened his base for 25 years. Mani was born with me.  Manu came 25 years later, when Mani's evil thoughts had pervaded ever living cell in my body. Manu was no match.  But is it not true that I, as their preverted creator, have the power to make Manu win. No, its not. They reign free. Atleast Mani did. And I am sure he will win. I will win.  After all, Mani's me. The I in Me.

						   Circa 2004. June 08 2004. Time 14:14:14 Location: Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A  Its been a long break from blogging. Landed in the United States Of America Last week. And it is worse than I imagined it to be. Why it is so is a long story. But right now, the fact that I have to return home to a grumpy and excessively rude young man doesnt help much. Am busy right now. And am constantly looking back to see if somebody's looking at me blogging. And friends, Creativity cannot blossom in fear. So I rest...For now. Will be back with more dough. Just wait till I get my high-speed internet connection at home. so long..ciao.

						   It's a long list. Ive lost my mind, lost my heart a few hundred times everytime a cute looking chick passed by ( well, Im afraid cigarettes r gonna cure me of that. Why? Watch DD!), lost my temper everytime sudharshan acted smart, lost my confidence when I didnt clear CAT, lost my umbrella like everybodey does(umbrellas are the most frequently lost things. FYI), lost my books 99 out of 100 times I lent it to people, lost my power to imagine cos of too much TV, lost weight due to smoking and starving, lost grades in college due to laziness, lost friends due to harsh and unthoughtful words, lose the will to live around 9 times a week everytime I think about the kind of work I am doing, and so on and so forth. Yet another instance of me being a loser. Yup..Its been just 2 weeks in the U S of A and Ive lost 900 USD. Thats like the cost of 1800 hot and glazed donuts..or better still 225 packs( 20s) of Marlboro cigarettes( thats like an year's supply for me)..or, for "pruriently" calculative mind, a little more than 10, say 10.33 Lap dances at the nearest strip club..or rather like a little less than a million INR(Not exactly..but u lose money n u know how much it hurts..I could have bought a TVS Victor and have had more smiles per hour + a few months supply of Petrol). Wah!! Wail!..And instead of drowning my sorrows in a pitcher of beer, here I am preparing Weekly Status Reports, Time Sheets ( Not just for me, but for the entire , Goddamn, *%%&*% offshore team) and MoMs(Minutes of the Meeting, Ye Morons!).  Life..Thou Art A Bitch!  { I'll be back after my mourning period..n let all you in on my extremely "eventful" trip to the US . And with the roomie I have, an extremely mild mannered, courteous, Pleansat little goddamn, F%!^#$&*#$ creep, I bet my stay is gonna be much more eventful).   A few snippets of the daily fun I have: - Mani(M) >(All happy and cheerful) Hi Roomie(Identity Concealed), Dinner's Ready! Ive made rice. Roomie(R) > (All grumpy and frowning) Eeks..Uve put in too much water. I think I gottche get down to teaching u something like cooking rice tomorrow.  Now, Guys, If I weren't so peace - loving I wouldnt have taken this from a guy, I, Perchance, landed up with just a few days back. The fact that I suffered TinTin was the fact that TinTin was mentally depraved n I felt sorry for him:-).  One More of those gems.  M> Hi Roomie You r going to the office I see? R> So! What Else? What else do u think Im doing, carrying my f**** laptop. U think I'm going for a Party.  Huh???  N the the bestest of em all.  R> U Know what! I abhor(Its my word..R doesnt speak good english!) SouthIndians!  So, right now, i feel like down in the dumps! Pray for the cash( MY CASH) all ye devout!Thats like a million rupee( around 41400 Rupee to be precise) smile to my face.

						   Just back from a horrifying trip by the US' version of our Madras State Transport Corporation- the greyhound..and trust me&nbsp;it was&nbsp;horrifying. It all started cos I had this insane urge to meet a particular person in chicago. I had flown down to chicago just a couple of weeks ago. But then I decided that I had to go again. Taking a flight was stupid because of the expenses involved. So i decided to take the greyhound instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;  A good samaritan called Pavendran agreed to drop me at the Terminal. I had just got down when a african american gentleman waved at me and said 'Hi'. Now from my 1 and a half months stay in the states I have gathered that it is normal for strangers to say hi. So I try to reciprocate, put on&nbsp;a dazzling smile and wave back at him. He rushes to me and shows me a quarter. I could not quiet make out what he meant. You know I have some problems understanding african-american accent. But then I realised that he was begging..or rather demanding money. I jumped back into Pav's car and stayed put till the danger had passed away.  &nbsp;  I braced myself and walked into the terminal. It was as clean as our chennai subways. After buying the tickets from a exceedingly helpful attendant who refused to answer even the humblest of my questions,&nbsp;I took a seat and began to do what I love doing the most..observing people. I was shocked at what kind of specimens still exist in the human race, a feeling of depression pervading me immediately.  &nbsp;  The first was a man and his wife. The man was not white..but not black either. He was one of those blacks who are not black. he was dressed in purple shoes, purple things we call bermudas back home..these reaching almost to the ankles of his short stodgy legs but not quite..purple shirt and a purple cap..all crafted from the same gaudy silky material. He had a pendant the size of a temple bell hanging from his neck to add to his intimidating appearance. I tried to eavesdrop on the conversation he was having with his wife(I do not want to describe her appearance here) out of curiosity..I just wanted to know what such people talk about. Could not make out much due to the accent problem..but then the man started making weird noises and breaking into a jig now and then. They were obscene to the core.  The next specimen was a giant who walked upto every single female, partnered or otherwise, in the terminal and offered them a cigarette..he then got down to a conversation..I particularly noticed his sitting down next to&nbsp;a lady with pitch black skin..around 6 feet tall with "Rudd Gullit" kind of hair partly died golden and partly died brown..She was interesting to look at and I could not take my eyes off her. She was exclaiming and talking aloud to herself before she got the giant to talk to.After some talking they got down to kissing. I had a very bad feeling about the whole thing. I felt I was thrust amongst aliens who might devour me and wanted to go back home.  It was with great grit and determination that I decided to board the bus finally. There were no seat numbers and so I could choose where I wanted to sit. The only place left was next to an excessively huge lady who sat on about 1.9 seats leaving only a 0.1 seat for me. I dared not complain because the last thing i wanted was a whole clan of aliens pouncing upon me and eating my guts in front of my eyes. Now aliens shooting you with ultra-slim hi-tech laser guns that give out green lights is quite cool. But you know these were not those kind.  &nbsp;  The bus stopped at Indianapolis where I had to wait for 3 hrs to catch the next bus to chicago downtown. It was almost 1 in the night and&nbsp;I was mad with hunger and lack of sleep. I had just got a pack of chips and was munching away greedily when a man who resembled pete sampras from his hair till the upper lip level ( his lower jaw was however protruding and had no teeth at all) walked upto me. The conversation went on as follows: -&nbsp;  man> Hey There..U from wheech contree?  Me> I am from India.  Man> So what you doin heer man ?? Me> ( I decide not to&nbsp;tell him I work)..I study..I am here just for 3 weeks u see..I am eating chips u see..cos I m hungry u see..my government doesnt give much grants to students u see( absolute shit!!!).  Man> Gooooodh..mee from cuba..i com thoo amereeca to row, sweeem n boaath..( wildely gesticulates with both hands). By tha way..do they give you money?  Me> Nopes..not at all..they just give me coupons that I can use..u see I carry no money at all..  Man> Hmm..Even me no money..me no familee..me alone n sleep on streets..I want to "come back to cuba" but me not doing that...when u "come back to india"...  ( a female passed by n my cuban friend winks at her..she responds with a wink..n i feel a shiver down my spine..m i being made a victim of a racket..of gangsters who operate out of terminals and rob and then kill foreigners..my imagination went overdrive and I thought I will soon be molested, robbed and killed by a gang with each member belonging to a different race, all laughing in glee and winking at each other from time to time.  Me> I go back to india next week.  Man> (Spotting a gorgeous latin girl accompanied by a huge&nbsp;africanamerican&nbsp; pre-teenager and a kid around 2 years old..)..I go make friends with baby there..then with baby's mother..(winks and goes)  &nbsp;  I get back to my chip eating but cannot help looking at the direction of the cuban ..i could see that he had got quiet friendly and they were already holding hands( another member of his gang!!.the little girl was the prop to deceive people)..&nbsp;.well..could do nothing but sigh and turn&nbsp;away...bah! why wasn't i born in cuba and resembled pete sampras till the upper lip. she was so gorgeous after all. &nbsp; The bus arrived after what seemed to be aeons. I boarded it and managed to plonk on a seat..I closed my eyes trying to sleep. I was rudely woken up by a male-teenager-voice-that-has-not-yet-broken saying, " boy oh boy, i play reel hard ..hard core..mo***r f****r. I gingerly turn back to find out who it was that had uttered these so loudly. It was the&nbsp;afro-american pre-teenager&nbsp;who was with the latin belle. He was seated behing me. His girl was seated across the aisle. And next to her was an american guy who obviously wanted to get close to her. The rest of the journey was spent sleepless, my numb brain jostled now and then by comments like below: - A-APT Boy - She is only 15 but she is taken by me..Iam 12..so u stand no choice. By the way whats ur age American Man- I am 50 (At this point I turn back to catch a glimpse of the 50 year ol lech..i cud have sworn my butt he was no more than 30). ... ... American Man- hey, I wanna get close to u... Latin Beauty- Yup I wanna do it with you but I can't... .. (noises..gosh! what's happening? mes curious but don't dare to turn back).. &nbsp; American Man- Are u scared of AIDS? Latin beauty - i am..I always ask my guys if they have it... &nbsp; I should not fail to mention here that the other guy who was all ears was the cuban who was sitting across the aisle from me. He was looking back now and then and was clearly desolate that his lady love was cavorting with the american nut.  &nbsp; The night was tiring, scary, disgusting but interesting all the same. It ended when i could see the skyline of downtown chicago. I was happy to get out of the bus and into the warm embrace of the family i was visiting, very glad and proud that I am an Indian. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
