       Well, it sure as hell doesn't help.      John Kerry's going to be on The Daily Show tonight. Man, Jon Stewart gets better guests than Conan does. And Conan's got that sweet NBC spot. This is very strange... maybe it's that Jon is funnier? Ah well, who gives a shit.      You know what I realized?  John  Kerry,  John  Edwards... John  Flansburgh,  John  Linnell. Cha, like we wouldn't notice. Nice shot at scoring a piece of the pie, Democratic presidential ticket.       There are too many Johns in my life right now... I have to take one of them out or something.       No wonder Comedy Central is owned by MTV, they run the same movies over and over just as MTV runs the same videos over and over. I've seen Dogma seventy thousand times over the last couple of months.   SOLD OUT! Cat's Cradle Carrboro, NC SAT, SEP 11  urlLink Franz Ferdinand    urlLink The Delays   urlLink The Futureheads  Doors: 8:00 pmShow: 9:00 pm SOLD OUT!!  That's right. Sold out... I've seen a bunch of unlucky bastards trying to find tickets over the internet. Good luck kids, I'll wait for youz inside.

      My first post was hardly interesting, probably because everytime i pressed return the page went down, causing a severe lack of eye-appealing one-line comments.  Such as this.  And this.  Man I hope George Bush doesn't win. I'm not saying that John Kerry will solve all our problems, but I think he'll do a better job.  If any of you are reading this, I need some help. What kind of digital camera should I get? I'm a tad bit clueless, and I need one before September 11th, when I am to be attending the Franz Ferdianand concert.

      Greetings, all and welcome to my weblog. My very cheap, "thank god for free weblog hosting" blog. I used to have a livejournal, but that got gay so I'm here. I'll tell you a little bit about myself since it's going to be fun for me.  I'm 14 years old and I live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. My life is what other people would call boring, but I like it just fine because basically, my life is music and I think just about everything else is superficial. I know, it's so cliche, being a teenager who says they 'love music' but I do think it's rare to fine someone my age who has such a passion for it as I do. There, I'm done being all smart, and now I'll get on with being entertaining. I bathe, therefore I have friends. I would write a list of bands I love, but I don't feel like it...so I'll do it later. Remind me, you person who doesn't read this. There. I just wanted to get this thing started, I'm off to go look at other people's weblogs. Much love, peace, and voting for John Kerry. Bye.
