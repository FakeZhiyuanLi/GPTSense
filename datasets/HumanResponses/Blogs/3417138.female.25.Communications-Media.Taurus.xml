      So I've just spent the last hour browsing Amazon.com.  Damn you! You are too good! I have settled on 5 choices:  1) Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness By Smashing Pumpkins Double disc set. Was stolen from me quite a few years back. I miss them!   2) Franz Ferdinand By Franz Ferdinand You may have seen their "Take Me Out" Video on MTV. What a rockin' tune. Must have.  3) Schmack! By Steriogram These kids are my age and younger. I just need to have them in my collection. What promise they have! (P.S. They have a video made almost entirely of yarn.... ponder that)  4) Stellastarr* By Stellastarr* These guys are too cool. My Coco has definitely hit on my TRL chart. They sound a little like Billy Idol (Dancin' with Myself) & the Smiths. I know that sounds odd - but that's what it sounds like!)  5) Good News... By Modest Mouse "Float On" easily makes it into my top 10 of the month.  I know some of you think I have odd taste in music. I have attached some of their websites so that you can check it out for yourself. These are all edgy, indie punk style bands. If you like the Backstreet Boys, you need not go in. Happy Listening!  www.steriogram.com www.modestmouse.com www.franzferdinand.co.uk www.stellastarr.com

      Well, Jesper was taken away today. Apparently the lady down the street had called the Animal Shelter before she found out I was keeping it, and someone had been there looking for this particular kitty. So the crazy lady came and started wigging out in my yard because she missed her kitty so bad. Jesper was hesitant to go, but if it was her kitty, then she needed to take him... Guess what his real name was... Charlie Tuna. That lady was a freak. I will miss you Jesper.. you will alway be remembered on my blog!!!  :(   (I'm crying)

I am my mother's only child (despite what she thinks) and therefore she snaps photos of me like it is the last time she'll ever see me. I mean, I know I'm cute and all, but geez, mom, give it a rest. Can't you see I'm trying to sleep here, and I open my eye- and there you are with a flipping camera! Argh!&nbsp; urlLink

      So I saw Troy today. I was looking so forward to it. Not for the dumbed down version of the Iliad, because it didn't really stick to the story. I was looking forward to it because I am like every other woman in America - Extremely Hot for Brad Pitt. Although, to me, the real hottie of this film had to be Hector, played by Eric Bana (Hoot off of Black Hawk Down).  The movie wasn't exceptional by any means. Actually for the first hour I thought I was watching a made for TV movie. If you compared it to Gladiator, which I thoroughly enjoyed, it would be a B movie in comparison... that is until you get to the scene before Hector and Achilles fight. And for a good 30 minutes there, its actually a pretty good flick. But other than that, I think those actors can act a lot better than they actually did.  It just seemed way to showy, and not enough depth.  The one person you actually want to die doesn't die (other than Agamemnon). Basically this story says, go- be a coward, and sleep with married women... you'll live longer

      It has become clear to me that I must have been Cinderella or Dr. Dolittle in a former life. I can not seem to have only 1 pet. I have recently become a foster parent to one Mr. Bojangles, a Beta fish with quite an attitude. Also, I am now an adoptive parent to a very demure yet spunky Jesper (pronounced Yes-Purr, like Jesper Parnevik the golfer)the stray kitty that has made a permanent residence.  And of course, our first born, Bailey Irish Queen -- who, by the way, doesn't quite know what to think of all of these other animals intruding on her territory. (She should just be thankful there are no mice)

       urlLink    Hello! I'm Newby - the newest member of the Reeves family. I was adopted today from the Animal Shelter. I have white paws and belly, and the rest of me is black, except for my chin and 1/2 of my top lip(as you can see!) My new sister Bailey keeps trying to "nip" me. If you ask me, she's a little crazy. But I just sit there and let her do it, because I'm only 6 weeks old. Bailey asked me if I did drugs too (bc she takes herbs everyday) and I said I brought my own. Got a dime bag of cat nip in my new room. Man, my mom's so cool...&nbsp; urlLink

      I am not one for pushing my beliefs on anyone, nor do I intend to here. Those who know me, will know that I try to be as open-minded as possible. The following is an excerpt from a website that I have found, that pretty much sums up how I feel about what is going on right now in the Middle East. If you feel the same, please feel free to visit the website also, and take a look around. If you do not, well, I respect your opinion, and hope that you will do the same for me. I don't agree with everything on the site, but I do agree with the Pledge of Resistance. I do not want to live my life in fear. I am not against the Soldiers, I'm against the War.   We believe that as people living in the United States it is our responsibility    to resist the injustices done by our government, in our names Not in our name will you wage endless war there can be no more deaths    no more transfusions of blood for oil Not in our name will you invade countries bomb civilians, kill more children    letting history take its course over the graves of the nameless Not in our name will you erode the very freedoms you have claimed to fight for Not by our hands will we supply weapons and funding for    the annihilation of families on foreign soil Not by our mouths will we let fear silence us Not by our hearts will we allow whole peoples or countries to be deemed evil Not by our will and Not in our name We pledge resistance We pledge alliance with those who have come under attack for voicing opposition to the war or for their religion or ethnicity We pledge to make common cause with the people of the world to bring about justice,freedom and peace Another world is possible and we pledge to make it real.    urlLink http://www.notinourname.net/index.html
