      I'm going to keep this blog running for a bit longer and back it up over at the Blogger site I set up the other day. I may switch over entirely just for simplicity's sake later. But I've been distracted this weekend so I haven't had much time to mess with either.  And I need some breakfast now. More distractions.

      Grandparents. . . . . . . The Beloved Spousal Unit and I are going to be grandparents. Next January apparently. There's been a ultrasound exam to confirm the circumstance already.  But we're NOT READY! Nevermind if the parents-to-be are ready or not- we're not ready! Yikes! Being grandparents means being old- doesn't it? It does to me.  I am the oldest of my siblings and two of my younger brothers are both grandparents already. I take great pleasure in hassling both of them about being old because they are grandpas and now that bit of smug superiority has been stripped from me. I will have to admit that I too am old, over the hill, just waiting for a chance to spoil my first grand child.  Everyone I know that has access to their grandkids tells me they are great. Spoil them, play with them, then send them home with the parents. I have been teasing the BSU for some time now that we need to buying a DVD player and stocking up on all the cartoon movies that come out just so we would have them when the grandkids came for a visit. I guess I was foretelling just a bit too accurately.  Anyway, congratulations to Son Kye and daughter-in-law Sara, they are the expectant parents. Kye called with the news last night. We're shocked. They are too. A new generation begins.

      That was the warm-up research paper that was due that I mentioned Sunday evening. It is about Hot Wheels toy cars and although I admit to throwing it together in a hard fought afternoon, I'm pretty pleased with the results. It ran almost 1/2 page long but I don't think I'll get dinged for that. I emailed it to my instructor last night before the concert but discovered this morning that her email address on the syllabus is wrong and so it bounced back to me.  Now I just can't wait to see what kind of grade I get on it! And if I get creative and figure out someplace to post the file online, I'll share it with everyone. I suppose there must be a way through my Comcast web page...

      and what a show it was!   urlLink Simon & Garfunkel still have it  Review by Michael Yount, The Salt Lake Tribune  Art Garfunkel reminded the Delta Center crowd early Tuesday night that the upcoming 50th anniversary of rock 'n' roll also marked the 50th anniversary of his friendship with Paul Simon.    Simon quickly chimed in that it was also the 48th anniversary of when the duo began arguing.    Whether their reunion is sincere or simply a money-making endeavor wasn't of much consequence to those in the mostly full arena. Imagine this in your mind for just a moment; Paul Simon, standing alone on center stage with a 12 string guitar. Now hear the very first chords of "The Sounds of Silence" and feel the connection of recognition within the first three notes. It was almost eery to be able to know what song it was by such immediate and overwhelming connection to the synapses in my brain. And the BSU said the same thing on the way home, that song, those first few notes and a connection was made.  RATS! Blogger just ate my post! Now I have to try to redo the few witty paragraphs I already put in here...  Long story short then, it was a terrific show. "The Hazy Shades of Winter" was cranked up into a full-on rock and roll song that I felt didn't quite fit but nearly everything else was perfect. It was expensive, too much really but the spouse said she really had a good time and would like to go to more concerts as the come along. So I'm certain that if I suggest buying tickets, she will be in an funds-approving mode for a while. Rod Stewart's coming to town in September and we may attend that one to reprise seeing him back when we were still dating. Might just have to do that show...

      that this two classes schedule is really crimping my life! I'm supposed to have a 3 page paper written by tomorrow night and I have changed my subject about 3 times while I tried to find the material that would either support or refute my intended thesis. And every time I would start researching I would end up side tracked and not finding what I needed.  So I'm doing a paper on Hot Wheels. The ones from Mattel. You know the ones, the 99 cent toys you see in the bins at Wal-Mart. Did you know they are 36 years old? Did you know that Mattel claims to have sold more than 2 billion of these cars? How about that there are currently 25,226 items listed under the Hot Wheels banner for sale at EBay?  Its 10:20, I'm tired and I've written two paragraphs. If I don't get to bed on time, tomorrow will be shot to crap. And tomorrow night's the ultimate date with the BSU, we have tickets to the Simon & Garfunkle concert! So I have to get to bed tonight on time, I have to finish my paper in the afternoon tomorrow and email in to my instructor since I'm skipping class tomorrow night. Easy, right?

      to last week's email that I sent them concerning the local Culligan office and  urlLink my discontent over the brine tank, the tackily written demand for payment and the $150 cost.  Its a tie game I guess.   Nathaniel,   Thanks for writing.  Every customer is considered our highest priority, and I can certainly understand your frustration and point of view regarding the dispute with Culligan of Ogden UT.  I have had the opportunity to speak with Bob Ball, the General Manager of this independant franchisee, and he has fully investigated the matter you presented.  The dealer has indicated that there is no record whatsoever of the brine tank in question being returned, and in light of this lack of documentation he unfortunately will not be able to offer you any removal or reduction of the bill.   The dealer assured me he has also reviewed the customer service response you had received in writing, and is dealing with that issue internally.  I have made sure that your complaint against the dealer has been logged in our permanent database at the corporate headquarters.  Please accept my apology on behalf of Culligan International.Sincerely, Michael Mayschak  Consumer Affairs Specialist  Office of the President Culligan International  1 Culligan Parkway  Northbrook IL 60046 (800) 947-4759  (888) 777-8715 fax  mmayschak@culligan.com    Note that Mr. Mayschak didn't address the ridiculous price of the brine tank at all. He did at least make certain that the local folks know just how unhappy I was with their service.

      The transmission is in the Subaru. The job's not finished for a couple parts that had to be ordered. It was lots of hard work. Son Noah and I worked Saturday and Sunday getting everything back together. I'm sunburnt and cranky and my schoolwork didn't get done.  So that leaves me tonight to research and write a paper and try to get the yard mowed. And I've got to get a part ordered for Lily's car. And do my paying work too. There's lots of that today.  And the boy did something really, really stupid over the weekend that may put the planned trip for his summer break out of the question. You see, Lily was out of town at her grandmother's and he finds Heather, her best friend to hang out with Friday night. Pretty soon after that potentially relationship breaking complications occur. Heather's willing to leave it unsaid with Lily, Noah's taking the "gotta tell the truth no matter how painful" tact and so he may be girlfriend-free after Wednesday night when he gets home from Job Corp. Serves him right if that's how it turns out.

      And I never even got around to telling you about last weekend. So, since old news is really no more useful that bird cage liner and fish wrap, I'll try to just give you some highlights.  As mentioned before, there was DRAG RACING! Son Noah and I went off on our first trip to  urlLink Rocky Mountain Raceway  on Saturday night. We had a wonderful time, got to see some excellent racing and had our first experience with a Top Fuel Funny Car. (I've searched for a link to the car unsuccessfully. Sorry)   The announcer claimed that this supercharged, nitromethane burning racer created 6000 horsepower! I can't confirm if that is true but I can confirm that when the lights went green and the driver blasted off that it felt like the doors of hell had been cracked open! That thing blew blue flames 20 feet in the air and the the pulses coming out of the zoomie headers left imprints on my chest as the car passed by! Wow! I like to be close to race cars and such and while I take normal precautions to protect my hearing, I can tell you that this was the noisiest piece of hardware I have ever been exposed to! The driver shut it off at the 1/8 mile mark and was still going over 225 mph at the 1/4 mile mark!  I for one cannot imagine having the skills and reflexes to drive a beast like that under full power. The one we watched was not competing but making an exhibition run and we only got to see it once, though Noah wanted it to go again after he blasted past us the first time.   So the drag races were good fun and we will be going back there again in the future. On Sunday we headed back out for more racing, this time to spectate racing karts. I've been a kart racing fan for many years and when I heard about a national event being held at the local track, why we just had to go check it out.  The racing was at  urlLink Black Rock Raceway  and it is as fine a kart facility as I have ever visited. This place is really first class and just 75 miles from home. Anyway, we got there late after dawdling over breakfast but in time to see the final 3 races of the day. This is exciting stuff! The 125cc shifter karts actually get down the front straightaway in under 4 seconds with a top speed of just about 90 mph before turning into a sharp 180 degree turn! If you check out the track configurations on the website, they were running the "full reverse" track while we were there.  Lots of exciting racing and afterwards some pleasant conversation with several of the racers in the pits. They were happy to share info and answer our questions and one of them even handed Noah his digital video camera that he uses inconjunction with a helmet cam. Noah got lost watching the racing from the driver's view and didn't want to give back the camera!   So that was last weekend. Lots of racing and racing noises and smells and track-side burgers. Just about a perfect father's day weekend! And after I go get more coffee, I'll tell you about this weekend!

      For my XSU's long-time spousal unit. She sent me an email this afternoon. Her hubby has melanoma and he required removal of several lymph nodes under his arm yesterday. The surgery apparently went well and the Doc's are predicting no further cancer but they are still waiting on pathology reports that won't be completed before Wednesday.  So it been a strssful week for her family. Any of you that believe in the power of prayer might add these folks to your list for the next few days. I know I will.

      Some of you might remember that a few months ago I replaced my rental water softener with a purchased one. The rental belonged to the Culligan Water people, the purchased machine did not come from them but Sam's Club instead. I really hated that rental machine, it was noisy in operation, oversized and took up too much room in the laundry room and I really hated paying Culligan every month. I resented their monthly bills and everything about the arrangements. So when I got the opportunity to change the circumstances, I did. And ever since then I've been been trying to get these folks off my back.  You see, the day that I returned the softener unit, I forgot to load up the separate brine tank at the same time. The unit was heavy and ungainly and a bit of a struggle for me to manage single-handedly out of the basement, up the stairs and into the back of the truck. And, the stupid brine tank was behind the laundry room door, so out of sight while I chuffed the heavy piece out of the house.  Anyway, I returned the softener, paid up and closed out my account and promised to return the following day with the brine tank. Which I did. I took it right out back of the building where all the other 20 or so brine tanks lived, unloaded it and gave my name to one of the guys that worked there. He promised to tell the front office that I had kept my end of the arrangement. Which he did not do!  A few weeks go by and I received a bill, for $150 for the missing brine tank! Whaa? I ever so politely showed up at their office and I explained to the staff and the owner of the place that I did return the tank and that it was out back with all the others. After all, why would I keep this stupid plastic tank? The owner promised to query his guys and to try to verify my story and he promised to get me an answer.  Which he did. Through his "collections manager." I received this letter in the mail the other day:   CULLIGAN WATER  1595 WEST 2550 SOUTH OGDEN, UTAH 84401  PHONE 801-XXX-XXXX FAX 801-XXX-XXXX   NATHIANL R MCCORD	 JUNE 22, 2004 XXXX RUSHTON AVENUE  OGDEN, UT 84401   I TRIED TO CALL YOU TO DAY ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT WITH CULLIGAN.   I HAVE CHECKED WITH EVERYONE THAT WORKS OUT OF OUR CULLIGAN OFFICE. NO ONE CAN RECALL YOU BRING IN THE BRIME TANK THE NEXT MORNING.   THEREFORE THE BILL THAT I SENT. TO YOU WILL STAND AND I NEED PAYMENT ON IT WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.   PLEASE CALL ME SO WE CAN WORK THlS OUT, I'M JAN @ 801-627-XXXX.   COLLECTIONS MANAGER No kidding, that is exactly the way the letter looks! Its all capitalized, my name's misspelled and Jan doesn't even get the type of tank in dispute spelled correctly.  So I wrote Jan a response and I made payment arrangements: June 25, 2004  Culligan Water 1595 West, 2550 South, Ogden, UT 84401  Jan:  It pains me to believe that you persist in billing me for a brine tank which I had no reason to keep or reason to lie about its prompt return. What possible reason would I have for keeping it? The space that the brine tank robbed from my laundry room was a principle reason that I elected to replace the Culligan rental unit with one of my own and to sever my ties with your company.  I’m also not used to having my credibility called into question and that is another reason why I feel very justified in making a water softener purchase that did not include further business with Culligan. I have endeavored to the best of my skills to behave as an honest member of society and while not perfect, I strive every day to meet my obligations and to be recognized as an honorable citizen. I resent the fact that my word is unacceptable regarding this brine tank’s timely return.  So, as indicated on the attached pages, I have made arrangements to pay the exorbitant replacement cost of the brine tank as you have requested. I believe that $150 is an outrageous price to put on that flimsy bit of plastic barrel and ball float but I will pay it (under protest) to absolve my mailbox from any further mail from your company.  Beginning July 1, 2003 and continuing on a bi-weekly basis for 5 months, Culligan will receive directly from America First Credit Union, a check for $15.00. The final payment will be sent on November 4, 2004.  I will not respond to or pay any further late fees, services charges or penalties. You demanded $150, that’s what I’m paying. I have included the documentation so that you can see that this payment scheme is already in place and that I need to take no action to ensure your regular payment.   I also suggest that you ask your employer to pay for your participation in a business writing class to enhance your communication and letter writing skills. Your letter of June 22, 2004 had my name misspelled, two incomplete sentence fragments, more misspelled words and it was written in all capital letters. This letter reflects poorly on your letter writing skills and in my mind the overall quality of your company. It does not generate in me the belief that I am dealing with a professional organization. If you call yourself a collection manager, you need to be able to present yourself as a professional and your letter is substandard in that regard.  Sincerely,  NATHANIEL R. MCCORD I faxed it off early this morning so that I would be certain that it arrived before Jan did. Its 11AM and I haven't heard a peep from her or her boss. I did not call Jan to "work this out" since I felt that I had already tried to do that 3 weeks ago.  The only question I have is, should I have made the payments stretch for even more weeks or was 10 weeks long enough?   UPDATE: I found an email address for the corporate headquarters of Culligan and asked them if $150 was a reasonable price to pay for that brine tank. I also included copies of the letters, the terrible one I received demanding payment and my response letter. No word back yet, I expect it might take a couple days to trickle through the corporate system...

       urlLink This  makes me feel better about the wads of money I leave in their cash registers most every weekend! The company said it is sending nine truck trailers to the military, filled with 100,000 tools and materials, including shovels, table saws, concrete mixers, safety scaffolding, power generators, light bulbs and jackhammers. The donated goods left San Diego on Thursday.   Earlier this year, the company also donated $1 million, as well as a million volunteer hours by its employees, to help military families repair and maintain their homes while a family member is deployed.   Thanks, Home Depot! Good on ya!

      I tried, just now to go get a good link to a picture of the Stevens Favorite that I mentioned in the previous post. Since its made by Savage Arms, their website seemed to be a good place to look. The network monitors that control all our web visiting and implement the filters to ensure that we aren't watching  Frank Does Fort Worth  or shopping all day on EBAy also have the Savage web page blocked.   The heading under which it was restricted was "mature." WTF? So I guess later, from home, I'll get you a link.

      ...if the connection will keep working. Its lousy or worse this morning.   One bit of good news, I just plunked my money down on a replacement  urlLink Stevens Favorite 22 rifle.  I found a pair of brand new ones, made by Savage for a real good price and Bob my local gun dealer and coworker decided that he would like one for his inventory. So the deal's in the works and shortly I will have another rifle in my locker. This one will be a regular shooter for all the time. I'm still looking for the "just right" original Stevens but that will have to take a back seat to next month's vacation.   In case you were wondering, "a real good price" is $285 deliverd for both guns! Check out the suggested retail on the link. I also saw these for sale locally just last week for $189 plus tax...

      Later today I hope to be able to fill in the details of a fun filled weekend. But I can't right now.  I did want to let you know that I'm again using a cell phone and I have a second one working for son Noah's use. His impending road trip was the driving [snark!] factor that pushed me into looking for an affordable cell plan.  I think I found one. Its  urlLink Ecallplus.com.  Unlike many of the prepaid cell services that are available that insist you buy  another  phone, Ecallplus has provision for reusing a phone you already own. And since I'm a cheap bastard and since I already owned two serviceable phones, this seemed like a really fine idea.  So, for less than $160 I've got two phones running and each has 433 minutes of talk time paid for. I call that a pretty good deal. Its actually $.15 per minute to use and local and long distance costs the same. There's no "free" minutes after 9pm or any of that "stuck in a contract for two years" business. Its pay as you go and I did it all online and through email and it was painless getting signed up.  If you need a cell service and are looking for an economical method of connection and you don't mind keeping an old phone out of the landfill for a while longer this might be a good solution for you too.  If you want to call me, you're going to have to ask...

      In reference to the previous post, the reason I get email from my XSU, in case you were wondering is because of my son, Nate who has lived with her since our split many moons ago. He's 24 now, 25 at the end of the month and a fine young man. The ex keeps me up to date periodically on his successes and I get to be proud of him from a too long distance. She even sent me a picture of him today, sitting in a shiny, new Viper roadster that he apprently got to drive home from the Chrysler dealer where he's a mechanic. He's a handsome young guy and there's no removing the smile from his face for showing up with that car to impress his mom!  And the XSU is a regular reader here too! How 'bout that? BTW, the current BSU thinks its weird... tough.

       urlLink Pilot Crashes, Dies Fighting Wildfire  Things are already bad in the Forestry Service's aircraft division due to the grounding of almost the entire fleet after last year's disasterous crashes. You might remember that they lost a couple of airplanes when the wings just folded up and fell off and a couple crews died as a result. Most of the airplanes remain grounded though I did read a couple weeks ago that if the money could be found to have the aircraft inspected and declared air-worthy that some of them might get returned to service.  Its early in the fire season yet and loosing a critical resource like a pilot and airplane really will put a crimp in the fire-fighting abilitys across the region.

      I know that I have been sounding like I'm whining about my workload lately and the fact is these two classes are keeping me hopping pretty hard. But life is not all drudgery and nose-to-the-grindstone ugly so I promise to expunge the whining from my posting as much as I can.  Fact is, last night I went with the Hill AFB Ski Club back down to  urlLink Speedstreet Racing  for a little indoor racing action. As a club, this was our second trip to go racing and I'm just a little proud that it was my idea in the first place.  We had aboout 10 folks racing and we did a 8 minute qualifying race first, had some pizza over a bench racing session then went back for a 25 lap race. I did get to start in the pole position for the big race since I won the qualifying race and had the fastest time. Now I'm not bragging or anything, but in 25 laps I passed everybody except the guy in 2nd place! Some of the folks I lapped twice...  So a good time was had by all and everyone thinks that the racing is great fun, even those that haven't done it before. Its always fun to introduce folks to this, especially women because they normally aren't used to the idea of blocking the line into corners and real passing manuevers so when they get a chance and the opportunity some of them are dandy racers.  As usual, our host, Jeff was a fine proprietor and did his best to ensure that everyone had a good time. He even asked me, off to the side, if I ran a web page of some sort... Seems he Googled his SpeedStreet and found Wasted Electrons close to the top of Google's list from a previous post. He thought it was kind of nice that I was promoting his endeavor. Its really no problem to promote a place where I have such a grand time, so "thanks Jeff!" I needed the break.

      when you're double and triple-tasking all day? It certainly does for me! Anyway, the paper for tonight's class is complete and all I need to do  right  now is read about 40 pages  and  decide on a research topic for my short research paper. I'm strongly leaning towards a discussion of Islam and its claim to be a "religion of peace" for my final research paper though I haven't locked myself to that subject just yet.  For my more pressing paper I'm still in search of a good subject, something I can argue. I'll take suggestions. I think it might have to be related to either self defense as either a right or a privilege or it might have to be a comparison of the 1st Amendment's protections vs. the 2nd Amendment's similar protection. I'll just have to wait and see.  Anyway, I'm still busier than a 3 legged cat in a litter box and the weekend is shaping up to have more fun things to to than there is time for. Gotta run.

A day after this West Jordan lumberyard went up in flames KSL News Radio received a fax claiming to be from the Earth Liberation Front. It says ELF targeted the Stock Building Supply, because it ignored warnings to repair its forklifts, which the organization says,  put out more pollutants than average diesel engines .   The arsonists appear to have no remorse. The release goes on to say, “If the consequences are what it takes to bring the company's negligence to the media and the people of the world, then it is well worth it and ELF will continue its mission, to stop large companies from destroying the environment.”  So according to these mental giants, this brand new lumber yard, probably not two years old was torched because their fork lifts were gross polluters! They didn't go after  urlLink Mag Corp  or any of the gross polluter opportunities here behind the Zion Curtain. One recent study by the Public Interest Research Group found that among all states, Utah ranks fourth nationally in the release of chemicals that affect child development and learning. Tooele County ranked first in the nation among counties.  The No. 1 air polluter in all of North America — Magnesium Corp. of America (MagCorp) — is located on the western shore of the Great Salt Lake, upwind from 1.5 million people living along the Wasatch Front. You know I have a name for people like these unwashed Earth First!ers, don't you? What's the name for people like this? Its DUMBASS!

      How do I get my BSU involved in the bext trials?  urlLink FDA Panel Backs Implant To Counter Depression   A surgical implant that stimulates the brain should get government approval to treat chronic depression, an expert panel of federal experts said yesterday -- marking the first time an implanted device has been recommended for the treatment of a psychiatric disorder.   Using a technique known as vagus nerve stimulation, the device uses electrodes implanted in the neck to activate brain regions that are believed to regulate mood.  I think she might be a very good candidate for a treatment like this and I'll be watching to see if this implant gets approval. When it does, I'll be banging on the spouse's Doc's door requesting it!  BTW, last week was the 2nd anniversary of her most recent attempt to take herself off the planet. So that required a bit of discussion and consideration and I tried to make it a celebration of sorts but with only minor success. She no longer thinks every day about assuming room temperature voluntarily but her illness is still keeping her in bed or on the couch nearly 100% of the time.  So if implants and electrodes and batteries become a possibility for treatment, she's there!

       urlLink From FunctionalAmbivilent...  Now, let me just stop you right here. I want everyone to take a moment to picture Hatch, in the willowy spring of his youth, away from home for the first time, neatly dressed and bright-eyed, indulging his ardor for writing poetry. Got it? OK, let's move on. Orin's got 6 new albums?  Last year, according to the Houston Chronicle, Hatch made $33,000 in royalties on the more than 300 songs he has co-written. The songs have titles like, "God Bless Our Homes and Families" and the weirdly Yakov Smirnoffian "You Gotta Love This Country."  He's also got polygamist family in his history that he's not too ashamed of, after all, they were good, hard working folks that made a life in this pioneer state...

      Is that a word? Is it the  best  word? I heard it used by a middle school principal today during an interview on NPR. Wouldn't  disproportionate  be as effective a word?  That word kinda got stuck going down my my ear pipe today. I think that it was an "educator" who said it might be one reason it didn't slide down easily. [ed note- can I get away with using scary quote marks like Reuters?]   Just something I noticed today.  UPDATE: Yup, its a word. I found it  urlLink here.

      Picking luscious, fat, bursting with sweetness cherries out of my own tree. I love it! Our little tree in the front yard has really outdone itself this summer and it is heavy with delicious fruit. I ate a couple (ok, several) handfuls last night while mowing, I just had to stop as I passed by and pick as many as my cheeks would hold and then carry on mowing. On my way out to the car this morning- a little divert over to the tree and I had another handful to eat while I drove to work.  Summer is here. Yumm!

      Well as previously mentioned, mine was not a weeknd of leisure. Instead it was filled with fun challenges, grease, (the grimy black kind, not the grilling kind) and a trip to the airshow.  Friday was "get the stripped out Subaru out of the driveway" day and that wasn't too tricky except that we removed the steering column, making changing its direction a real challenge. Lucky for me that I didn't take for granted the scrap metal collector being good to his schedule as I called to try to nail down a time and found out that my pick-up had fallen off their calendar. He did make it over pretty quickly after I got back on the schedule but he didn't bring me the $15 I had been promised the first time I called. I'm just happy to have it gone!  That Subaru had to depart to make room for Lily's similar Subaru which needs a transmission transplant. Her car began slipping mighty quickly after she bought it and has gotten worse in a significant way. From a stop the car barely will climb any of the local hills and it revs quite freely for a number of seconds before the parts all get spinning and engaging in the proper manner. So, Saturday morning, up on the jack stands it went for it's transplant.  I really thought that since son Noah and I had already gotten good and dirty on the donor car that this swap would go smoothly. Hah! In reality, nothing went terribly wrong but there was a lot of steps to the removal process and it took us until almost dinner just to get the transmission out from under the car.  [Ed note,there's a 5 hour break right here.]  The first complication turned out to be the torque converter to flywheel bolts. The book says you are to remove them through a small port on the top of the engine case or through a tiny gap between the oil pan and the crossmemember. WRONG! Removing bolts through either of those two choices would have required a miracle and probably words detrimental to a miracle actually being performed. Hmm, what to do? Well, there's no dust cover on the bottom of the bellhousing like most cars with the engine in the front and the transmission behind it, that area is covered up by the crossmember and the power steering rack. But hey, there's a big slot in the crossmember just above the rack and its only held in place by 4 bolts. I'll pull that down and see what I can see.  I can see a big slot and just above it the ring gear. I can even see the 4 bolts I need to remove, I just can't get a wrench on them. Where's my air powered cutoff wheel? I'll enlarge the slot! And that's what I did. It took two different tools with cutoff wheels but I enlarged just enough of the existing slot that I could get the torque converter bolts out. Heh!  Next, you must remove the lower control arms to get the axle shafts loose from the transaxle. That leaves everything hanging down low and in the way of my head. More words get said here, again preventing any miracles. And it seems that there is just no room to actually move the transmission out from under the car now that there are suspension bits hanging down and the leg of a crane that's been brought into action to tilt the engine and the jack stands that hold the entire mess up off my head, so- I removed the entire driver's side suspension. There wasn't much holding it in place anyway by this point and with just a couple more bolts and a brake hose removed it was loose in the driveway. That opened up the hole where the tranny could finally emerge into the daylight.  Of course there was more shaking and lifting and grunting before the tranny could finally be coaxed away from the engine and be lowered to the ground. The good news is we didn't break anything getting it out. By the time we were to this point it was too late to consider getting the new tranny back into the hole and reassembled so we knocked off for the night and had a good cleanup. Tricky work over all and son Noah and I were both pretty worn out.  The tranny still has to go back in... But that will have to wait until next weekend because Sunday was dedicated to homework and the air show! And you will have to wait to read more about it because its 9 PM and I still must write a review for tomorrow's writing class! And I'm tired because I came home and mowed the lawn tonight since I can't do it tomorrow night and the trash truck comes on Wednesday.  Crap I'm tired!

       urlLink White House rejects calls for change of stem cell policy :  "In 2001, Bush signed an executive order limiting federally funded research to 78 lines of embryonic stem cells then in existence. However, researchers say the number of lines actually available is now 19 -- and contamination may make those unusable"  There's just no reason in my mind for not expanding on this research. Everything I have read so far has described outstanding and remarkable developments in the use of stem cells.  I think President Bush is making a huge mistake by not already getting on-board with support of those scientists working to save lives using stem cells. Unfortunately, if he were do do it now it would look like campaign grandstanding on the memory of President Reagan and that would make it a political hot potato instead of just a good idea that needs to be supported.

      Man, what I might do to get my weekends to look like those on the beer and hot dog commercials that I occasionally see on the tv box. You know the ones, long, idle days spent relaxing on the beautifully manicured lawn, hanging out with a group of buddies, grilling and just generally taking it easy. That is NOT how weekends are spent at my house.  Instead, it was a weekend of getting cars hauled away, removing a transmission from another car and attending the air show on the base on Sunday. There was also yard work in an effort to get a portion of the back yard reseeded, homework  and a movie to watch while I dozed off on the couch.  Details later. After class and after I complete the writing I am doing to support my eating habit.

      Terry has outdone himself this morning with a tribute to President Reagan that you must not miss. This is eloquent, moving and laser beam precise. Read it  urlLink here.  "For those who are blind to the promise and hope inherent in America, who take joy in her failings, who debase and demean her contributions to civilization, who mewl and purr at the feet of her enemies--for those, you are not fit to walk the streets with Americans. The shoes on your feet are empty of humanity, the space you occupy hollow of meaning. The backwards boots in the stirrups of the saddle, though seemingly empty, are full. The horse, though riderless, carries a life lived loving America." Thanks Terry for saying so well what many of us could not express so lovingly.

       urlLink The $744 Power Cord  from Gizmodo.com. The new Golden Reference Power Cord from Cardas provides a significant performance upgrade to the AC cords supplied with most hi-fi and home theater components.

      I know that I'm a grinch about grammar even if you can't tell from my scribblings here. I intentionally write casually and colloquially simply because that's also how I talk most of the time. But I consider myself to be a decent wordsmith and something of a grammar grinch when I'm writing for business or looking at other people's work.   Imagine then my surprise when I received my text book yesterday, just in time for my first night of Writing Purposes and Research class. The book's title is  urlLink The Little, Brown Handbook.  I took one look at the title to this book and said, "What the heck's that comma doing in that title?" My puny brain says that the comma does not belong there.  I even asked the instructor last night, she thought that comma might be redundant too. So, having 968 pages of the finest writing specific instructions between the covers of this new book, I went digging to find out about that dangling character. And there it is, on page 480, instructions for using a comma to separate  coordinate adjectives . The secret here is that coordinate adjectives modify the same word equally. If one adjective is more closely related to the noun then the adjectives must not be separated by a comma.  There are actually 4 rules for determining if adjectives are coordinate or not. The most important rule is can the word and be inserted between the adjectives without changing the meaning? If the answer is yes, the comma goes between coordinate adjectives. If the answer is no, then no comma is used.  Did the rest of you folks know this already? Am I the last to learn this essential rule of comma usage? Does anybody else find this as interesting as I do?  You folks could be in big trouble because I like this book!

       urlLink CNN.com - 'Too old' 'ER' actress axed    British actress Alex Kingston says she has been axed from the hit U.S. hospital drama "ER" because she is too old.  Kingston, 41, who plays the widowed surgeon Elizabeth Corday, said she was "shocked and upset" when she learned her contract would not be renewed.  "Apparently I, according to the producers, the writers, am part of the old fogies who are no longer interesting," she told the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine.  ER is the spouse's favorite television program and the world stops on Thursday evenings when her show is on. Loosing one of her favorite characters is going to upset her applecart!  And I for one, think that Alex is a hottie and none too old. Of course a good looking, red-headed woman with a British accent is probably always going to turn my head...

"I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world." Poof! She's gone.   In astonishment, "Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of piña coladas, and the love of my life." Poof! He's gone.   OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."   Moral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.

      After reading and posting about the Politics of Panties, which nobody seemed to care enough to leave a comment about, I've been going back to  urlLink FunctionalAmbivilent  for a few days now. The writer is smart and witty and writes intelligently about sex every Friday. There's other subject matter during the resto of the week including his quest to rid our currency system of the nickel. And the quarter too.  I've also been stalking  urlLink this blog  for a few days, its called Hog On Ice. Let's face it, not everybody can write this: When sex is good, there's always a bit of a predatory edge to the male role. No matter how loud and obnoxious your lady is during the day, and even if she never lets you drive, you have to be the big bad wolf, with eyes that glow in the dark like the dot from a laser sight, and she has to be the soft, quivering, helpless little bunny. Sometimes you're going to have to bite, and sometimes you're going to want to leave some welts so you have something to grin at each other about the next day, while you're having lunch with your pastor. You can't really do that well unless you search inside yourself until you find Batman.  The dark, tortured Michael Keaton Batman, not the ambiguously gay George Clooney Batman, or the "Let's see if we can get one more drink from this dry old tit" Val Kilmer Batman.  He also writes about food and cooking, he's written and published a cookbook and he posted a story about a  urlLink documentary film being made  about  Michael Moore!

      Ok, here's the post, re-written as best I can manage from the inadvertent "oops" of this morning.  First there was  urlLink this link  to a story about David Kingston. He's been in court for a number of days now. Seems he can't remember all his children's names- from just one of the 10 women he calls a wife!  Today, (May 21) Kingston took the stand in court. When asked to name all of his children, he struggled trying to remember all of their names.   Andrea Moore Emmett, Utah NOW: “He started out he named probably five then he started over. Then he counted and named three. And then he tried again. He asked for water, said he was nervous, and he never did name all of his ten children by this particular wife."   And then after consulting with his attorney he claimed his 5th Amendment rights on all questions concerning his children's names.  It gets better- Caseworkers for the state have investigated the Foster home four times in the past decade for neglect and extremely unhealthy living conditions.   A police report was filed in February after a three and five-year old child were found walking along a busy road alone. The report goes on to say that when the Kingston kids were taken back home, the investigating police officer says she walked into a home that was filthy, smelly, full of garbage and rotting food, and this is how the Foster children were living. Note the February mention. This is Utah and February is a lousy time for kids to be on the streets...  Here's  urlLink the results  from Kingston's trial.    A juvenile court judge has ruled that two children fathered by prominent polygamist John Daniel Kingston were abused and neglected.   Judge Andrew Valdez ruled late Thursday that an uncle and aunt who are not part of the Kingston cult will have temporary custody of the 13-year-old girl and the 15-year-old girl will be in a foster facility. Both girls will be able to visit their mother and siblings.   Valdez said they had been abused and neglected by their father and their mother had been negligent in protecting them.   Valdez said all 10 children of Kingston and Heidi Foster, who have gone by the surname of Foster, were entitled to be named Kingston and also were entitled to inheritance.   "The name is Kingston, sir, and they have a right to their own names," Valdez said. This right to inheritance could be a problem since- Kingston is believed to have approximately 100 children with around 14 wives.  But it shouldn't be too big of a problem. After all- The Kingston clan, also known as the Order, includes an estimated 1,200 members. The secretive group has amassed a $150 million business empire, running companies that include pawn shops, restaurant supply stores, dairies and mines. Well, that's just one of the things that makes living in Utah interesting! How's life in your state?

      This Blogger page is starting to shape up and feel a little more like home. I still can't get the margins and box widths set to my satisfaction though.  Yesterday was productive and I finished the window air conditioner installation. I had to manufacture a fill-in panel to keep the cool air in and the bugs and hot weather out. Everything went perfectly, right up until I tried to drill screws through the steel frame of the window to mount the cover.  Who knew there was concrete poured into those window frames when they were installed? I wrecked 3 drill bits in the space of a couple minutes! My plan was of course to drill 1/8" holes into the frame and use sheet metal screws to hold the cover in place. But run a drill bit that size with a 1/2" drill motor through the metal and into the concrete and suddenly you own a drill bit that won't drill through cheese. Crap! I did manage to get enough holes drilled to secure the cover with the help from my friendly caulking gun and some adhesive in a tube.  Its not as good as I engineered it but it acceptable. Its painted and not leaking and the ac unit itself works very nicely.

      Earlier today I put the following bit of drivel into an email. Can you regular readers guess who I sent it to?   Knock knock.  Pardon, maam, its just routine maintenance work going on. I'm here to do the monthly cleaning on your speaking tubes.  Speaking tubes? Of course, these tubes over here on the wall. You know, the ones you have to stand in front of and speak into to talk to someone far away. They get dusty if you don't use them regularly you know.  Sure, this cleaning takes just a minute. Sorry to bother you from your work. These long distance tubes really take some maintenance to keep them in order, 'never know when a crack might develop and let spiders or dirt to fall in. If that happens it takes all day to push a cleaning rag through them to clean them out and of course then you have to go track down the damaged spot and dig it up and make repairs. But its got to be done otherwise the reception just gets all bad and you can't make yourself heard or hear what the person on the other end has to say either.  Won't it be great if'n we ever get those new-fangled telephone things all the papers have been writin' about? Why, I heard that if they get the wires strung across the entire country that we should be able to talk to anyone that has a phone. This telephone thing is supposed to be even better than the telegraph since you won't have to traipse down to the telegraph office to send or get your messages. And old Chet won?t be reading your messages before you ever get them delivered from the office. Why, I heard that you will be able to talk clear out to California! Or even Utah if you knew anybody there! Won't that be remarkable? 'Course the cheapskates around here probably won't pay to have it brought into our buildings, so at least my job cleaning these pipes will be safe a few more years.  And someday, I read this in a book, someday, you are supposed to even be able to sit down at a machine on your desk and using a telegraph key or a typewriter of some kind send written words across the same lines that they are stringing to talk on using the telephone! Isn't that the wildest idea you've ever heard? Imagine. How are they ever going to make a wire big enough for everybody to use at the same time using voice and letters? Seems like everything would get all jumbled up before it ever gets to the right persons. Don't ya think?  Well anyway I'm done here. Sorry to bother you. Most of your pipes look to be in really good condition except that last one over there in the corner. Its needing some polish on that brass and there's cobwebs growing across the front of it. It will take me an afternoon to get it cleaned up and working again but if you're not using it, why it can just be left alone. Its probably better to fix it than leave it though because regular maintenance keeps everything working smoothly.  So if you want it fixed up, just give me a holler and I'll come back to get it ship-shape. Until then I'm just going to go back to figuring out how those scientists expect to send letters down an electrical wire! I'll see you again next month. Do ya suppose it might have any positive effect? I guess I'll see. Or maybe not. Hard to tell.  UPDATE! It worked! I've received one of those new-fangled letters deliverd by wires that says the speaking tube might even be cleaned out by next week! How about that?

      I just completed my company's diversity training, which as we all know is a mandatory annual requirement. I was shocked to learn that the Golden Rule that we all learned back in kindergarten has been replaced in today's work environment! You know the Golden Rule of which I speak- "Do onto others the way you want others to do onto you."  The  new , corporate Golden rule is: "treat others the way they would like to be treated." In the next segment I learned:  "Use assertive communication techniques to express how you want to be treated."  Does the name Omarossa come to your mind here? Good Grief! What an absolute pile of PC stinking-animal-dung this is!  Talk amongst yourselves while I try to get this nasty bit of feel-good crap out of my mouth!

      10,000 BTUs of air chilling refrigeration are going on right now in my family room! And I am just now showered and sitting down for the first time since leaving work. The BSU had requested a room air conditioner in the family room a few weeks ago since it is the furthest room from the swamp cooler up on the roof. There hasn't been a pressing need because the weather has been mighty temperate for the past couple weeks. But it has warmed up this week, 85 on the way home today so I decided it was time to purchase and install an ac unit.  And she of course, agreed.  So off I went to Lowes this afternoon and I carried home a Whirlpool window unit. Its big enough that it should keep the temps under control for the entire basement. I also bought the heavy duty support brace and then headed home to do the "e-z" install.  Yeah, right... The instructions on both the ac unit and the brace were designed for folks with wood sash windows, not the steel framed, set in concrete windows that I have in my basement! Argh! It only took one extra trip to Home Depot and $10 for some heavy-duty concrete screws and the special drill bit to get the mount fastened to my window frame. And more than a little bit of cursing was applied to the task as well.  But I got it done and its running quite satisfactorily. I still need a quarter sheet of plywood to finish the job which I will get tomorrow and then everything will be tidy and secure.  The BSU likes the remote control feature!

      well that's interesting. Tonight on the Blog studio sign-in page there's a note from Wayne, the guy that runs the business here at Blog Studio. He was out of the country last week on paying business and there were multiple power outages wherever the BS home is. Wayne's apologetic and promising to get everything fixed up as soon as he's back on US time.  If my archives come back I will be very, very happy. Thanks for the update Wayne!

      AN ANNOUNCEMENT- Mom, avert your eyes.  Ok then. I'm not telling how I found this link but it discusses at length a subject that I've always been interested in.  The Politics of Panties  from FunctionalAmbivalent:  Panties are worming their way up the crack of our everyday lives. This is, I know, a terrible metaphor, but I go with my strengths. Women's underwear, once so top secret that it was hidden even from women themselves, is going public in a huge way. How public, you ask conveniently, propelling this amateurishly disjointed opening forward so that we can soon get to some jokes and smutty links? Very public. In fact, panties are going so public that they're becoming a threat to life as we know it.  and then there's this: Somewhere in the early 1950s, scientists working on a secret government project discovered female orgasm. I'm not sure how it happened; maybe it was one of those civilian benefits of NASA research, like Tang. Anyway, this discovery changed completely how women viewed sex and, consequently, their own underwear. No longer was sex something to be avoided. Suddenly, sex was something to desire. In search of a way to get men's attention, women changed their whole approach to underwear. No longer did they see panties as clothing that simply contained what needed to be contained. Women recognized that the huge symbolic importance their underwear held for men -- something that had long annoyed women -- gave them power. By cleverly chosing different kinds of underwear, even if it came from France or Italy, they could manipulate and control men's minds. The object of this manipulation: To get men to pay more orgasm-related attention to women.  You might want to read it all. Or maybe not. It is Safe For Work though, no pictures or pop-ups.

      What crap! Lori Hacking update. And her last name is starting to carry a little too much irony. The husband's still keeping himself stashed away at the U's psych unit while his story is unraveling faster every day. You can read about it  urlLink here  "We learned a lot of things in his life that are not true," Detective Dwayne Baird said Tuesday. "Medical school was the pinnacle of that deception."  I was wondering about the timeline when Lori had been last seen by someone, this report says she and her hubby were seen together Sunday evening, the night before hubby called in her disappearance.  Its also being reported by credible sources that Mark Hacking was sent home from his LDS mission early- a terrible disgrace for any Mormon missionary. (Currently the link won't open to get you a quote. Sorry.) Anyway, its being reported that maybe Mark had a little trouble keeping his paws off the pretty girls he converted while in Canada and was sent home reprimanded and disgraced.

      Its titled, "The Second Amendment- Underenforced, Misunderstood or Simply Ignored?" If you want to read it, say so and I will gladly share it, either via email or perhaps by posting it online. If nobody cares that's ok too.  The important bit was the instructor's comments.  She said:  I can unreservedly say that I've never had such a well researched essay on the 2nd Amendment. You certainly taught me a great deal.  Oh yeah, I scored 180 out of 200 possible points! That makes me very happy...

      and not in that Nemo "special fin," let's just call a gimp a gimp kind of way either!  I did NOT attend today's staff meeting. I should have attended because since I moved over to NG, I've only managed to make it to one meeting. But staff meetings overlap with my Algebra class and the last day of review was today and the final's over the next two days- so I skipped the meeting and went to class.  And I got a present from the meeting in spite of my absence! I'm a sucker for gadgets- hey, I am a guy after all, and I was offered my choice of either a NG labeled USB 4 way splitter, a USB memory plug or a credit card sized mult-tool with a compass, can & bottle opener, magnifying glass, tweezers and two screwdrivers! Oh, and a ruler on one side.  Guess which one I chose?  I had to have the multi-tool now didn't I? Its got a compass! If it had a lcd digital clock on the front it would be completely perfect. It will never pass an alert TSA scrutiny in a carry on bag due to the pointy steel opener but hey, its got tweezers. And a magnifying glass! It makes me want to run home and play in the yard and try to locate and fry some ants!  Yeah- gadgets!

      Well, its Terry’s fault really for putting pears and targets into the same sentence those two things reminded me of a story. I had to comment over there at Possumblog but its only fair that after dropping such a teaser, I tell the whole story.  The year is 1974, the place, my folk’s back yard in the center of the town of Alliance Ohio. I had just graduated high school. Its summer, its hot and the pear tree in the back yard has been dropping pears in the yard making a mess of things. The primary characters in this story, besides this scribe were my girlfriend, (who occasionally leaves comments around here as “BJ” and is usually referred to as the XSU), and at least 2 of my younger brothers. Tim and Mark were certainly there, I don’t recall if Pete was involved.  A little geography lesson is required in here someplace. Our house is an older place and bordered on one side by an alley that passed completely through the block. All of our parking was behind the house and off the alley and the alley from either direction was our driveway. At least we thought so. My brother Mark still owns and lives in that house BTW and it has kept him busy fixing and improving things.  Anyway, since this was 1974 and we did not yet have an internet connection or access to the World Wide Web, we knew nothing about PVC pipe potato cannons. We didn’t have any of those new-fangled electronic sparkers or multi-barreled rigs that came around with the advent of the internet. Instead, we had hand cannons! Ours were made from soda cans with the ends cut out and taped together end to end with our dad’s duct tape. (You knew duct tape was going to get into this story, didn’t you?) The can on the bottom didn’t get the ends removed, just a nail hole punched through the bottom and the normal zip tab hole in the top.  IMPORTANT SAFETY DISCLAIMER! These cannons were made from soda and beer cans back when they were still made from steel! Do not try this with aluminum soda cans! Serious injury might result. Just go drink a 6 pack of Slim-Fast, it still comes in suitable steel cans! Or experiment with PVC- its far superior.  Alright, that said, these cannons were normally about 4 or 5 or 6, 12 ounce cans tall. If you worked at it, you could carefully expand the rim of the top can big enough to load a tennis ball just to the depth of that first can. After that, with a splash of lighter fluid squirted in the bottom can through the nail hole and then evaporated through vigorous swinging of the whole contraption for a few seconds and a second person to strike the wooden kitchen match and hold it ever-so-carefully at the same draft hole, you could launch a tennis ball for two blocks!  Or the cannon would split apart at the tape seams.  Whatever the result, the entire process resulted in loud booms whenever the lighter fluid vaporized at the insistence of the match. Flames shooting out the top were pretty normal. It was possible to shoot a brightly colored green tennis ball straight up completely out of sight if you had a table to support your cannon vertically. And these fun little toys generate a bit of recoil, as you might imagine, so hanging on to one required some real determination.  Ok, you can probably see how these hand cannons were perfect toys for teenaged boys… Noise, flames, dangerous chemicals, things blowing up, what’s not to like?  So, there we were, the bunch of us, just hanging around the house on a quiet Sunday afternoon and complaining about the bees that were gathering over the rotting pears under the tree. “Hmm, are you thinking what I’m thinking?”  “Yeah! Go get a hand cannon!” While the pears did not fit as snugly as a tennis ball in the top of the can, they did make an ever so satisfying splat when they hit the street at the far end of the alley. In fact the pears made a fantastic juicy mess when they expired after a 60 yard flight! What fun! What terrific entertainment!  And our fun probably went on like that for 30 minutes or more. We all took turns holding the cannon and lighting and laughing and generally just relocating the mess in our yard into the street at the end of the alley.  Right up until the police cruiser turned up the alley… We grabbed our soda cans and everybody bailed into the basement through the stairs at the back of the house. “Maybe he won’t see us…” So I peaked out. The patrol car came half way up the alley, skidded to a stop and blocked our driveway access. “Hey! He’s got his gun pointed at our house! They both have their guns drawn!”  Hmm. Guess I ought to go out and see what the nice policemen want… Being the oldest, I headed out, trying to look sheepish, harmless and most of all, unarmed. “Can I help you officers?” Wow, look at that- both ends of the alley are blocked with patrol cars and there are serious looking policemen with shotguns pointed down our way.  “Show your hands! Show some ID!” Ok, I did that just as requested. “Where’s the shotgun?” “Shotgun, officer?” “Yes, the shotgun! We got a report that there were people shooting pears with a shotgun and the mess at the end of the street seems to support that call!”  Oh, so that’s what this is all about… “No sir, we don’t have any shotgun; that would be dangerous! Why, we’ve just been playing with these taped together soda cans…”   “Show me!” “Yes sir, you see we just squirt the lighter fluid in here, swing it around, hold the match…” “And that’s how the pears got in the street?” “Yes sir, do you want me to show you?”  “No! I want you to stop immediately with those cannons! No more in the city limits- none, nada, don’t you dare disrupt the peace and tranquility with those things again!”  And the six policemen put away their guns and three squad cars went away, leaving us to a quiet summer Sunday afternoon. Shooting the pears into a pond outside of town was never as much fun as it was that day in the back yard.

      Its not looking good for Lori Hacking- more than a week and no success at all in finding her. Even the authorities are saying that the searchers are probably looking for her body at this point.  The families are completely grief-stricken and have appointed a spokesperson and the cops aren't saying much at all about evidence in the case. There's details and pictures at  urlLink KSL TV.   The whole story reeks of "the husband did it," after hearing the evidence that has surfaced last week. So far, the "eye witness' that saw Lori at her car stretching has recanted, the hubby was out buying a new mattress first thing on a Monday morning and then called the police to report Lori missing in less time than it takes to drive from the mattress store to their apartment. The police have impounded a dumpster, searched and removed items from the house and perhaps found a bloody knife.  And of course the hubby's bizarre behaviour since Lori went missing doesn't help a bit.   So remember- you heard it here first. Its a Laci Peterson repeat and its going to be a sordid story when it all gets displayed in the light of day.

      As long as I'm still sittin here I might as well fill everyone in on some of last week's adventures. I mentioned that our elderly Dalmation, Abigail had surgery on her foot; she's getting better and going back to the vet tomorrow for new bandages and a checkup. She and Sandy were both exceptionally happy to be home after I picked them up on Tuesday morning.  Vacation went well really, about 3 days to short but better that than 3 days too long. The BSU and I headed out last Wednesday headed for the Oregon coast after an overnight stop in Baker City Oregon. The trip was uneventful and pleasant and when we arrived Thursday afternoon, Noah and Lily were waiting for us and most of the family were on scene as well.   So our camper went up and we got settled in. There was tons of food and communal meals at Mary's camper and all the BSU's 6 sisters showed up but one. So its a relaxed time of visiting, catching up, eating and some trip over the sand dune to the beach to wade in the waves. Definitely no swimming for this thin-skinned boy though! This is the Pacific Ocean, not the the Gulf of Mexico, so its much to cold for anything but walking in!  I took two brother-in-laws and son Noah out one afternoon and we found a logging road where we could shoot my guns that I had carefully stashed away and brought along. That was a pleasant diversion for one afternoon, the next day several of us went down to the  urlLink Tillamook Air Museum  for a visit. This museum is housed in the largest wooden structure inthe world and the building and its story are truly as interesting as the airplanes it houses. The best part was the basketball backstop and hoop that was installed over the door like it was put there to while away the hours shooting hoops- its 120 feet above the floor! We all had a good laugh over that!  Sunday we pulled out of the campground and headed for the BSU's hometown of St. Helens where we got a room and spent the evening doing laundry and visiting at sister mary's house. Lots more food, left over from the weekend!  Anyway, as usual, the BSU was not ready to head home to Utah after getting her toes stuck in the Oregon dirt, so I left her there when I returned on Monday. She said she wasn't staying a whole week but she hasn't called yet to say that she has a flight scheduled... So, at least I've less distraction from completing my schoolwork! I guess she will let me know when I'm to be at the airport and expecting her. And I hope she's not expecting me to clean house like I normally do in her absence...  The kids, Noah & Lily finished their road trip on Sunday night, safely back in Ogden. They left the beach on Saturday and spent the night at the half-way point to avoid pulling 14 hours straight on the road in that Tracker. The trucklet made quite a fine showing for itself overall, I'm very pleased that it took them so far safely and with only the problem of the loose drum bolts causing a problem and delay. That's pretty commenable for a 15 year old rig of undeterminate history before 3 years ago.  I think they had a pretty good time overall but Lily may never agree to sleep in a tent again. She's a girly-girl and really prefers the luxury of a mattress and running water, but she survived. They did do much more driving than realxing and playing on the beach but it was a good trip for them overall. And a little surprisingly, they are still talking to each other upon their return! Good for them.  That's it in a few paragraphs. When the research paper's done maybe there will be more details. 'Night.

      My paper is officially late as of tonight and its only in the roughest of states. Three pages and while not incoherent, its not good. I've actually located more source data than I can use and everytime I dig a little deeper, I'm chest deep in reading the Federalist Papers and trying to understand what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote and later ratified our Constitution.  That's right, I'm writing about the 2nd Amendment. I should be buying a paper from Kevin Baker over at the  urlLink Smallest Minority  or Oleg Volk at  urlLink A Human Right  or at the very least plagerizing their fine work but I'm trying to understand and develop my own paper. I've bitten off way more than I can manage! I'm also not trying to write this paper supporting one aspect of the 2nd Amendment over the other but rather I'm trying to show how throughout our history, the 2nd Amendment has been read and interpreted differently than the others, principally the 1st Amendment.  Its not possible to discuss this issue without talking about guns but I'm really trying to instead consider what our Founding Fathers meant when they wrote about "militia" and about "people." Then I want to compare the uses of those definitions as they are applied to other amendments.  Its interesting, and challenging but it is making me nuts! I'm just really having a hard time finding my voice in this paper. Anyway, its late and I hate that. The instructor will accept it through Saturday night without penalizing me so I will get it finished. I may not do much else until its done, but I will get it done!

      and here in Utah this time...  urlLink Missing woman's in-laws: Son lied about medical school  Police: 'Probably foul play involved'   The parents of a missing pregnant woman's husband told reporters Wednesday they had just learned that their son lied about being accepted to a medical school in North Carolina.  Mark Hacking has been questioned by police about his missing wife and authorities have impounded his car. He is not under arrest.  "Mark Hacking is in a safe place and we've been talking to him," said Salt Lake City Police Detective Kevin Joiner in a phone interview with CNN. Local news today reports that Hacking is under psychiatric care and it sounds like a suicide watch as well. But his story about going off to medical school is completely bogus. He apparently doesn't even have the Bachelor's degree that his inlaws had been told he received from the University of Utah!  Needless to say this is getting major attention from our local news agencies. Elizabeth Smart's family has jumped back into the news as well with offers of instruction to the family to help deal with the media. There's going to be much more to this story in the upcoming weeks.  There's more  urlLink here.

      Today there's this bit of wonderment from behind the Zion Curtain:  urlLink Library user cutting 'bad' words from popular book series  By Lori Buttars- The Salt Lake  Davis County library officials are facing a mystery that only Jessica Fletcher could solve.     It seems a library patron has been busy crossing out the "hells" and "damns" in books based on the the popular ''Murder, She Wrote'' TV series and changing them to "hecks" and "darns."     Layton library workers are at a loss as to what to do about the self-appointed censor who is blotting out the purple prose with a purple pen.  The best part is the librarian's plan to halt the offender-  "Our best hope is that this individual has a moment of revelation and desists."  Yeah, right.

      We're leaving as soon as I get the truck loaded up, the second dog dropped off at the vet, the firewood picked up, groceries bought and the BSU's sneakers come out of the dryer. What the heck is she doing that for? Might as well throw cinder blocks into that rotating drum!  So, lots to do before we pull out. We are on our way to the Oregon coast for the 3rd annual Sister's weekend camping trip. The BSU has 6 sisters and a plethora of hanger-on cousins and nieces so this camping weekend turns into a pretty big deal. We will be traveling as far as Nampa, Idaho tonight or maybe Baker, Oregon, spending the night and finishing the journey tomorrow.  We will be traveling back next Monday and in between we will be resting, eating, walking on the beach and generally catching up with familial gossip. I will be trying to to some Algebra as well.  The kid's are safely out at the beach having driven all the way up to Astoria, Oregon and are now apparently enjoying more beach and less driving. I'm anxious to hear the details when we catch up tomorrow afternoon.  And I will not be posting live from the beach, so you will have to catch up after I return. This will be a comletely analog weekend, no laptop, no digital camera and no wireless internet connection. So go visit the rest of the blogworld and check back next week!

      She's our elderly and beloved spotted dog. She had surgery yesterday to remove a torn toenail. We thought the vet was actually going to remove the entire toe but instead he simply removed the broken toe and part of the nail bed. She also had a number of skin tags removed from her eyelids, a tumor removed from the same foot as the injured toe and her teeth cleaned.  We stopped in to see her last night after her surgery and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She stayed there though since the vet will be boarding her and the other dog Sandy while we are away later this week. I made certain that her tag on her cage got marked for a bed-time Milk Bone because she really likes her Milk Bones.  Anyway, I hate it that she's not feeling very good right now.

      Its the Stevens Favorite 22 rifle that I mentioned in a previous   urlLink post.  Of course Bob the gun dealer called me while I was in the truck with the BSU to tell me of the arrival.  So I'm on the phone and I'm making plans to come by and pick it up and get the BCI check accomplished, and before 7PM when the BCI quits each day, and do I want to pick it up on Tuesday, all while the BSI is listening to just my side of the conversation.  "Who was that?"  "That was Bob, from work."  "Who's Bob? Why is he calling you?"  "He wants me to look at some things."  "What things?"  "Just some religious artifacts. He's a dealer in religious artifacts."  "WHAT?"  "He's a gun dealer. Its about guns. Leave it alone."  "YOU DON"T NEED ANY GUNS! YOU'RE GOING ON VACATION AND YOUR DOG'S JUST HAD SURGERY AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD ANY GUNS!"  Heh! I Didn't tell her it was already bought and paid for...

      You must go read   urlLink this!  Its absolutely hysterical. And, of course, I want to be a member. Its only proper since I live just a couple miles from St John's home and I've already visited the shrine of his honest-to-goodness, workshop which is almost directly west of me in the  urlLink Union-Pacific Station museum . Here's some highlights but go read the whole thing. And make sure to see the comments too! Thanks To Kevin at Smallest Minority for pointing me to it.  For, in the beginning, God did give a great gift upon Saint John Moses, and He said unto him: "Go, John Moses, and create what I have designed for you to create. Create Holy Artifacts for the just and righteous to carry by their side, so that they shall not fear wherever they roam for all the days of their lives."  I've gotta get me one of those artifacts just as soon as I can...

      Well they didn't call home last night and the phone call we made went directly to the voice mail- again... I'm pretty certain the phone itself is at fault.   Anyway, they spent the night in Eureka California, I know that because I'm watching their ATM activity! Eureka's at least 100 miles north of Ft Bragg, so apparently they got the wheel nut and lug problems fixed and got back on their way. Good for them.  They are nearly out of California and into Oregon. I hope they are finally starting to relax and anjoy the trip instead of stressing out over the details as they have been so far. Noah did say that they stopped and played in some tide pools a couple days ago so they must be having a little bit of fun along the way.

      and I agree with   urlLink Citizen Smash!  I hadn't really thought it though as well as he did but I think he is spot-on for his commentary. I didn't even see Spiderman I but I really liked this current movie. The BSU hated it, told me afterwards that she almost walked out to find something else in the cineplex to watch. But I really liked it. Its a great summer blockbuster movie and I think that Smash's commentary is terrific.  And so is the movie.

      The kids are in Ft Bragg California, though son Noah says he saw nothing passing through the first time that indicated there was an Army base there. They actually were further north but had to retreat to Ft Bragg as the Tracker has developed a problem.  Seems the nuts that hold the brake drum to the hub on one rear wheel have worked loose and they were in danger of losing the drum and wheel! Noah of course, as is his usual, called to say that the entire rear axle was about to fall out of the car, when it reality it is some loose and now damaged lug bolts and nuts.  This is especially aggravating because I just had that brake drum off the car last week! I did use the impact gun to run the nuts back on tight, though I admit I didn't come back along with a breaker bar to double check the torque on the nuts. For some reason, this Tracker has been harder on lug nuts and studs than any vehicle I have ever owned. I've replaced all the lug nuts at least once and most of the studs, either in the drums that secure the wheel or the hub to drum studs. (The parts are all the same.) Anyway, it has been a continual problem and it has resurfaced on this trip.  They actually had to creep back into town they were so concerned and Noah found a hotel room right across the street from one of the few auto repair shops in town. Hopefully he will find some competant assistance this morning and be back on their way soon.   Noah sounded pretty stressed when he called, he's sounded stressed from the first night when he called. I'm guessing that he is thinking that he bit off a little bigger trip than he expected. He suggested last night that Lily might be a fine Valium candidate right about now... Well, they wanted to be grownups and have an adventure so I guess this is working out just about right... Traveling is tough and finding your way on unknown roads and figuring out where to find a place to sleep and managing automobile breakdowns is all part of the adventure. I just hope they relax long enough to let the fun part soak in.  His dang cell phone continues to act up, working some times and burning up the minutes in huge chunks, then not working at all. I think it is actually the phone, which you might remember, I tried to save from the landfill by reusing. Now I'm catching hell from him and the BSU about cheaping out! Its a "dammed if I do, dammed if I don't" situation so there's nothing for me to do but ride it out.

      How in the hell did  urlLink this  happen?  But as the boat got closer and slowed down, she found it was a tiny, apricot-colored kitten. Nine inches long and screaming at the top of its lungs, the cat was paddling furiously.  The story mentions 40 other boats in the general vicinity of where the kitten now named Nemo was found. I hope the kitten in the water was an accident and not an act of cruelty.

      I got an "A!" Hah! The BSU bet me that it wouldn't be that good. And I showed her! The instructor was very pleased with the paper and my writing style. I didn't get all the punctuation in that she thought should be there and I forgot to list my sources on the works cited page alphabetically. Somebody out there should have called me on that!  Anyway, the instructor liked it and had good things to say about my ability to make a subject that she would normally have ignored interesting and readable. Now I just have to get to work on my 2nd Amendment paper...

      You can see it   urlLink here . All I know for certain is that they spent the first night in Wells, Nevada and the second night in Colfax, California. No idea where they are tonight.  No phone call yet tonight and the phone still goes directly to the voice mail when calling them from home. The BSU is most unhappy with the lack of phone calls to let her know they survived another day. I still think the cell phone battery has either failed or hasn't been charged, even though he assured me that he had the charger in the pile of wires that was part of the portable cd player pile.  What do ya bet he left the charger behind? And he hasn't figured out where to buy one yet?  UPDATE: He just called. On the cell phone. It seems to be working perfectly tonight. Anyway, they are staying the night in Bodega Bay, a little ways north of San Francisco. So far everything seems to be working ok though he did manage to heat up the Tracker's clutch while climbing some of the famous hills in San Francisco today. He reports high spirits and Lily's cooking skills improving!

       He's healthy!  At least he is cancer-free which was the big concern after he had lymph nodes removed last week. The first set of pathology results were inconclusive and the sampled cells were sent on to Johns-Hopkins hospital for review. Today he got the good news that he is apparently cancer free!  I'm very certain that a large cloud of concern has been lifted from their household and I'm reminded that prayer, properly applied, can be a very good thing. The XSU send her thanks to any or all of you that put her hubby & family on your prayer lists since last week.

      Just as soon as I get a few more free minutes I'm going to try to upload a picture of the map of the kid's route. I got started yesterday on this, it didn't go as smoothly as I expected and then I had to get back to the paying work.  I thought a route map with each day's stop might be fun to watch.

      No phone call last night from the kids, so the BSU called his cell phone. He answered and was just able to tell his mom that they had made it safely to California and were spending the night in some trendy little town. Then the connection died.   He didn't call back. And when the BSU tried to hit redial to call him back, she was directed straight into voicemail. Hmm, Technical difficulties. I of course caught unholy grief from the BSU for "cheaping out" on the cell service that I bought off the internet and not setting the boy up with reliable service.  But I figured it out. I'm willing to bet that he was carrying around a cell phone with a dead battery! I'm certain that he didn't have it plugged into any car chargers since at least Thursday. And I'm also certain that he didn't have it plugged in during yesterday's travels because he's using a portable cd player that uses the only power point in the car!  So of course it was my fault for not foreseeing the need and providing a power point duplexer so that he could listen to his music  and  charge his cell phone...

      At 1:45 this afternoon they finally pulled out of the driveway and headed out for their own version of the Great American Road Trip. As they pulled out they hesitated just for a moment and as they turned into the street son Noah flipped something out the open window, something red and looking like paper. Yup, a wrapper full of lit Black cat firecrackers to celebrate their kickoff went bang in the street! So off they go on a trip of 2300 miles and 12 days adventure.  They did dawdle about and overpack like crazy and I stood around and directed and duct-taped and double-checked the oil levels. They were planning on two Korean fleece blankets for the tent! King size ones! I did insist that one would be more than comfy in addition to the sleeping bags, pads and multiple pillows that went along.  Remember, they are traveling in a 1990 Geo Tracker. Its a little bitty trucklet. We did remove the back seat and the seat belts in the back to increase the storage capacity but its still plenty crowded in there. I insisted that there be an emergency tool kit packed, its in an ammo can. There's also a first aid kit, 2 quarts of oil, a gallon of coolant, a gallon of green tea, lots of food, a camp stove, a battery powered lantern and two bulging bags of clothes.  The food box has cereal and lots of canned stuffs, Beef-A-Roni and boxed rice and noodle dinners. Fresh stuff they can get along the way and no doubt they will be hitting some of America's finest fast food joints for some variety too.  The first night's stop was supposed to be Reno Nevada, but that ain't happening with such a late start. Its 556 miles to Reno, all the way across Utah and all the way across Nevada, so with a 2PM start and a 70 MPH speed limitation, its just not practical. Winnemucca maybe or Battle Mountain will be better stopping places for the night.  I did give them one must-see suggestion for the trip just before they pulled out. One of the places they want to see is San Francisco, so I told them they had to go to Haight-Asbury. These two think of themselves as hippies, its apropriate they go visit the birthplace of the hippy movement.  Lastly, they have strict instructons to call home every night so we know they are safe. I'm jealous...

      When last I wrote, you might remember, I was being spirited off by the BSU to resolve her hunger issue. I promised to be back to finis my weekend update, and, as my weekend has extended into today already, I guess I can continue the weekend update.  I'm not at work today. I was supposed to be but I called in this morning and took the day off. Or at least most of the day, I do have a phone conference at 1 that I really need to participate in so I'll try to get to work in time for that. In the mean time, already this morning I've met a guy and bought a Tracker motor from him, dropped the Tracker off at Les Schwab's Tire Store for an alignment, stopped by the insurance lady's office to add son Noah back onto my auto insurance policy, had breakfast at McDonalds and unloaded the motor out of my truck. Its 9:55 as I write this.  I've also got an Algebra mid-term test that is supposed to begin at 11:30 today, the Tracker won't be off the alignment rack until 11 and I still have to do some banking with Noah & Lily before they load up and depart on their "Around the Northwest in 15 Days" tour. So I'm just relaxing, can't you see?  The kids are heading out today as soon as they get loaded up. they plan to be in Reno tonight, San Francisco the next day and spend the remainder of a week cruisisng north up the Pacific Coast Highway. They've got a new tent, new stove and lantern and enough groceries to last weeks if they get stuck going over Donner Pass. They also have a cell phone and enough money so that they won't be resorting to eating berries off bushes beside the road and brushing their teeth with bent sticks. They have maps and driving directions and an ATM card so they don't need to carry very much cash.  This does promise to be an exciting trip for the two of them. It willbe interesting to see if they are speaking when they get back! We will be meeting them a week from Thursday in  urlLink Nehelem State Park  in Oregon as we join up for the spouse's family weekend campout and get-together. It should be fun as always though the BSU is having fits about her sisters not approving of Noah & Lily's shared sleeping arrangements. Oh well!  BTW, the engine that I bought- $255 off of  urlLink EBay  and the seller lived just 70 miles away but had to pass through Ogden this morning and offered to bring it along and drop it off. So Noah and I met him at the truck stop and in 5 minutes time I was the happy owner of a spare Tracker motor. You might remember that I searched all the used engine providers in a 70 mile radius just a few weeks ago. The best price I could find was $850 for the same engine I just bought for $260. That's a much better price in my book! The guy selling really did goof I think by running his auction over the holiday weekend and ending it mid-day on the 5th. There was at least one other guy bidding on it but probably not very many others. And I sniped it like a bandit, holding off on my bid until just 20 seconds remained before closing! The bid jumped from $205 to $255 in those closing seconds and it ended up with my bid being the winning bid! Hah!  So, I gotta run. Guess I need to email my Algebra prof and tell him I'll be late or absent for today's portion of the test. Then its off to get the tracker off the alignment rack, finish the banking and kick these two kids down the road on their big adventure. More later. Maybe...

      I'm tired, can I go back to work now?  Its been kinda like that athough not totally incapacitating. Son Noah and I did finish the transmission replacement on Lily's car on Friday evening. Everything's good with it except that it needs an alignment to get the front wheels pointing the same direction and the steering wheel turned into its normal position. The alignment is scheduled for tomorrow.  And the Tracker has to go into the alignment bay right after Lily's Subaru since we replaced the shocks and struts on that car on Saturday afternoon. But not until after Noah and I went to the in the morning urlLink Cashe Valley Cruise-In.   This is the largest car show in the state and it really is a must-see if you like automobiles of nearly any flavor. Not too many brass lamped antiques but lots of hot rods and muscle cars and customs and trucks and imports. The fairgrounds gets packed and its hot but boy oh boy its a car show to see. We went early, so we left early and when we stopped down the road a couple miles for sodas I was able to give away my still not cashed in entries for the 57 Belair that was being given away. Another customer stopped in to inquire about directions and I was able to not only point him in the right direction but to pay his way and his partner's into the show. Good karma I supose.  What else? I mowed the yard on Saturday too and cleaned out two flower beds on Sunday. One of them needed some dead rose bushes removed and the ground cover succulent that was threatening to take over my yard thinned out.   Sunday afternoon was a matinee of The Terminal with the BSU and the boy and the ever (still) present Lily. The movie was very enjoyable thought the love interest bit with Catherine Zeta-Jones didn't really work very well. It just fell flat and that might have actually been the point but I thought it was the only part of the movie that didn't work for me.  NOTE: The BSU just walked up and announced that it was time for me to take her to dinner. Did I know we were going to dinnner? Nope. So more later.

      Over at  urlLink Sgt Stryker's Daily Briefing.  This is a remarkable commentary about Texas stereotypes, immigrants to America and attitudes from "Old Europe." I especially like this comment about those that look down their nose at the immigrants to this country.  Their children and grandchildren have been and continue to be elected to office, invent the next big thing, write the literary sensation, make the next scientific breakthrough, command an army. That flaccid pink thing those descendents of political and economic migrants are handing to you? That would be your ass, and no need to thank us, the pleasure was all ours.  Go read the whole thing and compare it to this  urlLink Michael Savage  article that presumably is also about immigration.  I just had to read "Daisy Chain Immigration Destroys America" as a writing class assignment and write a critical review. The title of my review is "Who Publishes This Guy? And Why?   Did I mention it was a  critical  review I was supposed to write? I had a ball writing this paper! What an awful load of dreck this guy writes. My final paragraph is:  If I were Mr. Savage's long forgotten 10th grade English teacher, I would give this paper back to him with a big red F on it and expect him to fix it. As his editor, I would be calling Human Resourses to fire up the interview process for look for his replacement. And as a reader or listener, I would toss this article in the trash as litter with no further thought to his arguement because his sloppy work completely overshadowed his message.  And then I would hire Sgt. Mom for her intelligent, witty and thought provoking commentary to replace him.

      I've been PowerPointing non-stop on the job since Tuesday, now I'm cranking up to kill several trees by running them through the printer and copy machines to make handouts. I've also got to make artwork for the handouts and the table name tags and then start hole-punching all the copies piling up on the table.  And it all has to be done before Monday. Cohort Matt and I have been hard at this, calling and collecting briefings from the slow and slacker crowd that always neglects their deadlines. We are printing 15 copies each of 28 different briefings, of which we both had to prepare two each.  Monday is setup and Tuesday and Wednesday will be a medium sized conference that we are hosting, giving briefings, running the computer, taking notes and in my case, pitching a request for money to complete one of my programs.  I need $10 million to buy parts and pay for installation of an improved taxi light on 600+ F16s. The one they have now is bad, very bad. It was always bad from the beginning but other modifications have hung a large pod in front of the light making it pretty much useless for taxiing. With an agreement from the commands that own the jets I can press on with providing a relocated to the front of the airplane taxi light that  really  lights stuff up!  I actually think they might pay...

      This article claims that John F'n Kerry has television ads proclaiming him to be a  urlLink hunter.  Not to put too fine a point on it but the photo I see is of the senator at a trap range, not hunting. I also read that JFK claimed to love deer hunting by "crawling on his belly through the woods with his shotgun..." Crawling on his belly? Oh please...  Come on- if JFK ever hunted deer by crawling on his belly, he had a camera operator there to film it for his archives. Where's the film? The campaign is running television commercials that show Kerry hunting. It is also distributing campaign literature touting Kerry’s support of the Second Amendment.  This public-relations effort has infuriated the National Rifle Association (NRA).  “He’s not a hunter; he’s just playing one on TV,” said Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist. “The guy has voted consistently against gun owners. It’s politics at its worst.” And he took time out of his busy campaign schedule to vote for the Assault Weapons Ban extension few weeks back.

      Oh wait! He says he will be there urlLink "when neccesary."  Kerry said Bush should immediately call a special session of Congress to implement the recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission, and he said he would interrupt his campaigning to be there for debate and voting "when necessary."  "When we are at war, we need to do the things that make us safe rapidly, immediately," Kerry said. "If there is something that will make America safer, it should be done now, not tomorrow." First of all, John F'n Kerry gets my back up just because, unlike Bob Dole, he hasn't had the decency to retire his Senate seat to run for president. Its wrong to be holding public office and to be absent from that duty for months at a time while off doing what you think is more important.  So I have no belief that should President Bush call Congress to a special session that Senator Kerry would be there for anything except a grandstanding speech and the voting, should there be any. He made that pretty clear I think.  Secondly, on this subject of the president implementing these changes to the intelligence world that he recommended today, what would have been John F'n Kerry's words if these ideas had been implemented two years ago? Maybe that the president was rushing into changes that weren't warranted and had not been properly researched? That proper consideration wasn't being applied to this big issue? Yeah, I think so. There is no way that any action taken by President Bush would not have been immediately condemmed, no matter what the action was.  Even the BSU, who supports JFK, said yesterday that his condecending attitude poured through when he was talking to middle-class folks and claiming to represent them. Even she could see that his words just don't ring true.  And I am  sick to death  of hearing him brag about his 4 months and 3 cuts from Vietnam! The man's no hero dammit! He was a cry-baby that claimed Purple Hearts for Band-Aid covered scratches that by some reports he caused himself, he had time to film himself in homemade recreations of battles and he bailed out instead of doing his time. Then he made it worse by defiling the duty and lives of all servicemen when he bragged to Congress how he had committed atrocities or seen them.  The man's a liar, a flip-flopper and does NOT represent me! Nor will he ever if I can encourage you not to vote for him in November.  Later we'll discuss his plan to hire 200,000 new military members...

      No longer just a "person of interest," now he's a  urlLink suspect  and has been arrested and put in jail. Good! Not too surprising really. Police said that 50 minutes before Hacking called police, he telephoned friends to say his wife was missing. During that time, he went out and bought a queen-sized mattress without a box spring. Now perhaps Lori's body can be located and she can be laid to rest properly.  Did I mention I've met this guy? He was working at the same hospital where he has been a patient for the past two weeks and that's the same hospital where the BSU was a patient 2 years ago. I remember him being the orderly that helped get her checked in when she transfered from the hospital in Ogden.  The  other  creepy thing about this character is that his actions could easily those of the BSU's first hubby. Many of Mark's circumstances are eerily similar and the BSU could easily ended up in Lori's predicament if she hadn't left him when she did. The sub-standard performance, particularly in relation to his siblings, the lying about plans and goals, the devotion to the LDS belief system were all aspects of her first hubby that made him a scary character.  He broke into her apartment one weekend, after I moved in, loaded one of my handguns and waited for us to return on a Sunday night. Luckily, we didn't return until Monday. When the break-in and the loaded weapon and missing photographs were discovered, we had him arrested. And I carried that same gun daily for a few weeks until he moved away...  Anyway, I got distracted. Sorry. I'm just glad that Mark Hacking is on his way to a long time in lock-up somewhere.

      Well then, school’s out for three weeks. Not quite Alice Cooper’s, “School’s Out Forever,” but three weeks will be a decent break. Maybe I’ll even be able to crank up my posting quality because I realize that things have been pretty terrible lately in that regard. I did warn you about it some months ago…  So the weekend was as relaxing as I could make it. Friday involved a trip to Salt Lake for a Doc visit for the spouse and we took the opportunity to visit the  urlLink Titanic artifacts display  at the ZCMI shopping center. It was an interesting display and I admit the Titanic story is a fascinating one, but I was underwhelmed by the quantity of artifacts in the display. It was nice and all, it just didn’t have an abundance of things to look at. Somehow, I guessed there would be more things to see.  Something I did not know about the Titanic- it required one pound of coal to move one foot! The White Lines management was so concerned that the coal supply not run low on the ship’s maiden voyage that the coal was stacked up in the crew’s dining room!  So, I didn’t intend this post be all about boat but about the weekend. So where was I? Baseball- I went to a  urlLink Raptor’s  baseball game Friday night for another bit of relaxation with America’s game. I’ve actually been to Lindquist Field three times this summer and haven’t taken the time to write about the pleasure I get from going to a ball game.  So Friday night was another night of watching baseball and it was a grand time. And the Raptors won, 13-10.  The rest of the weekend was spent in the yard with just a trip to the grocery store for the twice-monthly restocking of vittles. The shop got cleaned up, though that job’s not finished, the front yard received another dose of Turf Builder to get it greened up, the back yard got watered thoroughly and I finally got the guns cleaned that were used during the Oregon vacation.  Oh, I added a rear sight to my Kel-Tec P3AT too. The gun is designed with two small painted dots inset into the top of the slide and they are just barely adequate for the gun’s intended use. But one of the guys on the  urlLink Kel-Tec Range  developed a proper  urlLink rear sight  to improve the sight picture and the disparity between the point of aim and the point of impact and I decided I had to have one for my gun. The sight is a tiny bit of plastic that glues into the machined slot already in the slide. It seems to be a really well made piece and the instructions are first rate making installation simple. I’ve not yet shot the gun with its new sight but since I didn’t go shooting over the weekend, a trip to the range might be in order this week.  No links right now for all this good stuff I’ve put in this post but I will correct that this evening. Work is busy this week and the network connection has been poor. I’m also back to making PowerPoint charts for a couple briefings next week. So posting at work will be limited and I’ll do better from the homestead.

      Mark Hacking has apparently been talking, just enough that the family of Lori Hacking disclosed to the media that there is no further need to  urlLink search . Police focused on Mark Hacking early in the investigation and have uncovered a life full of lies. He never graduated from the University of Utah in psychology and never applied to medical school as his family believed. Mark and Lori Hacking were just days   away from moving to North Carolina; he had told family he has been accepted to the medical school at Chapel Hill.     And the morning he said his wife disappeared, Mark Hacking told police he had run his wife's normal three-mile jogging route twice. Actually, he was at a South Salt Lake furniture store, buying a new mattress. Police seized a mattress from a Dumpster behind a church. They also recovered a small amount of blood, a knife and a box spring, along with bags of other evidence, from the Hackings' apartment. That evidence is now at the state crime lab undergoing analysis.  Maybe shortly he will no longer be "a person of interest," but a real, no-kidding suspect! We can hope.
