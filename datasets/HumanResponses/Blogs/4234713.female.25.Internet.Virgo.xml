       Dido - See the Sun      "...   And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day   But I promise you you'll see the sun again   And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness   And I promise you you'll see the sun again   ..."         At least I try to remind myself of this... although i "temporarily forgot there's better day's to come"         But it's so hard.        R, you are hurting me.    :`(

        well, it's late as usual, and I'm just popping by to say 'night to all. I spent a few hours tonight chatting with Jason (aka J) a new internet friend who's pretty neet and lives on a farm near Williamsport.      special thanks to J for keeping me occupied during the typically lonely hours of the evening...      more later this weekend.       Today's link is Sony - thank you for having underpaid Chinese people manufacture my new portable car CD player.... It's very nice and much better quality than the really cheap one I returned to Best Buy that was also from China, ironically.      nite

       Thank goodness for music and cats...      otherwise, life would simply be far to cruel and harsh to survive.

       So... work, um, I don't even know what I did all day. I worked all day, can't recall much of it this late in the day, so I suppose it wasn't ground breaking.      After work today, I went with a co-worker, Petra, to Best Buy to pick up a new PC tower with her (for her). She had an ancient PC that was in a store somewhere and had been reconditioned. It was so not working. I tried to mess around with it the other night, but I couldn't get it to recognize the modem anymore. She recently won a lawsuit of sorts and had a little extra cash, so I suggested she get a basic model from somewhere - so, off to Best Buy for a $449 eMachine with tax and a $50 rebate. Not a bad deal. Good memory and all, a DVD/CD-RW, plus Win XP and new periphials.. it's amazing how cheap technology is now adays... I purchased a PC with half the computing power and wizardry for 3 to 4 times as much! I did pick up a CD player for the car, kind of a discount brand - not sure if I like it, but what do you expect for $30.      Sigh - - I'm getting old. Speaking of which, the big bad b-day is lurking around the corner. :( I will now be officially over a quarter of a century old.  I know it's totally hokey to be concerned about my age, and yet, I had hopes to have gotten somewhere further in my life by now, or at least be well on my way to my goals before I get middle aged and fat and wrinkly...  Before I know it,  I will be in my 30's ...  my life half over.  SO depressing that we spend so much time trying to get ahead in our youth instead of enjoying it while our bodies are able.      Cat's are good, of course. They are wrestling about and making a mess. Colleen got back to me with a rough draft of a logo for the CafePress store - looks very promising.      Made the mistake of emailing my mom today attempting to explain how her negative remarks are offensive and well, she did her thing, and somehow misinterpreted and turned the whole thing into me supposedly having a guilt trip for not talking to her. ? How? I don't know.      Love life isn't improving. Men are stupid. R won't come to his senses, so I guess I will be working on getting over him as unreal as that feels and seems to me. It really sucks, all the nice part of falling in love and thinking that you've found a real companion and person you can count on, and then you find out you were mistaken in one way or another - circumstances... Makes one feel lonelier I think, as if you were trying to acecpt being alone and accept your life and then you meet a companion and become so accustomed to them that they factor into your every day plans and future dreams, then poof - you are alone again and thinking of what they are doing without you and feeling unloved and abandoned and frankly, miserable.      The older ex, G, is still lost in his own personal mental battle and inner demons and barely capably of coping with his situation. I begin to wonder if he'll ever be ok. I think he has many years ahead of him of recovery. So, no happy get together there. It's hard to care about someone in one way, and yet harbor resentment, anger, and borderline hatred simultaneously. My good days are the ones I can forget he is even around and not think of the past. I don't understand so many things about how he sees life and how he deals with things.         Good night all :

       I just finished watching Charlie Rose on WVIA - a PBS station, and I have to say that every time I see or read about Lance Armstrong, I'm impressed, amazed, and a little inspired. He is one of the few athletes who is truly worthy of being considered a role model and a real 'star' quality person.       His deeds and integrity far outshine the glossy hype of other US so called sports stars who are frequently on a pedestal one day, in court for rape charges or drug abuse the next, who wallpaper their lives with glitz and glamour instead of remaining true to themselves and real.        This man fought back cancer, has survived a divorce, and still went on to win 6 consecutive Tour de France races with great integrity, will-power, and this year, with Sheryl Crow at his side.      He is living proof that you  can do it  no matter what the obstacles are - he faced death itself, man's greatest fear, and won. He faced the greatest cycling challenge, and won. He's faced personal and emotional challenges, and succeeded.      The transcripts for the interview will be up in a day or so at   urlLink  http://www.charlierose.com/index.shtm       My personal salute to Lance !

       It seems there are a curious number of blogs popping up.   ?         Hmmmm?      Boy. Well, I'll say this for ye all - I hope we all keep them up so that we have interesting reading materials when we go to 'visit'.      peace out      xo       R - I'm mad at you still :(   G - I'm mad at you too :(      sigh... life is full of such disappointment that my heart feels heavy nearly every day.

       Hello,   Today is a new day I suppose, and as with each morning, my first dilemma after rousing my sleepy head is a trivial one, what to wear? If we had uniforms for work, I think women would spend much less time getting ready. The next dilemma is WHAT do I do today at work to get ahead?    Bowie is back! I picked him up after work yesterday, and he seemed a wee bit sore (by the way he was walking) and immediately sniffed the entire house as if to ensure he was really back, or to make sure I hadn't changed anything while he was gone. Soon he and Chloe were tumbling about, so I guess he's ok. :) AND my vet bill was much lower than I feared it might be. Always a good thing. Because of their age (5 months), they received one year vaccines instead of the kitten ones that you have to update every couple of months, so that is another bonus. The vet recommends another worming to be on the safe side, and Chloe has an appt for the end of September to be spayed. I spoke briefly with one of the assistants about the risk of Pookie being an FIP carrier and introducing it, and they said it is possible and that I'll just have to see. Cross your paws!   Hmmmm. Guess that's all for now. Oh wait, no, it's not.  I released Version 4 of my website last night with updated pictures, a few new pages, the Krispin family album, and a link to what I hope will be a new web store with CafePress.com (You woudn't believe the lengths I had to go to to trick Trellix into letting me, including copying my site, unpublishing it, and republishing it under a slightly new URL - don't worry, the main one didn't change).  I'll be attempting to concetrate on taking new photos over the next couple of weeks (both cats and other) and creating custom products for the store.  IF I can generate at least $10 a month, it will cover the $6 fee to upgrade the store and be worth it.      L8R (she says to her invisible audience)

       Well, it's not even noon, and it's a day of new lows for the year. My scale told me I popped over 120lbs this morning - I deserve it, I've been stuffing food into me for weeks as a ineffective means of consoling myself for recent romantic failure. I knew it was going to happen, but did it anyway, and now, I'm at a place I haven't been in gosh, 2 years?      What else?      You know, I swore I wouldn't cry! But I did. "L". There's something horribly wrong with me because every time I have a one on one sit down with my boss, I usually end up crying.       So, typical discussion topics - work on my attitude, be more positive, find a way to put on an semblance of an extrovert persona, and step up and find a way to do more, or I'm not going to succeed (however, I am fulfilling my job description in an administrative role just fine). Somehow, none of this seems fair to me and leads me to think that perhaps I should start trying to find a career where being an introvert is an asset and I can succeed in 40 hours a week instead of busting my ass to get somewhere when I have no guarantee of getting anywhere or strong desire to get where it is I am supposed to be going.      So, anyone have any ideas on how to take a crappy $2 Million a year in sales website ( urlLink www.driverfx.com ) that functions as an affiliate program (other people, our customers, are supposed to drive traffic and sales, but aren't) and turn it into a success (on a tightwad budget that would impress scrooge himself)?       What the hell is the correct solution and how am I supposed to find it and what the hell am I doing here?      :`(

        Well, once again, attempting to post some updates to the site, and having difficulties with the Verizon interface of Trellix site builder.       sigh.      Well, there are worse things in life. Believe me, I know. One of them is love.      So, I chose not to face the world today and called off sick from work. The kitties had an appt in the afternoon that I had to leave early for anyway. (by the way, Bowie is overnighting at the vet for surgery in the morning!) I now have a mocked up 'performance review' tomorrow. Needless to say, no one else is having performance reviews. However, I'm getting tired of being ignored and overwhelmed, so I'm not sure what I will say tomorrow. There are issues... I can't go into too much detail being that this is an open blog, but there is a bad case of favoritism going on (I have proof) and I have not been receiving the support and guidance I should have to do my job. So, will I sit mutely and nod my head, or find my inner spirit to speak up?        (I just noticed this has spell check - doh!)      Perhaps I will be filing for unemployment soon? Somehow it doesn't seem so bad. I'd rather deal with real problems than face my emotional and mental maelstrom.      Take a moment for Bowie to wish him well... He should be back tomorrow nite. I miss the little booger. There is no one here to rile up Chloe.      'night all  (if there is indeed anyone out there)

       Blogity blog blog blog...  Hey! Wow - what an exciting day... Picked up 28lb tote of cat litter at the store, new kitten food for two finicky eaters, tons of fun cat toys and treat, and a little something for the bunny too. Hooked up Colleen's scanner and have been scanning in tons of old photos (and new) - I'm so excited! Also sent Colleen on a walk around the house to take web 'acceptable' photos so I can show everyone what the house looks like now - AND I slipped in some shots of this neet bug that lives in her strawberries, a Katydid. (Check out this bug website -   urlLink  http://www.BugGuide.net   ) They are classified as Arthropods » Hexapods » Insects » Grasshoppers, Katydids and Crickets. Speaking of which, Alex is at Francis Slocum today helping teach other kids about bugs and showing off his bug collection that he made this summer! They brought the Katydid along as show-n-tell. SO, hopefull there will be tons of new photos later in the week.  Please let me know if areas of the site are consistently now working for you. I tried to access it from Colleen's with dial up and it was awful! :( Some pages kept giving me a strange locked out error!       L8R Gator!

       Dear Diary - why does my older cat want to eat the kitten food, and my kittens want to eat the grown-up food?

       Yeah!  Finally, finally, Trellix wised up and allowed me to publish my site changes.  Of course, that was only after I spent 30 minutes pouring over ever help page and help link on Verizon's site trying to figure out who might be the correct number to call for help and debating pulling off about an hours worth of work on the About Me page where I've linked to streaming audio clips from Amazon that will play with Real Player.   However, it's up - so enjoy the fabulous journey and learn something new.  Of course, it's STILL not finished, but my right hand is starting to ache from all the typing and copying.     Things left are:      more detailed bio    Picture of Sandy    Family pictures i will try to scan today (new page?    pictures of the Krispin house (new page?)    find different whiteboard/message board (what's your opinion?)    possibly post lyrics page with some of the ones i have on disk     For now, i'm finding some coffee and a bite, then heading to Pet Supplies Plus for cat litter and toys with the Krispins.          peace     out
