YES FFS...", oK therses a rude boy and this boy is being  A COMPLETE JACKASS  SO i planned this and it took sevreral minuets to come up with the idea of kidnapping a  jackass  and putting him in a box and sending the  jackass  some where like India but the cost 2 fligh the person there would cost alot i think, once hes on the plane well cut a hole in the box and poke the jackass  hard! ! ! ! and pay the pilot  to land roughly so the  jackass  will be hurt, once he arrives welll greet him with open arms, if you get what i mean people !!! :)  1. what do you thing 2.any improvements ? 3.how much would it cost 2 send sum1 to india 4.who else wants to poke the  jackass  ?              let me kno plzzz

Well i was out in my gardens last night and i saw something at the bottom of it.. then i saw a badger ! i nearly screamed but i didnt THANK GOD.... it was  a badger... and then i thought dont badgers live where hill lives... so today i named the badger HILL for some wierd reason.. so the badger is called Hill dont get confused here people ! ! So HILL was searching for food so i ran inside and got some cat food and putit on a plate and gave it to the badger..   so hill was eating the cat foood and i was watching and  then i got my cat and put it near the badger  BAD FUCKING IDEA  cus it nearly ate my cat it did honestly it ran at my cat.. i nealry screamed ohh i swear DONT PUT YOUR CATS NEAR BADGERS !   Clares  website seems to be more popular than mine... but i think shes pretending to be people on it ! if ya kno wht i mean.. she might sew me for saying that but i DONT CARE.... well i do ill be poor   PEACE OUT.. and god bless
