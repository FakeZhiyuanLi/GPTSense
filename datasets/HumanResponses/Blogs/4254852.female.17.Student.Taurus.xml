      I don't care if the "Time and Time Again" video somewhat promotes anti-war. I like the video because it's different and of course, the band is amazing. TODAY WE LEAVE FOR WARPED TOUR IN COLUMBUS! YEEEHAWWW  ANywho, Josh is leaving Sunday! Ahh, I'm gonna miss him so much! School starts back up on Thursday, so we're gonna hang out Saturday after work. I told him I really wanna see Little Black Book, but he was all "that's a chick flick so no, blah blah". I don't want to waste $8 on something I don't want to see though, so I guess we can find something else to do.  Megan wants to know if I can drop her backpack off at her house. Um, yeah when I get my $25. Then maybe I'll throw her ratty clothes in there too. I'm sick of people using me & walking all over me because I let them. It sucks and I'm through with it! So, that's why I have edited my priority list to the following: 1. School/college app's/SAT-related stuff 2. Student Gov't 3. NHS 4. Work 5. ROCKING THE FUCK OUT @ WARPED TOUR '04 BABY! 6. More school shopping and shopping in general because it's my addiction 7. Being a better friend to those who matter to me 8. Finish my set of White Strips, another tanning bed visit before Thursday, and keeping up my tennis workouts for conditioning 9. Making my car beautiful again with a wash, buff, and wax, all courtesy of Dusty, AFTER my rims arrive 10. Finish downloading these songs and making all my mix cd's 11. OH SHITE! I forgot I have to make a phone tree for Student Govt by Thursday too 12. Oh yeah, and I have AP usgovt homework, although it isnt due until Sept. 3 or something, it'd be nice to finish it WAY ahead 13. Read all those damn books i checked out before they are due 14. Take the movie back to Blockbuster before we leave tomorrow 15. Figuring out how to get scholarships/financial aid/work study/etc in college 16. Figuring out where I REALLY want to go & if they have early decision 17-99. Stuff I can't think of but is more than likely important in some way 100. Guys  Anyways, hopefully we can sneck in my vid. camera for the concert and get some good footage and take pictures. If not, that will suck, but there's nothin I can do! Donnie has a cam. phone though so it's all good. Me, Donnie, Stillwell, Jonathan, Chodes, Cassie, & Randi Gail...prepped for the BEST CONCERT OF THE SUMMER!
