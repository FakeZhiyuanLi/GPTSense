						   ......"You're a vegetable, you're a vegetable / Still they hate you, you're a vegetable / You're just a buffet, you're a vegetable / They eat off of you, you're a vegetable..."???????  It's really just a random though. Which is why it's kinda cool to have a blog..cause I can just post this type of random shit as it comes to me. Fuckin cool!

						   The hotel in which i work is by no means a road-side Holiday Inn. It is very bougie. So that means our cliente are mostly 'well to do' types. Basically to make a long story as short as possible. I get sooooo pissed off that these guests repeatedly bring me $20 bills (or higher) to constantly make change! And while I'm sure that a good part of my pissed-offness is becuz I'm pretty broke,  but still it pisses me off to no end to have to constantly make change for  these yuppy -upitty fucks!

						   Right now I am on avery limited budget. There was like barely ANY food in the frig. I get paid on 8/20, but I need to eat tween now and then, right? So I figure I'd go to the grocery store and get a couple of things that will last for about a week and get me by until I can buy more. Makes sense, right? So I essentially go buy, some turkey bologna, mayo, bread, cereal and milk. When I get home and start putting these items away, I kinda took a step back and realized I am turning to Theo from that one episode of The Cosby Show. You remember it was the very first epiode and Cliff and Clair were concerned with Theo's lackluster grades? Cliff went to to talk to him, and he expressed that he didnt need to do exceptionally well in High School b/c he wasnt going to college. He was gonna get a 'regular' job. Then Cliff pulled out the Monopoly (Which I gotta buy. I havent played in sooooooo long.)money, and started breaking down people's real life expenses. And at the end, Theo thought he had it all figured out and Cliff was like "There is a problem! You havent eaten yet!", then snatched the last couple of bills from Theo's hand. And Theo snatched back a bill and said........"I CAN GET BY ON BOLOGNA AND CEREAL!" Remember that? LOL. Well goddamn if that aint my grown ass!

						   Fuck street gangs and the such....NOTHING scares me more than a group of drunk ass white boys! Them fuckers are liable to do ANYTHING. And then the thing is.....they be pissy drunk off of 2 budweisers! I never understood that shit. White people in general scare me,  and when you get to multiplying them and adding the element of drunkness,  it's a wrap!  And if you read this...and you happen to be white, please dont be offended. But you gotta know that you guys are scary!

						   You know Dilated Peoples' song 'This Way' featuring Kanye West? There's a part in the song where it says "I know there's things in my life that I'ma let go starting tonight"? That lyric has been replaying in my head like the last 3 days or so. I think Im gonna steal some print paper from work and write it in marker and and put it on my bedroom wall. Yet another random thought!

						   ...well sorta! I didnt think my sweetie was checking this thing, but apparently she is. B/C she told me that my ass needs to do a new blog. Hehehehe. Anyways I dont know if I have much to blog about at the moment. Just have a couple of random thoughts floating thru my head. I suppose I'll share. For one...Prince's song " Gett Off" is stuck in my head. How is that for random? Anyways....I was at home last night watching VH1-Soul channel like I frequently do (right KK? LOL) when India. Arie's "Ready For Love" came on. It got me to thinking of how when that song first came out I was SOOOOOOO feeling it. Like really deep down in my biz-ones, ya know? And the part where she says 'they say watch what you wish for, cause you may receive'. And that shit really happened to me. I wished for a love, and dammit I got it. But what I'm realizing is that once I got it, I maintained it for a minute, but I got unfocused. I dont wanna say that I took it for granted cause I try not to take anyone for granted, but I will admit to getting unfocused. So upon hearing the song and having that thought.....THE IDEA/INSPIRATION FOR A NEW POEM came to me. You dont understand....I just havent found the inspiration to write shit resembling a poem in sooooooo long. But it came to me. I think it's gonna be called "My Apologies To My Love (Songs). Basically Im gonna be apologizing to my love and some of my favorite love songs using the titles of some of my favorite songs about love. Get it? If not, I may find the courage to post it. We'll see.

						   I went to this outdoor jazz festival with a couple friends today. And you know damn near ANY outdoor fest that black people are a part of, they will have a bunch of vendors out there selling shit. There was this one brother from Oklahoma City that had a booth set up. He had all sorts of ol' skool posters and nic nacs and shit. I saw the booth from about 30 yards away and I knew if I went over there I was gonna be some shit. I very well could be a complusive spender. So anyways I felt like Pookie when the crack was calling him .Cause that booth was YELLING for my ass to come over. And went over I did. As soon as I got there I knew what I was gonna buy. They were on display. It was blow up covers of Ebony and Life magazines. The Ebony cover had ALL of the Jacksons. I'm talking everyone from Joe, to Michael, to a baby Janet to Rebbie!!! It was from 1974 I think. Everyone had afros. Jermaine's 'fro was permed out. It's the new hotness I swear!!! Then the other one....WHEW!!!! The other is a Life magazine cover of Dorothy Dandridge from 1954!!! My mama was like 8 months old when that cover came out. I mean it's Dorothy dammit. What more do I have to say? 2 for $20?????? It had to go down. I damn sure didnt REALLY need to come off that $20, but I really wanted to. And sometimes when it's not life threatening you gotta allow yourself a want every now and again. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!!

						   Or at least I wanted to.  So what happened was....I left out of the house like 45 minutes later than I normally do. So I get on the bus at 10:05 for what normally is a 18 minute ride. And I have to be at work at 10:30. You follow along? See how close I was cutting it? Why did the bus driver STOP at the the damn terminal and start chatting it up with one of his colleagues? At first the light was red when he stopped. So I was thinking...'Oh this BETTA be a mighty short catch up session'. But of course it wasnt. Then the light turned green. AND THAT FUCKAH  DID NOT  CLOSE THE DOOR AND CONTINUE HIS ROUTE. Instead what he did was continue chucking it up with his co-worker. I'm looking at him like' Son! If you dont get this damn bus to vroom vroom-ing!' So of course cause I'm pushing it for work, a couple of minutes seem like an eternity. And it's not like he let the light turn back red or anything. But I just wasnt in the mood for chancing it, ya know? They are exchanging pleasantries and shit. And I'm thinking 'Would it be wrong for me to get up, and pull the little lever to close the door and then he'll get the hint.' The whole thing prolly took no more than 2 minutes, but I swear my impending lateness made it feel more like 20.

						   So KK and I had a pretty good convo about our 'break'. I think I feel better about this whole thing. It took a minute for me to warm up to it (If I am in fact warm to it), but it may prove to help in the long run. I guess I dont feel like she's trying to run so much anymore. But best believe I got my feet planted just in case she tries to make a break for it.

						   Can you believe that the republicans of my great state of Ilinois found fucking Alan Keyes to run against Obama Barack.  This cat dont even fucking live in lllinois!!! So does it surprise anyone that the final 2 candidates to run against Obama on the republican ticket are black? Repubs SUCK ASS! They lose their golden boy, Jack Ryan to a sex scandal and then they S C R A M B L E to find a replacement that has at least a snowballs chance in hell. But it's over for them on this one. They may win some but they just lost one on this. Obama is taking it. Plus Keyes has proven he cant win an election, any election to save his life. Not only has he run for, I think a Congress seat unsuccessfully, but he ran for President 2 times!!!! Dont he know if Jesse, who even alot WHITE FOLKS KNOW cant do it, then he damn sure cant take the presidency! Judy Barr Topinka sucks ass! They need to lay it down.

'Here And Now' by Luther 4. 'Inseperable' by Natalie Cole 5. 'I Just Cant Stop Loving You' by Michael Jackson 6. 'When WIll I See You Again' by Babyface 7. 'And Our Feelings' by Babyface  ....yup! Not one but 2 Babyface songs!!! It's a wrap! That shit is soooo.....boo! I cant deal. Oh shit! WAIT A SECOND!!! Is this 'Sara Smile' by Hall &amp; Oates? Awww man. This song is sweet, but depressing as hell. AND AND AND we were supposed to go see them later this month. And fyi....we are officially on a 'break' as of earlier today. :-(

						   I just happened to hear the song just as my shift ended at work and the lyrics jumped out to me....  In heaven's name why are you walking away Hang on to your love In heaven's name why do you play these games Hang on to your love  Take time if you're down on luck It's so easy to walk out on love Take your time if the going gets tough It's so precious So if you want it to get stronger You'd better not let go You gotta hold on longer If you want your love to grow Gotta stick together Hand in glove Hold tight, don't fight  Hang on to your love In heaven's name why are you walking away Hang on to your love In heaven's name why do you play these games Hang on to your love  Be brave when the journey is rough It's not easy when you're in love Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough It's not easy don't give up  If you want it to get stronger You'd better not let go You gotta hold on longer If you want your love to grow Gotta stick together Hand in glove Hold tight, don't fight Hang on to your love  In heaven's name why are you walking away Hang on to your love In heaven's name why do you play these games Hang on to your love   So if you want it to get stronger You'd better not let go You gotta hold on longer If you want your love to grow Gotta stick together Hand in glove Hold tight, don't fight Hang on to your love  In heaven's name why are you walking away Hang on to your love In heaven's name why do you play these games Hang on to your love  When you find a love (to your love) Don't let it walk away When you find your love (to your love) You've got to make it stay (hang on) Hang on to your love Don't let it walk away When you find your love Got to make him stay You've got to hang on to your love (to your love) You've got to hang on to your love (to your love) Why are you walking away (why are you walking away) Why do you play these games(play these games)  Hang on to your love

						   ...single life SUCKS! No offense to you singles out there. I just mean it really sucks if you are coming from a LTR. Well maybe some of you were sooo unhappy in your LTR, and couldnt wait to get back out there and play the field, but not the Teejster. I dont wanna go back to wondering if 'she's the one' whenever I meet a new someone. Hells no! I got my one! I'm good homie! If I had my say, my last trip to Singlesville was my LAST TRIP to Singlesville. Feel me? Luther and Gregory sang 'There's Nothing Better Than Love' and they aint neva lied. CHUUUUURCH NIGGA!

						   There's so much to blog about and yet for some reason I cant even begin to organize my thoughts to properly express everything that I want/need to get off my chest. KK and I went through the ringer a whole bunch today. In no particular order we discussed......her moving to L.A. cuz she's just plain ol 'bored' with life in chi-town right about now, people's individual and/or ideal timelines for courting, dating and marriage, and also us needing 'space'. I dunno about this space shit. Aint that what people say to break up with someone w/o really saying the words 'break up'? I mean she might as well had said 'It's not you, it's me!' Shit....I dont wanna break up. I want my poo poo. So yeah...shit gets hard in relationship. Thats to be expected ya know? But personally for the person that I am sure I wanna marry, I cant think of much that would make me wanna place 'space' 'tween them and myself. Maybe I have it all wrong. But I suspect that we both have aspects wrong. Alls I know is I love her, and I cant think of much that we couldnt work out. Maybe I'm a dreamer. Yeah maybe I'm living in Teej World where all problems have solutions, and love conquers all. I know she's frustrated, but I'm frustrated too. I kinda feel like she has created her best facade thingy yet to run away. She told me she was a runner from conflict and challenges from the jump. Everytime she tried to run on me before I grabbed her by the ponytail and brought her back. But this time she somehow tied my hands behind my back so that I cant grab her ponytail, and then she took off. Lil slick heifer. But she dont know who I be does she? I'm T to the mu'fuckin'....I cant un-do my hands sweetie.....I really can.... I'll let you get a couple of steps ahead, but you's mine Kunta!

						   So right now, KK and I are kinda in the middle of a fuss. So of course it's been on my mind all day. I got to thinking on how sometimes KK and I dont always understand where each other is coming from. Things that appear soooo obvious to me may not be for her and vice versa. Feel me? So then I got to thinking how understanding between males and females kinda parallels that of different races like blacks and whites. Like you know how your average white person thinks blacks have it better nowadays. And while we do I guess in comparison to 40 years ago, shit still aint equal,  ya know? So I was thinking on how like a young white person can not fathom the police being a threat. But if you are young black male you know about that all too well. Like a white person will argue you down that racial profiling doesnt exist, and if so they've never seen it. And it's like 'Cuz you aint the one it's happening to!!!'. But the thing is they dont live in it,  so the concept is hard to grasp. But that dont mean it doesnt exist just cause they cant understand it, dig it? And it's the same thing with a man and a woman. Both sexes go through certain things that the other doesnt understand and most times dont recognize. And so that leads to unintentional insensitivity on the others part and then that leads to shit hitting the fan....HARD, and then you are in the middle of a fuss, and then you feel bad cause you dont really wanna be in the middle of a fuss with your sweetie. You just wanna be with your sweetie. But Kweli said it best when he said "Women say men are trife. Men say women is. We just dont understand our fundamental differences. I'm still learning 'em. Actually I just do what comes naturally."

So on my other blog on myspace I said I'd be finding just a regular ol blog spot....to kind of not be on a site used for dating and meeting folks cuz that wasnt my intention. (Contrary to what you may be believe Ms. K) So here it is ladies and gentleman....'Teej Says..'
