      We had big ass beers last night. Justin didnt call me in time to go to his bachelor party. We got krump, found a cat and now it's ours. We bought him a litter box and food and stuff, so I guess we're commited. At first we named him captain krump, but today we decided on buc nasty. He's pretty cute. While I was writing this he dropped a big ass turd next to his litter box. I had to repremand him. Melissa called me today. It's her b-day. She was supposed to meet me at clicks south, but she flaked out. Roseman left today too for california. He has to serve his time for a felony he commited a while back. He beat up some cops...fuck the police, fuck, fuck, fuck the police. I dont know if I'll ever see him again. Anyway...I have to open tommorrow. I'm crashing.

      Mexico was awesome. There were like two hundred people there for the wedding and reception. Jennifer translated for the priest, so we had a bilingual wedding. I had to "lasso" them. It's some catholic thing. The reception was cool too. They didnt have any beer, but they did have brandy and whiskey. We salsa danced and I got a lesson from my new stepmom. While the bride and groom were off at there honeymoon we had a party at rosa's house, and I got to know my new stepbrother. He's really cool, they treated us all really well. The next day me and willow went to get gifts at a fleamarket type place and almost got jacked by some criminals. That was interesting. I also got a parkinh ticket too. I'm going to get the pictures from willow today. I talked to Ed yesterday too. We're going to see the warped tour in Dallas for my birthday. Should be fun.

      I've just worked 7 days in a row so I could get fri sat and sunday off. Papasan is getting married friday. I'm excited. I got the truck registered in my name today...it cost me a hundred bucks! I've been playing phone tag with melissa all day. She was working in the day and wanted me to go to joy and hang out with her. That's awesome! I wish I could have. Hanging out at the strip club all day hanging out with the strippers is pretty cool. Anyway...this will be my last post until sunday. Thatis if the federallies don't lock me in a mexican klinker.

      My friend Justin is getting married on the 19th. My other friend Melissa(who is working at joy ;)) told me. She's planning the wedding and reception. It's weird too because they used to date. Willow is gonna be my date for both weddings. I talked to dad today and he said it was cool to bring her. My dad seems pretty excited. I'm happy for him. I talked to my mom today too. She's in this church group thing that went to houston and saw these ancient chinese artifacts. She's having a lot of fun with them. They go to picnics and all sorts of old lady stuff. Roseman is here too...haven't seen him in a while.

      Talked to Ed a little while ago. We're planning on going to see bad religion in dallas on the 26th. I'll probably spend a few days there. I talked to Bentley too. It's his birthday on the 29th. one day after mine. We're planning on having a double birthday bash. Some bbq and goofing off. Sounds fun. I also talked to willow...she's gonna be my date for my dad's wedding. That ought to be interesting. A few days with willow is like a month.

      I wrote a song for a girl I like...It's pretty good. I recorded it and sent it to Kenny at work. He seemed to like it, or at least he said he did. Didn't go to kris'...too tired. I'm gonna hit the sack.

      Today sucked at work. Reagan died yesterday and I'm watching a special on him. He has to be one of the greatest presidents ever. He really was just a great man. I'm going to watch the nba playoffs at tall kris' house later.

      I saw like 10 stupid bikers wrecked on the side of the road today. They drive like maniacs. Anyway, the visit with papasan was a bust. He wanted me to help him load all of the rest of his crap. He moved to eagle pass last week. He's getting married this saturday. Jesus christ...the man is 63!!! I can't even get a date and he's working on his third marriage. Oh well. Anyway, tonights a laid back night too. I'm just gonna drink a beer, watch a movie and pass the fuck out.

      I just woke up and called my dad. He's in town. He could'nt find a hotel. He had to go all the way to san marcos to find one. I'm gonna go over there in a little while to visit him and my future stepmom. I think I'm gonna head over to toys-r-us too, to see if they have any cool simpsons crap.
