           It was not a good start to Monday, our corporate web site went down last night and apparently no one had a clue till today morning. How can someone not be monitoring the corporate web site for the company? Well anyway somehow we had a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) and had to cold boot the server for the site to come back up. Everything is back up now and working fine, but we have started working on a new monitoring service. You know how it works; we put things in place after things break. Why cannot we do that before they break?     J  &nbsp;

      That is the question that my wife and kids have been trying to answer since the advent of time. What do you give the guy who loves gadgets and has all the gadgets...he he he...but trust me I still could do with some more. I have my eyes on a cool looking flat panel TV's, the kinds you could hang on the wall and admire all day long. But my wife says her credit card does not have that much limit, yea right.  But, as everyone knows I am a humble guy and would settle for something cheaper like a Sony DVD Handycam Camcorder which is available on eBay pretty cheap. You know what, this year I was pretty slick and left the catalog for Sharper Image open on an item I would have loved to have, forgot what it was, do you think she got the hint?  No matter what I wrote it on my whiteboard at home:  Dad does not want any of these for father's day:  Ties / clothes / gift certificates / rain checks / watch / books  I will let you guys know what I finally end up with on father's day. Keep your fingers crossed just as I will for all you dads out there.  Happy Father's Day !

          After a tremendous amount of anticipation, Sony has announced their portable media player, the HMP-A1. (HMP stands for Hard Disk Multiplayer.) In mobility hungry Japan, the Sony HMP is sure to be a big hit.  The HMP does everything right. It sports a cool Sony chassis, built around the 3.5" TFT. The symmetric navigation-button layout includes a touch-sensitive slide, and can be operated in left- or right- hand mode (by flipping the HMP). For audio, it supports MP3. (This is definitively better than Sony's other music player, which requires MP3s to be converted to a proprietary ATRAC format.) The 20gb HDD stores about 300 hours of music. For video, it supports MPEG2 and MPEG4. You can even play back your videos on a TV, since there's integrated AV out.  If you've stored photos on the HMP, you can view their thumbnails, or view them as a slideshow. The HMP is recognized as a plug-n-play HDD under Windows and supports USB 2.0 for very fast data transfer. So, you can use it as an external HDD as well.

        urlLink     Sony announced a new 5MP Digital Camera with a swivel lens. Similar to its 2MP mini camera cousin Cybershot DSC-U50   the swivel lens is great for making photos of yourself.   The lens is a Zeiss(R) Vario Tessar(R) with 3X optical zoom that can rotate 300 degrees. The camera has a 1.8-inch LCD screen. The F88 takes both the Memory Stick(R)and Memory Stick PRO(TM) memory cards.   It will be interesting to see if the red and blue versions will make it outside of Japan. The US press-release only shows the silver one.  The Black Cybershot DSC-T1   is for instance only available in Japan.   The DSC-F88 will be available in July for $450 MSRP.

           The Sony Qualia 016 holds the top spot for the world's smallest digital camera that features a display with 69.1×16.8×24mm (without Flash, size nearly doubles when flash is attached).  Besides being ultra small the Qualia 016 is full of technology and comes with a suit-case full of accessories. For instance, in order to eliminate the blur caused by tiny movements of the hand, the 016 takes up to 4 pictures in very rapid succession and then combines them into one image. The Sony Qualia is hand assembled and only available in very low numbers.  Japanese Gadget Exporter Dynamism is selling it for $4,780.00 on special order.

          The Wearable Color TV VTV-101 we tested was a loaner from someone who had received a test product. The box had the main small TV unit, antenna earphone, wrist band, external battery-pack, AC power adaptor and neck strap.  The TV unit itself measures 48x48x18mm and weighs 50g (my measurements), making it the smallest TV I have ever seen. The TV display itself measures 1.5" diagonal. Above the TV display is a digital Time indicator. NHJ (the manufacturers) did a great job to make the wearable TV versatile to use. I could either snap the TV unit on the wrist strap to wear it as a Wrist Watch, attach the neck strap to wear it or clip it onto the external battery unit to get extended power. The external battery-pack functions also as the charging station for the VTV-101. Because the TV unit is very light, wearing it at the wrist is quite comfortable. With 18mm height the Watch is definitely bulky, but acceptable. The wrist band is a free adjustable Velcro band.

          Nestled in a Reuters story about Nintendo's financials (boring) I found this little piece of information:   "In order to have the DS out by Christmas, we plan to start production late summer or early fall and boost production every month," Nintendo Senior Managing Director Yoshihiro Mori told a news conference.   "The shipment forecast for the DS, due out later this year in Japan and the United States, is more optimistic than Sony Corp's target to ship three million units of its PlayStation Portable (PSP), a new handheld due out later this year in Japan."   Nintendo intends to have the Nintendo DS in stores for us by Christmas? I have my fingers crossed :-)

           I had the unique opportunity of trying this "available only in Japan for now" model of Sony Cybershot DSC-T11. It is the thinnest 5 MP digital camera in the world. In addition to being 5mp, the DSC-T11 has 3x optical zoom! At only 17.3mm (0.68") thick, this is quite an accomplishment. It also boasts of a huge 2.5" TFT and Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The camera it self is a piece of art, slim, sleek and awesome body. I did take a few pictures with it and was not very happy with the outcome. I think Sony needs to improve on the quality of the pictures of the digital cameras, I have tried a few different kinds but same results. Pictures were grainy and sometimes blurred, I think my Nikon 4 MP camera does a better job. Except for the convenience of carrying in your shirt pocket and good looks, this is one gadget I would pass on. Did you know this camera does not even have a viewfinder, you have to rely on the LCD to view and take pictures, resulting in a lot of battery drain.
