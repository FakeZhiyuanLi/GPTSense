      I don’t know why, today I have been so mad! Without a reason, I just want to shout at everyone and hit everything! The good thing is until now I have controlled myself well, haven’t let any of those happen. Guess I’m just being home for too long. So I decide to take another course. I want to learn another kind of language because till now besides Chinese I can only speak English. I have both French and Spanish on my list but I don’t know which one to choose. Dad would rather me learn Germany than French. He has got a prejudice about France. I don’t know why. Tonight mum and dad had a fight again. As always I seemed to be the root. I want to say much about it. But I’m so tired. I just wish I could leave here as soon as possible, we don’t really fit in with each other. Such a family, might be also the root of my fear of marriage and family. I don’t know since when these two words don’t mean something about love and warm anymore, so what’s left…

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn I’m almost dead today! At the very first the server told me that since it’s a free one it wouldn’t told more than 50 files for me. Ok so I found another server for supporting and transported some of the files there, then corrected all the link! Finally when it’s all set. This morning when I woke up and opened my email box, very well, there came a waning letter telling me that my site would be disabled for 24 hours for I exceeded its limited everyday bandwidth! How should I know there was such a thing! Well poor site it’s not that good but still my work! Just finished! You know what? All this taught me a lesson, there is no such perfect thing as free on the internet. Today I finally watched the movie “school of rock”. To tell the truth it was not so good as I had expected, but still not bad for aspiring. As always this kind of movies made me think of a lot of things, such as the passion of making a band I used to have and the days I was learning guitar. Somehow later I quitted. I guess I really didn’t have enough patience to learn such 6-string thing. Maybe I should have started doing it when I was younger not now when it’s all too late. Well but I still love music. Guess I would write it in another section of my dream.

      Today is a big day since when my personal homepage officially started. This is also the beginning for me to keep dairy and upload them here. Making this site, to be honest, didn’t really take much time. Therefore I’m not very confident about it either. There isn’t much content till now but I will add new things to make it more interesting gradually. So thank you for visiting. And I must thank those who provide me stuff to build such site, I haven’t got the copyright of some of the things here but just cut them from the internet

      Isn’t it funny. When you are viewing these words, you may not know that I can’t even see my own dairy through this site. Why? Don’t you know that there is a door that locks us out of the freedom world on the internet. I am saying the internet controlling in China. Because of it, I can’t even open a site in yahoo Geo Cities. I don’t know how many more sites I can’t access. Just because our communism party don’t want us to know anything that we are not supposed to know. I mean, the truth. They only reason that they wanna cover the truth from our eyes is that they are afraid, afraid of being changed, or losing their power. However I wonder how long this situation can last, how many times people can be fooled. Isn’t it a big joke to live in a country like this. Today’s karate training is not that pleasure. That girl was really annoying. She did nothing but flirt with the teacher. Damn, if she didn’t wanna really do some practice why didn’t she just quit and just dated him! She even spoiled my training. To tell the truth there was a moment that I really wanted to beat her up. Well I didn’t. Anyway damn her.

      I am really being home for tooo long. I began to have some weird ideas in my mind now, I think if I keep on living in this way, I would be crazy. I feel like going out for a trip, though the weather these days is definitely not fit for traveling. There are many places that I want to visit. And I don’t know why, I suddenly got very interested in Nepal. To tell the truth I don’t know anything about this country except for it’s near China and famous for its fantastic nature beauty and great snow mountains. I searched for some information about it on the Internet. After reading some article written by those tourists who have been there, the friendly people and old culture attracted me as well. Only one thing, the ticket fly to Nepal and then back costs more and 4500 Yuan RMB, that’s $500. Dear how can I possibly afford it. I’m not sure if I can go there one day. But you see living in a planet like this, but only hang around a place big as my house, it’s such a shame isn’t it. I saw on the traveling forum, there were so many people living the life they want to live, visting different places, experience different lifestyle. That’s what I mean when I say I wouldn’t feel sorry when I reach the end of my life and look back.  Since I can’t feel Nepal myself recently, I went to yahoo chat room where I usually murder my time, Nepal room, too feel it virtually. But it was a surprise that I actually found it fun there. I mean, it was even more alive than the china room, more people would like to talk. So I made a few friends there. And they told me that actually it was no good to visit Nepal at this time of the year. Since it’s rain season, there are a lot of floods and clouds. Today my mood got a little bit better. And I really enjoyed my karate class this afternoon. Though I always do but not as much as today. When we were warming up, we did something interesting. It was like that we stood in a line and bent over our body, the first one then must jump over all of us, of course one person a time, when he past us all, he stood in the end of the line, also bent his body over, it started again from the second person in front. Lol I didn’t do very well, hit several people, so I hope they didn’t hate me :P after that, we started to turn somersaults. I don’t usually do it, so I make them in a stupid way, didn’t look good :P the other trainings were hard as usually, and I sweated a lot, got my cloths all wet. Anyway today is not a bad day…

      I was very mad today. I was stolen 10 Yuan. No, I was not mad for losing the money but the way it happened. This afternoon, after lunch my mobile rang. I checked it, and saw a message saying that there was some urgency she tried to call me but couldn’t get through, she had left me a message and told me to send “10” to a number to get the message. And it was from one of my friends. Though I had no idea what kind of urgency she could have or why she couldn’t get through. I did as she told, sent “10” to that number anyway. A few seconds later I got a reply, telling me that I had agreed to pay 10 Yuan to somewhere. Damn I got shocked. I knew that there were cheats like this in mobile messages but I never knew this could happen to me, especially I was so familiar with the number it was from. I dialed to my friend to ask what was going on immediately. However I couldn’t find her either. I don’t believe it was really her that did this, so I wanted to inform her about this. Until now I have not really find her and I don’t know what exactly was that message. To tell the truth I am not in good mood these days. The little story I finished and posted online yesterday makes no sense. And I’m not expecting anyone else to understand it either. Just a way to express something. To avoiding drowning in that situation, I must make myself much busier. Because when I have time, I just can’t help thinking about those things. I decide to take French course. But it has started since some days ago, so I have to wait to next time which may begin at the early August. I hope it will make my life more alive. Sometimes I think I’m just too emotional, take everything as a signal, live in my own imagination, don’t know if it’s another frustration. Lol it rhythms.

      It was summertime. With the theme of the cicada, all the plants in that small garden grew flourishingly. A group of mimosa pudica bloomed beside an old honey locust. Their little purple flowers were not so beautiful as that branch of azalea or fragrant as the gardenia. But they looked so special in a place full of green. Some wind breezed over, all the mimosa closed their leaves, bent their bodies. Among them, there was one little mimosa. She looked so poor and weak. She didn’t even have a little flower. Nothing but one single stick. The wind had past, all the other mimosa stretched their bodies, waving their flowers again. However our little mimosa, she couldn’t put her head up still. Such a poor little thing. Just then, came a beetle. That was a newborn bug. He came along, walking, with his flashy orange shell reflecting the sunshine. He went past the group of mimosa, having his head up to the sky. There were some purple bubbles on a piece of blue-back-grounded paper. Until he found a low hanging face, to the ground. She didn’t have any purple. This was the little mimosa. All of her leaves were scrolled together. The beetle got a little bit curious. He knew that this kind of sensitive plants close their leave when being touched, but at other time they keep them stretched to let more sunshine in, just like all the other plants. This little mimosa he was facing looked so weak, not having enough sunshine was obviously the reason. Not having much ahead to do, the beetle decided to stop and have a talk with this weird mimosa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …… &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, little mimiosa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……. Humm, why are you having your leaves closed? You’d better stretch them out to let in more sunshine. It’s none of your business! Maybe but if you keep being without flowers, you won’t have any seeds. So what? Hey you are a very special mimosa, if you had no seeds, after some time there would be no more other mimosa like you in this garden. That would be such a pity. I can’t open my leaves. Why not? …… See I was born to have one of my antennas longer than the other one. They are supposed to be of the same length. Well anyway they are enough to me to use. So it’s ok. Besides, that’s something other beetles don’t have. It makes me even proud of it. I feel very special. What’s your specialty? …humm the outer part of my leaves, lack a layer of protection. I mean, it’s thinner than usual. Therefore when I stretch them out to the sunshine for too long, it gets hurt. I don’t think it’s a big deal. You can just open them for a few time, when close them for another time to get resumed. Because of the problem of my leaves, I have grown strangely since I was young. I don’t even look like mimosa anymore but some normal weed. So the other mimosa laugh at me when I open and close my leaves. This is not gonna work… hey how about I stay here talking with you when you stretch out leaves, I can dance or fly over you as well, so that you wouldn’t feel that nervous. Hummm I don’t know. Come on! Let’s try it. Gradually the little mimosa opened her leaves. The other mimosa beside her looked at her jeeringly. She tried not to pay any attention on them, but that lovely beetle. That’s my baby mimosa. They talked and talked. After some time, the beetle suddenly turned up and said &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to close your leaves. How are you feeling? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good, I feel like full of energy So there past one day, two days……  Until one day little mimosa bloomed a single purple flower. The very first time in her time, she knew what makes it significant. &nbsp;You are so beautiful, my little mimosa. They had a great celebration for it. Times past by, day by day. The little mimosa and the beetle continued their conversation. Our mimosa got healthier and healthier and became strong. Sometime the beetle had something to do and couldn’t come to her, her could just face up everything on her own. Actually gradually the other mimosa no long had anything against little mimosa stretching and closing her leaves. That day, the little mimosa was waiting for the beetle to come as usual. She got so many things to tell him this time. However from dawn to dark, he didn’t appear. Yesterday he didn’t inform the little mimosa about anything either. The little mimosa started being a bit worried. No accidents please… she didn’t know since when the moon came up to the sky, her leaves got closed naturally. She felt so sleepy but she didn’t want to sleep. Because she didn’t want to miss the beetle if he came. However she fell asleep in the end anyway, and somehow the beetle didn’t come either. Nothing, the second day. In the morning of the third day, when the little mimosa woke up, she opened her eyes, she saw the beetle, Standing in front of her. Or was there anything wrong with her eyes? She saw two beetles. One of them began to talk to her Morning my little mimosa, how are you doing these days. Sorry I didn’t come these days but I am sure that you are able to deal with everything on your own now right? I had great harvest these days. This is Reddy, my girl friend, I met her that day on my way to the big honey locust. We have only met each other for a few days, but we really feel great with each other. But still, we are not sure whether we can really be a family. So we decided to spend some time to have a trip together so that we can judge. And here we are, to say a temporary goodbye to you. Suddenly, the little mimosa seemed to hear a sound of something breaking. Was it the heart? She got dazed for a while, looking at those two beetles right in front her, she couldn’t tell which was male and which was female. She realized that she actually didn’t know anything about this species. Oh ok, sure, I can take care of myself. Have a good trip you two, I see you later. She didn’t know what more to say, though she knew that she should have said a lot more. Her brain didn’t work at that moment. So instead, she smiled, so sadly. In the following days, time past so slow. But what surprised the little mimosa was that she was really able to take care of herself, opening and closing the leaves. Even that time when she was thinking about the olds of her and the beetle and forgot to close them in time, she didn’t feel much pain. Was her numb, or after all the days of being under the sunshine, the layer of her leaves got thicker, not afraid of the burning sun anymore. One week later, when the two beetles returned to the group of mimosa again. They couldn’t find a weaker, smaller one. All the mimosa was growing flourishingly, facing the sun.

      last night i felt like a drunk person, had my head all messed up, just grabed someone here to " listen to me whine".  but after it, my sight was wider and i was able to see more and then have a good sleep. this morning, when i woke up, it was sunny outside, and yesterday was just like a dream (or rather nightmare :P ) and i had a much clearer mind. yes, i need to be stronger, how can i be stuck on little things like this and keep on troubling myself. there are more things waiting for me to do and more beauty waiting for me to discover. so, cheer up girl!

      i guess it's pretty important to have an aim in our life. so that we have something to work for and the faith that keeps us strungle. maybe not everyone is as happy as they have expected when they achievement their aim, but at least all the way we have gone for it is rememberable and the workinf through is enjoyable. however there is one thing painful, that is when you are totally aware of your aim and cant do nothing about it. and then we just hope that it's a break, a break that for us to go on to even further

      these days i have formed a new habbit. under the building of my house was a small piece of grassland, and it stretches until the porch between another building and the sidewall. at night, i go to sit at the side of the wall, there i have the only peace i can find in this noisy place. sometimes there is wind blowing, then the leaves on the trees make sounds as " sha sha", it feels so cool, like the autumn. with some piece of music or not, i get into a perfect mood of thinking of things: how my past was, what my future will be like... i think of my friends, mates, parents, and...someone, or i think of nothing, just stare at the blur lights ahead, enjoying the breeze. there is a big tree out of the wall but its leaves go across here, sometimes i look up and see the shadow between. is someone out there? sometimes i really want to have a sleepbag and settle down there, isnt it so good to fall asleep smelling the sweet of the grass, hearing the song of crickets
