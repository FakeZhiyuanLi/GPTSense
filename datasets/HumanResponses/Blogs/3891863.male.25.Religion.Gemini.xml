      Well... for me... tomorrow sees the embarkment of Holt (SU) Holiday Mission 2004.  I can't believe it is here already. I hope to bring you updates throughout the week of all the exciting things that God is doing. But if I don't - please forgive me because I will probably be too busy or asleep!  God has really blessed me this year by giving me an overwhelming sense of peace about it all. I know that everything is in his hands.. and all we can do is do our best and he will use that to bring Him glory.  So if you can - pray for the team and I as we declare Jesus in this town.

      A  week  before the mission and it's all very interesting.  Often I wonder how God will work things out to bring him glory as sometimes things seem a little too complicated.  But I  trust  in God. He has my friends lives in his hands and he knows what is best.  So I   pray   that God will reveal his plan for their lives and also mine and that he is glorified so much that people can't deny that he is real. If you're wondering I'm still waiting to hear from both of the below... so there go...

         Something that made me laugh the other night! It was Shell's comment and a couple of days later Stu said "I need to get into the mindset of the flip flop"  Well then for those of you that know.. I'm still waiting to hear from Bradford and SU - it can be a bit on the frustrating side all this waiting. But I guess its all really exciting too... I'm so excited that God has a huge plan for me and he wants to bless me. He is an amazing God without a doubt! I'll be less cryptic soon... but I'm too busy at the moment not to be!

      I like Pie. pie is good!      I just thought I'd mention that I'm going into school again (4 times!) this week. I find it strange that people are so desperate to grow up and then once people grow up they're so desperate to be a kid again!

      If I don't speak to you during August it might be because I'm in the middle of the  Holt Holiday Mission ... or perhaps I just don't want to talk to you! This year I'll be leading the mission team solo... which is pretty exciting stuff. It's all based on the  John 10:10  verse which is an excellent verse reminding us that being a Christian doesn't mean we have to wear sandals and  "I love Jesus"  tshirts and be dull and boring but we can experience life in all its fullness!  Please pray for good weather and that many kids come along and have an excellent time with all the leaders. Oh and pray for the final preparations as well as they're a bit of a long hard slog. Things this year seem to be taking forever!

So.. if you're reading this   you   are one of the select  nice people  in my life!  I'll keep you updated with my postings and for now.. some wise old words   "What we do in life - echoes in eternity"
