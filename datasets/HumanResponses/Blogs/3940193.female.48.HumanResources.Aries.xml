      I decided to come to Blogger after so much I have written has been lost to crashing computers. The journal of insanity had been kept up to date on my other computer, and all the updates were lost when that computer died an untimely and unexpected death. In the updates the additions to my family were entered- so I will do a quick update now and hopefully will find the time, now that I am unemployed, to re- do the updates. Ron is my oldest son who was not living at home when this journal began. He is 25 now, and moved back in last year when his marriage to Kim ended after three years. Kristi is my youngest daughter and is now 22. When I began this journal she was living with her husband Mark and their 2 kids-Andrew and Alyssa who are 5 and 3. Since this was written she also had twin girls, Morgan and Madison. Kristi is living at home now also. And so begins my journal of insanity...... Journal of Insanity  1.25.03 I have had probably 4 people in the last 2 weeks tell me I should keep a journal of my life. I’ve been told that my family, which consists of my husband Fred, my two boys, Michael, 8, Aaron,7, Amber, our 22 year old college student, and our six dogs makes for great humor situations. I think this is crazy because I do not see it that way at all. I see it as incredibly stressful and as a coping mechanism I write to friends and bitch. Then I get back letters that say things like …”Your letter was so funny” and “Your house has got to be the funniest place to live….” The problem with this is that I am not being funny. I do not see much that goes on in a humorous light. Now that I have found myself as the subject of great humor I am trying to NOT write bitching letters, I am, instead, slamming my head against walls and cursing my insensitive friends. My husband recently suggested this might be the cause of the headaches I’ve had. I think he may be right so I have decided to follow the advice of my former friends and keep a journal.  It seems to me that I have become a victim of my own life, rather than the captain of my ship. This may be because I spend all my time putting out fires instead of figuring out what is causing the fire to start with.  I am also a master of mixed metaphors.... So as a means of getting in control I need to figure out what each of my family members are thinking, which direction they are heading and then I keep two steps in front of them. This goes for the dogs as well. Dogs are very intelligent creatures and always have motivations for their actions. Granted, most of these motivations have to do with food- either ours or theirs and then the dumping of that food on my carpets. But they have other thoughts as well…they love and hate, fight and play, hunt and gather, and hump like the animals they are. So I need to also understand my dogs. The fish are okay, they rarely do anything to stress me out. The rabbit and guinea pigs are also okay. Their biggest issues are their stink but really, they can’t do anything about that. They can’t hold it in forever, and they can’t clean their own cages or get their own food and water so I am going to have to refer the rabbit and guinea pigs-stink issues to Fred and the kids.  My much beloved and cherished husband is Fred. After getting off to a rocky start nine years ago, we hit the ground running and have been madly in love ever since. Fred is the perfect husband; considerate, kind, generous, affectionate and a great lover. (You never know if he is going to read this and we do have to cover all the bases….) Fred is into cars. My ex-husband ( a whole other journal…) had a stack of porno magazines under his side of the bed. Fred has auto magazines. Our bedroom is filled with model cars; you name the car, it's in our bedroom. I used to feel like those cars were watching me with their beady little headlights. I had bad dreams about them coming to life in a ‘Christine’ kind of way and I would be found dead in bed from carbon monoxide poisoning. I’ve worked through those fears now. Our, or I should say, his garage is packed tight with cars and car parts that will probably never again see the light of day. The worst thing I can say to Fred is, “Gee honey, let's clean out the garage.” I think it physically hurts him to think of throwing away one screw, fender, or what are those things called that make the gas go to the engine…. carburetor. He cannot do it. I used to argue, then I reasoned but I have given up. You need to accept a person’s limitations.  So that pretty much describes my sweetheart. Except for one thing. Fred’s way of dealing with stress is to stress me out. He will never just go into the hallway and bang his head against a wall. Nope, not Fred. He bitches, he pisses and moans at me like I am not experiencing the same damn stress he is and I can do something about it. He corners me in the car-filled bedroom and just rants and raves. It makes me crazy. I need to figure out what to do about these episodes.  Our son Michael is not only highly organized, he is very self-disciplined. Many might see this as a great quality in an eight-year old kid, but to me it is a pain in the ass. If Mike brings home a paper that has to be signed and returned the next day he will nag me unmercifully to sign it. He refuses to go to bed until it is signed and then put in his backpack. He doesn’t understand that the more he nags me the longer I will put off signing it. Disorganization works for me. I’m the kind of mother who likes to sign things as kids run out the door. It gives my signature that flair that you just can’t get while sitting at a table or leaning on a counter. Mike also does his homework as soon as he gets home from school and will sometimes do extra homework while in bed at night just for the heck of it. I was the kid who’s dog always ate my homework so I cant even begin to relate to this side of my son. I like him best when he is all squishy and huggy, or when he is a typical pain in the ass kid.  Then there is Aaron. Aaron is the complete opposite of Mike. He couldn’t care less if the teacher ever gets a form back signed unless it interferes with his playground or snack time. He is God’s way of showing me I had pushed my luck too far by having five kids. After four semi-normal children, I got Aaron! Aaron has actually me a good many miles toward the insanity point that he has his own story written with love by me, that I give to each of his teachers...as a way of alerting them to what he is capable of doing. hello! Sorry its been so long since I wrote- things have been getting away from me lately. So what's new, right? I like to pretend this is out of the norm, but in reality, I am usually in a state of chaos. As I'm writing this, Mike is on the phone yelling to Andrew over and over - "it's your birthday Andrew- Happy Birthday Andrew."  Either Andrew has been struck deaf on the morning of his 4th birthday or he is just not getting it. Someone should have explained the whole Happy Birthday thing or he is going to wonder why people are shouting at him all day. It may even cause him to grow in to the kind of person who hates birthdays. But, as I keep telling Fred, this isn't my problem. The kids are adults now and what they do is their business. If Kristi and Mark want to keep Andrew in the dark concerning his birthday I am going to mind my own business. Hopefully I can talk Fred in to minding his own business. Anyway, while Mike was yelling at Andrew, Aaron was running around the living singing "Happy Birthday to Andrew" as loud as he was able to. That, combined with the television blasting, was a little overwhelming to me. Since I know it is impossible to get Aaron to shut up I turned down the TV. Imagine Andrew's horror when Aaron took the phone from Mike and started the Happy Birthday song all over again at the top of his voice. Kids who are four do not understand the concept of "birthing." I, myself, didn't understand the concept of uteruses, birth canals, and vagina's until I was about 15 and then I was so horrified by the picture this thought conjured in my mind, I denied it. I swore for years I did not come in to the world that way. I was sure I had been a cesarean baby, because the alternative was just downright unacceptable. Of course this wasn't the kind of thing I could ask my mother. Words such as vagina were never spoken in my home. Neither were uterus or birth canal. In fact, pregnant wasn't spoken either. Women were going to have a baby. They wouldn't be pregnant in our home. We were never told these words were unacceptable because that would mean the words would have to be spoken-or written on a black board or some such thing. We knew because we had never heard the words spoken. And we witnessed the terribly awkward silence that would meet a visitor who spoke those words. I raised my kids to be mature about such words. We are all determined not to raise our kids the way we ourselves were raised. When my kids and I needed to talk about sex, we just came right out and said FUDGE. This system worked very well for us. If anyone we knew had sex, they had made fudge. If someone in school was going to have a baby, we all knew they ate fudge, and we would have mature discussions at the dinner table about who the mother-to-be had eaten fudge with. And would they get married and make more fudge or move on and make fudge with someone else.... My kids loved my mother. They loved going over to her house and staying with her for weekends or even weeks. And in thinking about this whole situation with Andrew not knowing it was his birthday or even what a birthday is, I just realized that it may be possible that Kristi spent way too much time with my mother. I am going to have to call Kristi and tell her that it is very easy to explain birthdays to a four year old. All she has to do is tell Andrew that five years ago she and daddy made fudge, and a year later they found Andrew in a basket on their front porch. Easy as pie, right? 8/04- I have been getting a lot of feed back about Aaron lately. Amber told me he called her cell phone repeatedly aand when she didn’t call him back he made one last effort to get her to call… it went like this: "Amber, this is Aaron. I have been calling you and you haven’t called me back. I need to talk to you…(PAUSE followed by high pitched wail) AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH, Amber, my eye is bleeding, my eye is bleeding." Then Aaron's normal voice continued…"Could you call me back please?" Then there is the whole money begging thing going on. Aaron is no longer allowed to use the IM feature of AOL. It seems he used my screen name to solicit video game funds from my friend Anita. He said "Hi, I need 20 bucks." She said "Michele, is this you?" And to be fair to Aaron he did tell her it wasn’t me asking her for money, it was him, Aaron and he needed 20 bucks for a video game. Next, he sent my sister an email asking if she would like to give him some money because his mother didn’t care if he never got another game in his life. There was also the time in Kohls when he went with his brother, Ron,  to buy a pair of shoes. He went to the guy working the shoe dept and told him that he and his brother were poor and would they give his brother a free pair of shoes…. The guy said no. Aaron wasn’t really bothered by the guys refusal at all, but his brother was pretty mortified about the whole thing.
