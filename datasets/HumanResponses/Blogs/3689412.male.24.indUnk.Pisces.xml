      Well, after I saw the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 with my sister and her boyfriend and his friends, It was about 3:00 am. Heh the funny part is my sister's boyfriend's friends parked in a garage that closed around 2:00 am. So, they had no way to get home, so we all got squeezed into one car with about 10 people in a 5 person car, and we took them to the Marriott lobby which they would stay until the metro/bart would open at 4:00 am, and then just take the metro/bart home. Yea...and oh! This homeless dude was hella stalking us, and asking for money and calling us retards...

      Fahrenheit 9/11 came out on Friday (today), yet I got to see it yesterday. Well in a sense I saw it today, but basically I saw it Thursday at 12:00 at night. I would rate the movie a 11/10, and I recommend all of you to see it.  Fahrenheit 9/11 will be the first movie ever to change the elections. Basically the movie shows how much an idiot George W. Bush is, Michael Moore also shows the people what really happened September 11, and what our president was really doing about it... Well I don't want to give the movie away, so go watch it!   Anyways, I just changed the layout of my blog, this is not one of their "stock" blogs this is a hand edited version, that only I have. Well soon it will be on blog everywhere cause there are a lot of copy cats! >:(.

      Heh, I was just playing UT2004, with my fellow hunters. We pretty much owned the whole time except for 1 or 2 games. Ugh yea, hunters own at Onslaught.   Also, I started the UT2004 class for making your own game, coding it and stuff, it's going to take me sixty hours to complete. So I have no clue if I'm going to finish it or not but today I watched an one hour of it, and surprisingly I was focused in what they were saying. Usually in school I tend to drift off because either the work is to easy for me or I'm just not interested in what they are teaching. Though in UT2004 classes you have no idea how fun it is, just knowing at the end of this you will have the ability to make your own games.  I can already see me making hunter themed games. It's gonna be fun.

      Today, I was rather pleased to find out a little more about John F. Kennedy's death. I also saw this clip/video/image for the first time. It was quite amazing how his head flew forward and then back. After reading a little more about his death I soon realize that some people believe that there was more then 1 shooter.         Then i saw John F. Kennedy's autopsy photos, which can be find  urlLink Here .  Now after reading this you may think I'm some creepy guy, but I'm really not. I'm just simply interested on how he got killed, and it also amazes me on how it 'looks', because I have never seen a dead body ever, at this desformation.
