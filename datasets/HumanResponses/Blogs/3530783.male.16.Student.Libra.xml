      HEY WHATSUP...i doubt anyone will ever ever read this...least on a regular basis...but who does? ya i just needed a place to put everything down on paper...or w/e this stuff is made out of... and also i made this for all those boring days in the summer where this just might cross your mind and then u can read it...so if u read it then awesome, this is just mostly me talking to whoever wants to hear aight...aight......so ya comment if u have any other enlightening comments u wanna make or if u just wanna make fun of me...Thanks...i appreciate it...o YA Jenilee thanks with the hard thought naming process...        So i guess ill start this whole thing by telling a funny story...ya it happened i guess 3 days ago and anyways i was at this grad. party @ the duffies and well it was pouring down rain of course and everyone and their cat was there. So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd. So you would probably think thats a good thing but i was chilln upSTAIRS and so i'd have to go up n down em to get more...well so i run outta chips and so i get up to go down for more and im headin down the stairs and i catch glance of this amazingly hott girl(not sayin who) and well i guess i lost focus for a second cuz my hand with the plate of hot sauce hit the side rail and i missd a step and ya the plate toppled all over the white carpeted stairs... and all over mrs. stark who was sitting on them for some reason?? so ya it was embarrasing...especially asking mrs duffie for something to clean it up with... mrs stark wasnt mad..PHEW and it ended up bein alrite besides the embarrassment...so basically the moral of the story is Never NEVER eat the hot sauce at those so called "GRAD PARTIES". just don't...its not worth the risk...the RUSH is only for a second...but the consequences they never go away...so DONT...Do...GRAD Hot SAuce...       THE MORE YOU KNOW...
