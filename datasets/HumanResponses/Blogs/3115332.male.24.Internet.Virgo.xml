        urlLink This is my new all-time favorite quote . Last paragraph is pure gold.  I wish I had this problem more often.  Maybe I should become an actor...

       If you are into death metal of any kind, and haven't checked out the  urlLink Old Skool Slayer  shoes, you really need to.  They are a limited run, with the Slayer logo on the tongue and the Eagle logo on the back.  Pretty sweet if you are a fan.

       I used to think I was a huge geek  urlLink until I saw this . Yes, I play tabletop RPGs, but at least I don't dress up, play a girl, or pretend I know magic!  This is just sad. At least humanity will be spared further embarrassment of this kind since it's pretty obvious none of these people will ever,  ever  breed.

        urlLink This is one of the weirdest things I've every seen.  I would have thought this was really badass when I was in highschool.  Worth a look if you are bored.

       I get at least 2-3 spam messages from my computer parts supplier every day.  Once in a while, the subject catches my attention and I take a peek. This last message I got stated they had a 478 motherboard & a MX440 card for $78 bundled.  Wondering about the quality of the product, I click on the specs link and I am whisked away to the wondrous homepage of  urlLink Albatron . The header on their page, quite possibly their company slogan, reads  urlLink Albatron---Captures the spirit of the Albatross . I nearly piss my pants with laughter. I can only assume that this Taiwanese company is confusing the large bird with something else.  For those of you who don't get why this is funny, here is the definition straight from  urlLink Dictionary.com :       Any of several large web-footed birds constituting the family Diomedeidae,    chiefly of the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, and having a hooked beak and    long narrow wings.      &nbsp;         A constant, worrisome burden.           An obstacle to success.

       Today I was pretty bored so I looked up a couple of my favorite sites,  urlLink Japander ,  urlLink Engrish  and  urlLink J-List . Japander is a great clip-site with commericals from Japan starring American actors.  The Schwarzenegger ones are some of the funniest I've ever seen. Check them out if you get a second.

       After reviewing the wonderful and interesting world of blogs, I have decided to create one as well, since there isn't enough crap on the net yet. If you are expecting anything particularly insightful or amusing, you will be disappointed.
