      Juz went to take the test to see how high is my IQ, guess wat IQ score of 126,a Precision Processor. This means I'm exceptionally good at discovering quick solutions to problems, especially ones that involve math or logic. I'm also resourceful and able to think on my feet.   Crap right? For those who knows me well enough will noe that tis description is juz crap. Should not waste my time even to take this test!  Happy day for me , went out wif Marlina to Orchard Road and jalan jalan ,from noon to night ,so fun!!!And somemore talk about lots of things eg. "someone", alvin,eric,andrew... Hehe, tell u a secret , guess wat's my first impression of alvin? cute and childish but after talking to Marlina bout alvin, i find him a sweet guy, hope to find a bro like alvin...  But come home , went to see "someone's" blog , then totally break down, totally have no idea to choose which suitable words to describe my feelings now!!! haiz Sorry hor, very longwinded and naggy right but i just needed someplace where i can juz pour out all my troubles!  Haha those who truly knows me well enough should noe who is the someone right?

      these few days, my mood swings very fast...u c me extremely happy & in a moment in an extremely bad mood...all thanks to "him" who made my life miserable these few days and he seemed to show no expressions...this goes to show my place in his heart..."3yrs daughter & father " and it ended up in this state, who should i blame? myself?...i been avoiding him when i saw him...one he seemed that he wanted to talk to me but i avoided him ...how...i juz blabbed ubbish to zaki and make myself looked engrossed haha... so funny... when we got our results in sec 3 & knew we were be in different class ...mummy actually had already warned me that we will become further ...i juz laughed it off , cos i had faith in him and knew he would not do that to me hence i tried to keep him by my side ,calling him "daddy" thinking he will then always be my frenz but who noes he dashed my hopes and from a high place...I remember once,Mrs Choong asked me how are we (me & "daddy"), i recalled that time i answered so confidently we r still very good frenz but if the same qn was to be ask to me again, i have totally no idea how to ans...all i can do is cry...keeps on crying till i die?
