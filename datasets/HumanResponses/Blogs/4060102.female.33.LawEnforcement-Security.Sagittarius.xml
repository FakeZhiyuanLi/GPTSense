       Margie Camel and Johnnie Lee Richardson had nine children who survived to adulthood. They are.    Walter J. Richardson   Johnny J. Richardson   John L. "Bert" Richardson   Carl Richardson   Maggie Richardson   Gloria Richardson   Lucille Richardson   Dorothy Richardson   Easter Richardson       These nine are the branches from which our family tree will be established.  Most are still alive.  Two are deceased.  They have children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  They have history, knowledge and wisdom to share and pass down to the next generation and generations that are to come.  It is from these nine that we will discover, record, and preserve our history .

      Margie Lee Camel Was born in Columbus Mississippi to Doc Camel and Magnolia Camel.  Little is known about Doc and Magnolia except that Magnolia was a full blooded native american.  (possibly cherokee)  Margie was born on July 12, 1916.  She married a muscian named Johnnie Richardson at a young age and eventually gave birth to 11 children; four boys and seven girls.  Sometime after the birth of these children, her husband abandoned the family.  Margie had one leg shorter than the other. It is unclear whether she was born with this condition or if she was somehow injured in childhood.  Whatever the case, she walked with a limp which made it very difficult for her to find employment.  After her husband left her she began drinking.  The unemployment, the lack of opportunity and especially the alcoholism made properly caring for her children very difficult.  But somehow she managed to raise her children.  One of her daughters (Sarah) died in adolescence and another (Mildred) died as an infant(more on that later)  but the rest all made it to adulthood.   Margie accepted Jesus as her Lord and personal savior later in life and was eventually made a church mother of 15th Street Church of God in Christ.  She died on Saturday March 25, 1995 and was buried at Union Cemetary in Columbus, MS.  In addition to her children, Margie also had over Twenty-seven grandchildren and ovre Twenty-five great-grandchildren.

      Johnnie Lee Richardson (son of Walter, grandson of John) was born in 1917 in Columbus, MS.  He married Margie Lee Camel and together they gave birth to 10 children.  Johnnie was a muscian at heart and could play the piano with a talent so refined it could only be called "gifted."  He played with a blues band called the "Rhythm Kings."  They performed mostly for white audiences who would fill up clubs and restaurants to hear the music.  They also perfomed for the soldiers during WWII in Prairie, Mississippi.  There is a picture of one of these perfomances on file.   But the story is not a happy one.  Maybe it was the call of the music.  Maybe  it was the pressures of fatherhood.  Maybe it was the strain of living in abject poverty or the pain that comes from unfulfilled dreams.  Whatever the reason, one morning in the mid 1940's Johnnie told his family he was going to the store.  It would be about 20 years before any of his children would see him again.  It is known that he continued to play music and travel with the band. What is not known is why he chose to leave and not contact his family for such a long time.  He retired and moved to Boston Massachutes somtime in the 1970's. He renewed contact with his children but  by that time they were all adults and most were very resentful of him.  He died in the 1980's in Boston, Mass.  Some of his children chose to attend his funeral.  Others did not.  He is not often spoken of within the family and even to this day the conversation is still  "uncomfortable " whenever he is discussed.

      Walter Richardson (the first one) was the son of John and Hester Richardson.  He had one brother, Burt Richardson.  And was married twice.  His first marriage was to Lucille Mosley who was said to have become a great evangelist during the period following her marriage.  Lucille and Walter had one child named Johnnie Lee Richardson born in 1917.  He later married Annie Laurie Howard who was the first black woman business owner in Columbus, Mississippi.  She owned and operated Annie Laurie's Beauty School. The first one of its type that trained black women how to become cosmotologists.  She lived to be 101 years old and died on October 9, 1999 (coincidentally the same day I was married.)  Walter and Annie never had children together.   Walter was called a "red-bone."  He had a fiery temper and bluish colored eyes that would often change to grey depending on his mood.  His unpredictable temper and the wierd eye color earned him the name of "wolf."  His grandchildren can recall visiting him and his wife and not knowing whether Grandpa Walter would greet them with open arms or chase them away.

      John Richardson is probably the oldest Richardson on whom I have a definite evidence that he was an ancestor. He was born in 1869 possibly in Pickens County Alabama and died in 1934 John was married to Hester Richardson 1868-1939. Very little is known about Hester except that she lived her life with John. If these dates can be verified I will change the information. They are both also buried in Union cemetary in Columbus. There is a Bert Richardson buried next to John and Hester. His lifespan is 12/5/1889 - 2/1928.

      This blog is to post any information found during my research into my family history. I have searched census records, phone books and just about anything else I can get my hands on from Lowndes County Mississippi and Pickens County Alabama, the two places I am SURE our family comes from. Since I was born and raised in Columbus, Lowndes County Mississippi and more of our family has lived here than in any other place, Columbus in Lowndes County Mississippi will hereafter forever be known as the "Official Homebase of the Richardson Family." The one thing I have learned from all of my research so far is that I am going to need the help of all of my relatives. I need to know what they know, who they remember, how far back can they remember, what stories have been passed on from their parents and grands, and most importantly what do they remember. Once I have enough information, I intend to copy it for the official family records and also to file a copy in the public library. I want the family history to live on and be passed on to our children and their children. We have lost so much, I don't want any other generations to lose anything else.
