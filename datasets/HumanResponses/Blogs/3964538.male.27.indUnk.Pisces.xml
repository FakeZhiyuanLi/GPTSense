      ok im like seriously freaking out right now and worried to holy hell...torri just signed on and i sent her a message then i got a responce back that this isnt torri...it was her best friend steven and siad he didnt know where torri was and that she wasnt answering her cell phone and that her brother was over there too he asked if i talked to her today which i hadnt and asked when i talked to her last... so needless to say i am thinking the worst right now and having a horrid feeling in my stomach...cause when i talked to her last nite she said she would be back in 30 to 45 mins and never came back...which is not like her... so of course all the worst possibilites are running thru my head right now and god i do not like this...im left sitting here feeling helpless...i told steven he has got me worried and to please let me know something but then he signed off.. god this sucks..im just hoping she went out drinking and got drunk and is just sleeping it off.. ok so i really cant type anymore cuase i just cant think straight and am too damn worried..so all i can do is sit here and hope and pray nothing is wrong..but the worst things wont leave my mind ok i gott go hopefuly i will hear something soon...

      so ok i meant to do this the other day but i never got around to it...my apt is looking shitty now cause of having boxes and shit everywhere...so anywyas besides the moving crap ive been in like the best freaking mood since thursday...hell yesterday at work i was in such a good mood i was hyper as hell like a kid with ADD who instead of taken his ridelin took some speed would sum up how hyper i was...for anyone who knows me knows i go into voices everynow and then... some say im talented and others have said its childish and inmature...well i can think of one that did that was chick i was dating and when she broke up wiht me she went off on me for doing voices and acting silly and cutting up...sorry im not a bump on the log and i try to enjoy myself and make others laugh hell look how much money is in entertainment...will ferral is a big goofball and he is making a couple mill a film now...so FU cause i enjoy life and dont have a pole up my ass... really pisses me off when i think back about that cuase she also told me that i had no direction and i wasnt going anywhere...i was like what the helll....ya i didnt finish school cause i got hired to do my dream job...i was happy as hell wiht my job and moving up...but yet i had no goals and directions...i guess cause she had her college degree and was a manager at abercrombie...i job she hated and bitch about she doing better wiht her life...nope dont think so i was working less hours than her pulling in more money than her and i was happy wiht my job... wow off subject but that just kinda pissed me off thinking back on it...so HAPPY MOOD that is me...after the last time i talked to torri my mood was anything but happy...it was like everything was crashing down on me..i believed i touched on som of what happend in the last post so wont rehash... so on thursday her and i chatted and it started off slow and that made me worry but then we started talking about the previous nite saying we were sorry and then we pretty much had one of the best nites...i mean it was amazing...only word to discribe it.. i was making faces blowing her kisses...and then we just started talking about a mix tape...whcih was wierd cause she had made  alist of songs to be on it that day...i had thought about making one also and it had a lot of the same songs... kinnda freaky....well it gets betetr earlier in the day i tried to win tickets for the cheap trick good charlotte show and i was caler 12 my fav number... normaly i dont even get thru...well earlier that day torri called to win incubus tix and she was caller 8 her fav number and only one caller away from winning...ok im serrriously starting to freak out over here cause that is some  like voodo shit or smething...so the rest of the nite we tried to stump each other wiht songs she got me some i got her some but damn the girl is good... i even played her some guitar... i mean wierd to say....ok wierd must be the word for the day on pee wees playhouse cause im using it alot...so quit yelling everytime i say it chariy...lol i loved that show...so wierd  (YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) becuase i have never felt this feeling before i serriously felt like she was right there wiht me and we were just hanging out listening to music... so ya it just put me int he best mood and even on saturday im still hyper about it...friday we talked and it was great then she left and siad she would be back in 30  but after couple hours i gave up figured she ended up at some party or somehing... but ok im dozing back off ya im a lazy bastard maybe a shower will wake my ass up...if not it will at least make me smell better...not that i smell bad i just got that deodarant is wearing off been in bed all day funk about me...ya shower would be good...food would rock too im starved last nite i had some of the thai noodles vince gave me i had had this kind before but they didnt bother me for soem reason this time it was so damn spicy i shit you not my lips were numb and spicy feeling an hour later...ya and my dumb non grocery shopping ass was out of drinks so i had to drink nasty water.....so ok so now im going to go take a shower gets some food..fast food i guess or mm waffle house...hell i dont know just food... maybe someone will wnat to grab something since vince is getting some pho right now and caleld to tell me and rub it in...asshole could have called me earlier and asked me...hell he may have but i was sleeping and had like 4 missed calls from mom that crazy cracker... oh ya one more thing here is the geek and dork in me...i was pissed cauyse i watched a lil movie thing that siad the next star wars was going to be called the return of darth vader...which sounds crappy for one...and makes no fucking sense since this movie is how he becomes darth vader...well like it matters what i think but i didnt like it and lucas was seriously about to be on my bad side even mor,,,lucas is cool but i got many bones to pick wiht him...so it was announced earlier this week and i forgot to talk about it then so im talking about it now the new movie will be called revenge of the sith...ok lucas ya got some points back good title...lets just hope this movie is darker and not so much for the kids...ok serriously im endinmg this right about here so peace love and haitr grease im out

      today ahs just been god awful...serriously i could cry right now if i thought about everything... so why not relive the shitty day by typing about it ...so i woke up late today...i was supposed to call yvone this morning to make sure she was awake as she had 3 midterms today and last nite she was up late and casey broke up wiht her so she wasnt in the best of moods...what a shitty time to break up wiht someone... i rank it there along wiht vince going to miami to get dummped on his birthday when she told him she had decided it 2 weeks earlier..so after his flight down to see her and spending the whole weeknd she dumped him...but it was the best thing for him... he is much happier now...  so he waitied till at nite to break up wiht her when she had midterms the next moring... but it was the best thign for her she was always upset...but i wont doubt that they get back together its happend before but she seems to really know its for the best this time so its wierd cause i feel bad for her cause after being with someone for so long even if its not been great for awhile and ya know its the best thing ti still hurts... but i am also happy for her if it is finaly over this time cause she wont be going thru the ups and downs like she was which hurt her also...so anywyas when i called her 30 mins later then when i was supposed to she was already up and ready...so thanks god she did wake up.... then on the way to work im sitting at a red light and the guy behind me decieds he wants to back up and get into the toher lane... needless to say my car was in his way... but ya know what it sucked but hey im not hurt niethr was he its just a car...hell i didnt get mad...he was a nice guy and kept saying how sorry he was and how he could be so stupid...but my car was hit ina  parking lot awhile back and the asshole left and i nver got it fixed cause wasnt worth it to submit after the detucible so now it will get fixed along wiht someother things that need to be and i wont have to pay a cent thanks to ray knows the owner of the body shop... so fingers crossed it will all get fixed.. so i have been extremely lonely and down ... ya i have torri inb my life and she is wonderful and i love her to death... and i love the time we spend together chatting... but ive just been craving her by myside so much its just making me lonely and down cause god how much her hug or kiss hell even her prescence would lift me up... im not a depressed person...ya i watch some romantic chick flick and i go awh i hope to have that one day... and maybe it was going to the wedding this weekend cause i was happy as hell for them but inside i was like god im jealous...cant wait for my turn...ya i know chessy right well cant help it im a big softie... i have so much to give and ive found the person i want to give my heart too... god never in a million years did i think id meet someone like torri... i mean all i ever said or day dreamed about that i wanted in a  woman she has it... so ive been patient...cause hell i got time and becuase she is so worth it... but today for some reason i was just dying for a hugg.. i mena nothing can explain it i just needed a hug... funny how something so lil could have made a world of difference... i mena i guess i could have got one from vince when he was here but we were in workout clothes and that would have been a lil gay...love him he is my boy but nawh hugg from him wouldnt have been what i needed.. hell there are two people that could have given me a hug today and just made me on top of the world... one being torri and the other my mom... but nietehr one was around for em to wrap my arms around... so needless to say torri and i were talking earlier when i got home and that made me feel so much betetr... then all of a sudden ater i made a joke about planning the wreck so she would have dinner with me so i could get a hug she got quiet and quit talking... so then vince showed up i went to work out then went to my parents to feed the cats and when i got back torri was online and we chatted but she was real short and distance...sure she mayhave been chatting wiht other friend or  playing pool or chess...whcih she kicks ass in...i have the bruises to prove it... so not a biggie she wasnt to talkative... i totaly understand that... but i guess cause i was feeling down it made me feel unwanted by the one person i want... so i told her of it and we both said things and i kinnda just poured my heart out about somethings since i was just feeling confussed and like she didnt want me... ok this is hard to explain cause im not going to put down the reason for things cause its between her and me...not like anyone besides torri reads this... but it was like shit h9ow do i put it.. ya know what i wont put it cuase its non of your damn bussiness if i dont know you and ytour readin this lol...just kidding there was a need to be filled and it seemsed she didnt want me to fill that need which hurt... but liek i said ive been kinnda down and i could have taken things the wrong way whcih i think i did was just the vibe i got and im the type that feels ytou should be open and honest in arelationship and i mentioned it and other thigns... but i did upset her whcih god kills me cause thats the last thing i want... but im upset to so she went to lay down and clear ehr head while i sat here all misty eyed...but she siad she loved me before she left and god...did every once of sadnness and downness...downess is that aword well if not it is now...it all went away... its cause i was needing the warmth and caring she has so badly tontie.. maybe i should have mnentioned that earleir to her so she would have understood where iw as comming from...who knows all i know is that my stomach was knots...i know she loves me and cares for me...i dont doubt that at all... its just it is starting to get kinnda hard for me to be able to hugg her is all...just have to be patient since it wont be long... she was talking about sometime next week... i hope thats able to happen but if not then hopefully soon...so anywyas the cap of a crappy day her and i got ina lil tift just caudse im in need of a hugg pretty much... so ya i feel like an ass.. cause i made a big deal out of nothing... so fingers crossed things will be fine next time we talk...hmmm i feel betetr now that i typed this....wow... so quick wrap up..woke up late when i was supposed to call yvone and wake her up and then my car got hit then torri and i had a wierd nite..which we never really had one like that so it was on me cause i let something get to me that i normaly wouldnt have just cause i need a hug... ya im a dork and a softie but damn id kill for that hug... mom will be home tommorw so maybe ill go over and chat wiht her and get some homemade cooking!!! so now im going to think of happy thoughts...( that would be torri) and try to have sweet dreams of what i day dream about..but ill be falling asleep while watching hell boy so hopefuly i wont dream of monsters under my bed...hmmm maybe leave the nite lite on just in case..where are my under roos??? no not that batman ones i want the spiderman ones there ya go..hmm dont fit like they used to oh well... damn of subject but that just made me think of the tom hanks movie big... damn i loved that movie i need to get it on dvd god cant believe i dont already have it...ok before i get hyper cause im thinking of torri im going to cut this long thing short..ok let me also say thanks for smoking crack when i was in yyour womb mom... cause ya had to cause im making no sense... wow scary thought my mom smoking crack..errr what was i saying oh ya.. i was trying to wrap this up.. bottom line is im lonely and miss the hell out of torri and in desperate need of a hugg...anbd now i realize why i was earleir and let things get to me that i shouldnt  have so maybe she will read this and understand..or maybe she will be like you still have under roos and your mom smoked crack... what the hell was i thinking see ya... now that i think of it maybe i should go and take that stuff out... nawh she knows im kidding..  so ya its been hard for me esp this past weekend and since then not having her in my arms and i finaly let it get the best of me today...err i ahte that cause im up front about stuff cuase ya have to be open and not hold back ina  reltaionshp... but i just think i went the wrong way about it...hopefuly she will understand and forgive me and things will be fine between us... i dont see things not being fine between us over this but who knows.. all i know is i love her she loves me and im going to quit tyoping beofre i get carpel so peace love and hair grease immmm hold on i havent put a pic up for awhiel so let me find one ok got it... so once again i love ya tor and im sorry about earlier...peace love and hair grease im out

      ok so today was kinnda shitty...my mood was dark and gloomy just like the weather outside...but then the sun finaly came out right before i left work...so that made me smile kinnda took it as foreshadowing...so torri and i talked tonite...it went very well... i kept teasing her about us grabbing some dinner since i hadnt had anything to eat...although i was teasing ehr i was serious too...tryed to break her down and i think it was working....lol... but oh well i would have loved to but was so last min...hell last second actualy... but needless to say it was great talking to her... and it looks like our date is going to be next week...fingers crossed...unfortunatly we wont be able to go to the korn linkin park show cuase she is still new at her job and unable to get off for it...not a big deal there will be many more concerts we will get to go to... chris and i were talking and both of us have been lazy and need to get busy since it wont be long till i have to move so he needs to get the room cleaned and i need to start packing more... i feel bad cause eric and kelly were in town and called tonite wanting to hang out i was supposed to call them back after i got dressed but i never did...but eric has not called me back several times so shouldnt be a biggie plus he is moving back so there will be more chances to hang out since he wont be in another state anymore....plus they had no idea of what they wanted to do... i enjoyed being at home talking to torri anyways....ugh ok my nose is all clogged up... feel like i have some huge green aliens in my nose....so the chapelle show is on the episode wiht wayne brady...damn this is some funny shit i love this show... i cant wiat for season 2 dvd and the new 3rd season to start airing...ive been a fan of chapelle way before he got the show...i was lucky enough to go see him perform stand up before he got real big...cost me 5 bucks...last month when he was in town it was like 75 a ticket.. so not much else...well crap i forgot to publish this and just saw it so im back to bed peace love and hair grease im out

      so ok tonite was a lil different...i thought i had figured out what was bothering me earlier that it was the crap yvone was going thru but turned out to be a combo of that and what i had feared when i first got the feeling that it had to do wiht torri...she told me earlier in the nite she had a crazy weekend and that her ex came into town...that kinnda shocked me...and made me go hmmm this doesnt sound good but that was all she really told me that he came in town and they hung out and got to talk alot...well she siad she was updating her journal so later in the nite i read it and my stomach just dropped to the floor... i wont go into detials... but from what she wrote he was pursuing her hard...and she was avoiding the subject... but ya so he kissed her stomach and made other comments...and he had been told about me by gabe and pretty much siad it was stupid for her to being talking to me...so i took the whole thing as being she was seriousl considering getting back wiht him...but she says ity was just that what he said made her think about her and me...she says nothng happend.. and still wants to be with me... so needless to say im confused as hell right now i think things are ok wiht us... but im not sure since we didnt get to finish talkin as she signed off...so ya i guess thigns are ok wiht her and i...just whooo ya...i dont know...i know i care for her and i know she cares for me...so guess ill just have to wait and see what happens next not much i can do...hopefuly there wont be any doubts on her mind or mine after the date...so i think im just going to go to bed tommorow is a different daylol THE SUN WILL COME OUT TOMMOROW BET YOUR BOTTOM... sorry i normaly dont bust out in to musicals...but ya got to admit ya loved annie when ya were lil so to sum up no rants tonite cause not in the mood not sure what kind of mood im in im just HMMMMMMM so not sure whatelse to say...that doesnt happen to often lol so peace love and hair grease im out

      ok so ya im still a lil drunk.. i had ummm hold one let me try to count... maybe 12 to 15 beers at the recption tonite... it was pretty fun but part of me really couldnt enjoy myself... ok so basicaly from 330 well hell lets say 4 till 1130 i danced a totaly of ONCE... which kinnda pissed me off...first off i was one of the sharpest dressed at the wedding and the recption... so what the hell no girls could go hey ya want to dance... i had one dance and it was to a country song...one i actualy knew... a nice girl named amy who i happend to be talking to cuase i made fun of her for not dancing when ushers song started playing...this girl besides kristi rays wife was out on the dance floor for the longest amonhg any off the peeeps there... so i was liek ya gotta be kiiding me your not out on the dance floor for one of the hottest dance songs out right now... so needless to say we started talking...yadda yadda yadda... then some country song comes on and noone is on the dance floor and she syas god a song i want to dance to and no one is danceing so she taught me how to do the texas two step... ya i steped on her feet a couple times... ok who am i kidding a lot damn son i got a size 12 to 13 shoe depeniding on who makes the shoe... but we got applause for our dancing well her dancing i can do the twrils and dips no prob but the two step after 8 beers not the lightest on my toes... but was my only time to dance all damn nite...kristi tried to get me to dance with her a couple times but kinnda odd to do that kinnda dancing wiht your best friends wife... so ya one dance and the main reaosn it sucked not that i care if anyone wanted to dance wiht me it 3was the fact that the majority of the songs played by the no talent not knowing how to work equipment...( i was about to go up there and show then how to set the shit up at the beginign of the recption cause they didnt know there ass from a cd) ok that was a long thing so let me catch ya back up since i am drunk ALL THE SONGS WERE SLOW SONGS!!!! well not all but at least 80 percent... so being the hopless romantic i am i just sat there and watched all the couples dance and wished torri could have been wiht me... dont get me wrong im sure i could have grown some balls and asked someone to dance but what the fuck is the point in dancing a slow romantic song wiht someone you dont know and dont care about??? so i just drank more beer and ate more food... so towards the end of the nite i was kinnda in a foul mood and here is that quick story....the nite before chris and i talekd to these two girls all nite long and they were cool or so i thought.... chris really like one and teased me for ever to stay away from her... even though he knew i wouldnt do anything cause of toorri but yet each nite ive been here all i heard was ok she is single she is single let me go introduce ya...and im like no thats ok... only one person was cool and dint try and that was jason i was like dont care and he was like ok i gotcha... everyoneelse was like well technical your still single... ya im still single but damn is everyone trying to get me hooked up and settled dowwn or laid???? so another point of bringing me down...like i cant meet someone on my own if i wanted to.. ya know what i can im not that damn hideous and im a freaking nice guy as long as you dont get on my bad side which takes a hella of a lot to do... so back to chris and these girls...so we talked and everything the nite before...and i tryuly thought hey these are some cool girls and it will be nice to know some more people at the wedding the next day.... well needless to say when chris went over to say hey and sit down next to them at the wedding these itches acted liek they had no clue who he was... i kinnda hung back for awhiel and taked to kristi... then i went and sat down by them and i got ignored too...ok helllllll nawh... first off i was looking damn good and have pics to prove it if ya dont believe the hype but mainly i am not going to sit back and watch a close friend get treated liek that... chris is over wieght and not a calvin klien model and he will tell you he is not but he is one hell of a guy and any girl would be lucky to have him as a friend let alone a bf....but he want trying to hookup he just wanted to chat wiht some cute girls that we had a fun chatting with the nite before....so the girls ended up moving away from him...wtf??!?! so he continued to sit there i on the other hand sat clsoe to the back of the cruch so i could get good pics and cause i saw what was going down... so later at the recption they did the same thing to him and when he asked if they were going to stay till the end both had a differant story when he knew they rode togetrh and both siad somethign differant in front of each other and then were like oh shit lets get our story straight... so chris after several beers told me and another guy about it and was like screw it ya know i was just trying to be friendly those bitches and shit like that... well less than a couple hours later i go out sides and what do i see but chris sitting at a table with the two girls like everything was fine... chris and none of my friends deserve to be treated like that and to see him sitting there pissed me off... then whiel standing back and observing i watch chris get up and go get them drinks?!?!?!?... needless to say that blew my fuse and i just walked off an sat down and looked at the moon and stars and thought of how badly i wished torri was there cause all i heard was slow dance songs...no 311 love song...that might have made it worse but anywyas the weeding was great ya i cried and if ya gotta a problem with it blow it out your ass... on my drive back to the htoel i rode with kristi and her and i had a good talk best we have ever had.... so i am real glad about that so she now knows when she is having problems with ray she has someone to call..not that ray is bad but he has changed a lot since he got married... but i toldher how hey ya have problems and arguements it comes with being togetrh... it cant be perfect bt i told her like jason and charlotte her and ray had it great and that i was jealousy of that cause i havent had that... you can look at ray when he is around kristi and see the love he has for her and the love she has for him...same with jason and charlotte...so ya ima  big softie i talk a ton of shit but ya deep down inside ima softie and i cried at teh wedding...so to sum the nite up ltos of beer one dance with an older chick who i steped on her feet...oh also iwas giving a great complimant by  a lady who did the video of how i should be a movie star or in entertainment of some sorts because i was very talented and i just met her yesterday...so that made me feel real good that someone actualy besides my parents and ray appreciate my talnets...juvenile as they amy to some...so that despite the bitches chris talked to who i didnt speak but one word to all nite and it was because one siad oh ya changed once i got out of my pmp clothes in to some shorts an tshirt and my responce was yup...then mumbled bitch...ok what was i talking about?...oh summing up the nite... happy as hell for jason and charlotte 2 years of being married and finaly a wedding and recption her parents and family were wonderful.... i cried at the wedding...chris and i met some biotches he contineued to talk to them after they turned out to be bitches... i ahd one dance the wole nite thanks to amy teaching me how to 2 step and letting me step on her feet...but she said i kicked asss on the twirls and dip[s and was surprised...well of course i can slow dance the nite away ima  romatic ya gott know that shit to be one countrydanceing is like a foreing language to me... idrank a lot of beer... iwas complinted on my talnets by a sweet lady from detroit...whose husband cracked me up cause he was watsed every min i saw him... and i really fucking missed torri thank god i didnt hear love song... so all an all was an ok nite...could have been betetr but hey jason and charlote were happy and thats all that realy matters to me when ya get down to the bottom of the keg...ya should be bottom line but this has been a weekend of drinking and tomorrow will be no differant...so as the majority of the people all weeknd long have yelled...GO WAR EAGALES!!!!...and my lil go dawgs woof woof woof thrwon in after..oh i know how could he do it... heyt im an auburn and uga fan i just happend to go to uga cause of scholoarship reasons...but as a compromise i have been wearing my auburn hat that i have had since middle school...ok im rambling and my stomach is too cause mcdonalds and beer beer beer dont mix...so GO WAR EAGLES!!!

      well its about 10 and im finaly getting around to fixing something to eat..thought chris and i would go grab some food but he decided not to stop by tonite since he had to hit the stores before they closed...which was fine wiht me cause i was talking to torri so i didnt want to leave really...we ended up playing some pool and she killed me as always..i won a couple but we waggered on some games and those are the ones i lost...but i dont care i just enjoy the time wiht her cause it always puts a smile on my face.. so now im cooking and listening to the new adam sandler cd cause i wanted some laughs.. for some reason im kinnda down... im not really sure why... for some reason ive got this feeling like something bad is going to happen... for some reason its always true when i get this feeling..i never know why i get that feeling...its real wierd... i guess part of why im down is cause of torri... not her fault just i really miss her and want to wrap my arms around her.. my feelings for her are doing nothing but getting stronger...so maybe im just unconsiously trying to protect myself from getting hurt... not that i think she would hurt me... but after being broken hearted its hard to open up to someone your always worried if you open up to someone your just setting yourself to be hurt again.. ive sheltered my heart for a long time and when i started to let some walls down i get hurt again.. so im real nervous about letting them down completly... but how could i not wiht torri... i mean she realy is what i have always wanted... so i guess im also getting anxious about the date.. hell to feel so strong for someone i have yet to be able to wrap my arms around scares the shit out of me...cause ive done what i promised myself id never do again and is just fall for someone so damn quick and hard.. knowing she is only a hour away makes it worse..she is so damn close... the nervousness comes from not knowing what will happen and when it will happen... but i remain patient cause it will happen when she is ready...if it was up to me id be in her arms right now but im here in the apt alone...thank god for my wall of pillows to cuddle and watch movies with lol... but it is frustratiung sometimes but im still understanding...how could i not be...how could anyone not be understanding about someone they care for... so i dont know...dont know what is really bugging me and bringing me down...i guess its like somethings missing  hell i dont know... so now im getting frustrated cause i dont know why i am down... but this bad feeling is a sign of something to come...what i got no clue...wish i could put my finger on it and go AHHHH HAAA there ya are ya lil bastard im going to fix you before you trun out bad for me... well on to better things i mentioned that torri and i waggered on the games of pool...well since i lost i have to wear a tshirt wiht somethign she draws on it...so now im like what the hell is this going to be... so it was cute idea for her to wagger cause now besides having to worry about being nervous and wheter she will like me..which shit am i nervous... i know she is too i think that is one of many reasons things havent happend sooner... i truly think she is affriad of opening up and being hurt just like me...and affriad that on the phone or in person i will think what the hell was i thinking this girl is nuts...which wont happen her personality is why im crazy about her so much liek me... or maybe cause it will cross the line form being just on the net to being more real and affraid then she will start to open up and doesnt want to get hurt... i dont know ive never understood girls if i did id be a multi zillionaire from knowing the secrets of women like mel gibson in that movie...so ive talked to yvone about it before cause she is a girl and knows how they work...lol but she is sworn to the sacred girl oath...what you didnt know abut the girl oath...ok all girls have an oath not to let guys know whats going on... so they can stay a mystery... rememebr back to middle school when we watched those sex ed videos..and we were all watching them togetrh then half way through the guys had to leave...thats when the girl secert oath is signed...well how do i know this cause i did some indian jones style searching... so yvone has been the one to give me advice but she cant give me full insight because of the oath... so she tried to explain reason she thought.. and just told me to be patient but she didnt understand the phone thing which threw me for  a loop cause i figured she would give me insight on that one...but that was also a long time ago when i asked her and i asked torri about it yesterday when she was asking me all the questions which was fun as hell... cuase it was a great convo..she says it cause she is silly and is nervous i will be like what the hell is this girl on crack...even though i think id would make us so much closer to talk on the phone.. so ill just wait for her to call.. im always a big believer of if things are meant to be they will be ya cant force shit so that and out of respect for torri i havent tried to push shit..well i kinnda have but not really... maybe i should i kinnda try but then back down.. well hopefuly there wont be too many more of these shitty nites alone wiht out hearing her voice or feeling her touch... so maybe thats what is bothering me just getting anxious about it all since we have been talking for a long time and its now been awhile since she has been back from fla...  i dont know i really dont.. all i know for sure is that i care so much for her and i want her happy...i hope im the one that will make her happy... and she wont be scared of letting me into her heart and will open up to me more and know that ill do nothing but cherish her heart and for her to be as gentle wiht my heart as well...so i really have no clue what i typed here cause i havent even looked up ok im going to go play some guitar and maybe write a song.. sorry for whoever reads this cause its justa  long ramble from my head and heart that probably makes no sence lol so ok no pic from earlier post so i watched starsky and hutch ealier it was aight...worth a watch so i leave you wiht this peace love and hair grease

      so im hoping this text is smaller since im new to this still I realized the text was so huge so hopefully this is better...and I finaly remember how to put images on here as seen on the last post...ok that is a pic of a guy named parade kid the italian elf.... this guy has been on 99x morning show as of late and there is a ton of talk about whether this is a hoax or for real since the guy is crazy funny...  urlLink www.99x.com  to listen to some of the audio... just figured I put that here in case someone happens to read this and thinks that is a pic of me.. so im bored off my ass although one of my favorite shows is on right now JOE SCHMO 2... this has to be the raciest show on tv right now I cant believe the crap they get away with.. one of the only shows on right now that will make me laugh so hard that i cry... so no rants from me this time as im just not in the mood to rant.. my mood is just kind of blagh right now since i haven't talked to Tor for a couple days now.... the last time we talked she was upset about somethings and&nbsp; said bye and just signed off only to come back and give me a sweet good bye... it is hard to know someone you care for is upset and to feel so helpless...im the one who always cheers up my friends whether it be being serious and talking to get them to see the brighter side of things or be it me acting like a&nbsp; fool and making them laugh... so I was left feeling helpless by this I couldn't reach over and give her a hug&nbsp; and hold her I couldn't do anything to make her smile... well anyways I was hoping to hear from her to hopefully get ice cream this past weekend and to find out if she was able to get off work for the linkin park show... so kinda up in the air about the concert ..hope it doesn't sell out...&nbsp; well needless to say im really looking forward to it all the ice cream and concert... getting nervous actually but cant wait regardless... Not butterflies in my stomach more like elephants LOL... I see nothing but good things ahead for her and I... For if some reason it doesn't work out which I don't see happening I know we will be great friends cause she is the type of person that I want in my life not just as a girl friend but as a friend.. thats one of the million reasons im crazy about her... so lets see whatelse I have been trying to get in better shape as I get older I see that it is harder to keep the body up... and im getting frustrated doing ab exercises every day but for some reason the natural abs I used to have aren't there anymore... I used to eat like a pig not gain a pund an had rock hard abs...is this gods cruel joke... just a part of getting older...funny I never really cared about working out and how my body looked when I was younger and now that I do its hard as hell to get where id like it to be.. I am going to start going and getting on the running machine at the gym since I think that I need to have cardio... I don't want to get real old and have health issues cause I wasn't very active.. esp after seeing what jerry just went through with his heart... ok im being sucked into my show so pointless to do anymore since I cant keep my train of thought so here is something to make you laugh the pic below of the cat has a story...the owner of the cat asked for a hair cut for the cat called a Line Cut...she had a bad southern drawl that the groomer thought she said a lion cut... poor cat... peace love and hair grease im out

      ok home from work something on my mind..while eating my wonderful leftovers...no thats not sarcasm...i read the rich snoby folks magazine Atlanta...for those not familar wiht it this is a magaizine that comes out in Ga that caters to the rich and famous that have nothing better to spend their money on...its full of boring article and ads for rolex, yahts, and mansions... it shows pics of all the high dollar fund raisers shit like that... well dotn get me wrong here cause both sets of my parents have money...its just the demo of this magazine is the stuck up rich not the down to earth people...soenough about my rant on the magazine my problem was wiht an article on the very last page...&nbsp; a quote caught my eye as i was skiming over the article and made me read it...the author of the article was telling of the time he took his son to see star wars at the fox...which anytime they show it there its a packed house...when Obi Wan was telling Luke that his fatehr had died in the clone wars the little boy yelled out "LIAR" which made the whole theather crack up with laughter... so i read on thinking this would be a nice father son mishap story...boy was i wrong...this guy had the nerve to write an article on his disapointment wiht his daughters life...she had recently graduated from UGA ...memory doesnt recall what her degree was ...but needless to say she is the lead singer of a band called umptenth or something like that i havent heard them personaly... this asshole of a fatehr was doing nothing but complaining about his daughters choice to be in a band.. he was saying how as parents you shouldnt incourage your kids to chase their dreams... he complained about buying her all these instruments...first off the girl had scholarships so her school was fully paid for.. he was complain that when she played her shows she didnt play the guitar he bought her and that it was a waste of money...just cause she doesnt play it on stage doesnt mean she doesnt use it to write songs at home...hell she has&nbsp; full band behind her she doesnt have to play an instrument... so then he talking about going to one of her shows at Tasty World...first off playing a show at tasty world is a good damn gig...needless to say there was a big crowd and they were in to the band according to him... yet he doesnt think he should have encouraged her to follow her dream of being a musican.... i dont have kids but i know i will be behind them all the way in whatever they decied to do... the girl is going after her dream and is getting it they are on some compilation cd and working on thier own cd...the girl is happy why the hell cant this ass be for her??? she got a degree so if the music doesnt work out she has something to fall back on just cause she isnt out in corporate america being a secertary for some ass like her dad he is disaointed... id have hated to have parents like this...my mom was happy for me when i got my internship and although she didnt care for the regular guys she listend everyday just in case i got on air..she is alwyas more than willing to listen to a new song iv been working on and urge me on to finish it and put words to it... my dad has never been suportive but he was never around so that has somethign to do with it... i feel bad for this girl and anyone else who has parents who obviously want thier kids to have the life the parents&nbsp;want them to have and not the life that makes the kid happy.. i swear ill never be that way if i have kids... what an ass.. be happy for your daughter she got a collge degree probably for you so be happy...she is living her dream and what the hell is wrong wiht that...the world doesnt revolve around you so pull your head out of your ass and be happy and supportive of your daughter not write an article bashing her in a magazine...cause im sure she supports you and reads all your shitty articles...imagine her disapointment and hurt that her fatehr would act like that and throw it out there for everyone to read...ok im doing going off and that ass like he will ever read it...actualy i may email him since i have nothing better to do it seems...&nbsp; so&nbsp; peace , love and hair grease...im out

      so im watching the south park episode where they say shit like 100 times...so the first time I saw this wow it was cool i couldnt believe they got away with it...but since then comedy central has been playing south park the movie uncut which is one of the most foul mouthed movie ever...one reason i love it...but now it makes this episode seem lame..anyways&nbsp; on to more things on my mind from the day... i stayed home pretty much all day other than having breakfast at 2 pm at waffle house and going to buy some crap at ross ya i know i need a gf..fingers crossed TORRI... durring my time at home today i had a headache and watched tv all day...i watched this show on mtv true life or some shit like that...it was about people living double lifes..it was about 3 people but im only going to talk about 2 of them...the first guy had two girl friends one was&nbsp;really cute and you could tell she loved the shit out of him&nbsp;the other not cute at all and the guy ran a porn site and was taking pics of hot girls so im sure he probably hooked up wiht them too...the second guy was gay but he hadnt told all his friends and had his straight nights where he went to bars wiht his friends and picked up hot girls...on other nites he went to the gay bars and hooked up wiht guys.. so this is what pissed me off about this show...neither one of these guys were what id consider a good looking guy...they were avg guys like me...yet ya have one guy wiht 2 gfs?!?!?! WTF... then the gay guy picking up girls at the bar... only once have i ever met someone at a bar and it was because she came after me...ONE TIME...have i been to bars and tried to meet girls hell yeah has it happend hell no...i know im no super model...im an avg looking guy by no means am i ugly and i have a great personality...so what the hell is wrong wiht me where i dont have a gf and i cant pick up girls? not that im out trying now but when i was i had no game..yet a gay guy picked up more girls in the 2 nites they followed him in the bar then i have ever... and i know this is the un guy like thing to say but why does that asshole deserve 2 gfs...one who seemed great and loved him... that bastard he had something great and it wasnt good enough for him he need some ugly slut on the side... and he did this for over a year...then he got mad when he susspected the good girl was seeing someone else too...which she wasnt it was just a guy friend she was hanging out with..so when he told her about the other girl she stayed wiht him!?!?!? lets put it this way when and if torri and i finaly get things started ill be so damn happy ill be damned if im going to be looking at another girl let alone see anyone else...oh by the way the shit count is up to 110 now... so maybe everything is just a test to make me appreciate things more but needless to say this show pissed me off and made me wonder what the hell was wrong wiht me why i am single..anyways maybe it just got to me more cause i havent talked to torri in a couple days and those days always suck for me...which is odd to me...to miss talking to someone and just having thier presence around me...even my closest friends...only child syndrom ive always been fine with being alone...ya i get lonely sometimes but with torri i honestly miss the hell out of her...hopefully that wont be much longer...one more thing ...an appology of sorts... i have always bitched at people for not replacing toliet paper when it runs out or gets low...my step brother was notorious for this... nothing worst then running to the bathroom to sit down and not have any TP... well i pretty much live alone...alica is never here.. but i have my own bathroom... so today was one of those oh my god runnign to the bathroom butt checks clinched tight to sit down and have hardly enough TP to get up a drop of water...so other than vince comming over every now and then...and why does he wait to take a shit when he gets here whats wrong wiht his place...my bathroom is connected to my room for godsake..anywas on the subject of shit i was wrong the shit episode said it 162 times it just went off...so long story short im sorry to everyone ive ever cursed for not replacing the TP since i did it to myself today.. thank god unlike at my parents house the TP isnt a mile away...&nbsp; well i think im going to go jump in the shower since i just got back from working out then i guess it will be bed time more of my rants to come they will get better i promise im new to this...peace love and hair grease&nbsp;  http://images.southparkstudios.com/media/images/503/ep_503_03.gif ">

      so i have finaly got around to doing this...the whole blog craze is over now isnt it...well better late then never... so we will start from where im at right now in my life... well my life right now is actualy not much of a life...ive been kinnda a hermit as of late... there are somethings right now that have me down...first has been having me down for awhile now...my lack of doing what i want to do with my life&nbsp; as far as my job.... ive been out of radio now for 2 years and only till recently have i made an effort to try to get back into the game...and damn is it tough...ive been emailing about every job ive seen open here in atlanta...and i have got not one damn responce back...i have the experience and am a hard worker...hell i even asked ben (roach) who was a real good friend to put in a good word...either he didnt or it didnt help...more likely he didnt cause he is too busy and too smoked out i hardly hear from him which kinnda sucks since he and i were real close...but then he became big star and i got fired and drifted apart...but on a good note i found some of my old air check tapes and after i do this i am going to try to edit them and look up some smaller stations and snail mail my cd out who know maybe it will happen... the other thing that has had me down kinnda sorta its wierd its a high somedays and a low somedays... my love life...anyone who knows me knows ive had the worst luck in the love dept...but life goes on...why its up some days and down others is because i have been talking to this amazing girl from auburn her names torri...she has the greatest personality and no matter how bad of a mood i am in when i gte an instant message or a letter from her i light up for days...ya i siad letters no email...letters...its great so much more personal than a email... well we are supposed to go to the linkin park /korn concert but we are going to meet sometime before that for ice cream... its wierd how im crushing over this chick i havent met...so why am i down some days high the others well i dont gte to talk wiht her all that much...so it makes it hard when im having a bad day or down and missing her company...but i think all that will change soon after the ice cream.... i have a real good feeling about this...her an i are both nervous but im sure that will fade quickly.... but how lucky am i a cool girl i click wiht so well who is amazingly beautiful inside and out...big plus is her likes in movies and music...whcih is a big plus in my book...hell she lieks star wars...a girl who lieks star wars!?!?!? ya and she is hot!?!?!? i didnt think there was a thing...so ive been day dreaming about her and i a lot so that worries me in a way cause ive done so good to try to protect myself from getting hurt and ive let my guard down... so to make a long story short torri is sweet,cool, beautiful and damn near perfect...so god willing it will all work out... i will soon be moving out of my nice luxary apt to move into a small place with one of my best friends chris... my options were limited...as ray is married and moved away...vince is in grad school and cant afford to move out...so my only single friend already has a place although it is real small...plus i will save money on rent..and i will be helping him out at the same time.. next weekend is jason and charlotes wedding...they have been married for a year now but due to their schedule wiht the USAF they couldnt get away to have the wedding for family and friends...so i will be going wiht out a female date...something im used to...so chris will be my date...he better be a gentleman and not think im that easy...LMAO it should be a blast though chris and jenifer broke up so he is looking foward to going to a big party of course...hell vince and mellissa broke up too...which in both cases i think was good for both vince and chris...they were both being held back sort of... ok so thats enough whats going on with me...there are ton of other things liek my step dad having heart problems...my step brother being an ass...but i want these posts to be fun and promise the next one will be i just had to lay some ground first about where im at right now...which i did so ...later

      ya so why not take time in between movies...and my first beer...which is about to be my second...to write some random crap on the web...ya what a loser i am i know...ok so just got done watching one of my fav movies buying the cow...chris had never seen it an i think it is one of the funniest movies ever...its on up there not bad for a movie i bought just for the hell of it...i had never seen it but due to some of the cast i figured what the hell since blockbuster was having a buy 2 get one free deal...that was like almost 2 years ago i think...and i still lvoe this lil gem of a movie i found...so chris is cooking up some ribs...using his top secret homemade bbq sauce....its sommmme good stuff too....so almost 12 and i havent had dinner yet but i am drinking and prolly not a good thing on empty stomach but today was a long rough day and i deserve a beer... i deserve a shower too but ive been so busy until we put the movie in i havent made it there yet but before i go to sleep a shower will be a good thing....ohhhhhh damn the grill was just started and the hickory chips smelll soooooo goood...hell anything would be good to eat right about now but tontie will be a treat since chris is a hell of a cook...so next movie is super troopers which chris hasnt seen either we both decided we need some comedy tonite so anywyas....ok i say that too much i must have some like califonia valley girl in me or something...so anyw...shit i almost did it again...ok so ya main thing is i miss the hell out of tor she has tomorrow off and i wish i was spending it with her but ive got mroe cleaning and moving to do :(...ok i need to get cable run in my room cause chris flips channels way to damn much i think i may have a seizure...plus  once i get cable in the room i can start the network finaly have the net back on my cpus which is killing me not to have...i  hvaent been able to download music or play quake 3... hell maybe its a good thing ill actualy get shit done...so i got a frame that will hold my bad ass yoda that torri drew for me... it is going to be hung up tonite before i go to bed...so i hurt my hand moving shit this week and its killing me to type yet i emailed torri and put up two posts now... so i think i need to rehab my hand wiht some more beer...ya that sounds like a plan...so heyummm ok i forgot what i was going to say...hey its W isnt election year great...thank god this year is not totaly overun wiht politcal ads...hell i like commercials but poltical ads i cant stand... so who ya think is going to win W or kerry...my money is on W...ya i call him W cause george and i are tight like that...lol i dont know im not big in to the whole election crap...i mena i know its a good thing we have it and id ahte to live somewhere where we didnt have a choice...to live in america we are fortunate...but i just dont trust most poloticans... and i definetly dont trust kerry...he flips his stance everytime i hear him talk...so ya ive always liked bush...there are some things i dont like but ya have that with every president but i feel he is doing a good job...maybe the war could have been betetr plannned...well not so much the war but the strategy after but hey its war bad things happen cant be perfect... but to liberate iraq was the right thing to do...i dont care wheter your a republican or democrate or a libertarian....how could you say sadam should still be in power...he was a ruthless dictator and was torturing and murdering his own people... oh but we shouldnt put our nose in ohter countrys bussiness we arent the police bush is just a bully on a power trip... well hey the un is the police force of the world...and we are apart of the UN and the strongets most advanced so ya we are the police of the world and we cant stand by and let bad things happen esp when our lifes are in danger...cause sadam had weapons of mass destruction but funny when they find stuff that would somehow make bush looks good its not front page news its in a small article in the back...ok since im on my soap box...which is odd cause this crap really has no affect on me personaly...at least what i mean is polotics dont rile me up like most people... but this is somethign that does...when i hear these democrats and these hollywood asses like michael moore.. damn i could write a book aon that asshole...he is justa  self  promotion machine his works are nothing but propaganda...but hey he has the right to do a film on what he wants...but his film is far from being a doucmentary...but i value freedom of speech so let him do his thing im smart and educated enough not to be sucked into propaganda....ok my point was people like moore and democrats blamming bush for osma....WTF...it wasnt bushs fault for 9/11 he hadnt been in office for that long the blame falls on the president before him who know what bin laden was up to on planning a attack on US soil...and when he had a chance to do something he did not a damn thing cause he was to busy smoking cigars that monica lewinsky used for pleasure... so ok holy shit i cant belive i just went on about poltics...i must really have a hair up my ass or something so thank god the ribs are done so im going to go eat and drink some more beer...think its going to be a late nite...so peace love and hair grease im out

      so today i took my car to the body shop..my step dad also was droping off his truck funny how we both got our vechicles smashed when we were sitting dead still...funnier still is how the people that hit us both have the same insurance company...so we decided to meet at the same time this morning at the shop to drop my car and his truck off...so we drop them off and the guy from the rental car company picks us up to take us to fill out paper work...keep in mind that the rental is paid for by the insurance company which is the same in both cases...jerry has an old ford ranger which is a small truck nothing fancy about it.his rental car was a brand new dodge ram fully loaded...so im like niccccccce..well the rental place gives you a car similar to what you drive when you deal with insurance companys... hope that makes sence hopefuly your smart enough to read and get on the net so it should...so i drive a nice lil sports car so im thinking hmm maybe ill get a mustang or an eclipse since he got the ram fully loaded...OK DAMNIT I WATCH ONE SHOW ON MONDAY NITE AND THAT CHANNEL JUST WENT OUT DURRIGN A BIG MATCH>>>GOD IM PISSED...every other channel works fine but i dont want to watch the other shit on i want to watch wrestling damnit...ya i have a thing for half naked men grabbing each other...oh ya i know its fake damn son welcome to 2004 just cause i watch it doesnt mean i have two teeth and a elementray school education...OK OK back to what i was talking about...so im sitting there wondering what kinnda of cool car ill get to drive for a week as im begging to look for new cars....so after sitting there for awhile and after jerry rolled of in the dodge ram i ask the guy what kind of car will i be getting???...he looks out in the parking lot and goes see that red car...so my mind goes oh red car niccccce...but as i turn to look what do i see him pointing at but a CHEVY CAVILER!?>!??!?!?! WTF....jerry gets a nice new ram when he drives a old ranger my SPORTS CAR transfers over to an 8 grand piece of shit for my rental...thank god im not trying to pick any girls up or have any dates cuase damn id be in sad shape...not that all girls are shallow but lets face it...come on its a caviler!?!?!? no power anything!!!...so needless to say im pissed about having this crap mobile for a couple weeks while mine gets fixed..OKOKOK back to the tv i just got off the phone wiht the cable company they dont know why the channel is out...the head tech is comming in to look at it but by the time he gets there my show will be over it just better be fixed by tommorws joe schmo2 finale...ok so ya no smokes makes jimmy very irratible... i havent talked to torri for a couple days and im confussed as hell as to what is going on... as much as i care for her im seriously beging to wonder about things there since she isnt telling me anything...think ive been more than patient about everything..so we will see what will happen there soon hopefully...on a good note!!! yvone will be in town next week...she will be here for 3 weeks so im stoked as hell about getting to hang out wiht her...i may go out to texas for a long weekend later this year to hang out wiht her some...blue collar show is kinda funny...hell they film it here in atlanta at the alliance theather hell i didnt know that i might try to go see that...anyone else want to go???..ya i forget what a date is...well maybe yvone and i can catch it when she is in town...lol ok now i feel like the loser kid going out wiht his sister cause he couldnt get a date...cause although every guy will be checking her out...why she is so down on her appearance i dont know but she is like a sister to me...so that seems to be the closet thing to a date i will have until things finaly work out with torri... ok my channel is still not up...not smoking sucks...my rental car sucks...moving sucks... cable company sucks... not having torri in my arms sucks... so damn the man for holding a brother down...peace love and hair grease im out
