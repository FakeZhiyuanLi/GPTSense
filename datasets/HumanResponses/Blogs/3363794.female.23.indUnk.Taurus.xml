      two words to the wise: wine drunk.  that's right, wine drunk.  it's great.  it's hip, it's the power trip, man, you gotta try it.  forget your woes, forget the blues, forget the CEO on your ass, just grab a bottle and down the hatch.  then watch a creepy movie, with a friend who falls asleep, so you're left in the middle of something you can't really clear from your head.    yeah, i'm a little crazy, but fuck you, you don't read this!  i can say whatever i want!  and the CARNIVORE doesn't care, because they know i'm just a blonde little nobody.  puh-lease, throw me a bone!  speaking of crazy, i forgot to take the crazy pill today, that must mean even more craziness!  come over to my place, and eat a banana, and watch CSI and hang out with my cat, because that's what i do.  rain or shine.  shitfan or plain mist.  until tuesday, the 25th.    so here's one for you.  a man walks onto a street.  a pedestrian street.  and starts to paint, the most amazing things you've ever seen.  is he an artist?  or a vagrant?  what do you do, treat him like raphael?  probably not.  you probably look at him and think, "poor fucker, why can't he get a real job?"   pathetic you.  you lose, game over, you're out of quarters.

      online diaries, how ironic.  don't expect to read my deepest darkest secrets on here, i would never go that far.  i'm doing this because i'm bored, i'm jumping on the blogger bandwagon, so many of my friends, and sister, have one.  i'm bored, and wanted to leave a comment on newman's blog spot, and couldn't do that unless I signed up, so, "fuck it" i said, it's 2:30 in the morning and i've got nothing better to do than sleep and bother my cat.    so, i graduated saturday, hurrah for me!  it was exciting, and then i came home, all my family departed, and i slept like the dead until 4pm today.  now to prepare for the next step, going to washington, d.c.  yeah, i'm partaking in the great intern experience.  i wonder if i'm gonna have to take out my piercings? hmm...all summer will be spent in the capitol.  after that, round and round and round she goes where she lands or ends up no one really knows for sure.  i damn well better be in grad school by fall 2005, so if you have any suggestions on where to do grad studies in virology just let me know...  but for now, i'm going to go share my deep dark secrets with myself.   au reviore or however the fuck you spell it....

      I always have a good time reading Nick's blog.  Hearing the stories about him and women.  Sometimes I wonder how he hasn't been punched in the face yet.  I know I've wanted to do that a few times.  But I have to appreciate the way he torments the girls who deserve tormenting.  (That's an understatement.  I'm mean, and I LOVE stupid girl bashing) I miss you nick!  I've wasted yet another day at work.  It is beautiful outside, it's not even hot, but it is warm, and sunny, and gorgeous, and there are squirrels and happy people and puppies...and i get to stay in this stupid little room.  Se la vie.  Hedish you'd better be reading this.  Maybe this weekend i'll have some stories to tell.

      haha, i'm a paranoid idiot.  pretty much right after my last bitch session, guess who calls?  you've got it, the guy.  i wasn't stood up, i haven't been emmitting man repellent after all.    so, friday night was great!  we went to the date party, at this club in D.C. called H2O.  totally not my kind of place, but it was a lot of fun.  i met many different people.  all single and lonely.  i did cheat, by bringing a date to a single's date party, but i don't care.  it wouldn't have been as much fun!  even more fun ensued afterwards ;)~  saturday i hung out with julie, michelle and tommy.  we had a slumber party.  tommy really likes running around in his TINY boxer briefs, and it scares julie and michelle's other roommate.  she gets pissed off every time.  i just think it's funny.  hey, at least he was vacuuming!  my ass feels like it's going to fall off of my body.  i worked out yesterday, for the first time in months.  OUCH  now, i'm at work, where i refuse to lick 200 something envelopes.  where's the fucking sponge?!?

      the telephone is a blight to my worrying side.   so, i met a guy a couple of weeks ago.  we've planned to go out TOMORROW, and i haven't talked to him since last wednesday.  my pessimism and inmy realism is telling me he won't call, and i'll be flying solo yet again.  let's see, he'll count for #4 since march, of Men Who Have Stood Me Up. I think i have a gene that creates a pheremone-like chemical called man-repellent.    work still sucks.  i'm still trying to find a job, that pays, that is in a lab, that is not completely bullshit secretarial work.  at least laura is cool.  we share an office.  funny story, to counter all the negativity i seem to spew in here: evidentially, according to my roommate here in D.C., i say very foul things in my sleep.  last week, i yelled "shut the fuck up!" at her when she woke up shrieking from a nightmare.  she actually thought i was conscious and angry.  she also told me this is not the first time i've said this too her  in my sleep.    my boss's goldfish is schizo.

      So.  I've been in Washington, D.C. for 4 weeks.  for those of you reading this (like that's anyone), I am a D.C. intern.  Now, don't think i've sold out completely.  The little non-profit i work for is called CAST, or the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.  I'm supposed to be doing the prep work for this national essay contest for jr. high kids, but so far, i spend about 7 out of the 8 hours of my workday fucking around online.  no one wants to fund this gig, so it's hard to make preparations.  no money=monkeying around on the internet.  Now, i really have put forth an effort to get what i can get done taken care of.  I've looked for alternate sources of funding.  we've written letters to people, etc.  the real holdup is the fact that i have to answer to someone.  yes, a boss.  and she's tied up with things a little more important than an essay contest.   in one word, i summarize my intern position as "frustration".  and i don't get paid.  so i've been searching for jobs.  i think i've applied to, like, a thousand places, but haven't heard from any of them.  it makes me wonder if i'll ever get hired.  are they so dim as to overlook my great and infinite potential?? i think i'm going back to grad school in a year.  the city is cool, anyhow.  it's political, intellectual, artistic, and fun.  you can get involved with anything here, it caters to ever interest.  the restaurants are great, because so many different people, really great cooks, from all over the world move here and sell food.  there's nightlife for everyone.  ESPECIALLY if you're gay.  i'm not gay, but gay bars are fun.  i think i want a gay man to decorate my house.  when i get a house.  that will be after i get a job. LOL!!!  as far as living situations go: NEVER LIVE WITH 5 OTHER GIRLS.  ESPECIALLY SORORITY OR SORORITY-LIKE GIRLS.  this was not my fault.  it was random housing assignments, courtesy of the omnicient and well meaning TAMU staff people.  i had a pet rat once, about the time they were rushing.  I MISS MY CAT AND MY SOLITUDE.

      Three really good things happened to me yesterday.&nbsp;   1) I got 11 hours of sleep wednesday night.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; After margaritas and mexican food, I returned home and fell asleep at 9pm, and woke up at 8am.  2) The letter I wrote to the Battalion (A&M campus paper) in rebuttle to some dumbshit's rant on art was published.&nbsp; Boy did I tell him!  3) I got a call about a job at UT Health science Center in san antonio.&nbsp; It's a full time research assistant position in a lab that studies the molecular genetics of DNA damage response.&nbsp; Yippie!  And then at dinner the boys just had to be douchebags and put everyone in a bad mood.&nbsp; I didn't know guys were supposed to whine so much.&nbsp; I thought they were supposed to be pillars of strength and patience, role models for the weaker sex.&nbsp; (Take this with MUCH sarcasm).&nbsp; Evidentially, that's a myth.  I really want to go to the beach.&nbsp; I've only been telling EVERYONE that since the beginning of the summer.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; Jeff is going to the beach.&nbsp; And Addie gets to stay in D.C.&nbsp; The next person I date WILL TAKE ME TO THE BEACH.&nbsp; In fact, the next guy I get involved with will actually give a shit about me and my interests, and want to spend a lot of time with me.&nbsp; And I can just keep telling that to myself, because those guys don't exist.&nbsp; They're a myth, like the pillar-of-strength-and-patience myth.  The sad part is, he's not an asshole.&nbsp; He's just self-absorbed and a bachelor, and wants to keep his distance.&nbsp; Which is fine, except I lose interest.&nbsp; And any other girl in her right mind will lose interest.&nbsp; Se la vie, I move back to Texas in 2 weeks anyhow.&nbsp; I'll just have my fun until I say adios.  I'm pretty bitchy today.&nbsp; Yesterday was my good day, today is bitchy day because it's the end of the week, I'm tired, have to sit at work for 8 hours when I just want to take a nap, and go see The Village, and I want the fat tire around my waist to disappear as well.&nbsp; The red line had delays, I got stuck in a tunnel for 10 minutes, and at a metro station for 10 more, which made me 20 minutes late for work.&nbsp; Great way to start the day when you want to ask your boss to write you a reference letter....oh well.&nbsp; Maybe she'll overlook my little misgivings and just focus on all the hard work I've done this summer....a girl can hope, right?

      in response to the July 27, 2004 Battalion opinion article, "Too abstract for aggieland"  urlLink www.thebatt.com :  I graduated in May 2004 with a B.S. in Genetics and am one of a long line of Aggies (3rd generation).&nbsp; I am also one of a long line of art lovers.&nbsp;   I believe, that at Texas A&M University, I received a great education, and the “proper knowledge that Aggies seek in their education and growth at this University.”&nbsp; Along with my science education, art played an enormous role in realizing this proper knowledge.  Art, in all of its forms, promotes thought and philosophy, and describes visually the human condition.&nbsp; When civilizations crumble, when Rome falls to the ground, art is what is left.   Abstract art is special, in that it gives the artist total freedom of fearless expression, and its audience total freedom of interpretation.&nbsp; The MSC Visual Arts Committee is a student organization that realizes this concept to its fullest.&nbsp; VAC, along with the many other art organizations at Texas A&M and in the B/CS community, hasn’t forgotten classic art and its principles.&nbsp; In fact, these organizations help cherish, promote, and preserve it.&nbsp; If you doubt this, just drop by the Forsyth Center Galleries, the Stark Galleries, or the Arts Committee of the Brazos Valley’s new center.&nbsp; The Visual Arts Committee takes a special interest in promoting modern art because it is symbolic of and represents our ever-evolving culture and ideas.&nbsp; Art organizations are not only preserving old values, but also protecting and promoting new ones.  &nbsp;Texas A&M University is unique in that it has such unifying traditions- why not make art one of them?&nbsp; The University has a most unique potential to become a cultural and an educational mecca in Texas- all it needs is a strong arts program to complete this vision.  It saddens me that Mike Walters is scared of this vision, and of free expression and interpretation.&nbsp; It angers me that he twists and contorts people’s words to fit his own restricting agenda.&nbsp; For his sake, and the sake of others sharing his militant opinions, I pray that he opens his eyes, comes out of the fog, and finally appreciates the beauty that surrounds him every day.  Addie Embry Class of ‘03 Former Chair of the MSC Visual Arts Committee  I hope they publish this...they sure do publish some BULLSHIT quite often

      It was an interesting weekend from some points of view.  As far as doing anything productive or respectable during the days, I didn't.&nbsp; Friday afternoon I took off early, to go sleep, so I could stay awake on the night's outing.&nbsp; My roommates woke me up reminiscing about their high school cheerleading days.&nbsp; This means that they were jumping around shreaking cheers at the tops of their lungs.&nbsp; At one point of semi-consciousness, I thought I was in an outer circle of Hell.  Julie and I went out.&nbsp; We ventured into Madame's Organ, where we managed to both get in for one $5 cover, because we went to the same university as the door man.&nbsp; This is the first real benefit of being an Aggie from Texas that I have encountered so far.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; We met up with a boy she knew, and his friends were HOT.&nbsp; I just wish they hadn't been entirely so drunk.&nbsp;   Saturday night we went out again, to a club in Georgetown, where some douchebag grabbed my ass ( I thoroughly berated him in front of his friends), and the some other douchebag said "yeah, I'd fuck you with a cowboy hat on."&nbsp;At that point I told him he'd crossed a great big fat line, and disappeared to the dance floor,&nbsp; where there were more ass grabbing neanderthals.&nbsp; At one point the rum got to my head, I became claustrophobic, and got to go home.&nbsp; YEAH! sleep.  At work, I'm currently reading a survivor's account of Auschwitz.&nbsp; It's grusome, I still can't fathom how humans managed to do this to other humans.&nbsp; It happens.&nbsp; We really are savages.&nbsp; Savage to be inhumane, savage to be able to survive inhumane acts.&nbsp; Whoever said there is no animal in us is a fool, and completely ignorant of &nbsp;our organic nature.  Enough rambling.&nbsp; Man, I have a case of the Mondays!&nbsp; I didn't sleep very well last night, it was too cold and I had a headache, there is no toilet paper, and I kept dreaming of murders and decomposing bodies in coffins.&nbsp; Lovely, huh?  &nbsp;

      "Sex on Demand: brainwash your woman to do your naked bidding"&nbsp; -Maxim article  Gee, what about an article somewhere on how to brainwash your MAN&nbsp;to do your naked bidding?&nbsp; Men don't seem to understand, what if I'm the one that wants it 4 times a day?  Even the racey Cosmo just feeds women articles on how to  please  their man.&nbsp; What about men pleasing  us ?&nbsp; That's something they never seem to be capable of.&nbsp; It's not that difficult.&nbsp; If you'd like some suggestions, just email me at  urlLink dig_ophelia9@hotmail.com , and I'll be happy to give you an earfull.  I work in an office with 3 women and 1 man.&nbsp; Somehow, the toilet seat is always up.&nbsp; Hmmm......breaking the seal too early in the day?

      I feel like my insides are deep waters with chaotic currents.&nbsp; My emotions are on a skateboard, and I keep running into walls.&nbsp;   Instability is the name of it today.&nbsp; I need more sleep...no, I need to relax.&nbsp; But that's impossible.&nbsp; I don't want to stay here, but I don't exactly want to leave.&nbsp; I just want to be somewhere else, but I can't really think of a place I want to be right now.&nbsp; Maybe in France, by the coast, where I can wander around very old relics and churches, and not have to talk to anyone because they are all speaking French and I'm not.&nbsp; And then I can visit Laurence, have some fun and drink a LOT of good wine.&nbsp;   Right now, at the moment, all I can do is dream.&nbsp; I'm really close to falling asleep at the desk, so maybe dreaming is not so impossible.&nbsp; It's making dreams come true that's almost impossible.  I'm obsessed with two songs at the moment: Datura by Tori Amos and Blue by A Perfect Circle.&nbsp; Those are the only 2 cd's I listen to anymore, maybe it's because they such damn good albums.&nbsp;   Being in this city, I thought I'd find a niche, you know, a place where I really fit in.&nbsp; I held out for the city, surely in places that big there are tons of people like me, and I'm not such a weird anomaly.&nbsp; But, alas.&nbsp; Either I am simply in the metropolitan area, or my entire theory is&nbsp;bullshit.&nbsp; It's such a predicament: if I hid who I am and never let loose, I can blend in pretty well, and be accepted by most everyone.&nbsp; If I just let go, I scare everything around me.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing I'm just naturally kind of antisocial.&nbsp; But I am sick of&nbsp;being a freak, or at least feeling like one.&nbsp;   I've gotta start letting go, though, it's getting all bottled in, and bottling explosive materials will eventually cause an explosion (duh).&nbsp; A little spark is all it needs.&nbsp; Besides, I miss being creative and artistic.&nbsp; I miss music.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I'll just give up on going to grad school for molecular biology and just go to art school instead.&nbsp;   Isn't there a way to do it all?&nbsp;

      oh yeah &nbsp; 5:30 is torture.&nbsp; I think that time slows down in between 5:30 and 6pm.&nbsp; The morning flies by, it's pretty moderate until 5:30, and then time itself stalls.&nbsp; At least at work.&nbsp; And it doesn't matter where I'm working. &nbsp; I discover more and more about myself every day.&nbsp; And these things I find out would have scared me five years ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I still hate my ex boyfriend.&nbsp; Is this bad?&nbsp; I mean, I don't get pissed off anymore, I barely ever think of him anymore.&nbsp; (you know, THAT exboyfriend, yeah, you remember...).&nbsp; The thing is, my subconscious brings it up, usually in the wee hours of the morning during REM, and the things I do to him and his counterpart are horrible.&nbsp; And I enjoy it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So the guy I'm seeing has a daughter.&nbsp; I know her name, and that she's five.&nbsp; That's about it.&nbsp; I'm REALLY fucking curious about her.&nbsp; I want to ask him so many questions, but I don't think it's any of my business.&nbsp; I guess my curiosity will win out soon, it usually does.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I'm gonna get into a lot of trouble someday. &nbsp; Hmmm, I really feel like taking a trip to France.&nbsp; I want to walk across the bay to Mont St. Michelle and contemplate my life, and play "stay out of the quicksand".&nbsp;

      You know what?&nbsp; I realized I have 3 weekends&nbsp; left here.&nbsp; 4 weeks in DC.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; I'm ready to go home, too.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So, Friday night I saw the Violent Femmes live at club 9:30.&nbsp; It was rockin.&nbsp; I felt like shit, but I still rocked.&nbsp; Then, I waited 30 MINUTES for a damn train to go to Dupont to eat at an overpriced deli.&nbsp; It was good, but mom makes better sandwiches, and so does Blue Baker.&nbsp; But, neither mom nor Blue Baker are to be had in DC, so Cosi's it is.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I went home and slept for 14 hours.&nbsp; My supposed cold just disappeared!&nbsp; Saturday was laundry afternoon.&nbsp; Then I went to Jeff's and played with the dog and cooked dinner.&nbsp; Spaghetti Laurence-style.&nbsp; And, of course, action.&nbsp; A-C-T, I-O-N, action, action, woohoo! action!&nbsp; That was Julie's cheer for me Saturday night.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I really don't know what to do about that boy.&nbsp; It's obviously goodbye forever once I leave, and I have a pretty good idea he's not too attached to me or anything.&nbsp; So I guess it'll all be ok. &nbsp; I'm a little mellow, maybe because I'm thinking of all the goodbyes I'll have to say in a few weeks, maybe it's because I haven't taken my little pink and purple happy pills in two days.&nbsp; Gotta get that damn prescripion filled today...Maybe it's because I'm having no luck with getting somewhere with my future.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I really want to go to the drag queen brunch on some sunday morning.&nbsp; drag queens serenade with show tunes while you dine.&nbsp; Sounds like my kind of deal.

      again, TWICE a day.  there's a lot of catching up to do.    nick IMed me.  i think he said 2 sentences, and then went off to do what nick does best (i know him well, but besides getting laid by sorority girls, i have no idea what THAT is).  so, back to the office solitude.  we're trying to throw a party for the interns.  but interns just don't know how to commit to anything.  and i don't blame them.  the last time i committed to something seriously, it was a DISASTER.  it's like my dad asking me if i want to go kyaking and fishing and swimming on labor day with the rest of my family, and possibly a few long-lost friends, and i can't give him a "yes", even though i KNOW i won't be doing anything.    employment it futile i am beginning to believe.  employment and dating.  i guess it'll be back to grad school for me soon.    joanie liked her birthday present.  i liked that shade of orange, i'm glad i was there when julie bought it.  don't worry, joanie, france is full of eastern markets.  you should know better than me.  like the coldest winter wind, heaven beside you, hell within.  i'm off to eat my cookie

      My parents traveled to DC and visited me for a week.  I enjoyed it, although it does get a little stressful.  I think I'd rather see them at home, in their own environment, than drag them up here.  Things move so fast here, I never realized how slow they moved.  And they move slow.  Not like old people, like people who aren't in a hurry.  I think they were the only people in DC this past week that weren't in a giant hurry.    We did all the touristy things: a tour of the Capitol, went up in the Washington monument, Smithsonians out the ass, tours of the monuments.  I am TOURED OUT.  The flew back to San Angelo yesterday, and it's back to work for me.    I hope it rains this afternoon.  I want an excuse, any excuse to just go to bed once I get home.  Although, I might have to take a detour to H&M, my favorite store.  Nah, I'll save it for the weekend.  I really want to go home.  Funny, I'm always one to disappear somewhere in the world, and look forward to being in strange places.  But right now I am so tired.  I feel like I'm getting sick, and would like some solitude so that I may heal.  The exhaustion disease.  I miss Texas, the unbearable heat, the cicadas screaming in the evenings, swimming and fishing in a river, my friends; the whole summer "feeling" that is missing up here in the northwest.  Maybe it's just me, I don't know.

      I fell asleep again at the office.  I think this makes everyday for 2 weeks straight.  It is so hard to keep my eyes open, and when they are open, I get headaches from the computer screen.  It is stuffy and smells like a bathroom in here.  I have felt nauseous all day, and continue to feel nauseous as I type.  For some reason, my body decides to hate me once a month, for about a week.    Back to talking about work:  we are in the middle of calling all lifetime members who have failed to give us email addresses.  In my grossened state, I cannot bring myself to pick up the phone and start dialing today.  I hate calling strangers on the phone, and repeating myself over and over and over and over....you get the picture.  Most of these people are old, and the wives that answer the phone are just flat out bitchy.  I don't understand what gives old women the idea that they have the right to be mean and rude.  What assholes.  My parents arrived in D.C. yesterday.  The look so out of place in this mess of a city!  It was almost impossible to get them acquainted with the metro.  Funny how things that come so naturally to people my age are so alien to people my parents' ages.  They are going to WEAR ME OUT, too.  We're doing all of this touristy stuff.  Tack that onto work and my usual evening activities.  No sleep for Addie.    I finally registered for the GRE just a few minutes ago.  I stumbled across online registration and I was trying to get through to the testing center over the phone.  So online registration it was.  August 2, Monday, at 10:30am.  Hopefully I will do well, and not have to retake it again.  It costs $115 a pop.  And I still need to take a subject test.  Those are tough shit.  Daily Prayer: PLEASE, GOD, HELP ME GET A JOB. And please help Jeff stay out of jail.  Thank you. Amen.

      I ate way too much guacamole yesterday.  And ice cream.  I've found a new favorite, Ben and Jerry's mint chocolate cookie.  It's rewarding to dig the big hunks of cookies out of the ice cream.  The guacamole was great, Cindy made it.  We sat there watching Law and Order and pigged out.  I, of course, felt gross, and laid down on my bed at 8:30 and promptly fell asleep.  I woke up at 10pm, wrote in my journal, chilled to Tori on the headphones, and fell asleep once more.  Today is no-makeup day.  I have an ever-increasing number of no-makeup days.  My security must be back again; that and the fact that I don't give a shit if I'm attractive or not.  It's just way too damn hot and humid to be wearing that crap on my face.    This afternoon would be splendid by the pool.  But, alas, I must work.  Maybe the weekend will be nice and sunny and pool-friendly.  I have decided that my sister should write in her blog more often.  And that one of my roommates must fall off the balcony.  She needs to go, she was "spawned in a forgotten corner of hell", as Joanie put it.    I have never dealt with an evil pink rice kitten before.  I usually wash the dishes before they start growing scary things.    Let's hope something interesting happens soon.

      This weekend was interesting.  I had a long weekend, Sunday being the 4th of July, and Monday being a federal holiday.  This government loves giving holidays, which is fine with me.    A recruitment company in Houston found my resume online at monster.com, and called to see if I was interested in a position.  I said of course I am, and they asked me about my schedule.  I explained that I was in DC.  They couldn't tell me if the position was immediate, but said they would call back with more information.  I hope they call back.  Somehow, I think I'll end up being the one to call them back...  It rained on the 4th, and DC fireworks suck.  I miss Bastille Day.  The French sure know how to entertain pyromaniacs.  I had another date with Jeff.  I think the whole 'date' thing is a polite front to just hooking up.  I'm beginning to think that's all he's really interested in, but he's a hard one to read.  That's fine by me.  However, if we're going to be hook-up buddies, he needs to learn a few things about pleasing women.  YOU HAVE TO RECIPROCATE, JEFF.  Otherwise, go buy a blowup doll and leave me alone.  We do play a lot of pool, which I enjoy.  I like pool, darts, and drinking ciders.  I do see myself with someone a little more, let's say, cultured, in the long term.  Someone who enjoys art and good literature.  Someone who reciprocates....

      All my life, I dreamed of living in the city.    Well, at least all of my adolescent/adult life.  That's where the action is.  That's where I'll become someone, where I'll be part of it all instead of an observer on the sidelines of life.   And now, I just want some peace and quite for a while.  There's no pleasing me. So much to do, see, and hear, and so many people to meet.  Potential lovers, friends, enemies. I want to hide.  I need a break.  I need to go wander through some wilderness until I start talking to myself for entertainment.  Because I feel like I've been shoved into a little box.    In a way, I have been.  A 3 bedroom apartment with 6 girls.  At least 2 of us are in there all the time.  I share a room with another girl.  An apartment, stacked on top of and in between and beside hundreds of dwellings, all conforming to the same blueprint.  The building itself surrounded, by other buildings, tunnels, shops, PEOPLE.  A small closet-office at work, shared with a coworker.  The metro, big boxes on wheels crammed full of people, coming and going from their respective and shared cubes and boxes.  It's fun for a while, but I really wonder if we were meant to live like this.

      for many people, if you scratch the surface, you might break the skin.  I had my first work-related nightmare last night.  I had, or i thought I had, finished a grant proposal that's due July 1st.  When I visited my boss to review it, she went off on my about how lazy and stupid I was...that i didn't do the proposal correctly, I left out a bunch of stuff, etc, etc.  So I had to go home and work on it, and stay up all night finishing it.  There were so many distractions, no one would leave me alone and let me work.  I got caught up in some stupid game a church group was playing in my back yard.  Every time I tried to go to the bathroom I was surrounded by people watching.  Shit like that.  Just embarrassing, distracting, annoying, and downright disturbing.  I hate dreams when i can't be in control.  I wonder if the soft spot on my stomach, the spare tire, will ever go away.  Or if it's just a fixture, a right of passage into being 23 years old.  I wish I could take it off my midsection, and give it to my poor tiny breasts.  Then at least I'd be in proportion.  Ok, I'm exaggerating.  It's not that bad.  I still have perfectionist tendencies sometimes, and I'm tired of looking at women on TV who are too skinny to be alive.  the crack-whore look is in, evidentially.  That's what is attractive, and I'm not fitting the bill.  I guess give it a few years.  Wouldn't it be great if we could go back in time to where full figures were HOT?  Greek goddesses, Renaissance art.  As much as I like Sex in the City, those women can kiss my ass.

      I had the strangest dream last night.  In fact, I've been having a lot of weird dreams lately.  My first boyfriend is in them all, I keep running into him unexpectedly.  In the last one, I wanted to get back together with him, and he couldn't make up his mind (big surprise, he never could make up his mind about me).  His brother was there, which was weird.  I'd forgotten he had a brother.  At least I think he has some siblings.  Anyhow, his brother looked just like him.  Which isn't bad looking.  Anyhow, it was my birthday, I was in Austin, my whole family was there, and all of my friends.  It seems everyone I've ever met, who are friends, distant or close, was there.  I got hit on my a lesbian, who did a strip tease, and I ran away, because I wasn't interested in her, I was looking for someone else.  I'd forgotten about my birthday, so had everyone else.  Then Matt Bendall walked in the room and I drew a huge flower on his back with some sort of ink, although I was supposed to draw on the canvas he was wearing as a shirt...anyhow, he took the canvas and a couple of boxes out of his pocket, and gave them to me, he was the only one who remembered.  That's the happiest I'd felt in a long time.  We ended up together instead of my ending up with my ex boyfriend who could never make up his mind.  This is all strange, Matt B. is a very strange person, although alluring and fun.  He likes animals and that's always good in my book.  But I haven't spoken to him in months, and never think about him, so why the dream?   Anyhow, I decided last week to be happy about being single.  I've just quit caring about finding serious relationship, because it will equal the end of my freedom.  I have close friends and a family who all love me, so why do I need a guy?   I don't know if its the prozac, or all of the emotional shit I've dealt with over the years, but I feel like I've lost part of my imagination and creativity.  All of that seems to stem from my emotions, mainly the bad ones, which drive me nuts from time to time.  I have worked very hard for a healthier emotional state, but seem to have lost something in the process.  Maybe it's not gone, maybe it's just hibernating.  I feel some sort of euphoria rising, I think, (it's been a long time), possibly a combination of a new start in my life, open possibilites, and the wonderfully mysterious fall weather in D.C.   And Jason, I'm sorry I missed your show(s), but I am nowhere near College Station or Oklahoma at this time in my life.

      rapists, beware....  "An angry mob in a township beat and stabbed three men they accused of raping a young girl, then covered them in petrol and tyres and set them alight, police said on Monday.A crowd of more than 350 residents confronted the men on Sunday night in the township of Tjokville near Jeffreys Bay in the Eastern Cape, accusing them of raping a local girl on Friday, Police Captain Gavin Baker said."They were beaten and stabbed. They basically used petrol and put tyres over the bodies," he said."We can't say whether they were alive when they burnt them, or if they were already dead. The bodies were quite badly charred."Baker said one man had been arrested and would appear in court on Tuesday on murder charges. More arrests were expected. " -IOL.co.za  food for thought, guys...  "The male "artist" attempts to solve his dilemma of not being able to live, of not being female, by constructing a highly artificial world in which the male is heroized, that is, displays female traits, and the female is reduced to highly limited, insipid subordinate roles, that is, to being male. The male "artistic" aim being, not to communicate (having nothing inside him he has nothing to say), but to disguise his animalism, he resorts to symbolism and obscurity ("deep" stuff). The vast majority of people, particularly the "educated" ones, lacking faith in their own judgment, humble, respectful of authority ("Daddy knows best"), are easily conned into believing that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, ambiguity and boredom are marks of depth and brilliance. " -SCUM __________________________________________________________________________  Heehee, yesterday, MSN.com had an article entitled "7 reasons they cheat" (or something like that), going on about why men cheat on their special ladies. It was awful, the mentality of these assholes! Seven different guys justifying why they cheat on the women they are dating. The irony of it is, today msn.com has an article entitled "7 ways to keep him interested". I was expecting something more on the lines of "7 ways to get even", but I guess I just have a skewed view of justice in this world.  If my eyelashes keep shedding, I'm going to have bald eyes.

      It's gonna be so weird leaving DC.  There are so many cops around here.  Cops on bikes, motorcycles, horses, in cars, and on foot.  Even in those little golf cart things.  The have machine guns, handguns, they stop cars at certain intersections to check for weapons and bombs.  They're on my side, and on yours.  When I get home, the security won't be so great.  It'll be strange.   I went on a pollinator tour at the botanical gardens this morning.  The gardens are beautiful, it makes me want to research plants and habitats for hummingbirds, bats, bees and butterflies and set up my own little paradise.   Some bats eat 10,000 mosquitos a day.  The things I learn are amazing.  The gardens also had really great displays of different habitats around the world, and a great room full of medicinal plants.  This I have to get into.  I wonder, is wormwood illegal to grow in a private garden?  Turns out Jeff and I are just friends with benefits.  I've known this all along, but it made me happy to hear him say it.  Now I feel very comfortable seeing him and talking to him.  And we can stay on speaking terms once I leave this place without things being weird and fucked up.   You know, I think I could be very happy just having a big old house with lots of windows, a big garden, and lots of time to paint and write.  And my fat 16 pound cat.  That's right, Franklin is now 16.3 pounds.  Lard-ass if I ever saw one.

      Well, it seems as if Laurence has had a heartbreak of her own.  Apparently the guy who dicked her around for at least 4 years decided to date the last person on earth Laurence could stand to see him with.  The poor think CALLED ME FROM FRANCE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT (which was  early  Saturday morning for her) because she was so upset she couldn't sleep.  And as you all know, I'm an avid Friday night socialite.  So, I heard the story, it was parallel to my own tragedy of last summer, which we are all familiar with.   We will call Laurence's ex-lover mr.pussy ass, and the girl (if that word is fitting, it might be too positively descriptive) skank face.

      I consider myself an open minded, culturally diverse, art loving person, but canned feces?!?  Great Art! From time to time News of the Weird has reported on the fluctuating value of the late Italian artist Piero Manzoni's personal feces, which he canned in 1961, 30 grams at a time in 90 tins, as art objects (though, over the years, 45 have reportedly exploded). Their price to collectors has varied from about $28,000 for a tin in 1998 to $75,000 in 1993. In June 2002, the Tate Gallery in London excitedly announced it had purchased tin number 004 for about $38,000. (The price of 30 grams of gold at that time was a little over $300.)

      So I had this really strange dream last night.  I was in some sort of a superhero family at first, and decided to take the car for a spin.  It was a batmobile looking thing, except more like a fighter jet on the inside, and man it moved fast.  My sister and I had way too much fun in that thing.  We adoringly called it Cobra.  After that, there was a party, I think it was a birthday party for Laurence.  Anyhow, I was dressed in black underwear, a bra, and a big, white down comforter that I was using as a coat.  Dancing and dancing, and making out with some hot guy, who turned out to be some slut hound.  We were all dancing to this song, My Sherona.  Then Laurence said she really wanted fish sticks, that the party just wasn't right without fish sticks.  So I went outside with her for a cigarette to figure out how to get these fish sticks.   More guests show up, Misty Alvarado in a Toyota Corolla.  I haven't seen her in years.  We go back into the house where the party is, by this time the guy I was with is with some other chick, but I don't really care...just start dancing again.  Except this time I don't feel attractive and fun, I feel kind of stupid and like a bad dancer...I sneak back out to the Cobra...  Then I wake up at 8:15am and realize that I am going to be VERY late for work.  I think this dream indicates that I have some issues.  1) For the first time in my life, I am very unhappy with my weight.  I actually think about it a lot.  The bathroom scale, which Michelle swears is right, tells me that I weight 140 lbs.  This is impossible.  Or is it???  My tummy is really not toned.  This time last year, I was something like 118lbs, which is really too skinny, and I have grown some since in the hips anyhow.  Solution: Take taikwondo.  Figure out how to pay for it, and find a teacher.  2) Not happy with dating, boys, guy situation.  I am never going to get a date again.  I feel like they're always looking for something better, and that's not me.  No one I've dated really ever appreciated me like they should have, which makes me think that maybe this is an impossible feat.  I get mad when I don't get enough attention, I get freaked out when I get too much.  I can't trust anyone I'm dating, for what could possibly make them stick around when some hotter, sexier, skinnier, smarter, wittier, more athletic, more talented, more communicative, nicer girl comes along?  These are my experiences.  And most of the men I've been involved with are just lazy, or big pussies, or both.  Big lazy pussy babies, and this raises contempt for them in my heart.  For the whole gender. Solution: Move back in with my cat and stop thinking about men.  3) I miss my friends.  I miss having people around that I really care about, and who really care about me.  It's time to quit moving around so much, and stay in one place for a while.  Solution: Move back to Texas, get a job, get into a good grad school.
