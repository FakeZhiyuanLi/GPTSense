      Hi there. How you doing? It's been awhile, hasn't it?  I'm starting this blog so I have someplace to scrawl when the mood takes me, which  it does less frequently than it used to, back when I was doing it for a "living."  The name "The Stash Dauber" was given to me by Dave Karnes. If you see him, you can ask him to explain what it means. I'm told he also does a good imitation of me. If you ask him, he'll probably do that, too.  The acronym FWAC stands for "Fort Worth Arts Collective." Right now, the FWAC is a body that exists mainly in the minds of Tony Diaz, Jordan Richardson, Joe Vano, and myself. It's the result of conversations we've been having for the past few months about the state o' the music scene here in Funkytown, and What To Do About It.  We all know that Fort Worth has experienced tremendous growth in the last four years: we're now bigger than Boston, Seattle, D.C., etc. The same census data shows that the city is hemmorhaging people in the 25-to-35 age bracket. That'd be the demographic that supports live music, by and large -- which would account for declining attendance at live shows over the past few seasons. Another mystery solved. Woo-hoo.  At the same time, you see random events like last year's Jazz By (Near?) the Boulevard festival, which drew somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 people over two nights last September (this year, they're projecting 50,000), or the Pablo and the Hemphill 7/Darth Vato show that brought 350 people (a $2000 door, imagine that) to the Wreck Room back in June. It kinda begs the question, "What would it take to get that many people [or in the former case, even a fraction of...] out to support live music on a regular basis?"  One answer: Try and make every show more of an Event. On a more practical level, though, perhaps it'd make more sense to try and build a greater awareness by folks here in town of just how much great music (and visual art, and poetry, and...) they have here -- more, I'd say from the limited amount of traveling I did last year, than the average American burg. That's not a recent development, either. Read your history: Fort Worth has been a cradle for innovation and creativity in country, western swing, blues, jazz, and rock musics for most of the last century. With all the ongoing and planned growth and development taking place in this town, wouldn't it make sense to promote Fort Worth as a music town a la Austin? Sure, we've got great museums, the Cliburn competition, the symphony, etc., but what about great creative people who are doing their best work right now? Fort Worth's always been a town with a built-in (and highly undeserved) inferiority complex. The time to start changing that is NOW.  What we have in mind is NOT to create some kind of bullshit elite "in-group," or one or two phoney media "stars." Rather, we're interested in promoting an environment where musicians, artists, etc., can have sustainable careers practicing their craft over their lifetimes. This means helping them recognize their responsibility for and get wiser about marketing and promoting their work (records, live shows, tours, etc.), as well as cross-promoting each other's. Also, finding ways (as many as we can) to increase the size of the performance opportunity pie for Fort Worth musicians (rather than having them fight for a bigger slice of a shitty little one) -- to include networking and building connections outside the immediate area, as well as increasing attendance at local shows. Finally, we want to be able to speak with one authoritative voice to the people in city government, the chamber of commerce, etc., who have the resources to promote the city's music scene to the world at large. And down the road, who knows...depending on people's interest and desires, perhaps forming a nonprofit that could provide things like medical insurance to people who do creative work for a living.  The reason you were contacted was because we believe you have ideas and experiences that would be valuable to the dialog, and are articulate and astute enough to be an effective advocate for all of this if you, uh, buy in. Our first roundtable will be fairly freewheeling, designed to generate a lot of input and get as many ideas as possible on the table. Then we can collectively decide A) if this idea is worth pursuing and B) what form and direction it should take. Come ready to listen and be respectful of others ideas, as well as presenting as many of your own as possible. We hope to see you there.
