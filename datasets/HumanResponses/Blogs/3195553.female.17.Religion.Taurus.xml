      I understand that you don't want to commit, but you don't have to lead me on and make me think otherwise. You obviously lied to me because you have found other people since you regurgitated me. You raped my heart like the sinister threat of a naked room, a think cloud of abnegation coldly forms above your head, a smile spreads across your face, I am free from the sepulture you have placed me in. Hurting people is a second nature to you. Screams of terror exonerate your ears as you shit on me my very emotions for everyone to see after you swallowed them whole. You want to forever damnate me to the depths of my own jealousy, stupidity, and sorrow because yo disrelish me so. You abandoned me because you ravaged me until there was nothing left, you used me for your own presonal gain. You took everything you wanted and then left me there obliterated because you wanted to ease your pain. I was so naive to your ways and then I realized that you never loved me it was all a part of your act that was beneficial to your self-confidencebut you were so inconspicuous that nobody knew what your real intentions were. I guess you wanted to conspire against me, you hate me and want me to suffer consistant to how self concious you are feeling. I don't understand why you think you are so elite. You pretend to have a distorted vision when in truth you are just searching for a little reassurance to make you feel better than everyone else. I trusted you but the truth came out. You want me to drown in your own self-gratified exceptionalism, all you want to do is execute your plan to make me feel inferior to make me feel how you feel, but you were just a distraction to keep my mind off the pain but now that's over with you but the pain stays and there is nothing I can do to sustain it. It is lie the sadistic thoughts of a catholic priest dying to be alone with the child within.......

      She cuts her arms when things get too hard she's a horrible person damnated forever to relive the things that she has done wrong she tried to change but there is lost time to make up for she tried to save her soul but she took too long she cuts herself with a swiss army knife because she thinks all the pain will better her life all the times she was left in the dark, time has penetrated skin and left a mark the guilt is eating her alive she has ran too long from the things keeping her down there's no more time to run and hide no one gets out alive, no one survives I've taken my own life there is still blood dripping from the knife

      I swallow my pride as I'm raped on the inside I hear you coming so I run and hide my thoughts of killing you subside as I wish I had died but it doesn't matter, what can I do, I'm nothing of use, nothing to you all the pain you brought, all the lessons you taught, all the times you lied and got caught I think my life is over don't say you can't see it, or maybe you can and you just don't believe it I can't see myself living without all the times that I was in doubt I dried off my eyes and denied everything but a knife in which I cut myself because it felt good and I wanted to see blood but I very seldom could because there was always an interuption or something to stop me but that great once and a while when I was alone that was when I felt at ease because I know myself that I will kill as I slit my wrists and watch the blood spill

      The reason I didn't cry was because I saw you laughing, making fun of my feelings of which you raped criticizing laughter at the least just let me go in peace I want to be free of your grip why can't you just release you haven't let go I can see it in your eyes and you'll never ever know that I've deciphered all your lies, I remember you told me that I'd never see you cry but I saw those tears come from your eyes you're so pathetic, why did you lie you could have told the truth and I would've excepted you but I believed all the lies that you told me I believed all of your lies I bought all the bullshit you sold me but you did it just to get a rise you won it's over but next time you won't be so lucky someone will do to you what you do to others and I hope they do it soon because you deserve all the pain that comes to you I hope they make you bleed I hope they make you cry I hope they cure your greed I hope you never lie you haven't let go I can see it in your eyes, you'll never ever know that I've ever seen you cry

      My faith is gone anything I've ever believed in has been crushed with my last breath drawn I utter your name in utter disgust you've gained my blame and lost my trust the only thing keeping me alive is my hatred for you, my despise this isn't a disguise I patiently anticipate my demise yet no one knows that they won't survive no one cries no one cares the sirens blare as everyone stares life is unfair that's to be expected but no one's aware that my life is so fucked up and I swear I found a tear in the web of my dreams and this wall has been shattered as if that mattered because no one even hears when I let out a scream it's not what it seems life doesn't seem real and you have no idea exactly how it feels to be ripped apart at the seams to have a broken heart or broken dreams or an artificial existence  what do you do when life stops making sense do I put up a fence around my cold black heart if I wanted to talk about it where should I start where does it end? If only I had a friend I wouldn’t be complete but I wouldn’t be breakable I’d only bend can you comprehend the thoughts in my head can you mend the holes in my bed can you sew closed the cuts on my arms can you do anything to fix my broken heart? I was completely ok before you tore my world apart

      I've never woken up without something that I've had the day before I've never felt so lost or alone my story is still untold do you know how it feels to be alone I know that feeling all too well the empty feeling of redemption I've placed myself in my own personal hell the more I think about it the more empty I feel and the lonliness comes rushing back in one big attack I've lost the key and can't find my way back so close the door and lock it take a gun and cock it shoot me in the face blood on my white lace take me from this place time goes by so slowly but the memories come too fast you'd think it could all be forgotten you'd think the past has passed after all that I've been through you'd think that I'd be free at last

      You lost the opportunity for me to ever love you, you lost the opportunity for me to ever care I have to grow before my weaknesses I have to rise above you still standing on the stairs  barely there who would care dare me to die I dare you to cry time passes by I don't know why. Why did you lie? No more tears I've shed my last vapid whore the past is past what was I thinking when I thought you'd tell the truth whats the use I'm sick of your abuse, I have feelings too. ------------------------------------------------------------------

      you make me sick the way you are such a fucking hypocrit I don't really understand you portray one thing yet you feel another you won't tell the truth you're making me bitter just be yourself and tell me what is going on you thought sounded really convincing but what you said wasn't cogent and it didn't all fit to me I can't put all the pieces together I just don't get what you are saying can you just tell me the fucking truth I need to know what is going on why can't you just tell me what you are feeling I didn't mean to lay a guilt trip on you and I have learned from this experience because now I know not to trust a friend but an enemy who I didn't think I could trust but apparently that means nothing to you because since I could tell the truth from the lies you were never being honest

      Letting go of everything was easy to do, easy because you hurt me, easy because of you but now that I am drowning it is getting hard to breathe suffocation seems like a good way to go why can't you save me? I think I have lost control if I am not crazy you could've fooled me if I died would you miss me or would you forget about me Does it even matter if you found me dead on the floor would you let me be I really don't care so just stay away from me

      I hear a faint scream, an echo of aberation in your eyes I know that you could never let go, but you should go live your life of patriotism and I'll go live my life of self inflicted pain I would break away but I am scared that I will hurt myself again You go live your life of dissembled legitmacy and I'll live my life of incestuous virtue and while I'm at it I'll bury you alive I know you're immortal and I know you won't die and I know I can't kill you but why not try

      you can know her pain by the look in her eyes you can see disdain in the tears that she cries but silence says it all she wants to be left alone she is always surrounded and has yet to be overthrown but sometimes surrounded is the lonliest place to be, but you cant tell, you cant see you dont understand no you never fucking will your grip is too loose this is fucking unreal your silent screams are deafening me and you're telling me now what i dont want to hear she is right here now with that cold glaring stare so dont pretend you dont see her, she is everywhere that mocking smile haunting my dreams a distortion of reality like you think you are close to figuring her out but its not what it seems she knows me better than i know myself but i still cant seem to see what shes about she slit her wrists to bleed her wrath i scream her pain to fall to death

      I'm not exactly sure what has left me to be so skeptical of the people around me. I guess it's the lack of trust and my hatred for humanity. And I have no way of ever knowing what in the world has caused me to be so misanthropic. I have a hatred for humanity as pure as the driven snow and I live my life with a trust no one attitude. The best advice I could ever give someone is, don't ever let anyone in. People have their own fucked up agenda and your best friend will fuck you over to help themselves. The only person you can truly come close to trusting is yourself and there are times when you can't even do that much. Everyone is set out to get you so they can feel better about themselves. That is fucked up. I guess I could be considered reclusive to a certain extent, but that is because I prefer to be alone than in the presence of idiocy. The human race is oddly happy but it makes a perfect example for the quote that I appointed to humanity. "Ignorance is bliss" I guess I am bitter.....

      I could wait forever for something to appear I don't see my own reflection when i look in the mirror I can't see a thing my vision is unclear I don't remember why I woke up here I see you standing before me bleeding my one and only fear the look in my eyes so lost and abandoned my judgement is clouded everything I've doubted my worst nightmares are coming true my whole world came crashing down in one big spiral my smile has turned in to a cold dark frown and all I can do is live in denial..........

      Every scar has a story and every story goes untold hidden secrets filled with worry empty and hollow take a deep breath and swallow  no one knows which way does the wind blow? How many times have I been bleeding in vain? How many times have I cut myself to try to avoid the pain? I can't take these long days and somber nights I can't take how I don't even try to put up a fight my walls have been raised at the end of the day all I can be is me and I think that's ok. I don't like myself and neither do you but it sucks to live in a world full of so much and all you can think about is how you have been screwed it seems as if my whole world constantly comes unglued. I'm unfixable doomed to be broken forever after all the tricks are pulled you're left there naked raped and savagely beaten everyday reliving the past pretending to be happy as if you wear a mask to cover your feelings I'm jumping so high but I'm still so far away from the ceiling I have tried to be dealing with my monster but all I've ever wanted to do is die and the thought of death is constant........

      How can you forget the one thing your mind won't let you? Why do I have to relive all the pain in my life? Why can't I forget? It's like fucking ground hog day. Every single fucking day is the fucking same. Reliving the same fucking things that I don't want to remember. I can't forget about it and it consumes my every thought. It takes over my mind, am I in hell? Have I died and been put where I belong? A place that doesn't exist,there are people here that I can see right through this has to be unreal if this isn't hell then why do I have to be constantly reminded of everything that has ever gone wrong? This constant depression fucking up my life, can't you leave me alone? I'm drowning in a pool of my own fucking blood. I've cut my arm again only this time it's no longer for fun. I can't run from myself and I certainly can't hide. I feel like the only choice that I have left is suicide. I can't abide by your rules, I've already played the fool. I'm not just a tool you can use whenever something needs fixing you have already beat me like a cheap rug and if i was on life support I have no doubt in my mind that you would pull the plug and then you'd throw my lifeless body in the hole I already dug.....mend my shattered soul I've completely lost control fix my bleeding heart your acid tongue has torn my world apart. Where did I start? I'm full of pure and undiluted hatred my whole life has been forsaken shaken stirred my eyes are blurred from my tears of blood you aren't the first to lose my trust, I'll hold my breath until I bust.......
