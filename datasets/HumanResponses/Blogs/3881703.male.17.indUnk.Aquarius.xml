      feel damn shag today. i got not enough sleep!!!!!!!!! was watching GTO special yesterday until 12.30 and then wake up at 4 to watch copa final. brazil win, yea!!!!!! they manage to score a goal at the last minute to equalize and then win the penalties 4-2. i think it must be watching the final tt allow me to stay awake for the first few lessons of the day but then my mind starts to shut down as the lesson never fails to bore me. just slept for 2 hrs but still feel damn tired. dun even have the energy to type( typing very slowly now)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  i really need to go catch up with my sleep or else i will sleep thru the whole day tmr

      just watched brotherhood today. it is definitely one damn good show. very touching with a lot of battle scene. i still dun know y it is nc16. there are not enough blood and it is like band of brothers except tt it is koreans not americans. won bin is really damn yan dao and zhang dongjian is damn cool.   warning spoiler ahead  brotherhood is abt two brothers who got accidentally drafted. the older bro( played by zhang dongjian) try to send his little bro home by trying to earn a medal on the battlefield. he volunteer for all sort of mission such as laying mines near the enemy line. at last he rise in rank by leading his force in a last attempt to break out of the siege.&nbsp; after tt battle, he has gained fame and he start to neglect his little bro. then they began their counter attack and he even manage to capture an enemy officer but at the expense of one of soldier( the soldier is trying to save his butt while he fight it out with the officer) the little bro discover he had changed and began more ruthless and cold blooded.   i dun feel like writing anymore but for those interested to find out what happen to the brothers, go watch the movie. heck care if u r under 16, try to sneak in. i bet u will be trying yur best not to cry when u watch the scene when the older&nbsp;bro sacrifice his life to let&nbsp;won bin escape. tt scene is damn damn touching. go watch this movie, definitely worth yur time and money.&nbsp;

      Today is a good day. one good thing is no morning assembly!!!!! spend the whole of today either reading manga or sleeping during lecture. actually i wanted to pon p.e. and zao home but too bad, my pw grp is having a meeting. the meeting started late as our grp can't seem to be together in a place for long. we will be either be buying food or toking to frens or simply not there at all. finally we get down to serious business and manage to get some things done( which is distributing the work among us ) the minute for my grp is quite glorious, all thanks to qing zhen who contribute quite alot and angwei who is taking them down.  now here i am, trying to find some articles or else i will be dead meat as the file need to be handed on THUR!!!!! oh crap, god pls saves me!!!  another interesting quote: "if women didn't exist, all the money in the world would have no money" Aristotle

      Today, i get to go to my cousin's hse and going there revive my interest in playing Gunbound. It has been six months since i last touch the game and i am pretty please tt i have not lost my touch( i am still as pro as ever ). it is quite funny tt some joker who got no avatars and it is very obvious tt i am more pro then him but still he continues to challenge me, hahaha. i luv all these stupid ppl!!!   then i went to clementi to eat claypot rice and for the second time, the bloody stall is close and i did not get to eat. @#$%^@#$  thus i got no choice but to go to Chicken Hse at Thomson to eat my fav chicken rice. the auntie there still can remember me and this must be bcos i frequent there when i study in RI. Next yr, when rj shift to bishan, i will surely go back there.   then the rest of the day is a blur as i just stone around at home, doing nothing. so so sian...... so here i am writing my second entry and waiting for 7pm to come to watch tv. hope the charity show tonite will be exciting   Here is a quote i find interesting: Most man can stand adversities but if u want to test his integrity, give him power - Lincoln

      This is my first time writing a blog and i am feeling very reluctant to do this. this is bcos i know i will start neglecting it very soon....( hope it is not tt soon =p ) but my dear fren, kp force me to keep my promise and so here i am, writing my first entry.  let's tok abt wat happen today. go to sch, watch video for gp, get back phy CT (get a measly 74 -- but quite happy though, it is an A after all). GP video is quite cool. i am getting inspired by it. it is abt the 'not so distant future' where ppl can change their gene and be genetically superior. i want to be the first to invent this kind of tech and then i gonna rule the world with my informidable genetically modified army!!!! now u know how ambitious i am...... just jk  after phy lect is chem prac which we do some stupid expt then i go home at 1230!!!! feel so shiok to leave sch while others all slogging in sch. (so sadistic i am). then the whole day is gone as i spend time reading my manga.  nothing more to write so i shld stop now. wait for the nxt entry!!!

      this past few weeks have been very busy. i am reaching home at abt 8 everyday. last week just have a mega concert which is for national day and it has been a very fun experience. playing in a 1800 strong orchestra is really exciting and the song night of electric wind is very nice especially the erhu part. i get to skip lessons which is really a bonus but sadly, i only get to skip phy and chem prac. wat is most maddening is tt i need to make up for both prac and it means i did not get to skip lesson at all. nothing much to write abt sch life except tt one of my classmate, harold just return from US and treat the class to loads of bubblegum.  today is national day celebration. it is very very boring and so i was very glad it is over very soon. my fren is smart not to come today. after tt, i go play pool with co frens and one of my ex classmates. we r exchanging gossip on the bus and i realise tt guys luv gossips too. play 3hrs straight of pool, win some lose some but overall i feel tt i am getting better at it. with more practice, i think i can be very good at it. i am going to catch a nap now, too tired after the game and not enough sleep yesterday( only 4 hours, spend my time watching spirited away)
