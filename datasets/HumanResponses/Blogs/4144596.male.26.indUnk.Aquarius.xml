       So, the project is off to a slow start.   urlLink Ebay  isn't being as forthcoming with cool project cars at a low cost as it has in the past; there's been a  urlLink Trabant  for sale on there, but it's a two-stroke engine and not the coolest of cars.  I know cool isn't the sole purpose of this project - in fact un-cool is kind of good - but come on, it's a Trabant.  Dad would disown me.  Local papers, ad trader thingy, Practical Classics magazine - all have come up blank.  There was a 60's BSA motorbike, in bits for the past 10 years, in the ad trader, but I can't ride a motorbike.  Would have been a decent project though, especially at £30.  No idea if all the parts were there or if it would ever go again - if it's in parts it's possible, likey even, that the engine components would have surface rust and would need machining.  You'd end up having to get the engine re-bored and skimmed and all sorts.  The costs would spiral and a lot of the work would be out of my league.  Raises the interesting possibility of getting a motorbike though - bound to be cheaper (although the cooler the bike/scooter, the more expensive - even knackered old Vespas go for a bomb now).  The possible solution I've been left with was raised by my housemate last night.  He rebuilds cars for racing and we were chatting about me getting a project car when he mentioned his business landlord has a  urlLink TR3  in need of restoration.  I'll see how difficult it's likely to be, and how much it'll cost, but it sounds tempting.  I mean, just look at the things:     Hubba hubba!  Bit frog-eye.  I'll let you know how I get on.

       So, a new day, a new blog.  I suppose the reason behind this is twofold; firstly, and to excuse myself setting this up at work, it's to demonstrate blogging to the people I work with because I think blogging could be a handy tool for us.  I won't go on about where I work because I don't see that I need to and no-one's going to  be that interested.  Suffice it to say I just wanted a safe blog where I could demonstrate some of the capabilities without the shock of opening up a random blog in a meeting only to be presented with pictures of monkeys doing rude things.  The other reason, and the more compelling one from my point of view, is that I have a project in mind and I wanted to log it in some way.  Paper's so passe, dharlings...  so here I am blogging it.   The project   The idea is I want a car to do up.  I already have my little baby MG midget (about which more later) and I want something which breaks more so I can spend more happy days in my garage elbow-deep in car entrails.  I want a thermos and, to be honest, the current reliability of Monty just won't justify it.  To make it more interesting I'm going to do what I can online.  eBay's the way to go, people.  More tomorrow!    Bought so far: Anglia Ad Trader - cost £1.50 Total costs £1.50
