      This will not be a shot on anyone's personal musical taste, but there are some people who listen to a lot of CRAP. So to fix this problem, that other people seem to have put themselves in, I will give a to do list.  First go here  urlLink itunes  and download it.  then go here  urlLink epitonic  pick the options stream this page, and expand your musical taste. Everything on this site will give you a better incite on how to have "good taste".

      So, here I sit...I'm kind of hungry, but I don't have anything in mind to do. So I will try to pass the time in my own way.  In two days I will be... carry the one plus two move the decimal two negatives make a positive  OLD.

      Are we in a parallel universe or something??  Anyway, so tomorrow I have creative writing and it will be interesting to see how my teacher reacts towards me.  Chris, you should check out my blog and see what you think of my response to her "appropriate" suggestions...  I worried that I might have been overworking that whole "bad girl" image of mine... ::smiles::  Night all!

      I just wanted everyone to know that I was still up.  So, what the fuck happened to Laura? Did she just decide not to blog anymore? Well I guess I can understand since she is getting married and stuff so she has a full plate...I guess she is off the hook for now.  Rori, I liked the writing assignment your teacher gave you, hope you enjoyed my response.  Night all.

      Today I heard something that made me think, it was that our place of employment no longer has a bike in there employment force. If only I could have seen this first hand...It's not that I doubt the word of my informant...It's just that I have had similar occasions before, where I was sure that the afore mentioned place of employment would have been bike free...and then the next fucking day there was the bike. So I think I will either try to get some details or go on the wait and see method. Sound good...Yeah, I thought so to.

I know how chicks dig guys with wooden limbs!z But wait a minute Mrs Lippy, the part of the story I don't like is where the boy gave up looking for the dog for only after an hour.  That boy's gotta think, you gotta pet, you got a responsibility.  You don't just give up looking, you get your ass out there and you find the fucking dog!

I think the reason I don't blog as much as I should is because I'm a lazy motherfucker.  That, or I don't have too much to say most of the time.  THAT, or I'm constantly censoring myself because I'm deathly afraid of what others will think - so I have to go back and re-do each blog about 10 times till I like it, and by that time Im so sick of it that I just don't even want to do it - so I end up all angsty, staring at the screen for 30 minutes till I need a cigarette.

      There's this passage I kinda got memorized that sort of fits the occaision, Ezekiel 25:17.  "The path of the righteous man, is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepards the weak through the valley of darkness. For he is truely his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children.  And I will strike down upon thee with great vengence and furious anger, those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.  And you will know my name is the lord, when I lay my vengence upon thee."

      You bring up a very interesting point, chris, about America's views of sexuality in adolescence.  We come from a society that has entire legions of men counting down to the day that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen turn 18, and worship a Birtany teen-sex-bad girl pictorial spread that appeared in Rolling Stone.  I also hear that a large portion of male-focused "porn" is centered around an expansive teen and "barely legal" base... But I wouldn't know about that sort of thing...  With this in mind, where are the ladies at? I cannot help but wonder where the 30-40 year old women are who are lusting after that kid from Malcom in the Middle? If you think about it, the stereotype for women in this arena is in their late 30's-40's with a male in his early to mid-twenties.   So let's assume these general points are true... Why do men lust after teenagers and women after young adults?

      So, on the great local news that we have here...One of the stations is really milking the shit out of a story that they did. The story is, of course, that older men want to have sex with younger teenage girls, who they first meet on the internet and then later come in contact with to hook up at the girls house, but instead of a girl, the men in question find a news crew. This is the main point of the story.  This is a rare type of story, because on the one hand you have the news crew.  A media based organization which is helping push the idea and the drive for society that only the young are attractive and worthy of the masses attention...i.e. Your pop rock model types like Brittany, Mandy, Jessica, and others...who not only sing, but also cover damn near every type of media such as...Internet, magazines, CD's, newspaper, and radio.  So when this is the image of what is sexy and attractive, and these types of girls are stereotyped as the epitome of what a teenage girl is...Are you at all fucking shocked when a man says "wait I could have sex with a teenage chick" and then a teenage girls on the internet says "yeah, come over to my house for a suck and a fuck." It just seems like such an unfair setup.  But on the other hand...  You have the older men who are supposed to have some fucking common sense...And how about a little fucking compassion, because these girls are not adults, therefore they can't be expected to think like adults, they may not be as naive as I was when I was a teenager, but still, that does not give anyone the right to take advantage of them...not to mention thinking with your brain instead of your dick to realize all the legal trouble...Plus, how fucking creepy is that to have never met someone before and expect the first time you see them to fuck'em...anyway...  I don't even know the point I was trying to make, so I'm going to go to bed.  This post: Fuck   = 6 Shit    = 1 Damn = 1  Teen  = 5  I liked the part where you called John Bunny-nose.

      You all have now made an extremely dangerous move in the progression of the blog movement.  Inviting the master coleslaw into the blogging activities can only be described as dangerous.  But, feel safe.  Because.....I've been climbing trees, all my life.  But not trees near overhead lines.  Because if you touch one of those lines, if your weight makes a branch touch one of those lines, that electricity can come right to you, and that can hurt, it may even kill you.  And climbing utility poles is really dumb.  And remember, always look up for climbing, and please, stay out of trees that are near overhead lines.

      I finally figured this crap out, with no thanks to you clowns.  Someone will have to tell me how to do this crap again.  Well, I'm feeling the pressure of posting a great blog so hear it goes...I was born into the Slaw family farming business back in the good old year of 1982 (I'm only 22 you crazy fuckers).  Summers at the Slaw family farm were always nice.  I'd help milk the chickens and watch the cows peck.  Or wait a minute, oh yeah, we didn't have animals, only grain.  So I helped grow the crops and kept a close eye on the roosters because we had a profitable rooster business with this local family called 'The Peters'.  Apparently they had a young daughter who absolutely loved roosters of any shape and size.  The daughter's name was 'Fonda'.  Fonda Peters loved roosters as previously mentioned.  When she was young, she used to grab the roosters and stroke them violently until they became 'physically ill'.  As the young girl Fonda matured, she eventually learned the proper way to treat a rooster.  She learned how to properly groom and care for her roosters.  However, she had so many roosters, that infection became rampant among the rooster community.  This infection was later to be determined as to what is now known as 'The Clap'.  The Clap as we now know it, was begun by the curiosity of Ms. Fonda Peter's favorite rooster which is now known to be referred to as 'Andy the Rooster'.  Andy the Rooster had spread his wings into a few too many chicken coops in his time, and had contracted the infectious disease from what scientists now call the species the 'BlockedTheRockALotumus'.  The species known as the 'BlockedTheRockALotumus'  seemed to have caused incessant liquifaction of the visual membanes of the poor, unfortunate 'Andy the Rooster'.  As Andy the Rooster dehydrated and lay dying from the incessant liquification of his visual membranes, he was able to share these last few words with the rooster loving Fonda Peters.  'Fonda' he said, 'I always loved to peck around your beautifully shapen feet, and when you think of me, I pray that you remember me for my more loving rooster characteristics although I was never fully able to share it because of contracting The Clap from what has been explained to me as the devil chickens.'  Sorry to create my first blog on such a down note, but I thought I might help the communication process if everyone knew where I was coming from.   Biography is soon to follow....

What is your  urlLink Duck type? ?..  But most importantly, what kind of  urlLink pointless thing  are you?  If I were to judge myself from these quizzes I am a mixture between a Phoenix, "Inventive" (what they're really saying is strange) duck, and a really big button that doesn't do anything.  Gee, that does a lot for a girl's self-worth.  Oh, and just to prove to the world that I am easily amused...Go on, poke  urlLink it .....

      First of all, I'd like to start off with a little piece of advice.  Lesson #1: While driving down the highway at 70 mph with both windows down and the back window open, never open a can of chew.  It flies all over you, the inside of the truck, and out the windows and just like that you've wasted $4.    Lesson #2: If you are ever at a store where you can't get what you want on the shelves because they keep it in the back room, it will take forFUCKINGever for someone to help you.  Take Best Buy for example.  They FUCKING SUCK AND I HATE THEM.  It's worth the extra money in shipping to order stuff over the internet.  I spent 20 minutes in there and the only person who offered help didn't work in that department and couldn't help me.  However, if you're hot and a chick, everyone in the store will come to your aid with those difficult to chose from AA batteries.  I'm going to blow that store up.  Lesson #3: If someone tells you where something is located, and you think you know where it is and try to find it, you won't find it.  Stovetop, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about sometimes.  I couldn't find either of the places you are talking about.  I wasted a 1/4 of a tank of gas driving around Gladstone.  I hate Gladstone traffic.  Why doesn't everyone just stay the fuck out of my way?  My personal lesson for the day:  I hate most all people my age and people younger than me.  I'm moving to Montana and starting my own militia against everyone I hate.  I'm going to call it 'The Holy Church of Coleslaw'.  From now on, everyone refers to me as 'Father Coleslaw'.  If you don't, you will be fucked up the ass by a lion from Kenya with epilepsy and then be shot.  I thought venting would make me feel better, but now I just want to kill someone even more.

      Once upon a time, when nuts and berries grew wild and free and grass was kept short with gleaming shears, a little tail wagged and our story began... Norma swatted again at the fly buzzing around her.  Her tail flew up and out and over and up again.  Her ears followed suit.  Louie glanced up from his meal to see the wagging of Norma's tail.  He interpreted the swat as a friendly wag and frolicked over to the fence. "Norma, my sweet!" he began but was interrupted by the little chirps of Viv and Micky, the newborn chicks. "Cheep chirp chiroo! Micky, get out!" cried Viv. "Chip cheep chirp!  I will not not not!" replied Micky obstinately. "Louie! Norma!" cried Viv.  "Olaf!"  She even applauded to the butterfly. Louie turned back to Norma, who had hopped up on the fence to see what all the fuss was about. "Oh dear," thought Louie, impressed by Norma's skills. Suddenly, (i.e. without warning) Olaf the butterfly began to laugh maniacally (as well as without restraint) "That is it!" yelled Olaf in a fake Polish accent.  "They are here!" He began to swoop around aimlessly in the air.  Viv and Micky fell silent.  Louie fainted.  Norma hopped off the fence and ate a nearby daisy. "That's right, Olaf," she said.  "We are here." Without another word, Norma gobbled up Olaf and continued grazing. Life went on. Unitl, of course, it stopped. At which time they ceased to exist and well anyway... The end. Wait, they lived happily ever after first. And then finally, the end!

      I've been reading over this article that argues that the first letter of your first name can reveal a lot about your sexual identity.  I thought you guys might get a kick out of this;  -R-  You are a no-nonsense, action-oriented individual.  You need someone who can keep pace with you and who is your intellectual equal the smarter the better.  You are turned on more quickly by a great mind than by a great body.  However, physical attractiveness is very important to you.  You have to be proud of your partner.  You are privately very sexy, and like a sexual partner who can dominate and explore all of your sexual desires.  Sex is important; you can be a very demanding playmate.   -J-      You can be very romantic, attached to the glamour of love.  Having a partner is of paramount importance to you.  You are free in your expression of love and are willing to take chances, try new sexual experiences and partners, provided it's all in good taste.  Brains turn you on. You must feel that your partner is intellectually stimulating, otherwise you will find it difficult to sustain the relationship.  You require loving, cuddling, wining, and dining to know that you're being appreciated.   -C-  You are a very social individual, and it is important to you to have a relationship.  You require closeness and togetherness.  You must be able to talk to your sex partner before, during, and after.  You want the object of your affection to be socially acceptable and good looking. You see your lover as a friend and companion.  You are very sexual and sensual, needing someone to appreciate and almost worship you. When this cannot be achieved, you have the ability to go for long periods without sexual activity. You are an expert at controlling your desires and doing without.

      Ok, so next time you're in line what you need to do is make sure you're buying things that fit or go together, so when you leave the store the people who you are waiting in line with will know exactly what you are going to do...My suggestions are a twenty four pack of toilet paper and a big jar of metamusal. Or if you're in walmart buy a shovel, 50 gallon trash bags, a hacksaw, and shotgun ammo.  That would definitely make people uneasy.   I'm pretty sure if I saw that in line I wouldn't get all pissy about a little rubber divider.

      I want to know why it is that every time I go to Target and place my few items on the belt, some paranoid soccer mom gets uneasy about the separation of our things?  They never seem to have those little space bars at the registers and it seriously seems to freak people out.  This woman kept scooting her things forward, as if my eyebrow pencil and thigh-highs were somehow going to taint her Easter candy and vitamins.  So can anyone tell me what the proper "line edict" is when one is missing the divider?  Apparently I make others uneasy with my current routine...

      No, you don't have to record that for me. It sounds like I've seen that one before.  Is that the one where the main female character is in some kind of trouble? Or maybe she has some sort of revenge/adventure objective? At any rate girls humping guys belly button just doesn't do it for me.  But thanks for thinking of me.

      I'm sitting here watching one of those porn movies they show on HBO late at night.  You know, the ones with bad actors with stupid story lines and lots of fake fucking.  So anyway, as I'm watching this chick bounce around on this guy's belly button, I begin wondering how these guys don't get a hard on.  I don't think I could do that (like you all care).  Are they all gay?  They finally finish, at the same time coincidently, and they are lying in bed and begin arguing.  Why do they always argue in these kind of movies after fucking?  The picture always looks the same.  Are they required to use a certain camera type while shooting these kinds of movies?  Why is it, that the main female character is always the last chick to get naked?  Why doesn't it ever rain when they are outside?  Why is there always a pool or hot tub scene?  Am I leaving anything out here?  By the way, should I record this movie for stovetop in case he doesn't follow my tips and chooses the porn route instead?

      Coleslaw's secrets for solving a crisis:  Day One 1. Get drunk 2. Get crazy- Do something absolutely crazy so you will worry about it the next day instead of what you were worrying about to begin with.  Preferably this won't end with "...And I was cuffed and put in the back seat."  Day Two 1.  Lay in bed all day the next day worrying about what you did the night before.  Don't eat anything.  Day Three 1.  Wake up 2.  Eat 3.  Go do something- It will make you feel better to be awake and doing something productive since you wasted a whole day laying in bed.  Day Four 1.  Get drunk and repeat the day 2 and 3.

      Wow! That sounds like a great plan, but I'll modify it a little.  Rori's "Modified" Recipe for Success~  1.  Beer - (Forget all problems and drink myself into submission) 2.  Porn - (take my mind off of regular problems and create new situation for "doin it") 3.  Box of tissues - (Same as on previous list, but different usage in mind)

      I found it!  My car was off of 12th street in someone's driveway... Yeah I don't know either...  Anyway Stovetop, since you are having a crisis, I have decided to give you my patented crisis reliever...  Rori's Recipe for Success~ 1. Chickflik- ( I prefer The Bridges of Madison County or Steel Magnolias) 2. Chocolate covered cheesecake bites 3. Box of tissues  Now don't hold back because of your societal masculinity, there's a lot that a naked Clint Eastwood can fix. ::smiles::  (Clint Eastwood gets naked in The Bridges of Madison County... I thought I should let you in on that as I'm sure that neither of you have ever seen it ::big wink::)

      Hrmmm, thanks for the advice Stovetop, I think I will have an advil...  So I just walked outside to get my CD's out of my car, and there is no car there.  I just assumed that I drove myself home last night, and well, you know what they say about assumptions...  I am now frantically trying to get my hung-over friends out of bed to assist in my quest for my vehicle.  If you guys see a white Honda who looks a little lost, will you let her know to call home? ::sighs and shakes her head::

Or maybe you could just a advil.

      It's 11am and I feel fine, because I haven't had a beer in 3 weeks! (It feels like 3 months) My body hurts pretty bad though. I could barely get out of bed this morning from way too much excercise in the past few days.  I'm not sure there's a muscle on my body that doesn't hurt, oh wait, my ear is feeling alright.  But then again, my ear isn't a muscle.  Aspirin is my best friend today!  I spent about 5 hours trying to organize my cd player last night, with a little help from pepsi, and it still isn't finished!  I'm on the verge of having to buy another one to hold all of my cds.  I am now finished typing a bunch of bullshit that no one cares about.  Sorry to hear about your crisis Stovetop.

      10:34 in the morning hurts after a dizzying 13 hour drunken free-for-all.  I can barely open my eyes and my head feels like someone is repeatedly drilling the back of my skull with a jack-hammer.  I vaguely recall getting into a yelling match with my ex-boyfriend and a guy throwing a 24 pack of beer at my friend Lisa's chest...The rest is all a little hazy...   There is no vacation time available today, and I exhausted my store of sick time many moons ago... This all works together to make me a very sad panda...

      Ode to Metamucil  If it wasn't for you,  I couldn't go poo. I take four a day,  Regular, I will stay.  Before I met you,  I had trouble going doo doo. But now, I poop like a champ, Not so much as a cramp.  My poop fills the toilet, My underwear, I don't soil it. The many pounds I've lost, You're worth the cost!  Euphoria, you help me achieve, I just lost 10 pounds, I do believe.  So to you I give praise, For my glory days. Because of you I won an award, If someone stole you I'd offer a reward.  Does anyone know a good publisher??

      Having spent many, many restless days in the past three years picking away at popcorn kernels stuck in the soles of my shoes, washing out the grease of it from my hair, and smelling like it for days on end, I believe I now know enough about this "wonderful" snack to write a little something in its honor...   Ode to Popcorn...  Oh, Popcorn, you're so hot, As you burn and sizzle in the kettle pot.   You smell like butter on a summer's day, That doesn't really make sense but anyway...   Your yellow glow warms my heart, As your greasy oil stains my shirt.   With oil and heat and stirring you 'pop!' And some of it jumps out and burns me right in the freakin' face--   Ahem.   Popcorn, popcorn, what would I do, If I didn't have to smell like you.  All day long I reek of your scent, I forgot what good cleanliness meant.   You munch and crunch,  My day away, As I sit doing alarms, And turn old and gray.   About the stupid customers, Who complain about price, I wish I could smack them, That would be nice.   I can eat popcorn one by one, Or handfulls at a time. I love your buttery goodness, I wish you only cost a dime.   Popcorn, pocorn, my bestest friend, Threatening my complexion till the bitter end.

      I opened up the Manila envelope as quickly as I could, hoping that it was an unexpected Christmas present. I reached in, and to my displeasure, pulled out what appeared to be a dead cat.  The cat had a Post-it-note on it that read "How many Pollocks does it take to kill your cat?  That bastard! I knew he was going to try to get me back for sleeping with his mom. As quickly as I could, I ran over to the cabinet and pulled out a large white envelope. I then proceeded to pull my pants down to my knees, squat, and took a shit in the envelope which I was holding open with both hands. Sealing it, however, was a problem. I should have purchased self-adhesive envelopes because getting my tongue close enough to lick the envelope almost made me lose my lunch. Finally, though, I persevered and addressed the envelope, but not before I dropped a Post-it-note inside that read "Shits-n-giggles. Oops! Forgot the giggles."  Once I had mailed the envelope, I started to ponder my decision.  It actually was pretty shitty of me to sleep with his mom. God, what did I have to go and do that for?  Upon acknowledging my mistake, I grabbed the jug of Kool-Aid out of the fridge and ran back down to the mailbox. When I was about half way done pouring the jug into the slot in an attempt to destroy the mail, I heard a loud voice. "What the hell do you think you are doing?"  Unfortunately, all I could think to say to the cop was "Kool-Aid". Apparently that wasn't the correct answer because before I knew it I was lying on the ground handcuffed. "You're a real dipshit, aren't you, son?" The cop continued.  What a stupid question to ask. Does he really expect me to answer yes? "Yes sir, I am a dipshit. What gave it away?" I responded in order to appease him.  He was not appeased.  I figured I was already in about as much trouble as I could get in, and was also experiencing some butt-itching due to my neglecting the use of toilet paper. With nothing to lose I started squirming around singing "Let's get physical, physical, I wanna get physical, let's get into physical!" I couldn't remember any more of the words though, so I just kept singing the same part over and over again until the cop grabbed me and stood me up.  "Quit humping the sidewalk!" he ordered. I ran over to the mailbox and started humping it while adlibbing new words to the same song.  Eventually, the cop escorted me and my half full Kool-Aid jug to the police car. Once he had me sitting, he dumped out the remaining Kool-Aid and threw the container in beside me. He looked really mad, and this sort of scared me into acting normal for a while. But about half way to the police station I finally yelled out "I'm warning you, I can go from zero to bitch in 6 seconds flat!"  The cop didn't even turn around.  I'm not sure whether he thought I was crazy or that I was just fucking with him, but all I do know at this point is that I'm handcuffed, covered in Kool-Aid, and someone is getting a package full of shit.  My spring break starts...Now.

      Did you know that the average Blue Whale produces 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, but only 10% of that makes it into his mate?  This means that for every male Blue Whale having sex, there are 360 gallons of sperm that are left behind in the water...  Makes one think twice about getting a mouth full of ocean water...

      How do you know when you've taken a really good dump?  I'm not just talking about euphoria, oh no, it's much more than that.  Let me share a little story with you all.  So I was dropping off the Cosby's, but you probably figured as much already, when I thought, 'Hey, that was a good one!'  So I looked back into the toilet.  This is when I realized how good it was.  The poop had coiled up in the toilet hole, filled it up, and was sticking up out of the water!  When your poop goes beyond the water level, you know you've lost some serious weight.  I now present myself with the 'poop of the month' award.  For my acceptance speech, first I must thank Metamucil and their wonderful inventors.  Second, I'd like to thank Planters for helping add 'texture' (if you know what I mean) to the poop.  Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank God (you always have to when receiving an award) because without him, poops like this would never be possible!

I was wondering what movies were coming out this summer and found some interesting sequels.  If I knew how to post a link I would, but I don't so fuck you.  Anyway, coming out is 'Meet the Fockers', 'Mission Impossible 3', another Spider-man, 'Oceans 12', and 'The Life and Times of Coleslaw' with Coleslaw making his acting debut.  I'm always the last to find stuff out so maybe yall already knew all of this.  If you do, you can kiss my ass.

Victim:  I'm not sure, I just looked down and it was bleeding.  EMT 2:  OH Shit!!!!!! You're dead!!! You are dead as fucking fried chicken!!! I'm definitely kicking your ass now!  EMT 1:  I don't think I can hold this EMT back any longer...You better start talkin'!  Victim:  I guess I fell?  EMT 2:  Uh huh! That's right you fell bitch. That's what I thought.                                                                  Off screen later EMT 1 speaks to EMT 2   EMT 1:  Don't you think you were a bit over the top back there?  EMT 2:  Man, I saved that guy life!!! I'm like a God!  EMT 1:  No, your not like a God, you have to put your pants on one leg at a time just like him.  EMT 2:  Yeah I guess you're right. (in hushed and muffled tones) I'll kill you.  EMT 1:  What? Did you say something?  EMT 2: No man, You must be hearing things.  (even more hushed and muffled tones) I'll kick your dog.

      Well, we chose the animals based on demeanor rather than a physical comparison.  Basically, if your personality could be re-created as an animal, what would it be?  We chose Asian Elephant for you Stovetop,(after a lot of deliberation) because they seem to have a certain quiet understanding of the world that we felt complimented your own.  Now, how we came to an Asian Elephant rather than an African elephant is much more amusing...  Laura: "So would he be an Asian or African Elephant?" Rori: "Asian...Definitely Asian." Laura: "Yeah, smaller ears."  ...Yeah, I'm not really sure either, but it made complete sense at the time.  John, there was some fierce debate as to whether you would be a Goat or a Horse put out to pasture.  I was rooting for goat...

And I will take it in the rain.  And in the dark and on a train.  And in a car and in a tree.  It's so good, so good you see!  So I will take it in a box, And I will take it with a fox.  And I will take it in a house, and I will take it with a mouse.  And I will take it here and there.  Say! I will take it anywhere!  I do so like green eggs and meth!  Thank you! Thank you, Sam I am!

      How does one gather people for an orgy?  Are you sitting around with your friends one day and then make a group decision to get some people together and screw?  Do you post advertisements?  Is it appropriate to send out invitations and hand out party favors? What about snacks, you know people might work up and appetite? What if there's that one random girl who screams and flails about in the heat of passion, or a guy who ceaselessly bellows "Who's your daddy," wouldn't you laugh? Laughing probably isn't appropriate at orgy's...  Well obviously and orgy is too much work... Just hit the meth...

      Well, I just finished my pyscho cleaning rampage after drinking half of a 2liter of pepsi. It wasn't just a cleaning, it was a 'HOLY SHIT THAT'S FUCKING CLEAN' cleaning. At the moment, I am chasing my tail round and round in circles. I've had a really productive day! I even went down to the park and ran 2 miles (before the pepsi). And now to celebrate, I'm going to drink a...oh ya, nevermind. Shit. I think I'll pound my head on my keyboard for a while azxcvsd;fkjoasfdkj'asdf;jlk asdlqwerouiyzxcmvbzalfjk'asdfklj  asd56f4j654k'la65s1dfl651k'j7aeio[wrqu 23480as;oiurd5238470

      Jesus, you guys are a bunch of morose bastards today... Let's see, today I spent the morning giving myself a facial, manicure and pedicure session.  No school, so I leisurely made my way to work.  After a decent day at work I won some stupid game, so now Green Goblin has to dispatch for me for 15 min on Thursday.  I then got to leave early with VTO... Oh, and everyone loved my hair... Ahhh...   And the night's still young...

      Today I've been getting some shit done, which means I had to skip a class, so I could get some of the more important elements of my day complete...Like studying for classes that I'm going to have fucking horrible midterms for and burning CD's, but I burned some quality shit like The Velvet Underground, Ramones, X-ray Spek, Sex Pistols, Bikini Kill, and some Bad Religion...There were others, but those are the highlights. The rest of my day was spent doing laundry, going to the bank, and cleaning my apartment...That's some pretty exciting stuff...Where has my creativity gone? Let me see...I will now type the most creative thing that comes in my head...Beef...Stew... Well that's something.

      So today was my day to sleep in late and what time to I get up?  Fucking 8:00am.  Isn't that a bunch of crap.  I went and got my truck inspected and my tags renewed.  Do you ever notice how there is always some kind of bullshit when you go to the license bureau?  Usually it something with all the stupid proof of this and proof of that they require.  This time, I had all my shit and the fuckers won't take a plastic payment.  I had to go to the closest atm to get money.  That atm charged me $1.50 along with my bank charging me $1.50....So let's do some math here.....ummm.....hmmm....oh yea! that equals 3 fucking dollars because of those assholes.  That's almost a can of chew, almost a 6 pack of natty, or a blowjob from the bike!  So I getting ready to write my congressman and tell him that the state of MO owes me one of these 3 things, preferably a can of chew because I don't need a blowjob from the bike because as we all know chlamydia (i looked that one up) is not a flower!  So now I don't have shit to do and I'm bored out of my mind.  I just called stovetop but he isn't home.  I decided I felt like being 'impaired' of some sort.  Since I'm not drinking beer anymore, I decided to get a 2-liter of pepsi and get all fucked up!  Look out closets, bathroom floors and anything else I can go crazy cleaning!  Ok, this is enough bullshit for now.  Sorry you all have to suffer through my boredom with me!

      I was just thinking....Have you ever noticed how the word 'virgin', kinda looks like ver-gin (gin pronounced like 'again')?  If it was meant to be said this way, why isn't it spelled 'virjin'?  Just a thought I'm sure you all have pondered at one time or another.  Since we're on the topic of deep thoughts, why isn't paper-rock-scissors an olympic event?  It's competitive, it's of course dangerous because as we all know scissors cuts paper, and the ever life threating event of being 'covered by paper'.  We can't leave out being smashed by a rock!  With all of the emminent danger and carnage involved, I'm sure we could get Budweiser sponsorship.  I've been practicing for many a years, suffered a few injuries and set backs in my career, but when the time comes, I'm going for the GOLD!!!

      So John, I hear you're the most popular guy on your block with the over thirty crowd.  You could be like "The Friend" to their son that they want to fuck, maybe they'd even want to "do it" in the mini-van...you know, the one with the soccer sticker on the back.    Ok, that's all the shit I'll give you about that (for a while).   But seriously, If you find that your "lady friends" are having a hard time staying at your pace, you know, cause of a broken hip or something, here is a site you might need in the future...  urlLink John's future women   Night all

      So Rori and I were discussing tonight, I could be the reincarnation of Jesus and not know it.  If I was, that would mean the second coming is already here but no one knows it.  That's right, I'm here to fight evil!  Rori wanted me to prove it by performing a miracle by filling her water bottle, but then later changed her mind when I was going to fill it with 'yellow water'.  How do you feel about this Stovetop?

Hey Rori, have you slept in a while? Cause last night I didn't. If I'm catching what you and Aaron have I will be very unhappy...Because up till now sleep has been my friend, and I'm not willing to let him/her go without a fight.

      You know, I've never seen a Rocky movie all the way through. I guess I should put that on my "Oh my god! You haven't seen that?!?" list.  We are in the heart of mid-term season and I am struggling with my Latin paper.  I've got six pages stretched thin and I need ten.  Honestly, at this point I have abandoned all grammatical and structural understanding.  Soon I'm going to resort to typing words or phrases that even sound remotely Latin.  Anyway... It's gonna be a long night.

      I got home just in time for the Rocky movie marathon.  Woohoo!!  I missed the first one, got to see the end of the second one, and now the third one is starting!  Got a tape in the vcr ready to go!  Rocky movies were my favorite when I was little and I wanted to be just like Rocky.  Everytime they'd play it on tv, my dad would always tell me they changed the ending to make him lose and I'd get mad.  But of course he didn't lose.  Good story!  Where did all the bloggers go?

I start to read over it again and again, picking it apart until I finally decide that it's complete crap and contemplate just deleting the stupid thing... but I don't... I decide not to let my blog insecurities beat me and I just continue to freakishly check this stupid thing to see when someone else will post, and I can stop having a fucking panic attack!

      I wonder at the Baby Black Market would it kind of be like the pound? Little cages in which they might have to do tricks to be taken. Would the owners just lay down some newspaper and call it day? Little bowls full of cheerios and apple juice? And all the older ugly ones might be taken in back to be....no...i can't say it...its even too far for me....they'd probably have to have a front business like--a butcher shop-or maybe to reach the appropriate clintele--one of those ritzy weird shops where they have matching clothes for moms and daughters...i'd bet they'd be saps to buy babies. they'd have to know the password though...  Rori...I loathe you....why'd you make me go out on Sunday? you know I had a shit load of stuff to do...now I'm all paranoid about shit. I'M GOING TO FAIL!!!! well at any rate, good luck at your familes today!  John--I  picture you with a walker and it makes me giggle...you'd have to put the little tennis balls on them so you wouldn't  slip though...maybe an oruugga horn so people can get out of your way when you start in there direction.

      I like the idea of walking down some low-end city street at night when suddenly, a shifty-eyed stranger jumps out in front of you.  He's wearing a black trenchcoat and no shoes.  In a voice thick with cigarette smoke and a mouth containing teeth that have been rotted from crack use, he croaks "Lookin' for babies?"  Dismayed by the man's question you jump back and shriek " Babies?  You mean like those "black market" babies?" You shake your head and begin to cover your mouth before the words even cross your lips, hoping... No wait... praying that it just isn't so.  You've heard about these baby smugglers...  They run the puppies out of those puppy farms and make them into baby farms.  Just acres and acres and acres of em'...  You're mind quickly stops babbling as the man opens his coat to reveal a selection of attatched babies.  You quirk your head and realize that the one in the little red jumper matches your purse and new shoes perfectly.  Quickly you move through the streets with you're newest accessory... a hot baby... (not hot like sexy hot or anything, I meant hot like stolen "hot."  You know?  Don't people still say that? Alright... bugger off, the lot of ya'!)

      So, baby smuggling huh. Yes I can see it now, a dirty pool hall and in the back behind a series of doors there is a man in a penstriped suit with other men around him, some with blood on their shirts.  When I think of the black market babies I think of China Town...To bad Kansas City doesn't have a China Town. We need a China Town, How the fuck are we supposed to get a China Town. John isn't your mom Chinese? You better call her and have her set something up. Pronto.

      The Author would also like to enquire after the black market trade of babies.  The Author ponders how one would...ahem... "Get into" the business of baby smuggling.  It's kinda funny to think about it, you know, I picture some guy with a wheel barrel full of babies, tiptoeing through the night to drop them off at the local baby smuggling joint.  There's some guy on the corner waiting for a couple who looks like they need a baby.  And of course they would always try to give away the faulty baby first, you know, the one with a gimp leg or something.  So yeah... Baby smuggling... Think about it...

      I called in to work at 12:20 this afternoon to see if I could swipe up a vacation spot for the day.  The gentleman said they had just given the last spot away at noon...  I was awake at noon... That person could have been me... If I weren't so damn busy trying to get my eyes to open and some sort of moisture into my mouth I could have enjoyed the horrible hammer which is ceaselessly pounding at my temples in the comfort of my apartment.  So...Um...yeah... The moral of this story is..eh...Call into work before you pass out...or maybe...it was something about a teapot. hrmmm... Wasn't there a moralistic expression involving a teapot? Oh no...no, I'm thinking of something totally different... I think it's something about worms and bees, or birds maybe... I don't really know...

So anyway does anyone know how much living in a one bedroom apartment with a roommate sucks?  One of the problems about having a one bedroom apartment with a roommate is that you're never really alone. That's something that you just don't think will be a big deal, but it is. This constant other person roaming around in your space, you're trying to do something and they are right there. I can only imagine this is what john goes through with his dad, but a least John has a house with separate rooms to hide in.  I can't wait to have my own room again, even if it is full of all my shit.

Do you ever feel as though you are acting outside of yourself... and you take it out on someone and you know you probably shouldn't...because you realize what you're yelling for is a stupid reason?!? yet you press on in that baby tantrum sort of way? well...it fuels the fire when no on pays attention to it...in fact Josh is sleeping through my tantrum...I don't know if any one knows about this or has had similar situations...but i'm about 2 seconds away from doing that lay down on the floor and wail and kick my arms and legs around thing to get someone to fucking notice! whew! needed to get that out-  ...that was an ugly color of me...

I like that they included  homestar runner and bill cosby. that was a good time... at any rate I guess i can't put off the inevitable.... hope everyone is having a good week.

      First let me say, Damn that was a good story. No No that was a GREAT story. I was captivated by the part where your dad's girlfriend saw your junk. Because now she can compare and contrast between father to son. Oh no I've said too much, I've gone too far.  Still funny

      A great story for everyone....  I was feeling that certain pressure and decided to relieve it.  There I was dropping a load and went to wipe and realized there wasn't any toilet paper.  So, with my pants around my ankles, I got up and bent over to get another role from underneath the sink.  I didn't know until it was too late, that I had a dingleberry hanging down and then it fell and landed in my pants that were around my ankles.  I thought, 'No problem, I'll just go get another pair of underwear and shorts because no one was home.'  So I took my shorts off carefully not to spill the dropling onto the floor and opened the door.  As I opened the door with no pants on, there was my dad's girlfriend walking up the stairs with the junk right at eye-level.  I hadn't heard her come in the front door.  As I went to cover up the boys in my embarassment, I accidently missed and hit myself in the junk.  In agony, I fell to my knees moaning while covering up my genitals.  Realizing the embarassing situation we were both in, she apologized and went back downstairs.  After regaining the feeling in my legs and ignoring the pains shooting up my stomach, I went to my closet, got some new shorts and underwear and went and cleaned up in the bathroom.  Afterwards, we all had a Heineken and laughed.

      It's been a while since I've blogged so let me start my return by giving you all something to think about...  Apparently, one in five people in the world are Chinese.  And there are five people in my family, so it must be one of them.  It's either my sister Mary or my dad, but not my Mom because she's Cambodian. Maybe it's my younger brother Ho-Cha Chu.  But I'm pretty sure it's Mary.  And by the way, thank god it's baseball season again!

      Oh Stovetop... Sarah letting you impregnate her, now that's the funny part! ::slaps her knee::  Anywho, so early on Sunday morning I feel down aarons hill.  I cant even remember why I was walking down the stupid hill, but I do clearly remember walking down the hill, hearing a large crack as my knee turned and pain...Lots of pain.  Sunday afternoon I spent most of the day at the pool soaking up the rays.  So as I enter work today, I'm sure everyone will notice my limp, fire red skin, and strange outfit(because of my lack of focus on laundry.)Jesus, it's good to be me.  Sarah, quit chopping off orc's heads... Chris, quit spreading your intergalactic seed...  Sheesh, I leave you people alone for one day ::shakes her head::

      Rori, it's best that you hear it from me...The reason that Sarah needs you to call her is because (are you ready for this)...(I hope you're sitting down)...The future me went back in time and spread my "seed".  Now Sarah is pregnant with the future "Bad Stovetop's" baby. There will be a bounty for the head of any of my future offspring so, she (of course) will be buying a sword not just for the Orc killing, but also so she can collect the money from the head of her future child...Then she will turn it into the government AKA. Mr. John Rankin.    How could you do that to me....Oh Sarah...Well, it's ok...I forgive you.

      I need serious help. I've just got done watching the lord of the rings-return of the king for the 3rd time in 2 days. that's wrong and sick. i've become immune to the sad sissy parts-and have become more used to the carnage. the ending the first time i watched it last nite at 2 o'clock made me sob like a baby...today, not even a single tear. i already looked online and priced swords. next thing you know i'll be going around cutting off orc heads left and right...and since there is no such thing as orcs in real life...ugly midgets best beware!!!  I think i might have to give the movie a break for awhile and join the living... I'm off to my friend Adam's with Josh to play poker. I hope that all is well with  everyone else!  P.S. Rori when you read this...call me!!!! I have something to tell you.

      I have just decided that school is not for me...Instead I am going to become an intergalactic time traveler.  I will travel to interesting new foreign lands meet interesting new people and kill them.  I will become the first person to become a wanted man on more than one planet.  Plus this will give me the chance to spread my "seed" across the universe.  The government of course will realize what I'm doing and try to stop me.  So, they will set up a new government bureau to watch me and monitor my movement across time and space.  The leader of this new group will be one Mr. John Rankin AKA "the time stopper guy".    Yep, that is going to be my new job.

      I've decided I want a pet Grimace.  A little two foot tall replica of our original beloved purple Mcdonalds friend.  My mini-grimace would purr, and fetch sticks, and go change the channel when I couldn't find the remote.  I would sew him a special Grimace-bed, and make sure he had all the Grimace-food that his little Grimace-heart could desire.  I would take him to the vet for his yearly Grimace-shots, and train him to viscously Grimace-attack anyone I commanded him too.  Of course, my roommates would force me to allow them to get my little Grimace high, so we would giggle as the little fellow stumbled around muttering angrily about the Hamburgler...

      Do you know what I hate about roommates?  I hate it that when I wake up late and it is imperative that I take a shower now, they choose this exact time to have a lengthy phone conversation in the bathroom.  I can hear the fan going, so I assume once this roommate actually does get out, that there will also need to be a 20 lag time for ventilation purposes... Oh great... Now the showers going... *sighs and shakes her head* I just have to make it to December... With the extra income they afford me, I suppose I'll just have to buy my happiness until then.  Just about all moved in, aren't you boys?

Not that we don't get enough of that at work.  But yes, for you Rori I will change the scrolling text.

      Things just aren't the same at work without Laura. Yesterday, she was sadly escorted out, but her boxes they left open. I hissed when anyone neared the table, for I shall created a memorial to the greatest operator of our times.  its really quite bullshit that she got fired. it makes me sad. I thought i was going to get an ulcer- i had a bad feeling all day long. Then I got a critical fail to make things worse. anyway enough about work... Laura- if you read this call me about this weekend...  And John- you crack me up. I'm glad to see you back on the blog. And that whole apology shit is unnessary- you've done nothing to be sorry for. Forget about it- note how I keep my un-ethnic flair. because that's what i like to do...and it might intrest you to know, cult brother...that they've changed bomb pops- now they have all sorts of crazy shit and colors over there. its pandemonium in the freezer aisle. And about the arsenio thing...we'll have to take that to a vote...  Well, I hope that everyone is having a good day. Rori hope you feel better.

There's vacation time available, why not? So if no one hears from me it's because I'm sleeping... So yeah... I really had the intention of making this an interesting post, but sadly...

      You fuckers...I was playing a little catch up and read how I am now a breast.  Fuck you.  I'm not a breast.  If I were to be a woman's body part, I think I would be the adam's apple.  How fucking smart am I?  Notice my use of the word fuck?  I'm starting my own fuck tally.  Anyway, things that make me fucking mad...I had a jager craving, went to the fucking freezer and it was gone.  Somewhere in the haze of the last 24 hours somebody drank my fucking jager.  When I find out who it is, I'm going to do something really fucking violent.  Maybe I'll do something....I'm not feeling violent right now so I'm running out of shit to say.  Anyway, July 1st is the big day...the day I probably go insane and kill everyone I see.  I'm rambling...A new piece of the puzzle was found today.  I went to Dad's and was doing laundry and found a pair of mongo's shorts...so here's what we got, I got drunk, blacked out, took my shorts and boxers off, got in the shower with my shirt on, somewhere I put on mongo's shorts, woke up in bed at my apartment wearing my own shorts.  Things that make you go hmmm...that's right, I'm quoting Arsenio.  Sarah, I think Arsenio should some how be involved in our cult.  I'm proof reading and covering up one eye because I'm seeing double.  That being said, I'd like to make a confession.  I confess that I still have my foreskin.  I'm going to have it removed and bring it to work and put it on Rori's desk.  Man, that is some sick shit, where did that come from.  I really don't have my foreskin, I was taken from me many years ago.  If I still had my foreskin, I would probably try to use it as a getting laid tactic.  We all know I could use a little help in that department anyway.  Holy poop I'm rambling a lot.  What else can I say...Next month I'm going in for surgery to have my belly button filled in.  I think they're going to insert a small beer keg for in case of emergency.  Doctor's orders, I can't argue with it.  It's bullet proof and can withstand 3 atomic bomb blasts.  It's experimental so there is always risks.  God forbid it should leak...that could be disasterous.  I'm running out of crazy shit to say.  I'm going to go smoke a cigarette while I'm still nicotine dependent.  I should think about sleeping also since I work in 9 hours.  Shit.  I just said the "W" word.  Once again, refering back to the list, that is also in the top 5, if not number 1.  OK, bye!

      So I've been drunk now for over 24 hrs.  I don't like it.  I'm tired of feeling this way.  Here I am, blogging like a champ.  Haven't been here in a while but I've still got the touch.  It's like riding a bike...ooops, bad analogy.  Speaking of analogies, have you ever noticed how that has the word "anal" in it?  It has nothing to do with bums.   On a heavier note, I watched the video from the party the other night.  If I were looking for reasons to kill myself, that would be in the top 5.  Fogetaboudit.  So to those I owe apologies to, I'm sorry (Sarah).  Once again, I must gracefully bow out of the cheese sandwich industry because I'm an animator.  I must now leave yall because I must go to Compton to be with my homies.

      Sarah, you are a wonderful comment poster, and I would love to go to the drive in sometime.    I bought some books yesterday, David Sedaris's new one and The Davinci Code. I will read them as fast as humanly possible and get back to you all on them. Hugs and kisses.

      Wow Chris... I think that maybe some meditation might clear up some of that aggression you've got there... ::pat pat pat:: 1...2...3 alright then.    I'm sorry that I haven't been paying adequate attention to the blog and I promise to work hard to do better.  I will wake up each day and furrow my brow in my determined search for my next attempt at wit while scouring the internet to find sites to entertain the masses.  With this new life force I will dedicate every ounce of my being to making this the most fan-fucking-tastic web blog IN THE WORLD!  Fuck tally: 1  (see, you don't have to say fuck to get your fucking point across Chris...fuck... ::smiles:: )  (oh, and yes, the labeling of John as a breast was a derivative from a line in the major motion picture, The Birdcage. You are correct dear)

      I heart the Birdcage...it makes me happy. I also heart apple pie- of which I've had 3 slices. Looks like extra jazzercise for me today. I hope that everyone is having a good Sunday. Rori...I think your posts are beautiful...and hey Chris! I post!- well, sometimes I post...sometimes I don't. Well I at least sort of post- which is more that I can say for John and Laura...  I think I'm going to go see the last harry potter movie today. i love going to the movies in the summertime-it makes me happy  John wants us all to go the drive in some Sunday- I think that would be alot of fun...so I think we should do it. there... that's my two cents thrown in the pile...how do you like that?

Shit, I don't even fucking know if she has a fucking computer any-fucking-more...And if she fucking does she must be doing some kind of motherfucking boycott against "THE-fucking-MAN" know what I'm fucking saying?  so far, fucks per paragraph:  16 Shit: 1  and yes I am sensitive

      Hey that's from the Birdcage...Right? The quote about the walking breast...It's from the Birdcage...Right? Am I right...I think I'm right...Unless I'm not. Then I will also have to "fling myself onto my bed in mock tantrum" you know, if I'm not right about the quote from the Birdcage.  But I'm pretty sure I might, maybe possibly be right...Or maybe wrong.

      You know, sometimes I feel like were all involved in this unspoken competition to see who can hold out the longest to post on this blog.  I often find myself thinking, "Well fine, I was the last one who posted so it's someone elses turn..."  or sometimes I think "What if I am posting too much?  They're all going to think I'm a big loser and all I do is post on this stupid blog."  These thoughts cause me to go crazy and fling myself onto my bed in mock tantrum... I then comfort myself with bon bons and talking about my feelings with those close to me... Especially Chris... 'Cause he's such a sensitive guy... but not as sensitive as John, who is practically a walking breast...

      it looks good Chris! I almost felt I was in the wrong place. Hope that everyone is well. Sorry its been awhile since I've  posted...my computer was fucking up again. Well everyone will be happy to know that i've retired my geriatics workouts in exchange for peppy ones with girls named Skipper. I did this aerobics thing yesterday and today I feel like my muscles are going to divorce me. I still couldn't get my lefts and my rights down rori, you would have laughed. at any rate, I'm off to be masochistic and try it again.   -Sarah  p.s. is it really neccessary for all aerobic instructors to wear the spandex biker shorts with the thong leotard over it...i mean really...that settles it...i am going to get those leg warmers with the matching headband. We'll become bestest buds, LYLAS!

      Well your worlds have yet to fall apart, because I am currently still employed with adt.  My manager didn't even seem to notice that he had to, again, forward me a little time. Chris, we can go chopping whenever you like, whatever we need to do to make you happy.  Would you like to start forwarding your calls directly to my phone so that I can take messages and tell people that you're in meetings too?  *smiles and winks*

I'll call tomorrow in the morning to afternoon time frame, but wait you don't sleep so I'll call you early then.

      I awoke today from a weird dream and I would like to share it with you, my blogmates:  My mom and I and our dog Bob were taking a walk after a family function of some sort.  the dream took place in the house and corresponding neighborhood of my youth. We were just walking along when I looked up and saw a huge albino Giraffe watching us and another off in the distance.  The albino Giraffe was apparently pissy and charged us nearly hitting me were it not for my mom pushing me out of the way.  I turned and watched as my mom went flying into someone's yard and then screamed as the other giraffe took out Bob-dog.  The angry Giraffes disappeared (obviously their thirst for blood had been fulfilled) and I started to look for my mom.  I kept looking at the bases of trees and finding really weird shit, like one tree that had a dozen rotweilers sleeping, tangled up in one another. So I was crying like a little girl (or The Rock, if you prefer ;) and started to walk home when I realized that I couldn't find her.  My dad met me half way and said that they had found her and I needed to come home.  There was a large tree in our front yard and my mom and bob-dog were laying there at the base of it.  My mom looked like a cancer patient, and bob...well bob just looked like he was sleeping. I remember all of my family standing around them, and they we're all just staring at me as if they couldn't possibly believe my albino Giraffe story...  Albino Giraffes??  WTF mate?

There are people moving in above me...They are so loud...Hopefully it is just the moving in process, but if it isn't I will send John up there and have him pour beer on them.

Well I really have nothing else to say...I'm just here watching  The Greatest Show on Earth  which for those of you who haven't seen it...its like a behind the scences drama of the circus featuring Jimmy Stewart as a clown with a rocky past...I love it. When I was little, besides being a chimney sweep...I wanted to be an elephant rider...and wear all the fancy costumes and such...the movie's Elephant rider lady is a sexy redhead named Angel...i still want to be her...alas...dreams thrown to the wayside...  &nbsp;

      Last night I had a dream that Tony Danza and I were in a dance competition. Not with each other, but against each other. Oh that Tony Danza, he thinks he's so smart with his "A-O O-A", but that didn't save him last night. He was wearing a pair of rainbow leg warmers, and I was in a tuxedo t-shirt. I don't remember who won, but later we were in the Dukes of Hazard car jumping over Boss Hog. Since he was driving I can only assume that he must have won. That really does make the most sense, because I can't dance that well...Except for slow dancing because you just move in a little circle.

I've been having weird dreams latley...so I thought I should share them with you all, for either interpretation or just even for shits and giggles... My dream started out in a diner in the sky- it was suspened in air- it was one of those cheezy 50's diners. I was there with the entire cast from Kids in the Hall.&nbsp; For some reason we all got in this big pie fight...there were meringues and there were cream pies...we were all just throwing them all at each other with a scary lady with a beehive yelling at us because she just mopped the floors. Everything was covered in whipped cream. After the giggling subsided we took the whipped cream from the mess and formed clouds that we threw out of the diner window...yes...that's right...we created clouds.  Do you think that could be what clouds are made of? Whipped cream??? I don't know but it was a really strange dream.

      Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:   1. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.   2. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   3. The United States should get out of the United Nations; our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.   4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.   5. Jesus loves you and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.   6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   7. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   8. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our longtime allies ("that's old Europe") then expect their cooperation and money.   9. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   10. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   11. A President lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A President lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.   12. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.   13. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business, nor are Dick Cheney's task force discussions with energy industry our business either.    14. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.   15. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the 1980s is irrelevant.

      First, George W Bush is a complete idiot.  He stole the election through congress and should NEVER have been put in any form of leadership.     Second, the rationale for Harry S Truman to drop the bombs in Japan was that WW II was coming to an end.  Germany had surrendered and more lives had been lost in that war than in any war previous. The battle with Japan was going to be a ground war, storming the beaches of Japan, and the Japanese were not going to give up.  Knowing this Harry S Truman decided not to risk American lives.  After two separate bombings still the Japanese did not want to surrender.  Can you imagine fighting someone like that? With the war at an end, and the American people starting to become anti-war, he made a decision.  This in no way reflex's the way George W Bush has made decisions.  The war he started is not over freedom or people's liberation (which they would like to justify it as), but instead over a family vendetta and money for oil.  Iraq is not even responsible for the terrorist attacks it's Saudi fucking Arabia.  This information was released by Richard Clark the counter terrorism guru for the last 4 presidents. I mean if you're going to start a war and kill some dudes shouldn't you at least make sure you kill the right ones?    But I like eggs too and as long as I can sit back, eat some eggs, and bitch from the sidelines I guess I'm ok for now.

      That article is silly.&nbsp; He tries to make the organization sound like a mafia family.&nbsp; Of course there is something wrong with someone who wants to be president.&nbsp; Normal people don't wake up one day and decide they want to run the country.&nbsp; You can question anyone's behavior and make seemingly innocent things sound bad.&nbsp; I don't really care who the next president is anyway.&nbsp; I'm still going to have a job, I'm still going to school, and I'm still going to eat eggs.&nbsp; If a president wants to go half way around the world a kill some dune coons then go ahead and do it.&nbsp; I'm not killing them and I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.&nbsp; That opinion is subject to change however if I get my arms and legs blown off by a terrorist bombing but until then, if killing dune coons makes the president happy, then more power to him.&nbsp; We have enough markets and 711s over here anyway.&nbsp; I wonder why I am the only one that thinks Harry S Truman is the worst president ever.&nbsp; How many hundreds of thousands of people did he murder?&nbsp; How many generations of deformed children and how many died a horrible death from the radiation of bombs he decided to drop?&nbsp; The main target was innocent civilians.&nbsp; If that happened nowdays, he would be in prison for war crimes.&nbsp; Compare that to George and he doesn't look all that bad.&nbsp; That's my opinion, I may be wrong, but probably not.

I got hit on by a butch girl that I went to high school with and a weird guy who wanted to "be naughty" with me and Steph.&nbsp; So needless to say we both got quite sassy. It was weird there though because they all knew each other. It was like they were all friends there except for us...which i was cool with, because they were some pretty rough looking people.&nbsp; But I do have a nice buzz going on now and its a shame to be home so early, but I do have to be at the shop tomorrow so perhaps I should go to bed. You guys don't know what you missed.... &nbsp; who am I kidding, you didn't miss anything...

      Thank you for the offer, but I think I will stay at home and not get hit on rather than go out and not get hit on. But make sure Steph gets loud and sassy for her 21st.

      My friend Steph turns 21 at tonite, and since no one is up to going out with her at midnight...it looks like its up to me.&nbsp; I think we are headed to the dreaded whetherbee's too look for some John Goodman replica dykes to buy us beers. I swear if I'm the only girl not asked to dance I will cry right into my pitcher of Natural Light.&nbsp; But if any of you are up to drinking some beers in a lesbian bar tonite , you know where to find me. I think I'm might give Rori a call and make her come with us.  It should be a good time had by all.... &nbsp;

      Alas, Colette has left us and already I am sad.  Colette baby, I know you're completely happy now, but this one's for you...::runs out and dumps a 40 oz. of O.E., and then waits patiently for John to read this and run over to suck it up with a straw::  And yes Chris, it has come to my attention that I am indeed the new Messiah.  However, I have often heard my best friend (and new apostle) Sarah say that you make the baby Jesus cry... Maybe what that really means is that Sarah was pophetising that you make me cry... Meaning you will be my Judas... So you're going to kill me, is that it?  You think you're cool or something, killing off the new messiah?  How could you Chris?  I hate you hate you hate you!  Um...Maybe we shouldn't have such an emotional messiah?

      Friends, Family...We are gathered here today to morn the loss of Ms. Rori Elizabeth Peters.  Sadly she has passed away leaving all of her earthly troubles behind her. We may all rest better knowing that she is in a better place...She is survived by her long time friend and close companion...her Cell Phone.    At the present moment the police have her cell phone in custody believing that The Cell Phone might have been involved in some "foul play" concerning the death of Ms Peters.  Knowing that tempers were high the cell phone was quoted as saying "but, she never answered me. I was feeling neglected."  There is rumored to be a court case pending, but the following police procedure has been kept very hush-hush.

      I don't think Axl Rose is hot.  Nor, do I think that Kid Rock has any sex appeal. Lisa and I were debating whether musical skills alone could make a guy fuckable.  Lisa said any guy in a band is automatically a tag, I however, disagree.  There are plenty of musicians who aren't hot... I mean come on, if you think about it, Michael Bolton is a musician and I'm pretty sure he's not hot. Even Rockstars aren't always hot... What about the lead singer of Gwar?  Would you run out and fuck him??? No!  ...Maybe they have nice personalities... Because that's how people should be truly judged...um yeah... I'm really just typing to type right now... Ah...

      I think it would be obvious that sarah's sister Emily should be the one to sex Josh up in the event of sarah's untimely west-nile death.  I mean, Emily looks more like Sarah than I do.  Alright then, it's settled, when sarah dies I do the cooking and emily will do the sexing.  And Chris, how dare you edit my words!  Quit being the man, damnit! Maybe I was trying to make a statement by blacking out the entire blog.  I swear, my point is lost on you people.  GOOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!!!!!!!!  There...I feel better *smiles*

      First off...Sorry Rori, I had to adjust your title. It was messing up the format and while I would never change the content on anyone's blog, I did have to shorten your GOAL.  Since it was only one word it extended the blog to the right and didn't allow for any future posts to be seen.   On the next order of business, I would have thought you of all people would have known that I would have a smart ass comment to make.  I mean that just me.  And Sarah...I will do my best to keep Rori from "knocking Da Boots" with your husband after your death.

      You both are pervs...Rori, I wouldn't ask you to have sex with my soon to be husband after I die anymore than I would call you to let you know that I pooped today. Perhaps I should have made myself more clear...::clears throat:: If I was dying, for arguments sake, let's say of, oh....i don't know...the west nile virus. I would ask you, Rori, being one of my dearest friends to take care of Josh, not in the sexing him up kind of way....but in the usual sisterly nice sort of way. I know that you too are not really all that chummy as of now, but I hope, that in my death you two would be closer...Here again...not in the perv way, but in the platonic way. I should hope that if I die, you're first insticnt would not be of hopping in to bed with Josh, but more like making him a casserole, which is what good southern girls are supposed to do. I was in hope, in my former blog, making a joke, of killing him or "taking care of him"...which I see now was one of my greatest errors. It was apparently far to vague. Now that I've cleared this up...I also must stress... that if I were to die, please don't kill Josh justifing yourself through this blog thinking it was one of my last wishes...I do not wish him dead anymore that I wish for you to have sex with him.  I do apologize for the confusion, Sincerly and with Deepest Respects, Sarah

      Is that a guy thing?  Sarah and I have been friends for about 8 years now and I am relatively sure that I've never found it fitting to call her and discuss my bowel movements.  I am also sure that she and I have never farted on each other.  Sarah, are we missing something here?  Is there a level of our friendship that we're missing out on because we don't share that part of our lives with one another?    Maybe we should keep a diary of our bodily functions and share them openly with one another, and then we can post our thoughts here on the blog for the world to enjoy. We could start a business making diaries specifically for making feces or gas reports.  We'll make them unisex, because I know the boys would enjoy it too.  Wow, Chris I just want to say thank you for opening my eyes to this wonderful world which I had never allowed myself to truly understand.    That's it... Sarah, I'm off to the bathroom and I'm going to call your phone and leave you a voicemail all about it.  BFF! LYLAS!

      So, I just pooped.  I will now be light and nimble so I won't get hit at Gung Fu. Maybe even more agile.  Plus, if I do get hit I know I won't get the shit knocked out of me, because if there nothing left in me then no reason to have it knocked out of me...Right, Right.  Happy to share.

      Ya, I thought it was in a " none-ya-business " sort of way also. So you're not the only purvey one.   But then after that, my next thought was "take care of him" means "Silent Death" you know...So he would have to be with you in the afterlife (or something).  Hmmmmmm, an eternity with Sarah...Covered in mosquito bites...Complaining about how much they itched.  Then as Josh patiently explains that they are both dead and she can't really feel them itch anymore. You know, because there flesh had rotted off them a while ago.  Oh well, I'm off to Gung Fu.

      when I first read sarah's post, I thought you meant that I had to take care of Josh in that "none-ya-business" kinda way.  I was about to dry-heave when the next sentence made me feel like a pervert for even thinking that.  I mean, not that Josh is disgusting or anything... If he was anyone else I wouldn't dry heave, but you know...He's Josh... I can't take all this pressure, I'm going to crack!  I don't want to take care of Josh when you die!

      I counted them up Rori...29.....29 mosquito bites that have all subsequently given me the west nile virus. I now have 29 strands of that virus of which is now pulsing through my veins and making me very uncomfortable in the process...yeah 4th! Which means...i'm dying. I know its a sad but true story. You all may divide up my things...Except for my hoodies, of which will be buried with me for scentimental reasons. Rori, I'm expecting you to take care of Josh after I'm gone. Not like, kill him, no don't do that, just make sure he has enough hot pockets in the freezer to last him awhile.  Goodbye Cruel World...wait i'm not dead yet, shit, i have to go to work today...Crap! I don't want to go to work today...but do I ever really wake up and say, "Hooray! Another day at ADT!" no I don't. but at any rate I better go get ready for the itchy hell i'm about to encounter.  Hello Chris and John! Hope you are having good days!

      The people below me have been thundering bass all morning.  My cat will not stop scratching at my door, and if I let her in she just scratches to get out. My roommates son is playing playstation full blast and my roommates are blaring the TV.   I'm going to hunt down the motherfuckers and drive them to an abandoned warehouse.  Then I'm going to hire some thugs who will be stationed at all hours to simply stand and keep these fuckers awake... I will make them all stay awake until they go crazy and their bodies eventually shut down and they die... Every one of them...  I hate the world...

      So, Rori and I go out to St Joe to go see some fireworks and after that we were on the way to go see Arron and Mongo out in Dearburn, but we got stuck in traffic (that lasted 2 hrs). We drank a little, but mostly we had water which by the time we hit our first gas station one of us was in a state of discomfort. So kudos to Rori for making it to the worst bathroom in Missouri...hip hip hooray.  Plus, I did have a really good time watching the fireworks.  So to recap...beer, fireworks, no Arron or Mongo, Traffic, bladder pains, home.  Hope everyone had a good 4th

      So I went up to Sebas' Dad's house, fished, drank a few beers, then I came home.  Got home around (:#), or without using caps, that would be 9:30.  I sat outside the apartment and drank beer, then I drank beer, then after that, I drank beer all the while watching kick ass fireworks.  So, to sum up my 4th in one sentence...fish, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer beer, beer, beer, fireworks, beer, beer, beer, and beer.

      Tonight at work, Rori and I made plans for her 'boxing'.  Friday night at Aaron's, we're going to slip her some ruffies.  When she passes out, The Rock will have his way with her.  When he is done, I'm going to cut off her arms and legs and put her in a box.  While Stovetop and I are gone, we're going to put her in front of the TV and turn on a Barney DVD on repeat for the entire time.  Rori will be my baby.  I will put her in a bonnet and I will feed her from a bottle.  It will be Hilary's breast milk, naturally.  I will also feed her Gerber baby food, and coo at her while I pinch her cheeks.  Rori has specifically requested banana flavor and carrots.  In case she spits up some Gerber, I will put a bib on her.  A bib with bunnies on it with little floppy ears.  Floppy ears, Floppy ears.  Stovetop will be in charge of diaper changing.  To prevent her from rolling out of her box and trying to get help while we are gone, she will be wearing an electric shock dog collar.  Everytime she tries to leave her box...BZZZZZ!!!!  All phones will be kept high enough so that she cannot reach them in her rolling attempts if the collar doesn't work.  When it comes time, we will enter her in the Special Olympics in the 'Legless & Armless Rolling Competition".  We have much training ahead of us.  First we will begin with Rori rolling laps around the living room.  She will go around the couch and the coffee table.  When she reaches an acceptable time, she will be allowed to roll in circles on the patio.  We can create a figure 8 roll for her around the palm trees.  Aside from being my baby, she will also serve as entertainment at parties.  If the party is over at Aaron's, we can put her in the pee corner....enough said.  We can roll her down the hill and watch her bounce as she falls off the railroad tie landscaping.  We will have to put reflective tape on her in case she rolls out into the street.  We don't want any cars hitting her.  I owe my inspiration to a whole package of Fundip and a bottle of Pepsi (and 4 Natural Lights).

      My only guess is that the people living upstairs must be training for the Olympics. And that being said, they better win the fucking gold medal, because for that much noise I feel like they own something to the country.

      Boo....new neighbors upstairs. Either this guy is the fattest guy in the world or he has a trampoline in all rooms of his apartment. This is not going to work. I should be sleeping right now, instead, I'm listening to bigfoot. I was thinking I could fire a couple bullets through the floor and maybe he would get the picture but that poses two problems. One, I don't have a gun, and two, I ain't got no motherfuckin' bullets. Where is Tony Soprano when you need him? He would go slap this guys sorry ass around and he would be tip-toeing from now on.  What is this guy's deal?  Is he running laps around his apartment?  Why doesn't he just sit his fat ass in front of the TV?  Stop fucking jogging around up there you motherfucker!!!!!!!!  This is really going to piss me off.  I saw the car that was parked next to me yesterday and there were no broken windows. That leaves me with a question. That question would be "WHAT THE FUCK?" I must leave now to go poop. Poopy, poopy poop, I love to poop.

      That is a good question.  Years from now when we all look at the archives of the blog we will say..."When did John join the blog?" and of course since he posts and deletes the answer will elude mankind for centuries...Unless we ask him...Or have him write it down on a post-it note and stick it to my door.  But still a good question.  Sarah, tell your sister that she's HOT. Thanks.
