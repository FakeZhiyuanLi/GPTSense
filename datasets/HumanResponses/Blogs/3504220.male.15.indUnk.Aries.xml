      Superman (It's Not Easy) I can’t stand to fly I’m not that naive I’m just out to find The better part of me   I’m more than a bird…I’m more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train It’s not easy to be me   Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I’ll never see   It may sound absurd…but don’t be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed…but won’t you concede Even Heroes have the right to dream It’s not easy to be me   Up, up and away…away from me It’s all right…You can all sleep sound tonight I’m not crazy…or anything…   I can’t stand to fly I’m not that naive Men weren’t meant to ride With clouds between their knees   I’m only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me   It’s not easy to be me.

      100 Years I'm 15 for a moment Caught in between 10 and 20 And I'm just dreaming Counting the ways to where you are   I'm 22 for a moment She feels better than ever And we're on fire Making our way back from Mars   15… there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose 15…there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live…   I'm 33 for a moment Still the man but you see I'm a they A kid on the way A family on my mind   I'm 45 for a moment The sea is high And I'm heading into a crisis Chasing the years of my life   15… there's still time for you Time to buy and time to lose yourself Within a morning star   15… I'm all right with you 15… there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live…   Half time goes by Suddenly you’re wise Another blink of an eye 67 is gone The sun is getting high We're moving on...   I'm 99 for a moment Dying for just another moment And I'm just dreaming      Counting the ways to where you are   15… there's still time for you 22… I feel her too 33… you’re on your way Every Day's a new Day   15… there's still time for you Time to buy and time to choose Hey 15… there's never a wish better than this When you only got 100 years to live

      Why is everything so fulled up wif problems. So many problems. Feel like pulling all my hair out ya know.. Ppl keep on giving themselves stupid problems. N they ask me 4 advice.. Sure i like helping ma frenz but dun ask me questions that i cant answer.. Its so stupid, messed up.. N also the problems they have are meaningless.. Like 4 example, this gal dun like me.. Man c'mon.. thats warped.. am i the gal?.. how the heck am i supposed to answered?? Freak man.. As much as i like helping ppl dun bog me wif unsolvable problems?

      People have problems. That is inevitable. But wat bothers me is the fact that most people let the problems consume them. Degrading themselves to a point of total destruction never allowing them to recover. Also, problems can change a person so dramatically that i cant even recongize that person. I can never help a person because the person ask me 4 help. That person has to do some of the helping to. Why do ppl keep the problems wif them? Never changing, never solving. Change too comes after problems. Y muz change happen? I have seen change so drastic that that person no longer exist. Is change evolution? If it is then i definitely dun want it to happen. So ppl let go of ya problems. They only destory bits and pieces of u.

      Yes, i know she chose me but still i cant help feeling insecure wif him buzzing around confessing his love and all. I mean c'mon she rejected ya so get a life. dammit. He's been giving me advice on how to hook a gal. I would listen if not 4 the fact the his steads hardly last weeks. And 4 the record his shortest one was only a day. No offense to ya gal. Perhaps its wrong 4 me to say but some of his idea are good yet most of them are warped. Fr example, he told me to send her sweets messages everyday, i agree its necessary but for goodness sake, i'll sure she wants her own life right? Please.. I remember the day, where i was so angry i wanna kill him and if not 4 her i probably would have. Thanks.. haha or else a would have been put on trial 4 murder. But seriously, she have been telling me thats he is bothering her wif this constant reminders and love confessions plus alot of other shit. Anyway, i'm seriously losing ma patience wif him. And one fine day, something would happen. Hopefully it wont happen.

      Lets see, woke up at 7.30am. Made my way to school, finished of some of our sanding on the bike. Then went to Lot 1 Mac to meet CI Asri 4 some meeting. Then after the meeting. Aqilah, Renkai, Kangsheng, Huilin n Me. Met Foo Chang After that we walked around the shopping complex 4 while before deciding to go to Lim Bang. After playing CS 4 abt an hour, headed back to Lot 1, to Mac again, sit down chit-chat. Then Foo Chang decided to watch movie and he had a hard time convincing me to watch, so after we went to the cinema to check the timings but there was no time. So Foo Chang suggested that we travel to West Mall to watch the movie. So we took a train there and brought tickets 4 the 7.05pm show. "Riddick". Then we eat dinner. Pizza Hut actually. Yum! Soon it was time to watch the movie. Wat a fantastic show, filled with CGI effects. Power sia. I recommand anyone who enjoys Science Faction to catch the show. It would simply blow ya mind. After that i went home. A perfect day. I like working like that. Left the house at 8.00am, reached home at 9.30pm. Best!

      The next day woke up at 6.45. Did our u know wat stuff.. Proceeded wif breakfast and unpitch our tents. The next activity was abs sailing.. It was basically repelling down a wall juz more basic. I waited and waited and waited till it was my turn.. I got into probably the most uncomfortable thing i've have worn and went to the site. Readied myself and got underway. i decided to be adventourous and instead of walking down decided to jump down. And in the process of the jump i caught myself in a knot. Da instructor had to come up and help me untie it. He told me later that i gt stuck coz the equipment wasn't made 4 jumping hahah, guess i was a little advanced. Anyway, after that event we were ready the leave the campsite. So once again, time to life up those heavy packs. And to my surprise we had to carry out our garbage. Crap. Anyway, i had no intention to carry one of those, then group 6, zana volunteered to carry it but i relised that Zana couldn't even carry her own pack without falling out, i helped eased her burden. So we started our trek back now the track. Mine was da last group to go. WE continued till the bridge and i dumped the garbage bag into a pit. Bye bye, Continued our way back to da bus, sang songs along the way. No exactly fun but helped us hold on to da jouney. Soon, we reached our destination, i wanted to knee down and shout out loud. Lucky i didn't.. Dumped our gear into da bus and headed to our resort. Or if ya saw it, more like a 3star hotel. Lame, Watever better than sleeping in the tents. My room was 409. My roomates, Jereld and Arun, Did our watever stuff and assembled at the lobby at 7. Dinner and then the shopping mall. Brought cup noddles and coffee to drink and also brought something else 4 someone else. Hahaha!.. When back to da hotel. Watched soccer till 2am, when to sleep after packing our stuff. Woke up at 6.45 the next day. Had breakfast and then on the way back singapore. 8hours later we reached there. Thats the whole trip.. Sayonara

      Hi! last ya heard frm me was 4days ago right.. Yep.. Back frm malaysia and heck i enjoyed myself.. Fun sia. Right lets start frm da beginning. 1st nite.. nothing special.. spent 8hours in the bus.. 1st few hourz we chit-chat and joked around. Around 1am. We started getting sleepy and soon most of us soon fell asleep. As 4 myself. 4 some crap reason i didn't even sleep 4 even 1hr.. sad.. So the next day.. At around 6.30. we reached our destination. which was at some desolated place in malaysia or to be exact at kuantan. We hiked a stagering 5km on the hot asphalt. Nearly draining the life outta us. Carrying a large backpack combined wif plently of plastic bags which added to da load plus one tent and a sack of food! ouch!... haha but we managed to complete it wif plenty of will power and of course motivation. We reached da campsite at abt 10.30am and were given the task of pitching out tent and cooking our dinner. At 12 we were supposed to finish. At 12. we were told to prepare ourselves 4 da best part of da trip and the reason y we came. And that was da waterfalls. So we changed into our swimming gear and went along our way. But wat we did't expect was a 25storey or more climb to da top. Which took us nearly 3hours. Tok abt tough. Wif ravines and stream plus a whole lot of ups and downs and hardly enough water,u can say it was amazing that we managed to complete it. Anyway.. when we reached the sumit. the view was fantastic. The huge waterfall and the spectacular lake. So we took a grp photo and were given 30mins of swimming.. Wow! when i entered the water it was so cool and refreshing. Good stuff. The water could even be drank from the source itself. It was that clean. So after the dip it was time to return back, another 3hours trek back left us nearly dead but once again wif lots of perseverance and encouragment we made it back to campsite. Bath and dinner followed. Bath was very interesting coz we got to bath in a natural area and of course a rare opportunity to bath wif gals.. Erm! Erm! Cough! Cough!. Hahaha. Dinner was normal.. some of us had to eat wif the use of a torchlight. We had a mini campfire. Day 1

      Yea! lets see how my day went.. First of all i woke up late, hmmm not exactly late but close to it.. I woke up at 8.30.. Yah i know thats early but guess wat i have to reach school by 9am..? What the heck, rushed like mad sia.. Hahah no lah, i juz took ma time and strolled to school happily. Anyway, i practically spent abt 20mins sitting down in the NP room before i had to go somewhere else 4 some business which all of u know that is to extend my passport. So anyway, i travelled wif the ppl going 4 some shooting compeition. Who are the lucky guys? Well, there was Shawn Loo, Shawn liew, Sutris, Lynn and Siti.. No not Zana but one of the other NCOs which i dun think many would know.. That too bad.. Anyway, they alighted at Toa payoh. But it wasn't my stop yet, so i continued my jouney, in case ya dun know where i'm headed that would be the SIR building in Lavender... If u remember, i went there yesterday and had to return cz of some problems. So everything proceeded perfectly till i got to see the officer, who examined my passport. This time i had my declaration letter, but it turned that my letter wasn't good enough, y? coz i forgot to sign another portion of the letter.. Wahahah!! i tell u man, i nearly freaked out at the thought of having to come back another day and u all know how far the place is.. But lucky the lady symathised wif me and let me extend my passprt, Thanks lady.. So once again, time to return home but before that my frenz decided to make an appointment wif me.. n to tell ya the truth i was in no mood to go home anyway, S happily i was underway to CCK.. Anyway. Ok, what really burn me up, was that when i reached CCK, i could not locate my frenz, and wats worst i soon found out that they were not even in Lot 1 at that time. Also when i tried to contact them, i was met wif blank calls.. Wah! i tell u.. i was burning wif anger, nt that they were not there but the fact that they had ample time to inform me. Wif that feeling, i practically stomped out of Lot 1. When i took the MRT back and reached my station, by some luck my frenz called me to apologize and those who noe me, i always forgive and forget. So, wif me calmed down, i went back to Lot 1 and met them. Of course when i met them i tried not to show that i was angry so i resumed my good mood, it eventually became good anyway. We had lunch.. A big lunch if i might add. But since i was already tired.. i was then ready to return home.. Peace Man!

Anyway, before i went out Foo chang called me a asked if a could accompany me it was fine with me coz veri bored ar.. go alone sian. Anyway when i reached the building the ppl told me that i couldn't extend coz i was underage... wat the hell? underage?? i sign most of my documents myself.. ah.. wat is the freaking prob? So after leaving the buliding in a hurry, i decided to have an eating frenzy.. I makan wan ton mee, ice kanchang and had a glass of sugar cane. So shoik!! Wahh!! dreaming of food liao.. So then foo chang n me went to a furniture store to browse around obviously didn't but anything. After taking a train back to bukit batok, decided to stop by.. Went to da arcade to shoot some dinosaurs.. So fun.. but soon i mati.. Then gt airplane game.. Hahaha also die very fast. On the way, i had a cup of streamed corn.. so creamy.. Fun sia.. Then finally took a bus home and near the bus stop i saw a ice cream cart.. I couldn't resist and bought a chocolate ice cream.. As u noe my fave food is ice cream.. Yum!.. Then it was back home 4 me.. ZZZZZ!!

      How do u become a good NCO, some frenz ask me. Frankly saying i have no idea. Perhaps its the actions of one or even the words. But who knows wat time one a good leader. For my case, my motto is "Lead by example". But thats my motto. What it basically means is that if u expect a certain standard from yr cadets its obvious that u muz do 2 times better. Rank should also nvr be used 4 intimdation purposes. I find it a shame to use one's rank to scare someone instead of using yourself as a person to do the exact same thing. Also, rank does not determind the kind of leader someone is. Action are much more important. Do not ever bootlick the shoes of yr officers coz u will lose the respect of yr fellow squadmates and of course yr reputation. Also methods used by a NCO may seem harsh but look again and see if the actions are juztified. A good way to become a good leader is to do wat u think is right. Never let yr cadets intimdate u or control u. U are the leader not them. On final notes, always always show care and concern 4 yr cadets.   P.S this memo is juz my way of becoming a good leader, it may not be correct.     Some advice here is quoted by ppl who gave me advice

      First of all..  Congrats to all who passed their corporal test and the staff sergeant test. 4 those who failed i'm sorry but try harder next time ok.. And da corporals.. ya guys muz be veri happy but remember that u guys still got a long way to go and corporal is only a stepping stone 4 u guys. Always remember that the higher yr rank the more responsibilty u gt and the more expectation the officer and instructors have from each and evryone of u. Dun ever use rank to intimidate yr cadets. But use rank as a sign of abilty and quailty of each of evryone of ya. For those who aim for great things remeber that being proud is good but nvr be too proud coz should u fall in battle. The impact would be painful and heavy. So guys and gals enjoy yr rank but remember of consqeuences.   RESPECT NOT THE RANK BUT RESPECT THE PERSON HOLDING THE RANK. DO NOT BE HATED BUT BE RESPECTED.

      Imagine a world without love, imagine a world without commpassion, imagine a world where feelings don't exist. Would life be worth living then?. What if we are all born without the feeling of being loved. How sad our lives would be. But thankfully, we are all born with emotions and feelings. And we live each day with the feeling of being loved and feeling of loving someone. However love and feelings are fagile things and once destoryed is very diffcult to mend and once destoryed might sometimes never be mended again. So treasure love. Even a person with a heart of stone maybe turned even with a little of love. And the love for someone is divine and special and that person should be loved with wholeheartly, and treasured forever. Take special care never to hurt that person or we might regret it.

Iza asked me something which i was quite shocked abt. Dun bother finding out. So anyway, day was pretty normal. The school ended as normal. Boring. After school it was time to go to dunearn 4 ma CLB classes. Took a bus there, finished my lesson at around 4. Then took 187 with Lynn to woodlands, causeway point. 30mins bus ride. When i reached there. Went to Jack's place to meet up with Foo Chang, Weida, Shirong, Shanhe, Asri,&nbsp;Tian Ci, Chee siong and of course Kangsheng. Lynn did join in coz she thought she was an extra. Haiz. We are 1 happy family. Hmmm.. had a major dinner man. So full. Hahah, after that we all walked around the place to clam our heavy stomaches.

      Haha! Wats up everyone. Woke up today early to catch her on stage. Came to school at around 7.20am. Kinda early 4 me. Assembled at the hall. Looked around 4 her but couldn't find her. Imagine my surprise when i saw her on stage. Couldn't stop smiling. Lol. Anyway, the day was pretty ok. Chit chat with friends and such. So after school. Went looking 4 her. Found her and we chit chat 4 awhile. But she had to go coz she had something on.. I too had something to do. But i promised to send her home after she came back at 4.45pm. Anyway, i went to the NPCC HQ to assist the Sec1s collect uniform. I went there with Mdm. Rose, kangsheng, Huilin and Norishan. Anyway, when there.. finished around 3.50pm. I waited around in the NP room with Kangsheng n Huilin. Dicussed abt some happening in the unit. Anyway, at 5pm i decided it was time to go look 4 her. Hahah, found her juz outside the NP notice board. N 4 some reason she seemed very happy.. :P. Anyway, i send her home with again another nice memory. Cannot disclose ah.. Later kana hudum! hehe.. So after that i went home. Met Foo chang 4 dinner where we had another chit chat session. Found out things.. So after that, i went home and basically slacked away.. Hahah.. Chio!

      How ya all? Its been awhile eh? Haiz.. Let me tell ya abt friday. After school, i went to the NPCC room. Check out a few stuff. Anyway, Huilin, Kangsheng and Shiqi was there already. Apparently, looking 4 me.. Seems that they had some news to confine in me.&nbsp; Bad news though.. But i wont go through it. So at around 2.30pm. Took a bus to the CID building in Outram park. Had a very gross time here. Very disturbing pictures.. Haiz.. Couldn't have lunch.. Haha. So at 5pm, the sec3 left the buliding and headed back to school. No time to go home to change into home clothes. Crap! Anyway, rushed back to school, barely had time to eat something then took a bus to BPGHS. We all got settled n then the campfire staretd.. Fantastic pryo works. So the night proceeds with alot of fun.. Singing, jumping lots of fun.. Hahah outta breath. Anyway, it was a memorable night 4 reason i won't disclose but that someone will know wat i'm toking abt.&nbsp; Anyway, after sending my GF home, i had to rush to get a train home. Haiz.. i wasn't making ya worried or anything but dun worry abt me. When to sleep at around 1am. Busy!  &nbsp; Next day, saturday NP time. Haiz.. Woke up around 8am. Changed this travelled to School. But 4 some raeson i came in 15mins late. So cadets i cant be a good role model 4 arriving early.. haha like they say no sense of urgency.. haha anyway, changed in my full-u which to tell ya the truth i dun really like it.. So heavy.. haha u see, i action already.. So, ask them to fall in at the 3rd storey where the NCOs checked their uniform. So the G.O.H got into position n i was the BC (block commander)&nbsp;. Wah i tell u bloody nervous sia! I kept on kana scolded but i guess i needed it coz i found out that i wasn't so good at a few thing. I wowed to make it the best contingent teck whye has seen. But i muz have patience..wakaka.. anyway, after the rehearsal. Time 4 a major chit chat session. Seems like everyone has issues n hopefully through such a talk can resolve the matter making us into a gold unit. So the cadets had there talk n the NCOs had theirs. AFC was pretty angry but he got us all motivated. Anyway, after np kangsheng n me went to lot 1 to meet my GF n friends.. We all makan at Mac. After that we all tired liao.. Go home.&nbsp; I went home bathe, then laze around 4 awhile then went online. Chat till 10pm. Then went to sleep coz got a bad headache. Hahaha..

      U know, sometimes when i go 4 NPCC on saturdays, I fear the things i have to do yet at the same time i also want to make a difference in the squad. I take pride in my squad yet at times i may go out of control. But is it really my fault? I cant seem to be able to get anything inside their heads. Am i doing something wrong? I think i'm doing ok. I pamper them when necessary but punish them when needed. Am i too harsh or perhaps am i too nice. I remember the time where the squad nominated me as the best NCO. But i sensed something amiss. Were they voting 4 me coz i'm too nice to them? So i tried another appoach. To be very harsh. N imagine my surprise when someone told me that my squad hated me. Then it hit me, they liked me coz i didn't punish them. But what logic is that? They like me 4 not scolding them.. I rather be respected 4 the right reasons rather then for the wrong reasons. I understand that its not their faults entirely, at times i may oversee certain things. But i do try to be careful in judging them. I have thought of throwing in the towel but i guess i cant. Coz if i do, then wat will happen to them? I dun want to lose hope yet i cant help feeling lost. Its even worst when the person i like is inside. I cant possibly be biased can i? As much as i want to, i cant. I really hope things will change 4 the better or i will have no choice but to adandon them altogether. I will always remain a friend to them but may never again as a leader of them. Any Sec2 reading this log, i hope u understand that there is a line between us. As a NCO to a Cadet. Hate me or not, i am still your NCO.   P.S: I'm not trying to gain sympathy, i am in no way making all you feel guilty, juz trying to get my point of view clear to all. The above is how i feel. Please leave comments if u want. Need not be nice. Be as harsh as possible. Thank you

      Well, hello my friends, we meet again. Its been awhile, where should we begin? Feels like forever. OKOK.. Lame! Anyway, its been days since i last updated.  Reason? Been very busy n of course got some problems wif the com. But it's probably repaired now. So lets talk abt last Saturday. Finally got my S/SGT rank and we started on the NDP training sessions. Instructor is CI Asri. We used batons as there wasn't any rifles or at least not yet. So we march here, march there. Drills damn rusty. So nayway, we finished at around 2pm. Went to lot 1 wif Iza, Syafiqah, Zana, Renkai and Kangsheng 4 lunch but something cropped up half-way and i was in a bad mood 4 the rest of the day. I found out later wat it was. Which i cant disclose to anyone. Confidential. When home n then spend practically the whole day doing nothing. The next day. Sunday, woke up pretty early. Watched cartoon then when out wif my mom to catch a movie. Spiderman 2. The show was fantastic n i recommend to show to anyone. After the show, when shopping to but some shirts n stuff. Nothing special. So we went home, surf the net, chat wif frenz n then packed my stuff 4 school. Went to sleep around 1am. Dunno doing wat also. Haiz.. Nite person. Next day, Monday, woke at 6.45am. Quite early 4 school. Slept during the principle's talk.. So the day progressed wifout anyway excitment. So after school, went to np room to prepare 4 the dog unit. The sec2 came n soon we were off. Go to the dog unit a perfect waste of time. Went there to see a video. Haiz.. lucky, i sec1 managed to see some dogs. So anyway, when back to school soon after n then dismissed the squad. When to lot 1 wif Iza, Zana, Izzah, Zaf and Kangsheng. Walked around lot 1 n then see Iza back to the bus stop. Didn't see her home though.. Oh well.. Anyway, thats the update 4 3 days. Chio!

      Well, i guess i need to update. Not coz i dun want but coz got some problems. Anyway, last sunday i went to our sunny island in the south. Sentosa!. I met my  urlLink friends  at 9am at Bukit Batok MRT. Foo chang, Weida, Shanhe, Fang Zhen, Renkai and Kangsheng. Took a train to Habourfront MRT station. Brought stuff to eat coz the stuff at Sentosa damn Expensive. Anyway, we rented a resort. Hahah.. shuld have seen da room. So small n u wonder how 7ppl gonna squeeze into one small room. So after checking in. We headed to da beach 4 some fun. Shanhe and Weida went off to see gals. We split and our group headed towards the east. There at a nice shady tree we shed our clothes n jumped headlog into the sea.. Brr!! So cold!.. Anyway, we splashed around in da  urlLink water . But soon it started to rain.. We met up wif da CIs and headed back to the resort. The rain stopped shortly but then it was  urlLink time  4 dinner. We headed to a resturant 4 a buffet dinner. 4 $14 we ate 4 over 2hrs. So full.. LOL the  urlLink food  very nice. Then we when to watch the  urlLink Water  show at the musical fountain. So nice. Heheh another good place to bring my GF.. Hahaha!! So after the fantastic show we took the monorail back. We stayed up practically the whole nite juz to watch  urlLink soccer . Then we went out at nite/morning around 5am in the morning, to do something. Wat it is it will remain private. So back we went. Had breakfast at burger king then headed to the beach again. We swam and played 4 hours till it was time to return back home. When i reached home.. I went to sleep. Woke up 14hrs later.. Thats all 4 now.. see ya

      Pretty normal day.. But a little emotional. Coz i had a good shout at my secret location.. Only 2people know it. Anyway, screamed my lungs out.. Wait.. more like a shout.. wahaha.. After that left school and had lunch at Macdonalds. Hahah, i guess somethings wrong wif me. My frenz tell me that i look different, older, aged even half-dead. Yah.. i'm very tired.. I dunno y.. Perhaps it life. Feel like disappearing 4 a few days.. Be a loner 4 a few days. Shout all i want, vent all my anger.. Hahah, nah i'm not a crazy guy.. But that how i relieve stress. Anyway, walked around lot1 awhile before going back home. Took a long nap.. Sometimes i juz wanna sleep forever.. Juz to get away frm life but i guess its not possible. Woke up 4hrs later, quite refreshed but only temporary.. Haiz! Now sitting down writing this log.. Hahaha anyway, a note.. No matter wat problems i have, it will dismiss the next day. So i'm back to normal almost instantly, so no worries. Unless u see me in a grave mood 4 day then smths wrong other then that dun worry abt it. Problems come, problems go.. I juz have the ability to forget it.. See ya some other time.. Sayonara!!

      Hahah! Helo everyone, its been awhile huh? Since u last heard from me was on thursday. When i went 4 my ATC camp in ubin. Well, let me start off on friday. We assembled at school at 12.30pm then took a bus to changi jetty. Had lunch there. A bowl of fish soup noodle. Then all the schools started coming, we were supposed to help West Spring with some logistic stuff. In other words, help carry the rations to ubin. Ouch my arms very pain.. Hahaha but 4 some strange reason it was fun, perhaps its coz we all worked as a team. Hmm anyway, took a dumboat to the island before walking abt 1.5km to the campsite. When reached the campsite assembled at the folyer. Then begin the camp lor, a few word, instructions. I was sorted into my group. Group 6. Foxtrot. 13 other team members. Nicolas, Sufiyan, Hong kai, Wanru, Ya see(Dunno how to spell) Sandy, Yuan Xi, Chen hoon, Winifred, Khat, Naqiyah and Rose who i didn't have a opportunity to know. Anyway, the day quite ok lor. Then sleep till nxt day. Aorund we all woke then so so lah till activities. Cycle activites. I games, Rafting, Obstacle course.  Very fun. Hahaha.. Damn tiring. So after that dinner then got campfire. Sing song.. Aiya standard stuff lar. Hmm then solo nite. I so sleepy struggling to stay awake. Hahaha my Bee Siang Mdm woke me up.. Hahaha then go 4 a proper sleep. Hmmm.. A full 6hours of sleep. Nice.. Sleep like pig.. Hahah. Nxt morning, woke up kinda  refreshed. Makan a huge breakfast then go pack up everything. Then got telematch.. Hahah very interesting, I paired up wif this 2 malay gals. Hmm wats thir names? Naqiyah and Kaht.. Hahah nice. Hmm all of us had fun then took a pic together. Wait 4 Foo chang to develop. Hahah.. Cool. Then we all got extra ration. Then we had to present our puzzle to everyone. Mine was the moral "The single greatest ingredient to sucess is the ability to get along well with people" When asked to explain i said " No matter how high your rank or post is, if u cant get along well wif people, u are nothing" n 4 that effort i got clapped the loudest.. Hahaha kinda cool. Then i was time to depart. We said our goodbyes then left ubin island. After that when home and slacked. Tml school. Chio everyone.
