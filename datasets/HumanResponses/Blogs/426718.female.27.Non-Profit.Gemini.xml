      IT’S CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAH!!!!!! Just came back from my celebrating Christmas Eve with my family.  And I’m exhausted ( yet here I am on the net .)  Actually I had to help my mom type up an email.  And of course I was a smart ass with the email.  hehe   Everyone needs a lil Jen of Kuo humor .  8) Just a couple months ago my mom has been taking computer classes.  She’s been learning how to do the basic like typing and using MS Word.  And now she finally has an email address and internet access.   Note to self…take off incriminating photos of oneself off net . =8O That’s not me Mom that’s my evil twin.  I have no idea who that gogodancer is.    We had  huo guo  for dinner.  Man, I love  satay  sauce. Got into major discussion with my uncle and cousin Derek about Asians and media.  We actually got pretty loud.  (Look what going to UCLA has turned me into.) ;p Afterwards my cousins wanted  to go to TGIFs to hang out but I was waaay too tired from going out to LA yesterday.  REALLY I AM.    Yesterday I had hung out with my high school buds Sharon and Luz, to catch up and exchange gifts.  Miss Saldarriaga drove.  Thanks for the “scenic tour” of OC.  ;p BTW any single, cute and heterosexual Columbian men out there?  Luz is on the PROWL. hehe   Got dessert at Hans' Homemade Ice Cream in Santa Ana.  Sampled their version of Pumpkin Pie and Lemon Custard because I want to compare it to  urlLink Fosselman’s . It’s okay but not as good as Fosselman’s. So I got their pistachio flavor ice cream instead.  That wasn’t too bad.  Then Sharon and Luz had the insane idea of going to  urlLink South Coast Plaza .  Good lawd was it packed.  For the heck of it they went to Burberry.  I can’t believe such stores like these sell ugly ass T-shirts for $95.  And what gets me is that there are stupid, pretentious people that are willingly to buy it.    We got sick of the crowds in South Coast Plaza really quickly and I suggested we go and bake some Christmas cookies at my house.  So we decided to bake some white chocolate chip cookies and some sugar cookies with butter cream frosting. Luz made the chocolate chip batch, Sharon made the sugar cookie one and I got to make the butter cream frosting ( YUMMY ).  Unfortunately, we didn’t buy any decorating tools so we had to improvise with plastic bags.  And man it wasn’t pretty.  There were porn and X-rated cookies. Think chocolate chip cookie people with white chocolate chip nipples and nuts.  (Look what we have done to something wholesome as Christmas cookies.  It’s Triple XXX-mas with us.  Yes, my close friends and I are pervs.  What can we say? 8D )   Luz made a bloody looking sugar cookie man and Sharon and I made some abstract and impressionistic  cookies.  Manet and Monet have nothing on us.  Shoot, who am I kidding our frosting colors got mixed up together and was turning into a brownish purple color. They were cookies on acid.  The three of us were also on a major sugar high.   Luz kept singing the same Christmas song over and over and over and over again.  While I was having WAY too much fun with the frosting.  I mixed up all the colors leftover and wanted to see what trippy colors and patterns would come out.  The frosting ended up looking like roundworms ( mmmmm, doesn’t that just sound so yummy ?)  We were having so much fun that we lost track of the time that we didn’t finish til 8ish and I was suppose to be in LA at 6ish for Jason Chu’s 27th birthday party.   Oops .   Started to head out to LA and was half way there and then found out that the rest of them were down to going to the Mayan.  I had only been joking around about actually going because my other group of friends Rena and Linh were going there to have a girl’s nite out and I didn’t know if I could hang out with them because it was Jason’s birthday.  So I headed back to Costa Messy got changed since I was in casual attire.  Richard was nice enough to wait for me to drive back up to LA.   I had been wanting to check out the Mayan since I was in OCC but never got the chance.  Rena had mentioned there were going to be CK models…male ones.  But I figure out later that this was the  urlLink Proofpositive  event.  So it was just ONE male model and the rest were those import Asian model types.  Oh well.    Meet up with the rest of the TACL people.    Saw Art from Pac Ties or should I say  urlLink DJ Anonymous  of Proofpositive.  8)  Also ran into Jay, Rickmond, Tim and Ben Ling. Small world.  But then it was an Asian party so you’re bound to run into people you know.  But it was good to see some other familiar faces I hadn’t seen for a while but I never could find Rena. 8( It was pretty packed and me being an idiot and with no SuperHoochie powers brought in her jacket with her and didn’t even see that there was a coat check.   DOH!    Just messed around on the dance floor, which BTW was very sticky, I kept getting fliers, napkins and straws stuck on my shoes.  Some of the guys oogled at the nearly naked gogodancers, which I admit had nice bodies though how much was that real or store bought is another story.  I found out later thru talking to Art that the Polaroids with the ONE CK male model was for free. DARN! See this is why I need to go to the clubs with all girls more. Actually to come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever been to a club once with only all girl friends.  Wait, I take that back I did once with my high school friends Kimi, Erin and Sharon at Cowboy Boogie and Metropolis (well when it still existed.)   Afterwards went to Rich and Pason’s aparto aka Taiwan Center 2 to get some grub.  Went on a Jack in the Box run.  And watched Meet the Parents.  I ended up crashing at their place because I was it was almost 5 and I too tired and sore to go home.  Got about 5 hours of asleep.  That’s why I’m tired people.  It sucks when most of your friends are up in LA now.  Me thinks it’s time to move back up to LA.    BTW got a Christmas card from Janet Kohara, my childhood best friend from first grade.  She’s living in LA and working in Santa Monica.  I can’t wait to meet up with her I haven’t seen her for ages.  8)

      Man, what a week.  Went to the Post Office in Santa Ana to mail out a package because Amazon took forever to send in my package.  And what does stupid Jen do. She accidently throws away her waiting number or whatever you call those.  So I have to wait even longer in line.   Ai-yo .    Then on Wednesday, I wrote freakin' 34 Christmas cards.  And no not your generic "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year" message, I wrote some personal Jen-of-Kuo-isms.  Though some of you, who were at the bottom end of the alphabet in my address book or gave me your snail mail address last minute, I pity you, Jen was getting tired because it was in the 3 o'clock in morning and I was losing my mind ( yes, even more so than normal ) and I just wrote some of the most random shit. Sorry.  But I'll be impressed if you can read my hieroglyphic handwriting.  Yeah yeah see what the net has done to me.  Bad internet bad.   Thursday morning then pops up and I have to wake up early to get to the press release in Santa Ana for the Asian on Asian hate crime that happen in Anaheim back in Oct. 20-21.  Pretty good turn out from the media.  Though I didn't see  urlLink KCBS  or  urlLink LA Times .  I expect better from LA Times since  urlLink OC Register  actually has been pretty decent in covering the story.  CBS sucks in my opinion because they got rid of Tritia Toyota.    I don't know how effective the sketch will be because it looks like your generic young Asian male. Hopefully, the police department won't use it to profile Asian youth because that's been in problem in OC for awhile. And it doesn't help that one of the cars was a white Honda Civic.    But I hope someone comes up and speaks up. Because if you have information about this and are holding back info.  You're accepting hate and another form of terrorism. The  urlLink Southern Poverty Law Center  has great reasons why we should combat hate.   urlLink "10 Ways To Fight Hate" .  SPLC says it best "  Do something. In the face of hatred, apathy will be interpreted as acceptance — by the haters, the public and, worse, the victim. Decency must be exercised, too. If it isn’t, hate invariably persists  ."  When Sundeep first told his story to us a few weeks ago I got the chance to sit right next to him.  This was when his mouth was still completely wired shut. It's so sad to know how violent people can be.  And can you believe this happen to him on his birthday?  And the security guard just stood by.  People who don't think hate crimes is an issue need to talk to victims of hate crimes. I'm sure you won't feel the same way afterwards.  Watch "Who Killed Vincent Chin" and tell me you don't feel for his mother who never got justice.  I admire Sundeep and his family though because it's very courageous for him to speak up because many hate crime victims don't speak up especially within the APIA community.  But I'm so glad he did.  His sister even went to the various organizations that came out and thank them for their support (like me). 8)  If you're interested in contacting Sundeep you can contact him at hatehurts911@hotmail.com   But if you're interested in helping out with the reward money we're still looking for people to help out.  Make checks out to  urlLink OCAPICA  (Orange County Asian & Pacific Islander Community Alliance.) Contact me or Jason Lacsamana at  urlLink jjlacs@ocapica.org  for more info.    And for any of those interested in checking out what the sketch looks likes  urlLink click here   This is only one of the suspects.    But onto a happier subject-FOOD. Afterwards, a bunch of OCAPICA and APALC people went to  urlLink Pat & Oscars  to eat and talk. And I can see why they put breadstick as their web addy cuz it's good.  I plan on trying their other yummy meals next time.

      It's 9 o'clock and I'm the only one at the  urlLink Taiwan Center .  So I'm goin abuse this fast internet access and download music. Woo hoo! Shirley Bassey you rock.  Hey, I grew up listening to James Bond theme songs.  It's Kuo family trip tradition.    But just came back from  urlLink Shakas , which is a Japanese Hawaiian restaurant in Monterey Park. Went to hang out with Amy and Vy from Pac Ties. Ordered the Shaka plate.  Dude, so much meat.  I couldn't finish the sesame chicken.  The macaroni salad was good though.  Jen of Kuo gives it 3/5.  Good place to go if you're low on dough.  Order one of the Hawaiian Sun Drinks. Pass-O-Guava was yummy. 8)   Must try the rest next time.

       Jan. 4 -Got an email from Jason Lacsamana asking me to come in to the  urlLink OCAPICA  office Friday.  Mary Anne Foo or as the OCAPICA staff call her “Mafoo” asked if I wouldn’t mind helping out with their fundraiser dinner this March as well as other grunt work.  So yes people, Jen has a temp job (and a paying one) for now at Oh-Cap-Peek-Ah and don’t call it Oh-Caw-Pee-Kah.   Yes, they get really mad at this . ;p   Jason also wanted me to go to diversity training/cultural awareness for the Orange County Police department with him on behalf of OCAPICA. Man, that was an interesting experience.  The  urlLink Orange County Human Relations (OCHR)  was helping hosting this one-day diversity training session.  Bob Cerince from OCHR was there to facilitate w/ the training. There were about 30 cadets from various police departments in OC and even some from LA, as well some people from the OC Sheriff’s department.    All the guys’ heads were shaved and they were all in uniform.  You could feel the testosterone in the air.  I couldn’t believe that a good bunch of them were probably around my age.  Geez, am I that old already?   Most of them were white males a few females, one Black guy, a few Latinos and one Latina, 2 South Asians, one who spoke in a British accent, one Southeast Asian woman and one East Asian man.  Jason remarked how this was the most diverse bunch he had worked with.   So we talked and worked with a couple of the cadets and explained what OCAPICA was about as well as give them a very brief crash course on APIAs in a few minutes, which both Jason and I agree isn’t enough.  The Orange County police departments needs to have longer diversity training sessions at least more than just one day. There needs to be a continuation throughout their line of business.    There were other groups to assist with the training such Ra’id Faraj, Public Relations Director from  urlLink Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)  as well as various LGBT groups.    So Jason and I talked about the diversity of the APIA community.  We also talked about the how they need to get to know their community so they can earn their community’s trust. Because with some APIA groups they need to take account that some APIA groups have had a bad experience back in Asia with corrupted police so they may not trust American police.  Also they might have a negative view of cops due to skewed and hyped portrayals in the media.    Most of them actually seem really receptive and paid close attention to what we were saying.  We just hope they don’t become jaded later in their field because it happens and being a police officer is a tough job, but that’s no excuse for them to lose their fire and open-mindedness they had in the beginning.   I wanted to learn more about what rules there were in the police department for bilingual assistance being that the APIA police is a largely immigrant community. I know in the health care system there are rules and they need professionally trained translators and if it’s a family member I believe they must be 14 years old at least.  I remember reading in my public health class terrible incidences that health care personnel were insensitive to this notion.  So I’m curious in learning what kind of laws, if there are any, in the police department.  True, there not as many technical terms as there are in the health care but I’m curious to know what the rules are.  One of the cadets told me there is this AT&T operator program that provides bilingual assistance.      Bob wanted us to use Sundeep’s case as a scenario.  The 2 cadets from Anaheim in our group were embarrassed to hear what a terrible job the Anaheim PD had done with the case.  I mention how even though Sundeep’s case was an Asian on Asian hate crime, it was hate crime nonetheless and to keep in mind what a hate crime can be as opposed to being an assault.    I was curious to see on the board that someone had given an Asian Cultural Awareness course.  Both Jason and I were curious in finding out who gave this because it had happened before we had arrived and from what I heard from Bob, who was a concerned that the guy, whoever gave the workshop, had passed out a big packet on Asians and when Bob was glancing thru the packet, he noticed that there was description on how to tell what a Cambodian looks like, which seemed insensitive, stereotypical and very damaging. Something OCAPICA and OCHR plans to look into.    Afterwards went back to the OCAPICA office to help out Susan with scanning photos and didn’t leave the office til 8.  Being that I wasn’t planning on goin out that Friday night because I was broke and had originally thought I was goin to Mammoth for the National TACL retreat that Friday so made no plans.  But for some strange reason at the last minute Rob cancelled it because too many ppl had scheduling conflicts or something.   Ah well.  Nothing wrong with a quiet chill night at home.

       Jan. 3 -Noticing that I was involved with recent hate crime prevention events Edwin from  urlLink FX Networks  invited me to the screening of  urlLink  Sins of Father   starring  Tom Sizemore  and  Ving Rhames , at the Zanuck Theatre in the  urlLink Fox Studios  lot in Los Angeles.  It’s about the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama church bombing that killed 4 young Black girls. The movie is based on the “ urlLink The Sins of the Father ” article by Pamela Colloff, which ran in the Texas Monthly.  It is told thru the eyes of Tom Cherry, former KKK member and bombing suspect Bobby Frank Cherry’s son.   So I invited Charmy to go with me to go check it out.  When I was going to UCLA I always used to past by the Fox Studios lot and now I was going to get a chance to go check it out.  We arrived there and they had some security measures, to drive up to the lot, they set it up so that in order to drive in you had to zigzag your way in.  Though they never checked my ID as they said they would.  tsk tsk . Got there early and they had a reception with free food and drinks.  Luckily Charmy came with me or I would have been bored and lonely since everyone else there seemed to know each other or were part of the entertainment industry.  Everyone there seem to be smoozing with each other so Charmy and I hung out with each being that that scene really isn’t our thing.  Though we meet one interesting and friendly writer name Gail? Gale?, who we ending up talking to the whole time and watching the movie with.    After the reception ended they had buses that drove us to Zanuck Theatre.  We past by a building with the Simpsons painted all over it and then arrived at the Zanuck, when I noticed the  red carpet .  Good lawd. They had a couple of photographers snapping photos of the cast and crew.  Tom Sizemore was there.  That was interesting. Would have been even cooler if Ving Rhames was there. After that found a seat in the front since some of the seats were reserved.   Someone from Fox or either FX talked a lil bit about the movie and introduced some of the cast and crew and also Tom Cherry was there.  Both him and Tom Sizemore were sitting a few seats behind me.   Great movie, excellent story and acting, check it out if you have cable.  It airs tonight on FX.  Interesting take on hate crimes, which is a topic that is very relevant to America today, since many Americans seem to want to forget or are unaware of our dirty past, which actually wasn’t too long ago.  This particular case in actually the longest manhunt in FBI history according to the FX networks site.   And too you people that think I’m being anti-American I’m not there’s nowhere else I want to live besides America because I am an American.  I’m saying this because it needs to be said so that our country can continue to improve as a society.  This something that’s not going to change overnight but is going to take years. Plus haven’t you people heard of the first Amendment?  At the end of  Sins of the Father , they mentioned how Bobby Frank Cherry couldn’t stand trial because he was seen as mentally unfit.  But afterwards the movie, someone annouced that just recently a judge declared that Bobby Frank Cherry was faking his illness and was able to stand trial, which will be happening later this month.  To read more about this click to the 2 Washington Post’s articles  urlLink WP article 1   urlLink WP article 2   Afterwards I had mention beforehand to Charmy that I was craving  urlLink Roscoe’s Chicken ‘N Waffles , since in OC we don’t have such fine treasures.  The deal was sealed especially after watching Ving Rhames’ character mom fried some chicken in movie. So went to the one on Pico and I ordered Scoe’s Special #2 with the gravy on the side.  And it was mmmmmm good.  Who would of thought chicken and waffles would make such a great combo.  And not just any fried chicken and waffles.  Some of the best I’ve ever eaten.  Yes, there goes my cholesterol.  Ok, I can’t be eating there for a while especially since I’ve been turning into blubber since I moved back home.

       Jan. 2 -Woke up early to go to Pasadena.  Man, I am not a morning person especially since I didn’t get much sleep the night before.  At the last minute my Uncle Bob decided to close our Pasadena store this December.  So we were goin there to clean up and move the remaining products to our Cerritos store.  My dad had already left to go to the store early that morning to continue with the moving.  My mom, brother, cousin Johnny and I were going to meet up with him later that morning.  By the time we got there we found out that my Uncle Bob had got the dates wrong on the lease and we weren’t going to close til next year.  So all that packing my family had done the day before was a waste. >8( And we didn’t even have to wake up early. So we ended up putting back the stuff we had packed.   My mom decided to call it a day.  So she suggested that we check out the floats from the  urlLink Rose Parade . It was packed. There were ppl from all over. This was the first time I had seen the floats up close.  I wished I had my camera with me.  It’s pretty amazing how detail the floats are in person.  They even turned on a couple of the floats.   The float from China Airlines called “ Enjoying Taiwan ” was in honor of the indigenous Taiwanese.  urlLink (Click here for a sketch version of the float) .  It earned the international trophy.  I wonder which indigenous groups they had represented in particular.  I hope it was an accurate and sensitive portrayal.  Maybe I’ll ask Niwa if she knows what groups.  I noticed  urlLink Pacific Times  had a photo of that float on this week’s front page.

      Went to Peter Chang's place to celebrate New Year's Eve. Peter had candles lit all over his place; there were some out in the patio and even some in the bathroom including the bathtub. Very nice.  *hint hint* guys take note  I also really liked the black lights in his cousin Tom's bathroom.  Hey, so I'm easily entertained . Buncha ppl from TACL as well as Peter's friends and co-workers were there. I tried some  urlLink Smirnoff Ice  for the first time and it was pretty tasty. Unfortunately, since I have no tolerance to alcohol ( damm these genes ) I turned red promptly and got a wonderful headache as well. So I pretty much plopped myself on Peter's super comfortable couch and tried to watch Algeria and Dralion on Bravo.  Yes, jen such the party animal .   Arrgh, it sucks that I can't really drink and I top of that I was still getting over my cold. So for the rest of the night I was entertained by watching Jason and Randy dance around. I won't describe it because I don't think I would be able to give it justice. It's freakin' hilarious is all I'll say. Jason was pretty wasted. Being loud and obnoxious. I'm sure Suan was really proud. I was very entertained by making Jason lift up his shirt, lick his fingers and rub his nipples.  Nice visual I know . ;p   The party didn't end til 4ish. Peter though crashed before all his guest lefts so we decided to have a lil fun with our defenseless host. hehe. No one had any permanent markers on them so all the girls took some photos with our sleeping beauty. The guys were going to take one with Peter as well but Peter looked like he was about to wake up so we stopped. I ended up crashing at Peter's place as well as some other ppl since I thought Rich and Pason's place would be packed.  By the time I woke up I was the last guest left at Peter's place since Jason had to take his sister Joannie to LAX that morning. So I helped Peter clean up the place.   Later went to Rich and Pason's aparto and found that everyone was pretty dead. Grace and James were the only ones awake. Eventually we woke up Jason, Rob and Rich. Pason on the other hand was a lost cause so we left him at the aparto. Went to K-town to treat Grace to a birthday lunch at  Hodori  . Man, I love that place. It's 24/7/365. Can you believe that? And it scored an A. Saw Huey, one of the OG TACL members there. We ordered almost everything off the menu and pretty much ate up everything. Afterwards I went home since I had only 5 hours of sleep. Took a nice shower and went to sleep early since I found out at the last minute my family wanted me to be in Pasadena early morning to help with our Pasadena Hallmark store.  Arrgh . 8(

       Finally, Blog is back up.   Well, here's the post I was planning to have up awhile back.    Cough cough hack hack  hairball… mmm phlegm . Ah yes it’s great to be sick. Yes, everybody jen caught a cold for Christmas. bleah. Any cute and single doctors in the house? Or any single male cuties that want to play doctor? heh heh   Yes, I’ve been pretty unproductive this past couple days.  Though I did go out to post-Christmas shopping (madness I say, MADNESS) at South Coast Plaza with Ricardo.  And I just came to the sad realization that I have no clue in buying clothes and shoes for guys.  Let’s say I’m not your typical girl.  Plus my love life is non-existent so I haven’t had to worry about that.  I don’t follow fashion trends and what not so I have no idea what’s in or out and I don’t really care to know what’s chic or like ya know so like 5 minutes ago. So what I usually buy guys are comics, art supplies, stuff from  urlLink Skeletons in the Closet ,  urlLink LA County’s Coroners gift shop  or mini-riceburner toy cars or other random gag gifts.  Hey, man I can’t afford expensive shit.  Jen is still in ghetto student mode.   But back to shopping story Richard couldn’t find anything he wanted to buy so we headed over to  urlLink Mitsuwa  formerly known as Yaohan since he starving and as I was ordering a curry pan from their bakery I noticed the woman I was buying it from was Janet’s mom.  Small world, indeed.    BTW another one of my high school friends is getting married.  For those of you who know Erin Yenny, she’s getting married to Joe this June.  Another one bites the dust.  Uh… I mean congratulations. Yeah, that’s it. ;p    And is it just me or did everyone have  huo guo  for Christmas? Rich’s family did so did Steve’s family.

      So guess what jen instead? I WENT SHOPPING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's pampering jen time.  8)   First went to  urlLink Staples  for some office supplies.  Then went to  urlLink Sterling Art , one of the dopest art stores in SoCal, to get some goodies. They have SO MUCH stuff.  You could leave me there all day. Everything there is so cool.  I WANT IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!! True, you'll be able to find some products at other art places for a cheaper price, but they have such a huge selection of....pretty much everything you can imagine.  Great selection of handmade and decorative paper.  So purty .    Afterwards had an urge for Boba, so I went to  urlLink Tapioca Express , since I was low on dough (meaning I couldn't afford Tea Station) and I wanted to check out their store in Irvine.  The balls were a bit on the mushy side.  Eh.  Should have gone to Valley Cafe ( where I was boba deflowered ) or Champion Foods ( Randy's family store ).  Next went to my other favorite store,  urlLink Target , to look for a CD rack to store all my CDs.  But I didn't find anything that really caught my eye.   That means next shopping run will be at  urlLink IKEA  to check out their CD storage units.  Haven't been there forever because: 1) I don't have place of my own or really a room of my own so why torture myself 2) I was broke before so I couldn't really buy anything.   Though my interior decorating will look like every other person's room .  So I'm also going to try to check out some cool furniture stores I saw in LA.  Because jen must be unique...nono more unique. ;p   Another random note.  I missed  urlLink Cold Tofu's  "The Soy of Sex" performance because jen is getting too tired of driving back and forth to Lost Angeles to Costa Messy.  And gas prices are going up again.  So anyone want to be my slave and drive me around?  My multiple personalities, invisible friends and the lil blue fairy that sits on my shoulder make great company.

      Now for jen to rave and rant-What’s up with these freakin’ spam emails about these singles match ads.  So annoying.  I got one in almost all of my email accounts and it seemed to be all in the same day. What’s really peeves me, is that I’m getting ones that are geared for guys.  HELLO, I’m a female and heterosexual.  Maybe I’ll should change teams.  Nah, as much as guys can be such shitheads, there are those rare and few amazing MEN that are out there.  And I like the male species too much.  Geez, check out my website.  Man, I’m sad.  If only, there were some single ones out there.  * sigh * Anyways.  Down hormones down.

        YAH!!! My cousin Jenny won the  urlLink 2002 Mrs. Chinese U.S.A. Pageant Most Photogenic award .    Yeah yeah, it's Chinese and it should be Taiwanese.  But my cousin's down.  She one of my few relatives, that was happy to hear about my active involvment with TACL.  She can't wait to enroll her 2 sons into our TACL-LID programs, once they're old enough.    I usually don't care for events like these,  but Jenny's such a sweetheart, that her beauty within is what truly shines.  ( Corny, I know, but it's true.)  8)  And she's giving away her money to her school, so that's cool.   Plus, I think she's a babe.  I mean wouldn't you want to look that good after 2 kids?   Yeah, yeah I know I'm being biased.  ;p

      Well, ate like a pig at Sharon & Lydell’s Super Bowl get together.  We got pretty tired of watching the game so decided to play some b-ball. BAD IDEA, especially for someone that hasn’t worked out in ages and is getting old because I’m REALLY feeling it.   Augh!!!!  The pain. Usually, when your normal average person goes to work out, they like the burn, they feel the following days….. well not wimp ass jen .  Put me out of my misery.  A bubble bath sounds good right now….wait wait nonono a bubble bath with a single, sexy, heterosexual man or two. ;p  who’s a masseur….  hint hint   to any of y’all jen of kuo wouldn’t mind a spa certificate for her birthday.    After the game watched  Vertical Limit . My comments: I have no real desire to watch it twice.  I mean it wasn’t that bad but it wasn’t that good.  Where do I start the missing toes, the dislocated fingers…. bleah .  Let’s just say I’m glad to be living in sunny Socal.   Sharon and Lydell also announced that they have decided to move to Viva Lost Wages this coming summer. 8( Now both of my best friends are moving out of state.  Janet just emailed me to tell her she’s moving in June with her boyfriend Brian to Oregon in June.  8(    But back to my pain (that’s right pity me) couldn’t even concentrate when I went to go tutoring today.  Just watched Gabriel and Audrey do their thing.  I’m glad to see the after school program going somewhere.    Onto to some sad news  David Hwang , a great leader and contributor to the Taiwanese, Taiwanese American, Asian American and TACL community passed away a few days ago.    TACL would not be the organization it is today without his leadership especially the programs he was instrumental in, the programs which help to empower the second generation Taiwanese American community.  His presence and spirit will be greatly missed by our community.

      BTW I've decided I'm not goin to drive my ass to Rosemead for the National TACL board meeting.  Rob-what were you thinking?  On Superbowl Sunday?  Especially 9 in freakin' morning.  I DON'T THINK SO!!!!  Jen is sleeping in. That's right.  I'll get the cliff notes version of the meeting later.   Augh so many events in Feb. and only one Jen....you would think multiple personalities would help.  But nooooooo.    Man, I need to make more friends that are single, not married or not part of the C.O.T.I.S.O. (Cult of the Inseparable Significant Others) in OC.     And what's up with pervs emailing me.  I should post some of pics they sent.  Ah hilarious.  Yes, I know how mean.  But they wrote some messed up shit. One guy wanted a father AND daughter role playing thing.   SICK!  That's role playing on a whole another level.  That's why I changed my Yahoo profile.   ***shiver***

      Well, I missed the parade this morning cuz I didn’t hear my alarm go off.  But I did go check out the cultural faire. In all my years of living in OC, I’ve never seen such a large number of African Americans together.   I was expecting a lil more from the cultural faire ( yeah yeah who I am to talk I missed the whole beginning part ).  But it’s good to see such an event happening.  Hope they get more funding ( hey broke ass Jen who still hasn’t been paid for either of her jobs and got her ATM card stolen last week donated ) and I hope to see more ppl helping out with the organization of the event next year. This event has so much potential and could be so much more.  Would have been cool to see more orgs and more health organizations booths.  And I was expecting more with the music line-up.  The blues band 3rd degree was not bad.  But I was expecting a lot more from the hip hop tip.  But this is OC…anyways.  But it was cool to see in their program that they included other ethnic groups like the United Samoan Org and some Vietnamese dance.   But I was amazed by the fact that OC Register was one of the sponsors.  Maybe they’re trying to improve.   I’m curious to see what their reviews of this event are going to be.     Afterwards I went home to chill for bit.  Tried to call some ppl to see if they were interested in going to check out the  urlLink Artists Village in Santa Ana .  What there’s such a thing in OC?  Yup! I know I was pretty amazed by the fact when I found out last year. Last month I invited Charmy to go with me to go check it out and I really dug it. Loved the old historic buildings ( yup OC has history too, pretty unbelievable, huh? ) and I was happy to see such place like this exist in OC.  The sad thing is I bet most ppl in OC have no idea such a place exists or wouldn’t appreciate such a treasure. But then again it’s still relatively new so I guess it’s just going to take time. This month one of the galleries is celebrating Black History month with an exhibition called “Bones as Well.”  It was nice.  But could be much more.    It was cool to see in the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art feature on an artist Jen-Hsin Lin, who I believe is Taiwanese because I saw a gathering of 1st gen that were busting out in  daige /Taiwanese.  Warm fuzzies.  8)    But I plan on checking out the Artists Village during the day.  Saw some cool theatre spaces.  Hmmm…..you’ll see my pretties what I have in mind.   And I saw a lack of something in their schedule but I’m going to do something so that it’s not missing.  What is it? I won’t say yet.  This shall be jen of kuo’s brainchild.  Cue in evil laughter .  ;)

      Augh, I just found out Concrete Blonde was performing at the  urlLink Galaxy Concert Theatre  tonite.  8(  Oh well, it's not like I really have money.  8'( Plus I was at work til 8ish.  But I was surfing the net and I found out that tomorrow in Santa Ana, there's going to be a  urlLink Black History Parade and Cultural Faire .  Can you believe that?  And it's in its 22nd year!!! I'm impressed, especially since I heard the African American population by pecentage in OC had decreased according to Census 2000 reports. Well, what can you expect from the Orange Curtain.  OC still doesn't truly appreciate it's diversity and it's only a friendly place on the surface level.  But I can go on and go on, on this topic...like when I was updating OCAPICA's database and I was looking for elected officials most of them were Republicans. And let's not get on South OC.  But I plan on checking the parade. Hopefully I can get myself to wake up tomorrow morning to take some photos and possibly some community networking.   Man, I'm not going to be able to sleep in this weekend (AGAIN.)

       Happy Birthday to my dad .  Just came back from eating at  George’s Thai Bistro  in Santa Ana.  I’ve been wanting to check it out since  urlLink OC Weekly  ranked it as one of the best things in  urlLink Santa Ana 2001 .  I ordered the Mu Ping (BBQ Pork) and I was expecting better.  The pork was good but what’s up with the sauce?  I could have sworn it was Teriyaki sauce.  I felt cheated.  This is dish for ignorant OC white Americans, that don't know better.   Ah well.   But my parent’s dishes looked a lot better.  I should have ordered a spicy dish.   Next time I want good and cheap Thai food I will have to go to LA.    And before I forget here are some March Birthdays.  Happy Birthday to  Michelle Tseng  (24),  Yingka Chou  (20) aka Wild Child (my right hand woman, you'll find out who my special guest is) and  Jeremy Afuso  (25).

      Anyone want to go to  urlLink Coachella  with me? BTW if you want to be my sugar daddy and pay for my tickets, I'll let you just this one time cuz I'm such a great person like that. ;p ( Yeah yeah you can stop laughing now, see what great FRIENDS I have ) I've been wanting to go since the first one, but I was a dork and didn't go buy tickets.  So this year the jen of kuo is going and she's going to pay ridiculous amounts of money because  urlLink Goldenvoice  is evil.  I've denied myself too long.  Come on it's been years since I've been to a real concert. (Sad, I know).  And for you ppl that have been living in caves *  ahem  *  you know who you are.  I'm talking about Coachella, the music and arts festival April 27-28.  Didn't you ppl read in my email, " For more info go http://www.coachella.com  ".  Sheesh!   I mean I love you guys.  But come on, read my stinkin' emails.  I know I don't have the greatest grammer and I can be a major cornball.  But I don't think I could have made it any simpler.   Anywho, had a nice laugh about that with Theo.    People who are interested so far: Stefanie  Richard Ed  BTW doesn't  Shirley Bassey  just rock? 8) Me thinks it's time for jen to go karaoking again.

      Mike was watching Leno last nite and I noticed one of his guests was  urlLink Thoth .  You’re probably wondering who? Yeah, I didn’t know his name either until I saw him appear on the  urlLink Oscars  show this year, when they were announcing the nominees for the short documentary films; they had showed a clip of  urlLink Thoth by Sarah Kernochan and Lynn Appelle .  And I was thinking OHMIGAWD I saw that dude in  urlLink Central Park  back in August with Chiutoy.  Steve was giving me a tour of Central Park during the summer since it was my first time there during that season.  We had gone with his other roommates Rob and Howard and we were chilling in Sheep Meadow (I think) and watching vendors sell alcohol illegally in brown paper bags.  Steve was making remarks about this very out and about foursome sitting near us, saying how they could start a boy band since they had an Asian guy and a Black guy.   And me being the immature perv that I am was trying very hard not to laugh when I noticed one of them licking his Big Stick Popsicle.  Oh come on you know you would have as well.   And let me tell  you it look like the boy knew what he was doing and probably did it well. Ahahaha bad bad I know. And you could just imagine the look of guys’ faces I was with.  You had to have been there.

      Been listening to and downloading  urlLink Teresa Teng  songs (especially her Taiwanese songs and the ones my dad doesn't have).  I blame it all on the Thailand trip.   During the tour, at some of the restaurants we ate at, there were Thai singers that sang songs in English, Mandarin and Taiwanese even ( dope! ).   And some of those songs they sang were popular Teresa Teng songs. So ever since Thailand, I've been having Teresa Teng songs stuck in my head.  Especially her "The Moon Represents My Heart" song. When we went  Chiang Mai , our tour guide told us this was the city where Teng passed away from an asthma attack.  I remember when I heard about her passing I was shocked that she could have died so young.  She had a huge following and was internationally known, one of Asia's pioneer singers.    When I was younger I used to like listening to her songs, since she was one of my favorite and few Asian artists I liked of my dad's collection of music.

      I got to meet  Peggy Bundy ! (Well,  urlLink Katey Sagal , the actor that plays her is what I mean)    After the  urlLink MANAA  dinner meeting at Stefanie's, Edwin invited me to go to Encino to go to “ urlLink The Shield ” party, which was at Katey Sagal’s house.  Her place is huge.  A bunch of cast and crew were in one of her many rooms watching the “Blowback” episode, which was written by Kurt Sutter, who Edwin told me Katey Sagal is seeing.  Edwin introduce to some of the cast and crew such as Kurt and the guy who plays Detective “Dutch”.  I believe I also saw the creator of “The Shield”. And meaning being the dork that I am, when I was being introduced to the actor that played Dutch, said “Aren’t you the guy that plays Dutch?”  Yes, you can’t take me anywhere .  Edwin also introduced me to Katey, which was really cool.     But check out next week episode our own  urlLink Kelvin Yu , who I saw in the trailer is appearing in the “Cherrypoppers,” which airs Tuesday, April 16 on  urlLink FX Networks .

       Jen of Kuo's WOMEN WHO FUCKIN' ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Series.     This week I shall feature- SOJOURNER TRUTH   I had first read about Sojourner Truth, when researching for a paper back in HS and I came upon her  "Ain't I A Woman?" speech and feel in deep admiration for her.  How can you not admire someone like that?    Below is the speech.   That's right, Sojourner, you tell them like it is .      AIN'T I A WOMAN?  by Sojourner Truth   Delivered 1851 at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio    Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this here talking about?   That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman?   Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this they call it? [member of audience whispers, "intellect"] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?   Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.   If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back , and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.   Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain't got nothing more to say.    For more info on this amazing woman go to the  urlLink Sojourner Truth Institute  website

      Not really feelin’ the guy species ( and yes there’s a difference between guys and MEN .) First, I was having the problem of meeting any alive or breathing males especially ones that would keep their word or don’t have an Asian fetish.  I swear I must have in my former life done something very bad . Anyhow…well since I’ve moved back to OC, my situation improved a lil bit I could attract some breathing ones.  But I would later find out   they were either maniac depressives or jerks that enjoyed belittling me. Woo hoo! Yes, Jen knows how to attract them.  Then I meet some potentials and one ends up flaking on me A LOT and well, the other one…..I’ll put it simply doesn’t want to date me even though he’s interested.  WTF?   Oh, does jen have stories.  She has stories.  Which volume would you like?  I’ve come to resolution that I shall be doomed to attracting guys and reflecting men.  And that all the good men left are in a relationship.  ( Yes, I know that’s not an original thought since I’m sure there’s tons of other ppl that have come to this conclusion .) But let me sing you a tale and you WILL UNDERSTAND.   But I know there are ppl that have meet that someone or potential someone and I’m happy for Janet, Erin, Rich and Elson.  LUCKY BASTARDS!    Who me bitter? Cynical? Nooooooooo .   Jen of Kuo is giving up on having relationship. THAT’S RIGHT, at the age of 24.  Well, Steve, I guess we’re never going to lose our bet.  Here’s to singledoom.  And yes CALIE guys suck and are stupid.   BTW don’t mind me.  Jen’s fun day must be coming soon.  Just can’t wait for my Aunt Flo to visit me. BLEAH!

And the next X-Men movie better have an Asian American  actor for Jubilee. In the deleted DVD version, she looks it. I was so PO'd when I saw the lame ass 1996 Generation X TV show.  Don't know if anyone remembers it but they had a freakin' white girl play the CHINESE AMERICAN Jubilee.  Grrrrrr. >8O  Glad the show tanked cuz it SUCKED.   Anywho.  Yes, Jen is bored.   Should be working out but too tired. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

        Woo hoo! Jen of Kuo is actually workin’ out. That’s right I finally got off my lazy ass and joined  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness . Ever since I moved back from to OC, I do less and less walking because you see, getting around UCLA was a workout, especially since half of the campus is uphill and then with all those stairs (AUGH!)  I bet if I tried walking around campus now, I’ll be so pooped.  And yes Jen is dork and never even ONCE went to the gym at school.  YES, I’M A FOOL!    Anyhow, got a really good deal signing up with my co-workers and basically I’m just paying 12 buckaroos a month for 3 years.  Niiiiice . I know.  So far I’ve been going to swim for an hour.  And man was I sore after swimming for an hour on Monday.  Was feelin’ a bit sore throughout the week but I’ll admit it felt kinda good.  And just finished swimming for another hour today. WHO DA WOMAN? JEN DA WOMAN!!!! ARRGH  rips off shirt and blinds the innocent bystanders  ;p  A lil disappointed that the South Coast Metro Sports Club has only a 3 lane pool and you can’t even dive and there’s no starting blocks.   Ah well . It’s a lot better 24 Hour Fitness, then the one I used to go to.  I was so pissed off when I signed up there with Sharon because I only had membership to that gym and not other 24 Hour Fitnesses.  And of course what happens when I signed up to that one.  They open another freakin’ 24 Hour Fitness in Costa Mesa and that one had a pool.  I’m glad my new membership gives me access to all 24 Hour Sports Club.  Going to try to make it to those power sculpt and yoga classes. Might as well make use of my money.  My co-workers and I have made a promised to go to the gym at least 12 times a month.   But looking for a new workout buddy, I don’t mind swimming alone but it’s not as fun looking like a fool on the treadmills or stairmaster w/o someone else to look stupid with ya or at least laugh with or at ya.   It was always fun looking like a fool with Sharon.   Oh, do we have stories.  8)  Need a new partner in crime that’s single.  *sigh*  Can't wait til I get my guest passes in the mail.

       Diamonds are forever, They are all I need to please me,  They can stimulate and tease me,  They won't leave in the night,  I've no fear that they might desert me.     Diamonds are forever,  Hold one up and then caress it,  Touch it, stroke it and undress it,  I can see ev'ry part,  Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.    I don't need love,  For what good will love do me?  Diamonds never lie to me,  For when love's gone,  They'll lustre on.     Diamonds are forever,  Sparkling round my little finger.  Unlike men, the diamonds linger;  Men are mere mortals who Are not worth going to your grave for.    I don't need love,  For what good will love do me?  Diamonds never lie to me,  For when love's gone,  They'll lustre on.     Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.  Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.  Forever and ever.

      Man, it's freaking 2:30 in the morning and I'm still working on the hate crimes presentation I have to give in Fullerton.  I HATE WAKING UP EARLY.  I feel like I’m in school again. BLEAH!   I'm going to be soooo pooped since I have a freakin' MANAA meeting later that day in LA.  Yeah, I get to battle the 405. 8(  Cruel, cruel world. And why do I keep saying freakin'. DAMM YOU ALL!!!!!!  BTW I'll be posting a "nice" rant on why #$%@^ guys suck.  Okay, not all guys, gay guys are wonderful.  8) Seriously, I’ve been pretty depressed and down, because of all the crapola I’ve had to deal with that OTHER gender. (But Pason you don’t count, you rock. Sorry for the waterworks and thanks for listening and understanding. Going to miss my fellow couch potato bud.)  What happened to me this past weekend has gotten me only a lot more jaded and cynical on that fuckin’ thing called love.  I only know so well, when guys hate it when girls give them, the whole “let’s be friends” deal.  Shiiit. Yeah, I have a potty mouth, whatja goin to do about, JACKASS! (Good lawd, I’m suppose to speak to teachers today? Ai-yo!)   But back to my luvlies…lately, it’s been mainly gay guys that have given my self-esteem a boost, as well as with a smile on my face. They don’t leave me with tears of heartache and pains but tears from laughing too hard. I swear, I’m with a group of people, that has as a * ahem * creative mind as me.  Maybe I’m a gay guy trapped in a breeder’s body.  Dammit, why do I have to like guys?  And why do I attract the ones, I attract.  Aren’t there any nice ones that will have the decency to call me back, remember my birthday, keep their word, don’t have an Asian fetish, won’t flake, won’t demean and make me feel inferior, won’t forget that he made a date with me, aren’t cheap asses, not use me, break my heart and the list goes on. 8(    Yeah, do I know how to choose them or what?   It would be so nice, if there someone, who would like to be more than friends, who would return the snuggle, would actually call me his date and actually really take me out on an ACTUAL date, would ask me to dance, would remember my name after the first introduction (geez, like Jennifer is a REALLY hard name to remember), was interested in me and not one of my friends ...   *sigh*  And before you start saying hey you can ask the guy out, I have, and I’ve paid for both our dinners, I’ve paid for the movie, I’ve driven and I usually am the one doing the asking for slow dances.  Man, my middle name should be doormat. Geez, I’m sad.  And I’m publishing this for the whole worldwide web to see.  Okok, I went on a lil longer than I was going to.  And I really need to get back the presentation. So I’ll stop before I really get myself into a terrible funk.  But don’t worry I have more to say.  Volume 53453246236 is on its way.  And with my record, there’s only more to come.   Yes, you may now start playing the violins.    Jen of Kuo, the fag hag in training

      Another restaurant to add to Jen of Kuo's new list of good places to eat in OC.   Gotta check out  urlLink P.J.'s Abbey . It's an old gothic style, Victorian Baptist Church that was restored and changed into a restaurant. The OCAPICA staff was trying to figure out what to eat for lunch, and some of the staff wanted something healthy to eat, so Mary Anne suggested P.J.'s Abbey. I tried the Grilled Portobella Mushroom Sandwich, and that was very yummy.  Though the white chocolate bread pudding was even yummier.  One of the better bread puddings I've tried.  One of those great comfort foods to have on a cold, windy day.  It was so nice and warm and it wasn't too sweet.  mmmmmmmmmm   I LOVE Old Towne Orange.  Great food and cute historic buildings. It's like you're going back in time.  Wish more of OC was like this, I'm a sucker for historic buildings. 8)   == Oh yeah, another Asian guy won Fear Factor. That's right it's payback time for all those time they've used API culture for exploitation.

I give up, I'm dying single.   Anywho, onto more of my random rambling, was checking out the old TACL LID site www.tacl-lid.org  (I'm not goin to link it cuz you'll see why)  and noticed it's turned into an Asian porn site.  *sheesh*  That's just great, people.  People who still have the old link, are going to be wondering, "What the hell kinda camp am I sending my kids to?" Then again, we might get more campers.... I can see it know all these Taiwanese parents wondering, why their sons want to enroll in camp so badly.

      Okay, since we’re on the bathroom talk, I thought I would find the poopie list.      POOPIE LIST     GHOST POOPIE:  The kind where you feel the Poopie come out, but there's no poopie in the toilet.    CLEAN POOPIE:  The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.    WET POOPIE:  The kind where you wipe your butt fifty times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you don't runie them with a stain.    SECOND WAVE POOPIE:  The kind that happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize you have to poopie some more.    TURTLE POOPIE:  The kind of poopie that pops out a little and goes back in a few times before it finallly comes out    POP-A-VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD-POOPIE:  The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.    LINCOLN LOG POOPIE:  The kind of Poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the plunger.    GAS-SY POOPIE:  The kind where it's so noisy, everyone within earshot is giggling!    DRINKER POOPIE:  The kind of Poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet.    CORN POOPIE:  (Self explanatory)    GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOP POOPIE:  The kind where you want to Poopie, but all you do is it on the toilet and fart a few times.    SPINAL TAP POOPIE:  That's the kind when it hurts so badly coming out, you swear it was leaving you sideways.    WET CHEEKS POOPIE:  (The Power Dump). The kind that comes out of your butt so fast, your butt cheeks get spashed with water.    LIQUID POOPIE: The kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots you of your butt and spashes all over the toilet bowl.    MEXICAN POOPIE:  The kind that smells so bad your nose burns.    UPPER CLASS POOPIE:  The kind of Poopie that doesn't smell.    THE SURPRISE POOPIE:  You are not even at the toilet, because you are sure you are about to fart, but, OOPS---a Poopie!    THE DANGLING POOPIE:  This Poopie refuses to drop into the toilet even though you know you are done poopie-ing. You just pray that a shake or two will cut it loose.   I remember this list back in high school, it was hilarious, I couldn’t stop laughing, my friends and cousins would make copies of this list and give it to our friends.  Ah, yes the days before email.  Funny thing, is that I think a lot of us laugh, because of experience.  ;p   And best poopie website.  urlLink www.doodie.com

        DEEEE-gusting!    Geez, just came back from my work’s office building restroom.  You would expected being that you need a key to use the building’s restroom, it would be cleaner.   Cha!  Ghetto ass girls, I swear, I thought girls would be cleaner.    Someone left her present. And this is not the first time.  I swear.  Is it that hard to flush the toilet again, so the next person, can have clean bowl?  I mean I have no problem, if you gotta do #2, cuz when you gotta go, you gotta go, but do you have to share it with everybody?    Oh, I have more stories, freakin’ ppl that throw away their sanitary napkins in the toilet and clog it up.  Okay, I can understand, if it’s the first time you got your period, but I don’t remember seeing anyone in their training bras in our office building.  NASTY!     Then there are the ppl, that you know just did #2, that don’t even bother washing their hands.  I mean, not washing with soap, is pretty sick, as is, but I’ve seen ppl that just straight walk out, no water or soap.  EWWWW.

        In  urlLink TheSpark.com's  Pickup line test, I'm.... drumroll please.    What's up frigidaire. You are 29%  pickup-able! You're cold and unapproachable, like a big glacier that's unapproachable. And cold. Unlike the Arctic tundra, few even venture to plant their flag in you. You're definitely not a Scorpio, unless you were born between October 23 and November 21. The bad news is that you'll end up miserable and alone, probably knitting doilies out of cat hair. The good news is that this is apparently  what you want.  Honestly, I don't even feel comfortable talking to you right now, so I'm just gonna go&#133; yeah&#133; wash my friend's hair.   Hmmmm...this might explain things.

        Other news    Unity Games 2002 seemed to be pretty successful.  Spent all day Friday picking up freebie stuff for the youth. Wished I had more time, cuz there were some companies I had wished I had hit up.  Was completely exhausted after Saturday.   The youth were so starstruck by  urlLink Keiko Agena , who came to help out Ryan Suda for the  urlLink Blacklava  booth.  Anne mention, how one of youth even screamed, when they recognized her. And when one of the youth was shaking Keiko’s hand, the youth responded by saying that she would never wash that hand.   haha.  Most of the youth kept running to the Blacklava booth, when I was running the spirit games/team building games.  One of them even asked, do you think she’ll play with us. ;p   Anyhow the next Unity Games should even be big and better since the  urlLink Dodgers  want to work with us next year.  Another big event down.  Just the policy symposium left for year 2002.    ===================   Other interesting and cool news    Juan, one of the youth I used to tutor at Century Day School, who currently is back in regular school, told one of the current Century students, to say hi to me.  How sweet is that? 8) He still remembers me.   And a couple weeks ago, Suzanna, who wants to go by Katrina now, another youth that used to go to Century Day, asked Luis to give me one of her glamour shots photos. I’m usually not a fan of those glamour shot photos, cuz I honestly think they’re cheesy being that they put all those filters.  But this is a case, when it’s not so.  I’m very proud to have one of her photos.  And I was really touched that she still thought of me.  8’)  I was also talking to Chandi and Audrey and I guess Daniel only wants tutoring from me.  It’s so hard to tell cuz I get sooo much whining from him.  But I guess it can’t be too bad being that he refuses to get help from either Chandi or Audrey, when I’m not there for tutoring Wed. thru Fri.  Go fig. ;p   Guess I’m making some kinda impacted on these guys lives. Warm fuzzies everybody! 8)   = Was randomly surfing and went to the  urlLink 10BASS T  website, to see if it got updated since, when I meet up with Scott, a couple months ago with his new manager Mike.  Mike had mentioned, that Solrac aka Carlos Mena, had emailed him for something.  I guess Carlos had updated the 10BASS T site a bit cuz there was new link to  urlLink Casa Mena .  Guess he’s doing things solo.  Wished they still had the 10BASS T sound cuz I really liked it. Hope his new album is good.  Wished I had known that he was going to be in Socal, cuz not only did he go to LA but OC as well.  And I missed it.  Ah well.  Next time I guess. Though I’m a lil peeved he never sent me a CD, after he said he would.  I had search thru so many different music stores, hoping to find a copy but nothing…until good old  urlLink Amoeba .  And what was even better, it was for only a buck!

      Guess who finally got her arse to gym?  Ms. Jen of Kuo, that’s who.  It’s about time.  The last time I went was probably June.  5 months went to waste.   tsk tsk I know.   I just don’t like working out without a buddy.  I need someone to be silly with, as well, as someone to motivate me, plus it’s a lot more fun working out with someone.  So I talked to Anne from work and we decided that we would make an effort to go after work.  Did some stretching, then did some weights and then went on the treadmill for half an hour.  Walked for 15 minutes and then ran for 15 minutes.  Not too bad for my first day back.   Even tried those big balls thingies ( I have no idea what they are called ) but I had a hell of a time keeping my balance.  And I wonder what ppl do, if they’re really gassy and they have to do weights or stretch.  ;p   BTW if anyone wants to have a good laugh at the gym, you should take me.  When I first got my 24 Hour Fitness membership with Sharon.  We… okay maybe it was just me , but anyhow some people would look at me, as if I was some nut.  This one time, this one elderly gentleman, looked at me, when I was working out on one of the weight lifting machines and couldn’t help but laugh at me, but he helped me out.  Then another time, when I went to Sharon’s aerobics class at OCC, I was completely lost since it was my first time doing aerobics and I didn’t know any of the moves.  Her own instructor was giving me looks, like oooookay. Sharon couldn’t help from laugh. I swear all those scenes you see in those comedy films are inspired by me.   Yes, I’m sad, what can I say?   ;p   Anywayz want to try their aerobics class, like yoga, kickboxing, and body sculpt, which Audrey suggested I should try.  But I don’t know I’ll be able to workout tomorrow because I sooooooooo know I’m going to feel it tomorrow.  Anyone want to rub some ben gay on me? SEXY SEXY. har har  MMMMMM  mint-tay!  And you want to hear, how much more of a dork I am? I brought a lock and since I hadn’t been to the gym for awhile, I forgot my combination.  DOH!

      Augh! Why only in Eww Yuck? Found out that  urlLink Hard Nut  is going to be in NY.  Why not something in CA? I've been wanting to see this performance, since I caught a couple minutes of their show on PBS, way back when. But noooooooo I couldn't finish it since I had to go to my relatives.  The few minutes I caught were hilarious.  And now they're going to perform in NY. WHY? WHY?   Anyone want to buy me tickets to the show, as well as tickets to NY?

       urlLink   Recap of Saturday   Called up Amy to see if she was up to go to  urlLink Rootdown’s  5th Anniversary.  Always heard positive things about Rootdown and wanted to finally check out one of their events. And I wanted to go especially since I heard  urlLink Breakestra  was performing and I’ve been hearing about them for awhile and that they’re great band to see live.   So we decided to catch dinner in LA.  And being that I’ve made it my goal in life to try as many different, yummy restaurants, I wanted to try something new.  Heck, if I’m driving my butt up the dreaded 405 in the rain, it better be worth it.  So I did some searching off the  urlLink LA Weekly  and  urlLink losangeles.citysearch.com .   I’ve wanted to try some tapas places here in LA, ever since I went to  urlLink Helena's  in NY with Steve, after we had just watched the  urlLink Blue Man Group .  Wanted to find something not too expensive, and Cobras & Matadors looked too expensive and it got mixed reviews, so I choose  La Paella , a Spanish-Mediterranean Restaurant, it’s close to the Beverly Center, since I could only find glowing reviews and the price seem reasonable.   urlLink Click here  for one of the reviews I found  Found FREE parking right in front of restaurant. WOO HOO! Though, had some trouble finding La Paella, since it’s not on the main street of San Vicente, but on a small street. You’ll see what I mean, if you ever go.  It’s basically looks like this old house, which got converted into a restaurant.  Really small and quaint.  One of those places you would take your date.  Though since both Amy and I are single, we can still enjoy things that are apparently only reserved for couples. DAMMIT! Down with the disempowering couple structure! ARRR  (someone bitter?)    Anwayz, asked the host, if any seats would be available, and he said nothing would be until 9:30, mind you, we got there at around 8ish.  Felt like kickin’ myself, for not making reservations, you would think I would learn from the Bic Runga experience.  But noooooooooo .  But the host said if we didn’t mind we could eat at the bar.  Which we did, though Amy wanted to bounce, since she didn’t get a seat until later.    So we made the most of it.  They served us some really yummy sourdough bread with garlic mayo.  Mmmmmmmmmm .  Ordered their vegetable paella and some tapas.  A fried calamari, scallops and chicken croquette.  They were okay, the NY restaurant had more selection.  But their paella was excellent, IMHO much better than the one in NY.  But both Amy and I were so full from the bread, we had to doggy bag the rest of it. Alas no dessert this time.   So we head down to downtown. As we were parking, I noticed in the next car, was  urlLink DJ Shortkut  chilling in his car, looking either bored or tired.  For some reason, they hadn’t open the event and ppl were still waiting outside. Ran into Paul Dang, the brain behind Native Tongh zine in line.    When we finally got in, it was slow to start.  But it got much better, when Breakestra went stage.  And let me tell you.  They’re freaking amazing.  Wow! So talented. Some members would play for awhile, then take a break, and dance with the crowd and went back up.  They threw a few free shirts in my direction, but alas there was always someone taller who got it.  Bleah .  Had a great time, nonetheless, and it looked like Amy did as well. It’s been awhile since I attended a venue with good music.   Great, friendly crowd.  Sick of tried of yuppie places with fake and plastic ppl and shitty music.

      Bic Runga's  Beautiful Collision  is wonderful.  Went so well together, with the weather we just had.   But currently I'm really feeling her old song  Sway .  *sigh*    Sway    Don't stray Don't ever go away I should be much too smart for this You know it gets the better  Of me  Sometimes When you and I collide I fall into an ocean of you Pull me out in time Don't let me drown Let me down I say it's all because of you And here I  Go Losing my  Control I'm practising your name So I can say it To your face it doesn't Seem right To look you in the eye And let all the things You mean to me  Come tumbling out my mouth  Indeed it's time Tell you why I say it's  Infinitely true Say you'll stay Don't come and go Like you do Sway my way Yeah I need to know All about you And there's no cure And no way to be sure Why everythings turned inside out Instilling so much doubt  It makes me so tired I feel so uninspired My head is battling with my heart My logic has been torn apart And now It all turns sour Come sweeten  Every afternoon Say you'll stay  Don't come and go Like you do Sway my way Yeah I need to know All about you Say you'll Stay Don't come and go Like you do Sway my way Yeah I need to know All about you Its all because of you Its all because of you Now it all turns sour Come sweeten  Every afternoon It's time Tell you why I say it's Infinitely true Say you'll stay      -Bic Runga

      Gosh, do I attract the freaks or what?  I logged online and some random dude IMs me via Yahoo.  I don’t recognize the name and so I asked him who he is and do I know him.  And he says no.  So I ask him how did he get my YIM and he says he’s an acquaintance of my friend Yvonne and he got my email from one of her emails.  And the red flags go up; I already know what this boy has on his mind. ( For those of you who know me, yes, I’m already rolling my eyes .)  So I ask this boy do you normally IM Yvonne’s friends? He says, no.  I’m thinking,  YEAH RIGHT .  Then I ask him how well he knows Yvonne and he says he doesn’t really know her.  I’m thinking,  whatta freak . So I ask him did he IM any other ppl from her email and he says a few.  And so I ask him what their responses were.  He says they were confused and disgruntled.  So I ask him, why he continues doing so.  DUH!   And I give him my 2 cents, don’t you think it’s a lil  ODD  you email ppl you  DON’T KNOW .  He says he just wants to my friends.  I told him he should have at least ask Yvonne for permission or let her introduce him to us.  So after I give the 411 how normal ppl act like, THEN ( of course after a nice session with me ), he says he’s going to apologize to Yvonne.    Afterwards, I catch Yvonne online, and ask her, who this freak is.  And she tells me she  BARELY  even knows the guy.  And how all her other friends were being bugged by this dude.  She later emails me the apology letter he emails her, and I noticed how he harasses only the friends of her those were girls.  Yeah right, you were  ONLY  looking for friends.  PUH-LEEZE ! Did he IM any of her guy friends? Nope. I should have messed around with this guy and said I would be a female after a few more surgeries. I wonder if he would still want to be my friend. ;p

      Whatta day.   Just came back from UCI.  Edwin and I were guest speakers on behalf of  urlLink MANAA  for a Korean American women class; we were invited to speak about media representations and stereotypes. Funny thing, as I was walking in, I recognized their professor, a fellow classmate of mine at UCLA. Small world.  Was hoping more energy from the class, a lil disappointed maybe because it was a 3 hour class and it was 8 at nite, that’s why most of the students were so dead, but then again it is UCI.  *sigh*  Though was refreshed by the students that stayed behind and talked with us some more. Was planning to promote Coffeehouse and other OCAPICA stuff, but most of the students, seem to scurry as soon as their Dennis released them. Someone needs to whack some reality into the UCI APIA student population.  But I’ll rant and rave about UCI’s Asian American Studies and APIA students another time.   Anywho, just before the lecture, I had a faboo dinner with my fellow BCL participants.  Audrey picked this YUMMY French and Vietnamese restaurant called  La Veranda .  It was sooooooooo good. I was so tempted on ditching the lecture, but I got a nice share of food before I had to jet.    But I’m pretty drained.  Tutoring today was pretty exhausting; there was a sub today, so when I got to Century, it was chaotic.  D would not focus, and the other students weren’t helping.  Then a fight broke out.  I really worry about D, I have not be able to get thru to him, why he needs to focus, he’s not going to be ready, when he goes to high school, at the rate, he’s going at, I’m so worried, he’s going to get so going to get so frustrated, he’ll drop out.  I hope tomorrow is better, but knowing that the sub is there til Tues. isn’t really reassuring.  Sometimes I wonder why some people become teachers I’ve meet so many unqualified subs.  I remember this one that tried to instigate something with the one of the students.  Hello, you’re supposed to be the more mature one?   Makes me soooo mad.    Now onto my weekend  Was in LA, most of this weekend, yes back at the House of Wang.  On the way to LA, I was still in OC on the 405 and I got a call on my cell and saw Jeremy's name appear on my caller id, I answer my cell and Jeremy is telling me he's in the next lane to me.  Too funny .  He recognized my UCLA and  urlLink Lenore  sticker.   Crazy.   We had a good laugh about it. Was going to LA to celebrate Pason and Alice’s birthday, as well as all the other January bday’s such as Raymond’s and Charlene’s.  Helped out Richard with the planning and what not.  Interesting all these ppl asked when the birthday people’s birthday was at, but did any of them really help plan? Nope. Hmmmm…makes you wonder what kinda friend they are or what their agenda is.  (Well, Jason and Bonnie don’t count since they helped out)  But you people know who you are.  Though what really annoyed me were the soooooooooo many maybe’s and the no shows.  It was so ridiculous how many maybe’s there were.  But J was mentioning, I should just assume the maybe’s weren’t coming, which was pretty much true.   But we still had a pretty nice turnout.   But man, looking for a place was pretty hard, thought  urlLink 360  would be perfect, but noooooooo, they’re STILL under construction, and it’s been over a year! So I mentioned to Rich,  urlLink Barbara’s at the Brewery , even though I’ve never tried it, I’ve been wanting to check it out, every time I go to the  urlLink Brewery .  Had a lil trouble finding it since Jason suggested I go local, and he nearly drove me loco ( yes, that was suppose to be funny ) anyhow, I was a lil stressed since we were behind on schedule and I didn’t know how to get their on the local streets and Jason was saying go this way, then this way.  Had a nice scenic tour of downtown LA and finally figured out where  urlLink San Antonio Winery  is at.  That's my next restaurant to check out. Luckily, we finally found it.  It was pretty cool since there was no one else there and it was really chill and cozy with couches.  I dug it.  Too bad the food wasn’t as good. Don’t get the deep fried catfish. It’s pretty bleah. Wish I had known there was no table service.  I didn’t mind but I should have found a place that offered that. Good place to kick back and lounge.  Rich found out from the bartender, there was a battle of the robots in one of the buildings.  And one of the robots had V8 engine! Insane.   But we had to get the Gate since we were on the list, and I didn’t want to deal with the whole velvet rope crapola we had to deal with at Las Palmas and I really didn’t want to pay cover for a place that plays  *ahem*   “hip-hop” for one of those fancy pancy places.  Edwin was telling how the Gate was such the thing 10 years ago and I mentioned how I was only 15 back then.   HAH!  Anyways, just barely got there before 10 and played the DD role since I didn’t want to drink, cuz I prayed waaaaaaaaaay too many times to the porcelain god last year and I don’t enjoy shivering and having ppl think I’m having a seizure cuz you know how attractive that is. Yes, I’m a cheap date but then again I seemed to be always doing all the paying….hey don’t mind me I only work for a non-profit.  CHEAP ASSES!  Uh, do I have issues? You would too if you had to deal with $#&@ I’ve gone out.  Okay, I’m going off on a tangent, back to story.  The Gate wasn’t too bad inside; the music was commercialized hip hop that was more R&B disguised as hip hop, in other words..eh okay.  Bonnie was harassed by 2 guys, SNL Roxbury guys’ style.  Nasty.  Then Alice friends’ Bonnie and Tracy got grab by some guys so I wasn’t in any mood to get on the dance floor to deal with slimy guys so I chilled with Naomi near the fireplace.  Was entertained by Thomas, who was drunk off his ass, being very loud, and telling us about his sex-capades or lack of.  Word to wise never spank or bite the dude.  No S&M for him ;p   Poor Pason got completely wasted.  Never saw the guy looked so bad from drinking.  Usually Pason has a pretty good tolerance, but most of been around 11:30ish, when I started to notice, he was looking pretty bad. Luckily Bonnie was looking out him, especially since he yakked on the table.   Eeps .  So Bonnie took him back home.  Most of the bday group had thinned out by the time we got to the Gate so it was just a handful of us left afterwards.  Well, I hope Pason and Alice had a good time.   The next day had an artery clogging but yummy lunch at Junior’s.  We ordered soup, chili cheese fries and potato pancakes, which were good.  Then went to buy some Superbowl snacks, since we had didn’t have our fill of junk food in our system.  Had more chili and nachos, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, Pringles’ Spicy Cajun, Arizona Green Tea, chocolate rugula from Juniors….healthy…no? Wait, I had some carrot sticks too. ;p  Had to bounce cuz Bonnie made plans to take Pason out to a gondola ride in LB, but we got lost and so were late, so the company were being assholes so they cancelled.  Luckily, they didn’t charge Bonnie.  So ate at Belmont Brewery Company ordered this tomato soup thing, the waitress suggested and it was horrible, waay too sweet and salty, the cerviche wasn’t too bad.  Watched the last quarter, it was pretty sad what happened to the Raiders the last 6 minutes, thought they had a chance, but then they got humiliated.  Was disappointed by the Superbowl commercials, I saw this year.  The Levi’s one was pretty sad and the AT&T’s mLife one was pretty uninventive.   Yawn .

      Check out  urlLink Tolerance.org  tomorrow, they'll be an article about Maxim's f* up article called "Maxim's Kick-Ass Workout" by Daniel Kraus, Illustrations by Steve Cross Pgs. 74, 76, 78. It was bought to their attention by OCAPICA. It's in Maxim's Feb. 2003 issue.   They have a computer generated illustration of a white guy kicking the crap out of Gandhi-like figure. They could have made the illustration look like so that you couldn't tell what ethnicity either person was, where both figures were generic figures.  They could have made the person white.  But noooooooooo.  They didn’t choose Martin Luther King Jr., someone who regarded Gandhi highly, they didn’t choose Jesus, another pacificist, they choose Gandhi, an Asian, a “safe target.”   Basically it implies that Asian men are weak, wimps and inferior, especially to white men.   This is really disturbing since post 9-11, many South Asians and those appearing to be Muslim were brutally attacked in hate crimes.    And what is Maxim saying about ppl that are opposed to the war?   But have no fear OCAPICA and MANAA and yours truly has something up their sleeves. TBA later.

         Image courtesy of the  urlLink Kristina Sheryl Wong  aka the  urlLink Big Bad Chinese Mama , herself.   8)  Woo hoo! I'm on a website, well Kristina's site. That’s right I’m special. ;p  BTW that's Charles, Pac Ties former biz manager. Buncha the Pac Ties staff from my gen had a nice Pac Ties reunion at Versailles, since Tam was visiting from San Jose for the weekend.  Michelle, Lindy, Jeremy, Kristina, Dave Lee, Stefanie and her bf John, Tam and her bf Ben, and Charles came on out.  Enjoyed playing catch up.  Afterwards, we went to check out Zanzibar. No cover on Sunday. 8)  I like I like , nice chill lounge place and good music, a  urlLink KCRW  vibe, well what can you expect Garth Trinidad spins that nite.  I especially liked how they played some Brazilian tracks, they mixed a Suba track in as well. It's tragic what happened to him though. Would have been better, if they played some Marisa Monte tracks, like from her new album.   Had to leave early since I was staying at the House of Wang and didn’t want to my lovely host to stay up late.

"tacl: a face only a mother could love"  haha..just kidding..the boys and girls are hot.  staff?  still ugly.  come on out for 4 days, 3 nights of snow, skiing (or snowboarding, if you're into that hippie crap), and good clean [smirk] entertainment.  at the very least, you'll learn to write your name in the snow.  even you girls.  :D ----------- That's right go to TACL Winter Camp 2003.   urlLink http://youth.tacl.org   I LOVE MY TAIWANESE PEOPLE! Next time I'll share the conversations I've been having with our lil Juliet, who will be turning 18 next month. AUGH.  She wants to adopt a mini-leaguer.  8O

      Woo hoo hoo! Found the new Julie Plug website.   urlLink www.julieplug.net   New album March 2, 2003! It's about time. Guess they're under Thud Rumble, I hope they do a better job promoting JP. It would be a shame to see such a great and talented group go to waste.   Another overdue album I'm waiting for is  urlLink Amel Larrieux's  Bravebird.  I LOOOOOOOOVE the Brave Bird song. Supposedly her album is coming out in March as well.  I hope it doesn't get pushed back.   And there's a new Marisa Monte album. 8) Someone want to buy me it? It's at Amoeba's.    Hmmm....jen's listening to a lot of music.   Guess what that means? =====   Updates :  (well I'll be doing this backward or something like that)   Thurs. Jan. 9th   Meet up with Rosa to go to Carol aka  urlLink DJ Careroll’s  birthday party at  THE MIX @ 2nd Street Jazz  in Little Tokyo.  Carol’s one of the resident DJs there, so be sure to check her out every Thursday nite, as well as the other  urlLink Joint One  DJs.   I would have never known that such a place like that was there.  Doors open @ 8pm and there’s no cover for you po’ folks.     2nd Street Jazz 366 E. 2nd Street Los Angeles, CA 90012 213.680.3232  A blend of Old School Funk & Soul,  Hip-Hop, R & B, Reggae/Dancehall  In a lounging atmosphere  I ordered some buffalo wings and boy was that a sight.  I was so ladylike.  HAH!  I inhaled those suckers.  Thank gawd, it was dim in there. ;p Pretty nice place, though wish the bartender knew how to mix more drinks, wanted to get Carol a Blowjob or Sex on the Beach but she didn’t know how to make any of those drinks. Ah well, so got her an apple martini.  Carol was a riot on the dance floor. She’s the best. 8) Her fellow mariachi band members were a fun bunch as well. We’re busting out corny dance moves from back in the days.  The sprinkler move, card dealer and the U-turn. 8D  hehe     Mariachi Band?! Yes, I did say mariachi band.  That’s right Carol’s in a mariachi band. She’s playing the violin, which BTW she just learned how to play a couple of weeks ago; yes that girl is too talented.  So be sure to check the  Mariachi Toros  from CSUDH.    Ran into Jenny H. and Louise from TACL.  Nazareth aka DJ Rhettmatic from the  urlLink WORLD FAMOUS BEAT JUNKIES  also came out and even got on the drums with DJ Peepshow’s group Just Homies.  He even gave Carol some records. That’s what I admire of Nazareth, even though I don’t know him personally, he’s always been nice to me and approachable, unlike some musicians I meet. I don’t seem to sense any ego and he’s really supportive of other djs. These are the types of artists I like and enjoy supporting.  Every time I see him in public, youth and other DJs go up to talk to him and admire him with such respect and awe.     I stayed til closing cuz Rosa suggested that I drive George aka DJ G-Force’s car, since he was pretty faded since it was his birthday party as well.   I made a sad attempt to park his car at Rosa’s place.  But got to know George a bit and found out he’s from OC too.   A but overall a fun and de-stressing nite, it was good to catch up with Rosa, hadn’t seen that girl forever.

      Should be packing for the TACL CORe event.  But I need to relax for a bit.  It’s been a crazy day.  Need to breathe and clear my head for a bit.  Was typing away and getting advice from Jason for my presentation tomorrow. Didn’t get to leave the office til almost 8.   Had a lunch date with Long, since I owed the “butch boy” ( cha you wish I’m more butch than you ) a meal.  Went to La Veranda cuz I wanted to check out their lunch special, which they didn’t have much of, only items which you find at most Asian cafes, but it was good nonetheless.  Afterwards, we were suffering major food coma.    By the time I got back, the office building maintenance was FINALLY fixing our leaky roof, well only the ceiling, the roof will be fixed HOPEFULLY soon after.  Most of our staff was out either at meetings or with their significant others. My co-worker Diep was gone to New York, a gift from her new boyfriend.  HOW NICE IS THAT? LUCKY!   My suspicions that Alice's fiancée was getting her flowers were true, when I got to the office there were a dozed red long stemmed roses.  I had a hunch since he asked me for our office’s building address the day before.  The funny thing was that Alice hadn’t gotten him a present yet so I helped her printed photos with new NICE HP printer.  Unfortunately, for some strange reason the print would be canceled, so I would have restart and the print would work but then I wouldn’t have any web access so I would have to restart again.  FUN FUN FUN!   Luckily, Alice made her present just in time. Though the rest of the staff, including myself, teased her about it.   heh heh.  Our intern Young was telling us how it was insane out there, people couldn’t find anymore Valentine cards, there were long lines at chocolate stores and when he went to the Century City, yesterday, there was a long ass line out of Tiffany’s.  haha .  It’s things like these that make me feel good to me single.>8D  EVIL, that I am.

      Geez how sad am I?  ( Don’t answer that ) I’m typing up user reviews for  urlLink Citysearch  like a mad woman.  I should get paid for this because my opinion is important.  ( Okay, you can stop laughing.........NOW ) Anyways, I was looking at the previous reviews I had posted up there and I had so many typos and grammatical errors.  ( yeah yeah I know that’s not new news ) Yes, me english good.   Man, my sinuses are killing me, I just want to rip them right out. ARRGH. I can just feel the headache coming.  Whatta day, I was sitting down having dinner with my family and my grandpa looks at me and says in Taiwanese “Aren’t you married?” My mom is cracking up and jokes around with my grandpa telling him that if I were, I would be at my own house, if I were married and he replies in Taiwanese, “Well, just because she’s married she doesn’t just have to eat at her own house, she can also come over.”    Aiyo!  Welcome to my family.  I guess this beats having my grandpa telling me I’m starting to get old and how I should start looking for a boyfriend before I start turning ugly because then I won’t be able to find a husband then.  Just another wacky nite at the Kuo’s

      Been feeling down lately.  Wasn’t in the mood to go to the City of Sin with the gang this weekend and on top of that I was pooped out from this past week.  Pretty much brain dead at work on Friday.  Then my old cell fell into the toilet at work cuz the freakin’ stalls are so small and I had to bring in my bag cuz Aunt Flo is visiting.   Yeah, I’m having a f* great day . Thank gawd, it was a fresh bowl cuz you know how I feel about these office building restrooms. ( Read my previous rant somewhere here )   So instead of feeling sorry for myself at home, I thought would get outta the house, Audrey B. had told me of a craft store called  urlLink Tall Mouse  and I found out they had a store in Irvine.  The place rocks!  I LOVE going to art and craft stores.  Wanted to get more glass beads for the beaded flowers I’m getting addicted in making. I WANT ALL THE COLORS!!!!!!!! MUAHAHAHAHA. They had all these pretty wires as well, that came in all different colors. If I had the time, I would love to learn how to make jewelry.  Typically, I don’t wear jewelry cuz 1) they tend to be expensive 2) they leap off my 3) fat fingers and 4) I don’t know jack about the Cs, carat, clarity…..errrrr? Someone could give me Cracker Jack ring and I wouldn’t know better.    Wanted to buy some polymer clay but thought I should pace myself and I should check out other craft store prices.  Some of Tall Mouse’s items were a lil bit more expensive than other places I’ve been too.  Though compare to  urlLink Michael’s  they have a bigger selection.  One side of the room had all these acrylic paints, I didn’t look too long because I didn’t want to tempt myself. And I also want to start decorating glass, they have this cool paint that air drys and is microwaveable and all that good stuff.    Afterwards went to  urlLink Barnes & Nobles  to see if I could find any decent books on bead weaving but I couldn’t find any, but I completely lost myself in their other art and craft books.  Hopefully this will take my mind off of the craziness that’s going on with the world and the blahness of my non-existent love life.  Yes, we’re BACK on that subject, which I’m failing miserably in, especially in the participation area.  I’ve noticed when Aunt Flo is here, I tend to a get a lil bit more down easily, and so I try and check myself. Just been tough lately being that all my close friends aren’t within driving distances, like they’re literally in another state, and the other ones have significant others.  Don’t really have anyone to rant and rave to.  I guess thank gawd for BLOGS.  Just so sick of dealing with shallow guys, remember those days in PE, where there were 2 team captains and they would choose who they would want on their team.  I totally know what it’s like to be picked last or not being chosen at all. Yeah, yeah I’m being a drama queen, where’s the violins? But shoot, since I don’t drink, smoke or do drugs, this is how I deal with this. Maybe, I should join the NRA or something.  I’M KIDDING!    But this site  urlLink http://nickname.has-a-small-penis.com , did make me feel a lil better, was reading  urlLink URB  and saw this as one of their links. So if you know some jerk, just type in their name or nickname in that area.  And then  Viola ! But man those pics did remind me of some ppl....... Yes, I’m Evil . And yes, I’m feeling a lil better >8) ( note: I don’t hate all men, there are some decent ones but they’re all hooked up .)

       Now back to our scheduled program……………..   Sat. Feb. 1  Spoke at UCI’s 18th annual  urlLink Asian Pacific American Awareness Conference (APAAC)  on the behalf of MANAA.  Had to improvise a bit since Edwin’s car was having problems and he had the MANAA video.  And I had planned the workshop with the video in the beginning and I was under the impression there would be more MANAA members, so I had to stall.  On the workshop I would only give myself a 7 and I’m being generous.  I couldn’t believe what Edwin said in our workshop.  But we had a bunch students stay afterwards and talk.  Meet some cool people from SDSU.  So I guess we weren’t too bad. Afterwards had to clear the air with one of the students due to a misunderstanding, but was glad he approached us about it, then let it go.  Dialogue is good and too often doesn’t happen enough in real life.   It’s weird now that I’m older, I know more speakers, than students.  Well, I did help John with getting a couple of the speakers' contact info.  Ran into Shazeen, Manjuri, Dennis, and as well Sunny, who was back from China. Hopefully she’ll kick some sense into these UCI students.     Tues. Feb. 7  Was invited to speak at UCLA’s Thien Minh Ly’s commemoration at the last minute. Meg had given one of the organizers my contact info.  Was wondering why they didn’t contact  urlLink APALC  but I found out thru Dennis, they had also contacted him at the last minute too and he couldn’t.  Traffic on the 405 wasn’t too bad, so I was happy.   Man, Westwood and UCLA has changed a bit.  BTW I am so outta shape, was walking to Kerckhoff from behind Ackerman and those steps killed me. Probably would have been worse, if I hadn’t been going to the gym.  Anyways, ran into Jenni, had a nice lil chat with her, she was giving a spoken word piece at the end. That girl, is still such a sweetie.  Also found out that they had also invited one of Thien Minh Ly’s friend Mai Pham, who was very active and helped get the word out about Thien Minh Ly’s death to the UCLA campus since the Daily bRUIN didn’t do their job. It was great meeting her; I hope I never lose someone close to me like she did because it still hurts for her. Found out the Thien’s family still lives in the same house in Tustin and that his sister and her husband are stationed in Kuwait. So please pray for that family since they’ve gone thru enough tragedy.  I think I did a better job giving a presentation this time than UCI, though I wonder if I was too aggressive. Found out one of the organizers was ALSO a classmate of mines, can’t remember what class though.  Got to meet the rest of the  urlLink VSU  staff, great bunch.  Also ran into Kim To, as well as someone that knew of OCAPICA thru Shawn.

      Oh, before I go onto the rest of my updates.  I’M REALLY ANNOYED by the Asian American Studies community sometimes and how they treat Taiwanese Americans, like we aren’t legit. WHAT THE FUCK! I’m so sick how they marginalized some groups or are very selective what groups are featured.  I deal with waaay too much bullshit. Don’t tell me what Asian American Studies is, all you hypocrites that tote power thru self-determination, I define who I am.   Something else that’s also been annoying me is the lack of protest from the APIA community for the Maxim article.  Besides OCAPICA, MANAA, ACON and few other APIA groups and of course the South Asian community, I haven’t seen much response like Yao Ming and Shaq deal.   Grrrrrrr.   But I’m not done with Maxim yet, advertisers watch out, when Jen’s pissed off, I get shit done.

        Updates updates:     Friday, Jan. 31  Restarted  urlLink OCAPICA  Youth Coffeehouse for the year, I had been looking for a new location since the Garden Grove Boys & Girls Club Family site was going to be unavailable to us for awhile.  Tried to hook something up at the  urlLink Grand Central Art Center , but I decided not to since we would have to pay for someone to close, even though insiders in CSUF, tell me CSUF has the budget to pay for something like that. But I’m going to keep the location for future special events because I love  urlLink Santa Ana’s Artists Village .  So we had Coffeehouse at the OC Youth Drop-In Center. ( Mucho grassy asses to Rick )    Didn’t know what the turnout was going to be since I was a dork and planned Coffeehouse on Lunar New Year’s Eve ( Doh! Come on not all API youth celebrate Lunar New Year ). Then, being that we hadn’t had a Coffeehouse since August and we were having it at a new location probably didn’t help and on top of that one of youth organizers had a family emergency so couldn’t attend.   So I was a lil stressing especially since I was pretty much the only staff running the show. With the help of our youth volunteers quickly and may I say creatively, made signs from leftover fliers to create an arrow pointing where the Youth Drop-In Center was since you need to buzz in to enter.   If you’ve been, you know what I mean.  Anyways, only a handful of youth came out, mostly college students were in attendance.  I was impressed that Paul and his friend came out.  It’s nice to know people that keep their word when they say, they’re going to come and do.  Sorry, I’ve meet waaaaaay too many flakes this past year. But then again Paul seems like a man of character.  He really got kicked out of our Got Ballz men’s health flier.   Rhianne and her group performed a spoken word piece and song, as did Shawn’s friends; he meet at the F.O.B. exhibit, one of them was a classmate of mines at UCLA.  ( Yes, small world ) C also performed a powerful and personal spoken word piece about her experience about rape, which I had no idea about.    We had a lively discussion about rape to politics to homelessness; I know I learned something that night.  Was glad I wasn’t really facilitator since it’s easier for me to have a more objective perspective.  It’s really hard for me to mc sometimes since some issues are so personal to me; I get too often on my soapbox. ;p So in some sense I was in a way a facilitator since I could step out of the picture and I could see how I can be like when I get on soapbox. ;p   One thing that irked me a bit was when one guy said he wasn’t political and ( yes, I’m getting on my soapbox and I can cuz it’s my DAMM BLOG  ;p) I get really annoyed when I hear people say this, especially I noticed so many API say this, don’t you people understand it’s your civic duty and it’s privileged to be whatever it means be “political”.  (I swear the next person that says this I’m going to call them out on it and ask them what do you mean by being “political.”) People have fought so hard and died not to realize they were doing it for such an apathetic group. It’s people like this that let our society go to hell, this is why f* idiots run our county, as well as our country.  You doing nothing is doing something.   ARRRGH .  Gotta say my piece.

      A lot has happen since CORe.  Was either too busy, lazy or blogger was down so I couldn’t update.  Will update one day, said the queen of procrastination. But currently in pain, tummy ache. I will spare you from details but SO NOT FUN! Wanted to put up this email, I just got today.  It’s about a former classmate of mines.  Really nice guy.  Kristina’s the best. This girl never lacks creativity. Read below.     Hello Friends!  So ok, the change is not for me.  But I am writing to request a dime or two for great reason!  Some of you know that I recently got a small fellowship from Visual Communications to shoot my first short documentary.  The intended subject is my friend Larry who recently graduated from UCLA but finds himself in the unfortunate position of having no car and being 40k in debt from loans, credit cards and basically not being born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Believe me, he's not like the woman from savekaryn.com who got into debt from buying too many Prada bags.  The debt combined with lack of car creates a slippery slope for Larry who can't really go after too many dreams when he needs to survive day-to-day.  For a few months I chronicled Larry selling things on Ebay to work himself out of this debt and overcome the "machine" that was keeping him down, but well, it just hasn't been all that interesting, and he's only made about $400 for pawning off his childhood memories.  A small drop in a massively big bucket.  So Larry had this idea that he would outrun a bus.  A bus is the slow burdening unreliable metaphor of a machine that Larry's existence has been so depressingly dependent on.  He wants to outrun it to prove that he's tougher than his situation and can beat his odds.  So we are staging a  "BEAT THE BUS" race so Larry can prove to himself and the world that victory is not impossible.  You can read all about this race at  urlLink http://www.helpsavelarry.com  For me, it's a real human story of one man's will to fight for his humanity. And it will be the crux of the documentary.  I want Larry to succeed.  We've already gotten attention from a local community newspaper, the Rafu, who will do some coverage on the event.  On the site you can sponsor Larry and leave him a message to promote your own site, events, group, whatever.  A great chance for cheap advertising. Starting at 1 cent!  Larry will also do the race wearing a shirt with all the names of his sponsors on it.  Sort of like how Indy Race cards are covered in logos.  The bigger the sponsorship amount, the bigger your name appears on his shirt! Like a moving billboard!  Donations can be as low as one penny and as high as the moon, so I hope you will support Larry as he fights for humankind.  Thanks for your support!

      Fuck, why do I tolerate and allow myself to be treated like shit by ppl? Why do I continue to care about ppl that never really cared about me? Why don't I learn? Why am I so foolish? Where are all the decent ppl in this world? Yesterday was hell and I had to go thru it 3 different times. I don't even know where to start. FUCK LOVE. I'm so tired. So tired about being used.  So tired about being forgotten. So tired of being the understanding one but not being understood.  So tired of lending an ear but not being listen to.  So tired of remembering ppl's birthdays but them never remembering mines.  So tired of broken and empty promises.  So tired of always being there for ppl but ppl not being there for me. So tired of not being the one.  I'm just so tired.   I don't know how I'm going to have the energy to go to work today or present tomorrow. I'm pretty much a basketcase right now.

      Yes, my blog is turning into my bitching journal. ( Yeah, yeah I should be more positive…blah blah)  It sucks, always hearing about all these great things either my guys friends do for their girlfriends or hearing about my friends and their amazing boyfriends.  Surprising them with a getaway weekend trip, making them dinner, getting them wonderful, thoughtful gifts, or making them a desk with their own two hands...I’m so jealous.  GRRRRRR….man, I’m soooo bitter.   Why can’t I just accepted the fact that I’m doomed to be single?    I need to promise myself, that I’ll go to Sao Paulo, SOON!!!  Meet me some sexy Asian Brazilian man.  Need to have some fun in my life; I’ll be my own stinkin’ significant other.   Hmmm…I think I can squeeze out another personality…..  ;p

Shoot, all the pics I can find are of freakin' Tom Cruise. BOO!!!! Though the Japanese  urlLink Last Samurai  website was a bit better had some of Kensaku. Actually, I like their website better.

      Aaaargh, it's my day off/comp day and I spent it all day by working on  urlLink MANAA  stuff.   I need a vacation.  So it's Friday and here I am waiting for some stinkin' reporter to call me back so he can interview me about The Last Samurai and how MANAA feels.    BTW I actually enjoyed  urlLink The Last Samurai .  Yes, there are things that could have been better and there wasn't a need for Tom Cruise, it would have been fine with just Ken Watanabe IMHO.  But I know I'm being biased.  Look why....     Ken Watanabe KICKS ASS!!!!! HE IS THE LAST SAMURAI! NOW THAT'S A MAN!!!!! Woo hoo! SCHWING. HOMINA HOMINA! Isn't he just deee-licious? Pardon the drool. 8)..... Now to find a younger version and single version.   Wonder if he has a little brother?  A girl can dream.... Yes, I'm hormonal,  it's being a while and sadly I have a hunch it's going to be another looooooooong drought. Wait, I don't know what rain is like..... *sigh*  Damm you cruel, cruel world.   (waves fist in air)   Yes, jen is going off on terminally single status, yet again.  This is my BLOG and I can rant and rave if I wanna.  And I'm sure listening to Stevie Wonder's  Ribbon in the Sky  isn't helping. (It's such a wonderful song would love to have someone to cuddle and snuggle with when listening to this song or to slow dance to it) . Geez, I'm depressing myself.  Need more pics of Mr. Watanabe.  ;p Yes, I need help.  But at least I know what or should I say who I want for Christmas.

      Woo hoo!  I'm sooo glad I went shopping today.  Going thru all that madness of after Christmas shopping was worth it becuz the Sam Goody at South Coast Plaza was closing so everything was 60%-85% off.  The store was pretty barren when I got there.  So I didn't think I would find much, but because ppl in Orange County don't know good music when they see it, I grabbed the last of the good ones.   HAH!  ( Yes, I'm doing my happy dance ) I was so happy everyone else in the store was looking for pop stuff, cuz that left all the goodies for me.  ( I couldn't help but laugh when ppl around me were saying "all the good stuff is gone"   FOOLS! ), I can't believe the deal I got.   SO HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.    This is what I found: - urlLink Tribalistas  DVD (I LOOOOVE MARISA MONTE, can't believe the Latin Grammys had them close the show and didn't even show their entire performance. BOO!) - urlLink Jean Grae   The Bootleg of The Bootleg EP  (Got to support female emcees especially DOPE ones that represent females and gotta give love to  urlLink babygrande , though they should have done a better job promoting the last MB album) - urlLink Spooks   Faster Than You Know  (Like the track Chali 2NA is on and Ming Xia has awesome voice, actually she's the only reason why I listen to that group, their rhyming and delivery skill still need improving) - urlLink Ani DiFranco   Not a Pretty Girl  (Ah, the original 32 Flavors) - urlLink Ledisi   Soulsinger  (saw her when I went to see Arrested Development at HOB and she was great and she knew how to work a crowd) - urlLink The Incredible Moses Leroy   become The Soft.Lightes  (never heard of him but I'm digging his stuff he does sound a little like Michael Jackson and I love how Miho Hatori from Cibo Matto makes a guest appearance.)    YES!!! My digging skills have improved. Good music makes jen happy. 8)

      Just had dinner with one of my maternal grandaunts, who just came from Taiwan to visit and found out that two of her relatives are well know fortune tellers/psychics.  My mom was telling me that the elderly woman is often asked for advice and is always traveling.  Just recently the KMT/Blue Party asked her of their chances in the upcoming election and she told them not to spend a lot of money because they're not going to win. HAHA!    Her apprentice was later telling my cousin Alice and I about ourselves.  He was telling me that he got the impression that I'm much more independent and free willed and spirited.  Then he talked about my love life and he said to the effect that I wouldn't get as easily married as Alice.  For her it would be much easier but not me. (Which is pretty true cuz she's always been much more successful in dating and what not than I've been, I've yet to be in a serious relationship.) He basically said he couldn't see anything in my future yet.  At first I thought, "Come on give me some kinda hope, Jen needs some luvin," and then I was talking to my mom later and she said, it might have been because he didn't want to say.  So paranoid me is thinking, "Greeeat, he's probably didn't want to tell me that it sucks to be me, and how I'm never going to find love." BLEAH!  Well, I hope it's not the later. But then again, I'm still young and I can always change my future.  But it would have been nice to know that there is some hope for me yet in 2004.

      Dope.  Was reading  urlLink OC Weekly  over the break and was reading the music reviews and I noticed that one of the  urlLink local artists  being reviewed look like this dude I went to high school with.   The way they described him it sounded like the same guy I knew in high school.  Brook was a cool guy in high school, a down to earth guy that was nice to pretty much everyone, in a real genuine and sincere way, not fake at all.    So it turns out it's the same Brook I knew in high school.  Plan to check him out at Gypsy Den in Costa Mesa later this month.  Check Brook out at  urlLink www.brookleemusic.com

      Gosh, I really can’t stand ppl that can’t follow and READ DIRECTIONS, especially when it’s right in front of their face and then they get mad or make demands.  HELLO, DUMBASS, maybe if you actually read the directions or paid attention, you wouldn’t be in that predicament.  And to top it off volunteers that expect more money.  Uh it’s nice enough; we’re giving you some sort of stipend.  We’re a non-profit here; we’re not rolling in money.  GRRRRRRRR.  And not only that they waste my time for nothing. Arrgh.  And don’t you hate it when people tell you to call them back, but their phone lines keep ringing and ringing cuz either they’re online or don’t have vm.  Or don’t you hate it when ppl want you to email them back but when you do their email bounces back cuz their email box is full and then they get mad at you for not getting back to them, when you would if you could.  Yes, it’s one of those days.

      What a day.  So much to do at least I was productive, but now I'm pooped and just wanna veg. Ugh! TV Good! But there's still SOOOOO MUCH to do.  Preparing for the upcoming primary election with the new eSlate system, financial aid workshop, and other various programs. Needed a break from the madness.  So I'm typing in my blog.   It's freakin' February already.  *Sheesh*  Anyhow, random subject, was making Tomato, Mozzarella and Basil Salad for an early lunch today.   mmmmmm  Sauteed some garlic in olive oil and topped it off with balsamic vinegar.  YUMMY!!! And I was realizing when I was eating, I used to be such a picky eater as a kid, I never like eating tomatoes raw and now I love eating them and I know I would have never enjoyed eating basil or balsamic vinegar as a kid but now it's so good.  I really do LOVE FOOD.  It's the only way for me to get any oral pleasures, cuz I ain't getting any of the other kind. ;p   That reminds me I really need to go to the gym.  It's been over 2 months already but since I've been so busy and also very LAZY I haven't gone.  And it's not getting pretty.  Think rolls, inner tube, love handles galore. Dark colors are my friend.  Woo hoo!  jiggle jiggle jiggle

      Yes, I'm quoted again.   I'm so vain......  Doggone it why not? I have no life, might as well enjoy what I got. ;p    urlLink No to ‘Yes, Dear’  Comedy under fire for racist slur  By Sam Chu Lin, Special to  urlLink AsianWeek , Mar 19, 2004   Emmy Award-winning news cameraman Kristopher Li was relaxing with his family last week, watching Yes, Dear, when he was jolted from his seat.  It wasn’t an earthquake or sudden health emergency, but rather the word “chinaman” that spurred Li to action.  The character responsible for uttering the slur was that of veteran actress Vicki Lawrence in the March 1 Yes, Dear episode, “Owner’s Suite.”  Character 1: Hey, you guys are going to have a blast at the basketball game. Character 2 (Vicki Lawrence): Now are the Lakers the team that have that giant china - man? Character 1: No - that’s Yao-Ming! He’s on the Rockets. But the Lakers have their own giant — Shaquille O’Neal.  Seeing the shocked look on his 13-year-old son’s face, Li knew he had to do something.  When Li’s friend who works at a local radio station invited him to go on the air to talk about the episode and its potential impact, he gladly accepted.  And he’s calling on others in the Asian Pacific American community to let their feelings be known.  “A lot of people including mainstream Americans and some [APAs] don’t even know that ‘chinaman’ is offensive,” Li says. “If the network apologizes, then more people will realize this is a word that should not be used.”  Various APA organizations have issued statements, ranging from irate to moderately concerned. But so far, CBS network executives haven’t responded let alone apologized.  The  urlLink Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) , a watchdog organization monitoring the networks and movie studios, has sent a letter of protest to CBS and demanded an apology.   Jennifer Kuo,  president of MANAA, says the organization had given the network a list of Asian terms to avoid — including “chinaman” — because of their racial overtones.  “It’s frustrating when something like this happens,” she says. “We’ve sat down with CBS executives to talk about this. We’ve tried to help them out, but it looks like they’re ignoring us. Why do we give them all of these things if they’re not going to read it?”  Shortly after the episode ran, Karen Narasaki, head of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium in Washington, D.C., called the show’s producers, Greg Garcia and Alan Kirschenbaum.  She says, “They told me they were trying to portray an insensitive, out-of-touch woman.”  She adds, “I told them they should have included people reacting to her comments to make that point, and they agreed.  “They say they will take out the scene before that episode is re-run, and I think that’s good. It’s an education process.”  S.B. Woo, president of 80-20, an APA political activist group, says, “Since they’ve decided to cut out the scene, I’m only moderately satisfied.  “The show, itself, is not really that important. The fact they have ignored the racial slur is more important. I’m willing to give CBS another chance, but if there is a next time, we’ll really go to war!”  John Tateishi, executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, is angry that the producers and the network have given only a limited response. He believes a slur on one APA group is a slur on all APAs.  “Mainstream America can’t distinguish between the different ethnicities in the Asian communities,” he says. “So what is directed to one group certainly isn’t limited to that one group in the minds of the people who make such stupid comments.”

      GO DAIWAN LANG!!!! And I'm quoted. Woo hoo!  Guess the fortune teller was right. ( read previous post ) AHAHAHAHA.   ==================== Saturday, March 20, 2004   urlLink O.C. Taiwanese affected by attack   The assassination attempt on the island's president raises concern here.   By PATRICK VUONG   urlLink The Orange County Register     Some voters casting ballots today in the presidential election in Taiwan actually call Orange County home.   Despite living eight time zones away from the island, these Taiwanese Americans maintain dual citizenship and have flown back to the island to vote in the election, which was marred by an assassination attempt on the president and vice president Friday.  "My heart and love is in Taiwan right now," said Sarah Lobin, a Huntington Beach real estate agent.  The 51-year-old Taiwanese native did not return to Taiwan but said many of her clients and friends stay politically active in the country. Lobin hopes President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu will be re-elected to stand up against China, which sees Taiwan as one of its territories.  Chen has been vocal about forging a separate identity for Taiwan despite China's threats of attack if the island seeks independence.   "We're not afraid of China. We're very strong," Lobin said.  The shootings might help Chen's re-election, said Dorothy J. Solinger, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine.  "The assassination attempt will cause people to sympathize with him, especially among people who hadn't decided to vote yet or who weren't planning to vote for him," Solinger said. "It'll give a sense of empowerment to Chen because he feels he's fighting for a just cause."  Chen's political stance has attracted a following among Orange County's roughly 10,000 Taiwanese Americans, some of whom have been influential in his campaigns.  Fountain Valley aerospace engineer Ching Kuo, who is in Taiwan now, led a contingent of 16 U.S. businessmen to help Chen's first campaign in 2000. That same year, Lu raised $1.2 million during a Southern California visit.   Jennifer Kuo,  a member of the nonprofit  urlLink Taiwanese American Citizens League , said her relatives and friends have returned to their homeland to vote.  "This is a country that does see the value in voting," said Kuo, 26, of Costa Mesa. "I hope this (assassination attempt) doesn't intimidate anyone."  Irvine resident Ching F. Tsai agreed, saying he hopes the attack reinforces democracy in Taiwan.  "We hope people can learn a lesson and condemn this kind of violence," said Tsai, 55. "People should use the ballot instead of bullets."   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTACT US: (714) 445-6685 or pvuong@ocregister.com

      Listening to old school Taiwanese pop song clips.  (Funny, I don't really care for A-pop but I like the old school pop stuff, probably cuz I grew up listening to them, especially Teresa Teng was one of my family's favorite.)  I've always had a preference for songs in Taiwanese as a opposed to Mandarin, I'm thinking it was because I grew up speaking Taiwanese first than English.  Too bad I suck speaking Taiwanese now.  Anyhow...I can definitely hear the Japanese influence in the songs.  Most of the songs seem to be about sad, tragic love songs.  Maybe that's why I like listening to them so much.  *sigh*  (Someone should do a movie on these artists, if they haven't done so already, it would be a GREAT story.)    Does anyone know of any good stores here in SoCal or good websites that sell good Taiwanese albums?  (And yes, I'm still pissed cuz my bro rebooted my computer without backing up any of my info, which included all my MP3s, many which included all these Taiwanese songs. GRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!)    But I'm looking for albums that are sung in Taiwanese, usually the old school pop stuff or folk songs though I'm always to open to remakes by current artists, though I've been reading there's more artists in Taiwan that are singing in Taiwanese and there's a growing underground and independent music scene and I'm curious if Taiwan's music scene is getting better cuz I'm not into the saccharine pop music.   I'm also trying to collect some indigenous Taiwanese music.

       urlLink http://www.idealpartner.org.uk/ipbi/WhatJob.asp  Pretty interesting, a lot of what it said about me is true.  ------------------------------------------ Ki System   Natal Year number:  5  Although Jennifer at heart suffers from a sense of insecurity, she nevertheless portrays a confident yet sympathetic exterior to the outside world that enables her to get along well with other people.  Indeed even though she is not really a team player, she is likely to reach a position of authority because she enjoys the strength of independent thought upon which others can rely.   Natal Month number:  8  Tenacious and stubborn, Jennifer is someone who works slowly and methodically to achieve success.  Not the sort of individual to turn the world on fire, Jennifer is nonetheless a thoroughly reliable person whose careful approach to life brings steady reward.  She is something of a perfectionist who can be counted upon to complete tasks without supervision.   Natal House number:  2  Believing in her own abilities, Jennifer's attention to detail will lead her to success through hard work and her own unaided efforts.  She can however work well as a member of a team even though she will rarely, if ever, delegate responsibility without stringent conditions.   Comments based on Western Grid      11        Jennifer is a balanced individual who can understand and appreciate the views of others as well as her own.  She can express herself fluently, and with persuasive conviction, whilst taking account of opposing views.  This means that Jennifer will get on very well with colleagues at work, both senior and junior, as well as clients, customers, suppliers and external agencies.       66        Creative, Jennifer worries unnecessarily about home and family.  Over-protective, whilst enjoying parenthood she will prevent her own children from exercising their independence.  As a creative individual, Jennifer enjoys beautiful things, objets d'art and antiques to the extent that dealing with such objects offer her a very suitable form of employment.       77        With an analytical mind, in time Jennifer will come to understand the cause of losses she has suffered, and will then take an interest in the psychic world.  If too many things go wrong, and too many losses are sustained, Jennifer may well take more than a passing interest in astrology.  However, Jennifer has an excellent analytical mind which enables her to provide solutions to intricate problems.       9        Ambitious to improve her lot, Jennifer will constantly push forward to achieve something in her life, yet this ambition will be balanced by humanitarian ideals that will lead her to support causes that may demand self-sacrifice.   [The Arrow of Emotional Sensitivity: lacking the numbers 2, 5 and 8]   Acutely sensitive, Jennifer is easily hurt and as a consequence has learnt to hide her feelings.  Likely to suffer from an inferiority complex, she is very supportive of others who need her help.  Consequently Jennifer is best employed helping others, and in such an environment, she will shine.   Comments based on Chinese Grid      1        Jennifer will make some money and enjoy a reasonable standard of living.       3        Unless Jennifer also has in the Chinese version either the numbers 5 and 7, or the numbers 4 and 8, she will be hypersensitive and prone to stress-related problems.       4        Intelligent and logical, Jennifer is not someone who acts rashly on the spur of the moment.       77        Although Jennifer has spiritual leanings, she prefers the ceremony of religion to the faith that underpins it.  With 3 ones (in the Chinese version) Jennifer will also be blessed with good luck.       9        Although Jennifer is ambitious, her ambition is tempered with humanitarian ideals.   [The Arrow of Frustration: Lacking the numbers 2, 5 and 8]   Jennifer will be frustrated by events over which she seems to have little or no control.  Failure can be avoided if she thinks carefully before acting.

      Fellow community members,  Many of my friends knew both Kenny and the Chiu family and I sat in on this trial and have gotten to know the Chiu family so this issue is very close to my heart. Let's hope it doesn't die in the Senate. Too often hate crime bills never make it.    If you can, please sign on. You don't even have to be part of an organization to sign on.  It's actually pretty simple to sign on and doesn't take much time but will make tremendous impact.  If you don't get the attachments [there's four word documents 1) Fact Sheet 2)Support Letter Template 3)Endorsement form 4)Supporting orgs], feel free to contact me or Gloria Lin from Assemblymember Judy Chu's office for the template.    Let's give the Chiu family some form of justice. So please pass the word. Thanks.

You must act. -Dali Lama   -----Original Message----- From: Lin, Gloria [mailto:Gloria.Lin@asm.ca.gov]  Sent: Tuesday, May 18, 2004 5:58 PM To: Lin, Gloria Cc: Chan, Rosaline; 'dhuang@apalc.org' Subject: AB 2428 Kenny's Law - NEW LEGISLATION PROTECTING HATE CRIME VICTI MS  Dear Hate Crime Prevention Activists,   Assemblymember Judy Chu has proposed AB 2428 this session.  Of the bills she is carrying, she is most proud of AB 2428 which will be known as "Kenny's Law."  AB 2428 is named after Kenny Chiu, a 17 year old Taiwanese American boy that was brutally murdered simply because he was Asian.  In July 2001, Christopher Hearn, Kenny's next door neighbor, waited for Kenny to come home and then stabbed him 27 times in the driveway of his own house.  AB 2428 will require the courts issue a protective order for the victim, their known family or known domestic partner, unless there are compelling reasons not to do so that is stated on the record.   A protective order protects victims from further acts of violence, threats, stalking and harassment by their former perpetrator.  AB 2428 also extends existing law that provide training and sensitivity counseling to hate crime perpetrators who are on parole or in a conditional release program.  This bill is co-sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Legal Center and Chinese for Affirmative Action.  AB 2428 has passed the Assembly Floor and now awaits the Senate.   Twenty-two organizations and legislative entities have already stated their support for AB 2438. Assemblymember Chu is urging more supporters and supporting organizations to write letters in support of AB 2428 and send them to Assemblymember Chu's Capitol office at:   			Assemblymember Judy Chu 			State Capitol 			P.O. Box 942849 			Sacramento, CA 94249-0049  The following documents are also enclosed: 1) Background Sheet: Fact Sheet - AB 2428.doc 2) Sample Support Letter: AB 2428 Support Letter.doc 3) An organization endorsement form (can be used in lieu of support letter): Endorsement Form - AB 2428.doc 4) List of Supporting Organizations: SuppOpp AB 2428.doc   If you have any questions regarding the legal aspect of AB 2428, please contact Daniel Huang of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center at (213) 977-7500 x237 or via email at dhuang@apalc.org.

      Hello, I'm Jen and I'm a dumb ass.  Why I am a dumb ass?  Well, you are one when you stand out all day in the sun without proper sunblock and instead of standing in the shade, you stand in the direct sunlight BAKING...more like burning.  Stupid ass me thought, "Hmmmm maybe I'll get my pasty lookin' like some freakin' east coaster ;p legs a tan for once."  Now did that work? Oh of course not, they still look pretty pasty but not only that pretty in pink.  Well, in my case dumb ass in pink.    That's right ppl, my forearms are pink, especially my right one, my nose is pink, the area around my neck is pink and the part where my legs weren't cover by my skirt are pink.  So if I wear a tank, tiny tee, or shorts, I look pretty stupid with all these tan...who am I kidding pink lines. Arrrrgh.    Why was I outdoors? I was volunteering as a VIP host for the  urlLink Taiwanese American Heritage Week Festival  at Monterey Park. And to top it off my stinkin' elected official never showed up.  PUNK ASS Larry R. Nelson of Artesia.   And what's worse is that I'm in big meetings and presenting this week in front of ppl and not only that going to the Voices Conference in DC where there's going to be lotsa of ppl to see what a stupid pink dumb ass I was.  WHAT WAS I THINKING? 8( Actually now that I think of it, I think someone was taking photos and I was in some of them, grrrrreat, now my dumb assness is archived and for your enjoyment.  The only thing that could make this better is some studly, hetero and single man, scratch that to MEN, would give me massages and soothe me in aloe vera.  Oh yes, baby.

I should since I don't email ppl back anymore and this will be a good way to help update ppl with what's going on with jen.

      The  urlLink Quannum  concert was AMAZING.  So glad, I finally got to see the Quannum/Solesides artists perform and not only that all of them together.  8) This is hip hop at it's finest. They've got the whole package.  They're great emcees cuz they can rhyme and have know how to deliver the goods and not only that have pretty good vocal skills and all this with a great beat and sound compliments of the great DJ Shadow.  It was a good night, I really needed it after such a long week of work and going to DC, it was wonderful ending that night with yummy Brazilian food from Bossa Nova.  YUM!   I had such good food that weekend, I was co-presenting "Searching for Asian America" on behalf of  urlLink MANAA  for  urlLink Visual Communications  annual film fest ( thanks to Leslie and Abe ) and Edwin introduced me to the infamous  urlLink Lela Lee , who was in the documentary. She's coming out with ALAG book next year.  Wishing her much luck on that.   It wasn't a bad documentary, since I had seen "My America (..or Honk If You Love Buddha) by the super talented Renee Tajima-Pena, I wasn't as impressed.  Don't get me wrong, I'm supporting the documentary but "My America" IMHO was much better done and being that it was done before this doc, so I was expecting more.    Eating at The Kitchen was a yummy way to end of that Sunday, but I really got to go explore more LA restaurants.  But wanted to take Rosa to the Kitchen cuz I knew she would like it and she did.     urlLink Speak Theater Arts'  N*W*C* was a good show.  I would recommend it, though I would have like it if they explored a little bit more and explained more of the history of these derogatory words.  Though I know when you only have so much time, you can only do so much.  Pretty good for a buncha undergrad students (GO UCLA and transfer students), I guess after seeing such groups like  urlLink Slant ,  urlLink 18MMW  and  urlLink Culture Clash  perform.  I need a lil something more, but I realize not everyone has had that opportunity to be exposed to such groups.  Or has that consciousness to think at that level yet.  If this was me in high school, this was be a good starter show.  But it's good to know there's more groups out there.    More updates.  Got a preview ride the Tower of Terror for free courtesy of  urlLink OC Register.    urlLink Click here for article      Jennifer Kuo    Age:  26  Residence:  Costa Mesa  Occupation:  Youth coordinator, OCAPICA, Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance   Impressions:  "When the doors first opened, I was wondering if things were going to pop out at you. I guess that's our generation; we need constant stimulation." Recommend it? Yes. "When we had the first drop, I thought 'Oh, is this only as high as it goes?' And then it went up and down again, and way up."  Suggestion:  "If you have to wait in a long line, the ride itself is going to seem short (2 minutes, 28 seconds)." What would bring you back? "It's fun to see other people's reactions."   or you can see me in color  urlLink http://www.ocregister.com/multimedia/tower   Can you believe one of the interviewees had never heard about the Twilight Zone?  Can I say my poor deprived child and geez I feel old.   My coworkers were saying, I actually look Asian in my picture.  Aiyo! They should see my face taken from the ride.  ;p  This was actually my first time to California Adventure since it open.  Got a complimentary day hopper pass but unfortunately, I had a lot of projects at work that day, so I couldn't stay the whole day and go to Disneyland as well.  MAN!!!! 8( Though got to try a couple of rides at CA.  Fun fun fun.    Oh yes, congratulations to the recently engaged  urlLink Naomi and James . You two are adorable together.  You know I have some good ideas for the bachelorette party.  OGs...anyone?  I've sampled and you can sure wash clothes off of those abs and then some.  tee hee hee.    Also a belated congratulations to Steve and his fiancee Michelle.  I'll be there in Sept.  Can't wait to see NY in the fall.  I heard it's beautiful  Now I need to find something formal to wear. Arrgh! Really need to get to a gym, it's really not getting pretty.  Oh, how I hate cardio.

      Whatta day.  Exhausting morning.  But thankful I have such a great boss and coworkers.  Had a nice chat with Janet.  So glad I got to play catch up with her.   IM is such a great invention.  But with all that went down this morning, I wasn't really in the mood to go out tonight plus not really in the mood for the club scene, plus I was feeling a bit anti-social for a variety of reasons.  Just ended up playing with Porkster, so he'll get his exercise.  This is one dog, that's loves me unconditionally, a bit stinky and not human, but hey, he loves to cuddle.   So I ended up watching "Something's Gotta Give" and I loved it.  Diane Keaton is just great, I really enjoy watching her films and how can you not love a former Tangerine Techer.   But she was absolutely great in this film and the film brought up a lot of good points, that I need to think about my own life.  And I feel in love with one of the songs that appeared in the film "Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5 ( yes,  I know I've been sleeping ) but it's such a lovely song.  Need some happiness.  Alright better head to bed, gotta be up early.

      Feeling down, stress and overwhelmed.  Too many things are coming my way and things that I never really wanted to do, but did too keep others happy.  I really need to stop doing this to myself.  Makes me so mad, especially when ppl complain about things but don’t help with solving the issue just bitch and yell to get their way and expect me to do it.   Getting so sick of it all.    Didn’t help that today, everything got off to a wrong start.  Just so tired.  8(

      Man, I give up with this new template. BOO!!!!!! You suck.  And Blogger support/help didn't help much with their response. ( Watch my blogger never works from now on...like anyone reads this anyways.)    Anywho, lot has happen.  I may or may not update.  But get this, got a lil bit more cynical about guys and what not, I may discuss one day. But what's new, guys suck, well especially when it comes to me, I know how guys feel like when they get the whole friends deal. Can't believe I got myself into the same situation 2 years ago.  I should have saw this coming, stupid heart as well as the other H. Well, I'm not completely down like I was 2 years ago.  But I just don't have any luck during this time of the year.  I need to stay away from guys from the months of May-July.  Anyways, so I swore I was going to stay away from romantic things (movies blah blah) and guess what I do? I see that Sabrina (the old school one with Audrey Hepburn) is on TV and I start watching it.    I'm hopeless.   *sigh*   So I guess I'll just stare at eye candy in Hawai'i and gorge on Hawaiian food and scare children as I attempt to squeeze in something I can swim in.   ARRR matey...there she blows.

I can't thank you enough. I really needed this trip. 8)  I can't believe I didn't take Mary Anne's advice and get a Keali'i Reichel album cuz I'm listening to some clips I found online and I'm going to get all the albums. I love his voice, it's just so beautiful. You can just feel the passion when he sings and it's great he's concern about his Hawaiian community and it's well being. I love Hawaiian and local music. YEAH!!!!!!! 8D Hopefully I'll get time to update about my trip on here.
