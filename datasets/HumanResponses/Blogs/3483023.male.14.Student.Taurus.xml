      Hey, I'm Bored Outta My Mind! I Love The New Newlyweed Commercials With The Old People Acting Like Nick & Jessica. I Also Like The New Show On MTV Called 'Your Face Or Mine'... Not Really Any Point To The Show, But It Does Take Up Time. I Don't Think I Am Doing Anything For The Rest Of The Week Either, I Will Eventually Get Around To Reading My 'Kansas State Driving Book' Thing, But The Book Is So Long And Has So Little Letters, LOL, Its Boring And Stupid! All You Need To Know To Drive Is Green Means Go, Red Means Stop, Yellow Means You'd Better Hurry Your Ass Off Or You Have To Stop And The One Thing You ALWAYS Need TO Remember If Your In A Accident You Always Say ' I DIDN'T DO IT ' And You Never Ever Ever Admit To Doing It! I Am Off To Go Do Something Interesting... Change Out The Laundry, LOL... C YA'll Next Time!

      We Didn't Really Do Much Today Either, Just Kinda Set Around. After Everyone Got Home We Went And Rented 'Ron White: They Call Me Tater Salad' & 'The Big Bounce'. I Really Liked 'They Call Me Tater Salad' It Was Halirous And I Would Recommend It For Mature Audiences To See, But None Of The 'Young Ones. As Far As 'The Big Bounce'... They Could Have Made The Movie Last 10 Minutes Long, But They Stretched It Out Into A Good 1Hr &amp; A Half. The Movie 'The Big Bouce' Is Basically A Movie Where Everyone Screws Everyone Ever....Stupid!

      Today We Didn't Do Much! We Watched 'Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen' I Can't Say I Would Recommend It To Anyone. The Movie Was A Good Hour And A Half And It Was All Pointless. Another Reason I Wouldn't Recommend It Was Because 'Linday Lohan' Sings At The End, And NO ONE Deserves That Kind Of Torture!

      Today I Woke Up, And I Got To BabySit Until 3 'O Clock. I Had To Watch My 6 Year Old Cousin TJ Until Everyone Got Back From What They Was Doing. Everyone Got Home Around 3, We Didn't Do Much Until Later In The Evening. Later In The Day My Uncles Sister Came Over With Her 2 Kids (Twins, 15) &amp; Her Nephew (Baby, 1) I Think It Is. That Was 'Fun', Ok I'm Not Going To Lie...... IT WAS HELL! Personally I Don't Know How Everyone Else Listened To Them, I Almost Went And Vomited In The Bathroom, They Are More Annoying Then Hail In The Afternoon!

We Eventually Got So Bored We Decided We Needed To Thank Of Something To Do. We Decided To Head Over To 'Frontier City' (Amusment Park)... That Was Fun. We Rode About Every Ride There, But There Was Like 5 Rides That Where Closed, That Kinda Pissed Us All Off. After Frontier City We All Just Headed Home, Watched TV, And Then Eventually Went To Sleep, Fun!

When We Got There We Didn't Really Do Anything, In The Evening Us Kids (3 Cousins &amp; Me) Drove Out To Our Grandpa's House In The Country....

       My Day Today Consisted Of Doing Just About Nothing! They Finally Got The Sprinklers Working At The Apartment We Currently Live In, And They Fired Them Up To, But I Didn't Go Play In The Water Though...I Would Feel Like A 2 Year Old. I Noticed Quidus On TRL Got A Hair Cut, He Looks Like A Dog, I Found That To Be Kinda Funny! I Really Don't Have Much To Talk About Today, Not Much Going On In My Life.... Sorry =( She's Innocent I Tell You, INNOCENT!

       WoW, Today Has Been A Boring Day! I just seen on the news that Micheal Jackson might be looking at adopting 4 more kids, that just makes you sick! I personally think the judge in his case should ban him from getting any more children and should probably take away the ones he has now. Ashlee Simpons CD came out today, I have no urge what-so-ever to get it, but I just thought I would say its out. 'Taking Back Sunday' In On MTV.com The Leak This Week... I Have Never Heard Of Them Before, But I Will Probably Drop By And Listen To The CD Sometime This Week! Tonight Is BigBrother/AmazingRace/Summerland Night, I Have Been Waiting A Few Days For Some Good TV Shows! I Did Nothing Today... I Did The Dishes, Did The Laundry, Played On The Computer, &amp; Thats All Folks!

       I Like The New Blogger Tools, I Got Used To Them In About 5 Seconds! Since My Last Post I Went To The Lake, Got A Gerbil, And Found Out What Other Crap I Will Be Doing In The Future! I Got My Gerbil Silver Ryan On July 14th And So Far Everything Is Going Good! On Thursday My Dad And I Went To The Lake (F'n For Hour Drive) With My Aunt,Uncle, &amp; Cousins. Camping Now Days I 'Tell You... Camping Used To Be Setting Up A Tent, Cookin Up Hot Dogs &amp; Smores, Fishin, And Sleepin! Camping Now Days Means You Fire Up The RV, Drive To The Lake, Unload The Boat Into The Water, Turn On The AC In The RV, Cook A Steak On The Stove Inside The RV (Maybe Over The Fire If You Are Real Daring), And Of Course You Sleep In Your Nice Comfy Bed!&nbsp;Now... I Will Be The First To Say That I Would Rather Stat In A RV Rather Then I Tent, Actually I Would Rather Just Stay In A Hotel/Motel And Go The The Lake In The Morning And Stay In The Hotel At Nights, And I Would Really Rather Just Stay Home And Watch TV, God... I Sound Like A Lard Ass! I'm Really Not I Only Weigh 113 Last I Checked (Around A Month Ago). I Have Never Really Posted What I Look Like.... I Have Brown Hair, I Am 5' 6-7", I Am 14, I Have Greenish Eyes, Umm... IDK What Else To Say About How I Look! Anywayz....I looked at are upcoming school calender and found out we start school on the 25th instead of the 23rd, that made me happy! I also found out that I am really fuckin tired! I really should be sleeping right not... but I'm not, but as soon as I am done with this I am going to bed! I just smacked the shit of of my lap top with my foot, Oh Well....! This weekend is our local 'Prarie Port Festival' nothing really special going on. My dad has to give a check to the 'Prarie Port Queen' for something, I guess since he is the Manager of the biggest store in this town (Wal-Mart) he just gets to do crap like that. I am not really a big fan of Christian music, but I heard 'Redemption' by Jars of Clay on the radio today when I was flippin through those wonderful stations and it was a really good song, you might wanna check it out!   I'm just about outta crap to say and gripe about... Post Agian Tomorrow (Or Today Since It Is 3:14)... So Much For My Happy Ending!

       Hey Everyone! I'm Getting Good At Coming Up With Titles For My Entries! If You Haven't Caught On Most Of My Titles Are Episode Titles From OTH, Names Of Songs, Lyrics From Songs, Or Just Pop Outta My Head! I Guess Today We Won't Be Going Grocery Shopping Or Going To The Eye Place! Tomorrow We Have To Go To A Funeral For A Guy That I Have Never Met (Sounds Like Fun, Huh?) So Instead Of Having Today Off My Dad Is Taking Tomorrow Off! I Think After The Funeral I Am Going To Stay At My Aunts (My Dad Has A Meeting To Go To Fri-Sun) So If I Don't Update My Blog For Awhile Everyone Will Know I'm Not Missing! I Am Currently Watching 'Man Behind The Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story' On VH1, The Movie Appears To be A Good Movie! I Wish They Would Have Showed Him When He Was Younger, Because From When The Movie Started Michael Acted Like A Child, And There IS Something From His Past That Causes Him To Act The Way He Does, I Hear It Was Because He Didn't Have A Childhood, But They Could Have Showed Some Of The Childhood He Didn't Have! Will, I'm Going To To End This Entry So I Can Go Watch The Movie- Bye!

       Heya Everyone! I Had A Greeaaatttt Day Today! I Didn't Do Much Set Back And Relaxed, But You Knowo What... I Enjoyed The Relaxation! This Evening I Had To Go Out The The HS To Get My Picture Taked For My 'ID' For My Wonderful Freshmen Year Next Year! I Fucked Up When They Were Taking The Picture, She Counted Down 3-2-1, Then After That She Said 'Keep On Looking At The Camera Until After It Flashes' And Of Course After She Said 1 I Looked At Her (She Was To My Right) So I Almost Fucked Up My Picture, But I Processed The 'Look Until It Flashes' Fast Enough To Turn Around And Look At The Camera! So She Asked Me If The Picture Was Ok (She Was Doing This All From Her Labby) And I Looked At It, Wasn't My Best Picture, But I Knew If I Took It Agian, It Wasn't Gonna Get Any Better! So Know I Have A 'ID Card' To Carry To School With Me Everyday, Fun! Tomorrow I Think We Are Going Grocery Shopping, Get My Glasses Fixed, And Get My HairCut And Tipped, Sounds Like Fun, Huh? Well, I'm Outta Here, Good Night World, Don't Let The Bugs Bite!!

       Hey Everyone, I went back and thought about the letter and I kinda started talking about something and didn't really finish talking about it. I started to talk about how I had the 'agreement' with the friend to not have sex until we where married and how she broke that agreement. Well, I kinda just stopped talking about it there and moved on. Now I'm gonna finish my though on sex before/after marriage. I know in my mind the right thing to do is wait and have sex after marriage, but I guess in my pants (lol) I keep thinking, well... why wait until marriage, sex is sex no matter when you have it first. I know alot of people say if you wait until you are married it will mean more, but I mean having sex for the first to no matter when is going to be special! It just seems so stupid to me to wait until marriage, but I know that is the right thing to do,I guess I'll just have to wait and see where things go! Something else I mentioned in the letter (and as you might have noticed someone commented on) is the fact that I wanted to and dreamed about graduating at Blackwell! Well the fact is... I'm not going to graduate and Blk I can dream about it all I want, but I'm not going to graduate at Blk, and you know what... I think I'm gonna be ok with that! I mean El Dorado is a great town (Also A Growing Town, Thank God!) and great people live in El Dorado! The one thing that IS going to interesting is the fact that my dad wants me to go to College in Kasnas (He Has A Nice Plan Of How My College Is Going To Go) and when it comes down to it, I don't want to go to college in Kansas. I said in the letter 'Home Is Where The Heart Is' and I love El Dorado I really do, I also love/d Blackwell, but when the fact is 'Home Is Where The Heart Is' and my heart will forever be in small town America Crescent, Oklahoma. My plans for college involve going to School in Oklahoma (Go OU!), but like I said earlier my dad has other plans, but you know what? I'm gonna take 1 year at a time, this is my Freshmen year, so I'm going to go and be a Freshmen, And Kick Some Ass While I'm At It! LOL, If You Can't Tell I'm Getting A Little Excited About Going To High School! Go Class Of 2008!- I Feel Alot Better Now!- Aaron

      Hey,  Do you ever get the urge to type something, to cry a little, to cuss someone out? I think that is a feeling everyone feels at some point in there life, but I don't anyone will ever admit they they have got the feeling. I love the song One Thing by Finger 11 because it brings up a great point that a lot of point don't notice. In the song it goes if I gave it all away for one thing, Wouldn't that be something? And In my opinion if you gave it all away for just one thing, then that is a big thing, but I guess in some peoples minds its nothing at all. The argument over this issue is just like the argument over the glass of milk, is it half full or half empty? Personally If you came up to me tomorrow and asked me that question I would say half empty. I wish in my mind that the 1st thing to come to mind was half full because that is a great way to think about life, but it isn't. Do you ever see something and outta the blue just get angry over it or something? I do stuff like that when I'm watching the Weather and the weather guy says something stupid, I get angry and wanna give him a piece of my mind, but there is nothing I can do about it so what is the point of even getting angry? I think getting angry over little things has got worse through the generations, but I don't really know this for sure because well, I'm only 14, give me a break. I have seen old movies and it just looks like everything was so simple back in the day, but movies know days prove that what happens in movies doesn't really happen in real life. Once again I don't really know why I am typing this, It just feels right, it feels like I may get something good out of typing this, and if you can get something good out of doing next to nothing why not go ahead and do it? Have you ever been just setting in bed or something and just thought in your mind that you need to start praying more often, that happened to me last night, I really started to think about stuff when I got that feeling last night. It was sad though because I started to pray and while I was playing I feel asleep, I think the people that say the teenage years are the hardest times are right, being a teenager sucks! I have also been thinking lately about sex, and yes I'm still I virgin don't even go there. I mean when you become a teenager you start getting the urge to go out and have sex and all that, but I made a promise with a friend a year or so ago that we wouldn't have sex until we got married and that promise has meant a lot to me. Just recently I found out they my friend had sex with her boyfriend, and that just kinda hurt in my heart. I mean I felt that we would both really make it until we were married, but I guess I was wrong. If it makes you feel any better my friend said that she didn't like the sex and didn't ever want to have sex again. I think I am writing this so I can post it on my blog and let the whole world see that it isn't just them having these issue, it is everyone. It was really weird how I started to write this, I got off AOL, and as soon as I did I just got the urge to open Micro Word and start typing, I am getting getting sleepy know, but I still feel that I most type more for you to read. Me and my dad have been having little issues lately, I mean he will piss me off, I will piss him off, that kinda issue nothing really big. Most of what he has been doing that is pissing me off is the fact that he needs a hearing aid, and needs one know! Something else that he has been doing that is making my mad is using my lap top, this my lap top, he has his own computer, why in the world doesn't he use his own? I know I most really sound like a rich preppy kid, but to be honest I'm not really that preppy. I mean I wear preppy clothes and crap, but besides that, I'm not really preppy. For some reason I have a issue with talking, I just don't talk a lot, I blame a lot of this problem on my dad and I don't really know if it is fair to blame him, but I don't really know who else to blame. I started my life living in Crescent, Oklahoma living around all my family and stuff. I had true friends in Crescent and friends I will never forget, ever! After my 4th grade year we moved to Madill, Oklahoma because of my dads job. When we moved we didn't know anyone from Madill or anyone really around there. It took my awhile to get used to living away from my family and crap, because I mean home is where the heart is and my heart was (and always is) in Crescent, Oklahoma with my family and friends. Madill, Oklahoma is a unique town (Madill aka Little Mexico) that was basically built on people going to Lake Texoma. If the lake was just to vanish overnight or something, so would the town. It seems like it was when we got to Madill that I really started to be quite, I just had a hard time making new friends and stuff. I think in my mind it was one of those thing where you think, I already have friends, why would I need new ones, but I don't think at the time I relized that I wouldn't be going back to Crescent anytime soon to go to school. So basically while I was going to school in Madill it was hell, to put it bluntly. I did manage to make some good friends and I had a few girlfriends along the way too, but after we moved on I really only had 1 true friend from Madill. Something else that I started to notice while living in Madill was the fact that I started having more girl friends (just friends) then guy friends, and I don't know that just doesn't seem normal for a guy to have more girl friends then guy friends. I think a lot of my quitness started in Madill because I had no one to talk to. My dad was the Manager at the local Wal-Mart so he was barely ever home, my dad and mom split up when I was like 1 or so, so there was no mom to talk to, and as I stated above I had a hard time finding friends in Madill. Anyways, after going to 5th and 6th grades in Madill my dad and I moved again to the wonderful Blackwell, Oklahoma. During my 7th grade year at Blackwell I once again had a hard time finding friends due to what I would think is the quietness and so I hung out with some interesting 8th graders at the time. Hey, I had older friends, whats to hate about it? But when my 7th grade year came to a end of course my 8th grade friends moved up to be freshmen leaving me all along with a big bunch of people my age, scary! So basically I started my 8th grade year off just like I moved to town, I had to get new friends! After a long search I eventually found a nice group of people to hang out with, but I just wasn't to happy with them all the time. I did notice that I would get to where I would open up and talk to them unlike I would to just any group of people, it sounds like I have a trust issue doesn't it, go ahead say it, you think I have a trust issue! Well, I even myself sometimes think that I have to have a high level of trust in people before I will talk to them, but that isn't true, or at least I don't think. I mean I think back and don't see any reason why I would have a trust issue in the first place, any ideas? I forgot to mention that while in Madill my dad found a girlfriend and she moved with us to Blackwell, sorry I left that detail out. My 8th grade year was actually starting to get better, when my dad announced that he was going to start applying for stores again so he could run a Super Center. When I first heard him say he was going to start applying again I wasn't to shocked because that is kinda what he always wanted to do, run a Wal-Mart Super Center and after so long of working for wally world he could know do it, and that is what he wanted to do. I really wanted to support my dad in applying to stores, because I knew that was what he wanted to do and that would make him happy, but to be honest I was just in plain denial that we were almost for sure eventually going to have to move again, and this was all coming when I was actually kinda starting to fell at home somewhere! Eventually in December of my 8th grade year or atleast around there my dad got a store in El Dorado, Kansas. It took my awhile to tell people I was moving, because well, I could hardly believe it. I knew when we got to Blackwell that we probably wouldn't spend our whole lives there, but after being there for a year or so that fact just kind of faded away, it is hard to explain. I even once had a dream that I was graduating HS in Blackwell, but I knew that it probably just wasn't gonna happen! The word finally got around school that I was leaving and I don't really think many people really gave a shit, but that's there problem not mine, even though it did affect me. I felt kind of good on my last day of school though, I kinda felt like some people cared. I remember in my Science class we had a going away party and stuff, that kinda made me feel good, but I really think someone just suggested it to get out of doing work, and with all that over on January 29th, 2004 I left B.M.S and tried to forget all the memories I had from the place! I really wish we could have stayed in Blackwell, I really do, I loved the town, most of the people and everything. The only thing I didn't like was the road construction and druggy neighbor we had across the street. I think it was around the 6th or 7th of Febuary when I started going to school at El Dorado Middle School (EMS), and lets just say it was a rough start. I kinda started out at EMS just like I started out at Madill, I have friends already why do I need new ones? And so I guess I just went into quite mode and didn't really do much talking while in school. I did talk to my friends from Blackwell after school though, I mean they are my friends of course I talked to them. I did make some friends while going to EMS, but I mean non one I would jump infront of a car for or anything like that, just friends that I can talk to during school and stuff like that. I just don't really know about El Dorado. My dad likes it here, likes his job and stuff like that. Oh Yeah, once again I forgot the story on my dads girlfriend. She moved with us once from Madill to Blackwell then she moved with us again from Blackwell to El Dorado, after being here for about a month or so she started cheating on my dad with a friend of hers. I don't really like to talk about her, because when I do it just kinda pisses me off, but I think she has also caused some of the mental problems in my life, and by mental problems in my life I mean like the fact that I am Ultra Quite and stuff like that. We got out of school sometimes in May, I didn't really do anything all summer, and here we are, all caught up to the present? What really is the present, I mean the present isn't the past of the future, but when I type 'right now is the present', when I typed 'right' is now in the past, so how can there ever really be a present? There are many great mysteries on earth and I don't have plans on talking about them all here, but I have and have plans to talk about a few. Something else that I think is wrong with my life is my family. I have 2 grandmas that I just don't know what I'm going to do with just yet! I have one Grandma (Norma) who ever time I see her or call her she always grips about how I need to call more often, and everytime she gripes about it I just want to ask her right back 'why don't you try calling me for once?, but I never do ask that, because that would be rude to ask. So, basically I'm not calling that grandma anymore, and It really doesn't hurt inside or anything because I knew that I guess this is probably a nicer way of saying 'why don't you call me?. I have another grandma that just recently got remarried to a trucker and she has changed so much since she got remarried. She used to be like always there when you needed her and stuff and now she is hardly ever there. Like I went to Crescent a few weeks ago to visit my family and my Grandma Pat (she lives in Watonga, Oklahoma) seen me towards the beginning of my stay and while she was there she said she would see me again on Friday when we were all going to meet in Kingfisher to go do something. Well, I think it was on Thursday her new husband came home early from delievering something and when he is home she waits on him hand and foot, and that is just plain stupid! So I guess pointless to say she was to busy to meet us on Friday and that just kinda pissed me off because I am her grandkid and she hardly ever gets to see me, but she would rather wait hand and foot on her husband then see me. I know what we was going to do in Kingfisher know, we where going to meet at Wal-Mart to look at backpacks because she was getting all her grandkids a backpack so my cousins and I where going to meet her there and pick one out, but like I said she was too busy for us! After I got back home I got a check in the mail from her for $20 to get a backpack and I still haven't spent the money, and I really don't know If I'm going to. It just pisses me off how her priorities go in her brain, I just don't get it! I am seriously just considering tearing up the check and putting it in the trash or cashing the check and donating it to a Back-To-School supply fund for kids that can't afford there back to school supplies, wow, that sounds like a good idea, I think that is what I'm going to do! My mom (actual mom, the one my dad divorced) emailed me awhile ago asking me when I was coming down this summer and what it comes down to is 2 she needs to plan this stuff earlier! I can't wait until August 1st to find out she wants me to come down during the summer. I mean at the end of July on I am busy doing stuff to get ready back for school almost any chance I get out of the house! I still feel like I need to type more, tell more, get more off my shoulders, but I am just drawing a blank when it comes to what I need to type about next! With all that said I think I'm going to close this letter with a though about the whole letter, a tear about the sad parts, a smile about all the funny parts, and maybe a new outlook on life, just maybe!  -Aaron

      Hey Everyone! Sorry I Didn't Post A Entry Yesterday, I Really Thought About It, But Didn't! I Didn't Do Much Yesterday, I Watched Alot Of Nascar Stuff, But Besides That I Didn't Do Much! Today I Watched The Actual Nascar Nextel Cup Race, Harvick Finished 8th, Not Where He Finished Last Year (Last Year He Won), But 8th Was A Great Finish Since His Car Was A Piece Of Crap! After The Race We Went To Wally World (Wal-Mart) And Spent Some Money! Didn't Really Get Anything Special, But We Did Manage To Spend Some Money! Tomorrow I Have A 'Youth Commission' Meeting & Enrollment, I'm Sure Both Of Those Events Will Be A Blast, NOT! Ok, Well I'm Done Talking/Griping/Ranting/Raving/Complaing- Talk To Ya Later!

      Hello World! So Far Today I've Cleaned The Bathroom, And Tried To Play With Silver! I Really Needed To Clean The Bathroom, It Has Needed To Be Cleaned For Like The Past 4 Months, LOL, It Is Clean Now... That Is All That Matters! I 'Tried' To Play With Silver, But He Keeps Biting Me For Some Reason, I Think I Pissed Him Off! Earlier I Watched Last Years Brickyard 400 (Nascar Race), I Watched It Because My Favorite Driver (Kevin Harvick) Won That Race, And When You Know Your Driver Is Going To Win A Race (ReRun Or Not) You Just Can't Stop Watching The Race! Know I Am Watching Last Weekends Race At Pocono (Nascar Race), I Know Jimmie Johnson Is Going To Win, But I Missed The Beginning & End Of The Race, So I Am ReWatching It! I Think Studio 7 Comes On Tonight, Yeah! I Know Alot Of People Said That 'Studio 7' (Show On TheWB) Was Stupid And Probably Scripted, I Actually Really Liked The Show And LOVED The Trivia! Its Nice Watching A Trivia Game Where You Know Some Of The Answers! Ok, I Might Post Another Entry Later In The Day If I Do Something Else, GoodBye World!

         WoW, I Am Tired! Today We Went To Wichita For School Clothes & Then Went And Got Some School Supplies! School Clothes Shopping Was A Nice Little Challenge, I Started Looking At What Kind Of Stuff Places Had And It Was All Either Gay Stuff, REALLY Preppy Stuff, Or Gansta- I Guess Thats Whats In, ICK! While We Was In Old Navy (Where I Usually Get Alot Of Clothes) I Was Looking Around And Found Jack Shit, One Employee Came Up To Me And Asked 'How Are You Finding Everything Today?', Lets Just Say My Reponse Wasn't Very Nice! All They Had Was Jeans &amp; Crappy Shirts! After I Got Done Shopping For Clothes At The Mall We Went Over To Kohls (Probably Not Spelled Right) And I Got Some More Clothes! After That We Headed Back To El Dorado To Go To Wally World! At Wally World I Got Some Undies (Box Briefs And Boxers For Those Who Want To Know), Socks, And Some Basic School Supplies! It Is Kinda Hard Shopping For School Supplies In HS Since You Don't Find Out What You Need Until The First Day! I Ended Up Just Getting A Notebook, Mechanical Pencils, And Pen- I Already Have A Binder &amp; A Calculator! After That I Came Home, And Here I Am Typing To You! GoodBye!

        Well....I Got Silver's Caged Cleaned, Worked A Little On The Laundry, And Watched TRL, Yeah, I Got Everything Done! I Recently Figured Out Our New Neigboors (We Live In A Apartment, They Live On Top Of Us) Are College Students, And So Far I Can Tell There Are Going To Be Atleast 3 People Living Above Us. This Is Going To Have College Students Living Above Us, NOT! They Are Already Louder Then Day, And They Leave And Go Like 500 Times A Day! I Will Be Glad To Get Away From Them When School Starts, I Hope That The Local College Starts School Before We Do Though! GoodBye World, Talk To Ya Later!

If You Can't Tell I Kinda Did This Last Weeks Monday-Thursday Blogs Today, I Just Changed The Date So It Would Appear I Wrote Them On The Date On Which The Events Occured. I Come Home To Find We Have New Neigboors On Top Of Us And They Are Being A 'Lil Loud, Ok, That Are Being Way To Loud! I Only Got 49 EMails From When I Was Gone, I Figured I Would Have 100 To 150!
