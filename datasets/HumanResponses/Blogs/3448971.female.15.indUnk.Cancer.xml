      Like I said today I am very happy because, today is Friday and also there're just two more days until school is over. However today  we have a math final and I am very nervous because I think the math final is going to be hard. Yesterday we had the English final and I think I did well. Then on Monday and Tuesday we're having our history and science finals. On Tuesday is our last day of school. Then I think we're coming back to school on September 11 or so.

      This summer I'm going to have my (Quinceanera) Sweet 15th party. That's why I'm very happy. I'm counting the days until the day of my party. From now until the day of my party there's 18 days left. My party is going to be on the 26th of June. And today is the 7th. I feel so happy because all of my friends and cousins are going to be there with me. Even though my birthday is July 3rd my party is goimg to be a week before.My dress is just like the dress that this doll has and it's being made it Queens and I have to go to pick it up on June 18th. I love my dress because it's exactly like I wanted it. It's tight at the top and very big at the bottom. On friday we were rehearsing and today we are going to rehearse too. We have to rehearse a lot so that day everything could work out fine.

      Lung cancer is the number one cancer killing. At last the scientists and all those people working hard to defeat lung cancer have made a difference. The rates of lung cancer in women have decreased. The Scientists from the National Cancer Institute ,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the North American Assossiation of Central Cancer Registries say that it was about time that the rates of lung cancer in women have declined.

             Reggaeton is a type of spanish reggae. Reggaeton originated from Puerto Rico. There're a lot of good music groups of Reggaeton that I like. For example Zion y Lennox, Tego Calderon, Wisin y Yandel, Big Boy, Speedy, Don Chezina etc.  I love all of the Reggaeton singers and it's hard to choose from all those singers. However if I had to choose ,I would choose Don Omar because he is very good and he has a lot of good songs that I like a lot. If you want to see Don Omar then click  Don Omar
