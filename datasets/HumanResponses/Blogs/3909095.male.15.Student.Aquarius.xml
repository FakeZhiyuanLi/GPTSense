      I was just thinking about this- how come there are so many people, musicians, and others that think that life is such a drag?  I dunno, but I think my life is pretty darn fun, I mean I have the best friends that I could ask for (EXCEPT Stephanie Rendall, who stole my Blog Idea! LOL Just Kidding, Steph)  Anywho, I just dunno.  Even though I didn't get DM, I will still be marching!

      Well, here's my first post to my brand new weblog.  I dunno why I wanted one, but I did, so I made one.  Grrr... I'm not too happy right now.  Cammie and Karen are our new drum majors in marching band.  But hey, what are you gonna do?  I support Rymer's decision and trust his judgement, but I just really wanted this.  Oh well...  Off to go order a DVD!  Yahoo!
