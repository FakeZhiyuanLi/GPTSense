       show me how we end this alright show me how defenseless you really are satisfy an empty inside that's alright, let's give this another try.   so everything's falling apart again. lee and i had another fight and this time it doesn't look so good. but i don't know what to do anymore and everything's just hazy and lonely. maybe we just need a break from each other. staying together all the time couldn't have been very healthy for long right. it's all just messed up.  i also had my writing assessment thingie yesterday which was quite alright really. i wrote some junk with long words and lets hope they think it's impressive. the bad thing was that lee was sitting two rows over and i kept staring at him :( everyone else is so tired of us and i'm getting tired of it too.  but monty cheered me up on monday night. she came over and made me listen to her singing along to britney lol. she's so great.   i'm sleepy.

       i've found a reason to show a side of me you didn't know   so i made lee go with me to the cd store because i wanted to buy cds, but well matt was dumb enough to ask me to ask what i went to a cd store for, but that's matt. anyway in the store the  weirdest  thing happened. i was picking cds and lee was holding them, and then we asked this guy who worked there what the price of some cd was, and lee left the cds on this shelf thing because he had to go pee or hit on the salesgirl i think. and then when we went to pay, i was looking at the cds and there were about 3 country music cds and i thought lee wanted them and i asked him when he started listening to country music and he said he didn't and i asked why he was buying those cds then and he said he wasn't and that he thought those were mine and i said since when did i start listening to country music! and he said he didn't know! and i said i never did and he said oh and we stood there holding the cds and watching this guy and this girl making out next to the techno shelves. and then i looked at lee and he looked at me and then he went all wide-eyed and said 'i bet the sales guy put them there! when i was gone!' and then we stared at the sales guy who was hitting on this other guy. and then lee put the cds in the funk section and we went to pay and we lived happily ever after the end.  so that was a waste of space and time and energy and brain cells but isn't everything i write like that anyway.

       You're more punk, hardcore, mod, straightedge, emo, indie than me. Your hair is cooler, your pants are tighter, you have more tattoos. You have cooler pins on your messenger bag and your favorite band is more obscure than mine. Your glasses are thicker and blacker than mine, the plugs in your ears are bigger, and you know more people in bands. Because as we all know that's what really matters. In a scene where the music has taken a backseat to the haircuts, you win and I lose.This so-called liking of punk music involves wearing stupidly short skirts with some band t-shirt that you don't happen to know of or a shirt mentioning the word "rock" somewhere on it. However, if you can wear an old-school cartoon character shirt this is also acceptable. Remember to wear something plaid or tartan, usually in red. If you can wear spikes it always looks better. This should be worn with large hooped ear-rings in silver and accompanied with the attitude of "Don't tip me over the edge, I might go and get high". If you can boast that you and your friends were drunk recently it will help a lot. If you cry a lot that will get you attention and the glasses that you wear which aren't necessary will magnify your tears to one-hundred times their actual size. This usually means you can boast that you like the newest rock band, which someone you know has liked for a long time and you can also boast that you have been to Glastonbury. In an age where nothing seems to matter anymore about the colour of your skin, it does matter about the designer label of your underwear.

       i don't know why i'm blogging when i have nothing to blog about. it is earlyearly in the morning and lee is sleeping and drooling on his pillow and occasionally twitching when i occasionally bang up the keyboard. i am frustrated because  STEVE   refuses to come online to amuse me with his intellectual banter. also, jesse and matt have gone off again and i refuse to get out of bed to see anyone else. and rocky's nice hair has grown back BUT he's so emo now but he still loves getting out of the yard and going to harass the woman down the street. i managed to finish reading some stupid books(yes i CAN read wow!) but they were not worth my time and lee also leaves me for his stupid basketball and i feel like i weigh 43276009346 lbs. but i did find a lot of awesome sites which make brillo music icons and i want to just steal them all and i wish i could make my own but rocky makes better icons than me.       &nbsp;   i forgot to say: yesterday when we (meaning me and sammy and mark and lucifer) went to the skatepark there were all these little 9yrolds around and it was scary because mark was saying how i better stay close because he might lose me amongST all those kids and then i hit him and he hit me back and sammy was saying how we should be good examples for those kids and go home and do our homework (it's summer i really don't know where that boy's brain is) and then this kid skated real close to him and he got scared and screamed like a girl and mark and i laughed and he glared and threatened to go to college without us or something. and then after skating we were walking to mark's house i think and along the way we saw this guy and this guy kissing. but i'm a homophobe sorry. okay bye.

        oooooooooooooh blogger is so awesome now. i may have to move out of here.    summer's alright so far. not much been going on, except for that one time we went mad and set off these weird firecrackly things in the park but it wasn't my fault, they were matt's :D and of course most of the summer was spent with those boys and the english who hates me.   i thought it'd be as boring as it ever was but really there were so many scandals. there was that one incident with jesse's chuck taylors in some old lady's backyard and also matt&nbsp;smearing peanut butter on trees and lee trying to find out how many cups of espresso he could drink and monty piling up stuff on the pavement to see if she could get her bra which jase threw over a lamppost and of course nobody realized that i was the mastermind behind all these happenings, but really what would summer be without me?!   ew look at this color. everybody point at it and laugh.   we also went away for another week to this great place that was near a massive skatepark, so that was fun too. i had to lock mark in the closet to prevent him from harming himself but he managed to jimmy the lock using the inside wire from a hanger (or monty's bra) and then he came out cursing me and my children and my children's children and then he sat on a bench and watched the guys. we all know he's gay but i still love him.   all of us had our hair cut and fake-streaked again so we went around a couple of days looking like supporters of gay rights and this guy on the street stopped jesse and started hitting on him so i had to go and pretend to be his impatient lover because monty was too busy chatting up the salesguy in rip curl. she ended up getting a hefty discount too so she's the envy of 50 yr old women everywhere. well she'd probably be the envy of any woman older than 20 since she's only 18 and looks like she's 17.   and when i got home i curled up with my golden and my english and fell asleep because that's all i'm good for.
