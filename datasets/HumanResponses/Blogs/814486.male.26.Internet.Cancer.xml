      Just got a call back from the solicitors, and it looks like the buyer's solicitors are still waiting for the results of the local search... This means that at the earliest we'll be able to exchange next week, but more likely the following week! Not exactly going to plan, but then whatever does? Fingers crossed that I'll get a call tomorrow from the solicitors asking us to exchange there and then...

      Another good thing about England: Mr Kipling's Almond Slices... Especially when Sainsbury's is offering a two for one deal ^_^

      Still no news on the exchange date... Not good. I'll try and speak to the solicitors again today, they're not exactly easy to get hold of though. :-( If they've not rung by 11:00, I'll ring them then. It's so cool - only 27 days left! I can't wait... I can already smell the boulangerie (there's one about 50 metres down from where we'll be staying), taste the cousoucs and cassoulet, see the mountains and feel the salt and sand of the coast on my skin. It's almost as though my mind's already down there, and my body's just waiting to catch up! Still loads of things to sort out here though... and a lot of them we can't do until after we've exchanged. It's going to be wierd getting rid of our newish (a year old now) Peugeot 206, especially since it'll probably be a couple of months until we can afford to get another new car. It's funny how you get used to have such luxuries in life, and feel a little lost without them... I'm sure we'll manage, we lived for a year here without a car, so three weeks shouldn't be too hard. Besides, it's still warm, so biking to work will be nice, and should help get me back into shape (15km each way). Right, today I'm determined to get this Web Services demo working, so I can start to rebuild the way our webserver works - the last thing I want is that the person who takes over my job (eventually) looks in disgust at the state of things. I wish my boss would give me the go ahead for implementing the new web-site - it's a gorgeous application, and a management dream. Fingers crossed... I'll have a chat with him when he's back from holidays next week.

      I was just wondering, after visiting the various news websites I visit every day, why Americans use the date format "Month Day, Year", i.e. August 21, 2002? I've noticed that they do it when speaking too, i.e. "It's being launched on August 21". Fair enough, I guess... I mean each to their own and all that, but it just doesn't seem to make any sense. In Europe, we'd say "It's being launched on the 21st of August", a short version of "the 21st day of August", but "August 21", as far as I can tell, doesn't actually mean anything. I suppose that stretching your imagination, you could deduce that it means "August's 21st day", but that's taking the Mickey, so to speak. Besides, from a purely usefulness point of view, especially on news websites, it's incredibly important to be able to order articles by date. If you've got a long list of articles, all dated "August XX, 2002", it's harder to order them than if you've got "XX August, 2002". It's a bit like putting the time in this format: "MM:HH:ss"... If news websites were to go that one step further, and put the date in the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD, that would make sense, especially when combined with the time in the format HH:MM:ss. Anyone got any interesting explanation for why Americans use that wierd date format...?

      Another day, another rant... I saw The One (starring Jet Li) on DVD last night - great action movie, with some pretty well executed Matrix-like scenes. Certainly helped take my mind off The Mothman Prophecies, even though I was reminded of it while in bed reading Terry Pratchett's "The Truth": there was a line that read "HALF MAN, HALF MOTH"... Typical. Bit more optimistic today since I should be getting a confirmation that we'll exchange contracts this week. It's a little worrying that it's already Wednesday morning, and I've still not had a confirmation, but I'm hoping that the solicitors know what they're up to, and that it'll all be sorted by this afternoon. Ah yes, thanks to The Stone Monkey&trade; I've just remembered I should swap the backup tapes round before I get cracking with my "real" work...

      Hmm. I might have been a bit harsh earlier, commenting on England... To be fair, it has it's own share of "good things": Marmite, Sky Digital, lots of decent games developers, Aston Martin (before it was bought out...), and some pretty original art. The motorways aren't bad either. Ah yes, some pretty good musical artists too.

      A few seconds too late with an Alt-Tab, and you find yourself trying to explain what a sock monkey is, and above all what it is doing on my screen at work, to a passing colleague... Actually, speaking of monkeys (as you do...), I've got a small stone monkey on my desk. The reason for this is not that a furry cloth mascot was petrified but rather because it's my turn this week to change the daily backup tapes - the Stone Monkey On Desk&trade; is a bloody good way of remembering things. Makes a good paperweight, and - if absolutely needed - a handy weapon.

      It's wierd - I just had an IT management meeting where there was a fair amount of planning going on for the future, but I'm not allowed to tell people her yet that I'm leaving... at least until next week. My boss, and some of the other directors know of course, but they don't want me telling my other colleagues until I'm absolutely sure that I'm leaving (even though I've given my notice already!). I guess that's fair enough really, doesn't feel too good though.  We should be exchanging contracts this week, which means we should be getting part (or all) of the 10% deposit on the appartment from the buyer... Once we've got that, I'll be able to announce it properly at work. Can't wait...

      Off to France on the 17th of September... Am I mad? Leaving my job in England, selling the appartment, the car, the furniture to move permanently to the south of France. I don't think it's mad, but still - quite a stressful time. It would be a lot easier if I had a permanent job to go to there, and loads of spare cash in the bank. But anyway, I'm glad - getting out of England, which still seems to be stuck in the 19th century (honestly!), with it's crap weather, crap attitude, and crap island mentality, for the south of France (sun, sea, mountains, French, the Euro, the metric system...) wasn't really a difficult decision to make. I just wish I'd done it sooner!

      Windows Media Player 9 (Corona) is brilliant. Way to go Microsoft! If this is how good it is still in beta stage, I can't wait to see what the final's going to be like... It's just so cool that when you minimise it, it goes nicely into the taskbar - turning into an ultra-mini player, but let's you have a funky popup thing to see your visualisation/movie/whatever. Can't remember where I got it from - probably  urlLink here .

      Saw the film The Mothman Prophecies the other night. Fantastic movie, but one of those ones that make you wish you didn't have to go to bed for about a week, so you could forget about what you've just seen... I must've woken up at least four times, and thought I'd heard stuff - and spent ages thinking about whether these Mothmen really exist or not. If you've not seen the film, and you're old enough to watch it, go ahead - it's well worth it. Just try and watch it during the day, a couple of hours  before  you go to bed...

      Back to work after a nice long Bank Holiday weekend... Shame the weather wasn't too good, but then I did spend most of the time doing stuff around the flat anyway.  Selling the car today! Took it in yesterday for a proper professional interior and exterior clean - £12.95 and it's spotless. They did a really good job, it's almost like new again - even all the deeply engrained fluff off the seats was gone. I'll be driving to the car dealer after a conference call with the States and Oz I've got at 13:00, and selling it for the grand total of about £7500 - not bad for a one year old Peugeot 206 LX with nearly 19000km on the clock...  Time for lunch soon I reckon.

      Well, some good news came from the two meetings I was in today at work, I'm pretty much relieved from my Siebel development duties for the next two weeks! This is a good thing, in case you were wondering... Instead, I've now been assigned to revamping my company's web-site, which is infinitely more fun than anything even vaguely Siebel related, trust me.  However, right now I must pop down to the local Carrefour shopping centre and sign up for contents insurance. I'm really worried about something dodgy happening to my PC at home, and losing my ability to do web work for my part-time company. Hopefully it's not going to cost an arm and a leg... we'll see!

      Actually, here's a quick pre-lunch thought for you to ponder...   What if each day was 30 hours long?   Would you work an extra three hours per day, or would you still do your "9 to 5" and then just have an extre six hours rest/sleep/blog-writing time at home? I reckon that if each day was 30 hours long, then we'd have adapted to that length of time, so we'd basically end up working "9 to 8" - except in France, where they'd still have the 35-hour-week rule in place. ;-)

      Just got back from dinner in Antibes... We went to this fantastic creperie (savoury/sweet pancakes) where the owner greeted us as if we were old friends, which is so typically un-French that it was shocking. The food was great, I had a spinach, egg, ham and cheese savoury pancake with some cider, nothing better than that when the weather cools down a bit (it was about 20 degrees).  As sod's law would have it, it started bloody raining just as we left Valbonne! A week practically without a cloud, and then the weekend comes and you decide to go out for a walk and get some dinner, and it starts raining... Luckily it stopped soon enough, and it's cleared up a fair bit now - hopefully enough to enjoy a couple of hours sunbathing on the beach in Mandelieu tomorrow (fingers crossed)!  Actually, why is it that every Saturday night when you're driving either to or from home, there's always some complete nutter on the road in a banged up old sporty BMW who feels he needs to prove something to his mates sitting in the passenger and back seats by accelerating and charging just in front of a car, narrowly missing the curb and any poor pedestrians in his way? Maybe it's the same bloke each time, lying in wait until we drive past...

      Something incredible just happened here in France: the nation's electricity provider, EDF, shut down electricity supply to parts of the country, including Paris and here in the south of France! OK, it was only for about half an hour, but still... Apparently the reason is because the French governement want to privatise EDF (they are currently a public company), which would mean that most of EDF's employees would lose some of their benefits, many would/might get layed off, and the remaining employees would have to work a lot harder and more effectively than they are now. Harsh, but essentially true. This may surprise you if you have little knowledge of the French culture, but this kind of behaviour is not at all surprising in France.  I guess the question is who the companies will sue for their lost work time as a result of the electricity cut...?

      One of the excellent things about building web-sites for clients in your own time, as a part-time job, is that you sometimes build a strong and friendly relationship with your client. In this case, BJ from Trustive, a  urlLink wireless internet access provider , is my client for some part-time web work. Two hours ago we were in the middle of working on a new marketing/partnership idea he needed help with implementing. Half an hour ago, we just finished completing a couple of laps of the Nurburgring in Ferarri Enzos (on PGR2 on the Xbox, of course...).  On the other hand, some clients take ages to get back to you, even when you spend personal (read: not charged) time trying to improve your relationship with them. Fair enough, in this case the client is a small company who rent out villas to VIPs in the south of France, and it's coming up to high-season here now.  Now it's time for bed though. Need to get some decent sleep in to try and get my head around a problem I've been working on in my full-time job...  urlLink

      Ah, Monday morning. What a joy it is to get up early with the knowledge that you're also going to have to get up early for the next four days. I always wondered who invented Mondays. I mean, someone or some "wise" group of people must have sat down one day and thought, right let's make a week up, and let's stick seven days in it, and let's make sure that people understand that they're supposed to work five of those seven days, oh, and just to make sure people don't think we're doing them a favour, let's make sure they work all five days in a row...  There are two good things about this particular Monday. Firstly, it's the day after England lost 2-1 to France in their first match of Euro 2004 (big football event); and secondly, it's two days until sushi day!  There's this sushi bar opened up recently down in Cannes, called (quite appropriately)  urlLink Sushikan , and some of us here at work are getting together to make a delivery order on Wednesday. As they're a fair bit away (takes about half an hour to get from Cannes to here), they only take deliveries for orders over €100, hence the need for a group order. Hopefully it'll be good... I've been there once already, and it was excellent, if a little on the expensive side.

      Now that I feel I've recovered from last night's paintballing ordeal (as described in my earlier post today...), I'm sort of looking forward to going to England tomorrow morning. I say "sort of" because going there means getting up at 5h00 to be at the airport by 5h30 (not a good thing, any time before 8h is a threat to your health and best dealt with by sleeping), but also because it means that I should be tucking into a gorgeous dish of chicken at Nando's in Reading by mid-afternoon.  Looks like the weather's going to be pants, but I guess I'm just used to the great weather we get living in the south of France... It will be good to get away from the heat for the weekend. I just hope it's not going to be raining the whole time. We've got our friends' wedding to go to on Saturday (the reason for the trip to England), but on Friday I'll be spending some time with my baby nephew Charlie at my sister's place in London, before going to Reading (and Nando's!). Back here late on Sunday night though, so not too long... Ooooh and look, only 20 minutes to go before I can call it "the weekend"! Nice one.

      Today I discovered a new meaning to the phrase "morning aches and pains"... Last night three of my mates and I went down past Mandelieu to a paintball place (basically just a couple of old abandoned buildings in a forest), and ran around like mad kids shooting at each other with our brand shining new paintball guns. This morning, I'm feeling the consequences: two large bruises on the front of my left leg, one on my arse (how quiant...), one right in the middle of my back, and one on my stomach. While you're playing, you don't feel the pain so much, it only kicks in the following day (when your adrenaline has run out...).  I know what you're thinking, you're shocked at how a man so well-spoken, civilised and good-natured as myself could partake in such a vulgar and childish activity. Well, to put in the words of a great philosopher, "it's wicked". No really, once you've put your protective mask on, loaded up your paintball container, and checked the air pressure of the gun, you're already nervous about the fact that you're soon going to get shot at by people with as good an aim as your own (i.e. they carefully aim for your torso, and then shoot a dozen shots in quick succesion, none of which hit your torso, but two of which risk putting you out of the child-making business, one of which barely missing your left ear, and the rest of which fly past nowhere near you). When you're on the field, breathing heavily into your face mask, heart pumping away after legging it across the open field to hide behind a mound of earth so small that even a mole would be embarrased about it, you know that any second now you're going to hear the sound of shots, and hear the paintballs skimming over your head. There's nothing like it to get the old adrenaline pumping...

      So Greece are through to the final of the Euro 2004 football tournament. That's a bit like saying, so the USA is now communist - it just doesn't happen... Well, that makes me proud of the Greeks, it was the first time they'd ever gotten to the semi-finals in such a big tournament, and now they're through to the final round, against Portugal, who they've already beaten 2-1! :-)  Well, I know that all two and 1/2 Greeks of us are going to be walking with our heads held high at work tomorrow... Poor Czechs, they were on a real winning streak, I think everyone interested in the game is shocked by the result.  In other news, I've got one day left to finish the new version of the web-site for the company I'm working for. I had two weeks, basically 10 days, which ended up being more like three weeks because of other projects taking the priority. I'm really proud of the new site, it's very elegantly built, easy to maintain, and fast. Once it's live, and I've had some time to tweak it, I might release it as an open-source project, assuming that my company doesn't object... The best thing about it is how easily and efficiently it seperates content, design, layout and dynamic server-side scripts. When I'm not feeling so tired (been a long week!), I'll go into more detail, but for now, trust me - it's the dog's! ;-)

      It's starting to get bloody hot down here now. Popped out down the local supermarket to buy some Pepsi and stuff, and it was over 30 degrees... Had to put the air-con, or "clim" as they call it here, on. Trouble is that it's not that nice dry heat you get in some places, it's quite humid, and you end up feeling like you need a cool shower pretty quickly.  At least the office has air-conditioning. Even if it is moody, part-time air-con, it's still better than nothing... But it's going to get baking pretty soon, especially as our office is facing towards the sun all day. Luckily I share an office with two ladies, otherwise the smell would get manky pretty quickly - air-con or not. How pleasant...

      "Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up, there's plenty more fish in the sea..." - the chorus from a very original song I heard while I was in England over the weekend. The song's called "Dry your eyes mate" by a band called The Streets, here's   urlLink a link to the video . It features Chris Martin from the band Coldplay, who adds a really nice touch to the song... Go ahead and listen to it, you may not like it, but at least it's not like anything you've heard before - or is it?

      Back from England after what must be the shortest weekend ever... Doesn't time fly when you're having fun? I'm not sure how long it's going to take my body to recover from the damage caused by having three full English breakfasts in three days, and a full Sunday roast lunch, but it was certainly worth it! It was actually sunny for a couple of hours during the weekend too, and if that wasn't shocking enough, it was warm too! OK, enough of slagging off for now, it wasn't that bad. Didn't get to Nando's restaurant though :-(  Lots of upset people over there due to England losing to Portugal on Friday in the football match, but it seemed to be softened somewhat as both nations have the same patron saint (St. George). Don't ask...  So, back in France now until 5 August when we're off to Finland. It's starting to get really warm now, 25 degrees this morning at 9 already! It's actually getting so warm that my mate's girlfriend (who is always cold) has stopped using her hot water bottle in bed at night. Exactly. Who needs thermometres when you have a measure as precise as that?  Anyway, I still have bruises on my legs from paintball LAST WEDNESDAY! That can't be a good thing. They've gone a very non-beautiful greenish yellow. That's OK though, I'm sure they'll be joined by some fresh new ones when we next go paintballing... Planned for tonight, but I'm too knackered to go (and I'm also going to the dentists at 16h30...), so we'll probably go tomorrow or Wednesday again.  The worst thing about going on holiday, even for one working day, is coming back and finding your e-mail Inbox full of dozens of new e-mails for stuff that had to be done urgently on the day you were off, and stuff that has to be done urgently now, and stuff that definitely urgently has to be done by tonight at the latest... So back I go, to plough through the work.

      Crikey the jog was great! I couldn't have chosen a better day to turn over a new leaf... After yesterday's rain, and the wind last night, the air is so clear that it looks as though you could almost touch the mountains and the sea! It was tough to get into the rhythm at the beginning, as I've not exactly been doing much sport lately (lazy bugger that I am...), but after a couple of minutes it all started to feel good. Until I got to the big steep hill, and then it didn't feel so good... This hill is really steep though, I'm not pulling your leg, it's the kind of steep that you have to go up in first gear in a 4x4, or that, if covered in snow in the winter, would be considered a "black"-level slope, for only skiing lunatics to venture down. The good thing about a hill like that is that it can't get any worse, and once I'd crawled, half-dead, over the summit, it was downhill pretty much all the way from there... 25 minutes it took me, not bad for the first time!  Luckily, at the office, we have decent showers and a swimming pool, so I could change before going into work. The alternative isn't a pretty picture, so don't use your imagination... I should really have brought my swimming shorts, 'cause a quick couple of lengths would've been the perfect topping to the jog.  Now I should get some work done, that's what I'm being paid to do here after all, right? ;-)  Here's a pic of the bay of Cannes this morning, click on the pic to link to a bigger version...   urlLink

      There's something really freaky going on with the weather. Last year this time the French goverment was issuing warnings on a daily basis about the heat wave, and the dryness of the forests, and the potential risk of forest fires... This year, it's the opposite - we've had on-and-off rain/thunderstorms for the last couple of days, and there were strong winds and even hail in the north of France. To top it all off, it's so cold that tonight I've got trousers on! I know, it's shocking, but it's so cold that it would be plain daft to just be wearing my boxer-shorts (as I do normally). OK, that might be too much detail for you, especially just before breakfast/lunch/dinner, but I'm trying to make a point here: Global warming, people! Time to stop the polluting, and start the protecting...  Speaking of polluting, what is it with people who leave the default picture as their MSN Messenger picture? The MSN Messenger picture is Microsoft's way of suggesting we be creative. It's your own personal 9216 pixels worth of space to express yourself. Why waste it on a picture of the Windows XP dog? I try to change mine every couple of days, to suit my mood at the time. Usually they are variations of my face on something/someone, for example Einstein. Or the MSN Messenger icon legless green bloke, whatever it is, poor thing.  While I'm on the subject of liberty of expression, for no reason in particular, I'm going to talk about Tuesday's paintballing session. For starters, I didn't get hit! Not once! Am I bloody good or what? Yes, OK, or lucky, but that's beside the point. And, no, I didn't spend the whole two hours hiding behind a wall keeping a low profile, I was out there, charging at my mates as if all hell had broken loose, and firing paintballs like there was no tomorrow! Admittedly there were a couple of close shaves - as I'm sure I've said before, there's nothing quite so adrenaline-pumping as hearing and seeing paintballs flying either side of your head...  But anyway, now it is time to get some sleep. Hopefully, if the weather clears up, I'm going to start jogging the trip to and from work tomorrow. Takes about 45 minutes to walk, so jogging should cut it down to about half an hour. But it's far too easy to let each day go by without doing any exercise, especially after a hard day's work at the office - and there's nothing much to jogging. You just put your shoes and shorts on, and go for it, no faffing about...

      What a week! Feels like the last couple of days have just flown by... But at least now the new web-site I've been slaving over is almost ready to go live. A couple of performance tweaks here and there, some more content to be added, and then it'll be available for the whole world to marvel at! (Not to over-exaggerate or anything of course...).  It's strange, but I am now sure that there are two types of time portals readily available to anyone who wants to experience one. The first is the shower: you get into the shower in the morning, turn the water on, and by the time you've finished, you have absolutely no idea how long you've been in there for. The second is work: the kind of work when you're so absolutely focused and concentrated on what you're doing that suddenly it's lunch time / going home time. Admittedly the latter happens less often than the first, but both achieve the same effect. I know what you're thinking, what happens if, right, you're in the shower AND concentrating on a really involving problem? I think that might result in a black hole, or a trans-dimensional rip in the fabric of space-time itself, but I'm not sure...  Wicked, it just started raining like the rain you see on the Discovery channel when they're filming in the rain-forests. One moment the air was heavy and dry, with thunder claps right above your head, and the next it's jucking it down as if there was no tomorrow... The chefs from the restaurant next door got soaked, since they were eating their dinner outside, poor sods.  By the way, did you know that Greece won the Euro 2004 championship? Greece! Oooooh, happy day! :-)

      At last, I've finally booked my holidays for the Finland trip in August. Unfortunately I need to work at the company's Helsinki office for nearly two weeks out of the month that we're gone, which is a bit pants really, but my boss is going to be on holiday during that time, and she needs me to cover for her...  I'm hoping that we can do the Helsinki-Stockholm two-day round trip at some point during the holiday, but I still have to convince my better half that it's worth the extra cost. Stockholm is a great city, but I've only visited it twice, and I'd like to spend some more time there - sampling the local food and seeing the sights.  I really am looking forward to the trip this year. In the past I guess I've been a little apprehensive about going up north, but now, on top of the other reasons, it'll be great to escape the heat of the south of France for nearly a month. One of the things I'm most looking forward to is the sauna. Now, the saunas in Finland (mostly) aren't like the skanky jobs you get in your local gym, real Finnish saunas are little huts out in the middle of the forest, by a lake, and made of wood. They take over an hour to heat up, powered by wood from the surrounding forest of course, and once they're hot, the temperature is around 70 degrees Celsius - not exactly the ideal temperature to preserve ice-cream in, to put it lightly... Once you've stipped down to your birthday suit, either with your better half, or your fellow same-sex family members, you sit in that scorching humid heat, occasionaly beating yourself with eucalyptus leaves, and chucking water onto the hot coals above the fire, for about five minutes. After that time, when you can practically feel your skin starting to turn pink, you open the sauna door, leg it down to the nearby lake, and quickly wade into the cool, refreshing (read: bloody freezing) water, before heading back, shaking with the cold, to the welcoming warmth of the sauna. Repeat this until you can't take it any more, or until the sauna gets too cold, and then wash, dry off, and head inside for some freshly open-fire-grilled sausages and cider.  One fantasic thing about the sauna is how fast you get pissed afterwards (!). You can just imagine how de-hydrated your body is after all that heat, so gulping down a bottle of cool cider is practically like downing a couple of shots of straight vodka on your average evening out. Quite funny really, and definitely a "feel good" time, especially with some decent sausages to accompany it...

      To my great disbelief, and the shock of my fellow paintballers, I survived last night's round of paintball! I came away almost unscathed, except for a shot in the inner thigh (yes, far too near THAT area for my liking...), which has left a nasty bruise, and a shot on the shoulder and neck, neither of which hurt much nor left a buise, luckily. Unfortunately I can't say as much for my mate Galak, who was pretty hammered, the poor bloke. He even was shot at less than 2m by Fumier - not on purpose, but because Fumier was stressed out, and reacted to the sudden appearance of Galak round a corner, without thinking... I guess that's the danger of paintball, you just have to trust that your mates aren't going to shoot you at point-blank range directly in the nads.    Even closer to the weekend now, with but a few hours to go! Looks like we're definitely heading down to the beach on Sunday afternoon with Galak, Stef, Billou and the lot - I just hope we manage to find enough empty space on the beach for us all to lie together. Even if we don't, we'll probably spend most of the time playing volleyball in the water again, while the ladies work on their tans and reading skills... Couldn't get many people excited about the prospect of renting a catamaran though, lazy buggers, but we'll see - I might be able to persuade them yet!

      Wicked, it's practically the weekend! One more day to go... The clever people over at the weather station have predicted that it's going to be 32 degrees and sunny on Saturday, which means that if we're planning on going to the beach, we should get there early and leave before noon. Getting to the beach any time after 14h is asking for trouble, what with all the tourists using up every spare grain of sand to lie on. Getting there at noon is also asking for trouble, especially with that kind of heat, as you skin will soon feel like it's on fire, and you'll look like a tomato, even with decent sun-tan lotion on...    I'm hoping to rent a hobie-cat (a small catamaran for four people) this weekend, and go sailing round the Isles de Lerins, just off the coast of Cannes. There's this place called "Le Sweet" where you can rent a decent hobie-cat for 28 Euros an hour - not much if you can split the cost between four... I've not been sailing for years, actually not since I completed the catamaran certification course back before I left for uni (about the same time as dinosaurs were still roaming the Earth...). Fingers crossed!    I called up Ryan Air and EasyJet to see how much it'd cost to change the dates of my return flight from Helsinki so I'd be back on 16 August instead of the 30th. The result was not encouraging: 220 Euros! It's actually cheaper to get a direct flight from Helsinki to Nice at 179 Euros...  I think I'll end up doing that, but my better half is just going to check to see if there will be any empty friends' appartments in the city during the time we're there.    Ooh! 17h already, time to call it a day. Got to get home and ready for paintball! Apparently there are two newbies coming today, mates of my mate Galak... Muhahahahahaaa! Poor sods. ;-)

      Ah, lovely jubbly, what a perfect start to a day - jog into work then go for a swim. Can't complain, really! Might not be the world's most exciting/rewarding/well-paid/challenging job, but at least there are some perks...    On the down-side though (me, the eternal pessimist...), it's starting to get pretty bloody baking in our office now. The air-con doesn't work properly since we're halfway between either end, and we have a large room (about 25m2) facing the sun most of the day, it gets quite unpleasant. There is a solution: working in one's underwear. But no, perhaps that's not the most cunning plan. Pulling the window blinds down helps a bit, but then we lose the gorgeous view we have out over the hills and the sea... OK, stop complaining James, just listen to yourself! Fair enough.    In other, more interesting news, the new web-site is well on its way to being released to the public. Our resident part-time network guru is going to be implementing a test "passthrough proxy" tomorrow for the site, which basically means we can do funky stuff with certain URLs, among other things.    To completely change the subject, it looks like I'll be coming back to France early from our planned month in Finland. Working from there is going to be a pain in the posterior, and means that we'll need to stay in Helsinki for two full weeks... So I'll be leaving my better half up there to face the polar bears, and I'll be back here in France all alone for two weeks. (Cue lone violin playing a heart-breakingly sad tune). Nah, it'll be fine, and it'll give me the opportunity to get some work done for my part-time job... Actually, it'll be wierd, that'll be the longest time we'll have been apart for years. (That violin is still playing, you know!)

      Back from my short, five-day holiday, with two things changed since I left: 1) Being 26, I'm now officially well on my way to 50... and: 2) I'm also well on my way to turning into a "leather person", an eloquent term for the old people you see on the beach who spend all day there tanning, and have skin so tanned it looks like leather...    I'm not really proud of either of the above, but neither can be avoided, right? Technically the second could be, but there are few things more pleasant than lying on the beach for an hour or two in the early afternoon, and soaking up the sun. The beaches are starting to get packed now though, what with all the tourists coming down here, but it's not as bad as it will be in August (another reason for going to Finland!). It gets to the point where you practically can't walk to the sea because people are packed together like sardines... You can imagine the state of the water as well, with all those kiddies running around, adding their un-welcome contributions.    The best thing about going on holiday is not being at work. The worst thing about going on holiday is getting back to work, having your e-mail inbox crammed with URGENT things to do, and trying to remember everything you had in your mind before you left...    Last week I was told that my "other-half" at work twisted his wrist over the weekend, so he's taken four weeks off for it to heal. As he was looking after the web stuff, it means that I now have to go back to doing that, and drop the Siebel implementation project, at least until he gets back... I guess I'm happy about that, Siebel's not the most exciting product to work with, to put it lightly! It's supposed to look good on your CV, but I reckon that you shouldn't get good at doing something you don't want to do...    Right, now I'm off to try and wade through this mountain of work I have to do before lunch-time (1 hour and 3 minutes left!).

      &nbsp;That Pink concert last night was wicked! It's amazing how someone so small can have such an incredible stage presence...  Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order "steak tartare" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,&nbsp; you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!  If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.  OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)&nbsp; Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

      That Pink concert last night was wicked! It's amazing how someone so small can have such an incredible stage presence...       Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order "steak tartare" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!          If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.          OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

      That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: "Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchanté!" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! We actually got a ride down with Billou, James and Jeannine (James' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top Audi A4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... The trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.      Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!

Surprising really, when you see how many French people order "steak tartare" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!      If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.      OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

      That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: "Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchanté!" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! We actually got a ride down with Billou, James and Jeannine (James' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top Audi A4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... The trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.      Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!

It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!      If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.      OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

      That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: "Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchanté!" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! We actually got a ride down with Billou, James and Jeannine (James' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top Audi A4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... The trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.    Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!    Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order "steak tartare" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!    If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.    OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.    Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!    Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order "steak tartare" for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those "aquired tastes" you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!    If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber "maki" (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna "maki", like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or "fatty tuna" (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.    OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see "I, robot" tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.

      That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: "Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchanté!" which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space!

      It's the summer, that normally means it's supposed to be quiet and calm, and most people go off on holiday... The only one of those that's true in my case is the last one, unfortunately! It's really hectic here now, what with Thierry off on sick leave (he twisted his wrist, and took six weeks off) leaving me with all the crap that he'd been accumulating over the last couple of weeks and never finished. At least the cicadas and their happy continuous chirping are keeping me sane - that and running into work in the morning, of course. It's so tempting to stay in the pool after the run, and just arse about until lunchtime! Maybe I should try it one day, just to freak everyone out at work...    On top of all the madness at work, I'm going to have to close down my UK company that was so close to being launched (was just waiting for an OK from the bank...) due to legal complications. Basically, you can't have a company based and billing in the UK, and do most of your work and live outside of the UK. Well, I tell a lie, actually you can, but you end up needing two accountants - one in each country, having a tonne of paperwork, and spending most of your income on tax, social security costs, and accountant fees... I was advised by a lawyer friend of ours of another, less complex way of doing it, so I'll be looking into that this weekend. It's really annoying though, because I have four completed web-work contracts waiting to be invoiced, and another one coming along soon: a fair bit of cash. It is really tempting to sod this full-time job I'm working at now (well, while I'm not writing my blog, of course!), and starting up a proper web business down here. I know I'd love it, as developing web sites and tools is what most interests me, but fincancially it's tricky. Maybe when my better half gets a full-time job, then I'll consider it more seriously, but for the moment we need to have at least one sure source of income...    Might be going to see Pink tonight in concert at Juan-Les-Pins - just going to ring the Fnac (ticket place) to see if there are any tickets left, and how much they cost.

      Well, that weekend went by pretty quickly! Time really does fly, when you're having fun (or just when you don't want it to...). New week, same old work. It's actually feeling a little hectic, so I reckon I'll keep this diary entry short. However, before I leave you to return to whatever it was that you were doing, I'll tell you briefly about dinner at BJ's last night. Just imagine the setting: Le Rouret, a quiet and small town halfway between the Mediterranean sea and the Alps, with a gorgeous view of both. BJ really hit a jackpot with the place he's renting. He's paying about 1,000 Euros / month for it, but for that he's got a great 200 years-old village-style rock walled house on top of one of the hills in Le Rouret, far from the main road, and with three decent sized floors (like 30m2 each level, approximately) all for himself. That's about twice what we're paying for our place in Valbonne village, but it's easily twice as big, and twice as nice... Jammy bloke :-)    Hey, a nectarine! That'll do nicely for my mid-afternoon snack... and then back to work.    Oh, and in case you were wondering, no - I never did get round to renting a Hobie cat over the weekend. But where there's a will, there's a way, right? One of the weekends, it will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine (for an hour or two)...
