       urlLink     And here is Menchi all dry and slightly fluffy! He was quite content and purring away when this snap was taken. Don't you just love those blue eyes!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Poor little guy. Menchi is simply not wanting to move. I couldn't resist and had to take a photo of his Yoda impression. Immediately after he received a warm cuddle from me. ^_^&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Just two days later and Menchi has decided that the laundry basket was the place to be. I found him in there while loading the washing machine. Hearing a squeak of a playful meow, I stopped what I was doing and saw him playing peek-a-boo with me.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     My fiancee wanted another cat in the home. We already had two! I was adamant that there wasn't going to be a third.&nbsp;But reluctantly, I agreed to go see the litter with him, and then reluctantly agreed to have Menchi in our home on the condition that my fiancee was the one to prepare for his arrival.  &nbsp;  Folks, you can obviously see where this is leading can't you? I was the one who kitten proofed the house. There is a BIG difference between cat proof and kitten proof. Much of the groundwork had been done thank lord. Then there was a thorough clean of the house and then finally buying of another litter tray, kitten food, bedding etc. And yes, I did let my fiancee know that he was not my favourite person as I had spent my weekend preparing for the kitten  he  wanted.  &nbsp;  When we brought&nbsp;Menchi home and introduced him to Russell and Esper, it was obvious that this kitten was special. It was the fastest cat introduction on record. Russell sniffed and proceeded to lick Menchi. Esper had her nose put out of joint but 12 hours later was willing to tolerate his presence as she did us humans.  &nbsp;  The photo is of Menchi the first night he entered his forever home. And for some reason he insisted on curling up to me, obviously he knew how to get into my heart and stay there.  &nbsp;   urlLink

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink      Russell was my 21st birthday present from my future in-laws. He's the first pet I've ever had. He isn't just a pet cat. He is a companion. If you've ever had a pet of any sort, you can understand this bond. I do not have the ability to give this bond the justice it deserves. Perhaps some details of the first week that I had Russell in my care can help.   When I picked Russell from the litter of which only two kittens remained, he was tiny. In fact, the owners thought he was female and the runt of the litter. When Russell curled up, he fit onto a 20cm x 20cm handtowel as if it was a mat.   The first 24 hours was a steep learning curve for me. I thought I knew quite a bit about looking after a kitten. Boy, was I wrong. If it were not for Ronie and Peter, I would have been lost.   Russell was from a farm and had no concept of kitty litter. He  had  to do his business outdoors. This flew in the face of me wanting him to be an indoor cat. It took a week of using dirt in the litter tray and slowly adding kitty litter to teach him that it was okay to use a tray. At least he understood the concept.   The first vet visit was an eye opener. Russell was a boy. I had named him Snowball after  The Simpsons  family cat but that changed. That and he was full of fleas. I had already known that as Ronie had shown me how to comb them out of his fur and how to kill them. His belly was full of worms.   And in two weeks, Russell DOUBLED his weight much to my relief and was declared flea free and in a month, worm free. And now, Russell is a happy healthy 4 kg indoor cat.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Esper entered our lives in March 2003. She was a rescue from the vet's office. She needed a home or was going to be put to sleep and we needed another cat to keep Russell company. From the second Esper met Russell, she let him know that she wasn't a kitty to be messed with, and in fact has been the Alpha Cat of the household.   Esper has a wonderful loving personality. She is cat that approaches you when she wants to and on her terms. Unlike Russell who doesn't mind a human picking him up for a cuddle. However, with me alone, Esper does allow me to pick her up for a cuddle and allows me to approach her on my terms. This is especially good when I have had to pick her up in a hurry.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Esper is approximately 2 years of age though she is the size of a 9 month old kitten. She hasn't grown a great deal from when we picked her up at five months of age. She's the small cat that I've always wanted.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

      The STARtrek team has left Hedland for Karratha. *Sigh* It was tempting to go and follow them with what is ensuing in the pharmacy, but for the good of the customers and owners I've stayed in Hedland to work. *Bigger sigh*  It's my final shift at the airport today. It saddens me to leave it, even if it is for six months. I've enjoyed my 6 months there and have learnt so much about air travel and cargo and freight transport. My knowledge at the start of my employment was nothing compared to what I know now. And the knowledge base is ever growing.  And here is a link to my workplace's website. I didn't even know that they had one until now!  urlLink Golden Eagle Airlines

      Yolanda and the STARtrek team arrived safe and well in Port Hedland. We all had dinner at the Thai restaurant. Everyone was easy going and the food was good. Though the service could have been faster. I will be heading into the high school with them after my shift at the airport to help with a few sessions. I'm thinking Physics right now as I've never done that session. Variety is the spice of life. ^_^

      I never have liked waiting for anything. There I've admitted it.  I'm sitting here now waiting for a group of university students travelling around the Pilbara in Western Australia doing free science shows for Year 10's. This is something I am involved in but since I wasn't at university studying first semester, I missed out this trip. This is called the STARtrek Science Show. It's lots of fun and you meet kids and teachers from schools from a diverse range of backgrounds.  urlLink The STAR Program   I get along with the ever fearless leader Yolanda really well. In fact I would consider her a friend and a wonderful role model. I can hardly wait to see her once again even if I am going back to Perth in two weeks and I'll be seeing her every second day or so while at uni.   Anyway back to waiting. Between 6:00PM and 7:00PM. I told you I don't like waiting. *Points to time stamp*

      Well that's right! Who am I kidding anyway?  I haven't got anything done on this blog. That's for sure.  I had a somewhat okay day overall. It started off good, then went bad then finished good. So I figure okay.  I went to the airport for my first shift. That went good. Everything went well. I was thinking, "What a TERRIFIC Monday!" However, I discovered I packed the wrong shirt for my short stint at the pharmacy so I had to head home before going there.  And luckily I did too. I found my fiancee at home. I instantly get worried as he never stays home unless he's sick. He isn't one to complain so when he's sick, he's sick. Me on the other hand, sorta the opposite. I'm the pathetic one. Anyhow it turned out that he did call my workplace and he only had the number to one out of the two offices. The receptionist refused to give him the number of the second office despite my fiancee introducing himself and saying that it was important. The call was made at 9:30AM. The plane had left and we were doing a general tidy up.  I got home at 10:15AM. Still no call from the receptionist. I get the details of what happenned from my fiancee after finding out what was wrong with him. He could barely walk!! >_  I also said to my supervisor that I expected an apology from the receptionist. I understood that if I didn't get one, I didn't get one but was very tempted to go to the receptionist to give her a large chunk of my mind plus more. But I wasn't going to because I didn't want to lower myself to her level. My supervisor did however pass this all onto the boss. The boss pulled the receptionist aside at 11:30AM/12:00PM stating that she needed to apologise to me and whether she had even passed the message on. The receptionist hadn't and the boss pointed out that I still wouldn't know had I not gone home and asked for a reason. The receptionist didn't have any reason apart from "I don't know."  During my second shift at the airport, the receptionist makes no effort to apologise to me face to face. She makes a phone call home sounding significantly different to my fiancee who answered it to the point that he didn't recognise her. She then makes a phone call to the second office from which I was based wanting to speak to me FIVE minutes before the plane was due to land. I happenned to be the one to marshall it in, (You know, wave the batons at the plane with those secret signals.), so I HAD to be out there.  The receptionist made a deadly mistake when apologising. And that is ladies and gentlemen is to lie and make excuses. When you apologise, you are admitting wrong a claiming full responsibility and if you can fix the situation, you do so. That is how I have been brought up. And chances are, the person you're apologising to already has figured out what went wrong and where, just like I had today.  She first blamed my fiancee for not stressing the importance of his call to which I state that I had already spoken to my fiancee and that I know that he had stated the importance and that he even requested the number of the second office.   This of course led to the reason that she isn't allowed to give out the number as it is a private number. I point out the fact that the number is allowed to be given out to family and that I only have one fiancee. (And by the way, she does know who my fiancee is and also, it isn't a secret.) She then states that she doesn't know who to give the number out to. I point out that I have been working for the company for a shorter period of time than her and know exactly who to give the number to and who not to The she says that she's been in trouble for giving the number out in the past. (Now she's blaming the boss.) I point out the blatantly obvious again and point out that it was only by pure chance I went home and that my fiancee was barely walking when I got there. I also added that she had no idea how furious I was when I found out and how inconvenienced I was during what was supposed to be a calm 2 hour break as I had to rush and get medication for my fiancee. She said she was sorry and that she was trying her best. To this I simply state, "Thanks anyway." and hung up. And everyone that was around me at the time heard me and was shocked especially the leading hand who heard everything that I said. But I was angry and had no time for arguements.  I think a few people thought that I was still angry but I told them that I was fine and that I was only angry at the receptionist, not them and that I direct my anger at the source, not everything else around me. Which was true since I hadn't said a word of it to anyone until then.  I did mention to my supervisor that I had been rude to the receptionist and explained what had occurred but it was no big deal as she saw it and understood. My supervisor has also had problems with the receptionist so I thought it would also be a good idea to talk to the boss as well to which I did and it was all okay. I did state what I said verbatim and what the receptionist had said.  I hate to think what would have happenned had I not have got home and found out while I was at the airport.  My fiancee will be alright. He should be back at work tomorrow. I basically told him to rest and left no room for arguement. And that is why my day is finishing on a high note.

      Well the great launch of this blog has been delayed.  A good friend of mine is going through a difficult time at the moment. I was talking to her instead of posting and updating. **Big Hug** ^_^  Anywho....here's an update as to what I've been up to.  I went to a performance by the  urlLink  West Australian Ballet Company  last night. It was outdoors in the cool, (perhaps cold), night air under the Milky Way. And picnics were encouraged. I took along spring rolls which were a big hit with the everyone. It was a terrific night out. Though I do have to admit that I was disappointed by the first act. Some of the dancers were slightly out of time and there was one point I was beginning to wonder whether it was even worth the $15 I had paid. But the rest of the show went wonderfully, enough to make up for the shaky start.

      I don't know why but I feel like a million dollars today. ^_^ I won't argue with the Powers that Be about their agenda for me today, (not that I believe in fate and all that).  I'm going to go to the ballet tomorrow night being held at the Civic Grounds. Should be a good night. It's outdoors and it will be cold. I'm making spring rolls for it. But I will have to double check on the status of taking food. There's been so many last minute changes with the thing so far. First tickets were at $40 per adult, and now they're $15 per adult. Four performances by the West Australian Ballet Company. The proceeds are going towards the town's hospital so it's a good cause as well as a good night out.  Will be posting up photos of me and my cats sometime tonight, then a mass e-mail letting everyone know this blog exists. ^_~

      I don't like public holidays. And no, I'm not a work-a-holic. The mail never stops so if I am on the courier route that has the Parcel Post contract, (that is to be read as parcels sent by the average Australian individual/company to another Australian individual/company), work increases at an alarming exponential rate.  Public holidays are worse when they're not national holidays, but state ones. There have been two long weekends in Australia in a row. However, not all Australians enjoyed two lots of three day weekends unless they were jetsetting across the nation.  On Monday, 7th June 2004, it was Foundation Day in Western Australia. It celebrates the founding of our fine state. However not many know this and use this day as an excuse to get drunk or achieve little else. We managed to do the gardening, housecleaning, laundry, shopping, wash the car and bid for Connect-a-Snoopy's on eBay.   I missed the MacDonald's release and didn't know until the last day which coincided with this particular Monday. I won the bid. However, processing of the payment was delayed even though it was done over the internet. Internet banking is not convenient when you still have to wait for a human to process it.  On Monday, 14th June 2004, it was the Queen's Birthday long weekend in the eastern states of Australia. This means a mail delay which means the shipping time of my Connect-a-Snoopy's will be lengthened. But I am assured that they will be reaching me in the very near future.  The $200 we were owed has been paid. Even then, we had to approach the person in order to get the money. It was too much of an effort for them to get off their butt to pay us. Go figure.

      Well I finally got round to setting the ball rolling on this project. It only took one month to do so. There's only the bare minimum at the moment, or perhaps not even that considering the lack of photos. A short delay is expected before anyone can board the voyueristic train.

      No, this hasn't turned into a blog of a Crazy Cat Woman, although this really depends on who you talk to. And if you talk to me, well it just may depend on the angle that the sun is shining. Freaked out yet? ^_~  The truth is, I do need kitty litter. I have just recently become the proud owner of hermit crabs. Yup, it only took two weeks before I took in some critters to call pets. It must be some new record. We'll just ignore the fact that I went into a home that had two dogs and existing hermit crab.  My best buddy keeps them in a Television Terranium. She was down to one lonely crab and they need to live in a community. So anyhow, I figured that I could buy some buddies for this lonesome crab. Somehow, I too ended up with hermit crabs in a tank of their own. Oh, and why am I buying them? Well, I've never noticed hermit crabs on the beach in Perth. And need I remind you of the nasty weather condition called Winter that is affecting Perth?  They're all set up on my desk and well, they don't do a heck of a lot. They dig, eat, sit in their pool of water, walk, climb and a whole lot of sitting. But on the upside, they're quieter than three cats playing "The Fields of the Serengeti" at 3:00AM in the morning. ^_^  *Sigh* I just wanna cuddle a cat, maybe two or three. ^_^

      I finally finalised my timetable today! All labs and tutorials have been assigned.  I had my first lab today. I amazed my lab demonstrator. After two and a half years, I prepared for a lab properly. I even knew what was occurring and what to expect in the results. Though I think I may have freaked out the poor student that was assigned to be my lab partner. She isn't studying a Chemistry Major and wasn't too familiar with the equipment. And on top of that, there was me with about 8 pages of pre-lab summarised notes in addition to pre-lab summarised instructions in my lab book.  Now I've got to prepare for my labs next week, write up the lab I did today, pick a seminar topic for Week 10 and research like crazy, do a weekly summary for my vegie unit. And do a few readings. Phew! ^_^

And there was time to even browse at over-priced stationery. ^_^ And I may even be getting a job as a tutor for Yr 8-10 students while I'm here. I'm definitely returning to the life of a "Poor Uni Student" with great gusto. Which reminds me, I must get those Youth Allowance forms filled in. YUK!

      Just posted up photos of Menchi  finally .  &nbsp;  Time to post a link on  urlLink TheCatSite . It's time everyone got to see what my cats look like. I've been promising photos for so long. After a few failed attempts and false starts, I think that this will actually be successful. ^_^

      I'm moving in with my best buddy now. &nbsp; The people I'm staying with have nothing wrong with them. I just don't think I'll fit in. More later. &nbsp; And I can't get over the changes to Blogger!

      We're in Perth after a couple of days spent in Denmark. It's our last day together today for 6 months. Then one more week of settling in and then uni starts so that should keep me occupied.  Will post more later with pictures from Denmark.

      Had to reformat my laptop. I've got to reinstall Hello before I can upload photos of Menchi and get his blog up and running too.

      I've decided to do something about my work. I'm going to write a formal complaint and stop complaining. I am going to do something constructive.

      I made the wrong choice with which job to finish up with first before I left Hedland.  I should have finished up at the Pharmacy first, not the airport. I cannot believe that I thought working at the Pharmacy would be less tiring than the airport. It would had the current manager actually behaved as a manager.  Here's the Cliff's Notes.  Someone isn't performing their duties. I talk to the manager about it in an attempt to clarify the situation and to see how I'm supposed to interact with this person. I was told not to interact with this person despite 24 hours before that I was asked to train this person as they had not been trained before. This despite the claim that this person has worked in apharmacy before. I was also berated for making the complaint and was told to leave it alone.  Needless to say I am furious and not at all happy. I have sent detailed e-mails to the owners after each and every shift detailing what goes on in the pharmacy. The owners are sympathetic to my concerns and apologise each and everytime that they are on the phone to me, whether it be at the pharmacy or at home.  One of the owners is coming up next week. YAY!  Other good news: I have a place to stay in Perth and it's not with family. EVEN DUCKING BETTER!!!!

      Firstly, I'm going to try use the "Burger Theory" while writing this. Let's see how I go. *sigh*  Things went terrific yesterday morning. My shift at the airport went fantastically. It was a light flight so there wasn't too much baggage. Then it was off to the high school to join up with the  urlLink STARtrek Science Show  team at Hedland Senior High School. I joined up with the Physics session and never had more fun building bridges from straw and then testing their structures.  I had lunch with them all afterwards at the shopping centre after they bought food from where I would eat personally. ^_~ There are just some places where I simply don't reccommend.  And before I knew it, I was back at the airport for my final shift. I packed an amazing amount of bags into the hold. I was surprised as to how much I could fit into the hold. I will be returning the uniforms on Saturday instead of tomorrow. Work at the pharmacy is preventing that and today I'm feeling so drained.  And I'll launch into why I'm so drained.  I had ealier asked my mother whether it would be okay to move back into home in Perth to finish of my university degree. She said yes which was surprising considering I did move out after the ultimatum of "It's either your boyfriend, (now my fiancee), or family." and this was when the relationship was   long distance  . No surprise what I chose.  Anyhow, my mother hasn't mentioned anything of the move to my father. And she wants me to talk to my father about the move and see how he feels. Well I can already work this one out folks. My father has already said he doesn't want me in his life. He even told me that when I asked him straight out and he's even indifferent to the idea of my fiancee and I marrying. I suppose it is better than outright hostility. Anyway, I don't think my father will agree to me moving back home and even if he does, things will be made difficult. Frankly, I can do without all the hassles until after I graduate and even then I may not want to deal with it.  So now I'm waiting to hear back whether I am able to stay with a friend of my fiancee's. I hear back on Saturday. I'm not too optimistic about it to be honest but we'll see how things go before I hit panic stations even if it is only nine days before I leave Hedland.  I will graduate. I must.

      The university miraculously found my payment.  I live with crazy people. They go mad when the television doesn't work.  Not much more else to say.

      Just recieved a notice from uni today notifying me to pay approximately $50 of Ameneties Fees that I've already paid. Opening a can of whoop ass on Thursday. I can't do it tomorrow since it's full on with lectures and a four hour lab.  I'm looking forward to the lab. I'm analysing the caffeine content in tea, coffee, decaf coffee, and a sample of a drink of my own choice. My choice is Chocolate Mint Tea, something that had the lab technician wearing the "Oh, you're one of those students..." look on his face. :P

      At the end of the second week of uni, (one more lecture but it's still the end of Week 2), I'm finally felling tired. I'm still as enthusiastic as I was on Day One. I've got a bit to do this weekend.  Going over lectures from Week One and Two. Two lab write ups to start on for PEC249 Biomolecular Design. Discussion questions to complete for PEC340 Instrumental Analysis. One reading and a Weekly Summary for TLC277 From University to the Workplace. Guess which one is my vegie unit? ^_~  Actually, the vegie unit scares me. Not the workload or anything, but the numbers of soon to be graduates that do not have a clue as to how to get a job, some don't even know what job they would be qualified for. o_O Sure I may not be a great example when it comes to answering "What do you think you'll be doing next year?" but I have a goal and I know how to apply for the job I want and I've done research into it.  Bronwyn and Nathan go up to Geraldton today for the weekend. I get the place to myself with Brillo and the hermit crabs. Sammie is also going to Geraldton. (Sammie and Brillo are puppy dogs by the way.) I'll be spending most of my time studying.

      Well it's complicated but they have been chosen. I just don't think they're aware of what their exact titles yet. ^_~  The role of Maid of Honour goes to Bronwyn. There were a few Freudian slips from her before I even asked. It was amusing so I did let it drag on for a couple of days before officially asking her. Sure, I asked her to be bridesmaid, but she'll be Maid of Honour. She is married after all. But then Maid sounds old, so maybe Chief Bridesmaid instead.  The role of Best Man goes to Tim. The only slight little problem is that someone, namely the groom-to-be hasn't gotten around to asking him. We can't see him saying no. And he'd be great to have around on the day.

      The journey has begun. I've chosen my wedding dress. It will be red, a blending of East meets West. Sorry, no pictures until the day. (The date hasn't been set.) I'm not risking my fiancee having a look before the wedding. My best friend and I put our heads together and put ideas together resulting in the dress. Thank you chickie babe! I could not have done it without you.  We went to three bridal stores yesterday. Now, we did have an idea of what to expect. It was a Saturday. We hadn't made any appointments, but these stores do not require appointments. You would think staff would be happy to help and appear to be friendly. In two of the stores, the staff either ignored us, were unhelpful or downright rude, and one particular staff member managed to do all three!   urlLink Cupid's Bridal  was our first stop. This is the only store that I can reccommend. It was extremely busy in this store so it was quite understandable that no one approached us instantly and we were quite happy to look around. Despite being busy, staff members who were serving other bride-to-be's found time to say hello and to offer assistance when their customers were in the changing rooms.   urlLink Cupid's Bridal  does Made-to-Measure. They're open to all sorts of ideas, colour, cut, style, theme because they make the dresses. Fantastic to any bride-to-be who wants a personalised dress. I will be approaching this store to see if my dress can be made by them including dressmakers. We were even allowed to look at embroidery samples and encouraged to take them and to hold them against dresses around the store.  In HobNob, we did encounter one helpful and friendly staff member. Unfortunately, she was assisting with a bride-to-be. She was also open to ideas though the oriental factor did throw her a little. I do admit, it's not easy to find what I want. But she was able to show me a dress that had been done in red even though it wasn't a blending of cultures. We then went to walk around browsing.  It was here that we encountered the staff member that manage to ignore us. We approached her when I found a dress that caught my eye. I was told that it was not available in red and in the same beath, she said that she wasn't sure. It would be fair that she checked though isn't it? When it was made clear that I wanted a red dress and I wasn't compromising, only then did she check with another staff member.   And then when she came back to tell me that it was definitely not available in red, she proceeded to tell me that there were lots of shades of red, she could only name two, pillar box red and burgandy. Like I didn't know. I am the one looking for a red dress, and hello, I'm Chinese for crying out loud. We love red!  If that was not enough, she started to ask how much I was willing to spend. I replied that I was collecting quotes to see how much I had to spend on what I wanted. Then she cut me off by saying that dresses were around the $2,000 mark. Nevermind that I want something that she obviously couldn't cater for or that I wanted something that wasn't the norm. The only way that I could possibly fathom a budget would be collecting quotes on what I liked and then adding the cost of additions needed.  Unfortunately or fortunately, we did see a blue dress in the store above HobNob that had the perfect cut. Wrong colour but they can do it in red. I'll be checking whether they have any ties to HobNob before I spend a cent. I do not want any of my money going into HobNob's purse.  The third store isn't even worth mentioning. They were utterly useless. They didn't do Made-to-Measure. I don't hold this against them. However, the staff were unhelpful and talked down to me as if I didn't belong in there. I can't remember the name of the store at this stage.
