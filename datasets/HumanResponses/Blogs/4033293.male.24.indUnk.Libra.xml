        Have you ever looked at Ebay and then end up finding something you really wanted to buy? I was bored today and&nbsp;I was surfing the net and I just happen to end up at Ebay. Now I used to collect alot of things so coming here is usually a mistake, especially when I have cash. Oddly enough I didn't buy anything, but dang was I tempted. I wonder why most people are always compeled to buy things they don't really need, I mean all they are doing is wasting hard earned cash on something thats just going to sit in the closet or on top of a table and collect dust. Oh well who knows, but one thing for sure, next time I have some more extra cash,&nbsp;I think I&nbsp;might buy something off of Ebay, just for the hell of it, or maybe not, I don't know.......It's just been so long since I've bought anything for myself im debating it. Maybe if im lucky someone will buy&nbsp;something for me.......LOL, yeah right.

        urlLink     Jack Skellington Sketch&nbsp;  &nbsp;     I really like this pencil drawing of Jack, I think the reason why I like this character so much is the fact that like him I try to make things different when they are fine the way they are but honestly, who&nbsp; likes doing things the same way all the time? Certainly not me.

        Did you ever get ticked off at people because they were to darn stubborn about things? Earlier today I was trying to be nice to a person who I used to work with. I had stepped down as a manager of a online group due to the fact that many of the other workers of the site were to damn lazy to do any work and left me holding the bag, so obviously I said to hell with that and quit. As im talking to him it's obvious that he didn't really want to talk with me, but as I continued to talk to him in my mind I was thinking ::God, this guy is such a dick, here I go out of my way to be nice and strike up a conversation with him and he's trying to brush me off!:: so needless to say I wrapped up the conversation very quickly then went on with what I was doing online.       &nbsp;   I really do try to be nice to people, but the majority of them just seem to not give a crap about kindness. I've always lived by "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" but it seems since everyone has so much contempt towards everyone else that it's a stupid rule to live by. Sure people would claim that you should never let the actions of others change who you are, but when you are constantly barraged with negativity it's hard not to absorb some of it yourself. I notice that when I do manage to absorb some negativity I do the wrong thing and project it to others just like they did to me, so in the end im no better then the people who ticked me off in the first place. Oh well I guess ill try more harder to resist the trash that people send my way on a regular basis......which is easier said then done.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

         Well I don't know where to start really, lord knows I have alot to say but I guess ill have to ease into doing stuff like this. I started this blog just so that I could have a way to express myself without stepping on anyones toes, rather then talking to people that&nbsp;I might offend or drag them into a squabble that doesn't involve them just because I need someone to talk to. Anyways, im going to leave this as is for today, im to tired to write anything else.
