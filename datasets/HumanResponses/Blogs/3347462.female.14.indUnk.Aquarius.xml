      Its now about nie thirty AM and I couldnt get back to sleep for my sinuses kept me up. I am now gulping down some odd Natural Crunch cereal, even though it kind of tastes like shit. I has no sugar at all, and isnt crunchy (they  lie! they lie!) Anyway. Today I am going to Amberle*'s dog's party. What the hell's his name. Jeffery. Yah. Ok, well, yea. I hope Molly* can come over tonight. That'd be kool. Shelby's still here. Shes still snoring away. Oh well. Back to the Jon Peter Lewis site...   *Amberle- My friend up the street whos really short.  *Molly- My best friend who used to live across the street, goes to my school, and Ive known since I was three.

      Shelby, my cousin, is over. We were home alone and I am grounded from the compy. So, once my mom left for work, I got online. So, then, I got off and went to see what Shelby was doing. She was playing "Party Kitchen". (yea, even though she  is  twelve) So, she got out a play bisciut and filled it with water and squirted me with it. So we started a water battle. After, oh say, ten minutes the room was soaked. My step dad came in a minute later and we had covered the wet spots with blankets and said we watched a movie. Then my stepdad said, "Yea, youve been so good. Go online, its ok!" So, I got everything! WOW!!!!!!

      Well, I got up around 7:30, a half an hour later than I was supoosed to, and went to a flea market to get donations for the animal shelter. Stalker Boy* was there. Luckily, I had a black Japanese bandana over my head, veiling my face. So, I think that time he didnt notice me. Good. I started screaming when I saw him, but then I shut myself up. I need to work so Molly, my best quend (friend) can come over. I have to clean up the bathroom and I believe wash my hair. Oh well. I got some really koo japanese items. I got a statue of a dragon, my veiling bandana, and a fan. You know, one of the ones for decoration. Amberle, another quend, was there too. We walked aroung and ate soup. Yum, soup. Mmm...   *Stalker Boy: A boy in my class that stalks my friends and I.

      Another Friday night down the damn drain. I'm listening to an odd variety of downloaded music, some old Michael Jackson music, some Jon Peter Lewis (from American Idol), Hoobastank... You get the idea. At least I've got  something  to do. I had a dream about a week ago that I met all of the Idols and didn't realize it until the end but I was in love with JPL. I woke up and was like, "Naw, it was a dream... right ?" No. I am in  love  with Jon Peter. He's such a dork. An insane dork. Like me. Well, actually, they classify me as a freak. Ah well. I might go see the Idols in August. That would rock. I must get backstage passes!! Fwahahahahaha! I must meet JPL. Must. >>sigh

      God damn. I keep going on lovecalculator.com. At first I tried Me + JPL. It was like 85%. Of course Amberle's running against me for him so I tried Amber + JPL. 90. 90 FUCKIN percent. So, I tried Me + Malfoy (its codename for someone at my school) it was like 60%. So Amber + Malfoy- 91%. GOD DAMMIT WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME? Oh fuggin well. Oh and I was viciously attacked by cicadas.

      The movie wasnt as bad as I expected I guess. Then again, I am a tough critic. Im like a female Simon Cowell. "The movie was like cheescake..." "It was way too bloody happy." Yea, no guns. No black leather. Some tragedy, it reminded me of my life in a way. And it made me realize, yes, I am technically stil a child. Six more years of childhood too. And soon that will be taken and I will yearn for it back. But now, I  am  growing up. Im starting to be more independent, mature, and brave. Hm. I never thought about this. What should I do? If I was in The Giver by Lois Lowry, I would already have my life Assignment. Maybe I should try and train for some jobs, not pick one, cuz you know it depends on how the wind blows me, but just get started.

       Yawn.  I got home from school about one hour and fifteen minutes ago. Last night I helped Auun Patty, 49, make a Online Personals Column. Now, where did the torture numb and the terror began? Just for the few dense people who didnt get that-- It was dreadful. Anyway, Molly and I are starting to tap into to oue ESP. We are starting Wicca soon. So anyway, I just got out of the shower. Im freezing cold becuz my compy is right next to the AC. Well, I couldnt find shower gel so I used some old gift I found that was labeled 'Lazy Dayz Sugar Candy" and it smelled like shit. Well, I guess it was better than the BO I was getting. Oh, Bobbi Jo is coming in two weeks and staying through August 30. Wow. Yipee. That means I have...13 days to clean my room. And go to the mall. And finish school. So. Four days of school left. Tonight we're going to see Raising Helen. Oh joy. Another stupid movie about a rockstar inheriting her family's children. Whoo hoo. Hopefully, Molly can come so we can share the agony. Well, I must go find a shirt (Im in an undershirt now). Bon Voyage.
