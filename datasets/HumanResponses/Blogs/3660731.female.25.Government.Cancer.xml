      i might need to take a dump soon.  i am technically full of shit right now.  the seminar was short.  i didn't gain anything at all from it.  went in one ear, out the other.  we had lunch there.  Yatta came just before we left.  he chatted with us a little and during that he stood really close to me!!    boring works await this afternoon.  *sighs*  what's wrong with me?  when i'm at work i want to go home, but yesterday i had more time at home but was still bored.

      i'm attending the SMMS seminar at Kaset again, but it ends at noon today so i'll be back at the office again in the afternoon.  yesterday the seminar was over before 4 pm.  i arrived home before 5.  i was bored through that extra hour but i got to play fetch with Jumbo a bit.  at night before i switched off my mobile phone, i just noticed Pinn's miscall and her message saying to meet for dinner with her and Waroon somewhere near the seminar place (obviously she read the blog).  i totally missed that.  i blame my mobile.  seriously, i miss calls all the time cos i can't hear when it rings in my bag, and it just doesn't vibrate hard enough (oooh the last few words sound naughty).  i once set it on vibrating mode and put in my back pocket and still missed a call!  or was it because my butt is so big and the vibration couldn't get through to my nerves?  i want a new mobile, but i have to save up first.  besides, i should get a new one for my dad as well, and i'd feel guilty if don't get him a new one first before tending to my own need.  i mean, his mobile phone is falling apart!   fun fact:  i'm stalking this person 'tuppertina' from the tweaker board on the net.  haven't found anything interesting though.

      i write personal things in here.  it's not going to be pleasant.  it's not for everyone.  no one at my office except a few should know about the fact that i'm in the process of transfering to the Post and Telegraph Department, for instance.  if someone, say Ble, happens to be reading this, please not discuss it with myself in real life.  it'd be great if that someone thinks of this blog as whispers from fairies, and if he/she talks about fairies to ANYONE ELSE, he/she will be put in a mental institution to be treated with electric shock twice daily.  with that said, i'll try to keep this blog as honest as possible.  blogging is hard.  sometimes i want people to see it, to know what i'm all about.  then other times i want it to be real personal like the diaries i wrote and am planning to burn just so nobody could find out about them in case i drop dead or something.  but the purpose of having a web-log is to have it published for the world to see, right?  damn, i think i just confused myself.  i just had an idea!  i'll try to include fun fact with each post, starting with this one.  did you notice this paragraph didn't relate to the above ones at all?  hahaha!   fun fact:   i drafted this entry during the 9 am meeting.

      i didn't want to get up this morning.  thought it was gonna be a sleepy day, but i had a good time listening to Velvet Revolver on my way to the office.  the last song Loving the Alien is rather too cute for the band, hehehe!    i'll have to attend a meeting at 9 am.  at first i thought i'd go to Kasetsart University for a seminar in the afternoon then straight back home, but i'm hesitating now.  i just don't want to look for a parking space at KU, which i think would be difficult.  my back still hurts, but only a bit now when i move.

       urlLink Jenny Turpish Slapped Me: Quizzes - Better Personality    20 Questions to a Better Personality    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world.

      i meant to mention this earlier but kept forgetting.  i waxed my legs on sunday morning, using Booth's instant waxing stripes.  it's very convenient, but the result wasn't very satisfactory.  i think it rather tore the hair than pulled it, therefore my legs didn't very smooth.  i've used this waxing stripes for a few times now.  maybe i should stick to warm wax, or maybe i should just shave it?  goddamn i'm hairy like a gorilla.

      yes! and it's only a quarter pass 9!!  my notebook's battery was below 50% this morning.  there was no electricity when i plugged into my desk's sockets.  how was i suppose to work without electricity?  the entire row's electricity was out, and after morning update and email checking, my notebook's batt was running low.  i had to charge it at someone else's desk.  anyway, the electricity's back up now.  this month's salary slips have been distributed, and to our disappointment, we're still getting the old salary this month.  i should be receiving  9,xxx baht since April, instead i'm still getting the old 8,410 baht.  employees at other government organisations that i know of have all been receiving the new rate already.  why is our organisation so incredibly inefficient?  no electricity (at first), no new salary, this monday is too depressing.

      got the CD with souvenir on sunday!!  on sunday afternoon p Auey, p Yui and i went to Sirikitti Convention Centre for Elle (magazine) lifestyle fair.  it was much crowded with more booths than last year.  i renewed my subscribtion to the magazine (yes, as in disrepair as i look i actually read this fancy fashion magazine) then browsed the booths.  omm met us there.  i didn't get anything.  then we went to Zen cos p auey said they were having a sale.  i went up to CD Warehouse to get Velvet Revolver's CD.  it didn't come with dog tag though, just a cheap-looking keyring (i was thrilled anyway).  there were some problems with the CD though.  first, i notice the case was broken a bit so i asked for a new one, turned out they were all broken so they gave me the one with the least defect case.  then there was a paper sleeve that didn't fit (it should cover the case, but they made it too tight).  i managed to put the plastic CD case in the sleeve, but i couldn't get it out when i tried to appreciate my purchase in the car on the way home.  we all tried.  finally, omm pulled the plastic case and i pulled the paper sleeve simultanously and it came out.    i haven't finished the entire CD yet.  hope it'll grow on me in time cos frankly i wasn't so impressed upon the first listen.

      **i wrote this at home on sunday, but put in online on monday cos i didn't connect to the internet at home.  i made it so that the date and time of update appeared saturday night.**  i woke up when it was still dark, so i reached for my glasses to see the time.  after i saw that there some ten minuites before 5 am, i put my glasses near my pillow and tried to get some more sleep.  however, my glasses fell into the gap between my sister's bed and mine (we sleep in the same room, 2 single beds put next to each other).  i'm blind without my glasses so i had to find them right away.  took me several minutes too.  then i got downstairs to take a dump and then to my parents' bathroom to shower.  it was a bit pass 5 then.  then it came to me, as i tried to think about what to wear to work while carrying on my daily routine, that it was FRIGGIN SATURDAY.  no work!  just as well, we had to leave for my cousin's monkhood entrance ceremony at 6 am, but still i could have had up to 30 minutes more of sleep!  it mattered!  the first day of my period started today.  i felt so sick and tired.  fell asleep for 3 hours, got up around 3 pm and took 3 parecetamol, then back to sleep.  i felt much better when i got up at 5.30 pm, then we (my family minus mum who was out of town, and my aunt's family) had dinner at MK Sukiyaki, Jaransanitwong.  after that i went to Central Pinklao with p Auey, p Yui and Khun Pa to buy Slash's CD.  most shops didn't store it.  one shop said they were just sold out and the new batch is arriving on Wednesday!  i coudn't believe how hard it is to buy CDs these days!!  there used to be a Tower Record at Central Pinklao, but it went out of business.  now i only have B2S and a few small shops as my source for CDs.  why isn't there a good record store near my neighborehood?  i hate to travel to Siam Square area just to get CDs because of the traffic, parking space problem and people.  i hate crowded places.  so, no Velvet Revolver CD today.  the salesperson at one shop said the first batch of CDs came with souvenir metal dog tags, and he wasn't sure if it'd go the same for the second batch of CDs.  what if i can't get this dog tag thing?!?  DISASTROUS!!!!!!!

      i can just feel it.  at least 5 pimples on my face since yesterday, and this morning slow drivers seemed to piss me off more easily.  i even honked at one of them.  it's friggin thursday today.  i normally prefer the first days of my period to be weekdays, cos the activities involved would be easier to organised.  last night i had this exciting/scary/suspense movie sort of dream.  it was set in a cool dark gothic castle around the cold war period and it involved horses, spies, murder, secret code hidden in a riddle and a character (turned out he was the killer) who looked like a combination of actors Jim Caviezel and Joseph Fiennes.  i remember quite a lot about it, but it's hard and complicated to write in english and it doesn't even make sense now.  after that dream i woke up.  it was pretty scary cos i cracked the code and found out what was really going on, and the killer tried to kill me with a gun, and i begged him not to kill me and said "i'm not a spy! i nver wanted to act like a spy!" ooooooooohhh quite a dramatic scene there.  then i had another dream about going to Dallas, Texus with my family minus dad.  we were walking in a building, and somehow we weren't in Dallas anymore but in Hong Kong.  heh.  in real life, my sister is preparing to further her study in Texus.  i've never been to USA or Hong Kong myself.  this has been the busiest week since March, but Saturday's coming soon!

      how come some people have a lot of time to do stuff, but some people just can't find the time to do anything?  i want to be able to do the following things : paint with water colours, play more instruments like bass and chello, read/write/speak German... that's just about it i guess.  i don't even practise guitar these days. and i have had a small set of water colours for a few years now, but haven't yet started to paint.  did i mention i had a side job to finish?  i got my set of water colours on discount while i was still studying in England.  i was listening to Rammstein's Mutter during that period, just got really into them too, and the song Nebel made me want to paint a picture of a shore or a misty beach, so misty that you can't seperate water from the sky.  i'd call that picture "Wo das Mere zu ende ist (where the sea ends)" which is a line from the song's lyrics.  you see, i've had the picture's theme and name ready for years now, but not the skill to produce it.  i don't think i'd attend a painting class any soon either, i've just started to learn thai astronomy.  i guess i should make my thai astronomy skill work first before starting on other things.  this is a list of extra-curriculum stuff i took and am taking (that i can remember): - swimming, sensibly enough of my parents - art programme for kids during summer vacation.. i think i attended 2 summers.  my mum was working next to the national art chamber then. - classic guitar (once a week for 5 years) - thai bass fiddle (2 months - summer vacation thing my mum asked me to do) - Spanish (a few months - i thought i was gonna get a master degree in Spain then) - thai astronomy (once a week since May, 2004) that's probably it. other out-of-school academic courses to help improve the grades and get me into university shouldn't count, right?  i took an english course for taking GRE exam (which i didn't take) at SLS school (Sangoun) and i'm proud of that.  the course has proved to be very beneficial to my overall English skill.  boss is away again this morning.

      i like how i drove to work today.  there were a few retard drivers (those who drive like my aunt and, these days, my mum also) that got in my way, but i overtook them all with ease.  yesterday afternoon i was very busy trying to deal with escrow agreement, iPSTAR gateway and draft regulations for street traffic court at the same time.  there was also another work but i tried to forget about it (information on communication satellite policy to send to south african government).  as busy as i was, i felt somewhat refreshed and active, probably cos i hadn't done a real job for a big while.  my passenger (p Jim+) and i left the office at around 6 pm.  luckily, the traffic was quite light and i arrived home before 7 pm.  i didn't play with Jumbo at all yesterday!!!  there is a side job i'm supposed to be finishing already.  i'm helping a colleague (p Goy) translating a childern's book called Loser.  by now i only finished 3 chapters from 11.  bad me, bad!!!  it's only 7.20 am now. maybe i'll work on it a bit before office hour starts.

      yesterday our maid Jasmin (Mali in Thai) prepared ingredients for me to fix spicy tuna salad for dinner.  she only prepared one can of tuna.  not underestimating consumption capacity of the members of my family, i looked for more tuna.  there was none left!!  how could that be!!  who ate all the fuckin tuna!!  if i had known there was just 1 can left, i would have had stocked more.  that's a sensible thing to do, right?  apparently whoever nearly deplenished our tuna supply didn't care enough to stock it back up.  damn i was mad.  no one (of my two siblings) admitted said negligence, but i should make it clear here that my brother is THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.  that bastard.  today i was busy working since before 7 am.  finished one urgent (yet stupid/easy) task by 10.00.  some person i was supposed to deal with hadn't even arrived the office.  damn stupid, lazy-ass, old-skool government employees...  my lower back still hurts today.

       urlLink the spark's  personality test result (you have to register first these days)    You are an Experimenter! (Dominant Introverted Abstract Thinker)  You are an EXPERIMENTER (DIAT). Although you're slightly shy (admit it!), you love control. When a problem comes across your way, you stomp on it swiftly and decisively. You are bothered easily by failure in others and failure in yourself. You don't like people that you don't think are intelligent. Rather than arguing with them, however, you would just as soon ignore them altogether.   In relationships, you have a strong heart. And because you're introverted, people take you as someone they can trust. But the fact is that in addition to solving problems, you like to create them.   You're a good person at heart, but then again, who isn't?

      on saturday i went to study thai astronomy at PetchKasem 79 witm mum.  we stopped by at the clothesmaker's earlier but it was close. i want new clothes!!  dad was a bit petulant (according to mum) on sunday cos nobody went to OTOP SME fair and visit grandmother with him.  i myself managed to come downstairs just before noon.  my sister omm came back from a 2-day self-motivation programme in the afternoon and told us about it.  it cost 2000 baht per person and there were like 3,700 people there!!  actually, p Auey was supposed to go with Khun Pa (my aunt, the person who was initially interested in the programme) but said she was busy (heh) so omm replaced her.  according to omm, Khun Pa was pretty impressed.  omm admitted the programme wasn't completely useless, but we all agreed no one should pay 2,000 bath for 2 days with no lunch (yes, no lunch!  they just had booths that sold their own products!!!) just to have some persons telling you to shout "yes we can!" out loud.  i fucking hate that shit.  so it's monday again.  i had a meeting in the morning.  Taan' was there.  he's so old.  i think today my back hurts a bit more...

      i'm updating this from home.  yesterday's interview went well.  we (p Goy, p Jim+ and i) were interviewed seperately.  the director of the department wasn't available so we got 3 level-8 officers conducting the interview instead.  basically they just told us about the nature of job there, to see if we were still confident to transfer.  previously there were 4 of us who submitted the transfer form (3 of us today plus p Ging), but p Ging changed her mind due to travelling difficulties.    after this we just wait for the formal letter from Post and Telegraph Department (the place we're transfering to) to MICT.  it could take months before we actually go to work at PTD.    the PTD itself isn't very interesting in my idea, but the organisation is on it's way to becoming Telecommunication Committee Office, which is an independent organisation (as oppose to a governmental organisation).  that makes it (probably only a bit) more private-organisation oriented with higher salary but less job security and welfare.  once PTD becomes TCO (Gor Tor Chor, in thai abbrev.) they have to set the ceiling for telecommunication services' prices as well, and that's what we think sorta interesting.   after i got home yesterday i played with Jumbo.  i bent down and lifted her off the floor and BAM!  a sharp pain in my back.  just yesterday i read the horoscope in Matichon weekly newspaper and it said "don't lift heavy things"!!  actually i wouldn't say Jumbo is heavy, she's only about 17-18 kg and i carry her all the time.

      for some reason, the entire building's electricity went off about an hour ago.  exciting!!  technically, i could still work since i work on my own laptop and it has battery backup, but why would i do that?  hahahaha!!  i just wandered off and had a chat with a few people then proceded to the cafeteria for an early lunch.  the cafeteria was crowded cos people didn't know where to go.  it was also dark there, but some shops had candles lit.  oooh romantic!  during the blackout, the execs were having the routine weekly meeting upstairs.  the meeting wasn't disrupted at all.  guess they had reserve/emergency lighting.  luckily, it was raining hard outside, otherwise it would have been very hot in herre (in the building, i mean).  the electricity's just been back.  i'm sad.

      today i arrived the office at 6.30 am... plenty of time to progress my ff8 story.  yesterday i managed to refine the last energy crystal and remodel quistis's weapon.  next aim: fighting omega weapon!  last night i had a dream.  i was about to go abroad but remined at the last minute that i forgot my passport.  does it have anything to do with me having an interview this afternoon?   p Jim+ and i need to tell our boss (p Tubb, the director) about this interview.  hope he won't be too pissed.  we already told p ma'am and she wholeheartedly encouraged us to go.  i love my Space Affairs Bureau, but seriously, i sorta despise Ministry of Information and Communication as a whole.  mainly because it's  dumb  and  arrogant  (setting high standards for new recruits, only to have them leave to work some place else with higher salary and more promising career path).  i mean, wtf?  they specifically asked for new employees with master degree from abroad!  i think that's very dumb.  besides, more than half of the people who graduated abroad's english skill is what i would say appalling!  yeah!!  i don't know many people who graduated master degrees from abroad and choose to work for the government at their own will like myself.  i mean, the salary is not nearly worth the cost of education.  a lot of my colleagues with masters from abroad just work here cos their parents tell/ask them too.  of course, their personal expenses will be subsidised by the parents.  those with more parental independency go to work in the private sector which pays new recruits as high as 5 times of what the government pays.    gah, it's already 7.30 am!

      that hawt man, dr.pratit santipraphop just left our building.  p maew called to inform me that he's still SINGLE OMG!!! prior to this i thought he had a 5 year old daughter or something.  p maew is getting friendly with his 27 year old female assistant (whom i hope will not become anything further than "assistant"), so maybe more information on this hawt dude coming soon!  it's so pathetic to outsource even just eye candies, isn't it?    lazy ghost have possessed me since weeks ago.  i am now even lazier.  all i wanna do is playing games and petting my baby Bobo.  sooooooooo uninspired.  i guess this is the last entry for today.  the first day's start is pretty well i think.  maybe i'll have serious, deep entries some day.  *sighs*    thanks go 4 people (at most) who read this!  bye bye!

      can't believe how fast this week has been.  yesterday the committee was supposed to report their work to the deputy permanent secretary, but the chairman wouldn't sign the paper cos she wanted some explanation on something not so relevant.&nbsp; bitch.&nbsp; the report must go to head of fiscal and purchasing department then to the deputy, and at 5 pm she still wouldn't sign.&nbsp; most officers in the fiscal and purchasing bureau had gone already gone home (head of the department was still working though).  i could have gone home at the usual 4.30 pm, but i had to wait around and lobby officers&nbsp;around the office to help make it happen within the day (or at least seem like it happened on the day).&nbsp; then i just told director i wanna go home and he said he'd take care of it, so i left the office at 5.30 pm.&nbsp; the traffic was rather light so i arrived home before 6.30 pm.  regarding ICT Expo, a lot of things need to happen today.&nbsp; although my part is over (supposedly), i might still have to stay overtime to help with other things.&nbsp; this morning i have to go to Kite university for a meeting on the Space Affairs Masterplan Seminar.&nbsp; i used to study there and it feels weird to go back there again, like it used to be my place but now it's not anymore.  yesterday a couple of the bureau's&nbsp;admin officers went to the apartment where p Nuch lives cos p Nuch hasn't been to work for consecutively 15 working days already and that's considered serious offence.&nbsp; they didn't find p Nuch, but her sister who said p Nuch left to work at 5-6 am everyday and usually came back at noon or 2 pm.&nbsp; what the fuck!?!? didn't the sister know that office hour for Thai government is 8.30 am - 16.30 pm?&nbsp; then how can a Thai government officer go back from work at noon!?!?!?!&nbsp; p Nuch has a problem, and probably this sister of hers is in denial.&nbsp; just as well cos the sister herself doesn't seem like a dependable person (she doesn't work and was just sleeping when the bureau's officers arrived there, eventhough it was noon already).&nbsp; how can these people expect others to just hand them help?  after that, the sister called director p Tubb on his mobile to consult, and p Tubb just told her to tell p Nuch to come to the office already cos if she just quits by herself she might get some welfare and pension, but if she's fired she would be deprived of such rights.  i'm worried about the bureau.&nbsp; except p Nuch, the most senior officers who are not director or head of groups are p Jim+, Ble&nbsp;and i, and we've only been working here for less than 2 years (not to mention that p Jim+ and i&nbsp;are leaving).&nbsp; if p Nuch is fired and&nbsp;p Jim+ and i leave, there would be only 3 analysts left.&nbsp; they should be recruiting more people by now.  Saturday and Sunday are religious holidays, but the government allows 1 compensation holiday on Monday only.

      i spend 10 minutes to put on lipstick exactly how i like it.&nbsp; that's probably too long.&nbsp; must practice to do it faster.   yesterday my family and relatives had dinner to celebrate Omm's departure&nbsp;to Texus.&nbsp; i didn't go.&nbsp; i left the office at 7.10 pm and didn't feel like rushing to the restaurant so i just went home.&nbsp; i wasn't in the mood to go anyway cos my period came (can one has PMS on the first day of her period? cos i do).   today's work constraint: have to acquire signatures from the committee before lunch.&nbsp; i seriously hope they will all be at the office today.&nbsp;  last night i had a strange dream.&nbsp; at first it was about the bureau's officers, like we were working but not at the office.&nbsp; then i was like i was a high school/university student again.&nbsp; it was during a field trip lead by King Rama IX.&nbsp; the trip was about poverty problems and sustainable economy.&nbsp; after he gave me and other students a tour around the exhibition, he asked if anyone had questions.&nbsp; i raised my hand and asked something about the cycle nature of poverty and how to tackle poverty effectively.&nbsp; the radio woke me up before i even finished my question.  it was unnerving, having dreams about the present King of Thailand.&nbsp; maybe this means good luck?&nbsp; but i couldn't help thinking, if the radio hadn't wake me up, i'd probably know how to tackle poverty in Thailand!

      i have 8 assignments on my hand right now!&nbsp; i've just realised it!&nbsp;   the workload is getting out of hand because Ble and p Aiw are both in China and p Nuch just fucking decides to disappear.&nbsp; there're only 4 junior analysts left!  i'm really mad at p Nuch, cos the ICT Expo work was originally assigned to her and p Singh.&nbsp; p Nuch had gone AWOL before but she claimed later that she suffered chronic depression.&nbsp; depression my ass!&nbsp; she just stopped coming to work again just when the workload was getting heavier!!&nbsp; she said it herself one day,&nbsp;after knowing they needed someone to explain Expo budget in an afternoon&nbsp;meeting, that she'd take a half-day leave.&nbsp; we thought she was joking, but she really left!!&nbsp; actually i'm mad at p Singh too, but it's not really his fault.&nbsp; he's the newest officer and obviously not experienced enough to handle the task alone.&nbsp; it's ironic that p Nuch is the most experienced, but also most unreliable.  yesterday was another day of leaving the office late.&nbsp; i drafted the report, gave it to p Ma'am to check and waited for her so we could finalise it and attach appropriate documents.&nbsp; but p Ma'am was so busy plus she had to help with other important documents, so we left the office at 6.30 pm.&nbsp; the traffic was so bad last night  i went to bed very late for weekdays cos i was watching  the joy luck club  and other programmes on tv.&nbsp; chinese people are so traditionally&nbsp;dumb and&nbsp;oppressive.&nbsp; i'm glad my parents brought us up the modern, somewhat liberal way.&nbsp; it was probably 1 am when i went to bed, and i had to got up again at 5.10 am.&nbsp; i'm feeling a little queasy right now probably because of that.&nbsp; or because i have to take a crap, i don't know.

       wiggle your big toe...   on Saturday i went to study Thai astronomy at the temple instead of the teacher's house, then i went with my dad&nbsp;to register foreign labours at the labour office.&nbsp; we have a burmese girl and my aunt's house has 2 but dad always takes care of their registration.&nbsp; we took the dogs for a run in the back garden after we got home.&nbsp; mum left for Chiangrai in the morning.  on Sunday afternoon&nbsp;Omm and i went to pick mum up from the airport.&nbsp; it was raining and we saw a lot of car accidents along the way.&nbsp; there was one accident where there were like 6 or 7 cars involved!&nbsp; we had to wait for mum for quite a while eventhough it said on the monitor that the plan arrived 5 minutes earlier.&nbsp; the traffic was bad on the way home and i was really hungry!&nbsp; in the evening we watched  catch me if you can  on HBO.&nbsp; it was quite enjoyable.  i had a lot of emotions on Monday.&nbsp; first, i really didn't want to go to work but i had too cos there was a meeting at 4.30 pm.&nbsp; i talked to head of group (p Ma'am) and director and they basically told me about the current situation, their concern and&nbsp;what should be done.&nbsp; that helped me a bit.&nbsp; then i was really depressed cos i had to invite the committee to the meeting but the appointment of the committee hadn't been issued until 3 pm and the company hadn't given us their proposal until 4 pm.&nbsp; but after the ministry issued the appointment of the committee, my main trouble was gone and i thought i was quite ready for the meeting.&nbsp; of course i was being optimistic.&nbsp;   both&nbsp;documents from the ministry and the company were crap.&nbsp; however, p Ma'am helped doing some explaining and an agreement was reached so it wasn't a useless meeting.&nbsp; i felt so bored and tired during the meeting.&nbsp; i couldn't really focus and the director had to remind me to take notes.&nbsp; the meeting finished at 7.30 pm.  today i have to work on&nbsp;yesterday's meeting&nbsp;report.&nbsp; at least i don't have to wait for things to happen so that i can do my work anymore today.  i'm feeling weird in my head, like i'm gonna have a headache but not quite yet.&nbsp; hope it doesn't get worse.

      it's difficult not to think about going to jail when you're a government officer working on a 51.35 million baht worth, half-assedly planned project.&nbsp; but i'm just a lowly level 4 officer, so maybe i can do what i'm told and let the seniors take the blame if the worst should happen.  i have to arrange a meeting at 4 pm today.&nbsp; hope the traffic will be light by the time we finish.  yesterday i left the office at about 4.10 pm, expecting to arrive home around 5 pm.&nbsp; but the traffic somewhat seemed horrible than normal and i arrived home at&nbsp;5.35 pm.&nbsp; we left the house to meet&nbsp;dad's friend&nbsp;who's visiting from Texus (dad hopes he'd help look after Omm when she goes to study).&nbsp; jesus.&nbsp;we had to drive almost as far as Saraburi!&nbsp; we got lost for a while too, and mum and dad were bickering about whether we already went pass the place or not.&nbsp; finally we arrived at dad's friend's place at 8 pm then we all went to have lunch at a restaurant we'd already driven&nbsp;pass twice.&nbsp; Erb drove us home and we arrived home at 10.45 pm, much sooner than i had thought.  there's a lot of work today.&nbsp; must focus!

      director just called and had a yell at me.&nbsp; what the fuck?!?&nbsp; i'm sure i did everything that's supposed to be done according to the conversation i had with him early this morning!   i really do feel bad for him.&nbsp; poor guy.&nbsp; he probably got yelled at by the superiors earlier.&nbsp; he didn't really yell at me or call me names. &nbsp;he just seemed very upset, so i&nbsp;apologised&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; oh, the crap we have to put up with for just&nbsp;stinkingly low salary!  because i had to admit to something i wasn't supposed to do, i'm leaving the office at 4 pm today!!&nbsp; well it's really because my dad called and said the family's going to have dinner with his friend this evening and i don't want to be left behind.

      yesterday afternoon, director assigned a work to me.  the ministry is holding Bangkok International ICT Expo 2004 during 4-8 August, which is less than 2 weeks away.&nbsp; first i thought i wouldn't have anything to do with it since the tasks were assigned to 2 other officers, but there are still many things to do so p Tubb enlisted helps from several more officers.&nbsp; they're drafting a ministry order to set up hiring committee (we're hiring a company to take care of the Expo) with me as a secretary.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; there are risks that i might go to  jail  because of this.&nbsp; and there are still other works to do, including cover for Ble!  strangely enough, last night i had a dream.&nbsp; the entire bureau officers and director's wife were at a hospital because director needed a brain surgery urgently (brain cancer or something serious).&nbsp; it was a life-threatening situation and we all wondered if he was gonna make it.&nbsp; for some reason, while the doctor performed the operation, we had to go to the prison to talk to someone.&nbsp; the prison was very big with tall gallant outer wall.&nbsp; after we entered the gate, we had to go to the information desk and they gave us id tags to put on while inside the prison.&nbsp; after that, the sequence was cut and we were back in the hospital again.&nbsp; the doctor informed us that director p Tubb survived the surgery and he was probably gonna make it after all, then he showed me a large chunk of brain he took out from director's head.&nbsp; it was all black and rotten.  i tried to look for the meaning of my dream after i arrived the office this morning, but the closest term i could find was "boss", saying if someone dreams of seeing his/her boss, there will be more work to do.&nbsp; too right, this one.&nbsp; actually, i think i have an idea why i dreamt what i dreamt last night.&nbsp; director p Tubb has a lot of things to take care off lately, and this ICT Expo is obviously pushing his limit.&nbsp; i guess i worry about him.&nbsp; and we&nbsp;joked about going to jail because of ICT Expo at the office yesterday, so that's probably why i dreamt of prison. heh.  &nbsp;  fun fact: &nbsp; i've read somewhere that if you have a dream where someone close to you&nbsp;is&nbsp;in great peril or dies or has an accident, it just means that you care about him/her.&nbsp; the following people are those i had such dreams about: my sis Omm, my dog Dada, my cousin p Auey, and my boss Director p Tubb.

       86-87: 7 years old   second grade.&nbsp; we had this teacher who swayed when she walked, and i thought she look frightening cos she wore a lot of makeup.&nbsp; actually, she was as nice and kind as a teacher could be.&nbsp; i had a best friend and we played together.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there was one time i had a strange, misterious allergy.&nbsp; i had to stay home a few days, visit a couple of hospitals and had my blood taken for testing a few times.&nbsp; they tried everything from changing my diet to changing my mattress, still couldn't find out what i was allergic to.&nbsp; finally, i got better by myself. &nbsp; &nbsp; on the second term my grades got noticeable worse.&nbsp; i guess the teacher consulted my parents cos one day dad told me to stand at a distance from the calendar and asked me if i could see the numbers.&nbsp; i couldn't.&nbsp; i got glasses that summer before 3rd grade. &nbsp;   &nbsp;  87-88: 8 years old  3rd grade.&nbsp; i wore glasses to school and some kids didn't remember me at first.&nbsp; my best friend moved to another province so i had a new best friend, a tom boy one.&nbsp; this one had a lot of things in common with me ie. we both saw the same movie and i thought (at the time) that it was brilliant.&nbsp; there were a few new boys, one of them was my first crush.&nbsp; he was very smart and, unlike other 8 year old kids, he was cool.&nbsp; there was a period that he sat next to me and the teacher teased us cos our names rhymed.&nbsp;   one day i crapped my underpants while the teacher was away because i didn't know who to ask for permission to go to the toilet.&nbsp; hehe i was such a tight kid.&nbsp; it was awful.&nbsp; the teacher had to find me a gym pants to wear home.&nbsp; there is a moral to this story: because i was sorta 1337 (good grades, cool friends, etc), the story got twisted and soon the classmates thought it was the other (poor) kid who did the crapping.&nbsp; cool people can't go wrong, hahaha!&nbsp;    88-89: 9 years old  4th grade.&nbsp; we got a new fancy teacher.&nbsp; i remember the supreme patriarch died this year and all govenment employees had to wear black for a week to mourn, and this teacher of ours wore different black dresses for the entire week.&nbsp;   i started to get lazy this year (it could be earlier but this is as far as i remember).&nbsp; i didn't do most homework and got punished for it.&nbsp; i hated when i was being punished, but that it didn't make me want to do homework.&nbsp; somehow i just didn't think about homework at all when i was at home, hahaha!&nbsp; my grades were okay so laziness wasn't really an issue i guess.&nbsp; and i got chickenpox this year too.   my mum told me to carry a sanitary napkin to school in case i got my first period (which i didn't until the start of 7th grade).&nbsp; my friend and i dissect it after school cos we wanted to know what was inside that made these things so miraculously absorbent.&nbsp; also, my crush brought the class some pet fish.&nbsp; when one of them died, my friend and i buried it in the school yard then we tried to resurrect it the day after but we couldn't find it anywhere! spooky!  &nbsp;   89-90: 10 years old  5th grade.&nbsp; my best friend and i became close to this new kid from 3rd grade.&nbsp; he was sort of a queer/asexual kid with great artistic talent.&nbsp; so their i was, between a tomboy and a queer.   our homeroom teacher picked me among 7 other girls to represent the school in some national red cross girlscout camping activity.&nbsp; it was fun cos we got to skip classes in favour of dance rehearsal (we had to perform hillbilly tribe dance and the costume was so stupid).&nbsp; the actual camping activity was fun too.&nbsp; my queer friend and i also represented the school in an inter-school science quiz.&nbsp; we won 3rd place, no thanks to my lack of ability to hit the bottom fast enough.   some girls were growing fast.&nbsp; i used to be the tallest or second tallest girls, but this year i was the 4th or 5th.&nbsp; one girl who cried a lot (i didn't like her) told me she had pubes.&nbsp; one day we had a fight and i yelled in her face "you have pubic hair!" so she ran off and told the teacher i called her name.&nbsp; the teacher called me and asked what i said.&nbsp; i told her the exact words.&nbsp; i was surprised that the teacher didn't seem angry at all, she just laughed.&nbsp; come to think of it, it was kinda funny, hahaha!   this year we discovered that our homeroom teacher hated the home ec teacher.&nbsp; the realisation that teachers weren't so righteous hit me hard.  &nbsp;   90-91: 11 years old  6th grade, final year of elementary school.&nbsp; my queer friend and i didn't get to represent the school in the inter-school science quiz anymore cos we didn't win the intra-school quiz.&nbsp; for some reason i was in the school debate team.&nbsp; we sucked bad when debating with other schools, hahaha.&nbsp; the only time we won was when the other school didn't show up.   my teacher picked other kids and myself to participate in Tawarawadee English Camp (Tawarawadee was a group of schools that our school belonged to).&nbsp; she asked for my opinion about who should be the last kid on the team.&nbsp; i felt special.&nbsp; i nominated my queer friend but she said he was too much of a sissy to represent the school (that's not what she said but it kinda translated into it).   most kids had to prepare for the entrance exam to get into secondary schools, so they studied hard.&nbsp; i didn't.&nbsp; my mum was gonna put me in the Lotus school where she used to study, using alumnae quota.&nbsp; however, most kids from my school had a try at a local teaching demonstration school (this school had 2 rounds of exam and the first round was much earlier than other schools).&nbsp; there were like thousands of kids who wanted to have a try at an secondary school entrance exam, but the school only accepted 90 students.&nbsp; my crush and i were one of the few students from our school who got accepted. mum gave me 100 baht reward.&nbsp; meanwhile, my final GPA was ranked no.12 from usually no.4-6.

       rant i talked about yesterday: &nbsp;  on sunday before we went to see Spiderman 2, p Auey bitched about going to a wedding and having to pay some money as a token to the couple.&nbsp; p Auey and i knew the bride from when we were in Bristol but i can honestly say we're not close.&nbsp; the bride gave p Auey the invitation just cos she had to called p Auey to ask for Pong's address.&nbsp; Pong and p Auey are very close (but Pong alone is close to the bride), so they were going to the wedding together.&nbsp; now, Pong's family is filthy rich and they give their daughter unlimited allowance while p Auey has 13,xxx monthly salary plus 5,ooo from parents and she barely survives each month (she always has to ask for extra cash from her dad without her mum knowing).&nbsp; clearly she can't afford Pong's lifestyle.&nbsp; however, they hang out all the time, probably because p Auey's other friends are busy acting their age (31, Pong is 24), focusing on their career and family or whatever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  anway, p Auey was bitching about having to give 1,000 baht to the bride and groom.&nbsp; p Yui, Omm and I thought it was too much and that 500 should be okay.&nbsp; but p Auey said Pong was also giving 1000 baht and it was such a big and luxurious wedding and that she was gonna ask for some money from her dad but he was away.&nbsp; then she went on bitching about what dress to wear, what shoes, she didn't want to wear long dress, etc.&nbsp; who cared??&nbsp; seriously, if it was&nbsp;too much trouble, just stay home!!&nbsp; but after giving our two pence on the appropriate token money, no one said anything else.&nbsp; she still went to the wedding in the evening.  &nbsp;  her behaviour bothered me so much.&nbsp; she's 31, but can't think for herself?!?&nbsp; what's up with that?&nbsp; why would she think everybody cares about her personal trivial matters?&nbsp; what more, being 31 and still receiving allowance? i'm probably jealous that she has more to spend, but i am very proud of myself because i can manage to live on my own salary and still be able to save.&nbsp; really.&nbsp; a 31 year old should be more responsible than that.&nbsp; then again, this is the person who spent 8 friggin years in the UK and got nothing but a stinkin postgrad diploma.&nbsp;&nbsp;i never hear her sister p Yui complain about anything, the trouble with her studying, choice of career, money, anything, but i have to endure all this from p Auey.&nbsp; p Yui gets even less monthly salary than p Auey (p Yui also works for the govenment).&nbsp; no doubt she&nbsp;gets extra cash from her dad too but at least she doesn't make a big deal out of it.&nbsp; p Yui is clever enough not to buy 2&nbsp;high-end facial products in&nbsp;one month using her mum's Central Card.&nbsp; p Auey, on the other hand, can't really restrain herself and ends up having her mum nag about it, which she would get angry and say that she won't ask for anything from her mum and dad again (ha!).&nbsp; how childish.  &nbsp;  yeah, i was talking her behaviour bothered me so much that i didn't tell her i already received Sisley's facial massage coupons from my friend.&nbsp; when i first told her that my friend was gonna send me some coupons, she just assumed immediately that i'd give her one.&nbsp; anyway, there are 2 coupons, so i figured i'd ask my sis first if she wanted to go.&nbsp; or my mum.&nbsp; hehehe, i am, among other things,&nbsp;snob intolerant!

      yesterday i attended a meeting about potential development on HR management on behalf of director.&nbsp; to my surprise, it was actually interesting.&nbsp; i had thought previously that the execs were blind to the fact that good people don't tend to last in this ministry but i had been wrong.&nbsp; they knew, they just didn't do something about it.&nbsp; hahaha!&nbsp; anyway, the admin bureau was supposed to be working on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; the permanent secretary spoke highly of p Don in the meeting, saying that he was some sort of indisposable officer or something.&nbsp; i asked p Don afterwards if PS knew about him leaving and he said yes.&nbsp; hehe, giving praises now is a little too late, auntie!&nbsp; she used to scold him and call him fat during the meeting for fuck's sake. &nbsp;  &nbsp; i had a breif talk about my transfer with the ministry's&nbsp;consultant who is in charge of personnel.&nbsp; she said the transfer was not gonna be earlier than October.

      yeah, i got up late this morning and left home 20 mins later than usual.&nbsp; just arrived the office at 7.25 am, 50 mins later than usual!&nbsp; this is why i prefer arriving the office too early; getting stuck in the traffic for extra half an hour is no fun. &nbsp;  quick weekend update:  on Saturday i went to study Thai astrology with mum.&nbsp;&nbsp;next week mum will be away so i'll have to study alone and the teacher said there'd be a test!&nbsp; i still can't remember&nbsp;Mahachakra and&nbsp;Rajachoak star positions!&nbsp; in the evening we (our family minus Erb cos he went to Bangsaen) had some japanese to kinda celebrate my birthday, then we went to Pata cos dad wanted to buy jeans for his trip to the US with Omm. &nbsp; on Sunday p Auey, p Yui, Omm and i went to see Spiderman 2 at The Mall.&nbsp; this sequel is actually good (i fell asleep during Spiderman 1 at the theatre, seriously).&nbsp; poor, poor spidy!&nbsp; i also bought Kill Bill vol.1 dvd which i watched&nbsp;after i got home.&nbsp; good action stuff.&nbsp; in the evening i cut dad's hair and he complained that it wasn't even in the back, that i cut off too much at some spots.&nbsp; well it wasn't easy!&nbsp; i'm not a professional hair dresser/barber! &nbsp; i actually have something to rant about&nbsp;regarding sunday.&nbsp; i'll save it for later. &nbsp; also, p Aiw and Ble (my colleagues) left for a 2-week&nbsp;training programme in China on Sunday.&nbsp; i totally forgot to call and wish them luck.&nbsp; hehe, that's the kind of person i am.

      my colleagues&nbsp;bought me&nbsp;lunch at Seefah Restaurant to celebrate my birthday.&nbsp; they even bought me cake.&nbsp; that was very nice of them, but i really don't like people whom i'm not that close to buying me meals&nbsp;and things.&nbsp; they only make me feel bad when i fail to return the kindness, and frankly, i tend to do so.&nbsp; i'm just not the type of people who remember birthdays&nbsp;or bother finding gifts etc.&nbsp; really, a birthday's just a day, isn't it?&nbsp; sometimes it doesn't seem special at all even for the birthday person him/herself.&nbsp;  &nbsp; director p Tubb gave me a job in the afternoon.&nbsp; he said "please attend this meeting at 3 pm&nbsp;on my behalf.&nbsp; i will be busy with another meeting."&nbsp; just before 3 pm, i walked to the stairs as the meeting room is only&nbsp;1 floor above, then i re-read the document and found out that the meeting is actually on monday.&nbsp; whoops there, nearly walked into a room full of strangers who were talking about totally irrelevant topic! &nbsp;  fun fact: &nbsp; oil and water can mix if you just add a little soap water to it.

        my so-called life* (oh jordan, jordan catalano!)    (*inspired by Jenn's entries in her blog)     79-80: 0 year old   i was born on 15th of July, 1979, at 2.36 pm. according to Thai astrology, that makes me under the zodiac sign "libra". the doc had to bring me out by a caesarean cos i didn't turn my head down. i was also the biggest baby the doc had ever pulled out off a woman (the record was broken some 10 years later when another giant kid was born).  &nbsp;  mum and dad gave me a nickname, Oil, cos i was born when Iraq and Iran were having a war and the oil price went skyrocket.&nbsp; being the first born, i guess mum and dad was pretty crazy about me. i have more baby pics than my bro and sis. i also developed quite fast, having teeths and learning to talk, sit, walk etc earlier than average kids. i enjoyed grandmother and grandfather's lullaby a lot.     80-81: 1 year old   i had my hair cut by a brahman sometime in this year i think. it's a ceremony called Goan Poam Fai (Fire Hair Shaving literally) and i had no idea what it was for. neither my bro nor sis entered this ceremony.   my younger sis was born. mum and dad were busy fussing with her (she cried a lot), so i was left alone. my favourite pasttime was trying to catch a stream of water from the tab with my hands.  &nbsp;  i also took my first train ride to visit paternal grandparents in the south.&nbsp; mum and dad said it was like i'd known them for ages.&nbsp;     81-82: 2 years old   younger brother was born. i played with my cousins p Auey and p Yui who live next door in the same compound. it's either this year or last year that i fell off a toy duck face down on the ground, cutting my lip and chipping my front tooth in the process. a dentist fixed it for me. there're a few pictures of me with fat lower lip, hehehe!  &nbsp;    82-83: 3 years old   &nbsp;  i cried each morning when mum tried to go to work, so she bought some strawbery pockey snacks and said to the babysitter in front of me, "give this to the kids after i left."&nbsp; sometimes she bought sparklers too.&nbsp;   i won a raffle and got myself accepted to the Mental Health Centre.&nbsp; it was kind of a pre-kindergarten class.&nbsp; we got to play with sand, colour some pictures, etc.&nbsp; for some reason i remember that it was such a dark place.&nbsp; dad told me that there was a minor earthquake one day and he had to come from work to pick me home this year.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  on the final day of the class all the kids had to dress up in thai costumes and perform some sort of group dance.&nbsp; i peed my pants, probalby&nbsp;twice; once during rehearsal and another during the show.&nbsp; i can't remember exactly but i definitely peed my pants, at least once anyway.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   83-84: 4 years old   i attended 1st year of kindergarten.&nbsp; after a term, i changed school to the one closer to my house.&nbsp; the first day at the new place i got my first daily allowance of 4 baht.&nbsp; that was how much a piece of cake cost.&nbsp; we still coloured pictures and drawed stuff, but we had to memorise thai and english alphabet as well.&nbsp; i remembered "K" well cos there was a picture of King Bhumipol (King Rama 9) right next to it.  &nbsp;   84-85: 5 years old   2nd year of kindergarten.&nbsp; my sis and another next door relative came to attend&nbsp;their&nbsp;1st year at the same place, so we played together during lunch break.&nbsp; i was Bartman and they were my Parman minions, hehehe.  &nbsp;  it was either this year or last year that i had an accident.&nbsp; a friend lifted up a dumbell and hit me above the eye.&nbsp; teachers were all panic and one of them took me to a hospital with a school bus.&nbsp; it seemed very strange to me cos the bus was so big and so empty as there were only the teacher, the driver&nbsp;and i.&nbsp; i had never ride this bus before since my mum dropped me on her way to work.&nbsp; they gave me a couple of stitches near my eyebrow and i got to have next day off.&nbsp; that's probably the first time i got a day off from school.&nbsp; it was strange to live in an empty house and i got so scared when a loud chinese lion group paraded pass my house.  &nbsp;  during summer, mum took me to have the entrance exam for CU demonstration school.&nbsp; the exam was like a kid's iq test or something.&nbsp; they gave us pens to&nbsp;write the&nbsp;answers.&nbsp; i realised&nbsp;i got a lot of the answers wrong but i didn't correct it cos they didn't give us rubbers (probably didn't want us to correct anway).&nbsp; i didn't pass.&nbsp; mum said she was dumbstruck cos she thought i was gonna get it for sure.&nbsp; she asked around for connections to go to decent school.&nbsp; there was one place, royal rose palace school or something, but the headmaster wanted me to repeat a year of kindergarten, saying i was too young. &nbsp;mum ended up using grandfather's connection and got me into a local school instead.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   85-86: 6 years old   because this primary school accepted&nbsp;as a favour for my grandfather, the first day&nbsp;i went to that school was the day the term started.&nbsp; i didn't take any exam at all.&nbsp; when i introduced myself to the class, some kid pointed out that&nbsp;there was a bad word in my name (Onwaree - Wa is a mild swearword).&nbsp; i felt angry and sorry.  &nbsp;  our 1st grade&nbsp;teacher was very kind.&nbsp; come to think of it, maybe she was especially kind to me cos of my grandfather and all.&nbsp; she chose me to carry&nbsp;floral offering&nbsp;on teacher's day and chose me to enter good health competition (i won).&nbsp;&nbsp; she also gave me present on my birthday (4 chicken buns).&nbsp; yeah, i was so mad on that birthday cos we were supposed to have a little party at home but cousins and siblings made fun of the chicken buns the teacher gave me.&nbsp; they put candles on them as if they were cake!&nbsp; i was very angry.

      i am now&nbsp;25 going on 26. &nbsp; yesterday was my birthday.&nbsp; i took a day off and went shopping with Omm.&nbsp; finally bought emjoi hair remover!!!&nbsp; also got other bunch of stuff including 2 lipsticks (buy one get one free), a pocket book, a 100-year astrology calendar, a mirror (my paranoid mirror) and a small case to keep some loose makeup powder at the office, all in good deal! &nbsp; Omm bought some clothes for her study in the states.&nbsp; i tried to pay for a jacket as a present, but she wouldn't accept it.&nbsp; she also bought me a cake (S&amp;P double chocolate cake which was gorgeous).&nbsp; i'm gonna be lonely when she's gone.&nbsp;  &nbsp; today i came to work as usual.&nbsp; the paranoid mirror goes nicely on my desk, although it could be a little wider to cover more space.&nbsp; p Toe from CAT gave me some roses (leftover roses cos he was arranging a vase for a senior officer who's also transfering to someplace else but i appreciated them anyway).&nbsp; moreover, as today is the day for another round of lottery, people in the bureau all bet my numbers (my age, the year i was born, the day i was born, etc).&nbsp; hehe, like i'm sacred or something.&nbsp; holy cow, perhaps.

      just before noon, Ble came with an aghast look on his face.  he wanted to talk to me straight away, but i was on the phone so he waited a bit then scribed something on a piece of paper and shoved it to my face.  it said, "the letter from PTD about your and p Jim+'s transfer just arrived."  Ble, like most people in the office, hadn't known about this secret transfer p Jim, p Goy and i had been undergoing.  he's just learnt from some admin person who received the letter.  i don't think he knows about p Goy's transfer yet cos he didn't say anything.  we had been keeping it a secret especially from Ble cos we all knew that if Ble knew, the whole ministry knew, and we didn't really want people talking about this kind of thing.  but now that the letter has arrived, i guess it's official.  Ble just had a tour around the office (every floor) to spread the news.  i kinda lose heart a bit.  before this, it was like "oh looky i'm leaving soon but nobody knows it wow!"  now it seems more real, with the exact date being set soon.  don't know how the new place, new people and new job will suit me.  i'm gonna miss space affairs bureau!

      hello, it's wednesday!  i forgot to mention that the government (led by that rotten businessman prime minister) declared that all schools were close throughtout this week, as an effort to lighten the traffic cos they're having international aids conference or something.  i personally think aids isn't all that bad.  at least it has the mercy to spread from pregnant mothers to babies.  a baby shouldn't be born if the mother's not going to stay around to look after it, that makes sense in my twisted head.  also i don't think i feel sorry for large propotion of people who got aids anyway.  they get themselves infected, they deserve it.  nazi thoughts, anyone?  i'm taking a day off tomorrow as i don't want to work on my birthday.

      i was very busy working this morning. at 10 am, after finishing the final presentation i felt really sick and it came to me that i hadn't eaten anything.  the feeling was terrible, it wasn't hunger but more like a sickness and i thought i was gonna faint or something.  so i had a couple of apple bananas (is this what it's called? it's smaller from regular banana) i took from home and felt much better almost instantly.  i think director p Tubb is reviewing the final paper right now.  deputy permanent secretary has already left for another meeting (he has like 5 meetings today).  hope director finds the paper alright, so we can present to the deputy by today.  he's leaving for Korea this afternoon.  i'm gonna have a bowl of cereal now.   fun fact:   i've never really fainted once in my life.  there was one time when i was in grade 6, a teacher asked me to do something and i ran off wearing only socks on my feet.  i slipped and fell down on my back and felt suffocated that i couldn't say anything.  teachers gathered around me yelling "a kid passed out!", and they all helped loosen my clothes.  hahaha! i was so embarrassed i didn't tell them i just fell on my own!  the teacher who asked me to run errand for her felt so guilty!

      it's almost 7 pm and i'm still at the office!!  my work doesn't even finish!!  well, it nearly finishes.  there're only attachments left to prepare anyway, which i'm going to do tomorrow.  everybody in the bureau has already left.  director p Tubb is still in, but he walked off to talk to head of personnel group (he's trying to get someone transfered to the bureau to help work as a head of some workgroup).  p Ma'am just left, so i'm all alone.  can't help thinking about the ghost stories they've been talking about now, can i?  but it's quite neat, like i don't have to hurry or worry much now.  i can't get home in time to watch Lek Siu Fong anyway.  the iPSTAR gateway job that's been bothering me since March (!) is nearly over.  i can just blog freely.  hope the traffic is lighter now.

      apart from the iPSTAR gateway work, there's also another minor task assigned by deputy permanent secretary through director.  there's a good chance i'll get home late today.  just hope i get to watch Lek Siu Fung (whateverit'sspelled) on channel 24 at 7 pm.  i'm having a spicy chicken burger from 7-eleven for lunch.  i had fried chicken and tofu for breakfast.  wah, back to work!!!   fun fact:   i figure i should start the fun facts again, only when i feel like it.  fun fact for this post is that chicken is my favourite choice of meat (it used to be prawn/shrimp).

      it's monday again and there're loads of work to finish!  saturday and sunday were spent on reading harry potter and the goblet of fire and sleeping.  i've just started on the 5th book, harry potter and the order of the phoenix, last night.  the book has a lot of details and charactors that i forgot since the first read months (a year?) ago.  i didn't work on the translating job at all.  i'm guilty, but harry potter is so addictive!!  i also didn't go the study thai astrology, cos the teacher called to say that he would be away.    i really have to focus on work today cos director p Tubb just told me specifically to finish everything by today.  i might consider pulling the internet connection off, but lesson from last time i did that is i won't be able to order any printing if the lan connection is off.  MUST.. RESIST.. MYSELF.. FROM READING.. THIS:  urlLink dinosour comics

      the meeting went not as smoothly as p Tubb and i thought.  the PTD officers still wanted to change something in a few documents, so i have to work on that.  moreover, i have to write a memorandum for this meeting.    we had chinese buffet lunch at Miracle Grande Hotel, which was a lot more luxurious than the other place i first thought we were going.  it was an opportunity to make friends with PTD people, very useful since i'm transfering there.  anyway, having a meal with people who aren't exactly friends and someone else is paying is not very fun.  i ate so little!!   fun fact:   i will stop writing fun facts from now on.

      there's a meeting at 10 am today in which deputy director of the Post and Telegraph Department is attending.  director p Tubb is buying him and his team buffet lunch meal afterward, and he told me to come along.  while having a free buffet meal is great, i don't really want to 'hang out' with that lot if it's not work-related.  moreover, i'll definitely have that person i complained about yesterday making snide comments about me getting free fancy meal while others are stuck to the office cafeteria.  ugh.  i told p Tubb politely that he didn't have to include me in the lunch group, and that i would be in the way if the group decide to talk about something junior officer like myself shouldn't know about, but he insisted.  "i tell you to go, you go", that's his words.  that's one thing i notice about p Tubb; he's been making excutive decisions for other people more now that he's a director.  it's like, his words are final and he won't have it any other way.  it should make sense cos he's a big(ger) boss now, but it's a bit strange cos he was such a mild person before.  i don't really mind or anything though.  it's friday again.  dad leaves for China today, and he'll be back on sunday.

      i was supposed to finish these papers and present them to deputy Kraisorn yesterday, but a ShinSat officer called in the afternoon and said there was still another important issue to discuss, so instead i was told (by director) to rewrite some parts of the papers and prepare a meeting on friday.  i am busy today.  someone at the office has been annoying me.  i'm one of the two persons in the bureau who got slightly more salary promotions, then i won the lottery, and she's been bugging me to buy everyone a meal.  what the hell?  just cos i get lucky doesn't mean i have to share, bitch!  i can tell she really means it too.  i have to focus on work today.  i'm pulling the lan connection off the computer now.

      pursuing this perfect life shall be my mission.  or maybe not.  i just want it, that's all.  1.  find someone and get married sometime in the next 4 or 5 years 2.  give birth at 30, just as mum retires from work so she can stay home and watch the kid for me 3.  focus on career and become head of something  not very likely.

      p Winai (former boss/supervisor) bought us lunch.  p Tim+, p Maew, p Aiw, p Winai, p Goy, p Jim+, p Sang, p Aey, p Ging and i went to Nittaya restaurant.  the food was great and we really had a good time, then we went back to the office.  i've just arrived just now (hehe bad employee).  good thing director p Tubb is having a meeting again.  before lunch i had a private meeting with p Tubb and Shin Satellite officers.  p Tubb told the ShinSat guys to work on a paper and send it to the ministry today, but in order to present this work to deputy permanent secretary, i have to finish the paper on my part (which is a lot more complicated that ShinSat's part) too.  deputy Kraisorn is out of town ever so often.  this week, for example, he is in only today and tomorrow.  so i guess i have to finish my work today (impossible) or tomorrow.   fun fact:   not sure if this is a fact or not, but i've read somewhere that only humans and dolphins have sex for recreational purposes.

      although yesterday was boring, there are quite a few things worth mentioning.    p Ton, fed up with the way he had been treated around here, decided to quit the job for the 3rd time (the first 2 times he sent the resignation form to his boss who's also his aunt but she just ignored it then tore it up).  this time, p Ton is decisive than ever.  he sent his resignation letter to the administration bureau directly and an officer has signed to officially accept this letter already so no one can just ignore or destroy it this time.  it's a shame really, p Ton is one of the most talented, hard-working officers we have here.  he usually has to write speeches for the minister and the permanent secretary because of his outstanding english skill.  it should be fun to see the quality of speeches go down the hill after he leaves.  after all, it's the permanent secretary and the ministry who have to read those speeches!  aside from him, Nuch from international affairs bureau and p Tik from legal section have already resigned and the resignations have already been effective.  more people are thinking or surreptitiously planning/working on leaving.  when will they (the executives) realise that we are losing quality people?  when will they learn to take care of us better, or improve the way they work and manage things around here?  sometimes i just hope the ministry goes down in flame.  good people simply cannot find the motivationo to work here.  we used to have a public relation officer with a master degree (she entered the ministry the same time as i did).  she was the only pr officer the ministry had then.  oh, the stupid things they made her do.  one of her main jobs was to cut every ministry-relating news from various newspapers then glue them to A4 papers, then make copies and distribute around the office, and that took half of her day everyday.  when she presented a pr project to the superiors, they just rejected it, saying "why hire a consultant? we have our own pr officer, we can do it ourselves."  so she ignored 7,790 baht government salary and left to work on her own private business and got married.  now she has a beautiful, meaningful life.  the funny part is after she left, they got more pr officers (2 or 3) and they still have to hire a consultant to work on the ministry pr plan.  how dumb is that?!?    p Ton, another example, rarely gets to go home when the office hour finishes (that's 4.30 pm).  it's not unnatural for him to left the office at 9 or 10 pm.  he is talented, he is dedicated and he works hard, but he has been overlooked when the promotion times came.  moreover, he got scolded by the permanent secretary time after time and even during meetings.  all of those for lousy 7-8 thousands a month.  a person like him can easily find work in the private sector and get 5 times more salary, so working for the government has been sort of charity work for him i imagine (he comes from a wealthy family), but why work if no one appreciates, right?

      i just went to take a crap in the office toilet.  i didn't noticed that there weren't any toilet paper left until after i actually shat.  it was very frustrating, but at least there was water to clean myself.    my neck feels stiff today, probably because of how i slept last night.

      on saturday i got up very late, managed to get downstairs at 11.30 am.  mum made noodles for lunch then we (mum and i) went to study Thai astrology at Petchkasem 79.  we studied more star patterns today, and the teacher told me something he should have said a few months ago:  "your government star (the sun) is in a good position.  you're better off working for the government."  shit.  shit indeed.  the Post and Telegraph Department is sending an inquiry letter regarding my transfer any day now, and i can't just say "no thanks, i've been thinking and i don't want to go anymore." now can i, after all i said to the interviewers ("i am decisive.  i've thought it throught and i really want to transfer.")?    oh, what the hell.  i wonder if i'm becoming overly superstitious.  on sunday dad, mum, Khun Pa and i went to our country house (oohh how posh!) in Petchburi.  it's next to Petchburi river and the water was especially high that day.  someone said they were releasing water from Kangkrajaan dam.  the place is very peaceful but i wouldn't say it's suitable to stay overnights.  we still have to use water straight from the river, the toilets don't flush properly, no air conditioner and nothing to do there.  Khun Pa and dad have to go there regularly (once or twice a month) to pay the workers and take some products.  we plant trees that give fruits around here.  this time we get bananas, limes and pomeloes.  it's monday again.  my birthday is next week.  i have to find the time to give some necessities and donate money to a temple somewhere.  maybe i'll let mum choose the temple for me.  in Thai astrology, it will be the beginning of my 26th year.  i'm old and i have nothing to brag about!   fun fact:  i haven't cleaned my room properly for over a year now. maybe 2 years. heh.

      i got called to a meeting in the morning.  actually, they called for director but he wasn't in so i took his place.  there was nothing constructive as usual.  the permanent secretary spent more time talking about non-related crap than the actual topic meeting.  i fell asleep again.  at 1 pm i have to leave for another meeting.  hope it finishes before 4 pm cos i won't take my car there and i'll have to come back to the office.  p Jim+ and i cashed our lottery during lunch break (just now).  got deducted 120 baht (bookie cashing fee), which is not too bad.  all in all, i profited 1775 baht.  i'm gonna have to prepare for the afternoon meeting now.

      whoo, yesterday was exciting.  p Maew also won last 2 digits prize lottery.  noticing the persons who won this time (myself, p Jim+ and p Maew) are the usual passengers of my Izusu (we go home together), could one say my car is lucky?  hehehe.  i forgot to mention this yesterday.  at lunch p Uu told us about ghosts in the office.  they said (no one knows who are this 'they' exactly) a construction worker fell down one of the lift (i use 'lift' to be british) shaft and killed himself while the building was being built.  nowadays, if you stay behind late at night and use that lift, it might stop at floors you don't select.  also, crying has been heard after dark in the girls toilet on ICT2 floor.  no one knows where this one came from.  i guess every place needs its own ghost stories.  the ones about our office building aren't very impressive in my opinion, but colleagues have discussed about installing some sort of programmes in the office computers that would make them say something like "there is a dead man...." late at night, specifically when the directors stay behind to work (director of international affairs bureau always does that).  i think the idea is splendid!  how ironic, ghost computers for ministry of ICT!   fun fact:   up until now i think i have witnessed just 1 ghost-related phenomenon.  it was more than 10 years ago and i went shopping at Pata with my family.  we were walking to the lift and i saw the door was closing so i shouted out "wait!" cos i saw that there was somebody in the lift; a woman of regular size with long hair dressed in white, light clothes.  the door closed anyway but i pushed the button and the door opened again almost instantly, turned out there was no one there!  i was amazed more than scared.

      i won the lottery, last 3 digits!!  actually i have to say we (p Jim+ and i) won, cos we shared this ticket.  the number is 169664 and we won the 664 bit.  4000 baht prize will be divided and we get 2000 each.  amazing, huh?  we bought this ticket a few days earlier.  i had a hunch i'd get the prize, but not with this ticket.  i thought the numbers i bought underground would hit it.  oh well, 165 baht well spent anyway.  a great beginning for the second half of the year!

      stupid, childish habit.  why do i always spill nasty stuff on my shirts?  today i wear a white shirt, one of the two that are wearable since the 3rd one was damaged in an incident involving the iron (my careless maid burnt my perfectly good shirt and jacket).  then we had lunch near the office cos Nuch (a temp from International Affairs Bureau) is leaving.  that's something we got to celebrate cos things can only get better for her now.  anyway, i spilled some spicy sauce on my shirt.  now i look stupid.  as a kid, i always stained my school shirt with ice cream.  apparently, after more than 10 years i am still my own careless self.  get ready for some Stay-Clean (tm) action tonight!  ps: i got part of the salary that the ministry owed me today.  4,568 baht!  i first thought it was gonna be only 3,xxx baht, so this is good news!   fun fact:   hmm this is tough cos i can't think of one now.  ok, here it is: prior to my obsession with rock music (Guns n' Roses in particular), i really liked Tommy Page.

      you know i was telling that i bought some lotteries yesterday?  well, i didn't exactly 'buy' them.  i asked someone at the office to buy them for me, i just gave her the numbers and money.  this morning she said they were all sold out (meaning the lottery agents in her area had sold all the lottery coupons already... lottery is popular this time cos the government lied and said they'd increased the prize money).  what if my numbers win?  why does this have to happen to me?!?  (edit)  after i posted 'what if' entry, a fellow government employee told me that i still could buy those numbers underground (illegal lottery: win less money with risk of bookie not paying when you win), so i bought the same numbers plus 44.  i'm betting illegally!!

      yesterday i bought some lottery numbers: 484, 448, 844, 75.  the first 3 were from that dream i had about gun, dead people, castle and black horses (turned out when i looked for the meaning in the internet it said they all brought good luck).  the last number 75 was from the fact that a lizard tell on my hand a couple days ago (a lizard also feel on my back on saturday).  neat, huh?  i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing, buying lottery and stuff like this cos luck and i aren't friends, but this time i felt (feel) guided somehow.  i don't have exiting dreams with ok plots and still remember them after i wake up very often, and lizards don't fall on my bodyparts often either.  today we'll see if i win or not.  by the way, did you notice a song name in the first paragraph?  i slept a lot last night.  got up at 3 am, then again at 4 am.  i had a dream about numbers.  i was supposed to read out or dial someone's fax number, but i couldn't cos the number on the business card kept changing.  then there was a number 44.  i don't know where it came from, and i haven't bought this lottery number either.  what if this number wins? *bites hand*   fun fact:   according to my limited thai astronomy knowledge and my birth star chart, i'm gonna live beyond 75 years old.

      about 10 years ago, when we were young and reckless, there was this guy whom we called Kirk.  now we don't even remember who he really was, his real name, or how he looked like.  we do remember there was a Kirk in our lives though.  today i let Window Media Player play the songs randomly, and i like it very much.  normally i'd have to skip when it gets to the songs i don't like, but today it play randomly perfect.

      it's monday after 4-day holiday. i intended to post something from home during the holiday but the internet package had been used up. i already typed something about Thursday and Friday but it's at home.   Saturday  it was between sleeping and reading throughout Saturday. i should have done other (more) useful things instead but couldn't bring myself off the sofa. the weather was nice too, not too hot or cold.  at night p Yui came to watch tv with me. i was grateful for her company. p Neung (p Auey's boyfriend) was at their house so maybe p Yui didn't want to hang around there. anyway, p Yui convinced me to watch Academy Fantasia (a reality show about singing contest on UBC). now i'm hooked!!   Sunday  on Sunday i was a bit more active. Omm called and we talked for over an hour. she sounded okay though a bit irritated by dad's nonchalant takes on things. i bought lunch from next door, watched some tv, took a nap. the weather was even better cos it rained a bit.  i was woke up by the squeaking noise cos Hell Boy, a 9 year old who lives with his no good mother at the back of the house, was playing dog's toy. i was so mad so i got out and yelled at him to go away. i wish i've said nastier things though. i hate kids, especially ones that shouldn't have been born in the first place. people should be more responsible goddamnit!

      i would like to take this opportunity to say what a fecalphiliac Waroontip is.  Waroontip (aka Valentini, Keaw, Eiw) talks about excrement everyday.   "it's time to take a crap."   "i've just done shitting.  it felt great."   "my shit is in appropriate shape and size today."   "today i shat one foot long of shit."  and so on.  i suspect she's been fond of excrement for ages, but just came out a few years ago.  i should have noticed it in November 1999 when she came to Kite university for Loy Kratong festival and talked to me about a website about shitting angels non-stop.  oh my god.  Jenn talks about her shit too, but it feels normal.  at least she doesn't talk about it everyday.   you sick bastard.

      yesterday while i was chatting on MSN with Lotus school friends, one said another friend was gonna kill herself.  we have been aware of the kind of guy she was dating.  he is no good.  he is a worthless piece of human, but my friend adores him so.  this time he somehow led her to believe that he was going to study with her in England and it was really something she looked forward to, then she found out he wasn't going afterall.  we were worried about her and two of us rushed to see her soon after, then i called her and she told me that she was going out.  i talked with another friend and she said the dumb girl was probably going to see her psychotic so-called boyfriend.  i don't understand it at all.  my friend cared too much about men.  she seems to think romance is the most important aspect of her life, but always falls for the wrong kind of men.  i don't get it.  she sometimes appears very devoting and giving, but she flirts with other men at the same time.  actually i don't really think it's wrong to consider a few men at the same time, but why don't she think that men are browsing too?  most of her guys already had girlfriends when she started to get together with them, so how could she not be expecting that the men were ready to leave her when they see a better girl?  it's the extreme between a slut and a martyr, that friend. seems like a player, to stupid to actually play.  stupid people shouldn't play dangerous games.  everything she has done is against my personal belief and practice.

      i just took a very long nap at work.  i came back from lunch at 1.20 pm, chatted on MSN a bit, then took some notes and documents from a file to summarize.  next thing i knew, a friend was standing at my desk (must had been standing there for a while).  when he saw that i was already awake, we talked a little.  then i went back to sleep.  this time when i woke up it was already 3 pm!!  how embarrassing!!

      well hello.  i was quite busy on Monday and didn't have the chance to tell what happened during the weekend and yesterday.  ---------  Saturday  Omm called at 10.30 am (it was 10.30 pm Friday night in Texas).  she sounded okay, said she had a very tight schedule, already reserved a place (kinda an efficiency room) and was moving in next Saturday.  she asked if i wanted anything cos she was going shopping on Sat and Sun but i couldn't think of any!  i thought about asking her to buy a  Trust Company  CD but i figured i should try here in Bangkok first.   at noon i called my astrology teacher's house but he wasn't home.  i called at the temple where he taught in the morning and they said he already left, so i called his house again.  his daughter said he probably went to teach somewhere else.  what the hell?!?  i already paid for lifetime of private lessons!  but i was lazy anyway.  so i stayed home with mum (who cared where E Erb was), threw away some magazines and things (i plan to throw things away from my house bit by bit), took the dogs out for a walk, then went to Macro.  mum made sukiyaki for dinner.  we watched  Final Destination 2  on HBO.  i wanted to watch  The Cable Guy  at 11 pm cos i wanted to see  Ben Stiller  and  Owen Wilson  in their earlier work but fell asleep first.   Sunday  i had a mild upset stomach today.  went to the toilet probably 3-4 times and shat in liquid.  i suspected it because of Jele i bought from Macro the day before.  i also had this nagging headache all day and used it as an excuse not to go hang out with Ra, Pinn and Waroon.  i stayed home and mended some clothes.  there was a shirt that supposed to be a long-sleeve shirt but the sleeves were too short so i changed it into a half-sleeve shirt (previously i had to fold the sleeves up to my elbows when i wore the shirt).  i'm so proud of myself!  Khun Pa came in the evening and talked to mum about the aroma therapy oil-making programme she attended with p Yui.  she was once again full of ideas (replace ideas with shit here).   "it's really easy!  we can turn it into business!  we can choose the fragrance and the kind of oils we like, blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda!"   you know, those kinds of crap.  a few weeks ago she talked like this but about turning her Pad Thai making skill into business, and a few months before she talked about running her own charity thrift shop.  it's quite funny actually.   Monday  i was busy almost all day.  i don't really want to go into details here, let's just say i had a few tasks that were urgent on my hand, plus a meeting at 5 pm.  after the meeting i stayed and talked to director p Tubb for a while about my transfer to the Post and Telegraph Department.  he was very supportive [paranoid mode: too supportive? he probably wanted me out all along!].  i told him i preferred to start working there on Monday the 4th of October.   p Don (Ton) invited some people to his retirement party this saturday (he really is leaving the ministry).  i want to be there, but i don't want to go.  i probably ended up not going, hahaha!!  i mean, if his house is within walking distance from my house i'd definitely go, but his house is in Patumthani, even beyond Dreamworld Theme Park!  it rained and when i got back at home i found Dada soaking wet.  poor thing couldn't get himself to a dry place!  i was drying him off with a towel and Tom came straight to hurt Dada cos he was jealous.  i yelled him off and he looked very confused and frustrated, barking at trees and cars and other dogs before running to mum.  what a dumb dog! ---------  and today is Tuesday.  all the tasks are still here for me to finish.  *sighs*

      i was looking forward to 1.30 pm on Friday cos Taan' was coming to chair the SMMS meeting near the bureau. little did i know i was getting lucky!! someone from another bureau came and asked me who was going to attend the meeting with Taan'. as p Jim was busy on the phone, i asked her what the matter was and she said she needed Taan' to sign some document for her. oh my god.  i did some quick thinking and said "p Jim+ is busy but you can leave it to me. Taan' is having a meeting at this room right here. he's gonna past my desk and i can give the document to him then." AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! that way, i appeared naturally nice, and i got a chance to talk to Taan' in person. i waited and waited, but Taan' was late. he didn't come until 3.00 pm, but it was worth the wait.   "Taan' sir, the Sor Sor Bureau left this document for you to sign."   "oh yeah. it's the [insert name of a department here]    document, isn't it"  (mumbling while flipping through the document)  "i wouldn't know, sir. she just asked me to show it to you."   "yeah yeah it's [insert name of a department here]    document. it sure is urgent."  (staring at a contusion on his left thumb)  "you have a wound on your hand, sir."   "yeah yeah, i got caught in the thing the other day, big time."   "uh hum."   "please give this back to Sor Sor bureau immediately. it's urgent."   "yes, sir."   i couldn't believe it! i said something about his thumb!! i noticed it for several seconds and i was thinking if i should mention it, then i said it! i tried to have a conversation!! Taan' wasn't being clear about what happened to his thumb, though. how is one supposed to know what thing got his thumb big time?  a colleague MSNed me right after Taan' went to the meeting room, saying "what are you so gleeful about?" oh my god, did he notice?!? i wonder what my face was like when i was talking to Taan'!! i hope it wasn't too lustful!!

      i'm feeling like a crazy schoolgirl.  yesterday i went to the ICT Expo at noon.  after lunch i met up with Waroon and Pinn then we had a walk around the Expo, played some games and received some souvenirs (pens, etc).  i said to them that i wished Taan' was there, then we seperated.  i hung out with the bureau's officers to wait for the gala dinner to start.  then i saw Taan'!!!  his hair was such a mess like he didn't have time to have it properly cut, and i saw him for only a few seconds.  i tried to look for him all night but i didn't know where he sat or whether he actually stayed for the dinner.  i felt like i was a schoolgirl secretly stalking my crush.   but today he'll chair a meeting in the meeting room near my office!  i can catch glimpse of him then!  i'm so in love!

      as part of the ICT Expo, Sony has brought its super intelligent robot called QRIO to show.  we at the bureau were asked if we wanted to see it first on Tuesday before the Expo.  at first i mistook Q in its name for O, so i thought the robot was called Oreo and thought that it was an Oreo-making robot!  i didn't see QRIO on Tuesday (i am not very interested in robots unless they are food-making robots) but the name Oreo got stuck in my mind for a few days.  this morning i bought some Oreo cookies and i just remember why i bought it!  it was because of that damn robot!  makes me 8 cookies fatter!!!  i'm going to the Expo in the afternoon.  probably stay for the gala dinner in the evening too.

      yesterday that thing was finally over.  yay!   it rains often lately, usually in the evening.  quite annoying really cos the polished stone bench i normally sit on to play with the dogs gets wet and the floor gets wet and i can't play with the dogs.  last night i slept in mum's room to save up energy.  mum snored all night!  don't know how dad put up with it every night.  maybe i won't sleep there again tonight.

      got up at 4 am to see dad and Omm off to the US at the airport. there were no tears but i really did feel sad. hope i get a chance to visit Omm there. maybe i should start giving Omm list of CDs i want so she can buy and have dad take them home to me, hehehehe! i should have thought of making the list earlier but i completely forgot.  i arrived the office before 6.30 but the building wasn't open yet so i walked to the cafeteria and newstand. Dane sent me a message yesterday that Velvet Revolver was on the cover of Music Express, July issue. i couldn't find it at the newstand. how cruel!!  it's the first day of Bangkok International ICT Expo 2004 today. this is a really big event. i don't know what my plans are for today as of now cos i have to see that the thing that's supposed to be done since last week is finally completed before i can do anything else. i'd love to just hang out and have a stroll at the expo, but then there are numerous things to take care of. *sighs* i might even have to go to Kite university at 6 pm to have an English test (i'm applying for an Effective Communication course there, study on Saturday mornings).

      i couldn't do the thing that was supposed to be done on Friday. the information was not confirmed so director told me to go home at 5.30 pm. it was a minor relief.   Saturday  i went with dad to his small paper tube plant in Bangping. dad had brought a few geese and a couple of goats (new addition) to the plant and kept them there, mainly because he wanted them to keep the grass and unwanted plants to the minimum. it was the first time i saw those goats. they were cute!! they wouldn't let me touch them but i got to feed them leaves. the male goat was very possessive of all things fed to both of them, and he tried to hit the female when she ate her leaves, eventhough there were a bunch of leaves in front of his face. after the female ran away for a while, the male would cry for her companionship. what a jerk.   Sunday  dad taught me to check a few things in cars like coolant and some kinds of oil cos i'll have to do all these while he goes to the USA for 3 weeks. mum made great dinner in the evening; sticky rice, Somtam, Laab, grilled pork and fried chicken!  i finished the chinese book Red Snow Swordsmaster in the evening. it was like "huh?" i guess it's supposed to be philosophical towards the end, but huh? i just failed to see the reasons for what had happened in all earlier 300 pages. but it was entertaining. i'm planning on buying Ninth Month Falcon by the same auther soon.   Monday  ordered pizza for lunch. yummy. then we went to Macro to buy some grocery. we took mum's car and it was such a mess. we bought a lot of things from Macro including mum's office supplies like plastic drawers and file holders and stuff. seriously, why did she have to buy these things herself? doesn't her office have purchashing officers to take care of it? anyway, the car was packed on the way home that Omm decided not to stop by at Foodland afterwards. Omm and i were thoroughly annoyed.  seriously, mum's the person most responsible for the state of our house. there are just too many objects, it's like living at a garbage dumping site sometimes. i think mum has this self-concocted superior notion that she's intellectual cos she has a lot of books, but truth is she never reads 85% of them. besides, she gets all possessive everytime someone mentions these books should be donated. now i know i can just throw them away a few at a time cos this way she'll never notice.   Tuesday - today  it's already the day before the expo, and i still can't do the thing that's supposed to be done since last week. but i just had 3-day rest, and i feel much more positive and calm than last week. there's no need to rush anymore cos it wasn't on time in the first place.  all state enterprises have a day off today, but we lowly government officers have to come to work. the ministry's office is in a state enterprise building. the good side is we have plenty of parking space to choose today, but the bad is they don't sell food in the cafeteria. even 7-Eleven is closed. we have to order lunch from outside.

       1991-1992: 12 years old  Lotus school seemd like a very threatening place at first. before the term started, mum and dad repeatedly reminded me that most kids i was gonna be studying with were the best of the best schools, and i who wasn't even the best of a local government school would have to study really hard to keep up with them. however, there was a math test to seperate students in 3 groups depending on how well they could answer. i heard my name calling to group 1 (smart kids) but it didn't register in my head at first. i had to ask a friend if she heard the same thing. the weight was suddenly lifted from my chest: i was competitive!  7th grade was the year i enjoyed most. there were a lot of funny things. i was a happy dork with thick glasses and bad haircut. firstly i sat next to a boy and the teacher warned him to behave in front of the whole class, i was so scared like i was sitting next to a thug or something. turned out he was just funny. i had a crush with a tall dark funny kid. i became close to 4 girls and our group would hang out in the tiny space called 'hell' during lunch break. it's hard to explain what exactly happened but all in all 7th grade was good fun, like the time the iceman brought some ice to the soda stand on motorcycle and the kids yelled "Ple, it's your dad, Mr Suchin!" or the time we put prickly heat powder on Vitch's swimming trunks, or the time i photocopied a picture of snake to scare Narumol and made her sing.  during summer before 8th grade our group minus one attended the science camp. we got to know older kids and i had a crush on a short boy with big head. turned out he was the son of the biggest booze-making factory in the country, hahaha! he played basketball really well despite of his height (or should i say shortness?).    1992-1993: 13 years old  our group got seperated in the 8th grade, but we had lunch together. i was exposed to the greatest rock band called Guns n' Roses, became a music maniac soon after.  8th grade was also fun, but it lacks certain innocent feelings. we talked about our crushes in our group. that kid i thought was a thug was in my room in 8th grade and i had a crush on him. we were friends at the same time. i wore my hair long for the first time and haven't worn it short since.  one morning this thug-like dude (we call him Jerk) who sat next to me rubbed my arm repeatedly, saying he was cold. it was in the middle of a class! i told him to stop but he didn't so i got mad and didn't talk to him. when he realised that i was angry, he tried to reconcile. he actually made me laugh but i hid it just to play cool and after a while he stopped, started to feel angry himself. when lunch break came, he didn't let me out (my seat was against the wall and his seat was right next to mine so i had to pass him to go in and out) but said we should reconcile first. i refused and tried to get pass him, so he caught my arm. i hit him in the face when he didn't let go.  i walked out of the classroom to meet my friends. he followed and hit me in the face too! i was a girl! we had seperate classes all afternoon so i only met him again after schools when he shouted "i'm sorry!" then ran away. we made up next morning. he said after he hit me, he thought he would never be friends with me again. i was really glad it didn't happen that way.  during the short period we didn't speak to each other, 3 people came to me and said i should make up with him cos he was being miserable or something (probably 'or something'). why would they know? why would they care anyway? it was just 2 kids fighting! but all in all, getting hit in the face by a dude certainly has a place in my memory, hehehe!  summer before 9th grade we attended the science camp again, this time all 5 of us. it was by the sea and at night i would pretend that Slash and his yatch were waiting for me behind the mountain on a nearby island, hahaha!! on our way back to Bangkok we had some rice snack and it made us high (as high as i ever be anyway).    1993-1994: 14 years old  i planned to listen to Gn'R song "14 years" first thing after i woke up on my birthday, but when the time came i wasn't in the mood and listened to something else.  9th grade was okay. Jerk and i were in the same classroom again, but we weren't very close anymore. our homeroom teacher was a friend of my mum's when they studied at this Lotus school, and our room was full of alumni's kids. she taught social science which i loathed and failed. meanwhile, i got really good marks in English. when announcing the students' test results, she said "onwaree did very good in english but fail my subject. perhaps she likes the english teacher (Mrs. Salt-cured Plum was her nichname) more than me." i didn't feel anything special towards the english teacher, but that certainly made me hate our homeroom/social science teacher more.  in winter (i didn't remember which month.. Nov or Dec or Jan?) the 9th grade kids had to go to a training camp in Chiangmai as a part of redcross girlscout/boyscout programme. the camp was actually a military training camp for border soldiers. the school rented a train for this occasion and the kids went wild, some drank and smoked just after we left the station before getting all the booze and fags confiscated by the trainer soldiers upon the arrival. it was very cold up north but i had fun anyway. i've always been scared of height a little, but i attended all the height-involving activities including jumping from a 4-storey tower. i was so proud of myself! there was a girl who actually passed out in mid-air, hahaha!! i was a flagbearer of the team cos i was the tallest, and a trainer soldier used the flag to hit me on the head for not keeping the flag clean. bastard. at night i also had to lead the team on a walk in the dark (in which trainer soldiers were hiding dressed in ghouls to scare us). we all knew there were gonna be fake ghouls and ghost, yet the girls managed to act like they were really scared, probably wanting to gain boys' attention more than anything. i was so annoyed.  apparently our 9th grade class caused to much trouble for those poor border soldiers cos younger students didn't get to go to Chiangmai ever again.  apart from social science which had always been my weakness, science became another subject that i didn't quite understand, and i only got 2 (C). i decided to go for the math/english oriented programme for high school.  i took a shot at a nearby famous high school's entrance exam, didn't really expect to study there. the results were announced during i was visiting grandparents down south with my family and my friend called to tell me i passed. about half the students who graduated 9th grade from Lotus school entered that school, including one from my group of friends.    1994-1995: 15 years old   news flash: i sucked at math too!  there were only 30 students in the math/english oriental programme, 27 of them were girls. the girls were mostly snobs so i hanged out with new kids during class, and got together with my group (2 in math/bio science, 1 in french/english) when we didn't have classes. we also chose Japanese as our selective subject.  hight school math was so damn hard. i didn't notice how bad i was cos most students failed the test at first, then there were only a few students and i who needed resit exam. i didn't really care about it but mum was devastated. meanwhile, i got the highest marks in English of the entire 10th grade class one term (cos the better students already left for the nearby school). i was so proud.  before my 15th birthday i passed the first part of AFS scholarship test to be an exchange student in Sweden. i was supposed to be 15 by end of June 1995, so i was 15 days too young. i talked to an English teacher and she said she'd help talk to somebody so that i could go on to another part of the exam (interview), but when i asked about it later she just said i wasn't qualified and that was it. what the fuck!?! anyway, it's not like AFS is a real scholarship. i'd still have to pay huge load of money if i won the scholarship (but not as much as the total cost).  apart from school, i also started guitar lessons this year. first mum didn't want me to learn playing the guitar cos she wanted me to play Thai instrument instead, so she said she wouldn't pay for my lessons. i just ignored her and asked the money from dad. i studied for an hour on Saturdays.    1995-1996: 16 years old   this year was as boring as the last. still sucked at math, got good grades in English and got the highest mark of the entire class for another term. i really don't know what to write about for this year, except for most students (myself included) passed the high school equivalent exam so we were able to take central university entrance exam a year early.  we got to choose up to 4 bachelor programmes from what the public universities had to offer, took the entrance exam, and they would rank our marks and match them with ranks of programmes we chose. my choices were BBA (international programme), economics, social science (public fiscal) and law, all from Kite university. i just knew i was weak at math so i tried to avoid programmes that obviously needed math, so i was thinking maybe i'd get into faculty of pol science or law. i just chose BBA cos the international programme offered exchange opportunity, and economics cos i didn't know what else to choose. other faculties like arts or education were just lame.  turned out that my marks match the bachelor of economics programme's rank. i almost fell down when i heard the news. i somehow knew i'd pass the entrance exam, but didn't expect it to be faculty of economics at all. anyway, since i passed the exam, i had to play guitar for our spiritual landlord as a sacrifice 15 minutes for 7 days. i skipped 12th grade just like that.

      i remember already typing this up once.  maybe i didn't get around to post it due to bad internet connection or something.  i bought Emjoi Gently Gold, a hair-removing equipment, as a present for myself on my 25th birthday.  the salesperson said gold on the tweazer heads makes it grip hair more effectively, but i bought this model because of friends' recommendations more than anything else.  i tried it on the next day, and it was such a painful, twisted experience!  it was twisted cos it was with great pain, and i was the one who inflicted such pain onto myself, bit by bit.  usually with waxing strips, it takes just one big decisive pull and a big patch of hair is gone.  besides, the pain of having large amount of hair pulled off at once just makes it numb.  but with Emjoi, everytime the tweazer heads caught a hair, i couldn't help jerk my hand (and the equipment) away from my legs.  it sure takes a lot of guts to use this thing!  i couldn't finish both my legs with the first time, so i used a tweazer on the remaining thick, dark hairs, and just ignored the rest of the hair all together.  then a week later i used Emjoi for the second time.  it still felt as painful as the first time but i was more able to control myself and got rid of more hair this time.  i tried it with underarm hair too, and it didn't felt close to painful at all.  i've been using tweazer on underarm hair for ages so that's probably why it didn't feel painful.  i'm so grateful for this equipment; although i'd still have to use tweazer on some leftover, ingrown hair, but that's far better than having to twist my neck to pull out all underarm hair one by one.  i was able to cover all my legs by the third time i used Emjoi, maybe because i was getting used to it or something.  when putting pain aside, it's really an effective equipment!
