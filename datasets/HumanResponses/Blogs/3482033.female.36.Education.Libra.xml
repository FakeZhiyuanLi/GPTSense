      Not one to shy away from the controversial, I can't think of a more important topic to address in my first "real" blog post.    I am a feminist. I repeat.. I am a feminist!   Culturally "Feminism" has become almost a dirty word.  Young women who see the world completely open to them shake their head decidedly when asked if they are, in fact, feminists.  Intelligent, aware men and women roll their eyes to mock and disavow feminism as an important part of our socio-history.  And women who embrace feminism as part of themselves are likened to the narcisitic, dictatorial, twisted, brutal embodiment of evil when they are referred to as "Femi-nazis".    I am, however, a feminist.   I am the youngest of 8 children.  I have 5 older sisters. The oldest, Clair, is an Industrial Psychologist in St. Louis. Janine is a special ed teacher in the Las Vegas school district who, while teaching full time, aquired her Master's in Educational Technology.  Anne works in city management in a small California town. Elizabeth is an independent consultant who works in the area of public housing and government regulations. She lives in Washington D.C.  Susan serves as both the Executive Director and Lobbyist for the Illinois Chapter of the National Organization for Women and has recently been elected to the 16 seat National NOW Board of Directors. They are all amazing women. All of them contribute to the world in ways large and small.  All are caring, nurturing, and inquisitive, and all give 100% of themselves in their public professions and their private homes.    We all embrace fully that we are feminists.   I am truly amazed, and saddened, when I hear of the distortion of the concept of feminism in pop culture and politics.  Equity, in every broad and narrow interpretation of that word, benefits not only those who have suffered marginalization or a lower status socially by virtue of some characteristic (race, class, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability or disability, religion, etc.) but also those who have been afforded greater status because of such characteristics.  More specifically, the world becomes a better place when all men and women share a heightened sense of value in who they are, when all are equally allowed to contribute to the world, when all are afforded the same opportunties (even if the choices they make are somehow different), when all are able to express to its fullest what makes them the best that they can be.    The distortion comes when those who have been afforded the higher status feel entitled to that position, and work to maintain that position to the detriment of others.  But there is no such entitlement.  It doesn't exist. It is socially constructed. We made the rules. And thus the rules can be changed.   This is one of the reasons why I am a feminist.   Less than 35 years ago, a man could not be charges with rape if the woman he assaulted was his wife. Not more than a generation ago women could not vote, own property, get a divorce, be protected from losing employment because of pregnancy, enjoy the same salaries as others doing the same job, or be accepted into prestigious colleges.  Through the hard labor and incredible personal risk of many brave women, early and contemporary feminists, these situations, and others similar, have changed. The lives of our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, are all the better for these efforts. And .. so are the lives of our fathers, brothers, husbands and sons.  We have all benefited from the contributions of women who fought hard to enjoy what was already theirs -- equity!   It makes me proud to be a feminist!  There is a terrific article in the May issue of "O" magazine which highlights the lives of the up and coming generation of girls.  These girls are confident, secure in their bodies, ambitious for the future, hard working, full of potential, and optimistic that whatever they set out to achieve they will.  Perhaps it is a bit naive to think they won't encounter any barriers by virtue of their gender, but at the same time it's is incredibly gratifying for me to see a generation of girls who will see these barriers as the exceptions, not the rules.  I want the same for my daughter.  I want the same for myself. I want the same for all young men and women who set the bar high for themselves.  And, I think humbly, we will all have better lives because of them!   I am a feminist.

      I have no idea how to do this blogging thing, though I've become convinced that I mentally blog all day long! Perhaps some of that will find its way here. Then again, with my skill and luck, it may end up in the dark recesses of the cyber-Black Hole!!!

      I need to say it.... NEGATIVISM DRIVES ME BATTY!   *whew* .. Much better.   For some reason, it seems today that most men and women around me are so incredibly negative.  Complaining about big things. Complaining about little things. Complaining about things over which they have no control Complaining about things totally within their control.   I have been accused of being "Mary Friggin' Poppins" on occasion so I understand that my disposition lends itself to being more positive. At the same time I know that the energy one creates, and the energy one puts out in the world, has everything to do with the energy one receives in return.  I want to ask folk when they bitch, and bitch, and bitch about everything and everyone around them.. "If its ALL so bad.. what does it say about YOU that you are in the midst of it all?!?!?!"   The thoughts going through my head have been these.. and trust me, this is stream-of-consciousness typing here..   Take ownership in that which troubles you  Fix it  Problem solve  If someone has torked you off, then go talk to them about it!   Bitching about it after the fact leaves the burden completely on YOU and leaves those who have created the problems completely unburdened!   Talking behind their back says more about you then about them!  Get some perspective!    Ok, that's enough for now! I myself am not enjoying complaining about the complaining! Truly, I know as well as I know my own name, that keeping one's focus on that which is positive, expecting one's self to be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem, lighting a candle rather than cursing the darkness, is part of the road to true happiness!!!
