      This is likely to be my final post for a while. Tonight, I will go to bed early (probably not though) and wake up at 3:00am. I'll then drive to Erie to catch my plane to Pittsburgh, and from there it's a direct flight to Florida.  Now, Erie's not the biggest of airports. But wouldn't it be fun to be chased through the airport/chase someone through an airport, like Ross chasing Rachel or Seth chasing Anna? Which is proof I watch too much 'Friends' and too much 'The O.C.'  If my relatives have internet access, there's a chance I may blog a bit from the Sunshine State, but it's doubtful I'll be updating much.  Enjoy the weather in  your  homestate, whilst I finally get a tan.

      Anyone who gets to know me relatively well will know that I hate my middle name.  So why, you ask, is the URL of my blog (and the username to my account at Blogger) iangerard?  Let me enlighten you.  I have always thought that Gerard would make a good last name, at least for me. Ian Gerard. It sounds like a clothing designer, and they always have great names. Maybe I think that way because I like to write a lot and, as all you bookworms out there will notice, author's are creative by instinct and love great names.  J.K. Rowling has admitted on several occasions that she "collects" strange names.  So, I pretend like Gerard is my last name, even though the sidebars will tell you it isn't.

      Today I woke up with Ben and Jason here; Mark had already left. They spent the night last night. I had told Drew I didn't want to have anyone over - I was exhausted - but he did.  Caitlin, Alicia, Emily, and Meghan came too and stayed until about 11:00. I had wanted Holly to come over, even though she and Meghan aren't getting along so well right now. Holly and I were best friends and I miss that about us, but I did talk to her for a while last night and it felt like nothing had changed. Maybe...  When I awoke though, I forgot completely that anyone was here because I had been having a rather pleasant dream (though I don't recall its subject now) when the phone rang. It was Joe, Jason's father, asking if he was here. So I had to wake Jason, and that's when I remembered people were here.  After getting showered and dressed, my mom took me to get my haircut. It's considerably shorter now, even though it wasn't that long. I guess it's good, because it would have grown in Florida and my hair combined with humidity is a result the likes of Monica in the last two episodes of the ninth season of 'Friends'.  Even though I don't pay for my hair to be cut (my parents do) I was a little surprised the fee was raised to $25.00, but I really like the way it's cut, and I like talking to Andrea and Flo about movies, and one of them usually cuts my hair.  My mom and I went to visit my great aunt (whom I call "Grandma" and will from here on be referred to as my grandmother) at her house, after my hair was cut. She gave me money for my report card to bring to Florida, which I don't understand because she's given me money "for my report card" multiple times now and since  she  is taking me to Florida, she'll probably pay for everything I really need or want there.  Now I'm preparing to go to work, which is something I don't want to do. It's not going to busy and I'm going to be bored, but at least I can talk to Stephanie a little bit, which is always good as she's the only truly interesting person there, other than maybe Ashley Dilley.  When I come home, I'm thinking I'll have my parents pick me up because I can walk home in two minutes, but there's a party going on at my neighbors' house and I'd feel awkward passing it on the way home. Of course, my parents may be there already, since we were actually invited for once...

      Won these on eBay. Brand new, authentic Louis Vuitton sunglasses purchased for $13.50 (a steal!).        (Images stored at Photobucket.com)  For those who say they're not "real"... the same seller was selling other, similar pairs for around $70.00, and all started out at $12.99, like these ones did.  If only the shipping hadn't been $7.00!

      I know it's old, but I like this song.&nbsp;I discovered&nbsp;Björk's music and this is such an amazing song. So here are the lyrics.  &nbsp;   You'll be given love    You'll be taken care of    You'll be given love    You have to trust it     &nbsp;   Maybe not from the sources    You have poured yours    Maybe not from the directions    You are staring at     &nbsp;   Twist your head around    It's all around you    All is full of love    All around you     &nbsp;   All is full of love    You just aint receiving    All is full of love    Your phone is off the hook    All is full of love    Your doors are all shut    All is full of love    All is full of love, all is full of love    All is full of love, all is full of love ...     &nbsp;  For more Björk lyrics, check out  urlLink http://www.alwaysontherun.net/bjork.htm

      Until these past few days, I wasn't as excited about going to Florida as I had expected myself to be. I'm finally beginning to feel the excitement building up every time I think about it.  Getting away from Meadville will be  so  nice. If you don't live in a small town, you don't understand the need to get away. There's no one new to meet and nothing new to see. Leaving and returning is refreshing like nothing else is.  As I await my plane's July 28th departure, I'm getting more and more anxious to just take a break from this dull, dismal place engulfed in disgusting weather. I can't wait to step onto the beach and feel the hot sand between my toes. To smell the salty air. To collect sea shells on the shore.  ...But I'll stop carrying on about the pleasures of the exotic state. I feel like I'm writing some disillusioned romance novel or something. And, now, I feel stupid.  Eleven more days... Maybe I'll buy some paperbacks to read on the beach...

      Boredom has settled in once again as I sit here trying to get my cat to stop rubbing my arm so I can type with more ease. I didn't really do anything today.  I woke up and Mark called, so I talked to him for a while. After that, I made myself lunch and watched 'Days of Our Lives'. I was laughing very hard at the "shark" in the water that was chasing after Hope and Patrick, and - later - Bo.  When 'Passions' was well into its second half, I set off for work and was again bombarded by swarming insects. My neighbors  really  need to call in an exterior exterminator. If one exists. Somewhere out there.  Work was really dull today, because there were about twelve people swimming and not one of them was hungry or in need of anything. So I basically stood there by myself while Chris (my employer) spent City money paying all the other workers to make confetti for her daughter's baby shower. Since no one was really there though, I just sort of hung out with Sarah and Stephanie and the lifeguard-trainees while I could. And Nick and Rachael, because they're always there when they're not supervising.  After work, my dad took me to Wal-Mart to pick out Mark's birthday present. His birthday was over a month ago, but his party's tomorrow. Which... is a little unusual, but still all good.  Immediately upon my return from Wal-Mart, I turned on 'I Love the 90s' and was thrilled to see a mention of 'Pulp Fiction'.  Then I got on the computer and was bombarded by messages from people wasting their time talking to me. I'm boring. And they should know that.  Right, and I think I'm changing the name of my blog. Eventually...

      Yesterday was Sunday and I didn't go to church. I haven't gone for weeks. This is a good thing.  I feel like I did something yesterday, but all I can bring to mind is sitting at home being bored. It's a strange feeling...   Six Feet Under  was on last night. A sigh is being released as I think about the show. It's so brilliant. And... oh, I just love it. I love everything about it. I love the humor; I love the various romance stories; I love that there is no set main plot but everything sort of falls together and occurs around everything else, like in real life; AND I love Ruth, but you already knew that.  Today I had to wake up at 9:45 to go to work at 11:00. Something weird in my mind always wakes me up before my alarm goes off... which is good, because that sound ranks amongst my biggest pet peeves.  Well, I went to work and the lightning and rain ( I HATE this town!! ) caused for the pool to close, so I suppose a pool cashier would have little do anyways. I guess I like my job, but I don't really. And I hate saying that I work at a pool but I'm not a lifeguard. People seem to expect me to be a lifeguard - why, I don't know. I don't exactly have the 'look' of one who lifeguards.  Mallory, my supervisor, called me back at 3:00 to come in and cashier again, so I went in because I need money and I figured I'd be bored at home anyway since 'Days' and 'Passions' were over and afternoon TV is the absolute worst.  The reason I was called in is rather humorous: Louise, the old woman who was supposed to be cashiering but she saw that the pool wasn't open so she drove off and even though the supervisors chased after her car, she didn't halt. That woman is insane, I swear!  I arrived home at about 7:00, talked to my grandma on the phone, and then I ate dinner. And now I'm sitting at my computer chair, wondering why if I'm going to watch 'North Shore' or not since I've missed so much of the series anyways.

      Well, I had the day off. I work again tomorrow from 3-7 which isn't something I'm happy about as this spoils my plans of going to Erie with Mark. I really wanted to see 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' again too.  Since I had my day off, I began cleaning for my mom, who has agreed to pay me $10 per hour to clean the house. I split it with Drew so it was supposed to clean for an hour and a half but my house was so messy that I just kept doing it for about five hours. So, go me, I made money on my day off!  After cleaning, I watched a couple hours of 'The Surreal Life' for the first time. It wasn't that funny nor was it that interesting, so I'm still not entirely sure what possessed me to watch it for so long.  I turned on the TV downstairs and got on the laptop and 'Friends' was on. It was the episode where Phoebe got married. It was one of the more unrealistic episodes, but I was glad to see it as it felt like Phoebe deserved to get married to someone. I'm a bit confused as to whether or not they reshow the whole seasons during the summer, because I would've thought this episode would have been on later.  Now that I've seen some 'Friends' tonight, I'll probably go watch the DVDs in my room. I watch them when I'm sad or when I'm in a good mood and want to feel even better. Is it pitiful that I honestly feel like they're my best friends? I could watch that show over and over and over again, and I feel close to the characters.  I'm weird, I suppose.

      Today was really boring.  I didn't have to go into work because it wasn't busy, which sucks because I need money and I need to see when I work for the rest of the week. Oh well, I can just go in early and look, I guess.  I hate work. And I hate Sarah. And I hate Kim. And I hate Chris. Why don't I just quit?  My life needs to become more exciting. I don't do anything, and I'm getting restless.  But for once I'm not at all looking forward to school.

      If you're reading this, you probably know me through the internet or through real life encounters.  However, I feel like I need to introduce myself as that's traditionally what we do in a first post. Why though? Isn't that why we have these web-journals; so people can get to know us?  The introduction to me is the body of postings that will occur here. If that's not sufficient and learning about my favorite movies and what not, read my profile. That's why those handy-dandy things come with the amazingly rennovated Blogger.  For the record, mainly generic thoughts will go here along with re-caps of my days, various song lyrics, quiz results, and that sort of general thing. I have a private blog for all that deep, personal stuff. It's doubtful you'll ever be able to find it, so don't even try.  Here's to many insightful moments yet to come.

      I think I want this read at my funeral.  "The reason death sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity - it's envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud." -Taken from Yann Martel's novel 'Life of Pi', pp. 6-7

      Nothing but boredom.  My mom's in the hospital. I think she's okay.  I don't want to go to Jason's tonight. I'm not in the mood for more boredom, playing video games.  I'm releasing a sigh right now.

      Florida was nice to visit. The weather wasn't very agreeable, allowing for me to visit the beach only once and lay in the sun only once. So I'm not very tan.  But I'm home now, and it feels good to be home. My parents remodeled my room while I was gone, and I like it... but for some reason, I don't like the idea of my parents going through everything in my room. I don't have anything to hide really, it's just the idea of someone being in my space. I don't even like to leave the door open when I'm not home.  I don't anyone will get the "Return of the Jedi" pun. But I'm tired, which explains the both the pun and why I'm not writing any more.
