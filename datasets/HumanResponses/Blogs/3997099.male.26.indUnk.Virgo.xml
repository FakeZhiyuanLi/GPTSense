      Setiap habis jum'atan, banyak orang yang menggelar dagangan di seputar pelataran mesjid deket kantor. Kalo pas beruntung kamu bisa dapet barang yang murah tapi bagus. Kadang aku sampe bingung...niatku ke mesjid itu buat solat jum'at atau shopping di 'Mall Mesjid" setelahnya...

      The office asked me to help out in a 3-day 'konsinyering' in Cisarua, Bogor,&nbsp;starting last Tuesday. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, 'konsinyering' means doing work in isolated place(hotels or resorts, mainly); away from phonecalls, meetings, and other everyday office activities. The aim of which is to get as much work done in predesignated amount of time.  Anyway, i found out that my boss only gave me two day permission, so i had to go back to Jakarta, somehow, this morning. I had two options: to go by bus or by train. It seemed like going by bus was the more convenient choice. I could simply&nbsp;board a bus from the street in front of the Hotel and ride to Kampung Rambutan, then i could board another to Gambir and complete the rest of the journey on foot. 15 minutes of it. But given the situation that today is indeed a weekday and traffic jam would be everywhere, even as near as the Ciawi Freeway-Gate. Chances are I would arrive in Jakarta somewhere near lunchtime. So train it is...  I planned to start at 5 a.m.. However, due to the failure of alarm clock i wasn't on the road until 6.&nbsp; I boarded a small angkot to Bogor. Since i was unfamiliar with the terrain, the driver offered some pointers. He agreed to drop me off at Sukasari and told me to board another 'angkot' to PLN from where I was to walk to Bogor railway station.&nbsp; By 6.30 i was in Sukasari. I thought i was making a good time because the last of Pakuan Express is at 7. How far can it be to the station? Can't be more than half an hour, right? After all, Bogor is a small city. Boy, was i a dumb ass...  The kind angkot driver then directed me to board another angkot that would take me to PLN. It was a pleasant journey at first. The angkot glided slowly but sure. However, after ten minutes, the driver began grumbling in Sundanese about the lack of passnger and the condition of the angkot business. He cursed the entire city official for the licence-granting policy that in his opinion was carried loosely. Too many angkots for too small a city. To make things worse, at a certain intersection he stopped. Literally, stopped. He decided to wait for more passengers, coompeting with hundreds of other angkots in the process. Minutes ticked by and i glanced at my watch. Things like this always happen when you're already late. It's already 7. I had missed the Pakuan. Nonetheless, i held my ground and be patient. Fifteen minutes and two additional passengers later the angkot moved on, driver still grumbling.  Finally, i reached the PLN and hurriedly walked to the station. I couldn't help noticing that Bogor wasn't really famous for its cleanliness or orderlyness. Vendors were everywhere, inhabiting spaces previously meant for pedestrians. The station at last! Hundreds of people already there. Most of them were already packed into economy class trains. I would ride on one of them if i miss the Pakuan. I had nothing against economy trains, except for...okay, you have to ride one of them to know what i'm saying...the train is a battleground in which you have to fight for space and defend yourself from the heat,&nbsp;pickpockets, mugger, and sex perverts. Pakuan, however, is a different story. It has air conditioner, fairly comfortable benches and the best part is it doesn't stop at every station from Bogor to Jakarta Kota. It's 7.30 and the last of the Pakuans had departed..........or maybe not?  Indonesia Railway Service is notorious for its unpunctuality, if there is such word as 'unpunctuality'. Bottom line is, if the notice board at the station says that your train will arrive at 9, it actually means 10.30 at the earliest. However, this morning i was glad of that 'unpunctuality'. As i walked to the nearest economy ticket booth i noticed that the Pakuan booth was still open. I rushed in and bought my self a ticket. The train was about to depart..30 minutes off schedule. So went in and enjoyed the spacious ride....at 9.30 i was back at the office. I still missed the morning attendance check, though...

      Gosh! i woke up just as Chris Kennedy, the referee, blew the half time whistle. I cursed myself for missing the first half actions. Now i had 15 minutes to made my self some coffee, take a quick bath and prepare myself for the second half.  I did so and was in front of the TV promptly as the ref signalled the beginning of the second 45 minutes of football match between Liverpool and AS Roma. From the commentator, i learnt that the halftime score was 1-1. AS Roma opened the score and was promptly retaliated by Liverpool's new signing Djibril Cisse.  Liverpool turned up with their usual lacklustre performance that made me wonder why i root for this club at the first place. It was all about deep defending and occasional counterattack.Riise and Murphy made sporadic runs at the left and right flank respectively but the crosses never found the right customer. It was Roma who came close to scoring at 55th minute. Panucci drove a fleeting cross from the left and Candela hit the post from less than 6 yards. Panucci had another go at the hour mark when his curved shot hit the bar with Dudek at no man's land. The rebound fell to Candela but he couldn't quite connect. This time Dudek was right where all Liverpool fans around the world wanted him to be. In response to this battery, Murphy fired a freekick a mile high.  It was beginning to look like a bad day at the office for Michael Owen who had been prowling harmlessly at the front without firing a single shot, until the 85th minute. Following a Liverpool counter-attack, Roma's defender clearance rebounded off Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamman and the ball fell right into the path of the last man you want to see unmarked in the box . Yep, Michael Owen. Calm as a coma, the Liverpool man fired a thunderous shot with surgical precision past the goalkeeper. The poor man didn't stand a chance whatsoever.  The goal sparked a new life to the match. In the last 5 minutes Roma players besieged the Anfield boys. They came close to equalizing several times but Liverpool fought tooth and nail to secure the victory and the Kops got what they came there to see. Final score: Liverpool 2 - AS Roma 1.

      A friend of mine called the other day. He's working for Jakarta Post and currently working on an article about DAU (Dana Alokasi Umum-General Allocation Fund). Since it is the core business of my department he thought he'd see me and get a rough picture before he interviewed a higher ranking officer.  So i made a copy of the material and on the appointed time we met and go through it over lunch, which consisted of an excellent portion of fried rice and chicken in sesame oil. He's one hardworking son of a bitch, i got to hand it to him. He worked his way up from various pulp-newspapers before finally landed a lucrative job at the Post.  During the course of the discussion, he suddenly stopped, looked around, we were eating at a cafeteria in BUMN building by the way, and muttered," You know, back then at the university, who would have thought that one day you and me will be sitting here discussing economics..." He's got a point there. We both hated economics. I used to shudder with disgust everytime i had to translate economic texts. I did it anyway, though. I needed the money.   During the days in jogja, aeons ago, our topic of conversation, drunk or sober,  was limited to movies, games, lectures, girls and ways to cheat during exams. We spent sleepless nights watching pirated movies (back then we couldnt even afford to rent original VCDs) or trying to find ways to defeat Zerg Armies in Starcraft. I proofread his graduating paper making sure he didnt make too many grammatical errors. He lent me his motorcycle so i could go out on dates. There were so many financial exchange between us i forgot who owes who..and how much.. We went on road trips and planned class outings. He arranged every detail of my Student Association Chairman campaign...My other friend and i went to Jakarta to calm him down when his 6-year girlfriend dumped him..  Yet, who would have thought? Who would have thought he and i would end up where we are now? I have always thought that i would end up being a teacher and live peacefully in Jogja. And he..god knows what he wanted to be..he kept changing his mind every two seconds..one day he wanted to work for the UN and the the next day he announced that he wanted to start an internet business. Who would have thought?  Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get, said Ol' Forrest gump.  Life is a roller coaster..or in my case, maybe a merry-go-round..  Anyway, whatever life is..a hair-raising rollercoaster or a peaceful merry-go-round..i'm old enough to learn that you better enjoy the ride..
