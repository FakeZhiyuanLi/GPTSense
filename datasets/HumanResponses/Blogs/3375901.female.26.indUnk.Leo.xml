      5/22 is my younger sister's birthday!!! But on Saturday I slept over so when I woke up, she's gone out already. She went to gym with my mother so I cooked cheese cake for her. My father went to dentist 'cause he ached his throat of bad cold and he ate candy to decrease his throat ache but his teeth became cavity so he must go to a dentist. I wish he find the way how to lose ache of his throat another way. I presented my sister album of photograph she wanted. Now she's preparing go to work, she works as a receptionist at sport gym. She's very beautiful so she seems to be popular at working place. She likes dancing so she goes to dance school 3 times a week. I'm proud of her very much and I love her. She's very kind to me but also she's selfish on me maybe I'm too kind to her.

             This movie hit in Japan and I love it, too. I like Bruce Willis he is sexy and charming. I like the most characeter he played the role in this movie, I cried very much at the scene which he decided to leave a planet alone and he pushed his daugter's fiance back to the ship and he told to him that he thought about him like his son. I like SF movie from childhood. The movie's song hit in japan, too. "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith when I hear this song, I remind this movie and I'm impressed. Also I like Liv Tyler she is beautiful. Maybe I'm Japanese so I like actress with black hair I feel they're beautiful. I like Sandra Block, too. Sometimes I see Armageddon again and again. I don't get bored even if how many times I see this movie.

             This is very famous mystery in Japan. The animation airs in Japan, now. This story took the place in Germany. There was a talented Dr. his name was Tenma. One day he saved twins children's lives. But the kid he saved grew up to be a serial killer. Tenma felt guilty for saving his life and he tailed and searched his crimes. Also police thought these crimes done by Tenma. Really interesting and terrified story. And sometimes it makes us to realize what important thing is. Tenma had a courage, believes and justice. There appeared unique foreign characters they had problems and Tenma solved them. I think it entartained not only Japanese,any one in the world, too.

      I like rainy days there is "Tuyu" the specially season in Japan when it rains so much. The season is during end of May to June. Some people doesn't like rainy days but I like it. I like moist air and I like to hold umbrella, too. Rainy days I feel to settle down myself. Today, I bought my sister's birthday present her birthday is coming this Saturday and I boght shirt for my father with my mother. Yesterday my mother bought me pink cloth so I put it on and I like it very much. I extended my term to work Accenture as job secretary to end of June. I renew my contract every month so the man of charge of employment agency gives me e-mail every month and returned it. I like this job maybe I like the people who work there. They are good person and they are kind to me always. It is lucky for me and I'd like to work for them. I work only twice a week and afternoon only because I believe free-time is precious for me. My hobby is watching program my favorite animation and reading books and writing mail or diary or mail-magazine. Nowadays I started to invest of Foreign currency so I need time to do my favorite things. Also I am weak at stress and I have head-ach so I decrease my stress for myself. I'm interested in investment now and making money, my dream is to be a writer or a singer or a president of my company. I wish my dreams come true and I believe it.

             I like Disney Video from childhood. At that time, of course I enjoyed it in Japanese and now fortunately sometimes I understood when watching them in English. I have this Video, too. I like this story and caracters. Sally has kindful mind and he sincerely thinks about baby boo and Mike is very funny and unique. I like the scene Mike on TV but company's title hid him but he didn't care about and he was very glad and happy his show on TV. I have many Didney's movies and I also love to go Tokyo Disneyland. Disney video and DVDs much help me to learn English and I enjoyed it very much!

      Today, at noon time Mom and my sister and I had brunch together. My mother favorites Dotour cafe so we often goes there with her. I took a cup of coffee and bagle(I don't know exactly words) sandwiches with chiken and egg. The bagle is mixed with sesami and very delicious!  After the brunch, we went to shop and there was sale for clothes so Mom bought me top cloth pink one. I love pink cloth but I must go to office so sometimes I have to buy classic one. (I mean colorful clothes don't suit at office sometimes) but these days I don't care. Mom and sister decided to go to jazz piano concert that afeternoon so my rule it to cook dinner. I love to cook and today, I cooked "Torijaga" soup with chiken and carrot and potatos and onion with soy sorce and japanese sake and "dashi"(buillon?). Another I made 2 kind of dishes. My father praised my dinner.

At first, we ride on Spiderman's attraction, and I like "WaterWorld"'s stage. Also we all liked "Back to the Future" attraction. We had a good time, only me living apart from Osaka so it's rare time to spend together. I like to go out with my friends and we promised to go out or trip somewhere again together. Wonderful trip to Osaka last weekend!!!
