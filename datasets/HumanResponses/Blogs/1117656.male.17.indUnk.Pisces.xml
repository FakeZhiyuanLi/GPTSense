      Well, apparently some vampire-obsessed guy decided to make a comment on Mandie's previous post, which is a little odd.  But, whatever, at least somebody saw our happy new blog!  Onto business.  Last night my parents stayed out at the farm, so therefore I stayed up until about 1:30 watching tv and whatnot.  My brother just got back from Goshen taking his motorocycle test.  Since he's and Anderson, of course he passed with flying colors, along with very positive comments by the lady that tested him.  Right now I'm listening to some music by Low, and waiting for Mandie to come over after work at Subway.  I'm hoping to see  urlLink The Terminal  sometime this weekend.  Looks like a pretty entertaining movie, if not a little bit shallow and predictable and whatnot.    Tonight, as I said before, is the FFH concert.  Should be a good one.    8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride. 9 Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.    These verses from  urlLink Ecclesiastes 7  stuck out for me today.  To me verse 8 speaks of our complete ignorance of God's plan for our futures.  While things may at times seem hopeless in the present, if we trust in God, we can  always  know that He has something truly wonderful planned for us.  Verse 9, along with Verse 8, remind us once again of one very simple truth with my youth pastor has made it a point to make very clear.  He is God and we are not.  When we become prideful, all we are really doing is pretending that whatever good thing we did, we did by ourselves.  On the contrary, God is the one who does these things  through  us.  When we become prideful, could that not mean that we were really doing those things for ourselves, and not for God?  And, if that's true, then are they really good things (the goodness of the action is separate from who does it, but us doing it for ourselves isn't pleasing to God)?  Only a fool would think that he had any power on his own to do good.  In that same respect, how do we have any right to become angry?  Wouldn't becoming disappointed with someone's actions, and therefore angry, be in a way putting ourselves in the place of God?  "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone," is a verse that comes to mind immediately when thinking about anger.  We are in no place to judge others, and become angry, as we are nowhere near to perfection ourselves. Anyway, those were just some things that came to me in thinking about my devotions today.  I hope that perhaps my thoughts can be useful to others.  Also, if anyone would like to add to what I said, or found error in any of it, feel free to comment!  Well, that's about all for right now!  God bless, all!  Until whenever, Bob

      So, here I am again, sitting in this same old chair that my great grandma gave to us before she died.  It is again 11:38p.m.... like it always is when I'm sitting here.  I've got my lap top turned on to the brightest screen setting (a big no-no by my brother, Jesse's standards) so that I won't nod off before I say goodbye and goodnight to my favorite guy. (Bob, if you haven't guessed)  I'm dressed in my dad's big orange t-shirt and have found myself to be quite comfortable, in this chair in the corner of my room.  Today I went to see my best friend Laura... we had a great time chatting, but she seemed to be easily distracted by the frequent interruptions of her dog, Sophie.  We spent a bit to much time messing with that mutt, but I suppose it was fun.  Today was a day for a first for me.  I learned how to Cha- Cha... well, I hope Bob will find my new talent intriguing.  I never knew I could dance!  It's quite fun!  Well, I must be off. Bob is dying to see this blog thing run, and I need to get to bed.  I have to brush my teeth, wash my face and drink some water... (hopefully that will rid me of my horrid stomach ache) I have to go back to work tomorrow, so that means I actually have to go to bed at a... well, soon.  Tomorrow is another day!   I'm sure I'll be able to sleep, once my mind is able to ignore my father's snoring in the next room... Oh well, I love him!  He needs the sleep.  As for now! God bless!  Whatever is true, whatever is honerable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is admariable, whatever is worthy of good repute, if anything is excellent or worthy of praise... DWELL on these things!  (somewhere in Philippians!)

          So, got back from the Davy Jones concert.  Well, I left early.  Why?  It was oh, so stupid.  Almost as bad as Paul Revere and the Raiders, only not as loud.    Tomorrow night FFH will be playing.  They're not too bad.  A little poppy, but at least not as annoying.  The opening singer is  urlLink Tiffany Polston !  She's the young woman who's recording music right now through  urlLink Servant Records/Studios , which is the new recording studio at  urlLink Intercomm  (formerly Ken Anderson Films), which is where my dad works.  And, that was a bunch of hullabaloo you probably didn't care to hear!  On a happier note, Mandie doesn't work tomorrow, so therefore I'll be able to see her at and before the concert.  She's a cute one, so that's always a good thing.  Oh yes, haven't mentioned her before... she's my girlfriend of over 7 months, and she's... cool!  I'm really boring, aren't I?  Maybe if I get bored later I'll upload some pictures for you... all... well... nobody knows I've made this yet.  Neveryoumind.    Until whenever, rla

      So, today, I finally rediscovered this bloggin business.  I don't quite know that I'll actually ever use this, but hey, whatever!  Anyway, today I didn't do a whole lot.    Woke up, took my sister to Petro's to get her car.  Silly paradise music store doesn't open until 10, apparently, so I'll have to wait even longer before I actually BUY a capo for my guitar.  I'm going to the Davy Jones (or something, he's a Monkee) concert in a little while, and that's about it!  Until whenever,  me

        Mandie and I are going to see some Brahms: Symphony No. 2 tonight at 7:30.  Masterworks is a free concert festival thing that's in Winona Lake every year.  This will be the first time either of us have ever gone, so it should be at least something different.  I'm picking her up at 6:30 from work, so I have a while until then to get everything done that I have to do.  I woke up at 5:30 this morning.       Today was the 11th Optimist Club triathlon.  As my dad is in Optimist Club, and my brother is heading to Russia, I got to help!  So, we went there, set stuff up, sat around... I punched 500 3-digit numbers into a clock thingy, which wasn't actually of any real use, as it was merely a backup for their high tech runner detector... thing.  So, I spent until about 11 doing that.  My dad and I brought all the junk back to the studio (Intercomm), and then we headed back to eat some pierogies.  Good stuff.  Upon arriving home, I mowed the lawn.  Now, here I am.  Last... Monday?... and wednesday... me, Rod, and Mandie went fishing at my aunt's house.  I tell you $14.25 for a stinking fishing license?  Oy.  Anyway, that's a fun thing.  Yes, children, fishing doesn't have to be just for old people.  Youngin's can enjoy an evening of fishing, as well!  Well, most of the time we didn't really fish too much, but it was still fun.  I'm stinky.  I need a shower.  Until whenever, Bob

      I have found that when a person ASKS you to talk about yourself you can't find the words to say.  I have previously been commissioned by my mother to write college essays today, and for some reason I can't seem to find the words... or more than that... what order to put them in if I were to happen to stumble upon them.  It seems as though all I am writing about my life is pure fluff.  And that can get a might bit depressing.   If you care to look, I am posting my rough rough rough rough (etc) draft essay for Taylor and Grace on my Blog.  Please do keep everything in perspective... I am a poor dumb homeskewed girl who can't write... well who can write by the grace of God.    And it seems that God has bestowed a little more of that grace upon others.  Furthermore, I have found that my life isn't a sad pathetic mess, my writing just makes it look that way.  I suppose that that could be encourageing.  (weak smile)  My week has been going great.  The Lord has blessed me with wonderful friends, good health, and warm sunshine!  Now how happy is that?  Yesterday Bob, Rod, Laura, and I went swimming at Laura's aunt's pool.  We froze our patuschki's off, but we had a good time.  It's one of the blessings and mystries of cold weather, the water seems so much warmer if you are under it as opposed to standing outside dripping wet.  I learned this fact very quickly.  After that we ate some schrum... schrumschoooss...schrum....yeah... some very good cake that Laura made and all went over to my house to watch Fiddler on the Roof. Good movie. I like Jews. I guess I "have lived" now.  According to my fine fellow friends I have "never lived until I had seen that movie"... now I am complete.  When that LOOOOOOOONG movie was over, we engaged ourselves in a rousing game of poker which was simply delightful.  Especially when everybody had to leave in a hurry to get home before 12 and left all the "poker chips" with me.  (We played with M&M's)  So now I am just sitting here, typing my life away.  Probably boring you.  I'll write something more interesting tomorrow.  Oh! Tomorrow!  After my shift at Subway I am going to go listen to a Brahm's concert in Winona Lake!  I'm so very excited.  If you aren't interested in classical music, I suggest that you look into it at least.  It is a very noble topic, and quite enjoyable!  Well that's all for now.  I pray you have a wonderful day, as I have! God Bless you all! In His service, Mandie  	"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strenth, and my redeemer."   Ps. 19:14

      Hello everybody!  I've finally gotten on here.  And guess what?  My name will show up as Laura.  Wow, don't you feel better now Robert;).  Well, I somewhat skimmed through the different things that you guys have written, and since there is absolutely NO ONE online......oh weird.... just as I was typing that Mandie signed in.  But onward.    Well, by now I can't barely remember anything about the posts, but someone said something about not being angry, which I do agree that we should try not to be angry, but I think that we are allowed to be angry because somewhere in the Bible it says that "In your anger, do not sin."  I could look up where that is at, but I am to lazy at the moment.  So basically we can feel angry, but we can't let that anger lead us to bad thoughts or actions.  I wish that I could remember more from the other posts, but I don't.    Oh, Mandie talked about us learning to cha-cha.  I think that we could become a great dancing couple, maybe even good enough to teach others~so watch out guys~we'll be on the move to get others to dance with.  Although, it is kind of confusing sometimes.    Oh my goodness!  I just found out that Rod got poison something on his hands and they're huge.  So much for that idea. lol.  Well, a basic update on my life would probably be fitting for a blog.    Well, currently I am updating our teeny tiny kitchen.  We have flat dark cabinets that are about 40 years old.  To update our kitchen, I have removed all of the doors, scrubbed down them all with TSP, and rinsed them.  Now I have to add wood filler in the holes, cracks, and dents, and then sand them all.  Then my dad and I are adding trim around the edges, which we have to cut, then glue, and then tack on.  After that I'm going to do more filling in the cracks, and sanding.  Then prime all of them, sand a bit, and paint.  Whew!  A lot of work.  But I can handle it.  I know that you guys probably didn't want to read through all of the steps, but I typed them so that I could remember them.  Also we're going to add new counter.  That should be interesting because the backsplash goes all the way up to the cabinets, and we don't want the new counter to go up that high, and we're not sure what is behind the backsplash.  So we might have to have drywall, or something added between the cabinets and new backsplash.  We're also going to get more cabinets, and make it so that our dishwasher hooks into the wall, add a sink, paint the paneled walls.  So I'll be busy busy busy!    Well, through out writing this thing I have had a good talk with Mandie and I have managed to make things not so good with my mom, which bothers me, but not too much because my mom and I are close so we always get good again.    Well, it is late and I should go to bed.  Good night and farewell.

       Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking part that wonders What the part that isn't thinking isn't thinking of  I don't have much deep thought to put into my post today, so I thought I'd just throw that in to perhaps confuse, or enlighten, some people.  Yesterday, Mandie, Rod and I had a jolly good time.    It was around noon, and I was bored.    I called Rodney.  "You wanna do whatever with me and Mandie?"  "Sure"  "Bye"  I then proceeded to call Mandie, asking her to come over and... do whatever.  Us three kiddos sat around a bit... watched some stupid tv... and I finally resolved to call my aunt.  She said it'd be wonderful if us three came over and fished.  And fish, we did.  Rodney, the pro, of course caught most of the fishies.  Mandie and I came in second/third with "not as many fishies."  However, the expidenture was quite a fun time.    And then we left.  And then we saw The Terminal.  I say it was a quite good movie.  There was some Stupidity of People in it, but this Stupidity of People  was generally not put in Good Light.  So, hey.  Yes, it was very far-fetched at times, but what do you really expect from a movie about a guy who gets stuck at an airport?  After this viewing of said movie, we then went to my house.  Why?  Pizza, of course.  Oh, and pizza we did!  We pizza-ed all night long, we did.  Then people went home.  Then I went to sleep.  Oh, yes, yes, yes I did.   There's something coming. There's a new car on the horizon. It's coming very slowly. It makes a noise. It has kittens painted all over it. With a new kind of fur. Cleaner, but with a unique smell. Yet, one of these kittens is not prepared to have a good time. It stands alone. Away from the crowd. It's your kind of kitten. Now the time has come to climb into that car and to shake the paw of destiny.   I went on a good long walk with my sister.  There's a very cool walkway through some marsh land in our town, so it's always fun to walk down there, walk across it, then walk home from the other side.  Good hour walk, at least.  Clint and Rod are over here now.  They're playing video games, so I figured it was my duty to enlighten the world with my thoughts about whatnot and whatnot.  Um, wow, I'm probably really boring.  Maybe I'll post something interesting later.  As for now, Until whenever, Bob

      Through my 17 years of experience, more notably the later half of my 17 years, I've noticed the sickly devil called Reason as being one of my main enemies.  He is one who tends to slither into my mind on occasions when I thought that I might have had control of the situation.  Reason adorns himself with many different habiliments, according to the job that he is performing at the time.  Often enough he is non-threatening, presenting himself as a mere excape to a difficult situation.  In that sense my using reason is praised.  A soldier would rather have his commanding officer use reason when staging an attack on the enemy as opposed to feeling and emotion. But I also believe that reason is becoming the downfall of my generation.  Webster's dicionary calls reason: a statement offered in explanation or justification; the power to think, intellect.  Coming from the Latin word ratio, in reference to computation, it provides for analization of a situation.  Thinking and re-thinking and using one's intellect until he comes to justification of his actions. In it's entirety I don't believe that reasoning is wrong, it is the mis-use of reason that transforms it into a monster.   I have see so many young people like me "reason" their way out of guilt and consequences to their actions.  Just as if sex were misused, outside (or perhaps inside) the context of marriage, it no longer is a beauty but a defilement of what the Lord had intended it to be.  Many false religions and as I would call it (I know, I'm creating a new word today) "mal-philosophy" are based around the misuse of reason.  Justification, in human terms is a sick word.  Going hand-in-hand with Reason it rebukes conviction,  implying that we "deserve better for ourselves, because we had been good on such-and-such an occason" therefore allowing the human to ignore the consequences and fall deeper into sin.  I work at the only local fast-food restraunt in the neighborhood, and I often see the same people comming in, day in and day out.  Because I work on a line, I have been able to strike up conversations with some of our regular costumers.  Some have remarked that they had been "good" that day, (pertaining to what they had eaten) so they deserve a little extra topping on their sandwhich, or perhaps a cookie or two.  I'm not saying this is inherently evil, the point I am driving at is that we believe we deserve something from life, and that we in fact, Reason it to be so.  "I have been good by not having kissing or having sex, therefore I deserve favor from him or her"  or  "My mom should commend me for doing the dishes and laundry for her and for not arguing today, so why is she nagging me?  I deserve better treatment"  We haven't changed our position in life, God is still God.  All our thinking, reasoning, and intellect, won't change that fact.  We are all slaves to someone (God or Satan), and we all deserve nothing.  I pray that we destroy our self-centered way of thinking and get focused on Who matters.  The little devil Reason that we have created will only drag us deeper into sin.  I pray for my generation also, that we will, by His strength, pull out of the mire that has been laid before us by our predecessors and by ourselves, and look upward, toward the call of Jesus Christ.  What I deserve is death, what He gave was life, and that is something my intellect and reason can never understand.

      Today was actually a very nice day.  I got up, I went to sunday school, I went to church, I came home, hung out with Rob and then went to work.  I think this would be the absolute defintion of a "nice" day.   5 Reasons for Mandie's Nice Day:  1.) There was a pretty sunset on the way home, and that's always a nice reminder of good things.  I'm a sunset girl, I guess. 2.) Bob came over... that's always nice to hang out with a good friend.  We did devo's together.  (Oswald Chambers: My Utmost for His Highest.  If you ever get a chance, read that! it's good!) 3.) I worked with my good friend Danielle and we gabbed like silly girls about our boyfriends.  That was fun, in an immature kind of way. 4.) I sat and chatted with family.   My family is good at chatting too.  You should try just talking with your mom or dad sometime... just say something that you know wouldn't tick them off.  It's nice! 5.) It's Sunday, I love church... I love getting fed the Word! Praise Jesus!   I'm trying to see my sunday school in somewhat of a different light.  I have recently had a hard time with sunday school because the teacher is, well, at times, hard to follow.  If you asked anybody what the lesson was about today, I am guessing that they couldn't tell you.  (Now, we did just finish a {year long} series that explained to us that "He is God, and we are not."  That is one point that I think you'd have to be deaf if you did not get.)  But he has a heart for us, and I believe my being there, as a Senior in the class, is an encouragement to him... so I go, every Sunday...  Also if I think about it this way, I am getting food for the soul.  Even things that seem below me, very simple concepts... oftentimes I need a reminder of the fact that He is God, and I am not, and sometimes I need it ingrained into my memory.  I won't readily forget that phrase... and so I am grateful.  Well, I am a bit sleepy, so I shall be going soon, but before I do I want to make a comment about something very dear to me---  I have seen such exemplory growth in knowledge towards the Lord Jesus from my best friends.  I have made it a point to pray for both of them, and It is so heartwarming to see them seek truth, affirm knowledge, and grow in their faith.  If there is something they don't understand, the search for that understanding.  They don't seem to settle for half-hacked faith, and that is so important to me.  Oftentimes Christians are spoon-fed their faith, but I have seen my dear friends find meaning to their life, and closer understanding of their Savior... and they are just cool... I mean, they like chickens.  Wow, that's another story... hmmm, come to think of it, we've all raised chickens.  Man, we are hicks!  Well, I'd best be getting to bed.  At least heading in that direction anyway.  I'll probably read some of my book (I love summer!)  It's called This Present Darkness, by Frank Peretti.  If you liked C.S. Lewis's Screwtape Letters, I'd highly advise this book  It's good!  Well goodnight for now! God bless all!  Mandie  Because He lives, I can face tomorrow! Because He lives, all fear is gone! Because I know, He holds my future, and life is worth the living, just because He lives!

      Yes, the muscle around my knee... is twitching?  Why?  Please, tell me.  I have no idea, and it's  weird .  Went to sunday school and church this morning.  Both went quite well.    After church, I went to Mandie's house.  Isn't it funny how I assume things?  After church, I called my parents to ask what they were doing, my dad picks up, and the first thing he says is "yes you can."  He automatically assumed that I already had planned to go out to lunch with Mandie's family.  Thing is, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, and I was merely asking what  they  had planned for the day, as it is father's day.    Anyway, they said they were going out to the farm, so I decided to go to Mandie's, and "be a gentleman," and "keep my paws off of her."  They say they trust me, but they don't every quite act like it!  Or, maybe it's just a big joke?  Maybe parents really  are  robots.  I don't quite know.  However, they are quite silly.  Either way, I still got to see Mandie, not having planned on "putting my paws on her" in the first place.  Oy.  Anyhoo, racing to Mandie's house was fun.  If you're ever bored, go north of 30 and west of 15... Clunette is cute little town.  After Mandie's went back to church for youth groups and stuff.  And then, Bob's brother beckons him to clean the garage... joy of joys!    Until whenever, Bob

      What a lovely day for fireworks!  60% chance of rain; thunderstorms; severe weather.  I don't think God wanted us out this 4th of July.  Oh well, I don't mind, I don't have anything going to speak of.  I was going to go watch fireworks with Bobby this evening, but if you could sit here with me right now, you would know why I am not going. (and I kinda did it yesterday.  Dane Miller, owner of "Daneville" (Winona Lake) had his personal show at his lake house, and Bob and I watched it from his aunt Margrets house)  So, I am at home.  It's so nice.  I am the kind of person who likes to be out and about, but it is nice to be here right now.  I just got out of a warm bath, so I feel clean and fresh.  I put on smelly lotion, so I feel good from that too.  No I am sitting on my bed, lost in a sea of pillows and stuffed animals.  I have my fan going and a few lights on, just for effect.  "May it Be" by Enya, is playing in the background... and in all... I feel gooooooooood!  Laura lent me a book called "Will the Real Hereitc Please Stand Up."  Yeah, yeah, cheesy I know, but it's actually good!  It kinda compares and contrasts Christians from the early church with those from the modern church.  I love that kind of study, so I am finding it quite enjoyable!  Work today went ok.  I wish I wasn't the way I am.  I have a tendancy to get stressed out when I am working alone.  I am constantly trying to make everything perfect, but when so many people come in, it's so difficult to finish things just right.  Oh well, I'll get better, I suppose.  By God's grace, I'll make it!  I'm very excited, I'm going to take Sarah Chamberlin to church tomorrow!  I haven't seen her in forever! it will be so nice to see here again.  Well, I could comment on life and love and happiness... but I'll drone on about that on my blog.  For now, I am going to go brouse the Taylor website.  Ta ta for now!  Because He Lives, Mandie

      Here I am, and here'll I be, for the rest of my life, teedle dee dee. I'll always be here, where ever I go, whether it'll have sun, or it'll have snow.   Because here tends to travel, round the world, and through time.   Now the question is, whether to continue this rhyme.  I think I will, because a brief explanation is in order, or else, the state of confusion you would border. For how can here travel through time? I must explain it to you not in rhyme. For you see, I used to be here and now I am there, or is it I used to be there and now I am here. I think that this confusion must end, there are more pressing matters for me to attend.  So now I will end this, right here and right now, some day I might solve this, but I don't know how.  Ah ha!  The ridiculous poetry of Laura has returned.  Robert knows little of this.  Mandie knows some of it.  I LOVE to write poetry.  Sometimes I write about meaningful things~Mandie knows about this.  A lot of the time, I write about just ridiculous things.  Many times my poems don't make sense, and are kind of stupid, but they are fun to write, and they don't take me long to write~dumb rhymes pop in my head all of the time.  Well, enough of that nonsense.  Onward and upward they say.    Well, let's see.  I should write about what I did today.  Well, I worked on my knitted article of clothing for the fair~I think Mandie knows what it is~I  would say what it is, but then I would forever be labeled as a grandma:).  Also, I made supper~yea ra, go me~lol.    Furthermore, I went to a viewing for Howard~an AWESOME old guy at my church.  I must say that viewings creep me out.  Luckily this one wasn't too bad, because people were just talking about normal things most of the time and you didn't have to be by the casket long.  It's just that, now a days, they make people look so alive when they're dead, that it seems like they could just reach up and grab you.  Freaks me out.  I say, make them look deader~not super dead~but not like they are alive enough to do anything~or my favorite~CLOSE THE LID!  Well enough of that~oh mandie, it was awesome, he had a Bible in his hands, but near him was a pack of gum and something else.  I thought that was awesome.    Before the viewing, Mandie and Robert walked over to my house, which was awesome.  I like doing things in Milford with the group~cheaper on gas:).  But Warsaw is good also.  Since Bob says that this is just for us three, I will include other info.  I like hanging out with more than three.  I don't know, I'm weird.  Or I should put it this way, I like to hang out not just with a couple, even if the couple is as well behaved as Mandie and Bob are.  And so, Mandie knows this, but I'm not totally sure that Bob does, when I ask about whether Rod is going to do stuff with you guys also, it is not for romantic reasons.  It is just because I like to have at least one other noncouple person.  Like it would be ok if it was Clint Sarah Me and (Mandie, or Robert, or Rod).  Or if it was Robert Mandie me and (Clint or Sarah or Rod).  I don't so much like it when it is Clint Sarah Mandie Bob and Me. because then there is no other noncouple person there.  I know that this is silly, and Bob will probably not understand, because on a lot of these type issues guys are different, although on this one he might understand.  So, that entire explanation was just for you to know that when I ask about Rod coming that it is not for romantic reasons.  Now, I do not feel like I will ever have to touch this subject again, and I will feel freer to ask. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........   Oh..............It's late, I should go to bed.  I am horrible about going to bed.  Seriously, I think I am part owl, or raccoon.  It's like I come alive at night.  This is off of the subject but mandie I found out what the purdue young group's website is if you want to look it over.    Also, I saw Armageddon the other night, and I cried my eyes out.  So sad.  I cry when I think of it now.    Well, I really need to go to bed.  This has been a pretty ridiculous post.  But I am too tired to read back through it to edit it.  Goodnight everyone and sweet dreams. Luv ya, ~Laura

      ...how I think of wonderful things to talk about in here during the day, but when it comes down to it, I can't remember what I was thinking.  It's also funny how, now that it's summer, it's almost impossible sometimes to remember what I did the past couple of days.  Oh yes, yesterday, after church, Mandie and I went out to the farm to have a little chicken picnic at the farm with my parents.  Yes, this was chicken that we took from the triathlon.  It was good chicken.  Last night Clint, Rod and I spent the night out at "the farm."  This "the farm" actually goes by the name Treehouse Farm, and is owned by my grandparents of sorts.  They bought it long ago for family and ministry use, and it holds many great memories for me.  For the longest time some very slobby people from Grace College had been staying out there, but we finally kicked them out.  After this, we cleaned it up quite a bit, and now we stay out there sometimes.  We burned some stuff, which was fun.  It's amazing how difficult it is to make a pop can explode in a fire.  Ok, we only tried once and gave up, but that's life.  Making pancakes is something every teenage boy should do.  It's fascinating how I manage,  every  time I make pancakes to mess up the first couple, then make the rest just fine.  Either way, they all tasted great.  It's also amazing how easy it is to make bacon.  My friends are bums.  I tell you, they do not know how to clean, unless someone is telling them  exactly  what to do.  Yes, they did take it upon themselves to lock up the mini barn (this is a small barn-type thing, which we've fixed up with couches and a projector and whatnot), and they left the air conditioner, and lights on.  Wouldn't these things be obvious things to turn off when locking up?  Obviously not.  Or maybe it's just them.  It's in this area that I really do have to commend Mandie.  She says that not all guys are this stupid, which is likely, but either way Clint and Rod are the only long-time guy friends I've made that aren't busy all the time.  However, Mandie is in now way like this.  The whole time they were walking around, not cleaning at all, I was thinking how much I wish Mandie could just stay out there with me.  Other than the "appearance of evil" (see: silly parents), it would be much nicer.  Unlike my friends, Mandie goes out of her way to do helpful things.  Mandie asks me how she can help with things?  I mean, if I was the only one making a mess, I'd be fine.  But I actually made  them  breakfast, and they had very little gratitude to show for it.  Mandie, I love you.  You're truly the best, best friend I could ever ask for.       Anyhoo, we also watched Return of the King.  I do tell you, that is good cinema, apart from the fact that it was in fullscreen, which is a disgrace.  I made $45 for mowing tonight.  I mowed the studio (Intercomm), on a riding mower, which got me $25.  Then, I mowed my grandma's, which got me $20.  Although I do have to go back to both places and do some weed-whacking, I'd give it an A+.  Tomorrow Mandie and I are going to Mishawaka.  More on that tomorrow or sometime.  Other than that, I have not much more to say.  I could attempt getting into some deep theological stuff, but I'm too tired.  Until the future, Bob

      Hello everybody!  It is late and my allergies are really bad(I look like a drunk/heroine addict right now) and I'm kind of tired, but I thought that I would write a bit before I go to bed.  Well, actually now that I think about it, I don't really have anything to write about.  I have not done a whole lot lately, just cleaned and knitted.  And for all of you people who are freaked about me going around and being pushy about having everyone go on the road trip, I would not worry.  I've  been thinking about it, and well, next year whenever is the college spring break I'll most likely go on a missions trip to someplace in Mexico or Guatemala most likely, and then over spring break I'm probably going to get to go AGAIN to Florida with my family, so I should probably hold off on the traveling.  But I have not totally let go of the idea.  I just have soooo many other things to think about.           In fact, mandie, I've been thinking about how cool it would be to write a book or a story about Jeneatte(the old lady that my mom helps)~i'm about 99% sure that it will never happen, but it would be awesome if I did.  That lady has had to live through CRAZY things so I think it would be cool to write about it.  Kind of like a child called "it" type of thing mixed with "Radio" because of her mental disabilities.  She was abused as a child and so was her husband.  Also, I laid in bed and thought about the cover~actually this is what brought on the idea of doing the book.  Well, I would LOVE to draw her face.  Take her picture and then go and put it on the computer and turn up the contrast a lot and print it out in black and white and then use that to draw it out in ebony.  She has the most wrinkly face I think that I've ever seen.  Then I kind of played with the idea of drawing her old face on one side, and her young face on the other side for the cover.  Hmmmmmmm.  You would probably be able to do a really good drawing of her.  The only thing with the story is that I would want to record conversations with her so that I could use them later and really get a lot of details from her view.  The only thing is that I am sure that a lot of the topics might be hard for her to talk about and I don't want to dredge up bad memories.  This is the weird things that I think about while lying in bed.  Actually it is just during the summer that I get weird ideas before falling asleep.  During the winter i'm too tired to think.  Oops!  Forgot about the paragraphs again!;)  I'll go fix that.          Well I should go to bed.  Yawn.  Oh I have also decided that when I grow up, if I have an inside dog, I do not care how ugly it looks, it is going to be one of those dogs without hair.  You guys know how little my dog is, and just the little amount that she sheds is driving me CRAZY!  I think that I am going to come up with a little plastic suit for her just like a shower cap type thing so that all of her shedding stays in that.  It's really annoying because the other day I was in a black shirt and I laid down on the couch and got little white hairs all over me.          Oh today I got set up to paint on one of my favorite verses on my wall.  To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.  I think that it is in eccl.  I find that verse very comforting, it sounds better than saying that you are going through a phase;).  The only thing is, figuring out which "season" you're in and enjoying your time through that season.  Well, I could easily go on my soapbox now and talk about seasons pertaining to life and blah blah blah, but I won't because this post is already pretty long and not really filled with anything useful(that's what happens when you write posts when you are on drugs~allergy meds that is;)).  Well, good night and farewell for now.

      So, I have finally applied to a college!  This will be the second college I have applied to, but I have it done nonetheless.  I applied to PCC first, and was accepted.  But I don't want to go there.  I applied to Grace today, and I'm not crazy about going there.  Only if it's the Lord's will, and it quite possibly could be, will I go there.  It feels so good to have that done!  Now all I have to do is wait to get my edited essay back from my neighbor Becky Dingeldein, (funny name, huh?) then I will apply to Taylor University.  I'm hoping to go there, but it's all in the Lord's hands.  (and boy, am I glad of that!!!)  I was reading in my Bible Study today, and something struck me as fasinating, so I thought I'd share it with you...  "Let not your heart be troubled."  The very mention of "Let not..." should be an indicator that this is a command, not a suggestion.  Oftentimes I allow so many things to bother me and destroy my thinking.  I will get down, and perhaps bring others with me!  "Let not your heart be troubled" means bringing your problems to the Lord, not daily, but constantly!  Satan enjoys getting me down by troubing my thoughts.  These bothersome woes obstruct my good intentions, and bring me to a crashing fall before I even knew I was tripping!  Even by itself, that simple phrase brings peace to my wearied mind.  I think from now on, (these are my "good intentions" talking)  I plan to remind myself to not let my heart be troubled.  Especially at work when I stress out easily.  Either that or take vicadin.  Wow, that would make work fun... hehe.    Nah, I won't go that route!  Looking to Jesus is always better!  Tomorrow I plan to go to my grandma Penrod's house and do some encouraging over there.  I haven't been able to spend time with her in a while, and I just love talking to her.  I have such respect for the women in my family, all of them.  Well, I hope you all are haveing a wonderful day, as I am!  Keep looking to Jesus, and don't forget to talk to Him too! He want's to hear from you!  Just Because He Lives! Mandie  P.S. Hey Laura, that book you let me borrow is very good!

      So, this wednesday my dad, Mandie and I traveled to the country of  Chicago.  We did so in our vehicle of choice, which was our family  Chrysler Intrepid.  We left at around 7:10 am.   Why, you ask?  Well, you see, I have an aunt Melody and my dad has  a sister Melody.  This Melody, being the same person, lives in San  Diego.  This Melody visits Indianaland every summer.  This  summer is no exception.  Therefore, this wednesday, she headed on  American Airlines towards the sprawling airport of O'Hare in the  sprawling city of Chicago!   One might assume Melody might just  walk  to Warsaw from Chicago.  But no!  No, my dear friend, it was our intention to drive to "pick her up."   And so we did.   However, her airplane was not scheduled to arrive at O'Hare until  12:30.  7-ish + 3hrs = 10-ish.  This gave us around 2 hours  to do the most exciting thing possible:  go to Chinatown!     click on any image for a larger version     urlLink    Here Mandie and I stand in the streets of Chinatown.      urlLink     Here is a shot of the entrance to Chinatown, cleverly decorated in a traditional Chinese fashion.     urlLink     Mandie looks at me enthusiastically while I smile.  But nevermind  us, look at the guy on the curb behind us.  I wonder what he  thinks about those people behind him and all that  stuff.   Chinese people must love stuff.     urlLink     Look, they have stores!     urlLink    Mandie wants to buy chopsticks.     urlLink     Local Christian church.     urlLink     Some not-so-Chinese-but-probable-still-made-in-China things.    urlLink     This store is full of ginseng, and other roots and whatnot.  It costs a lot.  Hundreds of dollars for a pound of  root .  Doesn't Mandie appear puzzled?       urlLink     Look at the little old Chinese lady,  she  must understand...     urlLink     Look, Mandie can't read Chinese!     urlLink     We quickly escaped the store of confusion, and luckily found some crabs.  Everybody loves crabs.     urlLink     She's so happy with her crabs.     urlLink     Oh boy!  Weird Chinese treats in a bag!     urlLink     Some American cars clutter the curbs of Chinatown.     urlLink     This might just seem to be a bathroom. Well, it is. But it's a bathroom  of a special place. The sandwich place. The place where they take  roll-like things, and put different things in them. My favorite is the  hotdog. Also, there are many chinese men speaking in foreign tongues  and smoking in this bakery of sorts.     urlLink     Suddenly, Mandie and my dad are going the wrong way on a moving walkway at the airport!     urlLink     I'm too scared to do so, so I watch from the outside.     urlLink     Oh look, it's Mandie and Bob coming up the escalator!  We like the  many escalators, moving walkways, and elevators of the airport.   They're fun.     urlLink     However, we couldn't play on said people-moving devices for long.   Why?  Melody!  We were all very excited to see Melody.   She is quite the cool aunt.  Mandie looks important.   The trip home consisted of not feeling so well because of talk shows,  hispanic music, and much talking on the parts of my dad and aunt.   Therefore, there are no pictures.    I hope you enjoyed my illustrated story of "The Journey to Chicago!"   Come back sometime for something else, or something.   rla

      Last night the Lord would not let me rest until I had written the words that were in my head.  So, groggy, I sat up in bed and turned on the light.  After fumbeling around for a pencil and notebook paper I wrote:  Remember Jesus, Beloved.  When earth's long whiles are filled with scorn, And loss of loved ones leave you torn; When hope is vanquished and you stand forelorn- Remember Jesus, Beloved. Remember Jesus.  When passionate rage and pain stand still, And all you have left is shattered will; When you see those sins you saught to kill- Remember Jesus, Beloved. Remember Jesus.  As you're hanging upon your cross You've built yourself-YOU count the cost;  And when you're sure all hope is lost... Remember Jesus, Beloved. Remember Jesus.  "Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabachthani?!" That morunful night through tears He cried So He could stand now, by your side! Remember Jesus, Beloved. Remember Jesus.  I believe He sent me those words for a purpose... and not strictly mine.  I pray those words touched you with the same magnititude that they did me.  You see, "Remember Jesus, Beloved. Remember Jesus!" were the words that Peter cried to his dear wife as she was being crucified by Roman soldiers.  He did not scream words of pain, or tears---nor make fleating attempts to have her rebuke Christ.  His example to me is profound, and I pray that someday I too may have a testimony like that.  For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  For the glory of God eternal.  Robert, I appreciate your last entry about free will.  So often we try to lay blame on God for our own failings, and even perhaps present situations.  Blessed are those who live with so little, yet have the capacity to praise God with what they have.  I pray that the Lord will teach me to bless Him sufficieintly in my present circumstances.  It's late, and I have many things to look at yet.  I want you, my friends, to know how much I am praying for you, and care for you deeply.   Keep looking to Jesus! In His service, Mandie Marie

       Tell you where you need to go Tell you when you need to leave Tell you what you need to know Tell you who you need to be  Everything inside you know there's more than what you heard So much more than empty conversation filled with empty words  And you're on fire when He's near you You're on fire when He speaks You're on fire, burning at these mysteries  Give me one more time around Give me one more chance to see Give me everything You are Give me one more chance to be  Everything inside me looks like everything I hate You are the hope I have for change, You are the only chance I'll take  When I'm on fire when You're near me I'm on fire when You speak I'm on fire burning at these mysteries These mysteries  I've been standing on the edge of me standing on the edge of me standing on the edge of me standing on the edge of me standing on the edge of everything I've never been before And I've been standing on the edge of me standing on the edge  And I'm on fire when You're near me I'm on fire when You speak I'm on fire burning at these mysteries   I wish I could write songs like Switchfoot can.  Anyway, onto some ramblings.  Is God still an all-powerful God even through very hard times?  Time and time again I've heard people say that it's impossible for them to grow closer to God, because whenever they do, He keeps pushing them away.  Whenever they feel that they are really starting to grow closer to Christ, it seems to them that something in their life happens that isn't exactly easy to deal with.  But does this really mean that God is out to get us, to put us through hard times just to see us squirm?  Of course not!  God is love.  People die.  If they didn't, they wouldn't be human.  People sin, doing horrible things to themselves and others.  If they couldn't, they wouldn't have free will!    Because of this free will, we are free to do one of two things.  Do things for God, or do things for someone else.  We can either choose to turn to Him, or we can turn to the world.  We can set out to become perfect in the world's eyes, or we can set out to become perfect in God's eyes.    In doing the former, for a very long time we very likely will feel a very great amount of self worth.  We might feel like we've really made it in this world.  But then it comes tumbling down and the wages of our sin come raining down on us.  What kind of standard is the world?  The only constant thing in this world, as far as I can see, is sin.  Throughout history, that's the only thing that I can see is constant.  Humans have always had sin.  They always will, as long as they have free will.  But it doesn't have to be that way.  Instead of trying to live up to the standards of the sinful world, we can try to live up to the constant that's been here throughout time,  outside  of time.  The only thing He wants for us is to give everything up to Him.  This is the simplest thing I can thing of for Him to ask us to do.  No matter what we encounter in life, all He wants us to do is to turn to Him.    However, as we're so stuck on trying to live up to the world's standards of what we need to feel happy, we don't always want to let go of some things.  If following God means we have to give up our tv, then we want no part in it.  Why do we say we want to follow Him, but when He tells us to rid ourselves of certain things,  that  is where we draw the line.   That  is where God has gone just too far.  However, what we fail to realize is that by getting rid of those things that we think we just can't live without, and following His will, things that we could have never imagined happen.  The happiest moments of my life have been, without a doubt, when I have been serving Him completely.  The scary thing about that is, though, is that we never know what's next.  Can't we just get it into our brains that it doesn't matter what's next, because no matter what it will be right?  I know that's my main struggle in life.  I've seen too much how low my wants and desires bring me.  I've known depths that I wish I could say nobody else could comprehend.  I've been so lost in sin that I didn't even have sight of God.  But I also know what the other extremity can be like.  I want to see more how high God's will in my life can take me in this life.  I want to be on fire for Christ, and Christ only.  rla

      I suppose it's my turn to write a blog.  I haven't done it in so very long.  I tell you, sometimes being angry is so stupid.  I should give my mom a copy of "Mere Christianity," it would do her a world of good.  You see, she and I have been trying for so long to retrieve a gift certificate off of Amazon.com and it just won't work!  So mom has to get all angry with Grandma McD. and Grandma McD. has to get all angry with mom.  (more stupid complex details to my story that I just don't want tell you because they are so very stupid.)  Anyway, mom has to call up grandma and explain in a loud tone all the injustices done to her... and then grandma must do the same.  Then mom must hang up on her and stomp around the house slamming doors and scream at me because of the acute injustices done to her.   Mandie tries to explain to mom that it really isn't a big deal and that Christians should not act like that to others, even when others do them wrong.  Mandie fails miserably.  So now Mandie is lying very low and playing invisible.  So far it is working.  On to happier times.  Bob, those pictures of Walter kitty are so very cute.  I think you should stick with the name Walter.  I mean really, if somebody asked you what the names of your pets were you could proudly say "Walter and Sheryl!"  I mean really Bob, isn't that so very cute?  Or you cold just name it "Coco Wheat" to go along with "Cream of Wheat" that you named your last cat.  Say Laura,  we need to go play tennis soon.  I am in desperate need of some fun exercise.  Perhaps we can do that this week.  Bob said that I may relate to you what we did this past week, but frankly I don't remeber a thing... except for the fact that I was overly emotional.  I will leave it up to the guy to remember the facts.   When a female is asked to recall what she actually DID during times of acute emotional stress, I can conclusivly say that she will most likely not remember.  Well, I must be going now.  I am going to study some Russian before I go to work... isn't that fascinating?  God be with you all. Because He lives, Amanda Marie

      Here, my friends, is the cute kitten.  urlLink    Isn't he cute?  urlLink    Mandie and I like the cute kitten.  urlLink    I'm probably even a little too excited about the kitten.  urlLink    We're so happy with the kitten.  urlLink     Click on any picture for a larger version of it.   Now that you've been awed (probably quite literally) by the cuteness of the kitten, here's some background.   urlLink    This is "the farm."  It's official title is "Treehouse Farm," but I usually just call it the farm.  The details of the farm, I'll perhaps go into later.  On friday my dad went out to the farm to burn some stuff.  Apparently he didn't just burn some stuff.  Friday night he came home not only with pizza, but also with this very adorable kitten.  Mandie says we should name him Walter, but we're still working on it.  Anyway, the plan is to keep "Walter" until he's old enough to survive on his own at the farm, and then to take him back out.  At least that's my mom's plan.  My secret plan is to somehow in the next couple months coax my mom into thinking that we simply must keep the poor little kitten!  I mean, really, the kitten's probably going to just run away at the farm.  Then, who knows what will happen!  Isn't that sad?  Isn't there some kind of petition I can make?    Anyway, that's the most exciting I think that has gone on lately.  Perhaps Mandie, if she gets the chance can fill you in on some more of the details.  If not, perhaps I'll just try getting into the habit of actually posting more stuff.  Even though I do believe there is NOBODY reading anything I put on here apart from me, Mandie, and Laura.  Nope, probably not.  Anyway, Rod's here for the night, and I must go throw things at him.  rla

      Well, I sorta asked him to.  Anyhoo, yeah, I locked my keys in my car.  And, of course, the spare in my pocket didn't work, and of course, my brother lost the original in a massive pile of wood and whatnot.  So, I got to have a cop come and break into my car!  It was really quite interesting.  He didn't accept the Dr. Pepper I offered him.  Is that rude, or just overprotective?  Or maybe he's just healthy?  Either way, whatever.    Parking cars for the fair has been interesting.  Had a good amount yesterday, but not so much today.  Is changing the price from $1 to $2 really THAT scary?  If the demolition derby doesn't bring in more tomorrow, I'm gonna have to... yell at a wall or something.  Either way, Mandie looks  really  cute holding a "park here" sign.  Off to sleep!  rla

      Hello everyone again!&nbsp; I realized that I had not been keeping up my end of this blog very well so I should write something.&nbsp; Also right now I should be washing dishes, and I thought that this would be more fun:).&nbsp; Well, I have been very busy lately with the cabinets.&nbsp; I think after I get off of here I am going to start to prime the frames, if they are dry~we washed them down with TSP.&nbsp; Also, I have a couple of cabinet doors to prime as well.&nbsp; I'm a little bit irritated with my parents because they are like moving a mule~not very easy.&nbsp; We need to be buying the new cabinets for the new section of our kitchen but I can tell that mom is not ready to do that yet, but that is what we should be doing.&nbsp; We need to get the&nbsp; new cabinets installed and then pick out counter top and have that installed then call a plumber to plumb in the new sink and to put a new part on our old sink and then call an electrician to do all of the can lights.&nbsp; At this rate it will be a long time from now when we get to that point, but oh well.&nbsp;  But I do have good news.&nbsp; Nika's(my gymnastics coach/boss~since I teach classes for her) daughter had a baby and so she was gone on the first day of the new session of gymnastics classes and so one of the people that judge gymnastics had to teach in place of Nika.&nbsp; She had no idea what to do and I helped her~even though she was supposed to be the main one in charge.&nbsp; She left rave reviews with my boss and told her to give me a raise at which my boss said that she had just given me a raise and so I will be getting my raise in the fall.&nbsp; The money part is nice, but the compliment is nicer since I hope to go into teaching someday.&nbsp; Well, I had better go work on the cabinets. As always, ~Laura

      Today was a pretty cool day.  If I could have more days like today, I'd be a pretty happy camper.  I went to work, which went pretty smoothly. I got off an hour early too... that was very nice.  After work I went to the library and dropped off some books. The librarian lady fixed some of their mistakes for charging me and I save a whole dollar! That was happy.  At the library I picked up some books that will be fascinating to look at.  One book is called "City of God" by St. Augistine.  Another is the Quaran, and I supplemented it with "Islam in Focus."  I figure if I am going to adamantly oppose this religion I need to know more about it and how I can justly disprove it.  Although through this time, I must intensify my bible reading.  I need to fight fire with fire.  After that, I came home and did a bit of reading in Mere christianity.  (good book, highly advised) and did some Econ. (wow, fun stuff)  Then I left to go to Plymoth to see Christina, my boyfriends sister... which is kid of odd, but it was fun!  She gave me some plants to put in my aquarium with my new beta, Napoleon.  We chatted a lot, and I got to drink some wonderful Jasmine tea from China, which was (as corney as it sounds) simply divine! I have to get a bit more comfortable with her yet, but I think we will become good friends in years to come.  We have a LOT in common.  Well, driving out to Plymoth was the wonderful little bout of independance I needed today.  It's kinda peaceful driving home by yourself.  Going somewhere you've never gone alone.  I don't know, I don't get out much and I'm easily ammused. :)    I had a pretty good day! I hope you did too!  As for now, I must leave you.  Have a wonderful evening and may the Lord bless you!
