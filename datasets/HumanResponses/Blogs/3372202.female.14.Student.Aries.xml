      School is finally out and i am bored out of my mind. what is up? it is summer and i cant think of anything to do! all i have been doing all day is downloading music on the internet. some AC/DC some Kiss some White Snake, you know, all that great stuff. i was gonna spend the night at ariels but she has to go somewhere early tomorrow morning. i dont feel like getting up early so i am going tomorrow. anyway, im listening to "Pour Some Sugar on Me" by Def Leppard. can anyone guess my favorite song? haha, i bet not. try and if nobody can guess than i guess i will tell you later. i wanna go somewhere before i start summer school. like splashtown or astro world or the mall for some of that bourbon chicken at the famous cajun and grill. haha, yeah, i could really use some of that right now. well this is gonna be a really long blog entry, so if you are reading it you will get bored quick. i have this cool cup and it has a clown on it. it always reminds me of the insane clown posse. is that wierd? hmmm. anyway, im starting to get along with jack some but i still hate him with a passion. we better not be keeping him. the other day my little sister lauren started to cry because she saw scratches on his chest where Momma Kat tried to get away. it was sad. he is evil and i dont want him living in my house. the only reason we got him was because we had this other boxer that was really sweet. he was a stray, and we didnt know, but he had heartworms, and they killed him. it was really sad. i have some neighbors who hate dogs and we are guessing that they poisoned like six of our other dogs, because they died mysteriously. well anyway, enough about the animals. does anyone know about the disney movie "oliver and company"? i always cry during the part in the beginning. it is sad. yeah... change of subject.. oh! my mom is getting a new job. today was her last day! im so happy because she hated that old job. i have to get braces. that sucks. i have to wear them for four years, too. booooooooo! from everyone who has had them, they have said that braces suck. oh well, at least i didnt have to wear them for five years like my sister. hahah! that cracks me up. has anyone heard of the Electric Prunes? look them up if you have never heard of them. well im gonna go bike riding and work off those calories that i had for breakfast. i had waffles drenched in syrup. haha. oh well. i will be back on msn later for anyone who wants to talk. dont call because i wont be here. well see ya!  ---sara

      We just got this dog like a month ago, and his name is jack and i hate him.  he killed my cat of 14 years, since i was born, the deaf and blind one. i dont really know what happened, i was just told that he killed her and i saw her dead in a box. she had blood all over her neck. i hate that damn dog. he has no guilt, or mercy for killing hjer either. i came in the door and he came up and was wagging his tail and acting like a dumbass and licking me. i was like get off me. he doesnt come near me and if he does i yell at him. i just need some time to learn and forgive him. it will take weeks, maybe monthes. right now i cant even look at him. well yesterday we found this bird i our backyard and it was a baby and it fell from the nest. chris is supposed to come over and see it but i dont know right now. dammit i hate that dog. im sorry guys, you just have to know where im coming from. i have had that cat around for 14 years, since before i was born, she was actually 15 but i only knew her for 14... anyway, im going to go run and think about things... see ya later if you are on msn... whatever. im gonna go. by the way, dont listen to my gay sister if she posts on my blog, shes never around to even know me...thanks for listening...  ---sara

      I was supposed to go to the movies with some friends this friday (today) but afterschool we went to chick-fil-a to get something to eat, and an hour later i called my mom.  she was like you should have called me sooner, and i was like well i had my cell phone on and you could have called me, and she was like well you are grounded.  so now i cant go. i hate being grounded. it freakin sucks and i cant do anything. i cant go outside or up to nikki's house or anything. gaby i hope you aren't mad at me, i really wanted to go with you to see the movie but i cant.  im sorry. abby and nikki might go instead, but i don't know. anyway, parents suck. i hate it when you make plans and they say it's okay and then they ground you.  she was starting this sucky lecture about how " could have called her and all could have been prevented."  isnt that gay? i hate it that i cant just do what i want and then when i feel like it then i can call her. whatever. it is gay. ewww my dog just slimed me!!! that is friggen gross. he is one of those dogs who just does that. boxers...geez. anyway, nobody ever comes to these gay blogs so i dont even know why i have one and i actually write stuff. i only know like 4 people who would actually come to my blog, and even they dont have a reason. i am so glad... only 4 days of school left, even though i have summer school... algebra sucks.  if i want to do this thing for the freakin academy then i have to take algebra.  i hope i pass. haha it would suck to take it and then flunk, because it costs like 175 bucks. who in their right mind (besides me) would pay that? well im gonna go bike 4 miles. see ya later.  ---sara

      damn, i hate reality tv. me and nikki watched the freakin bachelor for the whole time and he picked the one chick we didnt want him to pick. that freakin sucks. anyway, i am so relieved that school is almost out but i have to go to summer school. im gonna fail the history exam, the science exam, and well thats really it. im too lazy to study. haha. anyway, i hate all this gay drama about ditching and friends and all that crap. i would rather just not have friends and be antisocial, but then that would suck because i was antisocial not too long ago and you get lonley. well i used to be antisocial, believe it or not. i hated meeting new people and making new friends, but now im good. you know what i hate?  conceited people. i cant stand them. they are so full of themselves and always care if they look perfect or if their lipgloss doesnt look sticky. isnt that gay? this girl i didnt even know came up to me and asked me if her lipgloss looked sticky.  what are you supposed to say? i said "your dumb" and walked away. im so freakin bored. it is like 12:07 am and i have to go to sleep but im not tired. i will be tomorrow though. i made a 20 on that quiz of holly's.  so sorry. i hate being put on the spot. well im gonna try to sleep. see ya later.  ---sara

      Hey whats up all?  I am having a great day, week rather, knowing that school is almost out!  Then i will have the summer off until i have to go to summer school... Anyways, does anyone out there love family guy?  It is the best show in the world! i love it and if you dont love it or you havnt seen it watch adult swim at ten thirty PM on mondays- thursdays. everyone loves it. but yeah, just in case, Viewer's Discretion Advised! it is hilarious and fun and if your parents wont let you watch it then they suck!  Hey i might go to the beach this weekend, and if not then the weekend after next.  I like this blog thing. i had never heard of it before jamie introduced me to it like sometime this week.  ha ha i have posted once everyday. like she told me monday about it and right away i signed up.  okay enough about that... does anyone have anything interesting to share? i hate thinking up things on the spot. how do you feel about the war and all?  i think we should pull out... it's like another Nazi- Jew situation only we are the Nazis.  We are torturing their people.  Well we arent but some of the soldiers are... i see it on the news all the time! about how Iraq is being not only rebuilt, but terrorized by us.  i feel bad and bush sucks for that even though it isnt his fault... i like bush but the way things are going he doesnt stand a chance at reelection time.  i say that Chaney should have been the president! ha ha just kidding. bush is handling things okay but it could have been better.  my mom has this eerie habit of reading over my shoulder. sorry to change the subject so soon and stuff but it is annoying.  anyway, that is my opinion of it all.  send in some of your opinions too so i can see things from different points of view.

      Hey Everyone! What's up? Today was an okay day... We only have less than two weeks until the summer!! Anyway, I was tired all day. I made a 98 on my history test... you know, the one that you have to know all of the states and capitols, the great lakes, the major rivers, the oceans, and the surrounding countries. Yeah so i was excited. I am currently in a fight with someone and i will let them remain nameless- but if you have time you can listen to the whole story. We were riding our bikes and we decided to do this thing where we go really fast. So we did, and she (the person who is nameless) wanted to do it again. Anyway, i told her i didn't want to because my legs were all rubbery because they hadn't been exercised like that in a long time. She went off on me and she was like (ACTUAL QUOTE) "well just because you are lazy and out of shape..." (UNQUOTE) I was like (ACTUAL QUOTE) "excuse me?" (UNQUOTE)and i sped up and went ahead of her and when i got home i waited for her to come up the street so she could hear me slam the door. it sucked because now i am stuck hanging out with the neighborhood kids again... great... anyway, just thought i would post my bad day, along with the other eighty of them. comment on what you think i should do... should i apologize to her... talk to her and make her apologize... take a break from the friendship... you know whatever, it doesn't matter, just give me some feedback.  ---Sara

      Hey Everybody whats up?  I had a great weekend... not really.  I was ditched by two people!! well really only one because i forgave one of the persons.  for their own reasurrance, i will call them Billy and Bob. So... We, meaning Billy, Bob, and me, were having a great friday and we were all hanging out and talking about how we would have a great weekend.  So that night, i had to go out to eat with my family for a birthday, so they said we would hang on Sunday.  i wake up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to spend the day with Billy and Bob, and so i go down to Billy's house, and she isn't there!  turns out she had to go shopping with her mom and Grandma... and so i decided to go to Bob's house.  when i got there, i found out from a neighbor that Bob was at the beach with her mom and aunt. So i was stuck with the lame neighborhood kids down the street.  How great. i should have called someone else who was also ditched. we could have hung out.  well got to go study for a history exam for tomorrow!  thanks for listening to my boring sob story!  ---Sara

      About two or three monthes ago, me and nikki went to walmart to buy some fish. when we got there, there were like 80, more or less, of betta fish that were near death, and many already dead. so we started this thing and i bought two of the fish and she bought one. after two weeks we found out that mine were already too far gone to live and they died. nikki's, although, was able to be saved. so to this day it is still alive and kicking. anyway, we went back to the same walmart and me and nikki each bought three betta fish each. if you would like to get involved with us and our "Saving of the Bettas," simply go and buy a four dollar betta and a three dollar tank. remember, not only are you saving the fish, but you are making their lives more tolerable. okay, anyway, just thought i would share. well im gonna go to sleep, and please make the right decision and purchase a beautiful betta from walmart. REMEMBER: if you do purchase more than one, do not place them in the same tank. it is for their safety. thanks for your support!  ---sara

      our power was out for like the longest time and i was entirely bored because all of the things i could do had to do with electricity. unless i wanted to go outside and get caught in a huge flood or get struck by lightening. so, i curled up in the huge automan chair next to our bay windows and was reading a book. it is a good book called "the world that crumbled." it is a book about the Holocaust. so far so good. my sis brought it back from D.C. along with two other Holocaust books. they are really fascinating and interesting. well im on page 109 and i have to go read more... because it is one of those books you just cant put down... got to go!  ---sara

      hey everyone! im bored and i have nothing to do. well actually i should be doing my algebra homework but im not because it is too boring. i am hungry too. the only person who is on msn is tre but talking to him online is like talking to a brick wall... no offence, tre. summer school isnt that bad, because kari is there, and dhelynn is there too, so its okay. i just hate the work. we are doing the graphing shit and it is so boring. the teacher, mrs parton isnt that bad. she doesnt notice anything so we get away with everything. haha most of the time anyway. my dogs need to be bathed. they smell. oh- today we, as in me abby and nikki, were on the trampoline and we were jumping in the rain and it was fun. but then, all of a sudden it stopped raining and we were bored so we made up a "rain dance." we said that nikki needed to be the "sacrifice," and i was like " okay abby you hold her down, and i will slit her throat!" we were only kidding... but nikki said "NO! No! Wait! cant i just pick and old scab or something?" it was hilarious. you had to be there. so im going to go bike two miles. i will see ya later! maybe...  ---sara
