      What is the truth? What is the meaning of life? Deep questions hor? These are some of the questions my zealous christian friend asked me. His perspective is that there are some standard answer in the Holy Bible, but my stand, being a 'faithful but not devoted' Catholic, is that some times bible do not answer all the questions in life. My way of thinking is more of a free thinker than a Catholic as what I firmly believe is that all religions are good in one way or another.  All religions teach their believers how to be good and act in an orderly manner. They all promote good values, which I believe is fundamental to the entire human civilisation. The sad thing is that some people use religions for their own good and interpret the meaning of the teachings in a totally different way. The muslim terrorists that are so active lately is a very good example. Islam is a very old religion that has its roots all the way back to who-knows-when. And I believe that Islam teaching teaches muslims to be good and benevolent towards fellow men, not ram planes into buildings loh. Many people tink that Islam is a bad religion that produces terrorist but i tend to tink in the way that those terrorists are also victims of the actual terrorist (think Osama) that pretends to be a religious leaders. Many of the followers of Bin Laden actually believe that they are serving Allah by committing terrorist acts, but little do they know that they are in fact going against their beloved god.  Hahaha by now you are very confused by what is the point that I am driving at right? From the 'What is the meaning of Life?' question to terrorism. I answer you now, there is no point! hahaha If there is an answer to both of the chim chim questions, then the person who give u the answer must be super duper enlightened, or seriously deluded ah. So next time someone ask you 'What is the Truth?' you better answer 'there is no Truth lah, stop dreaming lah!', and another guy ask u,'What is the meaning of Life?', den u better answer,' U got nothing better to do ah! Keep on asking this type of bo liao question? u no life leh!'  With this, I end my ah gong jiang gu session liao. Kinda stressed out by my projects so start to write crap liao.. wahahahaha

      Balancing. Who really is able to perform this delicate act perfectly? Tonight, I have been slapped with the fault of not being able to perform this act perfectly. This made me think, which one is more important? Friends, family or your partner? Each and every one of them adds a different value to the complex formula of each of our short lives. How do we actually measure the importance of each entity?  Do we have to sacrifice some of them to gain another? Why can't we just be able to have all of them at the same time in harmony?  These are just some of the questions circulating in my head after the encounter. My feeling now is undescribable now, a mixture of helpless and confusion, as at this point of time, I might have to sacrifice one of the entity to retain another. And I really do not want to do so, and when the time comes for me to make a choice, the decision that I make will definitely break my heart, whatever the decision is.  HAHAHAHA! How? Do I sound pessimistic enough? HAHAHA.. Life is short, time is short and the key to making full use of both life and time is to manage your time! Apparently, my time management skills are like sh*t! So to all of the readers out there, manage your time properly and you can skip the first two paragraphs liao. wahahaha (Wah! almost 2 liao ah... typing in the dark sumore... haiz  ;P)

      Wow... its my 3rd day writing blog neh! this must be a miracle! hahahaha.. actually not bad lah.. quite refreshing to write daily lah.. lets just see how long i can keep this up.  Hmmm let me see... wat did i do today.. sleep until 11 then wake up, go haf lunch with carol, go home, go out to haf coffee with adrian they all, had dinner outside, den go back home again.. wow.. wat an eventful day! *sarcastic remark* kekeke..  with so many of my closer friends getting attached (or hoping to get attached), it makes me wonder... Single life better or attached life? Freedom vs Committment? I guess there are loads of arguement for both sides but at the end of the day which one is better? people say that grass is always greener on the other side, or the stolen fruit is always the sweetest, but I say that appreciate what you possess (unless you possess poison fruits).  Hmmm... getting long winded.. is it one of the symptoms of senility? Am I getting old? Of course not! hahaha good night to you~

      A great man once said, most great achievements in life usually have humble beginnings... So look at the first post, humble enough anot? ;P  Okay, this post is my official start of my blog and hopefully and can maintain enough drive and motivation to carry on updating it. The first week of my final year in NTU has just passed, sounds kinda ironic hor.. After 3 years of slacking in NTU, I have finally made up my mind to get my act together! but come to think of it, i have been saying the same ting over n over again.. haiz... Then again, its my character lah. hahaha..  This year will be a memorial year for me as it will be my last year of schooling (hopefully) and after this, it will be work work and more work. I guess i will stop my first entry here bah, after all i promised a humble beginning mah.. so cya soon (hopefully again)
