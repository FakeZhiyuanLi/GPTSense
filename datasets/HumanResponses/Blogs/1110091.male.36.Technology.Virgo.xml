      I managed to scrape up some money yesterday and purchased  Sleuth  from Larry (of Face2Face Games).  I think the artwork and quality of the game are super, although the linen of the cards are a bit too textured for my liking.  If you hold them a certain way, the light will glare off of the card and make it difficult to read the card.  This is such an improvement over the old 3M version of the game which had almost no artwork to speak of.  I think this is one of the things that I like best about Face2Face; they take the time and extra effort (read money) into making an already good game that much better.  I'm sure that  Sleuth  would have sold well if it was just a reprint of the 1967 3M game.  The attention to detail and improvement on presentation should make this a hit.  The family took the new version out for a 'spin' this afternoon and had a pretty good time.  The game is a bit much for Julia (age 6) but she's understanding some of the ideas.  She insists playing, though, so three-cheers for her tenacity!  I also finished reading Dean Koontz's latest "  The Taken  ".  I'll give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  If it wasn't for the ending, which tied the story up nicely, I'd have rated a one.  To me, this just didn't stand up to the enjoyment, that I've come to expect, from a Dean Koontz book.  I'm usually struck by the characters in one of his yarns.  There's always at least one character that I'm drawn to, and whom I'm interested in following.    The Taken   just doesn't have the 3D characterization that I'm used to.  Granted the tale takes place for the most part over a time span of less than a day, and the action is roller-coaster paced.  So, what can I expect?  I guess I was just hoping for more.  Perhaps a longer novel would have sated my appetite.  I'm now on to read Stephen King's   Dreamcatcher  .  Looks like alien conquest stories are filling some need.  :)

      It's been quite a busy couple of days.  Work has had me zooming between Providence, RI and Newport three times so far.  Luckily the day is almost over so I'm kind of coasting into the weekend.  Had rehearsal over at the Mason's lodge on Wednesday and had a great time.  I really enjoy being with the guys and learning the protocols of opening and closing the lodge is very interesting.  I'm learning that my ability to do an 'about-face' is lacking.  Note to self... Don't wear rubber-soled shoes on meeting nights.  They have the propensity to grip the carpet when doing an about-face which I'm sure will eventually send me spilling to my keester in front of everyone.  Funny thing with all of this is that I was asked to be Senior Steward, instead of Junior Steward.  Honestly, I didn't really know what each office did, but I'm finding out that the Senior Steward, among other things, takes care of the kitchen and the meals for the lodge.  I'm kind of looking forward to do that, although I'm quite sure that it is going to take up a goodly chunk of time.  Lori, though, is quite supportive so it doesn't look like it is going to be any hardship.  I've also been spending my lunches with Larry at the Game Keeper.  It's usually always quite interesting visiting him and seeing the folks that wondering into the store.  Sid Sackson's  Sleuth  is now for sale.  I'd really like to get it, but we're a bit short on funds at the moment.  I'm going to call Lori to see if we can scrape up enough so we can get it for the weekend.  It would be fun to play while at the park with the kids.  I'm also hoping I can get a picnic setup in the next few weeks to have some friends over to the park and either play lawn type games or board games.  More later.

      I decided to start this blog up again.  Why?  Well I guess Im enjoying reading about what other people are doing and I'm finding that I dont spend nearly enough time reflecting about what Im doing / or have done.  Hopefully this will slow things down a bit and allow me to look back and say "Wow, I guess I really did do something last week!"  This evening was spent pretty much investigating (still a lot more to go) what a successful blog looks like.   urlLink Rebeccas Pocket  looks like a really good one.  I'm still kind of lost on what to write about.  My day as a Computer Network Analyst isn't really worth sharing.  Basically I drive from one place to the next fixing computer hardware, software, and network problems for doctors.  I guess the most important thing that I've learned from working on a job like this is to always keep an even keel, even when the client is flipping out, and also to keep the ol' ego in check; realizing that I don't know everything about computers and that each day is a learning experience.  I'm toying with the idea of setting up 2 blogs.  One (this one) to focus on the things that I enjoy, and the second to focus on health issues.    I'm the kind of guy who has many interests, but I have this character fault in that I seem to spend more time reading about my hobbies and interests more than I actually participate in them.  There's got to be a label for this kind of behavior, but the name escapes me.  (If you happen to know what it is, please let me know.)
