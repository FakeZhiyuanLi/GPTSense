      This blog comes out of a long held desire not to simply consume.  Society, it seems, wants to mould us into passive receivers taking whatever is fed to us and paying the price.  Well I don't want to do that.  I want to contribute, I want to be engaged, I want to comment on what I see, read, hear and experience. To be a part of something, however small that part is.  Maybe thats naive or arrogant, I don't know but I guess I'll find out.    To start with here's a bit more info about me... I live in Sheffield with my wife of one year, Helen.  We've very recently moved house so our lives are currently filled with unpacked boxes and pots of paints.  Our previous place was a very small flat but now we've moved into a glorious two bedroom house.  Very nice.  As of Setember I will be training to teach history in Secondary Schools, an undertaking that I'm more than a little nervous about and which will no doubt be mentioned again over the next few months.  I am a leader in  urlLink Expression  a church for Students and people who are like them that is part of  urlLink St Thomas Church .  Both St Tom's and Expression overlap with  urlLink Tribal Generation , a very cool network of relationships that train and resource people like me.     The thing that really gets me going is working out just what it means to follow Jesus and be like him today.  For me that includes lots of different streams and thoughts about things such as emerging church, social action, alternative worship and mission (if any of those are new things to you sorry, I'll try and explain/de-jargonize in future).  I also have a wide range of cultural inputs, particularly of the musical kind.  My tastes are wide and varied but centre around all things down-beat, instrumental and jazzy.  More on all that later.    I've no idea if anyone will ever read this thing but will try and update at least once a week anyway.  As a taster here are some things I've written before  urlLink Chill - Some thoughts on the craze for "Chill Out" music  urlLink Using Music Creatively in Worship - Ideas I've nicked and adapted  urlLink The Way of the Cross - A meditation I wrote last easter.

      So, this is my exciting new blog, a chance to engage more in the culture I feed off.  I am a total beginner, so it should be an exciting first few steps.

      how do you start writing something like this?  I guess by just rambling on.  But does my story need any beginning or end?  Probably but it isn't going to get one for a while.  I am now about half way through a PGCE.  Its been a lot of hard work but also a lot of fun.  Teaching is great- although I seem to want them to like me just a little too much.  My second school placement is now three days old and is taking place in a school in Barnsley.  Its quite different from Matlock last term but looks set to be a lot of fun.  Trying to get my head round the fact that God is committed to me becoming a teacher and may want to teach me important stuff through the teaching experience and more shockingly use it for his kingdom.  Was dreaming a little bit the other day and got quite excited.  I mean what if the reason that there are loads of crispies going into teaching is not just because its one of the only occupations that has traditionally been accepted by the church but is rather a kingdom strategy.  Its fairly plain to all who care to look that education is facing a bit of a crisis at the moment, so what if those of us getting into it are actually part of something bigger than we suspect.  Its just a thought.  But its one of those things that gets my heart going.

      So that was a very long gap.  The thing about everything is that your good intentions and admirable desires get squashed by real life issues such as doing a PGCE and having lots of work, being a lazy toe-rag and being lent my brothers game cube.  But with the luxury of a little time, coupled with the fact that its too cold in my living room right now to go and play or watch TV and that I haven't the money to go to the pub (being a poor student) I shall re-contribute and get a little self indulgent.  I'll try and be a little better at it in the future.  Went to see City of God a while back.  A fantastic film with a lot to say about things like violence, gun culture and two thirds world things.  A good analysis of it can be found at  urlLink fish.co.uk   The film gave me a new understanding of living a full and vibrant life within a fallen world.  It celebrated excitement, growing up, love and life while at the same time forcing the viewer to come to terms with the grim realities of poverty and crime.  And the disco scene is one of the best pieces of film making I've seen in a long time.  Very Good.

      Bit of a rant coming up... apologies in advance...  Like everyone elso I've see the pictures of the guy seeking asylum whose gone on hunger strike and was made to feel quite sick by it.  What kind of a country are we to turn away people who are obviously so traumatised and desperate as he was.  The whole anti asylum seeker paranoia has really got me fuming right now.  Why are people, many of whome have very legitimate reasons for wanting to come to Britain, like torture we'll never know or poverty beyond our understanding, demonized not just by the media but (supposedly) by rational people.  What kind of a country are we?  It makes me ashamed, particularly as we have been spending billions on a war to get rid of weapons that may or may not have existed.  Sometimes it seems like everything is upside down.    But its so easy to leave it at that isn't it?  To say its all upside down but its not my fault.  How do we act, how do we make a difference?  There must be something more than shrugging and accepting the status quo.  I think there is,  over the Bank Holiday I went to Saltaire, a Victorian Village in Yorkshire.  This place had been built by a wealthy mill owner in the industrial revolution to get his workers out of the filthy conditions in industrials and into a community, once he'd built them decent houses, a church, a boating house and a village green he moved many people in.  Now the village was built along the lines of a Victorian Middle Class Man's rural ideal and I don't know how perfect he was but the story really got me.  Here was one man who did not accept that life was the way it was and that was the end of it.  He devoted himself to providing a better alternative.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.

      Listened to the new Blur album in a record shop today.  It's very very good!  The first track is a bit of an anthem with the lyrics:             " I aint got, nothing to be scared of, cos I love you"  over and over again, in the words of Neo, "Whoah".  Hooked to  urlLink The Ark  on  urlLink Ship of Fools .  It's a 40 day reality game-show where biblical characters live on Noah's Ark.  Very funny, but also a great re-imagining and re-telling of Bible stories.  Love it.

      I've got a job!  I had an interview yesterday and am very happy.  Before going to the School I was unsure about it, some people had put me off by the things they said.  But the kids and staff I met all seemed very positive about it and I loved the place.  All the other candidates were given jobs too so there'll be a bunch of us starting in the same boat.  Start in September.  So that's it settled.  I’ll absolutely definitely be a teacher.  Cool testimony/God story thing.  The night before the interview H had prayed that I would feel peace in my heart if this was the right job.  Part of me had just dismissed that as fuzzy spiritual waffle.  I agree and know its biblical but have no real idea what "Peace in my heart" meant.  But almost as soon as I got to the school I felt comfortable and welcome; like this was a good place for me to be.  It wasn’t a deep spiritual feeling or anything but the peace we had prayed for.  It's nice when prayers and real life meet.

      Been thinking a lot about I quote from 'The Divine Conspiracy' about living for an audience of one (ie. God).  So often when I do anything its either with concerns or hopes about what other people will think.  Does it make me look cool or stupid?  Does it make me look a good Christian.  I find it too easy to live looking for a reward here rather than from God.  But at the end of the day only the one’s evaluation will matter.

      Had a very good time at Spring Harvest over Easter.  H and I were working in Evolution (17+).  And had a lot of fun pretending to be artists again.  On Good Friday we did a series of installations on the Stations of the Cross that worked very well.  Unfortunately I forgot to take any photos but will recycle the ideas again I'm sure.  We were with some great guys from a lot of different Churches and Organisations and it was really cool to see how everything pulled together and gelled.   H. even mamaged to launch her celebrity career by a (brief) appearence on songs of praise.  While we were there we saw a bit of Andy Hunter's gig.  He has an excellent album called Exodus out which covers a wide range of dance styles.  His set was part club, part gig and part alt worship event but has got me thinking about the DJ led worship a bit.  Previously I've seen it as an ambient background to do something over (like prayer stations, liturgy or little rituals) but he really led worship by combining the roles of DJ and MC.  Weren’t many there, but it was excellent and I had a lot of fun dancing.

      Went to look at some of the ART Sheffield festival a while back, it was a citywide festival of contemporary art.  There was some really good stuff displayed in different venues around the city.  One piece I found particularly gripping.  It was called “Black Thread” and (I think) looked at the impact of violence.  It was displayed in a large post-industrial warehouse.  The room was dark and we were immediately disorientated coming from a bright sunny day into a pitch-black cavern.  A continuous thumping noise added to the feeling of confusion and suspense.  The combination of the dark and this ominous noise was very powerful and played on fears of unknown terror and violence very well.  Eventually we plucked up courage and walked into the hanger.  As our eyes adjusted to the (lack of) light we saw on a video screen in the middle of the room a round wrapped object being smacked again and again.  The whole thing was very unsettling but prompted an almost cathartic response.  Powerful.  This was the weekend that Fridge was up to stay.  It was great to spend time with you,  Hope you enjoyed it.

      Its been an emotional weekend.  I've finished teacher training and said goobye to a lot of my new friends from that.  I had a lot of fun with them all over the year so now I am a little sad.  If any of those guys ever read this then thanks for the year,  I appreciate you.     Thursday night was our end of year ball which was excellant.  I danced like a loon for a long time and so did H.  I like balls, I used to be quite a snob about cheese at discos etc but had too much fun to remain purist.  Maybe its age mellowing me.  I can never work out if people who comment about my dancing are laughing or not?  But I have fun.  Then on friday H and I drove down to Royston to see my family.  It was great to spend some time with them and catch up a bit.  We got spoilt and were given lots of good food and drink.  It was very refreshing to talk with them about my life and their life.  We had lots to catch up on.  On Saturday we went to see Nicklas Nickleby.  It was a charming Film which was gently playful and very upliftng.  My brother was in the play at school but it wasn't anything like the film.  I think both must have selectedly edited it very differently.   A story.    Over easter my Uncle died, he was close to the family and it was  a shock but I couldn't get to the funeral and was at the end of teaching practice so pushed it out of my mind.  Well my dad gave me the address he had spoken at the funeral and in it was a message my uncle had written to be read out.  It  really hit me and I cried.  I don't cry very often at all and I'm glad that I did but everyone had done their mourning already, so it was a private moment and my turn to say goodbye.  Fell asleep in front of Glastonbury as usual.  Maybe I'll go next year.  Two excellant websites:  urlLink www.flipflopflyin.com  and  urlLink www.orisinal.com .  The first is a very personal site by a designer guy of pictures and animations.  Its very whimsical in parts and most is just cool silliness but their are bits that can be very emotive and bittersweet.  I cna spend hours looking round it.  The second is a site of Flash animation games.  They are very well designed and have an anime feel to them but are simple and very infectious.  both worth time spent.  Was listening to the Alex Absalom's sermon from sunday at the teaching service.  He used the word nuance in his talk (which was very good and was about prophecy and the prophetic.)  It struck me as a very good word to go into a sermon and one which we should use more.  It seems that we don't often linger for longer enought to notice nuance any more.  We are just grabbed by the bold bright colours or the slogan so I was gla d that people in the church still reflect on it.

      Beautiful sunny warm day.  Just been at John's stag doo.  We were pretty civilised really I thought.  On an unrelated note:  been struggling with church and mission tensions a bit.  On one hand I really want to get involved in the pioneering stuff.  Set up an emerging church cafe, or alt worship experience or something. Just so frustrated with status quo low risk church and christianity.  On the other I want to be effective and build something lasting through relationships.  And I'm committed into stuff right now and more importantly see the authority that I'm under and the need to stay within their mandate.  But does that mean that I can't be wiered and do the cool stuff too?  And where are the people to do it with?  Hmm.  Do I have to sacrifice one for the other?

      Was round at Tim's last night for tea.  As we left Helen mentioned  "When your out with boys you only ever talk about music and films"    ooops  Saw Buffallo Soldiers on Friday,  cool.  Its heartwarming to know their are dissenting voices in the USA.  Speaking of dissent:  urlLink Not in our Name Music  is v. exciting.  Maybe I've discovered it a little late but it's still relevant.  Awoke on Saturday morning to views of builders all around our house, apparently we're about to be sandblasted- sounds exciting.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRANCIS!!!!!

      Banksy is a graffiti artist based in London. His work is amazing, creative, subversive and profound.  His  urlLink website  has pictures from a recent London show called turf war and also this  urlLink Story ,  which blew me away.

      Always interesting to see what has and hasn't been nominated for the  urlLink Mercury Music Prize 2003  and also fun checking out some of the more obscure nominations.  Not too bad a list this year.  Good to see that Lemon Jelly are there, thats one of my favourites from the last year and its nice that Athlete are doing well.  Blur's absence is not surprising considering the Gorrilaz thing in 2001 but where are Massive Attack!?!  Its surely as good as the Radiohead Album.  In my opinion Manitoba should be there too, but not sure many people would agree with me there.

      As I went to the supermarket today I came across an old Amstrad computer monitor lying broken on the floor.  It looked almost organic, like some strange dead animal.    It hadn’t had a peaceful death.  The screen was smashed and it’s cable lay beside it; as though it was been reaching out for something to grasp on to.  Perhaps it had been tortured by the kind of people that pull wings off flies, or maybe it was thrown from the wall above in a parody of the famous rock-n-roll cliché.  Strangely it looked as though it had been re-arranged after its crash, the glass from the screen was in a pile by it and the monitor was face up and looked too awkward to have just landed there.  Maybe a computer funeral director had come to re-arrange the corpse and make it more palatable to passers by.  Others noticed this too.  As I was looking an elderly man walked past and asked:   “Is that modern art then?”    Perhaps it was.    It was a sad scene, enhanced by the wet weather.  But it was also kind of beautiful.  The glass and metal shimmered and sparkled and I was glad to have discovered it.    I went home to get my camera and took some photos. If they’re any good I’ll put them up here.  The monitor made me think of the things we humans do with objects, feelings and relationships that we consider obsolete…and it made me glad I wasn’t a computer monitor.

      Was chatting to my friend about one of my favourite books; Girlfriend in a Coma by Douglas Coupland.  He's just got to the end and we both liked this quote:  "You'll soon be seeing us walking down your street, our backs held high, our eyes dilated with truth and power.  We might look like you, but you should know better.  We'll draw our line in the sand and force the world to cross our line.  Every cell in our body explodes with the truth.  We will be kneeling in front of the Safeway, atop out-of-date textbooks whose pages we have chewed out.  We'll be begging passers by to see the need to question and question and question and never stop questioning until the world stops spinning.  We'll be adults who smash the tired, exhausted system  We'll crawl and chew and dig our way into a radical new world.  We will change minds and soulds from stone and plastic into linen and gold-- that's what I believe.  That's what I know."  A good mission statement, a good vision, I like it.

      Despite it's name  urlLink Jockey Slut  is one of the Best music magazines around.  I like its attitude a lot more than some of the other Dance Glossies and shows that them music is still much more than hedonism, drugs and semi nudity (unlike some "dance" magazines) it also does a wicked CD series that rounds up the best in alternative dance and electronica and is alsways full of gems.  This month's magazine has a retrospective on the Chemical Brothers and a feature on Banksy.

      Bought an Orchid on Friday.  Always thought they were particularly interesting/beautiful plants and this one is no exception.  It feels like quite a young proffessional thing to own (even though it was cheap at safeway).  They are such unique plants.  I've heard that they are quite hard to keep alive so I hope we don't kill it.

      I can see the world again!  I got a new pair of glasses on Friday and everything is clear and crisp again.  Its very exciting, altough I have been looking at my feet and being shocked how far away they are.  I celebrated my new vision by going to Froggart Edge with my friend Graham and enjoying seeing the views.  Later Friday evening I was walking back from Ben's house and noticed the light reflecting off cars and windows.  It felt as though I was walking in a photo.  Its interesting, like I take for granted what I see every day but the glasses have given me a new level of clarity and meant that I appreciate familiar sites anew.  Thank you for my sight God.

      New Favourite Band!!!  NY Art Punk meets New Order/Happy Mondays style House/Dance.   urlLink The Rapture  are totally awesome.  New album and tour coming up.  Other Favourite new Band are my friend Ben Fuller's band "Baby Ingrid" sadly no website yet for them but if you know Ben (or maybe some of the others) then try and get them to sell you an EP.  It is amazingly eclectic yet manages to feel coherent and beautiful.  Ben says they're going to do some gigs soon so GO SEE THEM!

      I recently wrote to  urlLink H&M   asking about their policies about social responsibility.  The brochure that they sent back had this quote from Rolf Eriksen the CEO.  "At H&M we always focus on our customers and over the past few years, we have clearly seen that our customers are getting more and more involved in such issues as the environment and social responsibility.  Our own employees are also becoming increasingly interested in these issues.  This has convinced me that it is important for H&M to be committed to it's responsibilities in these areas to retain the confidence of our customers and employees in the long term."  It would be easy to be cynical about such statement but I don't want to.  I want to believe that things can change for the better and that maybe even corporations can be persuded to act responsibly.  I want to believe that we can make a difference so this gave me hope.  H&M's full code of contact can be found at their website.

      I've been using my computer quite a lot in my personal spiritual life recently, meditating on different Images, prayers and scriptures.  There's something about that I find a lot more accessible than a daily reading booklet.  Maybe it is the interactivity of it all, I dunno, but it works for me.  Anyhow, These are seven simple animations/meditations on the   urlLink .:::rejesus - spirituality - seven sayings:::.  of Jesus as he hung on the cross.  They are very simple but extremely powerful.  The whole  urlLink Rejesus  site is well worth looking at as well.

      Was a beautiful August morning as I walked to work today; warm and hazy.  I love this time of year, when things begin to change from Summery to Autumnal.  Its as though nature is putting on one last big show before things start to die and so puts out flowers and fruit extravagantly.  There are colours in abundance but even better are the fragrances of flowers and fruit which all mix together into a heady cocktail.  And always there is just the faint smell of decay.   Potent stuff.

      " It's been malled.   It's the upshot of some dumb decision that to compete with them–to compete with N'Sync and Friends and Stephen King and Matt and Katie and Abercrombie & Fitch and Jackie Chan and AOL and Sesame Street–the faithful should turn from their centuries-old tradition of fashioning transcendent art and literature and passionate folk forms such as gospel music and those outsider paintings in which Jesus has lime green bat wings and is hovering lovingly above the Pentagon flanked by exactly thirteen flying saucers, and instead of all that head down to Tower or Blockbuster and check out what's selling, then try to rip it off on a budget if possible and by employing artists who are either so devout or so plain desperate that they'll work for scale."  The quote is from a very interesting and thought provoking  urlLink article   by Walter Kirn, GQ's literary editor, on Christian subculture.     I found this on  urlLink Jonny Baker's blog , an always inspiring site that I regularly pinch things from.

      Been getting  urlLink New Internationalist  for a while and love what it does and stands for.  Sometimes the magazine can be a bit hard going.  Not so with this month's edition though.  Its all about music.  There's some sobering remarks about the links between big record labels and arms/electronics corporations and some excellant articles about different groups using music for protest, celebration or community development.  A very healthy read.   It also comes with an excellant free CD called Songs of Dissent that's been put together by the  urlLink Peace not War Coalition .  Lots of fresh, exciting music with a real message and well worth listening to.

      So its been a while, went away to Portugal with my family for a week or so.  Had a brilliant time!  Lots of Sun etc and very relaxing.  I'm developing expanded ambitions for this blog so might sort out a photo album type thing from the Holiday.     When we got home we found that the house had been sandblasted.  This is good because its now red not dirty white but bad for a number of reasons.  One such reason was that our garden began to resemble a nuclear waste land.  Our flower and herb pots were worst hit, and things that had been green and leafy were now short, grey stalks.  But life is stronger than death!  Three days later and theres green shoots everywhere again.  Resurrection, cool.

      Uncannily accurate I'd say. Still 27% isn't too bad.     You are   27%   geek     You are a geek liaison, which means you go both ways. You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator. 		  		 Normal:  Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend.   		 You [to Geek]:  We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!   		 Geek [to You]:  I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!   		 You [to Normal]:  He wants to know if he gets overtime.   		      urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com

      Been struggling a lot with questions about belief recently, so I thought it would be a good exercise to re-visit what I do believe.  Write a creed I suppose,  so here goes....  I believe that God is a personality with characteristics that can be known (to a point).  I believe that God chose to be like us and visited earth for while.  While he was here he asked a lot of questions, laid out some guidelines and then sacrificed himself so we'd have a hope of following him.  I believe that God is still present and active in the world in many ways, some of which we have seen, some of which we can't.  Some characteristics of God I think I've discovered are...                                       Holiness - There is a standard of perfection, it is God                   Justice - Things are wrong and need to be put right                   Mercy - Even though things are wrong its better to let people off as much as possible than to judge them                    Grace - People are people, they need space to grow and god gives these to us all                   Redemption - Nothing is beyond hope, people, communities and the world can still be saved                          Love - People need it and its stronger than death   I believe these things can be learned and practiced in my own life.  There, its a bit messy and tentative but then can the story of God and people be reduced into nice simple points?  I'm not sure.

      In fact the whole weekend has been excellent. Spent the afternoon  in the Park with Expressionistas playing Ultimate Frisbee in the park (which suddenly became quite a contact sport due- not entirely- to a future brother in law).  Just before we left off roader pulled up and unpacked a large hot air balloon.  The spectacle of this balloon inflating and then taking off turned a lot of us into little children again.  It was a beautifully site.  Afterwards we went back to Tim's and, inspired by the idea of self propelled flight, began constructing our own hot air balloons from greaseproof paper, candles and string.  We spent the good part of the evening making the "balloons and eventually even the cynics joined in.  It was fun, childlike and creative.  Sadly nothing actually took off, eventually the paper caught fire and our dreams of flight went up in smoke.  So we lit a bonfire instead.  Once again the evening felt like family.

      Went to see  urlLink Gilad Atzmon  at the non-political Club this Friday.  I've been wanting to go to the jazz nights there for a while but never made it until  now.  Great place, great feel.    Gilad and the Orient House ensemble were amazing, The music itself was a blend of Jazz with Jewish and Arabic influences.  The band was made up of people from a variety of nations including Israel and Palestine and as such the music is a real prophetic and political statement of anger, hope and reconciliation.  The fusion of influences works extremely well and I found watching the artists collaborate and play with each other musically to be completely mesmerising.  Gilad himself was warm and funny, his asides during the music undercut any danger that the evening could become too pretentious.  Showed me again what music can be.  Thanks for taking me Ben.

      I really shouted at a class this week, not just acting, like almost anger.  It was quite convincing I thought and nearly got them listening until the worst happened.  I was at the peak of my amplified announcement when I noticed a large bubble of spit flying out of my mouth.  By now it was too late to stop.  I continued speaking.  The spit continued flying across my desk and plopped gracefully on between to keen girls on the front row.    What should I do?  Acknowledge it and laugh?  Oh No!  Ignore it and carry on, better, but then I become the stupid teacher who spits when he's cross and doesn't know it.  there are easier ways to earn a living.   Got the  urlLink Flip Flop Flyin Minipops Poster  as a late anniversary present from Helen today,  Hooray!  Thank You H.

      A very full weekend.  Half night of prayer with Expression on Friday was fun but hard-work (me a wimp). The last post was kinda in response to it but also in response to my tiredness.  The leaders day was fun, Mike and Sally came and talked/answered questions then we formed a factory line to fill up lots of bags.  (Expression = Slave labour apparently).   The highlight though was Sunday night in the service and welcome lounge.  It was the time when all the plans etc.  really seemed to fit together,  the feel of it was great.  Tim's DJing was perfect, The candles, the food, the chilling - it was all great and there were lots of people there (inc. a few freshers).  Seemed to be church in the best possible way and I hope we can take the best bits of it into our regular celebrations and (probably more likely) clusters.  It was one of those weekends that was so full that it seems like it was at least four weekends cramped into 1.      Wet lunch at School today, the Y7's looked so desperate for someone to entertain them that I ended up organizing Hangman and 20 questions which was a lot of fun.

      Where do you go when your faith just doesn't answer the major questions in your life?  Am I asking the wrong things? Am I looking the wrong way?   I find reassurance in the fact that Jesus seemed to encourage questions just as much as he gave certainties but I still feel vulnerable and lonely on this journey.  I guess the temptation would be to run, but that is where the crunch is.  Do I leg it from relationship with God, People and the world or do I work it out with them.  I just want to know you.

      I went to see  urlLink Spirited Away  last night.  It is a truly amazing Japanese anime film.  The animation and detail is breathtaking.   It follows a young girl whose family get lost in a deserted theme park.  The closest parellels are with Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz and some of the early, classic Disney Films.  Much of the symbolism and imagery seemed completly alien and exotic to my western eyes.  It seemed to present childhood as a mix of beauty, awe, alienation and unease.

      Seems that I spend all my life shouting at teenagers!  I realized I'd become teachery when on Wednesday I was talking with Helen and slipped into teacher mode to bellow "Just be quiet and listen to me"  Oops!  First Expression Celebration last night was fantastic.  About 45 people there which gave it a cozy feel.  I found the worship was ace, had a cool ambient feel to it- at times if you squinted you could pretend Zero 7 were leading worship.  I like the idea of worship being led by just a singer + musicians not a (usual male) singer/guitarist led band.  It gave a lot to it.    Rich talked about vision and where we're going about getting revelation from God, being in family relationship and being real with the world.    There were loads of people I didn't recognise which was cool and I talked to some lovely people.  We then went to the Hilsborough Hotel which must be the unexpected gem of the night.  A very nice Hotel Bar that is smart but humble feeling.  It has a Garden that overlooks the Ski Village (+ Mecca bingo) and a wide selection of special ales/beers.  There were enough of us there to bring down the tone of the place considerably.  Could be a tradition starting?     The whole evening felt like we were embarking on new journeys as a family.

      First week at my new School now done and it went pretty well.  My first day with pupils was pretty bewildering but I wasn't the only one in that situation.  Teaching Geography and RE as well as History which is fun but challenging and have some good classes and some other ones.  But I think I'm getting the hang of it.  One of the best bits was doing break duty on Friday.  I was out in the School Yard and a lot of the kids (who apparently I teach, but most them I could not recognise) would come and talk to me- was fun.    So yeah,  I'm glad I'm a teacher.   Finally saw Donnie Darko the other day.  Wanted to watch it for ages but never seemed to get there.  Wow... what a film.

      Church was in the form of two gigs this week,  Stoney at the Fez Club was first on Wednesday.  The act before him was loud and enthusiastic punk with a lead singer like Iggy Pop, very cool.  Mark was excellant - some of his new songs were brilliant.  Then 24 Hour Parking at the deep end at Hillsborough - a great venue.  10th leper were excellant beardrock, quirky misrablecore at its best.   Then Gareth Robinson and band were fantastic all his worship songs without the annoying nice sensibilities they have in church.  The band looked like they were having fun too.  Behind the bar was a screen running some interesting video loops, candles burning, leaves falling etc.  it added to the atmosphere, was the kind of thing I'd seen at alternative worship events- excellant.  Thanks to all who put the gigs on.

      Finding the current discussions on Anglican Bishops v. sad.  I guess the stakes are high for both involving a potent mix of sexual identity and belief in who men are, in what love is and in what God's word says.    For me, I think I know what is in the bible about it all but I know too that we re-interpret other parts with no qualm of conscience and call it context or whatever, so it seems a bit hypocritical to say that we can't do others.  So maybe that makes me more of an anglican than an anglican't - but most of my friends would prob be the other way round.    Most of all I am deeply saddened that Christians are allowing themselves to be shown as reactionary, uncaring and unmoving.  But I can see why it is that way.  If you believe that its God's unchanging word at stake then there's a lot to fight for.  Think too thought that we are a bit too ready to see ourselves (Evangelical Christians I mean) as a put upon minority.  Maybe in this case we are not the minority.  Maybe here we are the oppressive institution.    Lord Have mercy.

      Been a little ill this last week and so feeling sorry for myself.  Stayed off School for two days which felt a bit strange but also quite fun.  Much better now.  Time off gave me time to finish both the Silmarilion and  urlLink Liquid Church  by Pete Ward which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Lots in it to think about and probably more will emerge as I reflect.    One thing that is at the forefront of my mind was Pete's discussion of the Trinity as Characterised by relationship.  I think he was suggesting that God is found in the Relationship between Father, Son and Spirit as much (or more) than in their individual personalities.  I found this way of thinking about the trinity, as dynamic loving relationship both mindboggling and exciting.  On the mind boggling front, how do you get to know a relationship!?! But to think that at the core of the universe is loving relationship - coooool.  It also gave a different way of thinking of mission, suddenly I am no longer having to "do mission" but rather get involved in the dynamic movement of God.    Found some of it quite frustrating because it seems that my immediate church family at St Tom's is moving away from the whole emerging thing at a fairly fast rate.  Its the kind of book I don't imagine many here would approve of and that saddens me.  Been feeling this a lot recently. I am personally convinced of the need to re-imagine mission based church but it feels as though the ways I would like to do this will be going in a different direction to St Tom's.  I guess my frustrating comes from having a dream about emerging church, having precious memories of experiments I've done with people in it before and on the other hand wanting to stay part of a church family and serve their vision.   Read this at  urlLink Moogaloo , it gave me hope...  "His promise over our generation still stands. He calls us a prophetic generation. We weren't just supposed to be the Mac generation, or the Christian rock generation. We were actually supposed to carry a pretty heavy mantle of creative power and prophecy, as well as a gift from God to name our elders and the power generation coming after us. "

      One of the things that I love about Sheffield is its proximity to the Peak district.  It feels quite unusual to be in a city and yet after 20 minutes drive to be in the middle of moorland.   Spent an afternoon in the (partial) wilderness yesterday and felt much better for it.  Wind, hot air balloons, highland cattle, cliffs.  Just what I needed.  Now that the wild is accessible in a few minutes where are our limits?  On a related theme of travel and connectedness, Got a letter from the parents of Rex, whom we sponsor, he'd drawn a picture for us to.  So cool to think that my money, thoughts and prayers are having an impact on someone's life so far away.  SO often its the other way round, my clothes are made in a sweatshop or the oil in my car is from who knows where.  Heartily recommend  urlLink sponsoring .  Feeling bit rough this morning.  hope it goes.  Had a fight, a child being sick and a girl crying in my classes on Friday.  My first hat-trick!

      Went to see this on Thursday with H.  Beautiful, beautiful film.  Parts of it are like watching sunshine.  It is a very gentle and tender examination of family, love and trust.    What I found most interesting was the way food was treated.  Several times in the film meals appeared almost as sacrament.  Allowing people access to family life and rebuilding relationships, I liked that.   urlLink Go see

      This was a beautiful week, misty mornings, crisp evenings, bright sun and chills.  I love the beginning of Autumn, it's so abundant, as though everything is putting on one last show before winter.                                          A very lazy weekend, H. and I haven't really been out at all.  There are times when I just need that, get all peopled out and need to just chill.  I guess its one of them.  Saw the archbishop on Conversations with Rowan Williams yesterday evening and thought he was excellent.  How refreshing to have a high level Christian engaged in humble and honest debate with the thinkers of the day about issues that people actually care about.  I found myself thinking Jesus might do the same, now and again.

      I read this yesterday morning, its possibly my favorite image in the bible.  Something I aspire to:  Psalm 131:  My heart is not proud, O Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. But I have stilled and quotient my soul; like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me,  O Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and for evermore.  There are times when I know I let myself get far too puffed up and concerned with great ideas and big thoughts.  At those times these images can have much to say.  Sometimes its good to question, but often its good to be quite, be with my Mother and let her guide me.  (it feels quite strange to me to refer to God as mother, something I'm not used to - but I guess that's another reason why I like this psalm.  Cos there is a massive difference between the Father role normally associated with God and the mother role which is hinted at in the bible a few times.  Feels odd but shouldn't.)

               First Sunday of Advent!!!!  I love this time of preparing.  The promise, the not quite there yet.  Seems to me that the world needs the light more than ever right now.  And in my own life I really want to know more deeply the God who has walked among us.  These were three quotes from some Advent readings this morning:  "People of Israel, lets live by the light of the lord"  "Night is almost over and the day will soon appear"  Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear"  I guess they sum up what I want from this Advent and Christmas.

      Went to see Love Actually with Helen on Wednesday.  Yes it seemed to suggest that English people were all rich, hesitant and living in London, yes the start at the airport was manipulative and has been done better before, yes it featured more cameos than a series of Friends.  But none of that stopped me from loving it.  The affect it had on the audience was interesting; everyone came out with silly big grins.

      Been noticing more this week how beautiful this creation is.  There was the crisp Monday morning where the whole world was frosted and sparkling, silent and magical against a bright blue and golden sky.  At first I missed it, grumbling to God about the cold, and about getting the car started.  But then I sat down and saw it.  Amazing.    Then there was the kestrel on the way in on Tuesday, hovering over some unlucky prey, so graceful and yet very deadly.  I almost missed it and drove past.  And then on the way home today the sky was full of so many blues and in the centre was the smallest crescent of a moon, like a gem in the sky.    Its an amazing world and I just wander by with my head down most of the time.

      Been a lot of posts around about the war over the last couple of days and I've been biting my tongue a bit.    At the time of the war I suppose I was on the fence, but since then I've become more and more uneasy about it.  Not because of a general "war is bad" approach but because it feels like we have joined the side of an aggressive state.  There are several reasons for my unease.  I don't think the war was necessary and I don't think all other avenues of diplomacy were investigated.  I certainly don't think that either the terrorist or weapons of mass destruction arguments were sufficient (remember, that's what we were told we were going for).  And the I'm glad Saddam's gone argument doesn't convince me either.  I mean yes he's gone but hasn't that just created a vacuum for more problems.  Americas not likely to risk elections that lead to an elected fundamentalist group are they?  So what are the alternatives,  probably a western sponsored regime (which lets not forget, is how Bin Laden and Hussain both started out) is that what the people of Iraq will want (that's a genuine question- I mean, I don't know.)   I also can't get away from the suspicion that this war was largely fought for less than noble reasons, oil, rebuilding contracts, blind anger.  We seem to have got involved in something that is purely about self interest.  Now that in its self is nothing new but to hear it clouded in the language of religious and moral crusade is very worrying to me.  I haven't yet seen (admittedly I'm not there) much evidence of the promised aid and rebuilding packages that were spoken so much about at the beginning of the war.  The cynic in me wonders if this is going to happen at all, and how much of it will get to the people that need it.  I am also anxious about wider concerns, like the way prisoners are being kept in Guantanamo without being charged and the rumours of torture and co-coersion going on there.  Like the links between this little adventure and other American links in the middle east such as the whole Israel and Palestine thing.  But most of all about the way these unjust wars have been coated in Religious, quasi Christian rhetoric.  We've been damaged by letting that happen in our past and we'll be damaged again.  I admit I don't know the issues that well and this is all very tentative but its why I'm more of a peacer than a busher.  I wrote  a bit about it in August as well, and that is  urlLink here .  Whatever, even with my less than detailed knowledge I can't help thinking that America (and so by connection us their ally) hasn't exactly been a force for world peace, stability and justice over the last few years.  Oh two final things.    The anti-protesters thing really gets me.  Protest is vital in healthy democracy, as vital as voting.  It gives people a voice and allows a legitimate outlet for strong feelings.  I admit, maybe some of the tactics are not so clever, but think about how you act when you're passions are roused.  I'm not asking you to agree with them but stop whinging about them disrupting your day. You'll be grateful when they start protesting about your lost rights.  And voting; maybe people don't vote because threes no visible option for them. I kinda feel that not voting has less to do with apathy (as shown by the number who risk confrontation with the police) and more to do with disenfranchised people.  I've voted in all the major ones I could, but to be honest I'm beginning to wonder why.

       urlLink I am not involved in emerging church  is a very cool story.  Particualrly like this quote/definition:    "emerging church is a passion for people who are stuck with a congregation of people who don't understand half of what they say. emerging church has indeed emerged from the big stone doors of the so called local church to move themselves (usually a 18-30s group) down the road to the pub. the emerging church can now express themselves in the language they use (graphics, candles, trance music, beer, whatever)."

      never try and actually teach when it is a non-uniform day!!! Left feeling like I was such a bad teacher.  all the kids were hyper.  On a more pleasing school note my Y7s were shocked and amazed that a teacher knew who Eminem was and owned a Blueprint skateboard.  They then proceeded to quiz me with about tricks and bands (can I do a kick flip? - No. Have I heard of System of a Down? - Yes but never heard their music).  I've got to be careful though.  I so don't want to become the try hard to be trendy teacher that is totally ineffectual and laughed at.    One thing yesterday really scared me,  a british-asian kid in my class who I get on with very well came in all excited and jumpy.  He had seen Bin Laden on the television the night before and had heard about the bomb in Turkey and it had seemed to make his day.  He spent the whole lesson telling me about it.  Found the experience very alarming, was it just teenage boy bravado or was he really talking about his heroes?  Didn't know what to say or how to react but it made me understand the talk about fighting for hearts and minds a lot more- and how far off that is.  God have mercy on us.

      Interesting day at School, had a fight and a child try to leave through a window in my lesson.  But topping both of these was the grafitti I found on a table at the back of my room.  It said...  "Mr Askew is a f___ing bastard!"  so now I have permanence of a kind.  I have made my mark on the school.  Not sure if I should be happy or sad. maybe someone could do one of those quizzes about that!?  (sorry if I offend you, don't mean to).

      Apologies for the long absence - been pretty busy lately.   This weekend I was in Reading with Grey Dog and Matthew.  Was great to catch up with the boys.  We spent Saturday in London (not been down there for over a year) and went to a number of very cool exhibitions.  First up we went to  urlLink yes yes y'all  a interesting if somewhat reverential cultural history of the first 10 years or so of Hip Hop.  It was extremely interesting but a little disconcerting in its retrospectiveness.  Does hip hop need a museum yet - is it that dead?  I don't think so.  The show was staged in  urlLink The Hospital   which looks to be a very exciting new venue - if only I lived in London eh?  After that we walked to the National Gallery for Bill Viola's exhibition  urlLink "The Passions"   this completely blew me away.  Bill Viola is a video artist.  His heavily referenced renaissance Christian art as well as non-western influences.  According to the gallery...  "Bill Viola's new work explores the power and complexity of human emotions. Visually stunning and psychologically gripping, Viola's works are at the cutting edge of technology but they are also deeply rooted in the art of the past.  Using actors, shown in silence and extreme slow motion, "The Passions" probe and reveal the nature of overwhelming emotion."       The work was ultra contemporary and yet intimate, emotional and engaging- a lot of it was very worshipful too.  One piece, a huge installation called "The Crossing" ran a slow loop of a man walking towards the audience he arrives and stands still then he is drenched with water, until he is completely washed away and just the water remains.  Then the loop runs again with Fire.  It reminded me of Baptism and as I watched I found myself praying and asking God to fill me with his power, to wash me away and let me be lost again in him.  Amazing.  If you can get to it do.   Then it was a quick trip over the river and a coffee before we wit ito the Tate to see " urlLink 5 angels for the millennium "  another Viola installation (though this time much bigger) again very cool.    In the turbine hall of the Tate was a piece called " urlLink The Weather Project " the Artist, Olafur Eliasson had recreated the effect of a sun in the hall.  I wish I had my camera but had to settle for this postcard:     Its hard to see here but the top half is a reflection using the mirrored ceiling.  The "sun" filled the room with yellow light which was ethereial and uplifting.  The room was absolutely packed with people sitting around looking at the piece - like a crowd waiting for a festival gig.  People were bathing in the sun and playing with their reflections in the ceiling.  Again it made me think about worship, it was awesome but also very playful.  By now we were pretty arted out so headed out for some Vietnemese noodles and a few drinks.  Grey, thanks so much for the weekend it was excellant to catch up. Matt, always a pleasure to go anywhere with you.    All of this has got me thinkng about the way art and worship overlap and the two could be used together, but thats something I'll leave for now.

      Ruth makes a very good point about emerging Church stuff and St Thomas  urlLink here  I guess you're right.  Since I wrote the stuff a few weeks ago I've had to rethink a lot of what I said, and yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff happening.  Ooh and I like your story too.  Maybe I will follow your lead when I have a bit more time.  I guess I feel like I should apologies a bit for irresponsible blogging.  Like writing here somehow gives me the right to mouth off about everything that frustrates me.  Feel like I've been a bit over indulgent.  So erm... sorry.

      The first is a why don't we...    Why don't we use more pop songs in Church style worship?  If we are trying to develop a model of worship that empowers people to meet God where he is working in heir lives then shouldn't our songs reflect that.  Songs like (for example) Wake me up and Where is the love have (I think) a prayerfulness and also a real-ness that could be used powerfully in corporate worship plus when its beard on the radio or whatever I might remember the time we sung it might be prompted me more to worship.  Dunno if that made sense or not - but its been bubbling in my head for a while.   Second is a bit recycled from the excellent  urlLink Wild at Heart  .  Been thinking a lot about the revolutionary Jesus. Sure he was kind and gentle to people who needed it but he was also not shy of picking a fight.  For example look at the two times (I think) when he heals people on the Sabbath.  Both times he stands in the crowd and asks the religious leaders "Is it right to do this?" knowing they'll say no, and he'll heal the people anyway and embarrass the leaders.  Then there's the famous hard man Jesus story where he turns over all the tables in the temple because of the religious corruption and injustice going on there.  Even when he is in Gethsemane he is facing down the opposition with taunts;  "Why didn't you arrest me before  he asks, I've been in the city for days."  These were parts of the story that I knew but had forgotten.  They add to my image of Jesus.  Now he is itching for confrontation with darkness as well as gentle meek and mild.       This has two implications for me.  Firstly I'm following a fighter God who confronts injustice and oppression (spiritual and physical - they're both the same really) unflinchingly.  Doesn't that give me a mandate and challenge for action?  Secondly there is a challenge to my inside life.  Are there areas in my life that Jesus wants to pick a fight with.  What needs overturning in my attitudes, thoughts and actions.  Ouch.  I think God just got a little bigger.

      Inevitably breathing space on holiday has given me a fresher perspective so my posts from the week before half term seem a little cynical.  Sorry  Agree with Andy's comments on  urlLink Moogaloo  about my  urlLink earlier post .  But once we start questioning then where do we stop?  My big question is what becomes the barometer to help us measure what we should or shouldn't accept, isn't there a danger that we only believe what we see as familiar, understandable or acceptable.    Then again Jesus promised that the Spirit would lead us into all truth so maybe I need to be a bit more trusting and allow God to lead and work.   Perhaps too though there are some safety checks.  For example community, family.  If the spirit is leading us (Christian worldwide community) then there should we shouldn't feel to uncomfortable about accepting common held opinions and beliefs.  I guess we need to be accountable in our thinking as well as the other stuff.

      Came back from a few days in Pembrokshire with Helen and a few friends. I had an excellent time, lots of Castles, monasteries, beaches, seals, fires, food and drink and the perfect antidote to the previous few months.  Half Terms are great!!!  Thanks guys.  One of the places we visited was  urlLink St Govan's Chapel , a small chapel carved into cliffs in a very rocky cove.  Its named after a 6th Century Hermit and monk who lived for most of his life there (after he was chased by Pirate's, so the legend goes) worshipping and praying.  It was bleakly beautiful and fired my imagination.       While we were there messing around on the rocks a seal came swimming up to us.  It was fascinating to watch and seemed so playful weaving above and below the surface.          More photos will follow  Journey home was long - our fan belt went (again) outside Aberystwyth and had to be replaced (what is it with us and travel) So we were driving back all the twisty Snowdonia roads in the dark and wet.  Kinda fun.

          Union 1    My Lover said to me, "Rise up, my beloved, my fair one, and come away.  For the winter is past and the rain is over and gone.  The flowers are springing up and the time of singing birds has come, even the cooing of turtledove.  The fig trees are budding and the grape vines are in blossom.  How delicious they smell!  Yes , spring is here! Arise my fair one, and come away."  Song of Solomon 2:10-13.  I heard a loud shout from the throne saying,  "Look, the home of God is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people.  God himself will be with them.  He will remove all of their sorrows, and there will be no more death, or sorrow or crying or pain.  For the old world and its evils are gone forever.  And the one sitting on the throne said, "Look I am making all things new!" and then he said to me, "write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true." And he also said, "It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega-the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give the springs of the water of life without charge!  Revelation 21 3-6.   I don't have it too hard,  I am not living in a war zone, I am not on the poverty line, I do not suffer from a life threatening disease.  In many ways I am one of the global winners right now but I can still see a painfully large gap between the promises of the bible and the reality of our world.  We are still living in the firm grip of winter.  We know too well that there is death and sorrow and crying and pain.    The bible seems to promise union between God and Humanity and also between Humans themselves and yet God seems distant too this world and Men seem as opposed to one another as ever.  So what is going on?   And what do we do?   "So the word became flesh and lived here on earth among us.  He was full of love and faithfulness.  And we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only."      Christmas offers us hope and speaks of a union of worlds.  The word became flesh, God became human, Mr Eternity became subject to our mortality.  So he found out what Human life was like.  Because of his union with us we have an ally.  This gives me hope in our fragmented, dis-united world.  And causes me to keep hoping for the eventual, full, union of God and Man  God became man and grew within a womb.   In those 9 months the chasms between heaven and earth became a little closer.  Because of this we know their is more to this world.  Hidden within the surfaces of this world are deep oceans of eternity.  Nature and Supernature are united and the eternal does beckon us.  Christ stands at the door and knocks.  What is my answer?

      I've just read  urlLink The sleek shall inherit the Church  the article that talks about St Toms in the Observer and thought that on the whole it was very balanced, thoughtful and open-minded.  I agreed with many of the comments made about the Evangelical Church and also understand why an observer would be very non-plussed and suspicious of the way St Toms do church- it may seem sleek.  Although as someoe who gets very excited by the idea of "night-club style production" I think they exagerate the differences a little to much.    Also loved the way it celebrated the traditional Church of England and the things it offers.  Although it was trying to pit St Thomas and the traditional church against each other it didn't push the point too far and left room for people to make their own conclusions.  Two quotes sum it up well I think:  "Mostly, though, the evangelicals are merely filling a vacuum; they are reaching out to a post-millennium population that, according to almost every recent survey, feels itself to be spiritually and morally disenfranchised."  Very true, and:  "It's important to remember that evangelicalism might easily shift into another manner of worship over time. It's not necessarily inflexible in itself, and there can be different pockets of churchmanship within it."  This, again, I think is true, and is already happening.  I would say that we are part of shift as is all the other emerging church stuff going on around the world (and a load of other things going on I would have thought).  Hopefully the break that is threatened will not come, I pray that all people involved will be able to embrace the diversity of approaches and interpretations that are within the Anglican Church.  I believe that the breadth of the church right now is a great strength.  After all, I firmly believe that God will be doing more than one thing in his world at any one time,  so shouldn't his church be able to do the same?

         God Reaches Out...  If I had to summarize the message of my faith into a few words I could do a lot worse than this.  The story we tell is one of a God who is never content to stay alone, away from his people but who does all he can to reach us, to get through to us, to take hold of us.   God stretches out and crosses the divide between eternity and finite time.  He reaches out and beckons to us from the Heavens. "Come, be with me."  This, I believe is the true story, and within this narrative Christmas makes sense.  It is just one more example of God stretching, God reaching out into Human darkness and changing. This time his reach is into the womb, into Human form.   Later God will stretch again and as he does he will cry out and die.  And still he goes on reaching, beckoning, searching, calling.  Do I listen, do I respond to his stretch and allow his embrace or do I ignore and carry on remaining in shadows?  "when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears  and I've held your hand through all of these years"   "Evanescence - My immortal"

        "Evening Light"  Streets of Cotonou, Benin - Carley Rae  This is the picture for December in on the Mercy Ships Calender in our Dining Room.  Been thinking about the picture all week, partly because I was in Benin with the organisation for some time when I was 18 so felt like this was I place I knew.  The picture speaks to me on another level.  It would be easy to see Benin, through my western christian eyes as a dark place.  Voodoo was for many years the main religion there and the country has suffered much under French Colonists and then a Communist Regime.  But this picture seems to show a different story, one of vibrancy and light as well as (I imagine) need.  People are in the picture are busy with their own living and only one person seems to have noticed they are being watched.  She (the child on the right) seems just as transfixed by the taker as I am by the picture.  At this time of year this is a picture that challanges and encourages me.  I challenges me of my narrowmindedness.  As I look I am reminded that a white God being born into a snowy, rural English landscape?  Rather the contrast of lights in the night draws on a common imagery of light ad dark.  It reminds me that the nativity story at the heart of this season is a universal story of light in darkness and of God coming alongside his people, sharing their lives, their triumphs and their tragedies.  God, the illuminator.    Mercy Ships are the excellent Nautical wing of YWAM and send large ships to the less developed world with equipped with medical supplies and surgeries, relief and development teams and evangelism groups.

      Its such a great place.  Went out Christmas shopping today and got everyithing I wanted within 20 mins walk from home.  With its deli's, bookbinder, record shops and second hand book shops as well as all the little cool shops it has everything.  This is a great place to live!

      Been a pretty cool week really, school is much better and I'm enjoying the slow wind down (or up) to Christmas.  Was a dreadful teacher on Friday though and spent much of my Y7 lesson telling bad jokes.  an example: What was Agricola?  A early Roman soft drink brought to Britain in little red cans (historical explanation - Agricola was actually the first Roman Governer of Britain.  Its not big or clever I know but I just couldn't resist it.  Oh dear, tweed jackets with elbow patches seem closer than ever.  Had a lot of fun on Thursday at 24hr Parking.  All the bands were good but it was brilliant to see Baby Ingrid again.  So impressive!  Well done guys.   After Expression last night (very good) I went out with my work mates to a few bars and then to the Leadmill.  Was a good laugh and spent most of the night dancing.  But dum Ben lost his cloakroom ticket so is now sans coat.  To make it worse I put my mobile in the coat thinking " That will be safer there".  So not only am I jacketless but also (once again) without mobile communication.  Maybe I should just give up on the mobile front.  Still, other than that a fun night out.  5 days to the holidays!

      On the way home from work I was listening to a science program on Radio 4.  They were doing an experiment on personality types that involved lemon juice and cotton buds.  The hypothesis was that Introvert personality types produce more saliva than extroverts.  This is because they tick over at a higher level of stimulation and so are excited by the taste of the lemon juice more than extrovert types.  This explains why I am content to do stuff (reading, drinking coffee, sitting around) that others get fidgety and bored about.

      Meant to put this up yesterday as part of the [grid blog :: advent] but blogger wouldn't let me log on all day.  Still here it is a day late.  Song of the Wilderness (Advent)  The wilderness and the dry land shall rejoice, The desert shall blossom and burst into song  They shall see the glory of the Lord, the Majesty of our God.  Strengthen the weary hands,  and make firm the feeble knees.  Say to the anxious, 'Be strong, fear not,        your God is coming with judgement, coming with judgement to save you.  Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;  For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;  The ransomed of the Lord shall return with singing, with everlasting joy upon their heads.    Joy and gladness shall be theirs, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.                                    Selected bits of Isaiah 35, from Common Worship.  This is what we seek, this is the ancient promise.  A world of balance, justice and peace.   An Eden restored where the desert and wasteland become oases of life.  A world where God is among us and we are with him.  Its a dangerous dream that's been in our makeup since day one.  How many have died, or killed for their version of a new Zion?  How many sacrifices, how many compromises? How much blood spilt how many tears shed over this dream.  Surely this dream has been bankrupt by toil?  Surely I am naive, deceived or dangerous to still hold on?  I don't believe so.    This was the promise that Christ the GodMan embodied.  It was also a dream that came for him.  It took him to the cross, the grave and then beyond.    And now it has half come, that is not quite there.  And so we go on, frustrated, wounded, tired, disillusioned.  But dreaming.  Will I let it come for me?  Is this truly what I seek?    Or shall I settle for a more mediocre vision.

      I think I've been enjoying traffic jams a bit too much recently, I like to sit in them and watch the people in the car behind me through the mirror.  They're always doing such cool, normal, human things, like singing to an unkown song, or laughing at a joke or lighting a cigarette.  Fascinating.  It occured to me on the way home that this might be an odd thing to enjoy, like I'm spying into lots of private worlds, I hope not.  I hope everyone does it.  Am I a scary freak or is it ok?  Please let me know.

      I feel like its time to take an extended fast from blogging for a while.  Though its had some positive effects I'm not entirely convinced that its all been good.  So it will be distinctly quiet round here while I wait and see what's going on.  Bye.

      went out to Emma and Jude's birthday party last night to the forum only to be turned away for being too casual.   Now I know that my own particular approach to sartorial elegence slouches towards the scruffy side at times but the Forum?  THis was once the epitome of layed back coolness.  So I had to go home a change grumbling all the way about Style Fascists but deep down being cross with my self that I am no longer cool.  After that the night was a lot of fun though.

      you must go and see " urlLink Lost in Translation " it is amazing.  The film makes you understand the feeling of alienation and otherness of a differen culture extremeley well.  Its about lots of things, feeling stuck, feeling alone, finding someone who might help you and commitment...and the soundtrack is great too.    Went to look at our first house in Hillsborough today.  First step!

      Bad news first.  The Ecclesall non-political club is going to be sold, sad in itself but this probably also means the end of the Jazz club there.  (I've only been there once so am probably not too qualified to be sad but liked the idea of it and alsways wanted to go more).  but  Very good news.  Sheffield has a new Jazz club on Arundel Street.  Its called  urlLink The One Eleven Club  and opens on Tuesday 13th January.  Don't know as much about Jazz as I like to think I do so the listings don't mean a lot too me except that the fantastic  urlLink Gilad Atzmon  is playing there on February 17th, 18th and 19th (a little consolation to  urlLink Helen  and I for not getting Damien Rice tickets).

      been enjoying the  urlLink Douglas Coupland  site.  Found the Hey Nostradamus! section especially powerful.  Especially the little flash animation there.  Gave Helen the book for Christmas but haven't started it yer.  Going to savour it once I've finished the Corrections.  There is a short story competition he's attached to  urlLink here  actually the site that's running the comp is called  urlLink Pulp Net  and looks pretty cool too.   (Thanks Tim)

      While I was writing the last post our elderly next door neighbour appeared at the door distraughtly.  Her water pipe had come off the wall and was leaking on the floor.  I know nothing about plumbing but thought it would be better to do something than nothing so got buckets and newspapers and tried to reassure.  I felt extremely useless and unhelpful really particularly as she would not let us take round food or tea or anything.  God please look after her.

      Been chewing this over a lot over the Christmas break, Helen gave me "A new kind of Christian" by Brian McLaren for Christmas and I went through it very quickly.  Also been looking at lots of Posts on it throughout different parts of the blogosphere.  So here goes an attempt to organise my thoughts.  Postmodernity is a bit of a buzzword and in some ways a clich?.  I know a lot of people who would fid the term disenfranchising because it is seen as something faddy or associated with grumpy, obnoxious young people (like me I guess) or as something very pretentious and frustrating (I remember many times sitting in the pub with people from my final year in History grumbling about our "rethinking history" course and postmodern academics because it was undermining everything we'd learnt in the last 3 years).  Despite this, though, it is still the best label for a deep and profound change that is taking place in culture.  Brian McLaren describes it as a change equal to the shift from Medieval to Early Modern thinking that started during the Rennaisance.  It is, therefore, something that will not go away or pass, if anything the cultural change will grow.    Helen and I have often had discussions that have started or ended with the phrase "But we know lots of people our age who don't seem to be affected by postmodernism.  That may be so but is, I now think, because we are still at the beginning of a period of change, not because it is insignificant.  The number of people who are not affected will probably dwindle.  As  urlLink my four walls'   Lucas posted recently: "culture is culture is culture and an idol is an idol is an idol. When culture becomes our idol we are missing the point. We have a daunting task of separating what modernism has pasted on to Christianity and what is essential or basic. And we will have to be more careful as we engage a postmodern world that we don't do the same thing."  For me this is the biggest challenge.  I think in the past I have been too rebellious and not revolutionary enough.  In the past my desire has been for the Church to change so that it can better reach postmodern people.  I'm now beginning to wonder if we need to go further and reimagine much of how we function as Christians in a postmodern society (bearing in mind that I am a pomo too).    Many of the different streams of Christianity that have emerged over the last 200 years were excellent at coping in the modern context.  Many were God inspired and have served the Kingdom well.  They all, however, were in some way syncretistic with the Modern era.  All fused elements of their culture to the Gospel, McLaren and many others have examined these elements more thoroughly and more humbly than I could.  If we are to continue in the postmodern age will we need to allow the Church to become post-evangelical, post-charismatic, and post-liberal?  By this I do not mean turn our backs on these traditions, for they have much to tell us, but rather to carefully look at each and separate the modern from the everlasting in each.  Pre-modern expressions of Christianity probably have much to offer us here.   Of course in doing so we run the risk of pasting our own cultural idols onto the faith, but to not do this would be far worse.  I guess this is a form of the pruning Jesus talks about in John 15.  The postmodern culture is emerging and is changing.  It will become something else and at some point must cease to define itself by what it is not (modern) but rather by what it will be; as yet this is unknown.  What an opportunity!  If we can respond to the changes well enough why couldn't The Church take a part in deciding what the post-whatever becomes?  That is my dream.   (St Tommies, Richard's talk on Sunday 04 01 was a fantastic look at this side of things, exciting and empowering).  For me there are two more big challenges.  The first is a challenge to my attitudes best summed up by Paul in 1 Corinthians 13.  "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing."  One of the things that hit me from "A new kind of Christian was the humility and love McLaren had about the Church in every era.    It would be easy for me to become a noisy gong sounding off at the evils of modernism and so to become nothing but destructive.  I need to learn greater love for The Church, to watch my thoughts and be less rebellious.  The second is about action.  How easy it is to publicly tow a line and inwardly fume.  How easy it is to talk and dream and still do nothing.  I know that I need to step out further into experiments of post-modern kingdom living that are loving, creative, just and prophetic.  I want to do so with other people in conversation and action.    These are just stages in a thought process, I'm aware I haven't written anything new and that you may well be further along this line of thought than me.  Please come back at me and help me work these through in greater depth.

      Its been very good to be back, everyone I know who has done teaching says It's much easier after Christmas and I guess this week has been.  Most of my classes seem to have accepted me now and are a bit easier.  Most, but not all, still really struggling with one group.  But I think I'm winning there too.

      Since my birthday I've been given/bought a couple of music dvds- Never really thought of it before but now I can watch music as well as listen.  The first one was the  urlLink Zen TV DVD  - a lot of the videos have a distinctive future/retro feel about them.  Its got the Coldcut/Hextatic classics on it - Timber and Natural Rhythm.  I think my favorites are  the two Funki Porcini videos.   "What are You looking at" Starts very peaceful, with amazing close ups of flowers and then as the music gets a bit crazy/jazzy/prophetic.   A dandelion explodes you follow a single seed.  It was very powerful.   The other one"Atomic Kitchen" is just very clever and beautiful.  I also like the Kid Koala animated videos, one of them seems to involve a funeral procession turning into a carnival and the everyone floating off into the sky.  Reminded me a bit of " urlLink The Resurrection " by Stanley Spencer in that both allow spiritual beauty into the everyday  Ninja Tune has been stretching the boundaries of Music and Visuals for a while so its very cool to see it all here.  The other one was the Massive Attack 11 Promos DVD.  I've wanted it for a year or so.  Obviously the videos do have a much more mainstream feel then Ninja and there are lots of moody shots of various band members.  Several of the videos seem to involve extraordinary, real life.  My favorites are Protection (Tracy Thorn and the band in a block of flats.  Strange things going on now and again) and best of all Angel where Daddy G is chased by band members and others through a vast car park.  As the song reaches its end he is forced to confront his pursuers.  Amazing and victorious.  I was a bit down when I watched it last week and it helped me pray.

      Haven't ever blogged about -ahem- professional matters before but I was chatting with a couple of people about the proposal to (among other things) teach  urlLink Atheism in RE  last night and thought I'd put down some thoughts.  Personally I think its quite a good step for three reasons.  1.  I believe that education in the Humanities (including RE) is about widening pupils horizons,  allowing them to consider this amazing world and to draw out and consider differences and similarities between themselves and other people.  Therefore I welcome any widening that allows pupils to consider other view points.  2.  It seems to imply that Athieism and Humanism are Faith/Belief based worldviews like any other religion.  Doesn't this open up new avenues of conversation between "religion" and "humanism?"  3.  My Faith informed perspective has led me to have serious questions about the role of RE, and in particular the teaching of Christ, in Schools.  Schools remain places of Control.  The intention is that pupils are turned into good, hardworking, responsible and skillfull adults.  To achieve this I shout, I threaten pupils with sanctions if they do not listen.  I have to stop some forms of self-expression.  And then I try to tell them about a man who lived and died to preach love.   There seems to be an irony here.   I think we (Christians) have taken the teaching of religion in Schools for granted for too long.  I do not subscribe to the belief that Christianity has any moral right to be taught as the main religion in Schools.  That seems to me to be a hang-over from a time when Church and State were more closely merged.  That time is (happily) coming to an end.  It is The Church's job to teach Christ, it is not Schools.  Schools have a very different job and these proposals seem to reflect that. I am not saying there should not be RE.  I actually love teaching (and finding out about) world religions and discussing them with my pupils and of course the heritage and religious traditions of Christianity have as much right to be taught as any others.  But "my" Jesus lived on the fringes of acceptable society and was crucified because the political and religious authorities of the time were too challenge.  Can he be taught well in Schools by establishment figures like teachers?

      As its half term H has taken a couple of days off so we can spend them together.  Yesterday we went into Sheffield and had a bit of a walk round the city centre.  Our main aim was to look at some different art exhibitions there.  This was thwarted somewhat because we couldn’t find the Bloc Space and had forgotten the Site Gallery was closed on Mondays.  We did get to the Millennium Galleries, however, and looked round the  urlLink Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller exhibition  there.  This is the first large scale contemporary art show that the Millennium Galleries has done and is a fantastic start.  Cardiff and Miller work with Film and Sound to create exhibits that cleverly play with reality and narrative.  There are 5 works on display.  The first four use the conventions of cinema to examine the effects sound and image have on the audience.  I found them very playful and slightly disturbing.  There were moments when I was unsure what was “real” in the exhibition and what was not.        In the final piece, Forty Part Motet, Cardiff creates something almost transcendental that contrasts greatly with the other clever, cinematic pieces.  A 16th Century choral work, "Spem in Alium Numquam habui", by Thomas Tallis, is played over 40 speakers arranged around the room.  Each of the speakers represents a single voice in the choir.  The affect is awesome.  The sound of the choir creates a place of sanctuary that you get lost in and for me also it created a place of worship, a thin place.  The title of the choral piece means “I have never put my trust in anyone but you,” so led me to make obvious spiritual connections.  As I looked around the room I realised that it had much the same effect on everyone there.    After all that we had lunch in the Winter Gardens, man I love that place.

      THE VOICE OF CHRIST MY CHILD, I must be your supreme and last end, if you truly desire to be blessed. With this intention your affections, which are too often perversely inclined to self and to creatures, will be purified. For if you seek yourself in anything, you immediately fail interiorly and become dry of heart. Refer all things principally to Me, therefore, for it is I Who have given them all. Consider each thing as flowing from the highest good, and therefore to Me, as to their highest source, must all things be brought back. From Me the small and the great, the poor and the rich draw the water of life as from a living fountain, and they who serve Me willingly and freely shall receive grace upon grace. He who wishes to glory in things apart from Me, however, or to delight in some good as his own, shall not be grounded in true joy or gladdened in his heart, but shall be burdened and distressed in many ways. Hence you ought not to attribute any good to yourself or ascribe virtue to any man, but give all to God without Whom man has nothing. I have given all things. I will that all be returned to Me again, and I exact most strictly a return of thanks. This is the truth by which vainglory is put to flight. Where heavenly grace and true charity enter in, there neither envy nor narrowness of heart nor self-love will have place. Divine love conquers all and enlarges the powers of the soul. If you are truly wise, you will rejoice only in Me, because no one is good except God alone, Who is to be praised above all things and above all to be blessed. [From Imitation of Christ, Book 3, by Thomas a' Kempis]   This was on my newsreader from  urlLink Our Daily Blog   today and at the same time this was the  urlLink daily verse  that came through...  1 John 2:15-17 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world- -the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions--is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.   Both coming together made me sit up and take notice a bit more.

             "See! The winter is past;  the rains are over and gone.  Flowers appear on the earth;  the season of singing has come,  the cooing of doves  is heard in our land.  The fig tree forms its early fruit;  the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.  Arise, come, my darling;  my beautiful one, come with me."   Song of Solomon 2: 11-13  I am loving the promise of summer that is in the air right now.  Winter ending, spring coming, Lent draws towards Easter and with it comes the promise of new life, of resurrection.

      I'm being a bit cheeky and avoiding marking or planning by blogging at school.  But I've got break duty in a minute (at least its a nice day) so I thought I'd take a few minutes off in my day.  Went to the 24/7 Prayer room last night.  Its ace, they always looks really good after a few days when people have made it their own.  I know the big thing about  urlLink 24/7  is that it gets people praying more and all that but I got particularly excited about one of the by products yesterday.  Its so cool to have a place that's open for people to connect with God at any point.  Like a chapel or cathedral but where they can interact, set the agenda and worship in their way.  I love it!  I guess its a bit like a third place (check out  urlLink Small Ritual  for more on that).  So powerful.  Made me think - I'd love to have a place like that permanently (Maybe the Tom's chapel already is- but I know there will be locks and security issues anywhere) where people knew that if they went there they could access worship and church - a 24hr Chaplaincy/Chill out room.  Now if it could be wifi too, well I could get very carried away here...    Oops there's the break bell.  Better go onto the yard.  Extras added 1 day later  I've had this on my mind for a while now.  Airports and Shopping Centres have chaplaincies so they must work for people.   And I remember my favourite bit of the Millenium Dome was the big chill out bubble with lights and music.  Could we not do a similar thing.  Creative, safe, welcoming chapels in "Normal" Places?

      Spent most of yesterday at Philadelphia preparing for Profile, our clubbing meets social action night.  Had a lot of fun preparing for it with other people, a great way to spend a Saturday.  The night itself felt amazing.  The event felt like a little festival with loads of different stalls, activities and people.  Just wandering round the place I saw people doing their thing in groups, dancing, creating, campaigning, praying, juggling, talking.  Man what a buzz - now this is church!  The music itself was fantastic.  DJ Tambe kicked it all off in his own distinctive way, (nu-jazz/hip-hop/carnival beats), Andy H and MC Testament then upped the tempo with breaks and live hip-hop (including breakdancers and beatbox battle) before Matt finished us off with tasty new school breaks.    Action stuff included our own little sweatshop to sew together the bits of the  urlLink Speak  giant dress, a dance upon injustice playstation dance mat.  Letters, petitions and pledges on fair trade etc.  And a chance to make bracelets that reminded you to act justly.  Here is mine.       Perhaps the coolest thing for me was that loads of people stayed at the end to clear up the place.  We had to take down the all the decor including a large tent pavilion and chill out area and then put the chairs back into the worship area.  But we were really blessed by so many helpers.  Thanks guys.  Dave, Tim and Simon, thanks so much for making this happen, it was amazing.  St Toms and Connect thanks for letting us try this out. And God thanks for being there and bringing it all together.  Now help us to live out the things we talked, wrote, danced and prayed about.  Photos will follow soon...

      There are several things that God seems to be challenging me to do right now, so for my own good I will record them here (I will use the second person but only because I am addressing myself.  Do not think, dear reader, that I am trying to preach at you).  Make space in your life to connect with your God and follow your dreams.  Do not allow yourself to be completely sucked in to doing things for money, security or recognition.  Connect with others on journeys.  Make friends, let them help you when you fall, help them when they do.  Stop trying to do things alone  Live the way you talk, and talk about the things you dream of doing.  Seek truth and accept it when you find it.  You don't have to question everything.  Shun cynicism, it is heart-death.  Fight; you are in a battle so do not give in but remember you are not fighting people.  On the whole you are fighting for them.

      Connect on Saturday night was amazing.  D3 are a group looking at mission to club culture so their take on church was informed by that.  Worship was DJ/VJ based with a few well selected tracks providing the sonic background.  There was no "worship leader" as such but instead a loose liturgy of images and words led us this made it feel beautifully decentralized and yet there was a definite process or journey made.  I Personally found it so liberating to be able to go a bit wild with the dancing again.  Powerful.  The guys also prepared some very thought provoking prayer stations some of the negative attitudes about club culture.  After the celebration of beats and visuals in worship it was very useful then to dwell on the "darker" side of the rave generation lifestyle (drugs, sex etc.) and gave the evening a bit of balance. It was also a great chance to pray.    The Alter piece for the evening was superb.  A couple of decks and a few empty bottles,  I loved the symbolism of it.  Celebrating something and sacrificing it at the same time.  Took a couple of pictures and I'll put it all up here if they're any good.  The whole thing got me thinking about something that's been bubbling over for a while in my mind.  That is the theology of cut and paste (WARNING - Potential pretentiousness coming up.  Sensitive types may want to avoid).  OK, here goes.  A good DJ or VJ samples and images from loads of different sources - often stuff that has been disregarded or lost up until that point as well as the current cool tracks videos or whatever.  Then through their work on the decks or the whatever it is VJs use (maybe this goes for found object art, blogging and other stuff too) they reinvigorate them, turn them into celebration into music, into dance.  Thus the discarded, the mundane and the "top ten for this week forgotten tomorrow single" all take on new life to set the dancefloor alive.        Now, doesn't Ezekiel talk about Dry Bones hearing the word of God and taking on new life?  So couldn't the hands on the decks become more than just a DJ.  Couldn't they become prophetic acts, symbols of the work of God?    Just an undeveloped thought from a non-djing, non-theologian-  may come back to it in the future.  (btw- my listening during that last post was the superb new Album " urlLink Ten " by cLOUDDEAD, They're a trio making US, White-Boy, Electronica-Hip Hop.  This is (I think) their second album.  Haven't got it yet, just listening to it on the  urlLink Ninja Tune  website.  Bit like DJ Shadow, The Beta Band, Beck and Boards of Canada jamming together, but better.  Very memerising and beautiful stuff.  I may have to make a purchase soon.)

      Had a pretty nice day at School, several of my classes were good fun today, was able to relax and be a bit human with the kids.  They seemed to pick up on it too.  "What's the matter with you sir, you seem happy."  In fact this week's been pretty good School wise, so thanks God.  Really looking forward to this weekend.  H and I are doing the Mission Order Induction Weekend AND there's Connect on Saturday Night.  D3 are doing it and Dave was talking it up last time we spoke.  So, anticipation grows...

      The lack of posts is mainly due, once again, to just so much real life!  lots going on- so here's a quick run down.  ready...  Expression:  Helen and I are leaving Expression (St Thomas' Student Church) very soon, it just feels like God is calling us on to something different.  Hopefully it'll be somewhere where we experiment with the things we've been thinking and talking about on these blogs.  First was the Expression Ball and then Sat and Sun H was organizing a Girls night and a brunch and it felt like this was really our last weekend of Expression stuff.  I guess for me its both exciting and a wrench.  I hadn't realized how much of my identity I get from being in Expression and helping lead it.  Feels like a big deal for us moving on... But we're excited.   Expression Ball was Excellent by the way.  School:  Is tough.  I've just been finding it very hard getting through to the kids.  There seems to be so much I have to do by way of control that is a bit beyond me and I can't do the teaching I had wanted too.  That said, there are moments of sunshine.  Like when kids seem to choose to come and talk to you about whatever.  Or when a lesson seems to go well and you can see you have helped kids learn something.    Connect:  As we leave Expression we reckon we're heading towards Connect  and discovering lots of people there that think like us.  Its been a lot of fun getting to know them all.  Connect feels like a home for us already.  Thanks.  Money:  We've been in a bit of a story on this.  God seems to have said some stuff to us about giving and receiving and we acted on it expecting everything to go hunkydory.  I guess it did but not all in the way we had planned.  So we ended up getting nasty letters from the bank and other people.  We seem to be emerging from this little episode now and I think God is teaching us about Sacrifice, Faith and Taking Responsibility.  Profile:  Is coming up soon, its a kind of clubbing meets justice night at the Philadelphia Campus in Sheffield on 20th March.  Its being organized by Spikey Tim,  urlLink D3  Dave and Simon Ennis and is going to be way cool.  I'm playing around with planning decor and stuff for it (email me if you want to help) and am well excited, its going to be huge.  Other stuff happening too, but I think that's all that is public domain.  The sea feels very big and my boat feels very small.

      I read this poem in New Internationalist (great mag - go buy it)  I don't understand it all but it kind of resonated with me. Even though it comes from a very different culture and situation to mine I think I heard the voice of God in it.  Create create create in mind create in muscle create in nerve create in man create in masses create create with dry eyes create create over the profanation of the forest over the brazen fortress of the whip create over the perfume of sawn trunks create create with dry eyes create create bursts of laughter over the derision of the palmatoria courage in the tips of the planters boots  strength in the splintering of battered-in doors firmness in the red blood of insecurity create create with dry eyes create create stars over the warriors sledgehammer peace over children's weeping peace over sweat  over the tears of contract labour peae over hatred create create peace with dry eyes create create create freedom in the slave stars manacles of love on the paganized paths of love festive sounds over the swinging bodies on the simulated gallows  Create  create love with dry eyes.  Agostinho Neto, Angola 'Create' from Sacred Hope by Agostinho Neto, Tanzania Publishing House  (about Agostinho Neto NI writes "The NI described Agostinho Neto as the quintessential example of the poet as revolutionary, spinning his dreams and inspirational calls to arms from inside prison cells and given the chance to turn imagination to reallity as the first President of independent Angola")

         I have enjoyed catching up on the recent conversations about worship.  I share many of  urlLink Andy 's frustrations and feel very strongly that there is much to worship that we (in the generalist of meanings - we humans, not anything smaller) have not explored for ages.  For a long time I was in what seems to be Andy's place.  Sung worship just left me completely cold and the fact that everyone else seemed so keen on hours of it really grated. Then I also realised that it was about a sacrifice to God and not my feelings.  Then I had guilt as well as frustration.  Great.  But God gives grace to the guiltily frustrated and I've kind of been on a journey with worship for a while.  May I offer a few musings.  But first let me say that I find myself agreeing with most of the things  urlLink Andy  and  urlLink Matt  have already said (as is often the case).   moving   I think worship is intended to be participative and active.  I'm sure this is supposed to also be the case with singing songs.  After all you sing words that you're mind engages with.  But for me it often just doesn't work. I find singing to be quite passive, perhaps partly because I'm not overconfident about my voice but also cos your not doing much.  You sit or stand you sing, the music happens to you.  So I have been looking for more active ways of worshipping both corporately and privately.   dancing   One is dancing.  This I'm sure isn't the way for all guys (but it was for King David) and is partly because I was so into dance music when younger.  I find that when I am swinging my arms and legs around like a crazed gibbon my whole body is able to focus on the father.  It also becomes a bit of a sacrifice because you look a bit silly.   kneeling   The other is posture.  Kneeling, Prostrating myself, raising my hands etc.  For a while I was a bit suspicious of them - but that's another story.  But I have more recently realised that they help me focus.  I do something with my body and it helps me focus.  So a song can have more meaning if my hands are raised.  Strange but true.   singing   I have also come to acknowledge that maybe the rest of Christendom may not be completely wrong about songs and guitars.  Singing has always been a way of communicating stories.  We are all obsessed at some level or another with Pop and the stories communicated there, just look at the number of us that quote songs on our blogs.  Worship songs our a great way of telling our story to ourselves, to each other and to God.  Now I do feel there can be an issue with the quality of musical backing to the story and the range of emotion imagery we use (where are the nu - metal worship songs of sacrifice and raging against injustice for example).  But that doesn't mean we should chuck singing out (though I'm sure you don't mean that Andy.  One form of song that has been very helpful to me is the Taize style chant.  Simple yet deep words that you can play with, harmonise with and again be more engaged in.   creating   One of the things I love about the alternative worship movement is its focus on creativity and activity.  We are beginning to explore this in prayer stations at St Tom's.  Worship through making something, doing something reacting to something.  Again it helps me to engage with my maker.   In co-creating we meet God in his role as creator and we use some of the attributes that make us like him. Now I like that.   being (and ritual)   Our whole life is worship.  We often say it and yet I often miss this out.  One of the most helpful things I've found in my personal devotion life is best described as ritual.  Rituals can be like litual spiritual portals that remind you that you are in the presence of the almighty.  Maybe it could just be crossing myself and saying a short prayer before doing something I enjoy.  Or associating brushing my teeth with confession.  Or repeating a short prayer ('Jesus son of God, have mercy on me a sinner', for example) as I do something (cooking for example).  They are not magic but they do remind me that the normal stuff I do can be and should be worship.  A great place to start on this stuff is the  urlLink ReJesus Spirituality pages .   pushing forward   I think we (human beings again, nothing else) often have a tendency to err towards conservatism.  We stick with what works for us, maybe in Churches we call it God's plan or whatever.  Now that's fine in many ways.  Maybe the frustration some of us feel is God's call to move out in our explorations of worship.  We have an eternal infinite God and so it stands to reason that there is a deep ocean of ways to engage with him.  Maybe we get a little too stuck in what we think is the way to do it.  Maybe we need to venture out a bit.  that's a very big post and it does not even begin to say all I want.  I might follow it up in the future.   As well as the ReJesus site I mentioned earlier.  Jonny Baker's  urlLink site  has some great stuff - particularly the  urlLink worship tricks  about engaging in different ways.    Post script .  Anyone interested in meeting up for real life experiments in pushing out worship?  Been thinking about it for a while - if you are please let me know.

      Don't you hate it when you realise your not as sorted as you thought?  I stayed away from Heidi Baker on Monday.  I used my work at school (parents evening the day after) as an excuse but really I was just too scared.  The thing was that I couldn't face being in a room again where everyone else was being got by God and nothing was happening to me.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diss on St. Tom's or Heidi or The Holy Spirit but rather a confession.  I couldn't deal with having to smile and laugh along with people who were affected in a way I've never understood cog I've rarely experienced.  I wasn't prepared to run the risk of feeling inadequate because I'm still standing still and rehearsing excuses in my head; its happened to many times before.  And I don't have a problem with any of this stuff happening.  I know its God's power moving on us.  In my head I agree with  urlLink Matt  and  urlLink Ruth 's comments about it all recently.  But still I stayed away.   I thought I had got past this by now, I was sure that I was secure enough in God to allow him to challenge me like this, apparently not. So I guess like Israel at Sinai I let my insecurities get in the way of a powerful experience of God.    I don't want to be in the way of what you're doing God  I want to grow God. I want to change. I want to risk.  Have mercy on me.  (I'm really not sure whether this is something I should or want to post, its kinda personal confessionally.  But a part of me wants to make this weakness public so I might risk it.  Please come back to me if I overstep any lines).

      took some of my y10s to Manchester yesterday.  The day was a lot of fun, except for the bit where some of our girls seemed intent on picking a fight with some exchange students from France.    We went to Old Trafford first and then on to the  urlLink Imperial War Museum North .  I'm not really a sport follower (too tall and clumsy at School to ever be good enough at it to enjoy watching it), but I think going to the  urlLink Man U  ground helped me finally understand the sport/religion connection. Old Trafford is for sure a place of worship.  Thousands of seats all focused on the "hallowed turf" and Icons of Man U, players and sponsors everywhere.  I found the whole set up both awe inspiring and challenging.    The Imperial War Museum was excellent.  It seemed to me to be part museum and part memorial.  I enjoyed the building design a lot.  Where the other IW museums tend to glorify war a little this place did not.  But was intent on focusing on how it affects our individual stories.  There was an amazing presentation at the beginning of the affect of war on Children.  In an older museum this would be on a big screen at the front.  But here it was split up on a load of screens with different images and testimonies.  The presentation was projected across the whole museum so you got it going across tanks and harrier jump jets as well as bare walls.  Very moving.  The whole museum felt very -ahem- postmodern and seemed to be grappling with some of the same issues of presentation and contextualisation as the alt/emerging church.  Manchester also has  urlLink URBIS , which is another attempt to rethink museums a bit.    Who says London has all the fun?

      I've just finished reading  urlLink Brian McLaren 's book  urlLink The story we find ourselves in  which is the sequel to A new kind of Christian.    The book tackles, among other things, with the biblical story of God's love, but in a way different to anything I'd read or understood before.  It all takes place against a background of personal and public tragedy and several journeys towards faith.  The book answers some of the questions from A new kind... But also opens up many more.  I found that it made me cry and gave me hope.  We're just coming out of Easter and moving towards Ascension and Pentecost right now.  The particular stories are pretty famous but some of them have been new and fresh to me this year.    I can imagine being one of the crowd on Palm Sunday cheering this prophet but not sure why.  I can feel the faint hope that maybe this is it.  Maybe this could be the one we've been promised. Maybe soon the war, the occupation that night will be over.  I can see myself in that crowd watching Jesus in the week, the confusion at some of the things he is saying and doing.  The fear of this dynamic and dangerous man.  I can understand the sudden dread among the disciples on the Thursday when Jesus talks about death and is then arrested.  Why doesn't he do something?  Why is this happening.  And then the utter despair on the Friday as all the hopes, all the dreams I had are killed with my friend on the cross.  The darkness, the betrayal.  Like God has let us down.  Its the end that is the hardest to empathise with.  We know it ended we've read it and seen it.  We have also read all the fairy tales and fantasies that talk about the good guy winning.  But can I imagine what it might have been like to actually be at the resurrection?  To hear in the pit of despair that some of the group were losing it.  That believed they'd seen Jesus again.  And then to feel the faintest of hopes as more and more people said the same.  What would it do to my world?  That he could have won by dying.  That he might be alive?    Man I'd be scared.   Its fun to imagine being in that context.  Living the story for the first time.  But how does it affect me today, how do I live out the story today.  As a husband, a teacher and a friend?

      I heard this song on Jo Whiley's show driving home for Easter; it made be double take.   Isn't it a great confession.     "Breathe Me  Help I have done it again I have been here many times before Hurt myself again today And the worst the worst part is there's no one else to blame  be my friend hold Me, wrap me up unfold me, I am small and needy warm me up and breathe me  Ouch I have lost myself against Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found yeah I think that I might break lost myself again, i feel unsafe  be my friend hold Me, wrap me up unfold me, I am small and needy warm me up and breathe me"  Today I bought the whole  urlLink Sia  album.   Its very good, most of the songs are about love or heartbreak (so that some reviewers dismissed it as a heartbreak album when it came out in march) and can be melancholy.  But theres a lot of hope in there too, and forgiveness.    Sia's voice is amazing and gives the whole album an intimate feel.  The beats and music are very interesting too, not just a vehicle for the Songs.  Sia has done some songs with Zero 7 but I reckon her own music is better.

      I've been reading a few tips from  urlLink Living Room   about  Blogging for lasting change   On the one hand it gives some great practical hints on how to make blogs more readable and accessible.    Its also got me thinking about my blogging activities and in particular  What do I blog for?   I know I started as an extension of my journal but since then have developed.  I want to comment on the things I see around me.  I want to add my voice to certain conversations and I want my site to be part of God's mission so I guess I do want readers to be affected.  All very grandiose stuff and I'm sure I miss the mark a bit.  But I have a quote on my dining room wall. "Hold on to your dreams, for if dreams die life is a broken winged bid that cannot fly" (Shakespeare, I think.  Well its definitely not the bible but it sounds oldish), Better to have a dream than not; so here's my question.   What do you blog for?

      I think I more or less agree with the direction  urlLink Matt's  going in about Pluralism, Brian McClaren and CS Lewis (I think Being found by God is probably a better description).  I'm getting quite wary about limiting God's ability to find and save people.   I've heard it and said it before (so much so that its almost a cliche) but I do think the key is to find what God's doing and get along side it, not prescribe what we believe God should be doing and refuse to accept anything else.    urlLink Jonny Baker  has found some more excellent flash animations.  The  urlLink Ni9e  site is amzing.  Well worth just exploring at leisure.  I loved the typographic illustrations and  urlLink starfish  the most.  The  urlLink 24/7 Lords Prayer  is very powerful too.  The new issue of  urlLink emerginchurch.info  is very good.  It includes  urlLink Jonathan's  post asking the emerging west to broaden their horizons a little and two non-western stories by way of response.  Very inspiring, very challenging.  I loved  urlLink Andrew Jone's  poem,  urlLink sTorm  and like the new site design too.  I've just seen that he's coming to Sheffield soon too.  Can anyone enlightne me a bit about this visit?  Thanks  urlLink Andy  for the link to  urlLink ChavScum .  It made me laugh a lot although I was a little concerned about the levels of hate found there. Can see some of my kids going that way!  Enjoyed  urlLink Dave's  stories about D3, Profile and 24/7 a lot too.  Mate, its so cool watching your life right now.  I've been admiring from afar the  urlLink Grace Lent Blog .  Only one more week to go!

         Here's the Alter Piece from Connect last month; I blogged about it then.  I love the symbolism of it and the way it plays with the idea of communion.  What's great about connect is the way its different people doing it each month, it gives it a different flavour and expression of Church.  I think its Inspire tonight and as its leant I'm sure it'll be interesting.

      Greetings from Rome!  We are with Marco, Cinzia, Luca and Debora.  The weather is beautiful, the food is, well - Italian and we are having a blast.  Seems like we're sure having to suffer a lot for this mission trip (not)!  So far we have been meeting with people at the University and in different squares and listening to their stories, sharing ours.  Marco and Luca are planting a church here so we are kinda working towards that.  Sunday night was particularly cool.  We joined them for their church.  Anglo-Italian bilingual worship and then a translated preach and food.  It was very low key and beautiful.    Tomorrow we have a day off so we shall hit Rome's sights.  Our internet was down when we left sheffield but I will post photos as soon as I get back and can sort it.

      The reason for the 2 weeks silence?  Reports.  7 class sets to prepare, all finally done and handed in today.   A great weight is lifted off and now I have time for exciting stuff like blogging etc.  Except that it might remain quiet for a week more because we're off to Rome on mission (hooray).  We are staying with Marco and Cinzia.  I'm very excited.

      Helen and I are leading a team of TTs/Formees on Mission to Rome in 2 weeks (tough one I know).  We will be hooking up with Marco and Cinzia and spending a week supporting them and helping out.  As neither us or our team have the money to pay for this trip we decided to raise as much of it as possible through a sponsored silence.  Helen and the TTs will be keeping quiet from Sun Up to Sun down (or thereabouts) this Tuesday.  I Shall not; silence and teaching do not really mix.  If you know us and would like to sponsor Helen then please get in touch.  Thank you.

      These are 2 things I wrote for our small group.  They both use the idea of Hands.  The first is a meditation and the second is intended to be an action prayer.  You clench and close fists at appropriate points.   Hands   Take a moment to admire your hands.   Look at them as a feat of engineering. Move your fingers, let them open and close, enjoy the motion of muscles and the folding of skin.  Look at the patterns held in your palm.   Survey the lines and wrinkles that have marked you so far. Trace the outlines of veins and arteries that carry life giving blood below he surface.  See the prints on the tips of your fingers.  Follow them down the rest of your hand. They are like contours on a map or rings on a tree,   This is your unique picture. A pattern that God has made for you and you only.   The Bible calls us fearfully and wonderfully made; Can you see evidence for that in your hands? Think about their ability to move, to sense, and to shape. These are tools and artworks Formed by the one who set their stars in their place. And they are yours. No-one has a pair like these, they're one of a kind.  Our hands show the greatness of our creator and our significance to him.  Often it is our hands that show what it is to be God breathed. With these hands we create, we write, we cook, play and work. As we do each of these we exercise our role as little Gods,  reflections of his Glory, his greatness, his creativity.  Can you see the signs of toil on your hands? Cuts, Scars and Callouses all show us that this world is hard. They remind us that we're not yet home. We strive, we suffer, we fall.  How have you used these works of wonder today? Have you created or destroyed?  Fed or taken?  Greeted or turned away? Have your hands been part of his story, or part of another?  Imagine your hands held in another's. These are bigger, more capable, and stronger. These hands set planets in motion and shape each new life.  Yet they are also scarred and worn. They bear the piercings of love and the marks of death.  As well as the power of resurrection. Allow these hands to enfold your own.  Let your hands be taken and held by his.   Clenched Fists   As we clench our fists we remember that we are stubborn and resistant to you. We seek to go our own way and often rebel.  And so we open our hands to ask for forgiveness, To release our own plans, and to surrender our will.  As we clench our fists we recognize our potential for anger. To fight, to scare. We can be part of the mob and as we clamour for justice, for rightness, for revenge we can easily destroy your world.  So we open our hands to show our weakness. We are small and vulnerable We cannot carry grudges We have no score to settle.  As we clench our fists we remember the times we have refused to give. We have turned away strangers, We have denied aid and sort to keep your blessings to ourselves.  So we open our hands to give and receive. To accept your gifts and pass them on. To welcome neighbours and to be channels of your grace.  As we clench our fists we recognize our tendency to fight our corner To go it alone and to bash out a way. “Its us against the world”, we say as we try to succeed through strength.  So we open our hands to let go. We give our struggles to you. We receive you're cool balm.  Holy spirit anoint our hands,  Heal our wounds, Give us your power. And let our hands work, together, for you.

      Just been to The (new look)  urlLink Ooze .  Very impressive.  I particularly like the  urlLink collaborative blog .   urlLink emerging church info  has an axcellent article about  urlLink Network Church  by  urlLink steve collins .  urlLink  The Dark  is soundcape built in complete darkness.  It looks  at the the hidden history of slave trade in this country and uses the imagery of ghosts to talk about past injustices.  It is interesting to on many levels, the history stuff of course, the way it uses new technology to tell old stories, the justice side and the way sound and (the lack of light) can be used to shape reality.  See all that and I haven't even visited it yet.  There is an  urlLink online version  (broadband required) but even better it is coming to  urlLink Magna  in Rotherham May 14th - August 27th.

      "Yes!" I thought as I picked out the free CD from yesterday's guardian.  "A sampler of Some of Electronica's finest.  I shall pass this to  urlLink Si  and then he will have to admit that I am right."  But 4 tracks in I wasn't so sure.  A lot of it was, in Si's words "empty, vacant and souless".  I think the reason has to do with restraint.  The tracks that were succesful were those that gave space.  Some tried to squeeze too much in and so managed to squeeze the beauty out.  At its best, dance music that came after acid house can convey emotions and tell stories as well as any other.  But it's too easy to make electronica bad by putting in too much.  Too many sounds, to many influences, to little restraint.  I was reminded of this as I watched  urlLink Basement Jaxx  on TV last night.  Sure they got the Glastonbury crowd going but for me there was just little too much going on.  Maybe one or two ideas less in each song and there would be something more powerful said.  That is why I mark the passing of  urlLink Orbital  who play their last gig at Glastonbury tonight.  Theirs was dignified, dance music that would move your feet but could also tell stories.  They had ideas and ambition, but not in excess.  On the whole they avoided the temptation of overcrowding their work.  THe Guardian CD showed this.  Their tracks, especially Chime and Belfast towered over the others.

      My friend Graham and I went out for breakfast today at the rather excellent Cafe in the Park.  Afterwards we walked out along the Porter Brook for a little and found the  urlLink Shepherd's Wheel.  The wheel is a water-powered grinding wheel in operation from the 1500s to the 1930s.  It was typical of a number of early industrial sites from around Sheffield.  During the 18th Century the Wheel employed 10 or so cutlery grinders along with apprentices who would polished the cutlery and learn from the grindsmen with them.  We were told that many of the workers were related and would bring their families to the site.   urlLink     urlLink     The wheel was built from local materials and was entirely reliant on the environment around it.  Power came from the Porter Brook and the workers were warmed by wood from the forest.  Stone for the building and the wheels would come from nearby Derbyshire.  When it was built England was transitioning from subsitance work to more industrialised, less sustainable ways of production.  For 400 years cultery grinders worked there until the mill was moved in the 1930s.   urlLink     urlLink     There were a number of such wheels along the Porter and other Rivers in Sheffield.  It was these small scale, family sized, operations that helped transform this area from a collection of towns and villages into the powerful industrial city it became.  These few grinders in their small, sustainable, mill transformed a city.  I found the site fascinating in itself but also saw parallels with the story I'm part of.  It reminded me of the kind of  urlLink small, creative, mission communities  some of us are participating in.  Little communities, close to the culture and driven by God's spirit.  Maybe in we could change our communities too.  After all, the mission of Christ began with 12.  The site is run by  urlLink Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust , they are trying to raise money to get it operational again.  It is open the last Sunday of every month until October.

      just to be clear.  That's Pomo, not Porno in my profile - I've been getting the virtual equivalent of strange looks.  So let me explain.  Pomo is shorthand for  urlLink Postmodern .  The longer word in annoying, clumsy and heaped with different ideas and interpretations.  The shorter is just the same, but hopefully just a little more playful.  I identify myself as a Pomo Pilgrim because it seems like an appropriate statement of intent.  Postmodern is what I am and where I come from.  A lot of what we accept as Christianity has been drafted within an old cultural context best known as Modernism.  That means that at best some of it isn't too useful and at worst it is idolatrous.  It also means that the label Christian means lots of things to lots of people, and not all of them are the most helpful.  I choose to identify myself as postmodern to show that I am eager to seek Christ in our new cultural context. I call myself a pilgrim because I am on a journey.  I am travelling towards Christ.  This blog is mainly to tell chapters of that story.  I hope that makes sense.  I know it all sounds pretentious, thats the problem with paradigm shifts! ;-)

       urlLink The Streets - A grand don't come for free .  An amazingly ambitious and inventive record that tells a number of different stories.  Mike Skinner records the experiences of Suburban youth in way that brings laughs and tears.   urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  - I love  urlLink Charlie Kaufman  movies and this was his best.  Where  urlLink Spike Jonze  took him off into wiered wacky and warped territory very well  urlLink  Michel Gondry  uses Kaufman's quirkiness to tell a beautiful love story.   urlLink Mystic River  - Not sure enjoy is the best world.  I watched this with Helen yesterday and became immersed in it.  An epic of friendship, betrayal and tragedy that completely draws you in with its twists and turns.  It felt a lot like an old western which isn't surprising given its director.   urlLink Chatiryworld  - A very well designed blog by Helen's cousin Katherine.  I really like the way her blog reads, I guess that means she has a good writing style.  And she makes me laugh and think.   urlLink Four Tet - As serious as you like  (video) - Makes the link between electronica and  urlLink Morris Dancing !

      Once again I am unable to contain my thoughts about  urlLink Si 's blog.  This time though he needs correcting - its a dirty job but someone's got to do it.  Its not often that you even verge on minor heresy Si, but I'm afraid you're comments on the  urlLink Observer 100 Best British Albums  are just completely wrong.  About the Stone Roses and the 90s and Doves (But your right about the Smiths).    I think I can understand the root of your error.  Being a good, real music man you may have missed the last great revolution of Modern Music - Acid House.  Stop your snickering for a minute, what Rave did was blow open the doors in a similar way to punk 10 years before.  It taught people how to actually use those digital machines from the 80s you mentioned.  Suddenly music was not just about what it did to your heart and head any more.  It was also about the reactions in your feet, what got you dancing.  So anything went as long as it felt good, and that got you moving.  This approach did not always work (rave sesame street anyone?) but at its best it led to new and glorious fusions.  Through rave the boundaries between rock, dance, jazz etc. seemed to fall.  Glorious Fusion ruled the day and sadly we that we seem to be moving towards greater polarisation again.  That was my major issue with the poll, I don't want to sound like a boring armchair raver but where was the techno?  Some of the most exciting albums made in the last 15 years were from unassuming blokes hiding behind banks of machines.  Leftfield, Chemical Brothers, The Orb, Goldie, all these people made albums that fused jazz, hip hop and rock together in new and exciting ways.  I know dance music is not as it was, but these people changed the music landscape.    As far as bands and indie were concerned, The best bands of the nineties were the ones were those that embraced this new approach and allowed it to take them in new directions.  That was what was great about the Roses; They got the (ahem) groove.  You could dance to them as well as get in to their solos or clever words.  You couldn't do that with the Smiths (although New Order you could.)  Later others, Primal Scream, The Orb, Spiritualized and others followed suit.  That's why your wrong to judge the nineties on a few pouting brit-pop bands. Admittedly there was a lot of high profile awfulness but isn't that just because more music was produced.  ThSo my advice is avoid the majority of over rated britpop and get into some of the gems of the new hybrid age.  With that in mind here are a good starters for the "other" Nineties and Noughties.  There are amazing Massive Attack, Tricky, Porstishead, Primal Scream, Streets and My Bloody Valentine Albums on the list but 2 other albums that the Observer missed are...   urlLink Spiritualized - Ladies and Gentlemen we are Floating in Space  Ambient, trance rock.  Took 5 years for Jason Spaceman to mix it and is his finest moment.  Angry, Passionate, Heartbreaking and Beautiful.   urlLink Leftfield - Leftism   The Dance album.  Leftield plus collaborators show that dance music can move your head and your brain.  Punk, Dub, Hip Hop and Techno fuse together to make a truly multi-cultural, British, Rock and Roll album.  I reckon the observer could have knocked off a couple of Beatles albums for those two.  Others that might not get into the Top 100 of all time but are some of my favourite all timers and might be of interest to those wanting to see beyond the brit pop and guitars:   urlLink Underworld - Second Toughest in the Infants      urlLink Chemical Brothers - Dig Your Own Hole    urlLink Cinematic Orchestra - Every Day      urlLink Four Tet - Rounds    urlLink Roots Manuva - Brand New Second Hand      urlLink 4 Hero - Creating Patterns    urlLink Asian Dub Foundation - Community Music     urlLink  Boards of Canada - Music Has the right to Children    urlLink Rae and Christian - Northern Sulphuric Soul      urlLink Nitin Sawney - Beyond Skin

      So, Monday has been and gone and the glass in my room is intact.  We had an awesome weekend at Stu and Emma's wedding.  One of the great things about my inlaws is that they really know how to throw a party.  The service was in the same H and I were married it.  It had nice mix of tradition and the tastes of Em and Stu showing through. Helen was bridesmaid and looked beautiful.     The reception was at a Tudor Barn.  Good food and drink, great company, fine speeches and a mid nineties nostalgia disco.  Superb!  It was so cool to celebrate with them.  Man, Stu's in my family!    Congratulations guys.  Individually you rock, together you'll be unstoppable!  (Photos coming, I promise).

      Spent the weekend with Helen and the Tribal Trainees (Formees?) on their retreat/party weekend.  The first part was silent retreat so I spent the afternoon sitting on a tree stump in the middle of Norfolk in the sun; beautiful.  I got well in to the retreat thing. After a week at school the day of silence was like a long cool drink.  Saturday Evening we found ourselves in the local pub for Kareoke.  I say pub but it felt a bit more like a youth club with beer ( due to the locals, not anyone we took along).  Great musical turns by Nick and Martin though, nice work guys.

      Just got my photos back from our week in Rome, so I thought it might be a good time to set down some reflections on our time there.      urlLink      24/7 Mission   I think the trip helped me understand what it means to live a missionary lifestyle.  Marco, Cinzia, Luca and Debora seem to have allowed the call to mission to permeate everything they do.  So something as small as a trip on the Metro is an opportunity to speak to people and make conversations.  These guys just don't stop.  Luca took a few of use to the new Games Workshop one evening.  He had started playing Lord of the Rings games simply as a chance to build up links and relationships.  Now I talk about that kind of thing; but doing it is very different.  Before, I used to pray for opportunities to share God's love.  Now I'm just desperate for courage to go with the ones that come up every minute of the day.     God's kingdom grows in strange places.   One of the coolest things we did is visit a refugee/asylum seekers camp on the outskirts of Rome.  It was a hard, poor place and people had very little.  Some of the houses were just shacks.  But at the centre of this community was a Church that looked well cared for and growing.  God's kingdom was at work there, on the fringes of society and people were responsive to him.     Talking to strangers isn't so bad   If you do it in the right way.  Asking questions, showing interest in peoples lives, finding out what they believe is actually quite good fun. I don't think there was a single English speaking person I talked to that was not happy to share their beliefs with me.  I left feeling that the best times I had were when it had been a conversation rather than a sermon.  The sharing and challenging should be 2 way, not just one.    We just need obedience, God strength is enough for the rest.    Yeah, it sounds like a big cliche but this is what I learnt most of all.  We can have big plans and schemes, or we can have nothing at all, it doesn't really matter.  Its doing what God says that is the key.  The guys in Italy and trying to plant emerging generation church and it is growing.  But along the way God's called them to do other stuff as well.  We were in the refugee camp simply because Marco had felt called there and so had gone and built up strong friendships.  God can mess up our plans and ideas.  But its probably better to let him do that.  As a team, I think the days we saw the most happen were those that we were most tired and frazzled.  Not because tired a frazzled is good, but because we had to just wing it on God - and he showed up.  That is what has been the biggest encouragement and challenge to me coming home.  To not try to rely on my own abilities but instead rely on God's grace, cos that is enough.

      This started as a comment on  urlLink Si 's blog, but then got bigger, so rather than clog Haloscan I'll put it here.  Thanks for sharing Si, generally I don't think we remember the past enough (but then I'm a history teacher).  We in the safe sanitized west don't see the effects of war in our lives, just on the TV - so its more important than ever to meditate on the loss and sacrifice of Mother's sons that world over.  What bowls me over is the idea of being a young man in the D Day type situation and putting so much at risk for dreams, aims and hopes that are not necessarily my own.  I spent much of last night watching Platoon cos I'm teaching Vietnam to Y10.   It amazed me how youth, idealism and innocence were so readily sacrificed.    What scares me the most is how soldiers on any side of conflict can so easily become dehumanized.  Become Grunts, Bodies, Casualties or resources.  We put distance between them and ourselves, and so take a step towards atrocities.  That said, there is an argument that says that ours is the least fit, least able, most disaffected generation in a while, and its also a generation that hasn't seen mass conflict or conscription.  I tend to have anti war leanings but can't help wandering if there is a connection.  I think it could be because war is in a way awesome.  It forces people to become part of something bigger than themselves.  Of course the bigger is destruction and pain, but it still forces people to transcend, isn't that why we remain so fascinated by it?  Because we all long to be more than ourselves.  On a simliar note,  urlLink this site  is very moving.  It's a collection of personal a stories about D Day from those who were there.  Useful for those of us who want to know and remember.

        urlLink     On Tuesday we got to go to the Sistine Chapel. It was a pretty cool to see the famous ceiling first hand. At the centre of it is an image that has been seen, copied and sent up so many times before. Nevertheless, the picture retains its power. It is the central point of our story; God reaching out to man. Like our lives the centre of Rome was very busy. Many things clamoured for our attention, ancient sites, cafes, shops, people but in the middle of it God reaches out and touches us. The challange to us there was this, do we allow ourselves time to see God reaching, do we respond? Or do we just get distracted by the noise and the sites. I guess that's a challenge we share here too.

      Spent the last few days at Church sorting out things for the streetreach prayer room.    I'm pretty excited about the whole mission thig next week.  Teams will be going out into the areas around our Church to do Gardening, Litter Picking, Kids Work and other stuff.  At the same time we are running a  urlLink 24-7  style Prayer Chapel for people to plug into.    My hope is that the Prayer rooms will become a kind of collaborative creative experiment in prayer and worship.  For people to come on their own terms and use the environment to engage with God during the mission weeks.  Their open 9-4.30 Mon-Friday throughout August at Philadelphia

      For a while I have wanted to push the limits of what I use this blog for.  So I'll be starting some occasional serial posts.  They'll all be linked up in my sidebar.  The first 2 are fairly basic:   Singing Aloud:   These are my Psalms.  Songs that I've found and adopted in my worship and devotion.  You, dear reader, only get the words.   Liturgy:   Prayers, Meditations, Poems etc. that I have written or nicked.  Some I've used on my own, some have been used in events.  I just want to store them somewhere.  If anything is of any use to you feel free to take it.

       urlLink BLESS THIS HOUSE? Why efforts to renew the church are often misguided.      Could our preoccupation with making better churches rather than better blessing the world be the heart disease that plagues us? And could our Clause-A theological systems be the high-fat cause of that heart disease?  This is what's really going on beneath all the superficial talk of "emerging church." Far more than cosmetics are under consideration: the very purpose of the church, the gospel, and the pastorate are being re-thought. If that doesn't disturb, surprise, or excite you, you won't understand what is being said.    Great article from Brian Mclaren, you may have to register to follow the link.  But its free and worth it.

      I went to the whole night of prayer at Church for a little bit on Friday.  We were singing  urlLink Amazing Grace  its an awesome personal story of God's redemtive work in a former slave trader's life.  But the last verse made me think...   When we’ve been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise Than when we’d first begun.   It's great to look forward to an eternity with God, the trouble is I often dismiss it as a future thing.  A glory that is to come.   But I want to live out my life now.  I want to see God's kingdom grow here.  I want to see the sick healed, the oppressed freed, the hungry fed, the hurt comforted; in my world.  I want to work for heaven now, not dream of one day being there.  And I suspect that my dream is in line with God's, and that he's already doing just that.

       urlLink The shortlist for the most interesting music prize of the year  was released last week.  There doesn't seem to be the odd outsiders like in previous years but its a pretty good list.  Obvious (but not undeserved) nominations for Keane, Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol and the Streets.    Very exciting to see Ty nominated though!   It'll be a tough year to call.  I reckon it will go to the streets.  He missed out to Ms Dynamite 2 years ago and A grand don't... is probably the most ambitious album on the list.  But the Mercury often has a surprise at the end.

      I've been enjoying the new CMS site  urlLink Blah  online.  Its intended to be a community point that is driven by mission.    One of the first articles there was  urlLink A Complex Christ for an Emerging Urban World . by Kester Brewin.  Here's a little quote...   "This is what we celebrate when we break the bread and share the wine: Christ’s body, centralised, located physically in one place, is broken and distributed amongst the gathering of believers who then disperse. The elements are internalised, made invisible. The distributed body is thus taken out to infect the community. Unseen. Not controlled by a temple, not dictated by a hierarchy. The network of the Spirit is spreading like yeast through dough. It cannot be pared from the community it lives among, it cannot be singled out and destroyed, branded sacred or secular."      Don't just read my quote though, go look at the whole article!!!   And then maybe buy his book -  urlLink The Complex Christ , it out this month.  Its going on my wish list.

       urlLink the next generation of theologians will start as bloggers  is manifesto for aspiring theoblogian's from  urlLink Dan Hughes .   urlLink   Steve Taylor  responds with a thoughtful note of caution  urlLink here   I see myself as an un-theologian who likes to indulge in talking and thinking about God.  Blogging has profoundly changed the way I do that.  It has put me in contact with conversations that involve trained theologians as well as people committed to living out their faith and finding answers along the way (I'm not suggesting that theologians may not do that by the way).    I have had a suspicion for a long time that "good" theology is shaped by the experience of our walk and in particular by our acts of mission.  As such when we get together and talk we don't pool our ignorance but rather share our stories of what God might be doing.    Maybe the next generation of theologians won't just be bloggers.  But I hope they will be story tellers committed to conversation.

      ...in  urlLink NI  is this; it made me laugh.    "Dr Laura Schlesinger is a US broadcaster who dispenses advice to people who call her radio show. This is a letter from an appreciative listener.   Dear Dr Laura,  Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be  an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to follow them.  a) When I burn a bull on the altar of sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev 1:9). The problem is my neighbours. They claim the odour is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness. (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence. d) Lev 25-44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, providing they are purchased from neighbouring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?  e) I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?  f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev 11: 10) it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?  g) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?  h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they die?  i) I know from Lev 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?  j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24: 10-16) Couldn't we just bring them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their In-Iaws? (Lev 20:14).  1 know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.  Your faithfull listener,   P. Uzzled"    Well, it was kind of a laugh until you cry moment.

      This months copy of  urlLink New Internationalist  came through my door today.  It is entitled "In the name of God:  The uses and abuses of religion."  It includes sobering articles on the relationship between religion and violence and the inspiring story of Social Justice worked out by Catholic Bishops in Brazil. There's also a very interesting article by David Boulton who asks,  "Who needs religion?"  I kinda like his concluding paragraph...   "Enabling dreams of Paradise, a world where swords will be beaten into ploughshares, a counter-reality which glimpses and alternative republic of heaven on earth, where peace is built on justice rather than conquest ... this, not virgin births, second comings, holy wars and infallible books, is the real stuff: hard-core religion in action.  And we have a basic need for that, even if we know the need can never be wholly satisfied, the itch never healed."   While I might disagree about some of the doctrine stuff I find the this an incredibly challenging reminder of the mission of Christ.

      School is so nearly out - No more teaching this year.  I've just got 2 more days of packing up and moving boxes etc. as the school gets ready to move into our shiny new premises.  I'm going to be going part time at school next year so that I can huddle lead in  urlLink Form  - well exciting!  We did it when it was Tribal Training a few couple of years back and H has been Huddle leading this year.  I reckon it is one of the best forums for working out what it means to be called to mission in the emerging church.  As an added bonus, my school have been amazingly accommodating about it and have given me a lot of grace.     One of the things this will mean is that H and I are going to stop looking to buy a house for now.  We could have barely afforded to buy this year so going part time means its really out of the question.  We both got kinda mixed feelings about this but think that what we're doing is the right thing.

         We're going away 6th - 21st August and wondered if anyone is able to look after our kitten Dylan. You could either house-sit or he can come and stay with you. He's very friendly and fully house trained. He will be extremely appreciative, as will we. If you're able to help please get in touch.  (He is now a bit bigger than this picture but still just as cute!)

      Helen and I went down to the excellent  urlLink Peace in the Park  festival in Endcliffe Park on Saturday.  It was put on in aid of Water Aid and  urlLink Assist .  4 different tents/stages did drum and bassy dance, world beats and dubby stuff, proper bands (punk, ska and a kind of jewish sounding jazz) and more acoustic stuff.  The variety meant that it was the perfect place to chill out (but a little damp).  As well as all this, and several stalls for campaigning, was a Healing Field, with lots of spiritual bits and bobs.  We were a little apprehensive about this but went to have a look anyway.  It was very peacefull and sunny.  Lots of different stuff from different people there (but no church sadly).  In the middle on a big old oak were a load of poems and quotes, including this...  Flame Dancing Spirit, come Sweep us off our feet and Dance us through our days. Surprise us with your rythms; Dare us to try new steps, explore New patterns and new relationships; Release us from old routines To swing in abandoned joy and Fearful adventure. And  in the intervals, rest us in your still centre, Amen.                              Ann Lewin  I loved it.  What an invocation of the Holy Spirit.  Thinking about getting involved for next year.

      An alternaitive creed that was in last week's  urlLink Guardian Review .  I like the sentiment of it.

      It was a classic "after the storm" morning in Sheffield today. Clear still sky, droplets of water on the grass and plants and lots and lots of sun.  The air had that beautiful mixture of wet grass and flowers.  It reminded me of being at my Gran's house.  Dylan was enjoying the sunshine and rolling around making an exhibition of himself.  I've since discovered he has quite a human fanbase along our road.  The week has been pretty good.  I've found that way to deal with that anxiety thing is to stop, relax and just enjoy the scenery.  Maybe things can happen without me, maybe I'm not quite as important as I thought.  Last weekend we went to my cousin Dora and Mark's wedding in Tunbridge Wells.  A lot of may (fairly large) family were there.  It was a lot of fun to hang out with cousin's and family.  I appreciate coming from a large clan.  The wedding itself took place at  urlLink High Rocks  in an awesome old Barn.  Just over the Road were the  urlLink high rocks .  An woodland area with large sandstone cliffs - pretty impressive surroundings.  While at home my brother Francis introduced me to  urlLink Look Around You .  It's a very silly, affectionate, spoof on old school science shows - mad me laugh a lot.  Check it out.  Try the  urlLink Brain Quiz  to get you started.  Helen and I are off on a bit of an adventure this week.  We're going to New Wine first to work at the Emerging Church venue, looking forward to getting to know a few peeps there.  Then off to Snowdonia for a week of hills, rest and family.  We haven't been out of Sheffield for this long since we got married 3 years ago.    Posting will be sporadic at best.

      the last 2 posts were both sourced on  urlLink Maggi Dawn's blog .  I've been reading it for a while now.  It consistently provides thoughtful inspiration.

       urlLink quite a scathing attack on the Emerging Church , but one that raises a lot of issues.  My big concern with the whole "emeraging church" thing (and I speak as someone trying to do it) is that it can simply become a new vocabulary, a few cool images and rituals that we just place onto a a pre-existing Christianity Package to fit us like cultural camoflage.   I'm not sure that level of change is enough.  Where the emerging conversation excites me is in the places that we talk about new ways of relating to God and new ways of serving our world that are approriate to now.  I don't particularly want to make cool services or have great things.  But I feel a needed for humble commitment to rethinking how certain things are done.  I know its just  a label and its just branding.  But the wholesale use of the "emerging church" title makes me feel a little too self important.

      Anxiety seems to have been boring a hole into me of late.  I guess the problem is this.  I want to do something good.  I don't want to let people down - and I worry that I do.  I wish I just didn't care what people thought.  That I could say forget it and get on with my own thing.  But I do and so I worry and it seems to stop me from doing the things I want to.  I guess I need to stop trying to prove myself and remember that, whatever, I'm loved.
