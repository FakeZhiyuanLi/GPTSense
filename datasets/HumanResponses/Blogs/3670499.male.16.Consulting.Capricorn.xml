      ok so im watching custers last stand on the history channel right? and the indian tribes are getting together and are gonna beat the crap outa the 7th cav and they start smoking a peace pipe so im wondering whats in a peace pipe that makes it so peacefull? i dunno whatever it is it worked weird thing is the indians used winchester m.1873s against em- they are repeaters...the 7th cav had spencers or sharps or springfeilds...one shots...not cool they didnt have a chance lol no chance whatsoever and whats confusing is the fact that the 7th shot their horses when they got sorrounded whats the point of that... they cant run now the indians are on horses shooting the shit outa them...its so gay... and custer was such a smart dude too tho...34 out of 34th in west point not so spiffy...he got to be a brigader general at 23..some kinda record...he just kinda fucked up i guess...i think theyre saying his sub commanders dumped him...and he was alone with 200 someodd men...againts 400 i think...and about 4000 were 15 miles away...close enough to help jeez dontcha just hate when people ditch u? i do... rook
