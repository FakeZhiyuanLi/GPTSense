           “There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.”          – Napoleon Bonaparte                               Today celebrates the birthday of Napoleon, who was born this day in 1769.    Napoleon, of all the modern tyrants, seems to me to be in some ways the most sympathetic.    Napoleon was a great legal reformer.    Not since times Byzantine had a ruling sovereign so systematically endeavored to return society  and  government to heel under the rule of law.    And by reviving Roman law, which had in so many respects lapsed during the age of absolute monarchy, Napoleon helped to rebuild for France and for Europe a solid foundation from which individuals, and indeed civilization could thrive.    That reform continues to bear his name: “The Napoleonic Code.”    On the other hand, much of this is owed to Napoleon’s march of conquest across the Continent, where he sowed his legal seed along the way.    But then I suppose in a cosmic sense nothing comes without a price.                    Napoleon’s rise to power was directly related to the chaos and lawlessness facilitated by a string of corrupt and uncontrollable governments during and following the French Revolution.    Anyone who has studied this era of European history understands that two of the primary forces driving the French Revolution were taxes and forced prohibition against social mobility.    In other words, the people were tired of getting fleeced, and were unwilling to accept a situation where they could not hope and work for a better lot in life.    Only governments can impose such restrictions, and we should remember that they do so at the point of the bayonet.                        Engaging in speculative history is futile at best.    But I imagine that had ole’ Louis cut certain taxes and removed the exclusion of ordinary people from achieving wealth and rank, (i.e. he allowed the people to rise or fall socially under their own private labors) not only would the French Revolution never have happened, but the monarchy would likely have survived in some form even to today.    Of course, then we would have no reason to celebrate the birthday of Napoleon, who today would have turned 235.                        Napoleon Bonaparte          (1769 – 1821)         R.I.P.

       As the 2004 Olympiad races off in all its banner waving glory, I am stuck by two somewhat contradictory notions.    First is the notion of world community.    I suspect that anyone who watched the opening ceremonies on television could not help but to be caught up in the excitement of these countless peoples being brought together to this one place; marching in step not as to war, but in peace and celebration.    Men and women who on the battlefield would consider one other his mortal enemy compete instead on a field of athletic excellence.    And one could be forgiven for buying into the tired commentary of journalists better suited to newsroom sound bites than rhetorical eloquence who call all humanity to see in ourselves the potential for peaceful coexistence and community.

      It’s “common knowledge” that the world is overcrowded. As children and as adults, we are told over and over that the world has “too many people,” but that statement is meaningless. What is too many people?  For decades, fears ranged that China didn’t have the capacity for its billion plus. There was enough land for farms or buildings. Doomsayers make that claim to this day even while China claims the world’s largest golf course.  That’s right, China’s Mission Hill recently became the world’s largest golf course, containing some 180 holes. Founder David Chu invested some $400 million in the complex since its founding in 1993.   Doomsayers often claim that golf courses are a waste of space because they take up so much room, so little of which is used at any given time. But if golf courses are truly a “waste of space” then why does China now fashion over 170 of them?   In fact, those one billion plus are a boon, not a burden. With so many minds at work, it’s clear that whatever land problem that may or may not have existed in China haves been subsided. If that wasn’t true, Chu would have invested in a few dozen apartment buildings.

      Richard Grasso, former head of the New York Stock Exchange, is suing the organization for being forced to resign. Sen. John Edwards called his pay package of $140 million in deferred compensation and retirement benefits “excessive,” according to the CNN website. Business leaders called his salary inappropriate for someone in his financial position of power, especially since it’s a non-profit organization.  As usual, critics are playing pretend in two ways. Grasso was head of the stock exchange for 36 years and the exchange isn’t exactly a typical (if there is such a thing) non-profit organization. They are not desperate for cash, as what most people imagine non-profits to be. The NYSE can most certainly afford to pay Grasso the sum and after three and a half decades, who’s to say that he doesn’t deserve it? Only those who work for the NYSE have the appropriate local knowledge to best ascertain his performance. No one else is in a position to criticize.  As for his position in power, I fail to understand how his large salary should affect his credibility. Now if he was investing that money in the stock market, that may be cause for concern or inquiry but as simply a salary, how does that translate into possible corruption? What’s important is what he does with it and, in that case, the size of the salary shouldn’t matter.

      I am not sure that we can easily state that such a law significantly changes the job market.  Obviously, the key variable in understanding the problem here is price sensitivity. It would be interesting to see if there is a noticeable difference in the purchase of plastic bottles in Iowa. If the drop in demand for cans is made up for in the demand for bottles, then what we have essentially done is made a system of wealth transfer from can producers to bottle producers (though I would venture to suggest that they might be the same firms).  While Iowa can claim a 2% raise in recycling (though I might suggest that other factors might have been relevant, such as the rise of a recycling culture), what happens to the people who never claim their money? As David points out, on the aggregate, this is a significant portion of income that is not being spent elsewhere. The rest is obvious.

      It’s the summer again and for me that means it’s time for me to engage in my Diet Coke shopping ritual.  Luckily for me, the local grocery store was having a sale on 24 packs, cutting a dollar off the normal price. So I grabbed three and headed for the check out lane only to pay $1.20  extra  for each pack.  I should mention I live in Iowa and in 1978, Iowa enacted legislation requiring consumers to pay the deposit on cans when they purchase them. The idea is that five cents a can isn’t enough incentive to get people to return their used aluminum for recycling. But if the government took that money away first, people would be more willing to get it back.  Supporters of the law claim that an additional 2% of all cans bought in the state are returned because of the law, hence the law is a good thing. What supporters don’t understand that is recycling isn’t an act of pure good and coercing people to do it isn’t akin to the acts of Robin Hood (who also has his own problems).  By increasing the price of pop and beer, it harms the plants, truckers and grocery stores that sell the product. It’s also five cents a can that the consumer doesn’t get to buy on other things. Over the course of the summer, I drink probably 15 dozens cans of Diet Coke; the law costs me an extra nine dollars over the season. And that’s just me. While I’ll admit the aggregate number probably isn’t huge, the 2% increase in returned cans isn’t huge either.   So here’s the choice: do we prefer fewer cans in the dump or more jobs in the market? If you say fewer cans, try telling that to the bottler who just lost his job.

      Tomorrow is the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day and about a quarter of my day is spent at the History Channel which is running a week-long marathon on all D-Day things. Keep in mind, the week isn’t about WWII in general or even an overview of the Western Front. It’s hour after hour of the events directly leading up to D-Day, including the day itself. I think they’ve spent more time talking about these events than the time it took for the events to take place.   “Well, so what?” you ask. What does Austrian economics have to do with D-Day? Obviously, that’s a simple question—economics has to do with everything. But allow me to dwell on one point—knowledge. We Austrians love knowledge and according to the History Channel, just enough went right for the Allies so that D-Day succeeded and much of these advantages were knowledge in nature.  Allow me to focus on my favorite military operation: Operation Bodyguard—aimed to convince the Nazis that the Allied invasion would occur at Pas de Calais. Using double agents, fake tanks and, in one case, an actor pretending to be an Allied general, the Allies were able to convince the Nazis to move hundreds of thousands of troops, including the crucial Panzer tanks, precisely where the Allies wanted them to be—away from Normandy, away from Paris and away from Berlin. On D-Day, Allied troops lost less than ten thousand men, half what was expected. There is no doubt that without this operation, the Allies would have not been able to establish a foothold in Europe. D-Day changed the entire course of the war. The deception was so effective that after the success of D-Day, the Allies continued to send fake messages, convincing the Nazis (for a while) that the landing at Normandy was just a diversion.  A little bit of knowledge changes everything. By altering perceptions, it changes the means-ends framework, which completely changes the playing field. On the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day, let us be reminded about the power of knowledge and its role in today’s society. This lesson is especially important to learn in our modern military—spy networks are more important than ever before because the nature of war is so different. No longer is it army versus army but cloaked insurgents versus army. As the fight against terrorism continues and we rapidly approach the June 30th handover date of Iraq, let us remember that one Austrian interpretation of D-Day tells us to favor focus on good intelligence and deception rather than brute force, a lesson that is all the more true now than it was sixty years ago.  (Correction: For some reason I thought it was the 5th rather than the 4th when I wrote this blog. Obviously, the anniversary is Sunday, not Saturday.)

      I saw The Day After Tomorrow last night with a friend. We, in typical nerd fashion, mocked the science and the acting throughout the entire film. It was enjoyable as a mindless summer action flick. Ultimately, I would say that the only truly unbelievable thing is that Dick Cheney (or whatever the film's VP character was named) would ever admit to being wrong.  It would be difficult to believe that the film does not contain political messages, but what exactly are their conclusions? As far as I can tell, the lessons we were to have learned are as follows:  1. Don't vote for Dick Cheney. 2. Listen to scientists.  Neither lesson is very helpful if the filmmakers seek to change the problem they forecast. I think both David and I are united in our belief that the government is not necessarily (I think David would say "not at all") qualified to resolve such issues as resource depletion. I think the anonymous reply to David's post brings up a good point, that resources are extremely interconnected. Ultimately, if the price of petroleum rises, then those products for which petroleum is an input will also rise in price, creating new substitutes.  But the poster also brings up the point that some of these uses for pteroleum have no known substitutes. Understandably, many concerned people would be wary of leaving this problem up to the hope that we find a viable alternative. Short of turning the problem over to the government, which I'm sure will find some pretty inefficient rationing protocols, how do we allay the fears of the worried?

      If you read my last post, you know that I’m a big fan of Bill Nye (the Science Guy) who appeared on CNN a few days ago to tell the viewing public about  The Day After Tomorrow —the film that depicts the world ending a few days thanks to global warming—and how there is no way the events portrayed would happen so quickly.  But Bill said something that didn’t ring true, though it’s one of those things that “just seems right” to most people but doesn’t actually work that way. Bill is deeply concerned about the state of the planet and the speed in which we are using our natural resources. So, he advised us to stave off disaster by using fewer of them—Bill apparently rides his bike everywhere to save on gasoline.  While this seems like the perfect solution to combat global warming, because of the way the economy works it is far from being true. Using fewer fossil fuels drives down their price and creates less incentive for creating cheaper, renewable substitutes. Our economy is large and free enough to sustain legions of entrepreneurs to offer new options when the old ways become too expensive. During the California energy crisis a few years ago, the price of oil skyrocketed and the renewable energy industry boomed as firms invested in solar panels and wind energy. Riding your bike to save money or get exercise is one thing (because these are internal benefits that are the natural response of market activity); riding it to save the environment is another (because it is in pursuit of an external benefit that cannot be measured and, therefore, actually hinders the creation of a solution to the greenhouse problem).  Using more gasoline to get off of it doesn’t make sense to a lot of people but over the course of human history, when one resource gets too expensive, we find substitutes for it. Metals, for example, are always cited as something we will run out and then we’ll be screwed, even though more and more building materials are made from plastics. There’s no reason to think that gasoline is any different. And because we have every reason to believe that we will be richer and more knowledgeable in the future than we are today, we can depend on the fact that our new energy source will be much cleaner than gasoline. Our wealth will allow us to express the new knowledge in new inventions. So let’s not succumb to scare tactics that emphasize short term effects, like riding bikes. Let’s have the courage to look at the big picture and resist the temptation to trade in our car for a ten speed.

      This past Friday  The Day After Tomorrow  premiered: a happy-go-lucky romp about the end of the world that overwhelms in thanks to global warming. If you turned on the news at all on Friday, you would have the pleasure of hearing the mainstream media talk endlessly about the validity of the film’s claims: the devastation of the world will not only occur because of our own doing but it will happen in a weekend. While I was watching the “coverage,” the following question kept bouncing around in my mind:  Is there really so little going on in the world that precious time can be spent talking about if a claim in a big budget disaster film is valid?   This remains me of the endless discussions about genetic engineering that cropped up right after  Jurassic Park  opened. Of course it’s not possible, it’s fantasy: it’s a movie. As a testament to that, CNN brought on my favorite TV personality scientist—Bill Nye (the Science Guy)—who spent most of his air time explaining the complicated processes of the weather phenomena depicted in the film and all the hostess could ask is “But Bill, could this happen in a few days?” to which Bill finally and flatly answered, “No.” After Bill left, CNN continued to discuss the movie’s political ramifications as if there’s no difference between disaster happening over a lifetime (as Bill said was the fastest speed it could happen) and two days.  A lot of this silliness is nested in the public: if we see it in a movie, there’s legitimate reason to believe it can happen. There’s a lot of money and time wasted exploring ideas that some one saw in a movie. There’s a lot of panic that ensues because people take entertainment too literally ( War of the Worlds , anyone?) Let’s leave the science to the scientists.

      Is it just me or do people think that economists are magical creatures, capable of predicting the future and handing out pots of gold to any that follow their instructions?  My brother, Jason, is visiting this weekend for a neighborhood wedding and yesterday he was kind enough to take me out to lunch. On the way to the restaurant, we passed a local McDonald’s an I noticed the drive-thru line stretched at least ten cars long. I passed on to my brother that I’m glad we’re not going there and had an idea why. McDonald’s recently began offering free music downloads. I asked him if he was sure that people are responding that strongly to offer. “Well David,” he asked me, “you’re the economist; do these special offers work?”   This is why economists are known for answering questions the frustrating “It depends:”  it’s always the best answer to such over simplistic questions .  I blame the media’s and public’s willingness to embrace what Paul Krugman calls “policy entrepreneurs,” known as economists that abandon core economic realities in favor of telling politicians what they want to hear.   But Jason’s question opens the door for another question: how much does perception and attitude influence deals like these. Not more than three or four years ago, we were celebrating the miracle of free music from Napster. Now such programs are harder to find and the sheer volume and opportunity won’t reach the miracle that was Napster anytime soon. Like most people, I miss those times of free music; resorting to buying music online instead of simply downloading seems too…tragic to engage in. Even getting free downloads for a normally priced service doesn’t perk my interest. I know I’m not alone and I’m betting McDonald’s offer isn’t working as well as they wished. The only way to know for sure is by how much longer they’ll keep the offer around and if they’ll ever bring it back. Personally, think McDonald’s is always that crowded around lunch time.

      This article is a week ahead of schedule.  About a month ago I stumbled onto  urlLink Wikipedia , a free online encyclopedia. Every entry on the site is created by volunteers, lending their expert knowledge to any entry that they happen to want to create. New entries and updates are posted on a page for anyone to edit as they see fit. At any given time, over a quarter of a million articles are being worked on in the English version. While the  Columbia Encyclopedia 6th Edition  has 6.5 million words, the 2002  Encyclopedia Britannica  has 55 million words and the 2002  Encarta Encyclopedia  has 26 million words, Wikipedia’s three-year-old English version contains over 81.6 million words, a value that increases everyday from over seven thousand contributors.   Naturally, this open system contains immense potential for abuse. Wikipedia is meant to be a reference though it contains no official decree that its pages are accurate. I had to ask myself, are the 7,135 contributors just as good as a handful of paid employees? The other night I ran an experiment, placing ten false articles into the system. The article topics ranged from gardening to economics to entertainment. Sometimes the mistakes were subtle, easily attributed to typos. (Characters of Middle Earth: The assembly of protagonists and antagonists depicted in J.R. Tolstein’s  The Habbit .) Sometime the articles were blatantly wrong. (sampling bias: A form of prejudice that discriminates against the sampos subculture of Lower Manhattan. Those that exercise a sampling bias commonly accuse the sampos people of being too clean and anal retentive, threatening the wild and grimy character of the area.)  I expected to check the site daily and watch the contributors struggle with my articles or ignore them completely. After about a week, I figured I could examine what proportion were corrected.  But in less than an hour of the articles’ publishing contributors cleaned Wikipedia of my errors.  Most of the articles were redirected, meaning the article’s topic was awfully similar to an existing article so my text was replaced with the old text.   One of my articles was deleted by network administrators, the only Wiki members whohave the power to purge their databank of any article. My article was about Marvin Perry, who I claimed was an actor best known for his portrayal of Chandler on  Friends . Wikipedia takes deleting material very seriously—my deleter had to justify the deletion—because while the original article remains available no matter how many times it is redirected or edited, a deletion eliminates the presence of the article completely. However, Wikipedia members can vote for a deletion to be undone so even an administrator lacks absolute power.  There was one article members had trouble with. It said "blue ribbon" is “A show on Comedy Central about comics participating in a dog show.” Defaulting to humble ignorance, a member of the Wiki community named Stormie was about it let it go until he Googled it and checked Comedy Central’s website, yielding no evidence to my claim in either case. He also noted my other contributions were highly suspicious and turned the article into a “candidate for deletion,” meaning he’s suggesting to network administrators to research the topic and delete it if needed. With my experiment complete, I admitted that the article was a fake, hopefully preventing dozens of administrators wandering about the World Wide Web in a hopeless pursuit of a series about comics showing off their dogs. Thankfully, my "blue ribbon" article no longer exists.  Wikipedia is an organic encyclopedia, using the disperse nature of knowledge to its advantage by opting out of a position of control. It relies on the fun and inherent satisfaction people experience when they participate in teaching others. As such, it is extremely accurate (Ronald Regan’s entry, for example, was updated mere hours after his death). In Michael Polanyi’s words, Wikipedia represents the dynamic order that evolves when freedom is paramount. It is self-ordering, self-correcting and even the most influential lack absolute power.

      Tonight NBC premieres the 2,453rd reality season: the second season of  Last Comic Standing . By sheer coincidence VH1 is ran a repeat of  The Secrets of Reality Television Exposed  the other day. The show tags itself as the reality behind reality television, recounting the antics of the genre’s past few years.  The show focuses on the people that made the so-called reality shows reality, with a special emphasis of how much it screwed up their lives, complaining that they will always be defined from one embarrassing moment on television. One woman from  The Bachelor  commented that while she has numerous degrees and traveled the world, she will always be known as the woman who made the “slurping sound” in the bushes with the star. These unfortunate illustrious insinuate that they are victims: they were promised fame and fortune but were manipulated, embarrassed and used then thrown out without compensation.   Of course, no where in the contract they signed that said they were promised a damn thing, including not being embarrassed. Let’s not kid ourselves, the drama—no matter how inflated—is why reality television is so popular. That’s why people who understand that rarely want to go on reality television: the chances are you will be worse off. I hold no remorse for the person that thought they would be handed immense wealth without being risked with notoriety and embarrassment.  Ironically, this show came from the network that brings us such respectable shows like  50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs…Ever ,  Best Week Ever ,  VH1’s Ill-ustrated  and  The Greatest: 40 Greatest Celebrity Feuds —all of which carefully document the most embarrassing moments of the lives of the famous. To anyone that’s ever complained that the media is too intrusive, that they are tired of the paparazzi in their face, that they don’t want their biggest mistakes common knowledge, I say this: If you want all the benefits of fame, then you better be prepared to costs. If you want people taking your picture all the time, you better be prepared to have it taken when you lest want it to be. You can’t get something—especially something as power as fame—for nothing. Grow up, America.

      On this D-Day anniversary, let us be reminded of the freedom that the soldiers fought for: freedom from totalitarianism, tyranny and oppression. Concentrated power is the single most common source of evil, determining winners and losers to further its personal interests—Hitler’s Germany is but one extreme example of it. But Nazism is long dead; as we remember our fallen heroes let us focus our right to liberation to another fortress of power, one that is far less evil but far more influential in today’s world: the Federal Reserve.  Last night I finished Roger Lowenstein’s  When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management , a book Mike recommended and now a book I’m recommending to you, our reader (let’s not kid ourselves; there’s only one of you). It depicts the events surrounding a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a fund so arrogant it felt as though it could predict the future by examining the past. Over a dozen major banks had their fingers deep in the fund even though the partners refused to tell anyone what exactly their portfolio consisted of, scared that the word of their strategy would spread. And then, in 1998, everything changed. Events the fund did not predict—Russia’s default of its loans and the Asian crises—wrecked havoc on its portfolio and the fund was losing millions  every day . If the fund went bankrupted, the Federal Reserve feared that it would send shocks throughout the worlds’ economy, possibly collapsing a financial system that was already on its knees.  While the Fed did not send LTCM the $4 billion it needed to hold on, it did call in the presence of the major banks on Wall Street to organize a deal. After a lot of pushing and prying the banks complied, even though most of them didn’t agree to the terms, and LTCM held on. In fact, it held on so well, it turned around after the markets started returning to normal. Meanwhile, the partners of LTCM remain millionaires to this day. Thinking it was doing the world a favor, it manipulated the outcome.  Because of the Fed’s intervention, the banks were able to save a fund that should have completely and utterly failed. While one could argue that the banks would’ve have got together and save LTCM because they had a vested interest in doing so. But the Fed’s intervention occurred at the last minute—the banks clearly thought it wasn’t worth it. The banks should have been taught a lesson that can only be learned by paying the penalty of massive losses: don’t invest in a fund that a) claims to be clairvoyant and b) refuses to say what they’re doing. But no one needs to learn a lesson more than the fund’s partners, who stayed on for another year after the banks bought, and made six figure salaries. By all but forcing cooperation, the Fed prevented losers from losing, like a principle telling a teacher to inflate the grades of a star athlete. By denying one of the most basic freedoms in a capitalist society—the freedom to fail—lessons are not learned. John Meriwether, the original founder of LTCM, started a new fund in late 1999, raising as much as half of a billion dollars. This new fund (JWM Partners) would follow many of the same strategies as LTCM. Let us pray…

      In a country built on freedom, it amazes me how often people confuse the difference between a right and a privilege.  According to a report by CNN a few days ago, the United States lingers behind European countries in term of, in CNN’s words, “workers rights.” Two of these so-called rights enumerated by CNN are paid vacation and paid maternity leave. Let me get one thing straight: getting paid for work you don’t do is not—repeat IS NOT—a right. Workers, international or otherwise, have no more of an entitlement to getting paid for doing nothing than firms have a right to make their employees work without paying them. Getting something for time you don’t work is a privilege that must be earned.  No doubt proponents of Europe’s “rights” claim that denying these people payment is a form of penalizing them. “Why should someone be punished for having a child?” But you could ask the same of the company that has to pay Jane a steady salary even though she’s not helping them make that money. Or of her co-workers that have to pick up the slack in her absence but can’t get paid more because the company has to pay Jane instead. Why should the business and her co-workers be punished for her pregnancy? Are we really willing to say that some people—like families—are more deserving than others? Like a vacation, having a baby can be very nice but there are costs to nice things. Paying them is called responsibility.

      The very reason governments justify their funding of projects like fiber optics is because such things could easily become expensive. Why would a private company spend so much money on laying the cable for a network that would benefit the public, but might put the company out of business? The truth of networking is that the most expensive thing tends to be placing the wiring. Cable TV is fundamentally a federal project, given how many subsidies went into laying the cables. Granted, this was because the wireless options (antennae) were insufficient to meet the demands of rural areas.  But this is no longer a problem. 802.11g ("WiFi") and upcoming wireless protocols are fast approaching speeds that cable networks offer, and is significantly cheaper than wiring a building. Satellite TV requires only a single object in the sky--no subsidies there--and offers what would be a cheaper alternative to cable if it weren't for those nasty subsidies.  But in the short-term, it is hard for the government to look forward and have faith that someone might privately create a solution. Legislatures pat themselves on the back all the time about faith in the market. But when the market hasn't already solved the problem, they promptly try to solve it themselves, with projects like Iowa's little network.

      Sunday’s  urlLink Des Moines Register  confirmed something we Austrians already know: states aren’t good conduits for creating goods people will use. Sure, there are exceptions—like national security—but when it comes to technological infrastructure, especially in this age of increasing genuine uncertainty, bureaucrats just don’t cut it though they act like they can.  That’s the painful lesson Iowa’s Democratic legislators are learning as they desperately try to get the state-run fiber optics network, a $356 million investment, to turn a profit. Republican legislators, however, are trying to sell the network, which would have to be sold for a fraction of the investment.  Why is this fiber optics network that once attracted foreign representatives to the state to study it for their own countries such a burden, today? Over ten years ago, the Iowa’s government decided to create the ICN (Iowa Communications Network) to administer a new network that would link the state’s government agencies to the greater world. Especially designed for schools and colleges, the ICN would link institutions via video and become a valuable teaching tool for Iowa’s schools, especially the rural ones. But the network’s conception was back in the late 80s and earlier 90s, before the Internet became a practical (and cheaper) alternative. Now it’s horribly obsolete, expensive to run and the only thing schools tend to use the network for—Internet access—may be made obsolete by emerging technologies like wireless communication.   Supporters of Iowa’s own version of the Great Wall (another big project that never proved worth it) claim the project is akin to the country’s interstate for its premise is no different: it’s a network for transporting information. But the physical infrastructure of superhighways doesn’t become obsolete by advances in the auto industry. That network isn’t so dependent on the quality of the technology it supports. When Ford creates a new car, it doesn’t require the road to be upgraded. But new information technologies require a better network to carry the larger amounts of data the technologies depend on. Networks provide speed and there is no network fast enough. But rarely do we have to upgrade the highways to accommodate faster vehicles.  Like most government businesses, it would be better to abandon them and leave the risk and glory to private companies who possess the knowledge needed to use the assets more wisely. Because they have a personal stake in its success, they are willing to think about the big picture and acknowledge that technology isn’t constant. When will bureaucrats learn that they can’t predict the future and learn some humility?

      I believe there are few issues that capture the title of our blog as nicely as the so called war on drugs. This war, which by the way we are losing and costs taxpayers  urlLink over $19 billion last year , gains popularity based on a single, flawed premise: people aren’t allowed to do harm to their own bodies. Like laws against suicide, anti-drug laws claim that your life is the responsibility of everyone else. We spend billions to tell people they don’t have the absolute right to use their body as you see fit, even it means harming it.  So that’s why I’m not too upset that my home state, Iowa, ranks number one in the country for meth incidents so far this year, according to yesterday’s Quad City Times, a local newspaper. Of course, that’s not their spin: methamphetamines are evil and the people that use them need to be protected from their own decisions. The article cites medical studies that demonstrate “meth-use in youth [is] ‘scary.’” Like marijuana and alcohol abuse in teens, extensive meth use can cause serious and permanent damage. While I don’t want those crazy kids harming themselves, they  are  becoming adults and telling them they can’t or shouldn’t do something doesn’t encourage them to start thinking long term on their own. In fact, telling them not to do something only encourages them to do it. That’s what being a teenager is about, challenging the status quo in an effort to find your own way.  Unlike most mainstream political thinkers, I don’t think people are a group of mindless nitwits who need to be herded like sheep. When you treat people as dumb and useless, they get pissed off, not surprisingly, leading to apathy, anger and social and cultural rebellion. While most QC Times readers will conclude that Iowa is filled with teens that shouldn’t think for themselves, I see Iowa filled with too many parents who were brought up thinking their kids shouldn’t think for themselves.

      David, you should regain some credibility with Wikipedia by filling in an entry for Beloit College. It's sadly  urlLink missing  from here.  It's past midnight and I have the LSAT in a few hours. Blogging is a good way to put off test anxiety, right?

       urlLink This post  at Marginal Revolution on the wisdom of crowds raises the issue that betting markets are more than just the average of polls. Just a quick glance at the graph shows the discrepancy is not just noise. Certainly a large part of this knowledge has to be that the market participants are also betting on their own future decisions. I think the SEC should be prosecuting most of these market participants for insider trading.

      Could it be that David's unwillingness to have his preference for McDonald's changed by a free download is influenced by the increased availability of music downloads (increased competition), combined with the very low price of music--free, on peer-to-peer networks, and $1 on iTunes?  David raises a more interesting question for me: why the stability of the music download service factors into David's decision as to use the service. My guess is because his music would cease to play were his service of choice to stop working. What was once a good, a CD, an actual object, has become a service,a few megabytes in the internet. iTunes requires permission from Apple to play music downloaded from its store. Some services require monthly payment just to continue playing music already downloaded. So long as the consumers understand these licenses, there is nothing problematic. Every legal music downloading service has within it some aspect of that problem: if the service were ever to shut down, so would the music purchased in that system. Imagine if Amazon.com went bankrupt, and all the books you ever purchased from it were to disappear in a cloud of smoke. Granted, if one of these services were to go under, it is likely that another service would act quickly to serve its customers. However, it is nearly certain that such a shift would result in a changing of the terms of the original contract.  Knowing that the stability of the music seller is tied in with the future availability of purchased goods should make consumers wary of using these stores. Personally, I have not spent money on these stores (though I was quite happy to obtain several albums through Pepsi's promotion in February). This problem should arise in any industry like this--Microsoft's monopoly is in a large part a function of its ability to signal to consumers that it has long-term stability.  I know iTunes has been wildly successful, but I do not have many statistics on other services, such as emusic.com. However, given that the major players in the field are Apple and Walmart--companies whose future does not depend on selling music--I would venture to say that the question of stability may play a factor in consumer choice.

      I think David has said more than I could about the content of Fahrenheit 9/11. What I find most interesting about Michael Moore is not the content of his speech, but the method of it. Most people criticize his methods: loaded questions, impromptu interviews, inflammatory remarks, and embarrassing footage are all part of his rhetorical tricks. I have even had conversations with friends who disliked him because he did not attempt to be objective. While I frequently disagree with him on any number of issues--outsourcing, for example--I actually find his methods to be a breath of fresh air.  Yes, Moore frequently invites himself into places he does not belong, and pesters people who do not wish to be bothered. Yes, he accuses businessmen of any number of sins. Yes, he airs footage of personalities acting like insensitive or immoral people. Critics are equally capable of fighting back, with lawsuits, if he violates their property (they do), or speaking out against him, as any  urlLink number  of  urlLink people   urlLink do .  I consider one of the best testaments to the fact that democracy is still vibrant and active despite Congress's best intentions to stop it to be  urlLink Move America Forward 's attempt to convince movie theatres not to show the film. They are genuinely acting as they should: voting their beliefs with their wallets, just as I voted my belief with my wallet by attending the first matinee showing of the day (price discrimination: also great!). What is frightening, though, is the attempt now to prevent Moore from advertising his movie under FEC rules that limit political ads.  According to FEC general counsel, documentaries with a political bias and ads for them can be considered to be electioneering, and thus under the regulations of  lunacy  legislation like McCain Feingold, can be limited by the government. The FEC has declined to act on this situation, but that is not to say that either the laws do not apply to the movie, or that they will not weeks from now. The law, as it stands, is probably, as the FEC says, sufficient to limit what Michael Moore can do to advertise his movie. I forsee this as having a chilling effect on future documentaries. Moore has the clout and the buzz to get the movie publicity without television advertisements, but what of smaller documentary makers? But more importantly, what of his and everyone else's right to have public discourse without the government regulating the nature of that discourse? If Moore was genuine about getting discussion going on in the United States, he should come out tomorrow against all campaign finance laws.

      I just got back from seeing Michael Moore’s new movie,  Fahrenheit 9/11 . In case you live under a rock, the movie turns a critical eye to the Bush administration, accusing them of lying to the American public about White House’s reasons for invading Iraq.   There’s a lot I want to say about the documentary beyond the fact that I thought it was an excellent flick everyone should see. But lingering just below the surface of the movie is its most important lesson, a lesson we continuingly have to relearn.   Nothing better captures this lesson than  Crossfire ’s Tucker Carlson’s  urlLink interview  last September with pop singer Britney Spears. In response to a question about if she supports the war in Iraq, Britney said, “Honestly I think we should just trust our president in every decision he makes and should just support that, you know, and be faithful in what happens.” I was able to bear a gruesome fifteen minutes of today’s  Crossfire , long enough to hear Carlson completely agree with her.  What Spears and Carlson are telling us is that we should never question our leadership, which is precisely what the documentary does. There’s a growing consensus in our government that questioning the establishment is evil. The very fact that Moore had trouble finding a distributor for such a controversial film is reminiscent of his accusations that both the media and the Democrats weren’t asking enough questions. Far too many were either too lazy or too cowardly to challenge the Man.  Being able to face the status quo is the cornerstone of creating a better world. Just as firms challenge each other to create a better industry, ideas need to be able to challenge each other to create a better society. When institutions, like the American government, insist that the nonconformists are unpatriotic (a claim that I’m sure the authors of the Declaration of Independence would disagree with), and we accept those claims, we start down the road to oppression. When Spears and Carlson promote passive complacency, they miss everything this country stands for.   Moore fittingly ended his documentary with a quote from  1984 . In it, we are reminded of the connection between powerlessness and ignorance, between the rulers and the silencers, between absolute power and its maintenance through war. Even if you don’t like Michael Moore, you should see this documentary just to remind yourself of your right—no, your duty—to question everything.

      The  urlLink Des Moines Register  had an article Sunday about an Iowa company named Chapman Lumber, a timber firm who is finding success in exporting Iowa’s (apparently) abundant supply of high quality hard woods to China and Europe. Now I never thought of my home state as a fortress for quality lumber—like most people I associate that role with Canada—but apparently Iowa’s good at something that doesn’t involve corn. No one is more surprised than I.  Economics and biology have a lot in common, and not just when biological organisms, like trees, are bought and sold. While I’ll concede that there are differences between Economic and Darwinian evolution, these differences do not hamstring our understanding of trade. When Mike tells us that Darwinian evolution cannot explain the learning process, he’s reminding us that the forebears of Darwin were wrong: a giraffe cannot learn to lengthen its neck to reach food but a company can learn to improve its structure to reach profits. But there is a learning process in biological evolution. It’s harder to see because, unlike economics, it occurs over hundreds or thousands or million of years, but it is there.  Chapman Lumber most definitely engaged in a learning process when it sought out the Chinese and European markets. It learned what they needed, it learned what it had and it evolved to take advantage of that knowledge. It wasn’t always this way—China’s surge of growth started long after Chapman Lumber started in 1954—but it is happening now so the company can capture more profit. Iowa’s one billion dollar hardwood industry originates in the fact that a long, long ago, hardwood seeds prospered here. Obviously, these seeds did not actively seek out the Hawkeye State. It is far more reasonable that they spread all over primarily because the forest grew and in the Midwest they flourished. Like Chapman Lumber, hardwoods carved out a niche in foreign soil and like Chapman Lumber, these plants adapted to their new soil.   True, Chapman Lumber learned actively. It did not send wood to every country it could think of and stuck with the one that bought the product. But I argue that the woods learned too, though they are not aware of it. The oak, cherry, walnut and hickory seeds learned passively and tacitly. They did not try to learn anything while struggling to survive in the world, nor are they aware they’ve learned anything. These species tacitly know they can survive here because they didn’t die out in the face of competing species and their children flourish here.   Howard Baetjer teaches us that capital is embodied knowledge: my microwave has knowledge about physics stored up in its structure that allows it to work. And because that and other knowledge is applied in my microwave, I don’t need to know anything about physics to create a hot meal in seconds. Similarly, the structure of a firm or species is embodied knowledge. If I became a Chapman Lumber employee tomorrow, I could benefit from the job security that their firm allows because of the knowledge it embodies. Similarly, if I became an oak seed organism tomorrow I could benefit from the knowledge that I can prosper in Iowa without having to “learn” it. In both cases, I am not at risk if the direction the species/firm is going happens to be wrong. The knowledge that embodies Chapman Lumber’s assets and oak trees’ location and DNA tells me everything will be fine.  This example can be applied to any species to demonstrate that it learns because the knowledge it gains—even if it is passive and tacit—is embodied in the organism’s structure. The giraffe’s longer neck embodies the knowledge that a longer neck is needed to survive for this species. Future giraffes do not bear the costs of the painful learning process when giraffes with shorter necks die out. The learning process occurs, but it is passive and skips the realization step. Organisms never say, “Ah ha! A longer neck lets me get more food!” or “Iowa is a good place to grow!” But employees can declare, “China is the future of this company and here is why.”   Competition is the engine of economic (and biological) progress. Giraffes had to “learn” the value of longer necks because the competition of food sources close to the ground was too fierce. Forests grow because plants “learn” they have a better chance of surviving on the outer edge of the forest rather than within—where light and water are scarcer. It’s not that competitive language is a poor way to describe the benefits of trade; it’s that people do understand the full implications of trade.

      It is my understanding that I am not breaking my contract with the LSAC by posting this. If I later realize that I am, obvious parts will be excised.  One of the questions on last week's LSAT was something like this: Surveys show that members of Country X would prefer a situation where Country X's economy grows by 10% and Country Y's economy grows by 8% to a situation where Country X's economy grows by 15% and Country Y's economy grows by 20%, even though the second situation was better for Country X. Which answer explains this apparent dilemma?  My answer was that the respondents preferred beating the other country to doing well individually. Experience with economics seems to be quite helpful on that test, as the situation did not seem foreign to me. That is, not that I feel the same way, but that I encounter this often.  I believe this is to a large part because we use the wrong terminology in explaining trade. We discuss trade in the lgnaugae of firm-to-firm competition, a language which does not grasp mutually beneficial trade. I think we make this mistake because we also mistake Darwinian evolution for Market evolution [David will follow up with an argument against that point, I hope]. The language we use is couched in Darwinian terms--the competition between firms, the concept of survival of the fittest, etc. can fit to some degree when discussing firm-to-firm competition, but it, too, cannot explain the learning that takes place through competition.  My overly optimistic and unrealisitc suggestion? Quit explaining trade as competition between nations. Start explaining market activity as more than just competition. When you start with the model of perfect competition as the framework for understanding market activity, you lose large parts of the story.

      In a recent column by Thomas Sowell (not one of my favorite columnists, by far) suggests that the push by Iraqi leaders to make foreign workers subject to Iraqi law is dangerous. He  urlLink writes  :    Obviously subjecting foreign workers and entrepreneurs to a wholly different legal system from the one they are used to is creating yet another obstacle to recruiting people whose skills and experience are urgently needed to get Iraq back on its feet again as a functioning society.   In short, he believes that non-Iraqis in Iraq should not be compelled to follow Iraqi law, for the sake of the stability that those non-Iraqis might feel, not having to deal with laws that might be different than in their home country. No mention of how home countries would actually have the ability to enforce their laws in sovereign nations, which might be relevant given the Bush Administration's defense in the Guantanamo Bay cases--that Guantanamo Bay is not on American soil and thus American law does not apply.  Sowell proceeds to compare the insistence on the local rule of law with ineffective symbolism. Given how much effort Sowell makes to suggest that law is a powerful signal to individuals as to what the customs and proper actions are, it seems silly to suggest that anything so large as suggesting that people in Iraq must follow its laws--regardless of their nationality--can be explained away as trivial symbolism.  I imagine he would be completely opposed to any states rights issues, as well?

      Today marks the first time in history that a privately funded ship left the cradle of earth, joining the nations that have set foot in space. SpaceShipOne, one of over two dozens competing vessels, is well on its way to winning the X Prize, a $10 million prize to the first team that can send a three-manned (or equivalent) ship into space and repeat the achievement within two weeks.  What the  urlLink X Prize  captures is the freedom to try, to explore and to fail—all freedoms law and legislation tend to constrict. Without the worry of a government overseer, competitors can explore whatever theory or idea they wish and because there’s a prize, there’s focus, urgency and cohesion that jumpstarts the competition. Michael Polanyi advocated a “dynamic order” that shuns central planning and encourages in engaging “the full possibilities of research.” The X Prize is just one example of the dynamic order: a freedom-loving structure that lays the groundwork for scientific leaps. It is a formula for future research.   I’m not sure exactly what makes a prize for something as inspiring as space flight—maybe it’s the publicity that captures the imagination of the scientist, maybe it’s the guaranteed bonus that finally convinces someone it’s worth the risk and time, maybe it’s atmosphere and buzz that comes with a competitive environment. Really, it’s all of them and other reasons I can’t yet identify. We do know it’s not just a matter of the prize money. SpaceShipOne’s team—Scaled Composites, LLC—spent $20 million to get this far, more than twice the value of the prize. This isn’t unusual. During the Orteig Prize, the prize Charles Lindbergh won when he flied from New York to Paris without stopping, other competitors often spent more than the $25,000 prize.  Why do people spend more than the guaranteed return of the prize (which itself already isn’t guaranteed)? Why, when left to their own devices, do individuals exaggerate their own risk by spending so much? Perception and experience. Everyone knows that completing the prize will spawn a new era of travel and a new industry that the winners will be at the helm of. And even the losers of the prize may turn out to be economic winners. Every team has access to a unique body of knowledge that may prove useful outside the context of the prize. Armadillo Aerospace, for example, created a new rocket fuel, one that’s more powerful and cheaper than the fuel NASA uses. Just as the completion of the Orteig Prize spawned the development of the multi-billion dollar aerospace industry, there’s no reason to think that the X Prize won’t do the same.  Today we saw private interests at work, jumpstarted by other private interests. And behind all the activity that led up to the space flight is an enormous body of knowledge that didn’t cost taxpayers a dime. Yet this knowledge will no doubt prove pivotal as travels to space become more affordable and, decades from now, available to the average person.

      The  urlLink Des Moines Register  reported today that college students all over the Midwest are using subsidized housing intended for the poor, straining the federally funded program. Amazingly, people are surprised that students can “get away with it” and want US department of Housing and Urban Development to restructure their eligibility rules.  What the public is really saying is that they are angry that the world isn’t following their neat little plan they told everyone to follow. Like New York’s infamous rent control program, which intended to ensure senior citizens cheap housing but only ensured a select few inexpensive apartments, this law has unintended consequences when as it moved from the lab-like legislative floor to the real world. College students, like anyone with a tight budget, are always looking for the best deals. Perhaps the problem doesn’t rest with the students but with the government rules. While I don’t want anyone to sleep on the streets, trying to manufacture an economy according to some grand plan by constructing layer upon layer of laws isn’t the answer.   A single institution can’t outsmart the collective actions of countless working minds. But by creating the opportunity for new ideas and innovations, by reintroducing the incentive for people to create profitable low income housing, we can find an answer instead of spending millions trying to manufacture the perfect society. Economies are growth, not built.

       Spider-Man 2  made box office records (at number 4), raking in $40.5 million dollars on Wednesday (of which I’m proud to say I was a part of). But the industry’s approach to ranking films is meaningless for the simple reason they ignore a big part of economics: inflation.  It is exciting to keep reporting record-breaking numbers, each reaching new and greater heights, which is probably why no one ever adjusts for inflation. Luckily for us,  urlLink the-numbers.com  did some of that for us. According to “mainstream” numbers, the ranking for the top five highest grossing films at the box office (1977 and after) is as follows:  1 [$600,788,188]  Titanic  (1997) 2 [$460,998,007]  Star Wars  (1977) 3 [$431,197,000]  ET  (1982)  4 [$431,088,297]  Star Wars: The Phantom Menace  (1999) 5 [$403,706,375]  Spider-Man  (2002)  I’m happy to report that, after we adjust for inflation, a story about a kid dying at sea no longer reigns supreme:  1 [$981,848,794]  Star Wars  (1977) 2 [$806,467,408]  ET  (1982) 3 [$774,918,846]  Titanic  (1997) 4 [$573,323,886]  The Empire Strikes Back  (1980) 5 [$560,754,164]  The Return of the Jedi  (1983)  And that’s not even adjusting for population growth. If the goal is to measure a film’s success by the number of tickets sold, shouldn’t we include the change in the number of people to buy tickets? The world population estimate (the numbers above are international box office) grew by 33.65% from 1977 to 2004. Obviously, using this number isn’t very useful (Zimbabweans are less likely to see the newest release than Canadians) but it does indicate that it’s not a simple matter of inflation and it certainly isn’t a matter of nominal dollars.

       urlLink USA Today  recently ran an article reminding Americans of the importance of local and tacit knowledge. With Iraq no longer under the control of American forces, the population is struggling to understand and engage in the basic concepts of democracy, including political organization, law interpretation, combating international sabotage of the elections and so forth.  Why are Iraqis having such a hard time? There’s a great body of knowledge needed to grasp the nuisances of any political system. Iraqi citizens do not have access to this self-ruling knowledge because democracy was transplanted instead of grown. Because Iraq lacks any influential custom of democracy, trying to grasp it is a bit like trying to understand algebra without knowing how to multiply. America has democratic institutions that stretch all the way back to Ancient Greece. Iraq’s democratic customs stretch all the way back to last year.   People have memories and they often look to the past to help answer today’s questions. Iraqi citizens, for example, are afraid of expressing themselves because they are do used to be killed for it. And the problems don’t stop with this generation because they teach and talk to their kids. Twenty, thirty and forty years from now, Iraq’s rising leaders will still favor secrecy and religious texts over secularism and free speech. It’s possible it might even be worse than that. Assuming the “democracy” (is it really a democracy if the citizens don’t understand how it works or was forced on them?) lasts this long, the next generation might be worse at this crazy system than their parents because, like most people, they don’t like being told what to believe. (Especially when the order is “You have a right to choose...but you can’t choose that.”) So will they ever “get it?” There’s no way to tell but forcing it isn’t going to work. Instead of trying to manufacture a political system, America should try to grow it, making suggestions and offering foundation-building requirements, not demanding sweeping reforms. For example, paying groups of locals to police an area instead of paying them to act just like Americans troops among American troops doesn’t build communal relationships, reinforce trust between peoples and remind citizens that they won’t be shot if they say something disagreeable. Even having police officers instead of soldiers teach police work would do wonders.   Ordering someone to be more democratic is not only confusing, it’s hypocritical and illegitimate. Iraqis have to be let to learn for themselves and that includes letting them choose their own government, even if we don’t like it.

      The  urlLink Des Moines Register  reported that Iowa may be taking an important step to liberalization as calls for ending the state control of liquor wholesaling gain voice. The arguments against public ownership are the same—it’s expensive, inefficient and poorly run.  But this case involves an interesting twist. A large part of the work force for the state monopoly comes from Iowa’s prisons who are being paid 37 cents an hour which saves the state millions of dollars and provides job training. But people who cite this argument as justification for a state monopoly miss the point. There’s no reason why the private sector couldn’t employ these inmates instead. Nothing would have to change. And for those that don’t want the state to loose the money, they need to be reminded of the role of government. Governments are not supposed to make money; they are supposed to ensure that other people can make money.

      Economics is everywhere. According to the History Channel, 90% of all gold discovered in the world was discovered after 1848. Considering that people have been looking for gold since civilization began, I asked why has so much of it been found within the last 150 years? And more importantly, can we learn something about entrepreneurship and innovation in the process?  When one hundred thousand prospectors stormed California in 1849, they quickly swallowed up all the surface gold in just two years. Thereafter, corporations, armed with new techniques and technologies as well as large sacks of cash, were able to get at gold no single person could get. Companies like Comstock mined at such a large scale, methods of squeezing out as much gold as possible from ore were profitable. Starting in the 1850s and never stopping, technology turned gold from an exotic wonder to an expensive commodity. Some of these technologies were hydraulic mining (using pressurized water to tear away soil), deep tunnel mining (using timbers to create the now-familiar “square” pattern that reinforces the mines), dynamite and a compressed air drill, saving the miners from back-breaking work. And while each of these new creations had their flaws and dangers, they were quickly replaced with safer, more effective technologies. For example, the compressed air drill was known as the widow-maker—because it spat back dust that often resulted in lung disease of the operator. The nickname became less accurate when a safer drill was introduced only a decade later.  In 1968, the federal government stopped regulating the price of gold ($35 an ounce), which skyrocketed shorter there after. In response to the deregulation, the technological surge was even more so, spawning new technologies in everything from computer programming to air-conditioning to non-verbal signals to new drills.   I pose this brief tangent into mining as just another example of the wonders of technology and free markets. Motivated by no one but themselves and prices, individual, autonomous people raised the living standard of everyone but not just adding new technologies that enhance our lives but by providing a valuable commodity that nations once started wars over. And for anyone that still considers corporations to be heartless entities living off the life blood of the worker and Mother Earth, consider this: as far back at the late 1800s—before OSHA, mind you—these big heartless corporations  forced their workers to take breaks  because the heat in the deep tunnels was so severe. How's that for the miracle of the free market?

      Happy Independence Day everyone! And as much as I love this country, I was reminded today of the limits of my admiration for a country that claims to adore the miracle of the free market. During the local festivities my family attends, I ran into my old high school social studies teacher, Jeff, who now works at a local public school. After catching up a bit, I told him I’m interested in teaching, to which he reminded me of two huge problems with the public education system.  The first is the firing problem. Jeff pointed out that the public schools have bad teachers in them, preventing newbies like me positions to could fill. I have no idea how common they are but the real point is how hard they are to fire. Jeff referenced the old saying by Louisiana Governor Edwin Washington Edwards that they only way he’d lose a race (or in this case get fired) is if he was found in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy. (Though he later lost to Buddy Roemer in 1987.) I can think of two main reasons for this structural problem. The first is one that I hope Mike will provide more concrete evidence for as it is more of his area: teacher unions. From what he’s told me (and this doesn’t surprise me at all) is that the unions make it incredibly hard to fire teachers. The other obstacle is a supply problem. The fact of the matter is that there are few eligible teachers at the high school level, especially for disciplines including biology, economics, math, foreign languages, physics and so on. Schools don’t want to fire teachers if they don’t think they can replace them. (I wish I asked Jeff why he thought it was so hard to fire teachers and I hope that once I give him the address of LLL, he’ll lend support to one of these theories or provide a new insight best accessible to those with the local, tacit knowledge of a public school teacher.)  While the teacher shortage is a real problem and legitimate grounds for keeping less than good teachers, what defenders of our public school system tend to ignore is that they are an author of their own problem. The second obstacle I’d face is my lack of a teaching certificate. Because I decided to major in political science and economics, I didn’t have time to get a certificate, a perquisite to teach in any Iowa public school. I question that claim I need documentation to prove I can teach. I’ve tutored students at the college (with notable success), taught friends in my spare time (with their gratuitous thanks) and lead numerous undergraduate class discussions in the areas of my expertise. My mother teaches college-level math so I have an experienced resource to call upon if I ever run into a problem I don’t know how to solve. Next semester, I’ll be a TA to an undergraduate economics course, organizing study sessions and grading their tests and homework. And the bottom line is, I’m a personable person and have taught many people many different things with compliments all around, which is more than I can say for some teachers and professors I’d had in my educational career. Requiring a teaching certificate is not only insufficient insurance against poor teachers, it prevents good teachers without “proof” from having the opportunity to instruct.  The state of our public school system is the result of a vicious circle. Parents and other voters want to guarantee good teachers so they require a certificate, which puts a strain on available teachers. This shortage forces schools to keep the instructors that got the certificate despite being poor at their job, which only encourages more regulation. But if we were to remove the requirement (as Illinois schools are slowly doing), there would be potentially good teachers to replace the bad. Will it be enough? It’s hard to tell, but there will certainly be more than before, and, as the bad ones are rooted out, there will be better ones, too.

      Apologies to all three of our readers for the lack of voice in the past several days but I’ve been quite busy reading  Salt: A World History , by Mark Kurlansky, among other slightly less interesting of activities.  I’m not kidding when I said that salt is interesting. Salt is one of the oldest commodities ever pursued, though it is one of the most abundant resources on the planet. Salt is needed to preserve food, create saltpeter, raise livestock, purify ore and make cheese. The Mormon Church drew much of its early revenue because it sold the salt its citizens extracted from the Great Salt Lake. Venice’s main source of prominence was its function as a trading center for salt. During the Civil War, saltworks was a main focus of attack a strategy that hamstrung the Confederates for the entire war. When the South surrendered, they requested provisions because Robert E. Lee’s soldiers hadn’t had anything to eat in two days.  There’s a hundred examples of salt-related  urlLink path dependence  in Salt but my favorite relates to the reason why I keep getting lost the moment I leave the interstate.  “Studying a road map of almost anywhere in North America, noting the whimsical nongeometric pattern of secondary roads, the local roads, the map reader could reasonably assume that the towns were places and interconnected haphazardly without any scheme or design. That is because the roads are simply widened footpaths and trails, and these trails were originally cut by animals looking for salt...The lick at the end of the road, because it had a salt supply, was a suitable place for a settlement.” –Mark Kurlansky,  Salt: A World History , page 200  Just chew on that for a while.  PS: Mike and I will be in LA for the HIS seminar all next week and will return to blogging on the 25th or so.

      Isn’t funny how crazy the free market can be sometimes? Yesterday’s Des Moines Register reported  urlLink one case  where those evil corporations that environmentalists often demonize are actually better for Mother Earth than self-sufficiency.  When you wash your car, you end up pouring thousands of chemicals into the sewer which, at least in Des Moines, doesn’t go to the water treatment plant. It leads to the rivers and streams. Even biodegradable soaps kill the fish and ruin the biosphere. BUT if you engage in the market and have someone wash your car professionally, the water is pumped to a treatment center where it is cleaned before being discharged into the environment.  Not willing to try to stop people from washing their own cars (or preventing popular fund raisers), environmentalists are leaning towards public education to solve the problem. I think that’s hilarious considering Iowa  urlLink just joined a law suit  with seven other states and New York City against five power companies because they’re contributing to global warming. Together, these five produce as much as ten percent of the nation’s carbon dioxide. The claim is these firms aren’t doing enough to ease over to cleaner sources of energy, like wind power.  Of course, making this change would increase the cost of energy, lessening consumption. Considering how important energy is in our lives, it seems logical to me that the electricity-intense activities easiest to substitute would be the first to go. Hmmmm. Could one of them be an expense involving a giant conveyor belt with a dozen spinning and washing apparatuses? Nah…  It looks like some environmentalists need a lesson in incentives.

      Sex is a wonderful thing. Some people say that the family is the foundation of civilization but I’m going to go with knocking boots. It’s one of the few things everyone wants (with very rare exceptions) and everyone enjoys (again, with very rare exceptions). It’s next to impossible to have a conversation without referring to it, volumes of text and countless hours of television are dedicated to it and it even has a few networks.  So why haven’t Republicans—typically the more troop-supporting of the two major parties—called for supplying our troops with this most basic of needs? I’m not sure, but at least  urlLink one group  is willing to rise to the call. Operation: Take One For The Country is an organization of fine women looking to send off our troops on a high note. (Insert your own joke about boosting morale here.) Just another example demonstrating that government programs just aren’t as intimate with the public’s needs as enterprising individuals.  Mad props to Ileana Cosaceanu for telling me about OTOFTC.

      I just got back from the IHS seminar in Los Angeles and it’s good to be home (sort of). As most of my fellow libertarians groped their way home, I spent another day with an old friend of mine, Seth, who lives in Pasadena. He had some interesting insights.  Los Angeles has state laws against cutting and saving places in line. You know they’re state laws because in every theme park there are big signs citing the legislation. Seth downplayed the laws, saying that you usually just get warnings but the practiced enforcement isn’t the core issue; it’s the potential enforcement. If there’s a law against something as harmless as cutting in line, that’s a gateway for police to abuse your rights. What happens when the public demands that the police “start doing more” to enforce crime? Cutting in line is something pretty easy to catch and issuing more fines and less warnings are not only good for the state budget but for state politics.   But that’s not the worst case scenario. Bureaucrats, police and judges are always under pressure to be hard on drugs. It’s pretty easy to claim people who cut in line tend to be the rebel rousers that are more likely to shoot up. A cavity search may not be standard procedure for the line lawless now, but that very real potential exists. &nbsp;California doesn’t just set the foundation for interfering with people’s civil rights; it likes screwing with economic ones, too. According to California State law, if a movie theater is in danger of going out of business, it gains exclusive rights to show certain movies, movies the theater gets to pick. This artificial market entity’s purpose is to try to prevent theaters from failing and it certainly works. LA is lousy with movie theaters. Personally, I’d like to see another Starbucks.

      Chris Rasmussen  urlLink asks  why libertarians don't have a patron saint.  The easy answer here would be that libertarians are too smart for that, or too academic--but I don't really believe that. My guess would be that libertarianism is far too fractured and divided to allow for a major icon of the movement to emerge. Many people would nominate Ayn Rand, just as many more would probably dissasociate themselves with any movement with her face on it (myself included) .  Additionally, the faces of every "radical political movement" tend to be the faces of people who acted in loud or violent ways; for example, Che Guevara, who Chris mentions. Most violent libertarians end up silently locked away.  UPDATE: My feeling is not that libertarians individually cannot have a patron saint--just look at the vast quantities of people who do little more than quote Hayek or Rand. It's that the movement itself inhibits the creation of a collective patron saint.  UPDATE 2: That's independent of us being evil.

      David and I think that the battle against bad economic analysis (like that employed by Mandelbrot) deserves a nice, pithy phrase. David has opened the dialogue with "The collective movements of the stars themselves are more predictable than the daily activities of a single housewife," which I think is too sexist to work with Joe and Jane Sixpack.  So the floor is open. Come up with a better phrase than David. The author of the best phrase/slogan/etc. will win a date with David Youngberg. Or, at least, win David's lifelong admiration.

      Wired Magazine is carrying an  urlLink open letter  from Benoît Mandelbrot (father of the fractal) to Alan Greenspan and Wall Street. In it, he suggests that any financial success anyone has had in the past, oh, decade, is a result of pure luck, rather than any actual financial management. He writes:  Fortunately, bankers and regulators now realize the system is flawed. The world's central banks have been pushing for more sophisticated risk models - but what they need is one that takes into account long-term dependency, or the tendency of bad news to come in waves.  Right. With all due respect to Mandelbrot, the market is not a fractal. Yes, it is a chaotic system, such that it is exceptionally sensitive to initial conditions. He, and all of the economic models he must have researched, do not account for the ability of random events to occur at random times. Such things are inherently incapable of being modeled. Such things do not exist in fractals.  He finishes:  If we can map the human genome, why can't we map how a man loses his livelihood? If millions can contribute a few cycles of their PCs to the search for a signal from outer space, why can't they join a coordinated search for patterns in financial markets?   Searching for patterns in financial markets is not analogous to mapping the human genome. A better analogy would be mapping the change of every genome over the course of the history of life on Earth and, of course, predicting what species will emerge 20 million years from today. The problem that Austrians face is explaining that the market can never be reduced to a few functions, and so long as the public is led to believe that economics is as deterministic as mathematics, we will continue to have mathematicians explaining the mystery of the market as if it were  urlLink SETI@Home .

      Today marks the  urlLink fifth annual tax-free weekend in Iowa , evidence that all people are libertarians at their core. Why? Because while every store has 50% off sales, none of them garner the response as much as shedding Iowa’s 7% sales tax for clothes and shoes costing less than $100. Here in Davenport, the response is messy and comparable to a strong Christmas weekend. People even come in from neighboring states to take advantage. (I’ll be braving the crowds tomorrow. Wish me luck.) Even the best store sales don’t generate this kind of response.  Granted, such sales only happen in one store while the tax-free weekend is state-wide but the average back-to-school shopper (the group the weekend is aimed to help) only spends $483 per household—that’s just $31.65 for taxes. Is that really comparable to 30, 40 or 50% off back to school sales that are just weeks away? Doubtful. In Moline, a neighboring city in Illinois, many stores have 7% off sales to try to keep people in the state. But every year I see a lot of Illinois plates in the mall parking lot.  Aside from all the free media the weekend generates, I think people also get a bit of joy out of paying for something without paying taxes. I think everyone likes the idea of having a transaction with as little government as possible. I think everyone, in their heart of hearts, is a libertarian.

      I added Haloscan so that we could start using Trackback. Unfortunately, I didn't think about what this would do to our comments sections.  Comments from old posts have NOT been deleted. They're just sort of hidden. Click on the time of a given post to see what the old comments were.  Very sorry about the mistake.  UPDATE: Problem fixed. I prefer the Blogger Comments over the Haloscan comments. But we now have Trackback, for those many bloggers out there who want to link to us...  UPDATE AGAIN: It looked like the problem still existed to me, so I spent half an hour trying everything I could to fix the template. Nothing worked until I thought to hit refresh. What does this have to do with Austrian? Clearly, this was a novel jump to a new solution.

      I have an uncle that hunts. Whenever he’s in Iowa, he sets aside time to go out into the wilderness and kill things. He even brings his hunting dog. Shooting animals is not something that catches my fancy but I never had a problem with it until I learned I was  urlLink paying for it .  The Conservation Reserve Program is a federal program that pays farms not to farm on land the government thinks is environmentally sensitive. This land is then used as natural habitat for various animals, including the popular game bird, the northern bobwhite quail. Not only that, President Bush is looking to add to the acreage eligible for the program.  This policy is so twisted, so backward, so ridiculous, it’s almost overwhelming to even list why. First, I’m told subsidizing farmers is a good thing because people should have cheap food (a tortuous argument itself because the food is actually more expensive; it’s just paid for twice). Then, more taxpayer money is spent to pay farmers not to produce which, of course, makes food even more costly. The eligible lands for this program are determined by the Department of Agriculture, an apparently omnipresent part of our government that knows which tracks of land are the most environmentally valuable (whatever that means). Finally, the whole program is justified by protecting wildlife which the government then charges people to kill. At least they aren’t being paid. Not yet, anyway.  Wouldn’t it make more sense to pull away so individuals have an incentive to buy this land and then charge hunters to hunt on it? Not only would taxpayers not be charged for an activity only a handful of Americans participate in, these entrepreneurs and farmers would be in a far better position to assess the value of this land. Of course, the twisted bureaucracy and backward incentives the government offers makes this solution highly unlikely. It’s enough to make me wish I owned a gun, but not one for hunting.

      A week ago,  urlLink allegations  surfaced that at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport (the fifth-busiest in the United States), security staff deliberately understaffed security screening checkpoints to increase the wait time for passengers. Why? So they had a better reason to ask for additional funding from the federal government. What better excuse to ask for additional cash to buy more screeners than because the fifth-busiest airport has the longest wait times in the nation?  Of course, TSA and Homeland Security officials  urlLink deny  the allegations. I genuinely believe there may be truth to them, but I would not know how to go about proving that with certainty. Either way, we are left with a question about the incentive structure here. When airports that do a poor job of being efficient and effective, the feds throw more money at them to hire more people. Now, the answer most readers of this blog will throw out is that we need to privatize the entire system of airport security. I think it's an idea worthy of exploration, but especially now, it's not exactly an idea that will fly with Joe Sixpack.  Is there a way to keep the government involved and still have a reasonable incentive structure? I cannot imagine rewards based on weapons or terrorists caught; I imagine the definition of weapon becoming very loosely defined and airports being showered with additional money for a bucket full of knitting needles. Readers? Is there an answer?

      Under some gentle prodding (read: death threats) from Mr. Youngberg, this is my first post in a long while. I thought I'd start it off with some more of Glenwatch, where David and I comment on everything Glen Whitman says.  This  urlLink post  by Glen tries to analyze the recent terror alerts in New York, etc. in game theory terms. A few commenters have beaten me to the suggestion that any game of feint and counter-feint can be fundamentally reduced to the Sicilian-Westley game of The Princess Bride. For any of you unaware of it, the protagonist, Westley, offers the Sicilian a game: he will fill two glasses with wine and poison one. The Sicilian will choose one cup and drink from it, and Westley the other. The loser will die, and the winner will get the girl.  The Sicilian accepts, and spends the rest of the scene contemplating out loud every possible depth and layer of the choice of the cup. Finally, he chooses a cup, and drinks with confidence. He promptly dies, and Westley reveals that it was a trick: both cups were poisoned, and Westley was immune to that particular poison.  What's the lesson? Sometimes there is a choice C that the other player has not let you know about. So I offer a different suggestion about the terrorist alerts. The terrorists already did what they wanted to do: get the government in a public guessing game about which feint or counter-feint will be used. There's no need to actually act further than that, especially with how public this discussion has been.

      My hometown of Davenport, Iowa was blessed today by two presidential candidates, immediately accompanied by  urlLink three bank robberies . Some think these robberies were planned to coincide with the campaigning because the police would be so busy with security.  It’s so appropriate that these robberies took place a couple of days after I repeated Glen Whitman’s two principles of economics (incentives matter and there’s no such thing as a free lunch) because even here, economics can be learned. People not versed in Glen’s first principle might be surprised to learn that initial reports suggest these robberies were independent from one another. In fact,  urlLink Police Chief Bladel  doesn’t think two of the robberies were planned. Individuals, acting on personal knowledge to achieve a given ends, pursued an activity they thought would yield the best results. What a novel idea. Considering the robberies had a 66% success rate thus far (one suspect was captured), they did a pretty good job. As the costs fall, the amount of the activity increases. Incentives matter.  But the second rule is more interesting. According to Lt. Don Gano the extra security measures did not interfere with police coverage because, among other reasons, officers worked overtime. I don’t know what magical world Lt. Gano lives in but when you have fewer police on patrol, the coverage worsens. When you have officers pulling extra shifts to pick up the slack, the quality of each shift inevitably goes down. The police are less alert, less reactive, possibly annoyed and taking frequent breaks for caffeine jumps. While these deficiencies may be a minor problem, when you’re looking for a suspicious-looking vehicle/person or there’s an APB with nothing but a vague description as a lead, that minor problem can make all the difference in the world. Of all people I would think that a police officer would understand that. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.

       A recent article by  urlLink Tim Worstall at Tech Central Station  reminded me of one of Prof. Glen Whitman’s lessons from the IHS seminar I attended last month. The article reiterates Glen’s  urlLink “two things” about economics . All you really need to know about economics is 1) Incentive matter and 2) There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Everything else is either BS or drawn from those two core principles.  In Glen’s original article about the two things, he requests that everyone defines the two things that’s needed for their area of expertise. With economics already covered, I turned to my other major from college: politics. The two rules of politics are 1) Incentives matter, but winning is the only one that counts and 2) There’s no such thing as a free lunch but saying otherwise will help you win.    Originally, I wrote it as a joke. But considering President Bush’s obsession with cutting taxes while inflating the government bureaucracy, John Kerry’s popular pledge to raise the minimum wage and the fact that virtually every politician’s celebrated promises are also economically backwards, there might be more truth to the two things than I thought. I believe every challenge can be overcome and every problem has a solution but if the incentive structure of politics is truly so backwards, how can we feasibly correct it?

       Libertarians love freedom. We the opportunity and novelty inherent in the free mind. We love the idea that the state shouldn’t tell us what to do or to think or to buy. We the fact that people can voice any opinion in a free society, even if we don’t always like it. But how far should we defend freedom? As libertarians, should we tolerate racism in our own ideology?  This is the conversation  urlLink Steve Horwitz  and I were having via e-mail last week. His argument is certainly makes sense. Libertarians aren’t rulers of a state and we have the right to say who we identify with. After all, racism, sexism, homophobia and other eighteen century social norms are completely contrary to everything libertarianism stands for. If we don’t reject these people with every breath of our voice, we run the risk of such ideologies defining libertarianism in the minds of the general public. We should vehemently denounce them as the hypocrites they are and cut all ties to them.  But, I argue, doesn’t that discredit us as defenders of free choice/thought/association? I don’t want bigots to call themselves libertarians and claiming to be both is, of course, a contradiction in terms. But the moment we shove “them” aside and claim “they” have nothing to contribute to the ideology not only discredits our celebration of freedom, but we also miss the opportunity to grasp what small insight they may come up with. As for the realm of public opinion, people aren’t stupid and they’ll notice that a libertarian racist is a contradiction in terms. At the very least, they’ll start asking questions and isn’t that what we want people to do in the first place?  This article, more than any other, demands commentary. Should libertarians completely detach ourselves from hate and idiocy or do we recognize them as the inevitable result of a freedom-loving ideology?  PS. I sent this to Steve for his input and he had a few comments. I made some changes in respect to his criticism and am posting the rest for mass consumption.  Steve wrote,  “I never said they have *nothing* to contribute to our views. I think some do. But the gains are not worth the costs. Your argument above suggest that any negative effects on libertarians from inclusion are worth the potential small benefits that come from their possible contributions, however small.  That's a very uneconomic way of thinking about it, isn't it? ;)  Since when do we engage in behavior just because the benefits are positive if the costs are greater?”  “Sorry, but [the public] won't [ask questions]. It will confirm EVERYTHING they wrongly believe about us. For example, "Ah-ha! I told you they opposed minimum wage laws because they want to keep poor black folks down. Sure they said it would help, but now we know the real deal when we read about them defending the Confederacy." Same with gender issues, etc. To me, associating with racists absolutely guts our ability to distinguish ourselves from conservatives.  For me, that's a very high value.”   PSS. Of course, since this is my article I get last word. When it comes to ideas I prefer to err on the side of optimism. One really good idea is worth thousands of bad ones because that one good one will stand for all time. As for public opinion, I can definitely imagine the scenario presented but the core problem here isn’t just the public…it’s the poor state of the mass media. But that’s really a separate discussion.

      Politicians love talking about America needing a “stable economy.” And it’s true: a stable economy—as in one that rests on a reliable foundation of the rule of law, safety, free-flowing information and other wide sweeping institutions—is an economy where people can confidently build personal and physical infrastructure.  But politicians take it several steps farther, using the mantra of a “stable economy” to justify political action in places where not only the state has no business being, but actually makes the economy less stable. The  urlLink Des Moines Register  reported Thursday that Iowa community colleges are drastically raising tuition because the state budget is strained beyond measure.  It never fails to amaze me when people think that the state is more reliable than the market. Policies and politics lack the autonomy of the market. The federal, state and municipal governments do a great deal (most of it unnecessary and counterproductive) and when one department wants more money, it has to come from somewhere. But changes in allocation aren’t determined by the people, like in a market economy; it’s made by politicians looking to get re-elected and interest group trying to push their version of the truth onto everyone else.  All educational institutions raise their tuition, but these are based on real economic factors, not the whims and sudden shifts in the political landscape. When a bureaucracy is put in place, it’s participants are the only ones that are a position to properly assess its effectiveness. And like a private monopoly, they lack the incentive to change or to acknowledge their shortcomings. Gene Garner, executive director of the Iowa Association of Community College Trustees, cites low residential taxes, not political realities, as the source of the budget woes. No one should be surprised he likes “stability.”

      Yesterday I posted an article questioning NASA’s role as a government entity as NASA recently released pictures it took of Saturn’s rings. I implied that NASA’s return on an investment of billions of dollars wasn’t worth it. My criticism of the Space Agency was met with a few comments, two of which challenged my conclusion, both of which were Anonymous.  The second Anonymous not only had the longer and more involving argument, s/he also built off the previous comment which was “the billions of dollars we spent on pure scientific endeavour probably would have gone to bloated defense programs, or something else you libertarian-types would have found equally objectionable.” It’s true that “us libertarian-types” do find a great deal of government spending objectionable for a very basic reason: governments have a hard time assessing value. I can illustrate why by exploring what really would happen if NASA was disbanded.  Let’s suppose that there’s a paradigm shift in the minds of the people and/or our congressional leaders. It’s decided that NASA just isn’t worth the money and is dicountinued, freeing up billions of dollars in the federal budget every year. Like what happened when the government ran a surplus four years ago, everyone has a different take on what they should spend the money on. Some groups will want tax cuts, some will want to pay back the deficit, some will want more public lands, some for education, some for health care, some for things we couldn’t possibly imagine and, yes, some for defense. Most likely the billions will be split between all these interest groups based on what is politically feasible. And that’s the point. Politicans make their descions based on politics, not economics. While the vast majority of them are good intentioned, they are ultimately misguided because the lack the knowledge, rationality, power and incentive to make decisions that help the most people. (I know, dear reader, that you might have a problem with me claiming what’s economic is also best for society as a whole but trust me, it’s true. Explaining why is a whole other article.) My favorite examples of politics over economics are farm subsidies, tariffs, immigration laws and, of course, NASA. All of these concentrate benefits to handful of citizens while punishing the rest of society.  The second Anonymous continues his/her argument with the three following assumptions: space has zero profit potential, pure knowledge has zero profit potential but is more valuable than knowledge for an applied purpose and private firms  cannot do a better job at space exploration than governments. Let me address these one at a time.  According to Anonymous, “[i]t isn't the lack of relevance or lack of technology that keeps the private sector out of space science, it's the complete lack of revenue.” That’s flatly untrue. It really is the lack of technology that keeps the private sector out of space (until recently). The widespread interest in the  urlLink X Prize  and the attempt by former pop singer Lance Bass to travel into space demonstrates that traveling to space could be very profitable. True, right now regular travel to space is economically unfeasible but its feasiblity may be just around the corner. Traveling to space is a really cool idea and people will pay for it, as they pay to travel to the most isolated places on earth. Just as the Wright Brothers thought widespread airtravel was a fool’s fancy and IBM’s top brass thought no private person would want a computer (let alone be able to afford one), declaring that privatized space travel is impossible merely sets one up to be embarassed in twenty or thirty years. Even if we set aside tourism, there’s still several different possiblities for profitablity, most of which we can’t envision because we lack the knowledge and incentive to really sit down and be creative enough to think of them. But if you want an inkling, two possiblities are low-gravity manufacturing and asteriod mining (something environmentalists should be happy about).  Anonymous’s implication that pursuing knowledge for its own sake is somehow better than researching for profit lacks cohesion. Discovery is a wonderful, powerful thing and it doesn’t become less so if the scientist/explorer/engineer learns something that’s profitable. Those people aren’t worth less, either. Drawing the line between knowledge for knowledge’s sake and knowledge for profit’s sake is harder than one may think. Anonymous asks, “how would you plan to profit from uncovering the origins of the solar system?” S/he is not the only person that finds “unappliable” knowledge interesting. Millions of people visit musuems ranging from the Air and Space Museum to dinosaur parks to arecehological sites every year and they are willing to drop donations and/or pay for it, too. The success of the History and Discovery channels, as well as TLC turn so called knowledge for knowledge sake into profitable applications. Pure knowledge is really interesting, especially when we are discussing something as powerful and romantic as the origins of the universe.  Anonymous claims “a probe from a private company wouldn’t be able to get there any faster,” suggesting that government-funded space travel is the best people can do. But if there are incentives, like the incentives I suggest above, competeing firms can do amazing things. Individuals and private companies disproved the pessimitic claims of the Wright Brothers and IBM, giants in their respective fields. X Prize contenders created new, more powerful rocket fuels, self-learning software and a new rocket engine, as well as other creations. Because there are many autnomous groups pursuing the same goal, the full range of possiblities can be explored at the same time with no coersive costs to the average person.  While Anonymous was correct when s/he said that knowledge, not pictures, was the most important part of craft, assuming that knowledge is worth “billions and billions” illustrates my point. I think the knowledge is worth significantly less than that. Some one else might think it’s worth more. Who’s right? No one knows because value is determined through the collective action of millions of people, not by interest groups or governments. Only by setting the process to a market environment can society discover how much the data is worth. And when it comes to discovery, I’m sure everyone, especially Anonymous, can appreciate the process.

      Mike recently posted about the wonder of Saturn’s rings and how their pictures shake his libertarian foundation. They are nice and it is inspiring that we have those pictures but it also illustrates how pretty things can distract even the keenest of minds.  The pictures of Saturn’s rings costed billions of dollars, billions that could have been spent on something else and offered more than a nice-looking distraction. It also took years for the probe to reach that far; the people that monitored the probe could have done something more productive. Give me some paint and a brush and I could have a similar picture in far less time with far less money.  If Mike really wants genuine Saturn pictures, he and everyone that shares his desire should pay for it like they pay for movies. While it would be expensive, the competition between firms would lower the cost. Centuries ago, painters would travel to the frontier and reproduce images of the natural landscape which they would sell to wealthy patrons. Now those pictures are available at every discount decorating store in the country. With current technology, however, that kind of firm probably won’t exist, saying those images just aren’t worth it. I like those pictures too, but not for that price.

      John Stossel spoke at a  urlLink YAF  conference Tuesday. I caught the last bit of it on CSPAN, enough time to watch to young conservatives ask excellent questions. A young woman from a right to life organization asked John about the libertarian stance on abortion, the subject of which libertarians are about as divided as the country in general. John was similarly on the fence, though at the time he said that abortions should be illegal after five months of pregnancy.  What concerned me is the woman’s use of popular spin tricks to support her anti-abortion position. Most notably, she said there’s a “huge body of scientific evidence” that illustrates life begins at conception. Citing vauge scientific support is a common tool to rally people to your cuase while avoiding the pesky need for hard facts. These tactics are rare at libertarian-leaning conferences because they are rarely covered by the media (thus not as subject to politics) and participants are genuinely interested in honest debate, not pushing an ideology. Why was abortion an exception? Abortion is what political scientists call a “wedge issue,” meaning it will drive a wedge between people almost all the time. Individuals will side with a candidate or policy based solely on their position one abortion (irresponsible logic in itself). There’s even a Seinfeld episode where Elaine stops dating an excellent guy simply because he’s anti-abortion. Even more amazing is that’s perfectly believable.  When it comes to abortion, I prefer to leave it in the hands of philosophers and families rather than politicians and bureaucrats; it’s ultimately a question of the origin of consciousness. But I’m not sure about my stance. I have no idea when sentient life begins…no one does. Anyone who claims otherwise is either a liar or God, and God’s probably too busy to talk to you. What’s needed is an open and honest discussion about abortion, one that spans every corner of the country involving family, friends and neighbors, not political elites who are too afraid to concede even the most obvious point. That way, we might actually make some progress.  So how do we get this great debate? Remember when I said that abortion is a “wedge issue?” If the same wedge issue comes up enough, a gap forms between people. They don’t associate with one another, they demonize the “other side,” and they certainly don’t have open, honest and decentralized debates. The first step is bridging that gap so people will be willing to talk to each other and that requires changing the language behind the debate. As it stands, you are either pro-choice or pro-life, implicitly saying that people who disagree with you are either anti-choice or anti-life. What an awful thing to imply. One suggests that someone is a tyrant while the other says someone is a murderer (language that’s very close to the actual attack words used by either side). If we are to have an open, honest and decentralized discussion about abortion we need to stop calling each other names. It’s not that hard. Notice in this post I use the terms anti-abortion and pro-abortion. The only way to bridge the gap between these people is to stop name calling, spinning and posturing and start listening.

         I have just come from watching the new feature film  The Bourne Supremacy .    Not bad for an action flick, but lacking for plot.    Or maybe it was just the Matt Damon thing, I’m not completely sure.                        What, upon reflection, strikes me about the movie and others like it is how we (the American public) buy into the plot.    A dark, secret government agency does really bad things that even  it’s  not supposed to do.    In this case, the CIA creates black ops assassins who go rouge.    It’s a pretty old and tired mantra, and yet you can sell it.    Why?    Maybe it’s because we all know that this is what the government does.    Of course, I don’t mean the whole government – that would be silly.    But deep down in our psyche, we know that there are secretive agencies that deal in dirty work of various kinds; and our imaginations are not very heavily taxed to follow that line of logic to its inevitable conclusion.    Which is to say that the viewing public accepts that these are aspects of our government, however limited in scope they may believe them to be.     And, for the most part, we seem to be okay with it.    After all, shows like  The Agency  seem to put a very “this is necessary” and “for the good of the country” and “to make you safer” spin on things.       You know, it very well may be.    I’m not really privy to the kinds of information that the spooky folks trade in and so I can only speculate about it.    But ultimately I am, as Mr. Youngberg writes, not anti-government, just distrustful of it.    Specifically, d istrustful of what happens when power and human nature collide; because inevitably you end up with a story like  Bourne  that isn’t quite as fictional as we might like it to be; where human nature, taking its inevitable course, enters into personal greed or avarice or blackmail or whatever.    It gives way to an abuse of the power and trust bestowed upon those who wield it.                   You know, in principle I don’t oppose secret ops (I know that I will run afoul of some of my libertarian friends out there by saying this).    I recognize that in a complex and dangerous world there are probably times and places where the long arm of law and order doesn’t quite reach, and that one needs to be prepared for those times.    But the potential for abuse is ever-present as long as laws like the Patriot Act shield these kinds of super-secret activities from any kind of real Congressional or judicial oversight.  And if those secret ops begin substituting for traditional police action, and operating outside our system of public justice with men in black masks abducting and survelling and whatever else right here in our own homes and on our own streets, then we have a serious problem.                  The art of war may continue to depend on secrecy, and I cannot pretend that this is not the case.     So I grugingly and compliticly nod my head to the on-going existence of this kind of thing.  But our form of government is not particularly well suited to it, and should it get out of hand, it will not long breathe under its smother.    It is an uneasy balance and I constantly pray that there are true patriots, men who appreciate the enormous responsibility of freedom, who weigh in the scales the actions they take; because this is a high-stakes game we’re committed to and there isn’t much room for error.              ****************************************************     Sorry for the bad timing, but I too will be going on a brief respite.    Construction has attacked our house and we just can’t take the pounding anymore.    We’ll be vacationing far from the reaches of technology for the weekend.    I’ll resume my contributions, assuming Mike hasn’t decided to boot me out the door, when I return.    Until then, take care and God bless.     ****************************************************

      Matt Yglesias  urlLink puts rather succinctly  why I am still a registered Democrat:  [I] see no reason to believe that the policy program of the Republican Party is more conducive to growth than that of the Democratic Party. On the whole, I would argue that the reverse is true. . Most prominently, though, there are an awful lot of pro-growth reforms (especially with regard to the tax code) that  neither  party supports in practice, both organizations being essentially brokers for a variety of interest groups none of which are especially interest in doing the heavy lifting that would be involved in ironing out the wrinkles there. I think this fits well with our earlier discussion. The Republicans constantly frame themselves as the party of economic growth and freedom. They build the argument on issues of the marginal tax rate and hardly anything else. I'm thinking of organizations like  urlLink Club for Growth  here. I don't think they publicize any issues besides taxes. They then proceed to push many anti-growth and anti-freedom policies, like expanded tariffs, quotas,  urlLink limits on scientific research , etc. etc.  Fundamentally, when either party's policy is beneficial for economic growth, it is a positive side effect, not a genuine principle.. I just think that the Clintonian argument for free trade (that it makes people free) is less likely to make an abrupt change than the Bush argument for free trade (that it makes us richer). Libertarians should be careful how they vote ( urlLink if they even vote at all ). Neither side is going to be very good for growth.  [warning: I'm far from objective here; I cannot stand Bush.]

         It is plainly clear that Mr. Mills wishes to turn his soul over to eternal damnation.    Mr. Youngberg knows it, I know it, Ayn Rand knows it, we ALL know it.    Or so it might seem.                  What I do recognize is that idealism can affect fanaticism, and that is as true of libertarians as for anyone else.    We libertarians would like to believe that this kind of firebrand dogmatic ranting is the exclusive purview of those folks out at the Ayn Rand Cult of Vilified Altruism.    Sadly, it’s not.                  Mike is absolutely correct in his observation that libertarians are bad at what the movie  What About Bob  called “baby steps.”    Suggest such a small, concessionary step and immediately the libertarian zealots will rise to heckle, chastise, and ridicule you; and call you a traitor to the movement.    But what movement?    Hell, I can’t even tell you who the libertarian candidate for president this year is!    Maybe that means that, like Mr. Mills, I’m not a true libertarian either.                  CATO seems to understand this need to affect libertarian change within the system by helping to shape public policy step by step, and line by line.    Granted, as libertarian idealists, we probably believe that there shouldn’t be much of a public policy to begin with.    But acknowledging that, in fact, huge pubic policy movements have long been underway in this country, CATO does what it can to minimize the negative effects that regulation, legal reform, and whatever else the government tinkers with.    If CATO hadn’t been willing to work within the system all these years, it would not have garnered the kind of influence and standing within government and public policy circles that it has.    But maybe that means that the folks at CATO aren’t true libertarians either.              When our political philosophy takes on a religious fervor, then we really need to ask ourselves where that leads.    Will we resort to conversion by the sword?    Will we undertake an Inquisition of our own to root out the Mr. Mills of this world in the name of saving their soul from a socialist hell?    Because that is the  reductio ad absurdum  of this line of thinking, and way too many of us libertarians are thinking this way.    Passion is helpful when it is channeled onto canvas, through violin, or in the bedroom.    It can be most unhelpful and obstructive if it steals away a healthful equilibrium.    Not to mention that it sways no one to our way of thinking.    Who are the folks who are true libertarians?    It is people like Mr. Mills who already know that answer.

      Tyler Cowen writes  urlLink here  that  There are few movies that accurately illustrate market economics and fewer yet that show a good understanding of the theory of comparative advantage. This is one of them, and it can be viewed as a truly    libertarian  film. [emphasis mine] This is all well and good until he also mentions that the Mexican government subsidized the movie.

      I suppose it is unfair to have a whole discussion on the blog about an unpublished e-mail, but David started it! I think his goal is to make me blog more often, the trickster.  David misunderstands my complaint. It is not that libertarians resort to the market as the solution for everything [it can be], but the degree to which they do. When was the last time you heard the libertarian party suggest moderate privatization? How many of the bloggers on our blogroll have ever suggested that maybe state control needs to be changed in a delicate way? Granted, when someone thinks the entire system is corrupt, it can be a valid argument to suggest that nothing but a complete removal of the entire system will do.  But how many non-libertarians are going to listen to that argument? If the capitalist in the corner could be replaced with a parrot quoting Hayek, why would anyone bother inviting him to the table? Why should they? My complaint is that the entire movement shoots itself in the foot by being unwilling to compromise by taking things slowly. Try telling a smoker he should quit smoking cold turkey. You'll get about the same response as telling the average American that the government should leave everyone alone in the (market/bedroom/choose your partisan issue).

      I have been doing some writing on the Google IPO (more on that later), which reminded me of how much Google demonstrates a number of things that Austrians have believed for a long time. I have started using this example to illustrate Austrian principles, to some success.  Clearly, with such a vast amount of data out there on the internet (isn't it something like a few thousand pecobytes?), no single human could possibly know everything that is out there. Enter the search engine, a way to connect viewer with website. In the early days of the search engine, information was "searched" by one or a combination of two methods. Most search engines were no more than a glorified F4 button. They worked no differently than search in Word or a web browser. Others would have a team of people compiling sites and categorizing them by topic, etc. Yahoo! started off with an engine that used some aspects of both, but entrepreneurs quickly realized that the only thing needed to get a top result on a search engine was to put the important words down as many times as possible. The computer would just assume that a high frequency of a word would imply a site is relevant to that word. Since Yahoo's algorithm assumed that any webpage with the word insurance must be relevant to a search on insurance, an insurance company would be wise to have a part of the page that just included the word a few hundred times in size 1 font. Categories were inefficient as well. How do we place the site that includes both Metallica lyrics and information on gardening in the bay area?  We can compare this method to rough attempts by the government to understand the market. Plenty of government agencies try to monitor as much economic activity as possible, and are understandably overwhelmed. Try looking at a CPI report on the item level. And merely allowing sites to self-identify creates a horrible incentive structure. A website would succeed in the early Yahoo! era not by being a quality website, but by tricking the algorithms. Similarly, we see plenty of industries rewarded for going through the motions of obeying various regulations.  Enter Google. Google brings to the table two now-obvious insights. First, that the internet is not a collection of independent sites, but a vast community of interconnected and interdependent information. Second, that the community understands itself better than any computer could. Roughly, Google determines the relevance of a given site to a given phrase not by the incidence of that phrase on the page, but by the incidence of the phrase in reference to that site. I know much better which websites are relevant to Austrian Economics, because I actually read them. Thus, Google looks at what amounts to price signals on the internet: the ever-important link. Additionally, links from a given page carry weight. We here at Law, Legislation, and Lunacy, add very little to the strength of Glen Whitman's blog in Google's eyes because we have a relatively low status on the web. Meanwhile, Volokh linking to him boosts him rather quickly, as they have themselves an immense number of websites linking to them.  Thus, the Google algorithm becomes a market process. The entire algorithm is recursive; my linking to you boosts the strength of your linking to me, and so on. Information is distributed efficiently, because the algorithm genuinely understands the importance of local knowledge. Now if we could only get it to grasp the value of tacit knowledge (i.e. that some of us can blog with less effort than others), we would have the perfect Austrian solution.  Full Disclosure: Blogger is owned by Google, so we are broadcasting these views to you on Google's dime. I would be quite happy to continue evangelizing for Google if they were to send me an  urlLink offer.

      A few years ago, my hometown of Davenport, Iowa received something wonderful, something I never thought we would get: our first Home Depot. Because the city finally grew to a large enough size, the Home Depot Corporation finally decided to build a store in the area. It was a glorious day.  Surprisingly, there are people that criticize Home Depot offering do-it-yourselfers rock bottom prices and quality equipment. Al Norton heads an attack against sprawl—cheap large scale development Home Depot and Wal-Mart are famous for. Norton dubs distaste for Home Depot as the “orange wars” in reference to the chain’s signature color. His main criticisms are 1) Home Depot isn’t nice enough to its employees, 2) Home Depot wins in a competitive market and 3) Home Depot stores are ugly.  Not surprisingly, these are the same criticisms Norton uses against Wal-Mart, another fabulous store. Reality renders these attacks irrelevant. No one forces anyone to work or shop at discount stores. If they require their employees to shave or if they offer lower prices, it’s none of our business to declare that “right” or “wrong.” It’s the same reasoning with the look of the building. Ascetics are a matter of opinion and even if they truly are ugly, that’s the price of low prices. Like most people in the world, I’m on a fixed budget and if going to an unsightly place saves me money, that’s fine. The success of the discount stores demonstrates that people are willing to tolerate unattractive buildings.  Home Depot and Wal-Mart provide a service to the economy. The poorest people in the country shop at these stores and because of the “evil” corporate practices, the lower class is better off. They can afford more, have a higher standard of living and employ more people, not just at the retail outlets, but through the products they buy. Wal-Mart saved people in small towns billions of dollars, billions of dollars these people spend on other things. Norton’s counterargument is that the number is a lie but his only evidence is a random quote from, Tom Coughlin, Executive Vice President of Operations: "At Wal-Mart, we make dust. Our competitors eat dust." That’s just not good enough.  In a world without Wal-Marts or Home Depots, people are poorer. Yes, there are minorities that are better off—small businesses—but the society as a whole is less prosperous. I’ve often said that the economy is more democratic than democracy. In a democracy, if 49% of the people want a candidate, they don’t get anything. But if just a handful of individuals want a product, they get it. Patrons of sprawl vote with their dollars. Demonizing them and the institutions that offer the option is not only poor economics, it’s undemocratic.

      Mike sent me an e-mail last week confessing why he doesn’t define himself as a true libertarian. Libertarians rely too much on the market. Just as a communist’s answer to anything is government power or a Starfleet officer’s best problem solver is the deflector (seriously, watch any series of Star Trek; the deflector can do anything), libertarians’ knee-jerk answer to all of the world’s problems is market activity.  On some level, I share Mike’s concern. All of us spent our adult lives hearing dogmatic mantras of one type or another being shoved down our throats. Real estate investment is a sure thing. Peace is the only path to happiness. God is infinite and far-reaching. Black goes with everything. It’s a simplistic formula that’s easy to understand and adopt. It also tends to be wrong. Relying too much on any paradigm screws up your perception of the world and many libertarians are in danger of draping society in black.  That being said, let’s take a moment and remember that some paradigms are better than others. Black goes with a lot more than red; markets accomplish a lot more than governments. That’s what experience teaches us. Markets manage knowledge better. They are more adaptable. More forward looking. More democratic. While the individuals only care about themselves (though even this isn’t true), the market as a whole ends up caring for everyone. Some rules of thumb are better than others.  But only the most radical libertarians rely on markets for everything. And Soviet Russia wasn’t nearly as controlling as, say,  1984 . Most everyone acknowledges that there needs to be some mix between the two, just as people who wear only black are as unfashionable as those that wear only red. A combination is always the better solution.  Mike expressed concern because a libertarian’s faith in the market is easily seen as dogmatic and dumb. People think we dress only in black and are arrogant enough to believe that’s all we need. If we are to convince critics and skeptics to dip their toe in the market, we have to remind them we like to wear red. The state has its place and that place is giant and enormous and powerful. We don’t hate government, we just distrust it.

      I had no idea our first lady could see the future.  Mrs. Bush  urlLink imprecated supporters of stem cell research  at the Pennsylvania Medical Society last week. Said she, "but I know that embryonic stem cell research is very preliminary right now and the implication that cures for Alzheimer's are around the corner is just not right and it's really not fair to people who are watching a loved one suffer with this disease."  For the record, the first lady is not a doctor, a biologist or any capacity a legitimate authority on the matter. So the only way that she could possibly know that a cure isn’t “just around the corner” (a phrase that can mean anything from a few days to a decade) is if she knows when it will happen.  People, especially politicians, like to pretend they are the utmost authority on everything. That’s why depending on them for research allocation (or almost any allocation) is inherently dangerous. One administration thinks an idea is golden, so they fund it. Then the funding gutted in favor of something else in the next administration. Then it’s re-packaged in yet another administration. Laura Bush’s comment, which was a response against the 58 senators requesting the President to endorse removing stem cell research barriers, demonstrates why research should be done by individuals and private firms. When governments use everyone’s money, it gives anyone the chance to bring up whatever argument they want.

          Here are two articles that just make you wonder what it is that journalists do these days.    First, is the happy pronouncement that Paris Hilton’s lost  urlLink chihuahua  has been found.    Well, thank God for that.    It’s not that I don’t think that people appreciate their pets, but I do have to wonder why it made national news.    It is reasonably clear that our young vixen Ms. Hilton is a bit of a publicity junky.    And I certainly don’t mind her parading her scantily clad self about for public consumption.    But one has to assume that an opportunity cost was paid here; that some other news story was bumped for this.    God help me, I can’t imagine what that would be.                   At least I know it wasn’t the  urlLink Pig Riot .    Reuters reports that a truck carrying a shit-load (can I say that on this blog?) of pigs fell over and spilled the oinking menace onto the road.    Apparently it caused quite the stir what with cars swerving to avoid the angry pigs.    If only the Malaysian government had been more like New York, and thought to pay off the rioters, say with coupon discounts at the local Muslim no-pork bazaar.    They might safely have avoided the riot.

             Much ado has been made about hurricanes over the last few days, so I thought I’d throw out another, somewhat more permanent weather feature: winter.    Scientists know that over the course of hundreds of years, the earth goes through periodic warming and cooling periods.    For example, we know that Great Britain once had tropical forests sometime during the last 2000 years.                  It’s not a real exact science, but with the occasional shifts in earth’s polarity, subtle shifts of the planetary axis, greater or fewer numbers of sunspots, and other factors all come to bear on whether or not we have ice or water.    As you might have inferred, this is the kind of change that occurs over hundreds, if not thousands of years; is entirely natural; and happened long before mankind began burning fossil fuels.                  Try and tell this to the Europeans.    Reuters  urlLink reports  today that European winters should be all gone by 2080.    This, the report notes, will be especially bad for the elderly and the infirm.    I suppose they will just have to winter in Russia to find more comfortable conditions.    The report mentions the usual suspect – greenhouse gases – and cites that the report expects global temperatures to rise between 3 and 10 degrees over the next century.    The report concludes that Europe, with its glacier mountains and below-sea-level lowland countries (alla The Netherlands and Belgium), will be hardest hit.              Now, to start with, 3-10 seems like a wide margin of error.    It suggests to me that someone is just guessing.    I can lick my finger and put it to the wind and come up with that kind of temperature range.    Can you imagine the TV weatherman coming on with the forecast and saying, “Today it will be between 80 and 90 degrees.”    He would be fired.              But I cannot help thinking that the just sounds a bit over the top; a bit apocalyptic if you will.    Maybe they’re not saying here that the world is going to end, but to declare that winter has just about reached its terminus in the northern hemisphere seems, well, ridiculous.    I can just see the new regulations that come out of the EU.    Maybe they’ll call them “the Winter Preservation Acts.”    In order to ensure snow in the elevations well into the distant future, we will all have to bicycle unless using government-sanctioned forms of public transportation.    All recreational travel will have to be curtailed, of course, to cut down on superfluous emissions.    Electricity will be strictly rationed, and each family will be allowed only .00001 kilowatt hours per day.    The government, though, because of its priority need, will be exempt from these strictures.              Oh  urlLink Ayn , can you hear us?

      Moral Hazard or Pure Genius?  urlLink You decide.   It seems New York has come up with a plan to placate a number of anti-Republican demonstrators by negotiating discounts for them at museums, stores, restaurants, and plays in the city. I doubt it will be successful in actually changing the nature of the protests. Cheap burgers and 10% off statue of liberty 1/1000th models are not likely to placate any true Bush-hater, though a trip to the museum of sex might.  Of course, I don't think the anti-Republican protests will get violent, at least not because of the protesters.

      Yesterday (or rather very early this morning) I posted a blog article describing what I call distend, discard and disintegrate—or using massive amounts of resources in order to drive their price up, providing incentives for individuals to provide alternative. Amazingly, only one post criticized the proposal. Anonymous said my plan doesn’t try to “slow the flow of waste that the production of these resources use. For most environmentalists, the point of not using gasoline is not to conserve resources, but to reduce emissions. The point of recycling aluminum is not to save aluminum from being mined, but to reduce the damage associated with mining.” That’s aboslutely true. The ultimate goal of DDD and RRR is cheap energy, organic plastics and environmental harmony at all levels. While Chris touched on this, it deserves extra exploration. Unraveling how DDD accomplishes this requires one of my favorite phrases in economics (and one that’s often ignored).  There are short term costs but long term benefits.  We see it in immigration, investment, technological advance, outsourcing, reducing government spending and some macroeconomic changes. DDD is no different. I admit the policies I proposed would create huge amounts of pollution. That’s the point (the reason why don’t like these resources and want to drive up their price is because they are environmentally harmful in some way). But once that advancement occurs, it’s there for all time. And the turnover time won’t take long. California’s energy shortage initiated sudden changes in how people were getting energy—less than a couple of years. Alumium enjoyed sharply increased in the 1960s and 1970s, during a time when steel was on the rise. Once individuals know that price increases are sustainstive, they are far more willing to invest in alternatives. Once they do that, we, our children and every generation henceforth will enjoy a cleaner environment. That’s the goal, after all.  This is why I said resource economics is counterintuitive. It doesn’t make sense that polluting the environment now will make it cleaner tomorrow. But that’s what happens. Every price stress on polluting, “undesirable” resources is another incentive to make them obsolete. There are two ways to ensure ecological harmony (EPA standards often do more harm than good, but that’s another story): create new technologies or reduce the world population. Considering the most evil men in history justified the latter, shouldn’t we do everything in our power to embrace the former?

       Here I am up at 7:30 in the morning on a perfectly good sleep-in worthy vacation day.   Why? Because my Ronnie, my son, is potty training.   So in my best 7:30 in the morning voice here I am coaxing the little devil to go pee pee in the potty.   This morning we wake up with a wet diaper so I know this will be futile, but it is necessary all the same.   And once you’re up, it’s virtually impossible to go back to bed.   Maybe I’ll get a nap later.   But this experience, while vaguely irritating to me, is essential.   It’s how he learns.   It’s how he graduates from diapers to big boy underwear.   urlLink Chris the Libertarian  yesterday made mention in one his posts about police who  urlLink tazered  a guy merely returning to his hurricane-stricken home past a government-imposed curfew.   And the article to which he refers pretty clearly sides with the cops on this one, implying that the author (and many others no doubt) thinks that this is appropriate action.   This was not a man that the cop zapped; it was an animal, a pet.   The owner says to his pet, “Pet, you may go out now.   Stop barking or I’ll put a shock collar on you.   Go to your box.”   There are way too many incidence these days of government treating its citizens like pets.   We already know they treat us like cash cows.  Folks, if you think that curfews are just fine you are mistaken.   Robert Higgs makes clear that an emergency power today is tomorrow’s policy norm.   Give ‘em an inch, and they’ll take the whole thing.   As individuals and as citizens, we have to remember that we’re potty trained.   We can go pee pee in the potty all by ourselves without government authority there to hold our hands and to tell us when we can come in and when we can go out.   We need to start acting like big boys, because allowing ourselves to be treated like children will only get us diapers.

       We’ve all heard mainstream environmentalists tell us to engage in the three R’s: reduce, reuse and recycle. We’re told that these things need to be done to save the planet. There are only so many resources and natural habitat and as the world population swells, these things will obviously become rarer and rarer. The ecological stress is too great and every environmentalist who hasn’t doomed humanity yet warns that the apocalypse is rising.  Resource economics is one of the most interesting branches of the study of choice because its proper application is usually counterintuitive. But understanding it is not that different from understanding most economics. A change in the state of the world changes prices. A change in prices changes incentives. A change of incentives changes behavior. Because of these constantly demonstrated rules, conventional environmental wisdom does more harm than good. If you really want to save the environment, even at high costs (a sacrifice many environmentalists say they are willing to take), then you should do the opposite of the typical policy.  Distending is the process of expanding capacity from an internal source. As classic mantra demands people use fewer resources, I say people should start using more. This change in behavior raises prices and creates incentives for people to find substitutes. Iron is substituted for steel, steel for aluminum and aluminum for oil-based plastics. Dupont is currently developing organic polymers.    Discarding is simply throwing things away instead of using them again. For example, avoid using both sides of paper when writing. Using more paper means corporations like the International Paper Company will have to cut down more of its privately held trees (the company owns more than a million acres for this expressed purpose; that’s about as large as Delaware). It will then grow trees to replace the ones it cut down plus grow more in anticipation of higher demand. If the price of paper rises high enough as the consumption of it increases, the company will add thousands of more acres where the trees grow peacefully for decades.  Disintegration is when an object is de-atomized, preventing anyone from recycling it. Using gasoline is an easy way to disintegrate resources. As more and more oil is used, the price increases and people start turning to renewable (and cheaper) sources. When California had an energy shortage a few years ago sales of clean energy sources skyrocketed, especially solar panels.  An effective environmental policy would be to drive your SUV to the local office supply store, buy all their paper and then throw it away along with the soda cans you quickly went through. Obviously this process is rather expensive—that’s the point. But any environmental policy (effective or not) will incur costs. I personally think those costs are too high (Office Max has a lot of paper) but considering the Sierra Club receives millions in donations every year, there are clearly some that are willing to shoulder the burden.    Skeptics of DDD might say that human society has reached the “limit” to technological progress—we can’t rely on it. How could technology possibly provide alternative for conduction or energy? To demand to know how the future will answer our questions is to insist the impossible. It’s literally asking to predict the future. We can’t imagine how the world will change no more than IBM and the Wright Brothers could imagine our world of computers and airplanes. When people use our ignorance of the future to justify environmental laws, they insult all of humanity and ignore all of modern history. The doomsayer’s predictions always depend on everything staying the same. That’s the one thing we know won’t happen.

       The Interstate Highway System is quite a remarkable thing.   Hundreds of thousands of miles of concrete and asphalt stretching out over the continent like the roots of a great oak.   On the whole, it is an extraordinary feat of mankind’s ingenuity and engineering.   But, it is also a government project.   And as a result, lurking beneath the surface are the kinds of blunders that only governments can get away with.   Which brings me to the story of the backwards bridge.  Interstate 70 runs east to west from the east coast around Philadelphia westward, and passes along its journey right through Wheeling, West Virginia.   Wheeling is a unique place situated right on the Ohio River squarely between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Columbus, Ohio.   On our drive westward along I-70, one emerges from the Wheeling Tunnel and immediately drives up onto the bridge that crosses the river.   For someone merely passing thru, all seems to be well with the world.  But upon closer inspection, one notices that the Wheeling side has two onramps, and on the other side the onramp is in a very peculiar location – it’s actually “on” the bridge itself, which is not supposed to happen for a multitude of safety reasons.   Well, what happened?   Quite simply, they put the bridge up backwards.  As you may know, bridges have long been prefabricated off-site and then merely delivered for assembly.   And Wheeling’s interstate bridge is one of these prefab deals.   But the architect misread the plans, and began putting it up backwards.   After it was all finished and someone realized that, oops it’s backwards, they hastily built that crazy ramp that terminates on the bridge itself because there was no other place to put it.   Thankfully, the bridge is structurally sound despite its rear orientation.   But it creates incredibly dangerous traffic conditions that, over the years, have resulted in way too many traffic fatalities.     Government spending rarely offers the kind of accountability and oversight that private industry provides.   Had this been a multi-million dollar private endeavor, you can be sure that the financiers would have had numerous engineers and architects all consulting together to prevent such a fiasco as this.   And had this been a private undertaking, all those individuals who have lost their lives because of faulty engineering would have had, at least posthumously, the protection of the civil courts.   But because this is a government enterprise, civil redress is exceedingly more difficult.   Which just goes to show, once again, that private enterprise is better situated to development – even of roads – than is government.   Because government, as we have seen, always seems to get it backwards.

      In a seemingly  urlLink random blog article  (about as random as my last blog entry) at Café Hayek, Dr. Don Boudreaux drew from Alfred Marshall and Adam Smith to relay the following point: wealth has causes and poverty doesn’t. Poverty, Dr. Boudreaux writes, is humanity’s default setting. If we do nothing, poverty creeps in. Poverty is easy.  I can only assume that when Dr. Boudreaux said “we,” he was referring to society in general, manifested at the state. (If he meant people as individuals, then the default setting is death which isn’t poverty at all. It’s a state of non-existence, something completely separate.) Of course, there’s a thousand things society can do to cause poverty, some of which are constantly touched on in this blog. Tariffs, subsidies, industry regulations, immigration laws and progressive taxes all push society down toward the poverty end of the spectrum. Spontaneous order, free markets and decentralization are the wealth creating vehicles and these are institutions that are really easy to make.  Dr. Boudreaux points out that some wealth-creating institutions—property rights, money, language and double-entry book keeping—all had to be actively made by someone. Some of these institutions also have to be backed by the state. That’s very true. The state has the power to reinforce wealth creation and to make laws that generate poverty. Each one requires work and neither status is “default” in any way. Even in the darkest, most oppressive hours in human history, people were able to create wealth (though every slowly). It’s not that poverty is easy. People just make it easy because they so deeply believe in the economic barriers that create poverty.

      This is a fun concept that really pisses off government idealists: a free market economy is more democratic than any political system. Just watch Adult Swim—shows on Cartoon Network aimed a mature audience. They occasionally show their ratings. They’re also lucky if a half a million people (a whopping 0.17% of the entire country's population) watch their top show. When less than 1% of the nation wants a product, they get it. When 49% of the voters want a candidate, they get ignored.  Who says corporations don’t care about the people?

      Eric Helland, who is now writing for the Marginal Revolution,  urlLink wrote a post  that cites an article by Jonathan Rauch, claiming Hayek would have been against legalizing gay marriages. The essence of the argument is a quote from Hayek in which he compares customs to prices. If prices have bunches of tacit knowledge stored in them, it makes sense that customs do too; they are both the result of spontaneous order. If we try to change them, then who knows what will happen?  Like me, Helland disagrees with this conclusion, saying “Hayek is making a case for gradual institutional change.” In order words, Helland believes that the decision should be up to the states. Nothing like a wide sweeping ban or legalization should be enacted.  But if we really do care about spontaneous order, then we can only conclude that’s not the answer, either. Saying the government should move slowly in legalizing gay marriage is like saying farm subsidies should be weaned away. Like a tariff artificially adjusting the price of a good, a law against marriage—federal or otherwise—artificially adjusts the cultural landscape. Cultural practices, like prices, are evolving things and they have to change with the world around them. While gay marriages really might have been fundamentally disrupting fifty or a hundred years ago, we don’t know if that’s the case now. “Institutional gradualism,” as Helland puts it, wouldn’t be Hayek’s preferred vehicle for change because it legitimizes laws that really do fall to the fatal conceit: social behavior between individuals should be applied to everyone in a community whether they want it or not.  Laws against gay marriages, like almost any laws, are made at the whim of political interests. Sometimes they are perfectly appropriate but usually they’re not. In either case, they become archaic as the world changes. The vast majority of laws aren’t perfect reflections of the cultural conditions and will ultimately become barriers in a society valuing spontaneous order.

      Roderick T. Long posted  urlLink this article  at Liberty and Power, where he tries desperately to re-educate politicians the virtues of economic behavior (I say desperately because I doubt any politicians are reading libertarian blogs, though they certainly should). As Long explains why politicians shouldn’t attack “price gougers” in the wake of Hurricane Charley, I realized I have no idea what a “gouger” is.  In everyday conversation, a “gouger” is someone who charges “too much” for a good, "taking advantage" of the market. In the comments section, Mark Fulwiler suggests a “gouger” is someone who charges more than the competition or the government says is “fair.” Obviously, people who charge more than their competitors have some kind of product differentiation going on or will be put out of business. Government judgment is the more interesting case especially since it’s usually the government that declares price gouging (because the other one is self correcting).  How does the government decide if something is “too much?” Well, it’s ultimately a congressional consensus and/or a presidential conclusion based on limited understanding of time and place, appeal to emotion, organizations with big voting blocks and the political landscape.  This is excellent because now I can confirm I’m a victim. My car is on the verge of dying—I’ll be needed a new one in probably less than two years. I’m a student and can barely afford to buy a new one but I’ll need one some time in the future to continue my graduate studies (cry for me). Luxury car companies make a great deal of money selling their products while it is becoming more and more necessary to own a quality car in this country to live a life (get angry). In fact, if I could afford a new car, especially a premium one that will last a long time and keep me comfortable while I drive, I’ll be able to go long distances to find the best position for me, which would help the economy and your kids because I want to teach; I might even start participating in meals on wheels or helping senior citizens in some other way (mobilize your forces). And with an election coming up, I’m sure there’s lots of people that would agree with me (attack!).  Obviously, the people who make high-quality cars are price gouging. Someone owes me a Lexus.

      If politicians weren’t spending the public’s money when they tried to plan for uncertain events, it would just be really funny when they try. Unfortunately, it’s a bit too real. The Des Moines Register  urlLink reported today  that a new state-run morgue will not be getting their business from Polk County (where Des Moines is centered).  A tight budget and poor planning is mostly responsible for the $9 million mistake. The original plan was to streamline and centralize the state’s autopsies by making one facility the government could run. The new building was designed to employ thirty-four employees. Now, thanks to budget cuts, there are only eight so it can only handle a fraction of what it was designed for.  But the budget cut, which are an unavoidable result when the government does thousands of things and sudden administration and economic changes force constant reallocation, isn’t the sole source of the problem. Far from it. Like all big government projects, this one was subject to politics and/or gross incompetence (something all Iowans have to pay for). Dr. Julia Goodin, the head state medical examiner, was the main force behind the project but failed to make enough noise at state legislators. “With all the requests that we get, if they're not going out and asking, they're certainly not going to get it,” said House Majority Leader Chuck Gipp, R-Decorah.  It gets better. To help raise the $4.7 million the examiner’s office needs to centralize the facilities, the state is increasing the price for birth and death certificates but they are refusing private autopsies. The bump in the price of certificates would only raise $400,000 a year at most.  Let’s review, shall we? Because the government does so many things (the vast majority is counterproductive and economically unwise) funding for something the government actually needs to do (for the purposes solving murders) weakened. Moreover, the state’s emphasis on long term planning using a fluctuating budget makes the project incredibly subject to waste: the facility is now too large considering the number of people that work there. Instead of relying on privatized autopsies, which would most likely be of better quality and cheaper of the government, the Iowa legislature relies on a new tax, one that is ultimately not nearly enough to pick up the slack.  Scarier still, if—say—the birth certificates get too expensive, new parents might have to strain their budget in other areas and deny their kid quality diapers, nutritious food, toys or other amenities. Later, that just might explode into a new policy action which would provide those parents with those things using taxpayer money, stretching the budget even more and deny the morgue from maintaining a budget that’s still probably too small.  Okay, so it’s a little funny.

       Why do Democrats (and Republicans, too) think the economy is magical? As my last school semester threatens to start up again, I’ve been spending the past week or so watching reruns of The West Wing, a show about the administration of a Democratic president. So naturally, there are a lot of Democratic-style proposals set forth, not the least of which concerns the virtues of progressive taxes.  The argument goes something like this: rich people use their extra money to buy yachts and middle class people use their extra money to buy college tuition. Since “society” values tuition over yachts, we should tax rich people more and give that money to everyone else. Ultimately, the argument is that this is better for the economy, and by extension, humanity in general.  Here’s the magic. Pervicacious Democrats think yachts come from a genie or some other sort of fairy tale apparatus. When rich people buy yachts (or when anyone buys anything), people have to supply and maintain it; they don’t come from no where. An increase of yacht sales employs people who make them, sell them, keep marinas, repairs boats, staffs boats and manufactures equipment that’s used in boats. These people, in turn, buy resources from those that allow them to do their job: lumberjacks, miners, steel formers, Alcoa employees, computer programmers, the people who make the machines that make the electronics and on and on and on.  Now you could say that college tuitions help people too: professors, writers, maintenance workers, publishers, security guards, construction workers and on and on and on. We could spend weeks trying to track all the people that are helped by one kind or spending versus another and we will never be able to enumerate them all; it’s just too complicated.   The point is saying that either good is a vacuum, having no additional benefits to the average person is a lie. It’s that kind of twisted logic that makes people think banks burn the money corporations put in their coffers instead of what they actually do: lend it out to people for houses, cars, small businesses and yes, even tuition. The ultimate value of a good is what the market demands, not how the average person views it, and considering it’s harder and harder to get a job with just a bachelor’s degree, maybe that’s a signal that we need more yacht buyers.

      In the wake of Hurricane Charley President Bush is visiting the devastation, lending support to the victims of the disaster.  And promising them our money.  CNN  urlLink published a report  citing the commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Guy Tunnel (whose name I wanted to mention mostly so I can point out that it sounds like a gay bar). Tunnel recalled the devastation, the lives lost from the hurricane, the massive undertaking that’s required to survey the damage. So it’s no wonder that President Bush stated the federal government is on its way to help pick up the tab estimated to be as much as  urlLink $11 billion .  Correct me if I’m wrong but Florida isn’t known for its hurricanes? In fact, didn’t a little thing called Hurricane Andrew come through twelve years ago? In fact, don’t hurricanes occur in that area every year at around the same time? I believe there’s a whole season named after them. It’s called hurricane season.  The point is the victims of the tragedy shouldn’t make everyone else in the country pay for the flaws of their real estate. Hurricanes are a real, proven threat to the area; inhabitants should just buy insurance. If they can’t afford it, they should move. Everyone can’t live any where.

      A number of my friends have come out in favor of tort reform, for selfish, though quite understandable reasons: it means their medical bills drop in price.  But whenever government action reduces the price, someone is paying. Most likely, it's the people whose bills drop. Assume for a moment that the Bushies succeed in limiting the damages that can be paid in a tort. The argument goes as follows: a reduced payout from a lost suit means a smaller malpractice insurance premium. Such a reduction in the premium would imply the price of medical care would drop equivalently [this assumes  exceptionally  high price elasticity; I would be willing to bet that a very, very small portion of the savings actually get passed on to consumers, as the market is rather inelastic].  But what of the consequences of reduced premiums? Changing the cost of malpractice should ultimately change the very incentive structure for doctors. As the cost of malpractice drops for doctors, so should the incidence of it rise. So yes, your visits to the doctor will be cheaper, but also riskier.

      Fuzzy Math, at least in the 2000 election, was not numbers that did not exist, but numbers that were arbitrary or arrived at by approximation, etc.  I would call his budget plan sketchy (as in, a rough draft, rather than dangerous or shady). David's account of it, and the article's admission that the numbers were arrived at not from Kerry himself but from a "third party" (aka AEI) suggests that David is dishonest to accuse Kerry of poor math. More appropriate would be to accuse him of being vague.  David should also be aware that the president does not make the budget. While he has the power to propose budgets and plans to Congress, it is ultimately the legislative that makes the real decisions in the details of the budget. Let's not forget, of course, that George Bush is equally guilty of expanding government spending. Quoth Dick Cheney: "Reagan proved that deficits don't matter."

      Remember back in 2000 when George W. Bush kept accusing Gore of using “fuzzy math” and everyone that didn’t want to vote for the Governor thought that was uproarious? Fuzzy math—what on earth is fuzzy math? No one really knew except we knew it was supposed to be bad. Great stuff. But for all the hard-line democrats reading this post (if there are any): stop laughing because John Kerry recently showed us what fuzzy math is all about.  Well, technically it was Kevin Hassett who posted  urlLink this article  at Tech Central Station outlining the Kerry budget. Kevin and his team combed though the nominee’s speeches, web site and other sources for budget promises to try to construct a master plan that the campaign refuses to create. While the Senator claims he’ll balance the budget, the reality is his proposals will sink the deficit another $2.2 trillion over the next ten years. As of the writing of this post, the  urlLink US National Debt Clock  estimates the debt at about $7.3 trillion.  Absolutely hilarious.
