      I’m so excited! Yesterday I rode a horse! Yes, me of little faith in big animals actually got onto and STEERED a huge horse! It all happened because Daniel has made a friend at work, Jarod. Jarod used to be a professional jockey and together with his girlfriend own a huge (and I mean HUGE) horse named Bobby. When Daniel came home yesterday he asked me if Lachlan and myself would like to go and see the horse, perhaps even get Lachlan to have a ride. I was surprised at how big horses actually are. Bobby is taller than I am and his eyes are like big saucers either side of his head. I patted him cautiously but each time Bobby moved, I moved – about a foot backwards. Lachlan went for a few laps with Daniel holding onto him and Jarod steering Bobby from the front. It took only a few seconds before Lachlan felt right at home on top of the beast and decided he wanted to go for 5 trots around the ring. After Lachlan finished, Jarod asked me if I would like to have a go. I said yes before my brain had a chance to remind me that heights are not a strong point of mine. Daniel helped me onto Bobby and as I held on for dear life, Jarod led the horse slowly around the area. There was another rider in the exercise area with us, and she rode next to me. I think it was her that suggested I try steering Bobby. I SHAT my pants!!!! "You want me to steer the horse?" I said, all shocked and awed. "Yeah, its easy, just pretend like it’s a go cart and pull slightly on the side in the direction you want him to go" said Jarod and Miss calmly rides a horse. "Um, ok" I said, real convincingly. So off I went, almost steering Bobby into the other girl’s horse a few times, but other than that I did pretty well. " Hey Dan, what do you think? Pretty good for her first time on a horse!" said Jarod. I rode around once steering Bobby all on my own until he decided that he wanted to be in front of the other horse and started to speed up. "Um is the horse going FASTER??" I said, trying hard not to squeal but failing dismally. So that ended my ride of Bobby the horse. Daniel also had a turn, but almost steered poor Bobby into a fence so he lasted a big 20 seconds before asking to get off – right. Now. We watched Jarod take him for a gallop around the paddock and of course, he made it look so easy. His dog ran along behind him excitedly and as Daniel said, it was a real ‘Aussie’ sight. So now I’m thinking that I would like to learn how to ride a horse and one-day own one. Daniel new that was going to happen so he asked Jarod earlier in the day how much it cost’s to keep a horse so that he could tell me there was no way I can get one. Oh well, I will always have Bobby.

      Lachlan asked me this morning why it is that he is not allowed to play with guns. I said simply, "Guns are not toys, they kill people" Then I had a think about it. I hadn’t realised that I was like that. It had just happened over the years that I never brought my son a plastic water gun or light up battery operated machine gun. I feel really good. My son has now gone to Pre School and passed on this bit of little mummy wisdom to his friends. " I’m not allowed to play with guns, because they kill people and it’s not fun to pretend to kill people, my Mum said so" Wow. I’m so FREAKING chuffed. It really has made me wonder at the power us parents have to mould our children into the people we want them to be. I want my son to value the earth, understand his and others rights, be tolerant of differences and above all, respect all human life. And today my little guy has learnt that not even pretending to kill is acceptable in our home. Guns in reality are awful things designed to end life and maim. There was no other purpose for the invention of guns and there is no other reason why they are still manufactured and sold around the world. They are made to murder. Just ask my 4-year-old.

      Hi! well after many months of debating the worthiness of having my own little piece of web to call my own, ive finally taken the plunge and created a blog! YAY FOR ME! So who am I? Where did I come from? Why do I rant? Why do I rave? All will be revealed over time in this little spot of mine.  Today my son Lachlan is at pre school having his first ever school pictures taken. He has a new haircut and spiffy little outfit on and as he informed me this morning, he actually looks like Spiderman. I was under the impression that Spiderman wore a red and black body suit but, heh, what do I know! Apparently Lachlan has been watching the  other  version of the movie where Toby Mcquire decides that he looks a little gay in his hero outfit and chooses to instead go to the little fella's section in Kmart and buy a check shirt and jeans. Or maybe, this is what Spiderman wears to school photo day! Lachlan, my little hero.  Speaking of men in tights, My brother in law has become a festering, jelly like, lump on my couch. He came over for a visit about 2000 years ago and just hasnt left. He sits and sits and SITS - occasionally moving to pee or eat. I am starting to fear coming home from work and finding him fossilised, like petrified wood, in an eternal position of unemployed slackness on our couch.  Wayne, please leave.
