      My darling boyfriend had better be asleep at this very moment. Guess what the sleepyhead did? Happily threw his wallet next to the rubbish chute and didnt even realize it. Got us both whipped into a panic cos he reckoned he had thrown it INTO the chute. Thank goodness two Samaritans picked it up and returned it. Blessings on their kind heads. I was especially upset cos not only were his money and IC inside, but also because the wallet was a present from me and it also held neoprints of fond memories. I had half a mind to let fly but he was so upset and tired I just couldnt bear to. Was actually contemplating taking the train back to his place and wait the night out to catch the cleaners who come by in the early morning. Thank goodness for the two angels.   So much for that fiasco. Anyway there is this really funny scenario at my workplace. Apparently there is an exodus taking place. Our staff are one by one popping over to the neighboring office, an employment agency, to beg for jobs. Everyone wants to leave! The Ops Manager has put out positions on job websites and the job descriptions match two of the guys' exactly. They were pretty upset, especially since one of them is trying to plan his wedding and putting down payments for his new flat. Poor chap. Not a drop of pity for the fat pervert though. When he gets dropped like a hot potato, I'll laugh long and hard. Bwahahaha.... But first, I gotta get me outta there!  Today is the last day I accompany the flock of trainees (Baaa!) to Jurong Island. Now that their passes are settled, my manager and I can rest easy. Oh yeah, I got full marks for my OPSOC (Oil & Petrochemical Safety Orientation Course) test! I get a certification which allows me entry into any process plant for the next 3 years. Remote possibility of that happening but it is rather grand to hold one all the same :). Next thing is I have a chance to write a full length article for the Southwest CDC monthly newsletter on our Place and Train program. That would really be a feather in my cap, and hopefully position myself a bit closer to fulfilling my dreams of becoming a writer.  One minor irritation: next Monday I might have to set foot on the stinky island if Mr S.L. is nosy enough to request a visit to CPTC. FYI, S.L. is the manager of a member company of ours. He is an arrogant ass through and through. He picks on everything I do, scolds me when I am simply following instructions from my manager, and yells when he is disturbed at lunch. Look, Mr Diva. Just because you are at managerial level doesn't change the fact that you are loud-mouthed, nasty and downright rude. Where are your manners? Your mother didn't teach you? I'm not a bit scared of your loud voice since you are so short, I can barely hear you anyway. You are just a low level manager, and frankly, I've met people who are at junior or even craftsman level, who exhibit more princely manners that you can ever muster. Shame on you!   Would like to pitch all sycophantic snobs into the bonfires of hell. Burn baby burn....

      Sent out a measly number of resumes. Gonna hit the sack soon. Tired out. Tomorrow is gonna be a looooong day. Gotta reach Jurong East MRT by 8am. Madness! Then take the hired bus to Jurong Island with Boss and a bunch of trainees. Good thing is I won't need to be in the stuffy office tomorrow. Bad thing? I get to inhale weird smelling air and endure dust blowing in my face in that god-forsaken place. Only thing I look forward to everyday is being in my darling's arms and feeling that everything is alright again. I know people are always saying even the attached need some space of their own and that spending too much time with one's partner is unhealthy. I beg to differ. Each of us have our own levels of tolerances and different types of needs. I happen to have everything I need in my dear. He's my best friend, confidante, guru, lover and soulmate all combined in one heck of a guy. He would be surprised to see me writing stuff like this since he is the more expressive of us both when it comes to matters of the heart. I, on the other hand, feel somewhat uncomfortable and vulnerable vocalising my feelings. Guess that's a good thing. Otherwise we would make a regular pair of love-declaring Romeo and Juliet, balcony not withstanding. Feel kinda woozy right now, so off I go. Goodnight y'all.

      Good Morning to Me! Suppose to be sending out resumes but decided to drop by here a bit. Am trying to figure out the technicalities of changing my fonts, colors and template with little luck and much disaster so far. Well I did mention I'm a bit of a tech idiot. I wanna be one of those gadget whizzes who own digi-cameras and snazzy PDAs, create webpages at the drop of a hat, wax lyrical about the latest ooh-I-gotta-have-it phone models and conduct languid discourses on software as easily as commenting on the weather. Well, in time... in due time....  Had a good badminton session with Boyfriend yesterday. Played a whole 1 hour 45 minutes instead of the allocated 1 hour. We got there earlier and found the courts empty. In the words of my dear... ' mai tu liao!'. Had an excruciatingly painful start cos my bones were still creaky and muscles sore. But I warmed up after half an hour, and managed to put up a passable performance.Pretty good workout. Was sweating buckets and puffing like a grampus. Though that could have been the bad ventilation.... Think I was giving Boyfriend a hard time.  I kept insisting that he play fair and not go easy on me just because I was stiff and had a blistered hand. But when he started to make me run around the court (Excuse me? Sore!!), my face turned black. Must admit that he is pretty quick for a hefty guy. Quite skillful. Of course, I should know...  Sigh, really need to get a new job. The current workplace (which I will not mention lest heads roll) is a real barnyard with rats, pigs and snakes abound. I mean, can we please put aside our personal likes and dislikes and carry out our duties like normal adults? Apparently not. Anyway, the jerk (we shall call him Mr J) didn't turn up on Friday. Was told he took leave to nurse his broken heart. Was dumped by his China girlfriend so it seems. Well, let me just say that I don't believe he even has a girlfriend. This is a guy who shows me pics of this girl downloaded from the computer onto A4 paper and claimed she was his girlfriend. Another day, he brought a photograph showing a guy and a girl on either side of him, and claimed the girl was his ex-girlfriend (they were sitting like a mile apart!). All this while, he regales the office with tales of his 1000 and 1 exes, but never a word of his current 'girlfriend' until I mentioned it aloud in front of everyone. When he harassed me by smsing me he loved me and calling me late at night to chat, and when I confided in my boss for advice, he turned the story around and told everyone that I had the mistaken impression that he liked me.   What I can say, Mr J, is this. A fat, stinky, egoistic, ass-ugly pervert like you will never get a sane female to come within two metres of you unless she were (a) paid a million bucks, (b) a prostitute, or (c) your mother. That so-called downloaded pic of a girlfriend (fucking ugly!) who dumped you must have been some penpal who eventually saw your photo on the web and ran for her life. That girl beside you in the photo (fucking ugly!!) was unfortunate and stupid enough to sit beside you and was punished by being unsuspectingly slapped with the label of being your girlfriend. Those 1001 and 1 exes exist only in that sorry, pathetic, attention-starved peabrain of yours. So QUIT staring at my boobs, QUIT calling me on my phone, QUIT whining about your non-existant girlfriends and QUIT telling me sob stories about your life before I suckerpunch you in the groin. You make me cringe, you make me nauseous, you make me feel dirty by association. And next time, should I feel the need, I will just download and print out pics of the pope and proclaim him my lover. YOU BIG LOSER.  Man. That was carthartic. Ahhhhh.......

      Bad time to start a blog. Im a lousy tech person in the ordinary way but on a morning like this, after just four hours of sleep, the pc screen looks somewhat alien to me. I dun know who or what will ever read my rantings, but hey, I'm doing this for myself. I figured, this is a great way to test the genuity of my aspirations of becoming a hot shot editor/novelist/journalist (watch out Anna Wintour!). If I cant even stand writing in this space after just 3 days, I'll know what to strike off on my list of career options.   Going for badminton later with my dear. He will kill me if I let on, but I beat him 2-1 last week. What tickles me so is that it must have been ten years since I last picked up a racquet. And Boyfriend was the Vice Captain of the badminton team just one year back *guffaw*. But I suffered painfully for it. Have this terrible soreness in muscles I never knew even existed. At least those on-court physics-defying contortions paid off. Give it up for the girrrrls!!! Thats it for now. Brain shutting.....down. Must....slee...eep....

      Saw my arms in the sunlight today. Before I go further, let me establish that I am absolutely terrified of the sun. Freaking scared. I slink among shadows. I live my life under umbrellas. I delight in the darkest corners of the bus or MRT train. While people take to the beach in their skimpiest of bikinis or lift their faces up to the warm sun rays, I am usually bundled up to my neck and wrists if (by some freak accident) I happen to be outdoors that day. I don't remember when this neurotism started.  Back to my arms. They looked deathly pale today. White. I could practically see my veins, green and pulsing, snaking up my arms. It gave me such a thrill. Damn sick in the brain right? Went home and saw the same thing on my chest. A web of veins extending from my rib area up to my shoulders. OOOH. Guess the doctor will have no problem locating veins on  this  patient....  I wish I had skin like Liv Tyler. White and translucent. Little wonder that I had a collage of her pics on my computer screen not too long ago. My boyfriend has held up reasonably well, for all the times I've insisted on carrying an umbrella on cloudy days (clouds do not block out UV rays!) and worn the thickest and most shapeless of sweaters to shield every inch of my skin from the death rays. Can't imagine what other guys would do if their girlfriends always appeared like this in public. Well, at least I don't flash my boobs in low cut tops anymore. At least not until I'm safe in the shade. FYI, 90% of sun damage occur indirectly on the skin *horrors*. So if you spot anyone dashing past windows or trying to fit behind conveniently placed pillars, you know who you're looking at.

      Just thought I'd swing by a second to pen down some of today's happenings. First and foremost, I'm struggling to string together coherent sentences in my present exhausted condition. Visited my alma mater. Not many fond memories there so that's that. Been all over Clementi and it's such humid weather too. Apparently someone DEAR to my heart was greatly lacking in his topographic skills today, and we wound out lost and fumbling in the dark. It's been a tiring day at work and what gets my goat is my manager spent just three and a half hours in the office. Rest of the time, she conveniently had meetings or simply took a long leisurely lunch. Ahh the perks of being Boss. Tomorrow is Friday and I'm so looking forward to a good rest this weekend. After a badminton session on Saturday, that is. Can't tahan anymore my brain is screaming for some shuteye. Goodnight world.
