      A few weeks ago, I spent time in the North Cascades (Washington State) on an Outward Bound canoeing/backpacking trip. Wow! It was amazing to see how eight teachers could come together in such a short amount of time. Normally on longer Outward Bound trips, participants spend several days on a solo expedition. The solo is not about survival, it's about reflection. We had an opportunity to complete a four-hour solo. Here are some things I wrote during that time...  June 24, 2004 I am happy here and now All alone, among the creaking trees The constant wind in my ears The lake sparkles below me Reminding me of distances paddled, strokes learned, steering perfected, Devil's Creek gorge explored White water rocks the boat, prevents steady paddling  Aspen leaves stick to green leaves on the forest floor, like cobwebs of the past Skeletons of yesterday I compulsively want to pick them off-- like dead skin but I refrain The skin of the forest  I'm shedding my outer shell of emotional wall The trees above sway dangerously back and forth, left and right but I am safe, not afraid  A chipmunk scurries to and fro and sounds like a giant on crushed leaves I am in control but the weather washes over me The mountains rise above me to tell me there is always something for which to strive  Though I will never climb Mt. Everest I will admire the view from Desolation Peak and feel like I'm on top of the world- my reward for struggling not the weakest link an equal contributing member of the expedition team singing, flowering, throwing snowballs, smiling, thinkng  Moss is soft and comfortable Maybe my favorite plant  What would make this time better Is someone to share it with Someone to kiss and hug and cuddle  From here I see no one, hear no one, talk with no one, my company is Mother Earth and me I am at Peace.  ~~~~~~~~~ Two songs were running through my head as I sat among the leaves and trees:  Peace, I ask of thee o River Peace, peace, peace When I learn to live serenely Cares will cease From the hills I gather courage Visions of the day to be Strength to lead and faith to follow All are given unto me Peace I ask of the o River Peace, peace, peace ~~~~~  You must give yourself to love If love is what you're after Open up your heart to The tears and laughter and Give yourself to love  I've walked these mountains in the rain I've learned to love the wind I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin I always knew I'd find you, though I never did know how Like sunshine on a cloudy day You stand before me now

      A fun evening tonight; a bunch of Ellen's friends and I started off by playing some Frisbee at the Stanford Oval. Then we headed over to the Dish and hiked around the loop by sunset-- we stopped and found a geocache along the way. (#97!) We followed our strenuous (ok, not so much, but we did burn some calories!) hike with a scrumptious dinner at Darbar. (Third spicy meal in a row, following a Mexican lunch today (during which, for the third time, I didn't have lunch money when Victoria and I went out!) and Thai dinner last night!)  When I first met up with Ellen at the Oval, she gave me a big hug, but I gave her a small one. We didn't hike next to each other, and we sat at opposite ends of the table from each other at dinner. I felt her quiet presence, and I didn't feel the need to be any closer than that. When she brought us all back to the Oval, I could tell she wanted more, but I headed back almost right away. (Oddly enough, finding a loaf of bread on the roof of my car! What is it with food and my car-- first Jello on the back, then white bread on the roof?!?!? Crazy Palo Altoans!)  I've made excuses not to see her this week because I had a weird feeling about the intense relationship that was developing. Tonight, however, I enjoyed very much since I felt the pressure was off. We enjoyed each others' presence. I think I like her much better as a friend. If something more develops from it, then that's fine-- I think we just need time to get to know each other.  I don't really understand how dating works; it seems like it's a process of getting to know each other. But there seems to be a great deal of pressure attributed to it. But then again, maybe it's just Ellen?  Her friends were cool, though, and I look forward to hanging out with them again!

      So what's the difference, you might ask? Etymologically, the two words are quite similar. I was quite confused for the first several weeks of working at NASA, since the building I work in houses the Astrobiology Institute. It turns out, however, that the Astrobiology Institute is on the first floor, and my office is on the second floor, in the life sciences division. I work for the Bioastronautics group which is located at Johnson Space Center, in Houston.     Astrobiology: the search for life elsewhere in the universe.   Bioastronautics: seeking to understand the effects of microgravity on astronauts' bodies.     Aha!

      Tonight's iced chai from the Red Rock Cafe in Mountain View was not nearly as good as the iced chai I made when I was in the North Cascades.   When we were canoeing, we had to purify the lakewater with iodine. Since it didn't taste wonderful, we often added some lemonade powder to it. One morning, I poured powdered milk into my water by accident (thinking it was lemonade!). Yuck! So to make the best of the situation, I decided to make some chai. I added a chai tea bag, placed my red Nalgene in the sun, and let the sun do its work. By late afternoon, I had warm, steeped, tasty chai! When we canoed into Devil's Creek gorge, the water temperature dropped by tens of degrees, so I tied my Nalgene onto the stern of the boat and dropped it in the water to chill. Yum, iced chai!   Tonight's chai wasn't nearly as good.

      And this is H2. I feel better now that I've realized this.   Catch the Wind, by Donovan (performed by Joan Baez)   In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty  I'll want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind  To feel you all around me and to take my hand along the sand  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind   When sundown pales the sky I want to hide awhile, behind your smile  And everywhere I look your eyes I'd find  For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing, would make me sing  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind   When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears  To help me to leave all my blues behind  For standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

      What a weekend!     Friday evening was disappointing since we didn't make it to see the 1950s version of "Cheaper by the Dozen" at the Stanford Theater. We ended up walking around downtown Palo Alto instead and talked before parting ways. The conversation clarified a lot, though I didn't feel that way at the time.     It made it easier for me to enjoy Saturday as much as I did, though! First we met at the oval at Stanford and she showed me the echo spot, a cement circle by the chapel. If you stand in the middle of it, and read the inscription around it, you can hear your voice echoing! Very neat.     Then we proceeded to the Stanford dish, a very nice place for hiking. Lots of hawks circling around, and we solved the mystery of the blue tarps. There are giant tarps over large portions of the hillside. Apparently, researchers in the conservation biology department at Stanford are trying to eliminate invasive species, and they have found that by covering the invasive species with tarps, the plants germinate in a warm, dark, inviting environment, but they don't receive any sunlight. Then, the invasive plants die out, and the native species can live there instead. Pretty cool!     Following our hike, we proceeded to Stacks' in Menlo Park, a great place for brunch! We split banana wheat germ pancakes and a garden crepe: yum!     From there we headed to the city to see a photography exhibit (Photo San Francisco). There were some absolutely stunning photos; the one we liked best was of autumn leaves. The colors were outstanding, including reds, yellows, and purples. Sometimes I miss fall.     Then we made it back to Palo Alto for the Tea Dance, at which I was the youngest by far! (Well, except for E, but she's still older!) We danced, we chatted with lesbians, very cool!     Then we were hungry, so we made it to Pluto's for salad and grilled eggplant/red pepper sandwich (again, splitting everything; it's great that we have the same taste and she's a quasi-vegetarian). It was fun to try to explain who all the people were on the wall (from Mork and Judy Jetson to Sally Ride and John Glenn!).     Back to her place for some cuddling and  Tipping the Velvet . We only made it through two of the three episodes since we were both exhausted from our adventurous day!     This morning I got up and went for a bikecaching trip; biked 16 miles around the baylands, found the Stevens Creek Trail, found NASA, found 2 caches. I'm up to 91. :-) I've got to make it to 100!     Biking was great since the birds were out and it was a fantastic way to clear my mind. I'm happy!

      I'm feeling quite like this at the moment. It's sometime in July, and I forgot that she was leaving. I fell gently, but she caught me before I reached the ground.     By Dar Williams    The summer ends and we wonder where we are    And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car    And you both look so young    And last night was hard, you said    You packed up every room    And then you cried and went to bed    But today you closed the door and said    "We have to get a move on.    It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead,    We push ourselves ahead."      And it was cloudy in the morning    And it rained as you drove away    And the same things looked different    It's the end of the summer    It's the end of the summer,    When you move to another place      And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same    She walked alone all spring,    She had a boyfriend when the summer came    And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm    They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn    And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving    So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves    She held on to his sleeves      And she doesn't want to let go    'Cause she won't know what she's up against    The classrooms and the smart girls    It's the end of the summer    It's the end of the summer    When you hang your flowers up to dry

      The miniature rosebush on my desk is dying. At first I consciously checked its water level every day, maybe several times a day.I made sure it was happy, in the sun, and it bloomed.     It has weathered a lot in the past 7 months-- I thought it had died for good when I was in Japan in February since no one took care of it. When I came back and gave it some attention, it revived and even rebloomed. Since then, it's been sitting in the sun, receiving occasional water.     During the past few weeks, though, it's been suffering from inattention. Now half of the leaves are brown; stalks are drying out. I could pluck the dead leaves, but they serve as a reminder of its former glory. The dead leaves fall and litter my cluttered desk. No matter how many I clean up, more still seem to fall.     I don't need this rosebush. There are roses blooming on the giant rosebushes outside, and I can smell their sweet fragrance drifting in through the window.     Maybe I should put the little one outside to learn from the big ones, then bring it back inside in a few weeks? Maybe then I will learn how to be less dependent on it.    I probably don't want to abandon it forever, though.

      Tonight's my first big presentation for my new job with NASA. I get to talk to teachers about all the cool research that scientists are doing on the ground and on the International Space Station (ISS). I'm a bit nervous about it, partly because it's my first presentation as part of a new job, partly because I'm worried I don't know enough about the content. But I only have to speak for 15 minutes (with a PowerPoint), then the teachers will get to do hands-on activities after that.     Today I get to work from home, something I couldn't do as a teacher!! Yay!     Ok, so I guess that means I should actually get some work done. Since I don't have sick days accrued yet, I've got to work a long day to make up for hours missed yesterday and Monday.

      So I was supposed to be in a wedding last weekend, but it had to be postponed since the groom was in the hospital with intestine problems. It turns out that he had to be in the hospital for an extra week while he regained strength and ability to eat solid food. Then he went home for two days, then started bleeding internally and passed out. So his fiancee called 911 and they rushed him to the hospital, where he had to undergo another emergency surgery to stop the internal bleeding. That happened this past Thursday, and he's still unconscious (deliberately) while the doctors figure out what's going on.     I feel bad for M! She must be so stressed. At least his father flew in to help take care of the situation. While I spent time with her in the waiting room (playing the card game of Settlers of Catan), two doctors came to talk to her about the situation. It was very confusing, and each doctor seemed to be convinced that they were correct in their diagnosis and recommended treatments. I'm not sure how I would handle the situation if my partner were in the hospital with a life-threatening or otherwise serious condition. I would definitely want someone else there to figure out what was reasonable. I can't imagine how BB did it last year. It just seems like you really need to do as much research as possible.     M beat me twice at the card game. :-) That makes three defeats for me in the past week! Hmmm. I wonder how much of it is strategy and how much is luck!

      Her wisdom goes beyond 20 years.   I don't want her to bear the burden of my happiness or my healing.   "The trick is to be happy when you're alone."      "Oh, I'm already good at that!"  "And to know that people out there love you; you might just have to rebuild some connections."       "It's also wonderful to know that I don't have to be alone."   I had a terrific evening tonight which perfectly matched my mood. After last night's mess with TJ, it felt great to be with H2. A relaxed dinner, watching "Cheaper by the Dozen" (ok, who wouldn't want to have twelve kids after that movie?!?), music and cuddles and profoundness in the dark. I felt completely comfortable.   I think now I understand a bit of the nervousness she was feeling earlier. As I feel myself growing attached, I dread the end of the summer and getting too close. As I seem to want to follow my heart, I will probably just let myself go.   One time, at a rest stop in New Jersey, I saw the following written in black Sharpie on a yellow wet floor sign: "It's better to fall in love than to fall on the floor."   Dar Williams:  "It is better to fall in love than to never have fallen at all."  Why does falling feel like soaring?

      So there's an upside to the Circle Game, too.  Last week I was a little disappointed that I didn't hear from H2. She kept saying she would call but something always seemed to come up. I thought it was because she had a rotten time on the camping trip and didn't want to see me again.  Finally we saw each other briefly on Saturday and for a nice long Giants game on Sunday. We also had a terrific, profound conversation on Sunday, during which we both realized that we have many of the same thoughts and thought processes. Also during which I realized that she really does care about what I'm thinking (evidence: she finally asked and listened while I responded and didn't let me stop talking)! She also was extremely appreciative of the fact that I had given her so much space last week and was giving her so much time surrounding us sleeping together.  We also talked about emotional intimacy, and how we hadn't achieved it yet but were working toward it. I still wonder how emotional intimacy happens.

      In guitar class today we finally played a song that I really like: Joni Mitchell's "Circle Game." Yay! Now I feel more motivation to practice the darn C and F chords!  In more ways than one, I feel like my life is a circle game. OR at least a lesbian game.  So I told TJ that I was upset that she and CC had gone rockclimbing with a bunch of our friends on Friday night. Mostly because I felt excluded (partly for reasonable reasons and partly for unreasonable reasons). Then on Saturday it was a bit difficult to see TJ and CC cuddling at the movie (as mentioned below). I did come to the conclusion that I was going through the difficult mourning stage and had a conversation with TJ to that effect. But TJ had shared my emotions with CC, and so I got a phone call from CC this morning at work. A little bit of a shock. She wanted to confront me about what I was feeling. Yes, I had been a little ticked off with CC, but I felt that the issue had been resolved with TJ on Sunday. I guess not.  It seemed to me that she wanted to be exclusive. Yet she still wants to be friends. Exclusivity is not in my definition of friendship. I told her that if they had been upfront with me from the beginning, that they wanted to get to know each other without any weirdness of having me around, then I would have felt a lot better than the situation that occurred. As it was, when I thought that TJ and CC were going together, then found out that other people went, I felt awkwardly left out. I felt deceived. Had I known the situation, I probably would not have wanted to go.  Then I was talking to TJ later today and mentioned that I was not the happiest camper since I thought she and I had resolved everything about rockclimbing, but that she went and told CC what I was feeling. I feel as if she betrayed my trust. I also feel like I'm in 7th grade!  The bottom line... I want TJ and CC to be happy. If they make each other happy, terrific! I hope nothing stands in their way. It would also be nice if the three of us could remain friends. Our friendship seems to be on shaky ground at the moment.

      Today I realized two things that don't necessarily make my life any easier, just a tiny bit less complicated.   1. I am just now entering the mourning stage for the relationship that ended in February.  This really hit home this afternoon when me & Heather and her new girl were watching Harry Potter and they were cuddling and holding hands and stuff. I found it quite difficult to handle.   2. A corollary to #1: I am no longer the most important person in anyone (that being Heather)'s life. That hit home last night when we were talking and she no longer was willing to make plans around me and my schedule.   Knowing the truth does make things a lot less complex. It doesn't mean I don't hurt, but it does mean that I can move forward from here. What I find odd is that Heather went through this mourning stage way back in Feb, when I felt pretty much numb. It's strange that all of a sudden, 5 months later, I feel a twinge of regret.

      Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I am never ever up this late, and I don't have a burning desire to go to bed.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I got into fights with not one but two Heathers.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I wish there was someone I could call and talk to but there's nobody  Nobody to call at midnight, or 3 in the morning, depending on what part of the world you find yourself in.  That used to be my mark of a good friendship. And maybe it still is. I just don't have one.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because the waterfall of tears that has been welling up for months has finally broke loose. The cascade runs down my nose.  And nobody knows it's time to call. Nobody knows, and everyone sleeps. Lately I've felt closest to people far away.  I don't want to be oversensitive. I just want someone to care. Someone who invites me to go rockclimbing when the whole big group is going rockclimbing because they know I love rockclimbing.  Someone who tells me that seeing me takes some energy because I'm not a frog on a log. Someone who tells me that when they're exhausted they'll go to bed, not that they don't want to make plans then have to cancel them.   dinner at home and a rented video doesn't require any energy, especially if you were coming here. it also means that if i get really exhausted i wouldn't have to be stressed out about breaking plans with other people   How do you think that makes me feel? How does it make me feel that L, M, and C plan to go to Planet Granite so they can hang out with H? "Give them a break, they're trying to be friends with both of us! They hung out with you last weekend, they want to hang out with me this weekend!" Is there a reason we can't all hang out together?  CC seems to control the game. I'm not sure I like that about her.

      I was lucky enough to have Kaf visit me today! I hadn't seen her in a year and a half, and not for a year and a half before that, when we saw each other all the time. Today I was reminded how great she is and of all the wild and crazy adventures we had together.   I was also reminded how skilled she is at Scrabble-- though I won today's game, we did have a 500-point game. I only won since I started the game with a Bingo.   Wild and crazy adventures...  -driving to Maine for the day to visit the guy we were both stalking (stopping at Phillips Exeter Acahdemy on the way) -playing Scrabble at midnight on a hot night in Providence while drinking Smoothies  -running in the rain  -playing Trivial Pursuit  -making Smoothies at the Ivy Room  -going to New York on New Year's Eve in 2000, but getting so cold after a few hours of standing on the crowded street that we decided to leave and watch the festivities on TV -the everyday conversations. I miss those the most.   Why is it that I can't remember important conversations I've had with H or H, but I can remember every word Kaf says? Why do I feel eloquent and intelligent and intellectual when I'm around her? I wish I felt those things more often.

      During lunch today I was in the car with my boss and two colleagues. My boss had some extra tickets to the SF Giants baseball game. I mentioned that I was interested in going to the game, so she asked if I would bring anyone with me. I said yes. She asked, "Significant other or girlfriend?"   "Yes, both."   She paused for a moment. "Are you trying to send me a secret message here? Are you trying to tell me something?"   "I don't know-- are you listening?"   Meanwhile, my colleagues and I are cracking up!   NR came to the rescue. "Yes, she is."   Boss: "Well, I just want you to know that I'm ok with that. You can be whoever you want to be." (a little defensively, I thought! as if she were trying to convince herself that she's accepting of diversity)  We'll see what happens next. I imagine she'll tell TJ's mom, which will open a whole new can of worms. TJ says she's ready for her mom to know, after all, we've dated for four years!

      Texas. Where condoms are displayed prominently in drug stores (next to the check-out counter) and airports.  Texas. Where the per capita number of pickup trucks is higher than every other state.  Texas. Where an astronaut floats over McDonald's.  Texas. Where you can show your handgun license to get past the NASA security guards instead of a driver's license.  Texas. Where it's so hot that you feel like you're walking into a sweaty blanket when you walk outside.  Texas. Where you can buy fried okra in the cafeteria at work.  Texas. Where they eat vegetarians for dinner.  Texas. Where astronauts play and learn how to fly.  Texas. It's growing on me.

      Earlier this afternoon, as I was sitting at my desk, I noticed some birds were squawking outside the window and making a lot of racket! I didn't pay much attention, but I did notice that Vera (my brother's nice cat) was sitting out in the backyard.  As I was fixing dinner, I saw a tiny bird out on the grass stretching its wings as if it were learning to fly. How adorable! When I went to investigate further, I noticed Vera watching the little baby bird carefully, too. Vera started walking towards it, and both of the parent birds swooped down from their perches on nearby trees and squawked at her. Frightened, she dashed under the trampoline in the backyard.  Finally, I scooted her inside so that the baby bird could get back to its nest.

      "Don't fear too many things-- it's dangerous Don't say so much, you'll ruin everything Don't worry yourself into a corner, and Just don't think about it so much.  The girl you're gonna meet doesn't look like anyone you know And when you meet her, your toes might tingle Or you might suppress a yawn, it's hard to say Don't box yourself in Don't leave yourself wide open Don't think about it every second, but just don't let yourself forget  The girl is out there."  from  Go Fish

      Went to the Stanford Theatre for the first time the other night to see some old 1940s movies!  Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948) involves Joan Fontaine's character as a stalker of a pianist. I could relate! Not in quite the same way, but lately I've felt a little like a stalker (haunted by an old love), and a little like I've been stalked! (Not in a bad way.)  Rebecca (1940). Wow! Joan Fontaine again (she's pretty cute!). A comedy, a romance, a drama, a mystery, a suspenseful thriller. Mrs. Danvers is probably the most creepy character ever! (A lesbian friend at work is convinced that Mrs. Danvers is one of the first lesbian film characters!)  I just didn't like the fact that the female characters in both of these movies were so attached to the men in their lives! Their happiness seemed to revolve around the men. Almost sickeningly so!

      From an email sent to all of the employees at NASA Ames. The acronym cracks me up!  TO:    Resident Staff  FROM:   G. Scott Hubbard, Center Director  SUBJECT:   Prohibition on Feeding Pigeons due to Air Strike Hazard  Feeding pigeons and other wildlife causes over population, creating an imbalance in their natural habitat.  This imbalance not only threatens wildlife, but can also present serious dangers to humans.  There are now large flocks of pigeons at Moffett Field that increase the likelihood of collisions with aircraft, and risk the loss of human life.  Recently Moffett Field experienced two severe Bird Air Strike Hazard (BASH) incidents from flocks of domestic pigeons.  On the weekend of July 10th, a Navy 737 and a California Air National Guard C-130 struck flocks of pigeons at the airfield.  The 737 sustained considerable engine damage while the C-130 sustained both engine and airframe damage with an estimated cost of $1.6 million.  Every year aircraft are downed in the United States and throughout the world from bird strikes, in some incidents causing fatalities.

      I was chatting with Merrie and making arrangements to bake cookies with her tonight.  JB: "What should I bring?" M: "Well, I was thinking about baking some shortbread or sugar cookies, the kind that you have to roll out. So do you have any cookie cutters? You seem like the kind of person that would have cookie cutters!"  I do! But the last time I used them, it was a royal pain. So we're going to bake peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips instead.

      I realized why I wanted to be in the back of the kayak. I had lost control of the situation with Ellen, and I needed some way to regain it. The person in the stern is responsible for steering the kayak and determining where it goes! I appreciated that last night.
