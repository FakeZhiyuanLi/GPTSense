        urlLink   these guys go to this kid's house. his name is brandon or maybe brendon. he has no friends, he's sixteen, he says he's been playing drums for about a year. he's into slipknot. etc.  matt says, "he's sixteen and he has no friends. hopefully he's good."  he's not. he's worse than me on drums. about twenty minutes into this audition, you can catch a glimpse of matt thrashing like he's never thrashed before. and suddenly his guitar string breaks.  then he picks up his phone and strolls into the other room while talking into it. a couple minutes later he has to go home cuz his mom is buggin' him about something. but not before both josh and matt jump on drums and do at least 10x better than the one who's been playing drums for a year.   everyone drives to josh's house and discuss how bad it went.  urlLink then josh grabs the bass amp's platform and boogie boards down the street on it . and will hoge plays in the background. and jordan stops him before my car gets damaged.  matt calls up anthony and says, "please make me feel better. let us come over, and just play drums for us."   so the next few hours are spent at anthony's jamming to whatever we can think of. and the world is better again because any ear-splitting (in a bad way) drum players are forgotten. and the world is made whole once again.  tomorrow there will be a different set of musicians, who don't play taking back sunday or saves the day or green day. and there will be a pool. and beer. and more than one person over 21. and i may have already mentioned this, but there will also be a pool and beer.    -- jay v plays the fool

       urlLink   part of my sleeping brought me to some place where i was sitting in front of a fridge and some lady was fixing my hair, like, spiking the front.  another part of my sleeping brought me to somewhere completely unfamiliar -- supposedly in south jersey. bob harris from lower bucks hospital and john shaughnessy were in the dream. how bob harris, a big man at  urlLink lbh  in more than one way, fit in my tiny bmw is a mystery to me. how he got out when the car broke down, i have even less of a clue. we were following joe caliva and his ragtag caravan somewheree. i can't remember.  the thing wouldn't move whenever i let go of the clutch and hit the gas. it just sort of made funny noises, and maybe decided to move three feet.  and then the cops were trying to get me to move, but they wouldn't approach me or anything. they were signalling to get out of the way, so i got out of the car and watched a fire truck fly by.  and then i hiked back to the gym we started our driving at, and there's my brother sitting at a fold-up table. he calls me asking dumb questions about why i'm not helping him with his car, and i scream, because my car is fucking busted! and i throw the phone right at him, and it bounces off the wall and nearly shatters.  never mind the fact that he calls me on the cell phone while he's right in front of me. and never mind the fact that i can't hear him except from the cell phone.  and then when i pick up my phone and turn it on and it's not working properly, the only thing i'm sad about is that i lost will hoge's cell.

      so john faye and his power trip are comin' back to town. right now they're in atlanta, doing the living room and playing at piedmont park. but next friday night they'll be at the pontiac grille with omnisoul and jealousy curve. i don't remember where i heard jealousy curve, but they're a-okay in my book. show starts at ten. i'm gonna go and whoever else wants to will go as well. js does a cool cover of 'deathbed' and recently i've been taking a liking to 'revenge.' and no, i haven't gotten past side 1 of the cd.   urlLink 1  +  urlLink 2  +  urlLink 3  =  urlLink 4

      so i might stutter around you and act nervous and awkward. but don't take it as a sign that i like you. there's actually someone else i'm interested in. she's cute, and she's funny, and she's hyper, and she could be just as clumsy as me, and she likes punk rock music and she has a smile that's goofy and sly and sexy and honest and exciting all at once. and for some reason i'm not as unfunny and not smart around her as i am around other girls.  so, yeah, i'm not the antisocial boy asking a girl out for the first time in his life, even if i look the part. i may be fooled by your looks into acting like a fool, but it's all just an act. even if i can't help it.

       urlLink   the lyrics are kinda weird and not too great but for some reason i like the song. i wrote the first line based on a dream i had starring  urlLink ms. bunny mci . sometimes i wonder if that had anything to do with it. but then i realize, no, i just like the song because of the tattoo verse. that and i get to sing emo-vocals again. i used to say dashboard vocals. but thanks to matt i'm referring to getupkids vocals now.    you met me on the corner  you reprimanded me for drinking your last beer  you led me out into the courtyard where we waited all day   i found you in an irish bar so i bought you another cooler  i told you pretty lies custom tailored to fit you until we went back home  and all the things we'd done   after all, you want me, i want you  after all, you show me, i show you  after all the darkness hides the truth, after all  what's the hurry after all?   the tattoo on your back, now covered by your shirt  i ask you what it means, you say, "in chinese it means 'cycle.' and next to it is 'love.'"  i touch you where it meant love but now you shy away  you were my shining light under the covers   after all   i touched you where it meant love    -j. vertucio

      i wake up to preston and steve talking about playing dodgeball with marines. oh those y100 morning show people. they're so ballarious. i roll over and almost crush my cat. well, that's not true. he's a big cat to begin with. so if anything's gonna happen, he's gonna wake up, meow, and fall off the bed. last night i dug up the only electric six song i have on my ipod and listened to it. the song has like four lines of lyrics or something. i wanna be able to write a song that just has the words    Girl, I wanna take you to a gay bar! Let's start a war! Start a nuclear war! Now tell me do you have any money? I wanna spend all your money at the gay bar! I've got something to put in you! you're a superstar at the gay bar!   and it still sound awesome. i want to know the secret. i think i know the secret. it's writing good music. it's having a good band that can come up with and play stuff like the opening riff the one abe lincoln plays in the song.

       matt jumps into the car and we drive to collingswood, new jersey. rob has a big discussion with matt about cold drinks and what's good and getting an iced cappucino probably wouldn't be good because the foam is hot and it woulc clash with the frozenness of the iced coffee.  ben asks me to sound check for him. so i do "die on the moon" for him. and forget my version.  and mike caulfield does stand up. like stand up comedy, but apparently matt had better comedy than mike.  shannon cole chooses "crazy beautiful" over "What the Hell For" because i said so. and her new song, she wrote two years ago with her mom. joe once again plays guitar for her, and she was more fun in wildwood. maybe the twenty-foot stage helps.  i hate the fact that i actually can't remember how my new song goes. i sit there and strum but the only think i can think of is radiohead. everyone laughs at me so i do green day.  everyone likes "I Touched You Where It Meant Love" and i think it's jerzey jung who says, "i love your voice." shannon says the same thing. and i feel bad admitting that it's not my normal voice.  although lately it is.  i wanna be a rock musician. and a rock singer. and i'm singing like a freaking emo kid.  cherie keeps yelling "she bangs" cuz apparently i sing like william hung.  and rob shares some of his awesome home-brewed porter.  the best part of the night is, while at puffersomethinger's, i drink a black & tan out of a pint glass that says rolling stones, has the napster logo, and then fender on the bottom.  the worst is finding out that sparrows tried spelling 'fuck you' on my windshield with their own shit.  luckily they (a) don't know how to curse properly, and (b) didn't eat enough.  my windshield just had "FY."  and worse than that ........ i found out i ran out ot windshield wiper fluid.  we pass by some place that's closed, and it's got this sign with a neon chicken, advertising buffalo wings & burgers. i think that'll be a great place to shoot our first music video.   and then i wish cluck-u chicken was still around in bensalem.

       urlLink bunny  mentions it's her birthday and i find it weird that i know it's not. but at any rate i know it's not. i wonder if that makes me someone who has a good memory or a stalker.  oh wait.... buying a ticket and going to athens makes me a stalker. or a failed stalker when i go to athens for the weekend and don't even find her.  i call matt and he says he's free. so i'm driving him to collingswood. he can see the wonderful and amazing sarallen and then john shaughnessy might sing a song about how smoking will kill. unless he does it first. the killing, i mean.  it's also his chance to see cynthia bennett. i never said anything about anyone. but i guess i'll have to brief him on everyone. cynthia sure is something all right. that's for sure.  and here's a ticket on my desk from when i saw 'mean girls' with karen smith. the real karen smith, not the one from the movie. i think if i were a 17-year old girl i'd buy it on DVD.  but, no. i'm looking forward to buying star wars and the passion on DVD. and zoolander. and fallen. and other cool DVDs like that. i also need to get some of those cool rock-concert-on-DVD DVDs. any suggestions? i do plan on getting the matchbox twenty one, cuz i happen to like that band. or i did back in the day.  tomorrow me and brady and mike are gonna go to bennigan's and find out about this passport club thing. hopefully i'll be able to drive home after that.   update : this passport club thing was discontinued about five years ago.  i dunno how i'm gonna break it to the guys.

      the good thing about today is i found out that nina stiefel likes "a lost cause."    ive been singing it for almost a week and a half now. i played it for a bunch of my friends and my mom and they love it too...   the bad thing about today is that ernie crushed my finger with a shelf at work today.   no cool blockquote to fit in here   oh well. at least this "I Touched You Where It Meant Love" thing sounds kinda cool and I don't need my right-hand's ring finger to play it.

      i got this cool thing going on right now ...... it's got a progression that's like E - C#m7 - Bsus4 - Asus2/add9 ....... and then the chorus section is this weird A - C#m - E - B (do the add's and sus' and 7th as necessary), and then i added a C#m - E - A - B bridge a few minutes ago. and it sounds cool, if a bit emo. and now all i need are non-emo lyrics to add to it. and then i'll have a song.  i wrote a non-emo song earlier this month, and then today i brought the key down from E-major to B-major. it still has the musical stylings of a good emo song. it seems like lately i can't get away from that sound.  and then these kids i'm gonna be playing bass with (i make it sound like i'm already in the band because they really want me in it and i sorta wanna be a part of it) ... they're working with the general young-people sounds, like hardcore emo, screamo, etc. i dunno. as a matter of fact, matt's the one who mentioned my apparent get up kids influences. even though i don't listen to the get up kids.   urlLink get up kids  +  urlLink racecar  +  urlLink averi

        things i've learned over the weekend:   1. even if it doesn't look like they're listening, they are 1a. make sure to give it 100% 2. time to learn how to cook. or at least smoke marlin on a grill. and turn it into a taco. 3. wanting to be somewhere at noon means you leave a hell of a lot earlier than noon. 4. kids are gullible. 4a. they really should pay a buck for their gullibility. 5. moorestown mall sucks. 5a. vanilla milkshakes are good. 5b. there's no real decent place for ice cream. 5c. if there is, it's tucked away in a corner. 6. sleep is nice. 7. guilt trip someone well enough, they invite you to their new apartment. 8. time to start participating in drinking games. 9. i rock at poker. 9a. even when betting money -- well, hypothetically. 9b. hopefully when betting with real money, i still rock. 10. probably not a good idea to leave gear in your car in the middle of northeast philly at midnight. 11. the butterfly effect is one hell of a movie. 12. guinness is still the best stout. 13. salmon club sandwiches from standard tap are awesome. you must try one. 14. dogs obey you. 14a. sometimes you have to wrestle them to the ground to get them to sit. 14b. sometimes you use ASL for "sit" to get them to sit. 14c. sometimes you just say "sit" and they sit. 15. joe...is...crazy. 16. apparently i'm influenced by the get up kids. 16a. i downloaded a couple songs off the internet and haven't listened to them in years. 17. even though they're only nineteen, they could make a cool band. 17a. matt is serious about putting together a fun and entertaining band. 17b. i'm really considering joining. 18. my room still needs to be cleaned and straightened up.  so i guess that's it. ladies and gentlemen, have a great weekend.
