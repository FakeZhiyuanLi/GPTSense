      I always squeeze out the last remaining drops out of tea bags after I left them brewing ( steeping is the technical term) for a while. According to  urlLink this link  THAT IS NOT ADVISABLE!  Why? Because it will bring out tannic acids. Tannic acid causes the tea to taste bitter, the same way when leaving your tea to brew for longer than usual. Phew! Now I know why my stomach gets upset sometimes.  I will place the link at the side (the one that says the obvious...) for you to peruse at your own leisure. Meanwhile, gotta go back to surfing!  Me who still looks for a good book... maybe I'll place a corner for my Book of the Month, that sort of thing...

      Don't laugh! There is such a thing as an  overbrewed  tea.   This happens when you place a teabag (or teabags) for far too long in hot water. The ideal time would be around 3-5 minutes. To get the best deal out of every teabag, you'll want to use a heat-retaining cup or mug such as porcelain and china ones. Boiling water is the best for brewing tea.   There are surprisingly huge varieties of tea, not to mention the ones they call  fusion tea . Fusion tea is what you get when you combine good-grade tea leaves and mix it with fruits, flower petals and whatever you have in mind.  If I am not mistaken, the Chinese also used to add tea leaves into their cooking.  (Chinese: what else haven't they tried in that 3000-odd years?)  I have yet to find this on the Internet, but if I happened upon one such, I will be writing again.  Now moving on to something else, but not certain what should I read now... suggestions?

      Feels like a long time ago since I've created my first homepage. I realised, by the time I was drowned in study and web-updating, that this is not for me. Well, at least for now. I thought I'd rather concentrate on my studies first and then whatever comes, comes.  Today I'm back, and I'm planning to inform of this to my friends and families (SHOCK! HORROR!) - on second thought, maybe not them... yet. But my friends will be the first to know.  Ah... just so you know I'm an avid Agatha Christie reader; you can throw anything at me that has Agatha Christie written all over it and I won't retaliate. It's a wonder that someone like her - if you ever saw her photo you won't believe it either - could have thought of some of the genre's most ingenious plots. And murder mysteries are such a difficult genre to write, let alone to devise a plot around it. I know; I'm sort of a writer myself.  Doyle is another old-time favourite, though his methods are more exhaustive than entertaining. E.A. Poe is one of the earliest, in fact some claimed him to be the creator of both the murder mystery and science fiction (read  The Murders in the Rue Morgue  and  Von Kempelen's Discovery  to find out more). He's still the best, and I never experienced true terror until I read  The Raven  a few years back...  Fanfiction (for those who saw the word for the first time today) means writing about a movie/comic/storybook/anything else you can think of the way you want it to be. Some of the most famous including the X-Men (convoluted storylines are the greatest sources of fanfiction), anime, manga, the Harry Potter books (JK Rowling actually encouraged this activity! Score for the ficcers and Harry Potter manias worldwide - myself included!!!) and the movies. In a sentence, it's writing a fiction about a fiction. Makes sense? No? Then go to the Fanfiction.net via the link at the side. I'm Hemlock, by the way if you're curious. I can't tell you what I'm writing about now - you gotta check them for yourselves.  A few days ago I came across a novel by Dan Brown. It's called  The Da Vinci Code . I'll try to fit everything in a nutshell. It's about a professor whose expertise is in symbols and their arcane meanings called as a suspect/witness when the senior director of the Louvre Museum was killed in a very strange way. Later he found much, much more besides great art: that the big L was hiding a lot of things behind his masterpieces, and even the great Mona Lisa has her (or is it his? I'm really confused by now) own secrets, smiling enigmatically from behind those age-old canvass. It's a great book, and though I haven't had the chance to really read it through, I know this book is a very good one. For one, it has incited controversy among the Christians. You can look for more of it in the Internet. Maybe later on I'll add the links for you to go and decide for yourselves.   I've always loved mysteries, hidden meanings and the fact that everything can be interpretated in more ways than two (hehe). I've always have a soft spot for anything that takes a lot of time to figure out. The hieroglyphics were my favourite posters, and I'd spend hours merely staring at this one big poster in my bedroom wondering what could they mean; were they are hidden doorways into some other secret places?   When my friend pointed out that the poster was depicting a passage from the book of the dead, I pulled it down as soon as he was gone.  This month, I've been discovering a lot of stuff. I've never listened to Alban Berg before - he was one of those great modernists, with strange tonal-atonal stuff going about. Although I've read about his opera  Wozzeck  (or  Woyzeck ,  Wozzek , depending where you hail from) it was only a scratch of the surface. When I'm done today, I'll be listening to the full opera.   I've always wanted to listen to  Wozzeck  because it was an unconventional opera in every sense. When it was premiered, everybody thought it was strange, bad taste and eventually it almost became obsolete. Someone had the fine thought of reviving it and it was hailed as a psychological study of a man who was a very big loser. Something like that.   I'm bad at synopsis, but suffice to say that there are no screaming divas or happy endings. Again I must say that  Wozzeck  is not your typical opera.  Yeah... I think I'll hang up for now. Maybe next time I'll bring on some links to my favourite anime right now, Naruto, and all sorts of other links. G'bye!  Me who currently reads  Sophie's World...

      Yes, I'm not talking nonsense. I just thought of a cool stuff to blog about:  TEA!    What?...  I know, many of you are not tea lovers out there, but just look in the internet. There are probably a higher rate of websites dedicated to coffee than tea! And I just happen to be a tea lover - ah, glorious tea...  So for the next few days I'll be happily browsing about in the Internet or anywhere that may have any information on tea. I'm making tea as my main feature. Maybe I should change the blog's name, too...  Still reading  Sophie's World ...
