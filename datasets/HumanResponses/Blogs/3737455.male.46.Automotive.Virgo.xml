						   I caught this Longnosed Gar on May 28th, 2004. It's the biggest one I've gotten all the way in the boat so far. At this point in time I did'nt fully realize just how sharp a Longnose Gars scales are. While I held it up for Timmy to take a picture it suddenly started thrashing and carved a nice cut into my little finger and the rest of them too. Now, I use two gloves on the bigger ones. You see, Longnose Gar have large very thick scales on them. Each one is like a thick layer of emanel with a sharp edge on it. It's no wonder that this fish has survived for some many years. I really does'nt have any natural enenies except for man.

						   Just recently I took a couple of friends fishing for Longnose Gar. It was their first time. They had just spent half a day out on West Point Lake fishing for Largemouth Bass with barely a bite when I called them on my cell phone and told them I would meet them at a bridge to show them where I catch Gar. We spent about 1 hour trying to locate them and then suddenly there they were. And quite a few of them too. I coached them on how to retrieve the homemade lure that I provided for them.  It's a hookless lure!  About that time Derek hung into one. It was on after that. We caught about 10 Gar with the biggest going about 6-8 lbs. Here's one that Derek caught.   I'll tell you one thing, after that day both Derek Pike and Travis Duncan are totally and completely hooked on Longnose Gar fishing  minus the hooks of course .

						   I've discovered over the past year that a huge sportfishing opportunity has been overlooked on West Point Lake.  Longnose Gar Fishing!  That's right. That may seem odd to some fishermen, but don't knock it till you've tried it. After all, they pull like a race car, they jump like a tarpon, they tailwalk across the water, and grow to be very big as well. What more could you ask from a sportfish? I believe the reason they are not pursued as often as Largemouth Bass or other sportfish is because of the fear factor involved in boating one of these hard fighting prehistoric creatures with a 8 to 10-inch beak full of needle sharp teeth. Lets face it, when you do accidentally catch a Gar you're never prepared to handle one. This is why I've set up this information site, to post my fishing success as well as educate fishermen who may enjoy learning about how to catch a Longnose Gar. Believe me. It's very exciting fishing.  And you don't use hooks.     Click on comments  a the end of any post to add your input.

						   I Went fishing by myself on my normal Tuesday off. I'm still using the 1/2oz bullet weight with my homemade rope lure. This time I thought I would stop in at the Pic Nic Basket Bait and Tackle Shop to pick up some red dye with garlic scent. I used it in the spring with good success but I've been out for some time now. I'm not sure if the dye did it but I caught my biggest Longnose Gar of the month using it. It had to weight almost 15-20 lbs. Talking about a chunk now! It was about 50 inches long&nbsp;and fat fat fat! I wished I had someone with me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take a picture of me with this&nbsp;awesome specimen of a&nbsp;fish. I tried to hold&nbsp;it while I set the timer on my digital camera but as I held it off the side of the boat in case it got rowdy that's just what It did and&nbsp;Fatty slipped from my hand and into the water. I guess that's better than getting bite trying to do something that difficult.

						   Timmy and I went fishing Sunday morning. I decided that today I would use a 1/2oz bullet sinker because I felt that the lure was not sinking as fast as the Gar were descending after coming up for a gulp of air. As usual by 9:00am the Longnose were surfacing in about 15-20' of water. They didn't seem that big in the beginning, but as time went by the big ones started showing the beaks. I hung one early that got off because Timmy and I got our lines crossed up and while trying to get out of a mess I didn't let him take it long enough.&nbsp;After that&nbsp;Timmy caught about a 5 pounder. Then about 10:30am this one came up almost right beside the boat. As the big Gar took a few bites off of the water surface I tossed my rope lure about 3-4' out in front of it and gave the lure a few short pumps, and as the lure dropped he nailed it.&nbsp;Now that was&nbsp;pretty cool to see all of this about 10' out in front of us. Timmy said he wished he could've caught it all on the camcorder so that our friends could've saw what we did. An awesome sight!  &nbsp;

						   Timmy and I spent the day Gar fishing. It proved to be a very frustrating day for us. We caught a few small ones but had to endure watching a bunch of large Longnose surface for a gulp and then go right back down time and again all around us all day long. We just couldn't seem to catch them. Except for this one Gar. Timmy placed his rod in the rod holder to take a leak and as he was shaking so was his rod tip. Here's Timmy's skillful catch.

						   My daughter in law Julie Monteith on her first Gar fishing trip lands a nice 3-4lb Longnose Gar. I showed Julie the fishing show, O'neill Outside, featuring Longnose Gar lake guide Terry Smith on the Coosa River weeks before our trip. She remembered Terry showing O'neill how he uses a hair brush to brush the rest of the nylon from the teeth of a Gar. He told O'neill he called it "grooming your Gar". So here's Julie grooming her first Gar.  .
