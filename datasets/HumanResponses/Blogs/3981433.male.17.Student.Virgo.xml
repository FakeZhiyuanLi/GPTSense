      woohoo! got the haircut!  I would post a picture but i know people would nab the picture and do stoopid things to it...so if u want one - emails me and i might grace you with one..  went and saw the brother in colchester, the other one also came in from london so dad, rob, ant, mo, nana, yana and lil jacob all got together and had a lovely dinner. Jacob was sweet - hes talking really well now. Everyone was really happy and jolly, shame mum didnt come - things are going a lil downhill in that department - and she inflicts it on herself...  anyway...claires off soon so i'm gonna miss that...Becca was happy to get the big brother results i txt her and i need to do the dormer essay and re writie that one for the stupid gay fucker maughn  otherwise its all good...oh yeah and gem loves my new hair!

      Spent the day watching films.  Eurotrip, Garfield, Old School and Black Rain....not a bad day's work really.  ok its 12.31am and i wanna go to bed so i'm gonna make this entry brief:  yesterday was crap, mainly cos it was the folk's wedding anniversiry and they didnt go out or have fun or even talk nicely bout eachother...so that was a bit of a downer.  today was nice, slow, relaxed yet damn boring - shoulda done some work, coulda gone for a haircut...but no i sat on my ass.  Claire was also sweet - she told me her feelings and apparently she was talking about me constantly - shes so...words cant describe!  Haircut tomorrow hopefully!

      woke up, watched garfield, had a pizza delivered, went to the park, came home got changed for k-fu, went to k-fu, watched tv and here i am...thats the extent of my day...  watched a good film with Jonny Depp tonight...The Nineth Gate - good - but the ending lacked substance - quite a hot angel girl thing though...  anyway...why do girls find Jonny Depp so hot any way? i've never understood it - maybe its the deep kinda course voice - i have to admit that does sound kinda cool....still bewilders me how some guy oin a film can turn anyone on...  so i sit here...topless, in my jeans, uncomfortable in the summer night humidity typing in my blog, talkin to larm and scratching a gnat bite on the back of my hand; trying to think of things to say...  i really need to tidy mmy room - its a bit of a mess - dunno what i'm gonna do with all of it i suppose i could sell it all on ebay - although i would be underage for that...  i actually cant stop thinking about claire...just yeah well i dont wanna gross you out with all the details....  i really need a haircut too...really really cant be fucked to get it done. i'm having luck with long hair - so i mightkeep it that way - kinda depends on if i ever go to southend JUST for a haircut - which isnt gonna happen...urgh so tired...

      mmm so as usual i'm not told whats happening during the day....so i get up at 11.30 to find that i've gotta answer the door to my adopted auntie (the very very sweet lady that she is) in my PJs!  so i get washed and dressed, have lunch and say bye to my aunt after lunch....great time for a nice relaxing afternoon...  went to the park to meet marco and the gang. White "gay asshole" Mike and drug face turned up - biggets pair of assholes i've ever met. anyway...they left, the Basketball courts and we (marco and the rest of the group) went to the field to play some footy....all fun we burried some guys hand in grass, then we played take downs on the girls...  then i got a fone call from the sister asking me to go to the pub with her...  so i went to leigh went to the pub and we remenised about life and stuff - was great to talk to her. Wes, her fiancee is such a kid....heard some funny stories - but a really nice guy , and they both deserve a happy future and i hope they get it.  so i come home and watch films till 4am...what a day!

      Best. day. ever. - had a lay in (although that was after i had the worst nightmare ever...) got up atr about 9pm, had some coffee, sorted out my day's doins...went to k-fu. had a slice of pitta for my lunch, went to the park, saw marco and then gang.  we played football - one guy hacked another who was on the same team, whos leg flew up and amacked him in the face! really funny! post that we were with some girls - one who kept making eyes at me and, apparently, had an allowance of Â£200 a week - yeah right...and my bollocks are gold plated... anyway she was making eyes, some chink called Henry was tryin to fight me or marco - marco whooped his ass.  went back to marco's after, had some BBQed chicken and stuff - really good...for once i didnt talk to paulao about politics! instead we differed to jobs and food - which was great! AS USUAL Gay Idol had broken his PC so i had to fix it - i leaft them at 11.45 with instructuions no how to do it - shoulda been ok.  and then i'm told Miss Strawberry has some Strawberry body cream she wants some taste testing done on...so i guess i'd better ablige - dont want to be rude...  but today was so great cos of the lack of alcohol in the park - everyone was having fun and being relaxed and normal with any drink at all! reminded me of the old days - really great.

      decided to go see the sister, soon-to-be brother-in-law, nieces and nephew today.  took me about 40 mins to walk about a mile and a half...not bad me thinks. They're all fantastic.  there must be something in the water because 4 women in the last 24hrs have complimented my looks - so either they're desperate or they're genuine and think i'm hot *confused look* well i'm not gonna argue - just makes me feel better.  Going to rileys soon - should be a laugh. i actually need to live in leigh - it takes me forever to get anywhere.  still havnt got my summer planned yet...i suppose you could say i'm planning to be spontaneous!

      today...date with a girl i know... went great - snuggled in the cinema, laughed and kissed -was all good.  however one of her friends is suffering from Jealous Bitch Syndrome. i cant see what her problem is - shes even cancelled a date we had on monday - well i guess shes just being atypical girl and goin crazy over the smallest issue possible.  bust back to claire who i saw today - shes wonderful - great kisser, great personality and a generally wonderful person. however- i'm not ready for a relationship of sorts yet; but to be honest i'm not sure if she is either.  but spiderman 2...  WHAT A WASTED ENDING!

      why are all stupid, bimbo like, barbie doll, blonde, slag women all the same? they all assume no respect for anyone else and then complain when u dont give them any... bloody hate them  why dont they ever say what they mean? infact do they have some compulsion to speak in riddles? which leads nicely onto them being fake and not being true to their characters.  what annoys me even more is the so-called career-woman who demands the traditional respect from a bloke ie opening doors, carrying heavy things - and they then go on to demand totally equal or superior right in the workplace and home.  why cant they just chose one life and stick with it, without the compulsion to disrespect everyone possible and assume a higher status just be cause they're female?

      Well school's over for the summer...Which now means that all the hooligans of the Essex area  are on the streets and its more unsafe then ever..So watcha wallet.  I found out that the school newspaper has been delayed because of a bureaucratic fuck up....this means i've gotta work my nut off reviewing new films, writing articals and copy editing...  ...Great!  plus i've gotta read a bunch of books for A level studies...i need to redo an essay, and do a new one for bloody english too...classical poetry can have a couplet with my arse for all i care... in what exact way is this ever going to be practical?  But on the good side - its summer. time of sun, sand and sea...or sex as the case may be...time for plently of excercise relaxation and a social life.

      last day of college for this year! thought it was never gonna come...now i have the problem of having to organise a crappy social life...  and yes i am a bit of an introvert before you ask. but thats no real fault of my own...i'm not allowed out during college time which sucks the fattest ass ever... but all my other friends lives miles away or are at different schools &amp; colleges. ok lame excuse but its an arse ache to go anywhere.  Ex-history teacher is writing my UCAS reference. saw his yesterday and he said that i had a good chance of getting into UEA, plus its an unpopular university and thy have great resourses apparently...might be worht a look. Dad's obsessed with pushing me to look at Aber-bloody-yriswith or however the hell you spell it... but the truth is that i'll be the first of our family to go straight from 6th form to university - so its not like he knows what hes really talking about... my fathers not a fool - dont get me wrong - probably just a lil misguided.  oh the shitty weather. oh time for a shower

      ok...its 9pm and i'm bored...chatting on MSN sucks...everyones being boring and not talking much...in fact typing this is much more fun...  why do people have such strange MSN names anyway? for example....(a small selection from my currently online list)   knackered and blunt      Your good in a vacume   IT MAKES NO SENSE! but i can hardly talk - i have some strange ones too.  maybe it shows ur mood...favourite songs perhaps...or even a current theme? why do i care? oh right i'm bored....  so after playion counter-strike for an hour or two to pass the time i come online and find that there hardly anyone's online - what are they doin thats so fun?  on a small tangent now, but i recommend that you NEVER buy a wireless desktop set (mouse and keyboard) they're the most unreliable fuckers this side of the atlantic...bloody things - they keep losing signal even with new batteries and a direct line of sight to the base unit. gimme my good old wired in set.

        Ah so the Blog begins...I sit here watching "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen" I find that Disney cinema is worse than ever....In fact...Its terrible.  and so I switch to The Secret Window. Much better.  Its the last day of school tomorrow - so I thought it might be a good idea to start this Blog now so I catch the whole of the summer. I don't know why...But its the beginning of one school year and the end of another.  When I say school...I mean 6th form college at my old school...But its my current one...You know what I mean right? Well anyhoo I'm studying my A levels, hard work and not much spare time.  "you stole ma story...Well?" hehe the interesting beginning to the film.  getting back on track... Yeah A levels....We join the school again as, pretty much, senior members of the place, we're the oldest and make up the prefects too. Great! One would think...  yet NO! We get treated like immature juveniles who cannot even be trusted to come on site when we have lessons - instead we have to come on site even if we have no lessons in the morning and stay there until we have lessons - great example today - came into college at 8.45am - and I had no lessons till 2.45! I mean what a waste of time - I spent it playing table football or 8-ball pool...fucking rules of this place really suck.  to top it off there's a stupid rule about attendance. If your not in, on the nail, at 8.45am then your not in school. No exceptions. This bloody rule is catching everyone. If your not in on time then you get a phone call or a letter home to check if where you are. the form tutors arnt even nice enough to bend the rules and tick you in...miserable bastards.

      i've resorted to listening to Third Eye Blind again - my "pick me up and make me feel better band".  i'm so nervous about tomorrow - what do i do if they kick me out? i dont wanna be a black mark on the family - i just wanna be like ant or rob - being intelligent like rob and rich like ant.  its not fair! why am i dyslexic - hehe that would be quite ironic if i spelt that wrong - why am i honoured with being of above average intelligence but being unable to use it?  these results are gonna be crap - i'm not gonna go to the uni i wanna go to and i'm gonna end up a bum or something. i dont want this- i just wanna be sucessful like everyone else i know!  ok i'm feeling stressed - the tears are welling - i'm thinking of ways to end it all. not that i wanna but thats how i feel. i'm just not happy with this - my entire life is dictated by some shitty bit of paper an underpaid and undersexed teacher is paid to mark. the merit of intelligence cant be measured in how you answer a question. its just who you are - how you react to situations, how you treat other people and regard yourself.  is getting stoned intelligent? is sex with multiple partners intelligent? is destroying others self esteem and morale?  i mean what you write on paper is what you've been taught to do - not ur personal achievement - that doesnt better society. intelligence is making decisions that benifit all - or just yourself depending on the situation.  i dunno maybe i'm just bitter that i'm a retard compared to all my friends - its just rediculas...  anyway met with rosy today and had some great fun - saw I, Robot and had a coke at peterpans after doing to nasty clothes game at TK Maxx.  need to buy Bill from K-fu a novelty pen from disneyland too....

      mmm hung over - drank waaaay too much wine lastnight. looks about two bottles to myself drinking from a wine box that holds four...  ok apparently this is what happened....  started drinking just asfter dinner...so about 6.30pm...came online chatted away, went and played Counter-Strike...had an amazing game 25 kills to 6 deaths. came back on to MSN got more wine chatting away to everyone...and got another glass while watching "That'll Teach 'Em" on Channel 4. after the show i got another glass...and another....ended up talking to Gem&Danny, charli, Larm and rosy who i'm supposed to meet today. that all told me to go to bed - so i did....woke up at 2 am and was sick in the bathroom sink...luckily mum was still awake and looking after me - Mirical Mum! then i went back to bed and passed out apparently...  not so bad this morning - feeling ok - not too sensitive to light, quite happy and probably still got alcohol in my system

      babysit Chloe today... fun...we watched Orange County then went out to the cinema and watched 13 going on 30.  good film - nice to watch whats her face...the girl from Alias hold her boobs...hehe  i'm such a perv...maube thats because i havnt had any female company for ages - see you readers gotta understand that a guy has needs...usually sexual but just generally feelin loved too...  but in any case i'm now drunk lol - i've doped myself up on the vino with dads permision - its not like i do this too often anyway...i'm quite good like that.  the holiday to disney land is now all organised - all i've gotta do is get hold of an itinary (probably tomorrow) and then we're off to disneyland.  i'm really tense about thursday - results day. what do i do if i fuck up? what do i do if i do well? choosing a uni? choosing a course? what the hell do i do? its all so confusing...  personally i'd happilly just jump off a bridge at the mo - but i keep finding reasons why not to: it could all be alright, family, people who i love etc. life just issnt easy - i mean look at the poor fuckers in the 3rd world - they have nothing but go on living.  told ali that she needs to grow up - fallin in love with someone who lives hundreds of miles away isnt practical - and she should know that by now...i mean shes always feelin sorry for herself - stupid cow....  why are nearly half my online contacts away or busy?

      well i made a decision to get dragged to Kent with dad, rob, mo and Jacob.  why does the car's A/c smell like cats piss? anyway we followed rob to some lil industrial estate in sevnoaks where we had to buy a roof rack.  we sent about and hour and a half tryin to fix this stupid thing to the top of rob's Vitara. so we get it fixed and drive on to our next location.  some farm place in kent where we have to strap a mower trailer to the top of robs car....i'll stick the photos up later...  so once we have this thing on robs car we drive off to Shoream - some lil southend-wanna-be-scum hole. there was no where to park, the beech was just rock, the weather sucked....who needs the bahamas when we have shoream huh? we skimmed stones and  then we went to someother lil scum hole south of london...Opping or someother shitty london suburb...had a great dinner though - nice indian resturant - good food, service etc.  got home at about 9pm...found a fax saying that i've gotta look into the Eurostar arrangements...which looks as if it could all be going to shiit...so thats another thing i've gotta look into tomorrow.

      well the party was good in the end - Noah was happy and got loadsa Spiderman presents. on the downside Sarah had to be taken to hospital because of back pains - seems her lower back was hurting after a fireman's carry from Simon.  The DVD i made went down well though - Rob was impressed and whens to incorperate that in his list of services avaliable.  got home and felt really ill. i felt drunk even though i hadnt drunken anything. so i decided to go to bed and watch Lethal Weapon in bed. I feel asleep at 10pm lastnight...  woke up as 2am to some stupid fucking txt from "SMS.ac" i'm gonna remove my number from that - i have suspicions that they're charging me per txt i recieve too...so that'll stop pretty soon  I have no idea whats going on this week. i think i'm supposed to go the the cinema today - to see shrek 2 or sumthing - not too sure. I'm babysitting Chloe tomorrow...wednesday i think i'm going to the cinema with Rosy...thursday i've got the AS level results...and friday should be Disneyland woohoo!  but today....so not sure whats going on...i could go to brighton...i could stay here...i could......go see hannah or sarah..i could go shopping again...GRR no idea whats goin down. I might give simon a ring - see if he wants to go to the cinema.

      mmm kinda weird night lastnight - charli was drunk and started txting me, rosy wants to meet me this week and ezme txt me at 11.30pm.  i've probably spent about Â£15 in txt this week alone!  i keep having this problem...i seem to deny myself girls...Cassy two years ago, rosy in january, stef in march and meesha the other week...lol i should have just been a real macho, player bloke and just accepted them all...  but to be honest i'm glad i did turn them down. i mean, if i dated Cassy she woulda played me, if i dated Rosy i dont think we woulda got on because she doesnt talk so much, plus shes young compared to me...stef...well too much of a difference in lifestyle, and meesha....hehe DIRTY SHLAG!  i dunno...my choice of women is good enough but i seem to find goodlookin girls threatening - i'm not scared just worried about making a prat outa myself...or maybe i just see all really pretty girls as slags...i mean this is essex...and in the words of mike "finding a virgin is hard".  I dunno i think london is the place to go get the degree, deal in art and finance a fun lifestyle. hehe wouldnt that be cool though? just buying and selling art...making millions...thats so for me!  back to reality...Noah's birthday BBQ today! should be a laugh, gotta show Simon his racing DVD...should be a good day.  hehe nothing better then watching Hollyoaks on a sunday...so funny - why cant life be as funny as it is with Zara, thingy, thingy, thingy and Bom-edd.  ah..cant wait until disneyland - charli's all excited too - gemma...well havnt really spoken much to her but i'm sure shes well excited too! this is gonna be fantabulous! yeah thats right....fantastically fabulous...is that a gay term? anyway...i'm in need of some hugs - hopefully i'll get lots in Paris - with gem and charli it should all be good - hehe i ought to buy a hat from River Island...then walk into the clubs with two birds on my arm...ooo pimp daddy James!  wahey! i can see it now! ROLL ON DISNEYLAND!

We met up with kate later in the day - she was sweet and charming as always...  the 3 of us got stopped by some photographer scout person - wanted some over 18s to pose for a photoshoot in london...so we had to say no lol. feeling chuffed though *puts on sunglasses*

      Met with Ezme today. twas great fun! we bought some pick 'n' mix at woolies and messed around with some funny clothes in TK MAXX (see pic)  anyway i bought myself some naked lady cuff links from debenhamds for Â£10 - i've had this voucher since xmas and i still hadnt used it!  We went and saw The Bourne Supremacy at the cinema - Max Beverton, Tim Daveys and Dan Grovsnor was there - i made them all feel special and gave them all a big wave...perosnally i think there were suprised i was with a girl on not on my jack...  anyway - we try to eat ourway throught his huge box of pick 'n' mix and there was so much we gave up.  the film was great - however the way the camera moves in some of the fight/running scenes can bit a bit jiggily which helps in confusion, but not in being able to see the actual fights/running/ driving sequences.  after the film we went for a short walk along the high street and checked out some shops...we saw some really stupid figureines in Prelude. who the hell would buy them?!  walkin her back to the trainstation she fancies a burger - so we stopped off at Burger King - because i told her that they didnt have mustard, gerkins or relish....she hates them...but as always i was rong and they did! so she endded up goin me the burger...half eaten.  so i drop her off at the station and come home with dad to watch some TV thing on fraudsters...amazing stuff - some guy made Â£50m  in copying Â£20 notes...what a dude...but he got caught so he sucks fat ass.

      ok so dropped round to louise's today - was nice to see her. she seems to have changed quite a bit though - a lot more adament. personally i think its the dominant sex shes been having with Charlie...shes got him whipped.  poor guy.  so post watching Friends with her and failing to make my downloaded films work on her lap top we settled to watch Big Fish. Very sweet film - definatly worth seeing.  Meeting Ezme tomorrow - nice lass - hope shes the same in real life. probably gonna go to the cinema, watch some gay film, might go for lunch depending on the weather, possibly the park - so little to do in southend.  didnt do much else tonight apart from watch lads army. really funny. all these "hard-ass" criminals getting kicked is just so....reassuring.  whats with all these bloody gnat bites on my legs and feet? hey look nasty - if i wanna go swimming in Disneyland they better heal up pretty quick - time to get the zinc pills out.  Mums gone to hastings for a few days today - seeing her brother. so i'll hava nice relaxing weekend and stuff - however i might have to skip kung-fu on saturday - i've gotta pick up money from charli and gem for disneyland...which could work into a bit of a muddle.  well off to bed now - got a long day of entertaining ahead....OMG some photos rosy sent me today are just....*dribble* you get the idea...and she says shes ugly...wtf is with that?

(ps she's 15 you bloody paedophiles)

      was convinced into driving into leigh today - as usual dad's eyes were too busy looking at the surroundings to tell me where to go...  found the place, bit shakey - wasnt too pleased so i stopped and dad drove the rest of the time.  thinking in the passenger seat gave me time to reflect on the situation. do i really wanna drive? i'm not very enthusiastic about it - infact i almost dread having to sit in the car - not because i'm nervous, but because I dont wanna be there. i think it could be a social reason....i like 2 seater Roadsters and motorbikes...i think with cars...because you can fit more people in them therea more opinions....i dont like opinions either - unless i can hava gentle debate about them...  k-fu was good today - i got tackled by big terry though...which was quite funny.  urgh nice relaxing evening now....SO LOOKING FORWARD TO DISNEYLAND

      saw gem and charlie today - gem was sweet and didnt appear to hold any major feelings for me still - which is good cause the last thing i want is for her to demand me lol.  Lost Prophets rock - listen to their 1st album on the train up to southminster - went quite quickly actually...  managed to find my way through southminster to the magical house of Gem and meet charli and gemma. we all just talked about random stuff and sat on Gems cool GMTV sofa - really comfy! then everyone layed in my arms and i felt really happy - just laying there with two really good friends.  so we discussed the disneyland details - its all sorted and i should be getting the money this saturday if all goes to plan...  charli is obsessed with the gay guy - Paul. lol why is she so hung up on him? he might be her best friend but hes gay lol....and charli decided to tell me about one of his anal sex exploits...very nasty.  i'm so looking forward to disneyland its untrue - i think its probably because Gema dn Charli are really good friends and we all get on so well....  i dunno i'm shattered - i'm off to bed

      ok so it rained....at 6am...doh  so we still went to Adtenture Island. It was nice to see Shameela again...seems like a bit of a blagger though...telling be about all this cool stuff at uni and how she pulls all these guys etc...bit of a shock really - shes not the quiet, innocent lil girl that i've always known her as...quite the opposite infact.  Still, was nice to see her - we went on all the rides and I got soaked on the Log flume....bastards. she seemed to know all the male ride attendants too...says it all really...although there was this one who she really fancied but was too shy to go talk to...ha! looser!  oo we had moca-frapa-chinos at starbucks too...that was nice - gotta go there more often and fund globalisation :D  had dinner at Pizza Express...the waiters there must be thinking i'm a right man whoere lol...i've gone in there 3 times this year and each time its been a different girl...however i'm becoming a bit of a regular so i might even get my own table soon :D  so anyway...i get home and meesha comes online and tells me shes actually a virgin and she wants to screw me just to lose her virginity...i mean wtf!? honestly i mean come on...shes met me like once and whats my willy inside her...what the hell..NO! anyway...i fancy claire so i cant go and do sumthing like that behind her back.  ...well i could but i'd feel so guilty.  meeting up with Gem and Charli tomorrow to discus the Disney Land thing. and its raining now...and expected showers for the next 24hrs.

      grrr i swear this heat is affecting my mind and bosy - at the moment i wanna screw anything that walks!  stoopid girl mica still wants my ass...she aint gonna get it.  anyway today i stayed at home, watched films and played PC games.  learned that Becca wants to be a total individual - not one of the crowd...that makes her special in a special way...  Talked to Shameela today too - seems we're meeting up tomorrow to go to Adventure Island - probably the worst place to go this year cause of the heat...i hope it rains. shes also trying to encourage me to come to aber-bloody-ryswth or however you spell it...really not that keen on going so far away.  Disney land is looking good - meeting gem and charli on tuesday to discus the actual trip. managed to get a good deal for Â£355 stayin at the New York hotel, including travel and park fees. all we need to buy is lunch, dinner and toys :D

      decided not to go to kung-fu - too hot to walk back - so i went to lunch with dad, simon, nana and sarah.  went to the Plough and Sail pub in Paglesham. really nice place. got absolutly stuffed with food. simon paid for it too - such a decent guy - i wonder why there arnt more of him and me in the world....well that didnt sound big headed at all  bought a good quality printer for Auntie Wynne too....however it didnt have a power cable...so dad bought a Â£20 HP 5550, Â£30s of cartridges and a power adapter for Â£30 - lol not much of a saving now...  went to nanas after PC world, had some fun chats. everyone was knackered from lunch. drove home afterwards with dad...i drive like a pro now!  got home....Meesha (girl from park) told me she fancies me - omg ewww ugliest most slaggy girl ever!

      well...decided to go to Bands Hatch with Simon, Sarah and Dad.  all crunched up in sarahs front seat with her driving in the boiling heat we arrived at the Brands Hatch gates to be greeted by some freaky indian who couldnt speak english...once we parked the car we all got out and met Simons parents...all very nice and friendly.  after asking for directions and getting cameras and milling around for a while we all walked down to the Rally School. we had a breifing from this guy who had a baulbus stomache of about a foot infront of the rest of his chest...telling Simon about the car and basic health and safety measures.  so we go and sit on the Hill and watch him race...hes and absolute pro! zooming round the course in a lil 206...kicked some serious ass. he was even faster then the instructor! i was tasked with filming thw whole event and now i've made a remix of one of simons runs.  so we then went on to bluewater and did some shopping. I bought myself some new sunglasses seeing as my old ones broke...so now i look uber cool! - feels like saturday...

      Piss off with the alarm clock! mum decided to put the alarm clcok in the bather room right next to my bedroom...instead of her room which is down the other end of the hall..so she obviously intends to wake me up WHAT IS HER FUCKING PROBLEM?  didnt sleep well lastnight at all and so i get woken at 6.30 by some stupid cow who wants to dominate my life as if i'm a three year old...  guess it means i can to go Brans Hatch with Sarah & Simon and Dad....simons got this red letter day driving thing so that'll be fun for him - hes a nice guy too (alike wes).  I got some requests for quotes at disney land sent off lastnight at their website - should get back to me later today....but i'll go to Case Olden Travel Agents tomorrow anyway just to get a package quote with travel.  hehe random thought: i wonder how bad my grammar is in this blog....

      well everything sunk.  louise had to cancel the game of pool, and hannah's to tired to play so i've stayed at home all day and just played games and chatted to people  decided to go to disney land paris instead of a cruise. Its gonna be a laugh, i'll probably take charli - shes a nice lass and we get on well...  so yeah tomorrow to the agents - hopefully - then maybe off to play some pool.  grr been so bored all day...  Watched a film called Hidalgo lastnight. its good - really good camera angles, good, believeable story in itself. I think it was based on a true story, about a Mustang vs Through-bred hourses in a cross country race across arabia.  i believe it was supposed to be released last month - never happened - such a good film though!

      not a bad day. finslly went out to the Travel agents at about pm...although we didnt go there i went to my sistera's. there i talked to hand and wes - wes isnt feelinmg too good, really nice guy too. so i missed out on the travel agebts and their worldly advice in exchanged for hannah and the kids...  they're all ok. noah and hidi are all sweet and themselves...Noah wont keep still for 30secs and Hidi just sleeps and drinnks her milk.after that i went to kung-fu where abt 5 other peopel turned up.it waas good because we got more time to work on our personal technique.  everything was great...mum was happy, dad was op...but complaining of a head ache and i'm just me and relaxing for once.  Just after dinner an arguement breaks out about a bloody chocolate bar...a stupid fucking chocolate bar...i mean what the fuck! so now mum is out of her good mood, and dad is sour again - its silly...so i decided to retreat to my room with my good friends alcohol and films.  i think Jenny thinks i like her cos i said she;s pretty - which she is - but i think shes reading into it too much - so screw her...  i miss claire...i want her to come back soon...shes so sweet and lovely...  ooo seeing louise and big sister tomorrow to play some ppol - should be a laugh - apparently hannah used to be on The Grand Hotel pool team...bet shes crap :P  oh great now mum had just burt into my room and stated that shes not gonna do anything of me or my dad because were' "barstards" welll i feel bloody loved! i dunno why she does this - its rediculas, why cant we just be a happy family like everyone else i know? why do we all have to fight and squabble over nothing!? i dunno i just wanna get away go on holiday anywhere just dont wanna be here. i think i might go to uni just to get away from my folks - as much as i love them both they just pain me with their constant bickering and snide comments... no wonder i'm prone to stress if i have this at home and a mental kickin at school too.

      just woke up...its wednesday morning...didnt post one yesterday cos i was too tired after watching a really good film which finished at 1.15am this morning.  but dude! this film...quite freaky - it seems to be based on the California Jail Pschycology experiment thingy...but this one was in german with engllish subtitles...good film - great storyline too - had me gripped the whole way through...i recommend you see it  so yesterday...woke up at 7am! crazy...so i watched Kill Bill and Walking Tall. Kill Bill is the worst film i've seen in ages - it lacks a real moral plot and storyline - its killing for killing's sake. and to be honest i have no idea why anyone would wanna watch it...  Walking Tall was better. The Rock plays the guy really well - u can sense the character. anyway thats well worth seeing.  went to the park afterwards with Marco - was kinda boring to start with - that cool player guy, Simon, was there so it was all good. simons ball got stuck in a tree...  anyway we all moved to the Priory Garden santury place and all just chatted...i met Mica, Jenny, Emily and Sophia. we played with some mascara - just painting everyones hair, Simon's chin, and Rumbos pubes...well thats was all fun - Mica was throwin herself all over me - i think she might just be a flirt - not all that sure - not that i care...just some good clean fun.  Marco went to italy today (2am) told him to bring me back some decent photos of some hot women...  another thing that didnt bug me so much as...puzzle me was Becca. before she went away she was all cute and flirty - now shes all quiet and untalkitve - i wonder if i read too far into what she was sayin - knowin me i probably did....  Back to today - i'm aiming to go to the travel agents with dad - see if we can get some cheap cruise tickets for the med for me and friend. I think i'll take charli - shes a nice lass and we get on pretty well...all the guy frinds have gone on holiday now anyway...i'm not sure if i should take her of gemma tho - however i dont think gemma could get the money together...believe i asked her a week or so ago.  I'd love to take gemma cos shes in need of a nice break, and well i dont really know charli all that well anyway...but i'll take whoever - i'm sure it'll be fun.  mmm wonder what film to watch today...

      So...went out to lunch with dad at the seafront earlier...was nice, we chatted and i got toasted by the sun...some girls at a nearby table kept making eyes at me...so i ignored them...dad forgot to pay for parking but luckily there were no traffic wardens so we got away with it....  can somebody please please tell me why really fat women have to wear skimpy bikinis? they look fucking nasty!  so drove to Marco's place from there (didnt get a chance to walk there in the end) the steering on the car we juddering...turns out it needed some kinda power steering fluid...so anyway...marco wanted to buy a digital camera - so we walk up to PC world and Marco tells me about this really hot lass he wants to date once he comes back from italy...seems really obsessed by her...aww sweet young love...  so anyway...marco needed some cash to cover the cost - he had Â£105. and needed Â£129 so i gave him Â£25...then gave me Â£10 back at the till cos he had a discount card which brought it down to Â£116.79...but the point is he still owes me Â£15 quid...and i'm gonna have to break his legs if he doesnt pay...how i'm gonna do that i dont know...(dont worry marco only kidding......it'll be ur fingers :P)  Marco tried to tech my how to cartwheel and do some aerial kicks....i think i need stacks more practice....jesus...marcos roundhouse kicks can kill you dude!  and know joel is tryin to sell me a shitty PC...just told him to get lost...why should i care if he cant see his girlfriend cos he was too busy spending money on computer parts like a total geek....

      fixed the blog - took a good 30mins...  dad just came back after a fone called from the Doc. - he decided to lecture me on gettin out into the town and making a name for myself acos i cant do it behand a bloody computer screen, however i shouldnt feel pressured and theres no rush and nothing matters.....  BOLLOCKS!  if it didnt matter you wouldnt say it - i mean c'mon if your gonna tell me i need to get out - just say i do dont hide it and try and tone it down behind some stress bullshit...i sick of this constant "its ok" attitude then undoing all of that by telling me i've got to get out the house! its just not making sense...i've gotta drive, gotta go to university, gotta go to aber-bloody-rysthweth, gotta do essays, gotta make mum "proud", gotta choose a career, gotta be the best - this constant bloody struggle to be something i'm not - or something that other people want me to be...I cant live my life - i'm being pushed around by everyone to just live a life thats not to my taking....its rediculas - i need a direct and calling of my own.  I cant find anything thats particularly interesting to me - almost nothing interestes me - i've just lost confidence since that baker letter - being in the Civil Service is looking futher and further away, Business look like it could be fun but I'm not into all the paperwork and stuff - i just dont have a calling!  hehe this blog is turning into my lil counciling session isnt it? i mean it might be open to the world but it just lets me pour our all my worries and problems, stresses and opinions...  argh bollocks i'm gonna walk over to marco's

      ok i've just looked at this stupid blog's settings....it seems it was setting the times of post to USA time....so i've adjusted it to GMT and its fucked it - all the posts are the day after the event - i would spend all day making them correct - but i adjested the date (when they were in USA time) to be UK time....  now i've adjusted the over all settings the whole fucking lot has changed bya bout 12hrs forward - so now all these posts below are a day after the event...  I am not happy...  went to the doctors this morning - stress is getting to me again - not sure how to relax...i'm only on edge cos the headmaster (AJ Baker esq., MA., COCK) has threatened to kick me out the school...so i'm not sure if i should get a job, carry on working or go on holiday somewhere...  so basically now i'm just gonna do my best, try and stay relaxed and ignore everyone...basically be an intovert obsessed with work.  gonna sort these posts out...gives me somthing to do seeing GAY IDOL MARCO SELCI decided to be a wanker and hang the fone up on me when we're tryin to decide what to do...the arrogant asshole.
