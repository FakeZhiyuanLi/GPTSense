      Welcome to my blog... from here on out there will be many thoughts from my head posted for all the world to see on the Internet... scary, isn't it??!?!?  There's no real rhyme or reason to what you will see. Some blogs have topics of great social prowess... this does not.  Feel free to post your own comments on anything you read.  I promise I'll follow up... when I have time.  Life is complex, so I'll give you a really basic idea of who I am.  I live in Indianapolis, Indiana... grew up here - work here.  My wife Karen, is my best friend and the coolest person I know.  We grew up together and were married a couple of years ago.   To add my part to the greater whole of society I take images and sound of people and places and throw it in a blender of sorts and produce television.  The company I work for is great... down to earth, and everyone gets along and believes in going the extra mile. I'm really lucky.    Auto racing is my number two passion aside from the world of music.  Now and again I'll play some on various instruments.   Pearl Jam is the greatest band in the word... Wilco is pretty cool... Miles Davis is stratospheric, and we are far worse off now that Ray Charles has left the world.  Listen to the album Pet Sounds often... it will help you understand your own soul much better... Abbey Road is the greatest album ever, and George Harrison one of the most underrated human beings of the 20th century. Check out "Beware of Darkness" from his album "All Things Must Pass." Pop it in and hit repeat until you "get it"...  Indianapolis is great.  My job allows me to go to many cool places in the world, but I love coming back home to Indiana.  I get extremely sentimental about Jim Neighbors singing "Back Home Again In Indiana" each year at the Indy 500.  Yes, that's good ol' Gomer Pyle, for those of you playing at home.  Racing is cool.  I grew up spending a lot of time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and it's mutated my DNA!   Life is life and people are people wherever they go.  I try to treat everyone like I'd want to be treated.  Question the status quo... it's healthy. ? Don't take tomorrow for granted, and believe in yourself and those around you to make change... anything is possible when people believe in themselves in each other.  Do one thing better each day, and be yourself.  Have faith in bigger things than just you, and you'll be okay.  Nothing written here may change the world, but maybe some will make you think.  More to come...  GAME ON! Doug
