      Now usually I have no problem with yahoo because it lets me search for the stuff I need. But when it comes to my e-mail they're just big poop heads. The reason&nbsp;I say this is because when ever&nbsp;I try to send my mom or any of my friends an e-mail,Mailerdemon sends me my message back and says that I can't send my message to this person. AHHHHHHHHH!!!!! It's beyond annoying. Now I've tried everything that&nbsp;I can think of to make it work. If there was the possibility that&nbsp;I got the e-mail address wrong then&nbsp;I asked them if they could write it down or something so&nbsp;I wont get it wrong. That didn't work. I tried cleaning out my mail box ,because&nbsp;I know that if it gets too full you can't send any mail. That didn't work. I tried not sending them any mail for awhile. That just got my friends mad at me because, that's the only way we keep in touch. As you can see my situation is very serious(well at least it's serious for a 13 year old) and needs to be handled quickly:) so if you have any suggestions please tell me,because&nbsp;I have a comment box now yay:) Plus&nbsp;I need help.  But you have to be a member, so join be happy. If you join that doesn't mean you have to make a blog, but you do have the choice to. Anyway I have to go clean so talk to you later.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bye,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charmed freak

                           Three Monkeys: "Hear no evil, Speak no evil, See no evil" The trio of monkeys is depicted with one having its hands over its ears, another having its hands over its mouth, and the third having its hands over its eyes. Known as the Three Monkeys, they are a tradition in Japanese culture.  Beginning in the late Muromchi period (1333-1568), it became customary to carve these figures on koshinto, stone pillars used during the observance of Koshin. According to the Kiyu Shoran, an early 19th century reference work, the Three Monkeys may also be related to the Sanno belief complex, wherein monkeys play the role of divine messangers. The Three Monkeys represent the Santai (Three Truths) advocated the Tendai Sect of Buddhims. The Tendai founder, Saicho is said to have carved a representation of this ideal in the form of monkeys. (Japan. p. 1562-63)  A famous carving of the Three Monkeys is on the sacred stable in the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, Japan. Carvings of monkeys were believed to prevent diseases in horses.            I thought that this article was very interesting because, I have been wanting to know about this saying for a very long time. So I decided to post it on my blog just in case anyone else was wondering what it ment.        urlLink

      Ok, so I interviewed my uncle about this topic and here's how it went;                                        Me: So a few questions for you about the dating game.You ready?                       Mike: yup                                      Me: So, why DO people act crazy when they date?                              Mike: I guess its because, they always have that little voice in the back of there head that's telling them its going to go wrong or that they aren't good enough for the person that they are dating.                                Me: Ok,so what are some things that you have done to let the person know that you like them.When I say this I mean stuff that you kinda regret doing now?                       Mike: Buying love.itsnot bought, love is shown. Now don't get me wrong, some roses or a nice necklace is good but when they start overdoing it, it just gets to be cheesy and unreal.                       Me: Have you done any other things that have stretched the limit of what you can actually do?                       Mike:Spent money that I never actually had. I've once spent $3,000 on some one and I didn't really have the money to do so.                       Me: Ok, last question, what tips do you have to give to other people on dating dos and dont's?                       Mike: Oh my, umm...Well I would say personally , do more things that don't involve money, like for instance,a walk on the beach,if you don't have a beach near by just a walk in general. A candle lit dinner ,made by you ,not store bought,when I say store bought I mean not from a restaurant. Or make it a blockbuster night,'cause there isn't anything like cudelin' with your hubby and watching a nice movie.                       Me: Ok,well thank you soo much.                       Mike: No problem. Pleased to anwer your question.   So, thats what happend and thats the end of my entry.                           bye
