      I can't stand the boredom!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! No, just kidding. Wait no I'm not, I actually&nbsp;am&nbsp;this bored. I hate coming home after a really fun evening, cause then nothing seems as fun. Especially when you are sad like me and have nothing to do but talk on msn and blog.  Well...today I went out shopping for Corky's birthday present! Oh man 17 for her! She's so lucky! I won't be 17 till DECEMBER! Don't even get me started on my bday. It is in the worst month ever! I'm last to do everything!!! But seriously 17! Its scary we are all getting so old. Not like OLD, old. But we are growing up. It seems like we just met. I remember it well...lol:) Wow, we have like one year of highschool then we are done! DONE! Its kinda weird. Then its university! Sooo cool! But who knows where I'll end up? I'm afraid I'll never see anyone again:(  Anyways....today I went shopping. And I got new clothes from ae! Then after I went for dinner at Earls and sat on the patio. It was soo nice out. And I saw Laura there! That was too cool! Laura is on my track team and she is so nice and funny! She's great! I miss not seeing her 3 days a week like usual. But I'm so glad I have time off from track, its so relaxing not worrying about what I'm eating or how many weekly minutes I'm putting in. And I'm so pumped for x-country now! It shall be grand. Sadly, I can't seem to say the same thing about school. So NOT pumped for that. BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I can't stand the thought of homework again. Its enough to make me throw up. No really. I'm serious.&nbsp;And tests? Oh god, lets not get me started.  So...Earls was fun. Mmmm I had clam chowder, chips and spinach dip, thai wings, and fries. Wow, ok, I just admitted what a pig I am. Seriously, I really should be fat. Track+ high metabolism = skinny Berrit. So its alllllllll goooood! Did I also mention my coke addiction? (NO! Not that kind of coke!). Coca-Cola silly! Ya I love coke. Someone has to cure me of this problem! Someone help me please, for the love of god! Its bad, I had like 3 glasses at dinner! But its soooooooooooooooooooo GOOD! I know... I should get a grip.  Anyways now I am carrying on about random things. Soon, if I don't stop I'll be&nbsp;posting another Avril&nbsp;Lavinge song. And many of you do not want that! LOL:) I hope some of you liked it though. I know one person did;)&nbsp;But I should go do something more useful now. Perhaps I shall put some more effort into my msn conversations. Or I could turn on the tv. Oh the possibilities. How sad is this? I'm telling you, stay away from Berrit. She has no life. Hahaha just kidding! But honestly, if you are young, please, please don't download msn. It ruins your life. I'm serious. If you find people you always want to talk to on it, you will never leave. NEVER. Do you know what that means? A wasted life. A wasted life sitting at&nbsp;the computer. No, I'm just kidding you, but in all truth it does become very addicting. But in other ways I love it, cause I get to talk to my two favorite people in the world (Corky and Joe)&nbsp;a lot more than I would if we lived in the olden days where there was no msn. And seriously&nbsp;mail took like a year to travel to the next town, lol. But then again if it was the olden days we probably would live like down the street from oneanother&nbsp;or whatever and I could just hop on my horse and gallop to their homes. But seriosuly eww. The olden days? I would probably be wearing a calico dress right now and my hair would so not be conditioned, ever.&nbsp;I'd have to wear a corset. I'm sorry but in Titanic when Rose's mother is doing hers up, it just looks painful. No thankyou. I like breathing thanks.&nbsp;And in all honesty...courting? What was that about? Man, if I had to date and bring my father along it would so not be cool. Wouldn't that be awkward Joe? And then also Corky and I could not cruise in her mercedes. Instead we would sit in a wagon and get dust in our hair. And damn we just look hot in the mercedes. A wagon? Calico dresses? Not so much. Give me my mini skirt anytime. Floor length? How about no. But really, what have I been going on about here? I am actually this sad. Oh man this is bad. I'm going before this becomes too embarassing. Ciao for now. (I probably would have got beat for using such slang back in the day). Oh and wait I'm a woman too. Women do not speak unless spoken to. Is that right? Well so much for blogging...

      I know a whole bunch of you out there hate Avril Lavigne. And well...I can't say I'm her&nbsp;biggest fan, but I really do love some of her new songs. One song in particular explains exactly how I feel right now. I was like: "whoa, is avril stalking me?" No, just kidding. But this songs lyrics really impacted me, and the song is really good. So...I thought I would share it. And just to let you know, some people find this song sad, but I don't interpret it that way. The way I see it, the song is about someone who is just so in love, and is totally carried away by her emotions. She's not sad, she's overwhelmed and&nbsp;happy, but she is so caught up in the moment everything she feels just comes spilling out. Well that is the way I feel about the song, and it is the way I relate to it.   Fall to Pieces    by Avril Lavigne and Raine Maida     &nbsp;   I looked away    Then I looked back at you    You tried to say    Things that you can't undo    If I had my way    I'd never get over you    Today's the day    I pray that we make it through    Make it through the fall    Make it through it all     &nbsp;   I don't want to fall to pieces    I just want to sit and stare at you    I don't want to talk about it    I don't want a conversation    I just want to cry in front of you    I don't want to talk about it    'Cause I'm in love with you     &nbsp;   You're the only one    I'd be with till the end    When I come undone    You bring me back again    Back under the stars    Back into your arms     &nbsp;   I don't want to fall to pieces    I just want to sit and stare at you    I don't want to talk about it    I don't want a conversation    I just want to cry in front of you    I don't want to talk about it    'Cause I'm in love with you     &nbsp;   Want to know who you are    Want to know where to start    I want to know what this means    Want to know how to feel    Want to know what is real    I want to know everything, everything     &nbsp;   I don't want to fall to pieces    I just want to sit and stare at you    I don't want to talk about it    I don't want a conversation    I just want to cry in front of you    I don't want to talk about it    'Cause I'm in love with you     &nbsp;   I'm in love with you    'Cause I'm in love with you     &nbsp;   I know this entry was kind of random, but I really like this song, and I felt like posting it. If you listen to the real song its so good. Anyways, I'm going to listen to more tunes, lol, so...later!   &nbsp;

      Yesterday can only be described as wonderful. To feel the relief, the happiness, the contentment. I'm so glad that the uncertainty is gone and that I can focus on the positive; the love. I feel like everything will go right now. What I want to be, will be. Hopefully in the future I will wake up the way I want to. And what I want most will be right there.

      This weekend was honestly the best time ever! I have never had so much fun at a track meet! Ok, so I better explain the whole weekend so you can understand my full experience. Except you won't totally  understand , cause I mean, you weren't there, too bad for you. Hahaha, just jokes.  So...day one was Thursday. I arrived in Okotoks (the games were being held in Okotoks, High River, and the MD of Foothills region). Registration was at Foothills Comp. High School and when I got there I was feeling quite nervous...not just for my races, but the fact I didn't know the people there that well. But all was about to be good. I registered, got my name tag, free backpack, and then headed to my athlete village: Highwood Highschool, in High River. So my Mom and I drove there, I said goodbye to her, and went to my room...room 167! (We stayed in Classrooms at the school). All of the girls in my room I knew, but not that well. I only knew them as my competition from other clubs, not as my friends. But it turned out to be awesome. We all bonded throughout the whole weekend, and it was sweet to get to know these girls better, cause they rock! They are all such amazing athletes, and they are all super nice. So let me explain everything...  Athlete Village: Our rooms were classrooms, and the school was soooo nice. Its like brand new. We all slept on&nbsp; comfy mats, had tvs in our rooms, and had interent access 24/7. The best thing is that you stay with all other track people from your team, so you know them already.The showers at this meet were so funny! We had to shower in ATCO trailers! LOL! It was sooo weird. But the showers were good, and had warm water so I didn't care. Our school was also right by the track so we could just walk out to it. Plus the guys volleyball was taking place at our school so we got to cheer them on to GOLD between races at the track! SOOO FUN! Wanna hear our team cheer? Yeah, you do! "AROO, ANGOWA, CALGARY'S GOT THE POWA!" (as in "power", but POWA rhymes, and sounds cooler!) I know you like it;) HAHA movies were sooo fun in our rooms. it was a Mandy Moore movie festival! Sooo bad, but sooo&nbsp;good! (In a cheesy way).  The Track: "High Quality Track built for Games," is what the paper reads. Yeah, NO. The track was shale. In other words it was crap. And it was slow. Try going from a 5:04 1500m, to a 5:19. Try going from a 11:20 3000m, to a 11:41. Thats right, see how you like it. But it was still sooo fun there. We had to hang at the track all day and cheer our team. Damn, we kicked some ass! Calgary won the meet by A LOT! Thats right Deadmonton, in your face!  The Races: We won't go there...No, just kidding. They were ok, my 3000m was decent. The 1500m wasn't great. HA! The 800m, not even worth mentioning. But ITS OK! I was more concerned about the experience anyways. And it was just AMAZING! And now I know how hard I have to begin training for X-Country. Thats right, throw up after every practice! NO! Just joking. But the intense workouts being very soon. That is after my break...2 weeks of nothing YES!!!  The Food Centre: Such good food! The food here was heaven compared to Legion Camp! Soooo good. All I can say is, yes, we actually got fruit. Unlike some places that feel we can run on bacon and eggs...right. How 'bout no.  The Track Meet: It took place Friday and Saturday! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun! Cheering, hanging out, watching v-ball, hot hot hot weather, sun tanning, heat stroke...lol, our tasty bag lunches (umm...right), dumping our water onto our heads before the 800m ("man we are this sweaty already!?), watching the other events. Just really, really, GOOD TIMES!  The Opening Ceremonies: OMG SOOO AMAZING! Calgary got to march out first and I was in the very front. I'm going to be on TV! Watch me on GLOBAL on Wednesday evening! And then Fefe Dobson performed for us! Wow that was sweet. I mean I'm not a huge fan, but man it was like a FREE concert! So ya the ceremonie was great. It gave you such a pumped feeling to walk in to the stadium with all the fans and tv cameras! So... The torch was lit, people spoke, then Fefe played. It was just an amazing experience one can only hope to have in their life at one point. Man, it makes me want to attend the OLYMPICS one day soo badly! The ceremonies were so inspirational! *Tear, Tear*  Friday Night: Saw Spider Man 2 for FREE! Go and see it! SOOOO GOOD! *Two thumbs UP* Way better than numero uno!  The Dance (saturday night): Much Video Dance! They played the best songs! Best dance I've ever been too! I may or may not have been dancing provocatively. You can decide on&nbsp;that one. Hahaha, just jokes about the may not, it was definitely may. No seriously, it was so crowded you couldn't help dancing with everyone there. I'm just joking about the dirty dancing though, no worries. But ya the dance was super fun! Amazing time was had by all! But there was definitely ass grabbing going on. So many guys grabbed my ass it wasn't even funny. So not cool. LOL!  The Verdict:  TEAM CALGARY WON THE 2004 ALBERTA SUMMER GAMES! WHOOOOO!  Closing Ceremonies: A waste of time. Waited around for 2 hours listening to crap bands. The ceremony took 20 minutes. Can you say wtf?  But in all the 2004 Alberta Summer Games were FABULOUS! I know it is a memory I will always carry with me. I know so few get to experience what I did, and I'm proud that my hard work got me here. Its too bad I didn't perform as well as I could have, but I wouldn't give back this experience for anything! I know I will never forget July 22-25 2004, the year I was 16, and got my first taste of what could lie ahead for me. Olympics perhaps? *Fingers crossed* It was definitely a weekend to remember!  &nbsp;

      Can you tell that something is different? Can you guess what it is? Oooo that's right I changed my blog! Do you like it? I kinda got sick of the old one, even though I had it for like 2 weeks! Oh well, I like this one now.  This evening was really fun! I went to track and did a good workout.&nbsp;I did a 1000m model. A 500m, 300m, and a 200m. Pretty good pace too. 1:37, :56, :35. I'm all set to break 5! But seriosuly my coach doubts I'll break 5 this weekend cause the track is a cinder track! This sucks, cause cinder tracks are always slower. So my new goal is just to win. Who cares about the time? I just wanna kick some ass! I have to get 12's for my spikes now too. Geez. Thats like cross country style. Damn cinder tracks. Considering I wear 7's on a normal track, 12's are going to seem so long. Hahaha! Oh well, its all good. This weekend should rock!  So tonight after track Corky came over and we went to starbucks. She needed to vent after her hellish day at work. One of her kids at her daycamp was the devil! By the end of the day he had sprained her wrist and been kicked out of the camp! Oh man! We had a good time at starbucks eating cookies and drinking our mocha lattes and Strawberry frappacinos though! YUM! Good times, good times! We sat there and talked for like an hour, then I came home and now I'm here! I love how we can talk for hours and never run out of things to laugh about and make fun of. Its so great to have a best friend! The world is a very scary place without that one friend you know will never let you down. Anyways I've written in this blog WAY too much today! I'm outta here! ;)

        Wow, the Alberta Summer Games are fast approaching. I can't believe I'm leaving on Thursday to attend. It should be really fun actually. I'm nervous, but excited. The fact that we all get to be in an opening ceremonies and closing ceremonies is awesome, I'm really looking forward to that. But on the other hand I'm extremely nervous for my races! I really really want to be able to break 5 minutes in my 1500m, but I don't know if its going to happen this season cause my training hasn't exactly been 100%. Its also the mental part too, I really need to get past the fact that I feel tired. I know my body can be pushed through anything, its just my brain that is telling me in tired. But I'm so happy Joe and his family are coming to watch, they have no idea how cool it is for me that they actually want to come and see me run! I can't wait!    Joe and I had so much fun together yesterday! Everything felt right again. We went to the mall for a bit, got Orange Julius and Cookies by George (yum! soo good)! Then we looked around at various stores for clothes and we looked at music in HMV. Being at the mall made me realize how excited I am to go Palm Springs and shop there! OMG they have the best shopping, and when we go to L.A. we are going to Rodeo Drive (best shopping in the world) and also we get to go to my staple clothing store: Abercrombie and Fitch. Check it out, they have sweet clothes:   urlLink  www.abercrombie.com   . My other fave store in the US is Hollister. Its&nbsp; very California, but its owned by A&F--->   urlLink  www.hollisterco.com   &nbsp;But anyways while at the mall Joe and I looked outside and it suddenly was very dark and stormy out, so we booted it out of the mall. We really didn't want to be stuck in a storm like the one last Thursday. Man, the sky was scary on the way home, tons of lightning! As soon as we got home it got very windy and it began to pour rain. So Joe and I watched tv, we had a very good dinner made by my Mom (Mmmm snapper). Then we watched Pearl Harbor, as Joe has never seen it. its sooo long though so we didn't finish it. After Joe left I hung with my sister for a bit, then I went on&nbsp;MSN for a while, and suprise! suprise! I talked to Joe. I swear we have a problem.&nbsp;MSN is a disease. But my day with Joe was really fun, and I'm so happy we are all good again.    So... today I have track soon. I haven't been in a while, just training on my own, cause I'm the only one on the team that still has racing left. I can't wait till ASG is over though, then I get a nice long break thank goodness! It is much needed. Then I go to PS for 3 weeks which will be soo fun! I can't wait! Six Flags in L.A. will be amazing!!!&nbsp;Then school will start again. Wow its crazy how summer is flying by. It makes me sad. Cause then grade 12 begins, and before I know it, it will be over, and I'll have to say goodbye to so many amazing people. Not to mention this year is going to be stressful! DIPLOMAS! Ahhh! And of course I won't have Joe here to make everything ok again. Luckily I'm still surrounded by so many great people. My family, my best friend Cortney, and all my super friends at school who always keep me laughing.     Well, I have spilled out a lot of info here. I think its time I go do something productive. Ciao for now! :)     &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Hahaha, what a fun night! My best friend Corky came over with her boyfriend Robert, and then my sister had her friends Taylor and Braeden over as well as her friend Justine!&nbsp;I never really hang with my sisters friends but they are so halarious we all had a blast together! HAHAHA, the McDonalds bibs in the movie store! LOL! Oh ya and cruisin in the Mercedes..."Oh we will take the girls home first and come back for the guys." And then Kirsten couldn't get the key in the door! And Lyndsey coming over and ringing the doorbell but we didn't hear it in the basement so she went home! Oh man felt so bad, but it was soo funny! The Butterfly Effect was just creepy and disturbing, but at the same time was really good. But anyways so we swam all afternoon, went to McDonalds for dinner, and we made the guys walk there while the gals all cruised in the Mercedes, oh ya! And Mcdonalds was just fun! Throwing fries, stealing fries...haha good times! Then dropping Kirst and Justine at home, going back to get Rob, Tay, and Braeden and going to the movie store! LOL, the crazy gay guys in the video store were just funny! I can't believe they were grabbing eachothers asses! Oh my, it was not cool. When we got back watching the Butterfly Effect was just funny! LOL...unplugging the computer on Taylor! "I'm too scared to watch this movie!" And then everyone on the couch together! LOL, Corky: "I never thought I could be this uncomfortable." HAHA! Aww and Kirst and Tay are so cute! Why don't they just go out again!? Corky and I agree they are PERFECT for one another! But anyways this night was soo amazingly fun! I had an awesome time! I haven't laughed so much in a while! LOL! Good times, good times! Well I'm off! :)

      Yesterday was an AMAZING day! Joe and I went to the ZOO together! It was so much fun! I love the zoo and I haven't been there in so long so it was awesome to go. I was really impressed by the new Destination Africa exhibits they have built there. It was really cool to go with Joe to that as well, seeing he is from Africa, he knows everything about the animals. It is so cute to listen to him talk about all the things that he knows, because he gets this look on his face and seems so excited and happy. Which just makes me happy knowing he is so thrilled with something. So we stayed at the zoo quite a while and checked out other stuff too. We even *SHOCK!* learned some stuff. For instance did you know that a banana is not a tree, it is really this giant herb? We thought that was pretty darn cool. So we looked through&nbsp; the conservatory with all the plants, and then we went in the butterfly room, which I have to say was my favorite part of our zoo experience;) But it was sooo hot in that room. I mean it was like 30 degrees outside, inside this room it was probably 40! Joe and I also checked out the prehistoric park, which is looking a bit old and rundown, I hope they plan to restore it, cause it is a pretty good idea. We also walked through the Canadian Wilds and saw some sweet owls, wolves, bears, cougars. But we didn't get to see the otters, cause their exhibit was closed. Of course we went and saw the elephants, oh and we went and saw the new Creatures of the Night exhibit which was very dark, but the animals were pretty cool. Except the stick bug thing was just gross. We also saw all the different monkeys! Most of them are so funny and cute! The zoo was incredibly hot though, we certainly picked a nice day to go, but holy crap I was roasting! But in all the zoo was so much fun, as is everything I do in Joe's company!  After the zoo we went for dinner at Joey Tomato's...YUM! WE had some very tasty food, but I would have to say that our dessert, the molten chocolate lava cake, was the best! Seriously this dessert is so good its orgasmic! It is chocolate cake with hot melted chocolate in the centre. It is soooo good! So then after dinner we went back to my house to watch Orange County. I must admit I was reluctant to see this movie, but it was actually really funny. I liked it a lot.  Anyways this day was soo fun! And Joe, and thanks for taking me to the zoo! I love you tons!

      What an afternoon. First of all, its so bloody hot, but I can't go swimming cause my sister and her friends are monopolizing the pool...again! Then I decided to start reading this new book I got at the library called: "Someone Like You." But I began reading it, and its so horribly depressing. In the first chapter this girls boyfriend dies in a motorcycle accident! So anyways that just sent me into a depressing mood. I find that random things affect me, and put me into a serious mood. I don't know why. Like sometimes when I hear certain songs they put me into this intense mood where I start thinking about everything in my life. The good, the bad, but mostly I just begin to question myself. Like, seriously Berrit what the hell are you doing with your life? Are you living it as you should be? Are you living every moment like its your last? I have such a huge problem with that. Living in the moment. Even when something incredibly good is happening to me, I question whether I deserve it. Do I deserve this feeling I'm having? In any moment I experience I can't help thinking whats going to happen to fuck it up in the days to come. Almost like I can have a taste of anything I want, but I can never truly be satisified. The one and only person I actually feel incredibly satisfied with is Joe. Every moment I spend with him feels right. But even so I wonder if I deserve  an amazing person such as himself. is something going to ruin the perfect things we have going? I pray to God every night that he will always be with me, and that I won't screw this is up. I actually don't know what I'd do without him. But anyways don't get me wrong here. I love my life. My friends. My family. I like who I am. But I never feel like I'm totally giving life my all. My 110%. Could I be doing more? I never really know. I don't know what the future holds for me. Could I be doing more right now to secure it? Secure the life I want. What do I want? I'll tell you. I want the perfect family life. Well first I want to go to University, travel, gain a career. Then I want the husband, big wedding, wonderful house, kids, a dog...it sounds so stupid right now. But what I want most of all is LOVE. I want to be so deliciously in love, and be loved for all my life. But I wonder many times a day if I can really ever have that forever. I know right now in my life I'm in love. And I know the person I'm with loves me. But there is always lifes complications that get in the way. For instance his trip. Even when he leaves I know I won't be able to stop loving him. Not being able to feel his arms around me for so long is going to be tough. I can actually feel my heart breaking right now. This is what I mean, I have Joe right now, he's still here and everything, but I can never get it out of the back of my mind that he's going to be gone soon. But then there are the times when I tell myself to shutup and feel lucky. I mean if Joe and I are meant to be won't we have all this when he returns? I hope so. Oh God I hope so. I know I won't be able to be with anyone else. I guess all I can do is wait. Wait to see what life is going to throw my way. Wait and see if this incredible part of my life can be rekindled when he returns. All I know is I will be hoping and praying that I won't lose him. He means so much to me. He is the first person I've felt this way for. Is it wrong to feel so real about something, when you are so young. I don't think so, and even if I could I can't stop this feeling.

      Last night Mackenzie and I had a divine time watching numerous movies till 2 am. She is house sitting for her neighbors so we slept over there and had the house and tv all to ourselves. Well, first we walked to blockbuster to pick up movies and then went to co-op to get our ever important junk food...chips, candy, pop, etc. YUM YUM! But that is it, that is it I tell you. No more junk food pour moi, parce que Alberta Summer Games. But anyways, so we ate pizza, and all of our crap while watching cinematic masterpieces such as MONA LISA SMILE, TUCK EVERLASTING, and HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. They were all really good! Come on chick flicks are the best! Tuck Everlasting was soo cute, and very sad, I had to hold back the tears. And How to Lose a Guy in 10 days was just the best! SOOOOOOOOOO adorable. Kate and Matthew are the best couple on screen, besides Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling from the Notebook. Anyways the night was tres grand! I love it, Mackenzie makes me laugh so much, we were in hysterics all night. I don't like people who don't make me laugh. If you can't make Berrit laugh, I'm sorry there is nothing left for us. No I'm just kidding, but honestly, laughing is just so fun to do with someone. I am constantly laughing. Not only do I laugh when something is funny, but when I'm nervous I tend to laugh also. I always laugh when I am incredibly happy. Whenever something happens to me that makes me happy I laugh. Yes, Joe, this is why, when you kiss me, I laugh:)  Anyways I'm very bored right now. I just went running and it is HOT!!! People at the Stampede in their jeans must be roasting! I have nothing to do all afternoon. Everyone I know is either out, working, or at the Stampede. Berrit is all alone!!! Oh well, I have to go to a meeting at 5 anyways! FOR THE ALBERTA SUMMER GAMES! I am so excited that I am on the team! Tonight we get our uniforms, track suits, bags, and all that kind of stuff. I can't wait! I'm kind of nervous for the ASG though! Joe and his family are coming to watch! I'm soo thrilled they are coming, but I'm nervous too! I better run well! I don't want them to be dissapointed.  Well I should probably go finish my training and quit slacking and blogging instead. Ciao for now!

      You can't do ANYTHING in this city without getting rained on. Today I was at track practice, and as I was doing my drills in the field, these huge big black clouds were like looming over me. Then this weird slushy hail started, but it went away after a few minutes. But then the lightning and thunder started. My Mom came out of the car and was like: "Berrit I don't think you should be out in this." I was like: "Meh. I need to finish my workout." Hahaha I decided I would risk it. The lightning was really close though, it was kinda scary, but what are the odds really of being hit? It would have been kind of funny if I was hit though...well not really, but just think of the headlines. "GIRL HIT BY LIGHTNING AT TRACK, SAID SHE NEEDED TO FINISH HER WORKOUT." LOL! And then my Mom would comment: "She just wanted to run, thats all, why? WHY???!!" Oh man. Actually I really shouldn't joke about that. But its kinda weird how I often think of what would happen if I died. I know its silly and stupid but I can't help it. How many people would come to my funeral I wonder? But anyways, on to a happier topic... Today was my Grandma's birthday! She is 74! My Grandma and Grandad are too cool. They have been married for over 50 years, and they are so cute. My Grandad gave her this pretty sweater for a gift, and she was like: "Bless you Bill, bless you! I know you noticed when I looked at this in the store." And then she kissed him, and it was so cute. They are so obviously still in love after like 50 years! In a world full of divorce who can actually say they've been married 50 years! I just kept thinking how when I get married I want what my grandparents have. Someone I know who will always support me and be there for me. Someone to grow old with. Yesterday Corky and I drove by this house in Mckenzie Towne with a huge porch and two rocking chairs on it. I was like: "Awww when I'm old I want to sit on a porch just like that with my husband!" I think that would be the coolest thing ever. I don't care if I accomplish great things in this world. All I know is when I'm 80 I want to be able to sit back in my rocking chair and say: "Damn I am so happy, I have had such a wonderful life." And it doesn't matter if world peace was attained or I have lots of money. I just want to be happy. And have my family around me. And I want them to be happy. I want to be a successful person of course, but if I have gone through life as a happy person, then thats all the accomplishment I need.

      Ok, yesterday was soooooooooooo fun! I hung out with corky, and she had this AMAZING suprise for me. She told me she was getting a landrover, but then when I came out to see it, it was really a MERCEDES! Oh my gosh it is such a sweet car. We had so much fun cruisin in it, damn we looked hot! HAHA! So we went to lunch for Moxies and had very tasty bruschetta! Then we went driving again, and we ended up in McKenzie Towne again. We love driving through there and looking at all the houses, it is so fun. Were like "Oh I'm going to live in a house just like that when I get married." The houses are so cute and nice there, with big porches and backyards and beautiful gardens. Man, I want to live in a house just like that when I'm older. It's weird, like I know I'm only 16, but real life seems so much closer now than in used to. I mean one more year of school, then university! Its kind of scary, but exciting too! So after we drove around Mckenzie and got slurpies, we went back to my house, and soon my grandparents and Joe came over. I was excited to see my grandparents, but I can't lie when I said I was soo happy to see Joe too! Even though I had just seen him, I honestly can't get enough of him, he just makes me soo happy! We all had a fun evening together. We mostly hung out anf talked, had a really good dinner, and then rented a movie. We got FEAR DOT COM. Hahaha, there was one scary part where I like screamed, mostly cause Joe scared me at the same time! LOL. I was so scared though! It was so fun just to sit there in his arms, I love it. In all, the evening was a blast. I'm so happy Corky and Joe got to meet too. What a good night!

      Wow. Amazing day yesterday. I got home from Legion Camp, which was just sweet, and then I got to see Joe, which was so wonderful. I can't believe how much I missed him. A week felt like forever, I can't really imagine what 36 weeks is going to feel like. But so far being with him these past 3 and some months has just been incredible. Words can't even describe how happy he makes me. And the best part is that I know he feels the same way, and that is honestly the best feeling in the whole world. And although, yes, I do get extremely sad when I think about being apart from him for 9 months, I can't help thinking that if this is meant to be then things will work out for us when he gets back. I think about that moment a lot. The moment when he gets home, I'm waiting for him at the airport and the second I see him I know. I know that this is the most real thing I've ever felt. And I just run into his arms, and I know everything is going to be ok again, cause he's home. Now I don't know if that sounds crazy or not, cause 9 months is such a long time, but I don't think I can give up what we have. And if its meant to be, it will be when he comes home. Every time we are together, everything feels right, and I know I could never ask for more than what we have. Its that special.

      I am FINALLY home from Legion Camp (which is a track camp sponsored by the legion, if you don't know). Meaning that yes, our chaperones are all like 80 and like to knit, and also that the food is like the food you get at a Legion function, meaning that yes, it tastes like crap. Anyways, the camp wasn't too bad. To give you a taste of how a day at track camp would be like, I'll explain. Ok, so you get up everyday at 6:30am. You go for a half hour run followed by drills and stretching. Then you go to breakfast. After that you have a training session from 9-11am. Then you go back to your dorm, eat lunch, and then you have another session from 2-4pm. After that you go back to your dorm, collapse on the bed for a bit, go to dinner, and soon after go back for your last session of the day from 7-9pm. By that time you are dead and craving sleep. But here's the thing. The UofC dorms you stay in have the worst beds ever!!! Seriously, I swear they are just springs and like a piece of cardboard on top. Soooo bad and uncomfy, and squeaky...ughh! Lets not even get me started on the food at this place. It was utter crap. Last year at camp you could go to the dining hall and buy w/e you wanted with a meal card. This year it was all planned out by the legion/old people as a buffet. Lets just say we definitely got served the meals of champions. NOT. Ummm..ok... bacon, sausage, and hashbrowns in the morning! What the hell, you can't run on that! Luckily they had toast. Then for lunch we had some kind of sick pasta everyday, and dinner was always something gross like sheperds pie, or year old lasagna. And SALAD! I love salad, but we had it with EVERY meal, EVERY meal! And the same italian dressing. On the last night I couldn't even put the salad into my mouth, I was soo sick of it.  so..then on top of all the training we had to do, we also had to race. I'm not going to get into all my races and go into detail about my splits and laps and blah blah. If you're not a runner, you won't care. Lets just say my 1500m was crap, my 3000m was ok and I got third, and my 4x400m was fun and I got third. Well I won my lap, but my team got third. We so would have won with just me and Joelle running, but we got stuck with these two girls who were sooo bad. And the one girl pissed me off so much, but I'm not going to go on, I'll just get angry. But ya, Diane and I had fun at the camp. We were roomates! We had this big inside joke about how this camp was really FAT CAMP. And it totally was like that fat camp in the movie Heavyweights. You just run all day, everyday. And you get like no food. And you are always exhausted. Diane and I went and got cookies from Subway and smoothies after our racing was done. Mmmm it was so good. We are fat kids at heart...haha...just jokes. But anyways, Legion Camp was very exhausting (ok try walking back and forth to the track from the dorms 6 times a day, and carrying a heavy bag), then having to run, and train, and then race. Then after that eating food you can barely force down, and sleeping on a rock hard bed. Does that sound like fun to you? Maybe not. But really, I can't lie. Even though I complain sooo much, I really do love to run. And this camp is actually fun. You meet amazing people from all over Alberta, you get sweet coaches who actually teach you a lot, and even the old legion people are pretty nice. So in all Legion Camp isn't that bad. You have to look past all the crap and realize you are there for one reason: You love to run. And if loving to run and being your best means you have to go through this week of hell, then its totally worth it. Every single minute is worth it.

      Wow! I'm writing here more than once today, je suis tres, tres pathetique. I am sitting here, watching Seinfeld, which is actually the stupidest show ever created, and I swear it was made just for people who sit around randomly and have nothing better to do, so they watch it. Considering over half the people in America are like that (hmmm...i wonder why everyone is obese), no wonder Seinfeld ran for like 10 years and had amazing ratings! Go figure!  Anyways... i went for my run, it was actually really good, but damn its hot out, like all humid, I think its going to rain. Then I came home and ate a very tasty cinnamon bun! I love them, and I haven't had one for sooo long. Then I yelled at my sister for a bit, watched Much Music Combat Zone. The first song was Hilary and Haylie Duff's "Our lips are sealed." Eww. Not voting for that, what a bad song. The other song was Evanescence's "Everybody's Fool." Which is a pretty good song actually, so my vote is with that one. Today on the radio I heard Maroon 5's "This Love." omg that song seems so old now, and it got totally over played. But I can't lie, I liked it a lot when it came out. I must also reveal again how sad I am when I say I actually really like Avril Lavigne's new music. I know some people will kill me for saying this, but I like it! OK! I'm sorry!  So...I really have nothing left to say, but I'm hungry, so food here I come. Ciao!

      So, today has been extremely boring so far! No one good is on MSN right now, and I should be out for a run, but sadly I am sitting here blogging, when I should be out training for the Alberta Summer Games! I have come to realize the computer is a very addicting machine. Not only has MSN become a disease, but now I can sit here and type random things, which is very fun, and now I know I will never be able to leave this stupid machine.  Last night I went and saw the BEST movie, THE NOTEBOOK! It was so good! And it totally was not your avergae sappy romance story, it was totally believable! The actors were perfect with one another and they seemed sooo in love, it was adorable. I loved the movie from beginning to end, and yes it did make me cry. Its almost up there with Pearl Harbor in being sad, but a kind of romantic happy sad that just makes your heart ache. But to go on...aww the movie! It was just so well done, and the characters were great, I loved it, go see it!!! Anyways...today I have company over, which really sucks! I hate having company over, unless you love the people and have a blast with them. My situation, not so much. Its my Dads good friend from Kelowna and his two kids. Needless to say we see them probably once every 3 years, so we don't even know oneanother, making this situation very awkward. I hate the: "Ya, so hows it goin?" "Ummm...good thanks, you?" "Pretty good." And thats it. Thats all you have to say. Usually at this point I suggest we rent a movie, which is a good time waster in which you do not have to converse with oneanother.  Thank goodness I am going to Joe's tonight! My mom almost made me miss that to go out to dinner with the company, which would be the worst. You cannot escape conversing with guests at a restaurant, thats all there is to do there, except maybe the time spent ordering, going to the bathroom, etc. which in all probably takes up 10 min. of the two hour dinner.  Well, I should probably get out and go for my run now, man this is going to be my first long run in like 2 months because I have been racing so much and have to take fridays off usually. Blah...I hate long runs, the sacrifices you must make to be a track star..haha..just kidding! Anyways, I want to get it over with so I can look forward to my evening with Joe. Screw the company, I am so happy I don't have to go to that dinner! Anyways, I'm off!

      What could be greater than 3 weeks spent in Palm Springs California? I'll tell you...3 weeks in San Fran, but I did that last summer, so Palmy Springys it is. I can't believe I'm leaving on tuesday! Ahhh California... land of sun, beaches, nice cars, surfer boys, and abercrombie and fitch. Its like some kind of heaven I tell you. ;) But ya I'm really excited, but sad too, that when its over, summer is over too, but what can you do? This summer was amazing!!! I only hope I won't think back one day to this summer and wonder what could have been. I definitely want to do everything I can to make this summer the beginning of something, something I can look back upon and remember this is where it all began. But anyways soon fall will begin, along with my grade 12 year. I'm so excited and curious as to what lies ahead for me...but whoa, thats thinking a bit too far ahead...so back to California...  We’ve been on the run Driving in the sun Looking out for number one California here we come Right back where we started from Hustlers grab your guns Your shadow weighs a ton Driving down the 101 California here we come Right back where we started from California (California...) here we come On the stereo Listen as we go Nothings gonna stop me now California here we come Right back where we started from Pedal to the floor Thinking of the roar Gotta get us to the show California here we come Right back where we started from California (California...) here we come  Hahaha, the OC anyone? I guess Palm Springs is a bit like The OC. But no ocean, and a lot more old people...

       Breakfast at Tiffany's. This is a good song. I always listen to it in Corky's car, along with BEP's "Let's Get Retarded" and Jimmy Eat World's "In the Middle". This song doesn't really apply to my life, a few things in it do, but not the part about everything being over and such. I just really like the song, if you download it, you will see, it has a good tune. Here are the lyrics:      Breakfast at Tiffany's   by Deep Blue Something      You say that we've got nothing in common   No common ground to start from   And we're falling apart   You'll say the world has come between us   Our lives have come between us   But I know you just dont care    And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"   She said, "I think I remember the film,   And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."   And I said, "Well, thats the one thing we've got."    I see you - the only one who knew me,   And now your eyes see through me   I guess I was wrong   So what now? It's plain to see we're over,   And I hate when things are over -   When so much is left undone.      And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"   She said, "I think I remember the film,   And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."   And I said, "Well, thats the one thing we've got."      And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"   She said, "I think I remember the film,   And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."   And I said, "Well, thats the one thing we've got."

      So now I officially have a habit of posting song lyrics I like on my blogger. Maybe you'll like this one too, you never know...   Fields Of Gold by Sting  You'll remember me when the west wind moves Upon the fields of barley You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky As we walk in the fields of gold  So she took her love For to gaze awhile Upon the fields of barley In his arms she fell as her hair came down Among the fields of gold Will you stay with me, will you be my love Among the fields of barley We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky As we lie in the fields of gold  See the west wind move like a lover so Upon the fields of barley Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth Among the fields of gold  I never made promises lightly And there have been some that I've broken But I swear in the days still left We'll walk in the fields of gold We'll walk in the fields of gold  Many years have passed since those summer days Among the fields of barley See the children run as the sun goes down Among the fields of gold  You'll remember me when the west wind moves Upon the fields of barley You can tell the sun in his jealous sky When we walked in the fields of gold When we walked in the fields of gold When we walked in the fields of gold   Enjoy:) -Berrit

      The first night watching it was really fun, no doubt about that. But I would not recommend seeing it a second time in such a short time period. I was so bored tonight I had to watch this movie with my sister again. Considering it was quite predictable the first time, the second time was like "oh my god, I wonder whats going to happen?" Wink wink, nudge, nudge. It is definitely a cute movie though. Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo are very good together on screen. Its a total heart warmer. Not as good as Love Actually though. 13 going on 30 had a good message for girls everywhere though. "Being a six-chick is not the be all and end all of your teenage experience." It's true. Personally from experience, it is WAY better not to be part of the cool crowd, because most of them end up as taxi drivers, like the guy Chris in the movie, later on in life. Let me simplify this for you. The cool people are losers. Cause they think they are so cool, and they ARE NOT. OK?!!!!!!!! Ok, good. But anyways I must go, good people are on msn now. Yes, this is exactly how cool I am. Bye:)
