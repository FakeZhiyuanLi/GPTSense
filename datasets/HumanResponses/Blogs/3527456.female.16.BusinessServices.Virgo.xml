						   Ehh not much goin on today except we're having debates on matts party. Glenn wants his girl to go but we're all pretty much decided against it cause he'd spend ALL his time w/ her and none w/ ne of us cause she "feels left out around us" kay, w/e. I understand it a bit cause we're all really close nit, especially matt and i, we show it in our body language towards one another, we're always standing together and walking side by side usualy w/ our arms touching, we're just really close friends is all and its hard for another person to just join in w/ us and not feel left out cause we have sooo many inside jokes that we're always saying and wow this is a run on sentance....Okay so yeah, its better if she doesnt come. But if she doesnt i KNOW he'll be upset and say something to me about how matts a dick and we don't want that. Natt hasb't had a normal party since he moved here! Someones always gettin hurt mentaly or physically..*sigh* I hope it all goes well..i'm considering doing a blessing for the day to keep everything light and happy, that'd be a good idea. Lianna came on our bus today and was seriously annoying me, sometimes i just wanna punch her in the face. I really really do. I'm so damn bored right now and i just want it to be tomorow already so i can atleast go to work and fuckin do something...i feel like such a loser. I wish i could drive.. Dee and i had a nice little talk 2day about our virginity. We both feel like its a burden over our heads now and agree that we want to lose it. I;m surprised at her for feeling the same cause thats not a dee thing, but i'm glad she is cause now i can talk to her about it and vice versa. See i'm not saying i should go off and lose it to some bum on the street okay, its gotta mean SOMETHING. I'd only consider doing it w/ 2 ppl and thats cause i trust them pretty much w/ my life let alone my feelings, but the thing is its less likely to happen w. them. Guess i'll see where things end up.   Events of the Day  Matt hitting himself in the eye with a spoon Me shoving lianna on the ground during football Dee and i getting attacked by green buggies..eww My, Hello, I Love You shirt..hehe, my new fave Zoning out/fantasising in history EVERYONE failing our latest math quiz Ha, me cheating on a practice chem regents..so gonna fail DAN PAPALIAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even, if i get off the bus, they'll kill me...i'm going 2 ur house! Why r u going to his house? (matt and lianna at the same time) To have sex..(uh eww btw) LOTR 3 BABY My brother's bald!!!!! Your pants r 2 too big! But your still dirty Your shirts too short! Yeah, but its not dirty, and you are..Plus, it STILL looks good on me Horizontal stripes...prison garb much?

						   I have no more room in my other Journal so I'm starting this one! Tori got hurt today! AHHHHHHHHH There is no happiness there. Poor thing was hysterical crying. She dove for the football and fell square on her shoulder. Broke her collar bone...Ouch much. Not to mention, its her right side, so she can hardly move her arm. How's she gonna write for her SAT's? Or, well do anything else that involves moving much at all??? *considers(more then considers)doing healing charm for her! She needs it!) Lei is gonna give me a ring later cause her and I NEED to go shopping for Matts gift. Okay speaking of which, he's bein a bit annoying with this whole gift giving shit. He's real high matinence and won't accept a gift card under 40 bucks from Tori cause he "needs more then 20" What kinda shit is that? I'd be happy for that from a friend of mine who happens to NOT  be as well off as he and I are. I'm probly the one in the group w/ the most money and I have more fun with the wrapping paper then I do with the gifts. I'm easy to buy for..ne thing pretty or if all else fails, I'm always and I mean ALWAYS in need of candles. Yeah...Need those..Very useful and get expensive. But he's making a mountain outta a mole hill and kinda being annoying. I'm gonna have ALOT of fun though, we all are and I swear no one will ruin it, not even the weather if I have something to do with it and I do. I'll allow him to be annoying about it, its better if I let it pass then I can be annoying about my 17th birthday party where hopefully he wont have sex on my floor like he did on my sweet 16 night...hmmmm...  Events of Day:  HOT COCOA AND BAGELS! We're the only morons who drink that in 80 degree weather..hehe -(tori hitting me on the ear while i had head phones on) HA! I thought u had something on! -Tori stealing me 3 cookies from the lunch ladies -Liana falling on her ass out side cause I pushed her during monkey in the middle -Tori breaking her collar bone...ehhh -Matt and I spending all of period 9 together and changing the pass time to 1:45 instead of 1:15(got away with it to hee) -The thunder and rain we watched -Matt chewing on his pass and us saying simultaneously(no joke, no planning) Worst Episode Ever like the comic guy in The Simpson -EWWWWWWWWW in*synch is playing on my radio! TURN   IT     OFF    NOW!!! -safe falling in the bush and freaking out over the little green buggies on her. GET EM OFF ME GET EM OFF! EW EW EW GET THEM OFF! ehhmm. I think that's it.....Yap, that's all  Lesson of the Day: Monkey in the Middle is a very dangerous game.
