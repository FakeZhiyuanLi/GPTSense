      Ok...Why do people send there mail back to companies, remove there address from the letter, then write "Please take me off your mailing list!"  How the Fuck do they expect us to do that? Call up Psychic Friends Network and get their address? I think they are on crack.  And, also, the amount of time some people take to take out there address...(ie. taking a knife and neatly cutting it out) Some of the things are funny though...One person sent beer coasters and coupons in their return envelope, but no address!!  LMFAO   Or Better yet, the one that has been died since 1989, wrote back saying they were working full-time in Heaven, and that they would see me there!! LOL So Let this be a lesson to everyone...If you are getting pissed off with all the junk mail you are receiving, just send it back saying "please remove from mailing list", but please make sure your address is on there, because they won't be able to do anything with it if it's not there.  Bye for now, kiddies!

      I seem to be a bit confused....But I don't think it should be this fuckin' cold in Spring? It is like Mother Nature is on crack!!!! She doesn't know what to do with herself. I am bloody sick of the cold!! So tempted to move to a warmer climate.

      I was thinking...ok...So I am always thinking.... When someone yawns, they can make another person yawn...Right? So Maybe that yawn can be passed around the world, and eventually come full circle, making you yawn a day later!!! Crazy, eh? It is kind of like the butterfly effect! Or maybe not...  The Rover...  My Mom was looking on the net at pics of mars, taken by the rover...She said that they looked like they were take right here on earth...My theory is that they might have been. How do we know if they are really up there? Like the moon landing...People say that it was all fake, and totally impossible to travel to the moon....Conspiracy theories boggle my mind. Tell me what you think, or tell me that I have losted my fuckin' marbles!  Reach me at thoughtsofacanadian@hotmail.com

      Yeah, so on this past Victoria Day Monday I was not having a good day....I woke up (on my friends couch) bent my leg to cross it, and all I heard was...RIPPPP!!!  LOL I then went into a hysterical laughing fit....My friend Tasha was wondering what the hell was going on, but I couldn't get it out, I was laughing so much....All she heard was...."Ripped....Pants....No....Underwear!!" Yes, Boys and girls I had a big rip down the crack of me arse, and no underwear on. So I had to rap myself in a blanket, and go to the bathroom. Oh, this is not the first time I was in a state where I should have been wearing underwear.....  A few years back I was going down a hill leading to a basketball court, wanting to play some B-ball and take a break from studying for my final exams. Needless to say, I slipped on the hill, basket ball went flying in the air, and broke my ankle.....I was in so much pain...Bugs were eating me alive.....My friends Tasha and Mike were trying to keep the bugs away, when Tasha asked me..."Do you have clean underwear on?" (My mother and I supposed all mothers would ask this of their children when they leave the house, just in case they got into an accident) I laughed my ass off the too....I told her, "I'm not wearing any underwear!" That made me feel a bit better....At least they didn't have to rip my pants off or anything like that. I was lucky that I was wearing my "Jeannie in a bottle" pants with elastics around the bottom.  Getting back to last Monday....Yes there is more....  I was sitting at the supper table, eating chilly. Playing with my food as always, when Mike G said something that made me laugh, and the beans that I had in my mouth went flying onto the floor....So as I was picking them up I was tell my sister Julie about my PJ pants incident earlier that morning, and as I was bent over even more, to pick up the bean on the floor, we could hear this crackling noise coming from my direction....Well, it took me too long to process where the sound was coming from, until my ass hit the floor! Yes the chair broke! Then everyone was laughing.....And me...I woke up the next morning with a brused ass, and elbow...and a sore stomach from laughng too hard the day before....  Like I have said, many a time, I am here on this earth for comic relief!

      Just when you can't sleep at night, and decide to turn on the tube to get your mind off the things that are keeping you awake, and the only thing on are toughs bloody info-commercials! They piss me off, but it is funny...You end up watching them...It is like they are sending some sort of transmission, a subliminal message, that keeps you from turning the shit off.  I think that the weather network has a trance inducing feel to it....My Sister can watch that channel for hours...I think it is insane, but who am I to judge insanity? But I know it when I see it, because I see it every time I look in the mirror!  He He He

      We finally had a nice day...I was getting depressed with all the bloody fog we been having, and then the light shown though...giving me hope once again. LOL  The Fog in this city may be the one reason I move the hell out of here and go somewhere it is nice.  LOL Like that will happen...I can't see myself leaving...I wish I could, sometimes, but I am stuck here....See I am under house arrest...No, not really....LMFAO

      Went to see Troy tonight with a few friends...It was very good, a lot of action, and it had Brad Pitt in it...Need I say more? lol It was three hours long, though...But I didn't make the mistake of buying a huge drink, as I did for the last Lord of the Rings. I thought I was going to piss my self during that one,and I didn't want to leave in case I missed something important....I do try to follow some of the lessons I learn in the past, even the little ones...

      On the weekend, friends and I went to the local nature park (Irving Nature Park, for those of you familiar with Saint John, NB) We were walking on the trails and all of the sudden one squirrel came right close to us. We were all like, "Awww...Look at the squirrel, isn't it cute, and very tame!" So that was fine, we kept on walking, but it followed us...Then there were two, then three, then four...."It is like they were stalking us", said one of us. Then I envisioned a big mob of squirrels attacking us, blood gushing everywhere, eyes being gouged out....( I know...I have a morbid imagination....Maybe a little crazy...LOL) And I saw the heading on the front page of the paper...."4 Stalked and Eaten to Death By Killer Squirrels"  Sick, eh? Crazy? Yes

      I was looking at my old HS year book the other night...And Oh My God! What a bunch of crack pots we all were...LOL No not really...It is hard to believe that it will be ten years next year since I have been there. I feel old!!  It will be astonishing to see if there is an actual reunion...Not that I would go or anything...See I have had the same friend since graduation. Sure I have lost the friends that have needed losing, and found others on the way, and lost most of them too. (when I say lost, I don't mean that they died, I mean that they were a bunch of assholes, or we just lost touch) So there wouldn't be any reason for me to go...It would be too much work anyway, ie. I would have to lose weight, find a man, get married, have four kids, move into a mansion, drive a viper, and get a really posh job in Hollywood or somewhere that.   I have always told myself that anything is possible if you put your mind to it, but I would have to be on crack to actually make myself believe that I could do all this in a year! he he he The only thing that I could do was lose weight, and find a man, but who am I kidding!  Really, there is no one I could care less about seeing. Most of them were a bunch of assholes, harassing me and others everyday, thinking they are cool, making themselves feel better about something they lack in there lives (like maybe insignificant genitalia! LOL). Nothing but bullies! But I am not bitter or anything...Really, I am a better person then what they were, or in some cases, still are.   But, I still have a year to think about it...  Chances are, even if there isn't a reunion, I will have my own kitchen party (as we Maritimers like to have, eh?), get together all my friends, and just shoot the shit, and talk about old times, and new times to come...We will have to dig up the time capsule that we buried in my parent back yard the year we graduated, and see what we put in it, I can't remember what I put in it...it should be interesting. My friend Tim says he doesn't want to dig it up, which makes me want to dig it up right now! LMAO...What did he put in it? Why is he so keen on not digging it up? What did he say in his letter? Hopefully it won't cause a huge fight, eventually leaving nobody left talking to each other....That would be really shitty! To make it that far in years, still being such close friends, then end the friendship over something we wrote when we were 18 and on crack!   LOL Lets hope this doesn't happen...

      It is just around the corner, and it is one of my favourite holidays. One, because I feel that I was blessed to be put on this great country, and Two, because it is a day that I spend with my friends and family.  Not sure what I will be doing though...Hopefully the weather will be nice, as Saint John is known for it's fog and rain there is a good chance that it won't be nice, but I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed.

      I have now realize how much I swear on this thing...I have a very bad case of potty mouth, and I am so sorry if I offend anybody...Maybe that will be a New Years resolution for me for next year..."Get rid of Potty Mouth!" I know what you are thinking..."Lisa that is soooooo far away, why not start now?", and I say !@!# off  lol No, really, it will give me time to prepare for when hell freezes over!  LOL   Anyway, I will try to do my best not to swear too much.  Blessed Be,  Aurora (aka Lisa)

      Ok, what the hell is wrong with me?   I have hated politics all my life, sure I have voted since I was 18yrs old, but I could give a shit who won, let alone get involved in politics, and actually watched it for hours uppon hours!!! Why the sudden interest, now? je ne sais pas?  Oh, and Hockey...I was glued to the TV during play-off season...I have never been a "sports fanatic", I mean watching them on TV (I enjoy playing all types of sports, with exception for basketball. Haven't played that since I broke my ankle.) And just when they may not play next season 'cause of a strike, make me sad a bit inside. Ok, not really... I haven't got the slightest clue why I watch it...then I got thinking about it...like I need more thoughts running through this disorganized mind of mine...I think that maybe I starting watching it to have someting to relate to with my Father, something we have in common...or it could be something else...It could be just a phase I am going though.

      I think we are fucked!  lol No, not really...it is good, I think, that we have a minority government...  My vote was a "wasted" vote, but hey I voted...I am just glad it is over...(How many times have I said this?)  now it is time to talk about other things other than politics! Time to move on....(I hope)

      Well the day is here, thank fuck! And I voted! I am surprised as you are that I did go and vote....But I figure I should since it is my duty of a Canadian, and shit like that.   I went into the poll having no idea  who to vote for, and I left not knowing who I voted for!  LOL  I did e nee me nee miney mo, and it landed on a person I knew for sure I did not want to vote for, so I tried an other approach...Closing my eyes and pointing to a party on the list....My equilibrium must be off, cause I didn't even land on the paper...Third approach....Pick a number between 1 and 10...That was just a stupid idea, cause I knew what number to chose, so I just picked any party, and marked an X by it...But if there were a "None of the above." on the ballet I would have marked it there...  No, really I know who I voted for, and it was not the MJ party...I voted for le parti vert, or Patti vert...LOL (inside joke: Lisa aka Aurora had a blonde moment reading their election sign when they were first put up, thinking it was funny that Patti Vert was running for the Green Party. It was funny that her last name was green also...Then I clue in...Brain fart! My sis Julie laughed her ass off at me, and I laughed me ass off too...Blame it on the hair!)   I can't wait to find out who wins or to see if there is going to be a minority government...I can't wait till this is over!

      Well it is the eve of the federal election, and I still haven't got a bloody clue whom I am voting for! This is the shitiest election, ever! All the people that are running will inevitably fuck this country up even more so then it is now if they get in! So it is a lose/lose situation for everybody, I think.   The only thing I do know is who I am not voting for....So that leaves me with three parties: Green Party, The marijuana Party, and some independent guy I have heard of. The MJ party is Who I am going to vote for, I think. At least they will be happy all the time if they get in!  he he he   And to the people who say that I am wasting my vote if I vote for someone that will not get in, I say to them, it is one less vote those three parties get, one less $1.50 or what ever they get for each vote. (they get paid for each vote they get...shit I should run in an election, I will know that at least I will get one vote, that is enough to buy a coffee plus tip...LOL)    All I know is that I can't wait until this is over...I am sooo sick of the back stabbing, bull-shit commercials that are saturating the TV!  Lets how Canada isn't too fucked up by the outcome!

      Is it me, or do bees get bigger every year? I remember when I was young, they were as big as the tip of my pinky, but now they are as big as the tip of my thumb. Is this just happening here in Saint John? Is it all the pollution in the air, that is mutating them? Are they on the juice? Injecting a little bit of roids?  Needless to say I didn't like bees before when they were smaller, now that they are mutant bees I disdain them even more! Yes I have issues....

      I had a shit ass day today! Had an interview at a spa today, and did I ever fuck it up. I didn't have any answers to her questions, but I had tons of questions for her, which she was able to answer better then I. GRRRRRRRrrrr.... I have been on many interviews over the years, but when it comes to important ones that involve the field I am trained in, I fuck those ones up. Why? I ask myself...not quite sure, but if I had all the answer to life, there would not be anything to live for... It just pisses me off that I spent so much on school, work soooo hard to complete it, I went though the impossible to graduate, and I haven't receive any work. I think it is time to start something of my own, my own business. Couldn't be any worse then this. Could it?

      Yeah, so I was getting meat out of a friends freezer, and the cat was pawing at something in the window. I looked....Shit my self a little...Not really....And there was a big ass bee on the windowsill....The bee wasn't the size of George the cat, but it was still big.  See I have issue with bees, ever since I was swarmed by them when I was younger...But that is another story....  Back to this story.... So I screamed...Not a girlie scream, but a scream, and I swore a bit (like always) and asked Kim if she had a fly swatter so I could try and kill the bloody thing. She did not have a swatter, but she did rig up a trap to catch it...She is a part of the catch and release program. LOL She got a cup, and a piece of card board from a sunlight laundry detergent container, and tried to catch the thing. I was just glad it was out of my hands, she took the responsibility of catching it....I just stood there and watched ready to go running and crying like a bloody baby.  She finally caught it after three trys and released it out the back door. Then the bee probably found the closest person, and stung them, because it was really pissed off. Oh well, at least it was not me, or Kim! He HE He

      Yeah so I watched the debate..Well some of it...to help me choose which dick...I mean party to vote for....I still haven't got a bloody clue!  At times you couldn't even hear what anyone was saying because they were all conversing too loud. I spent most of the time looking at the bottom of the screen at that meter thingy, not hearing anything. I am considering voting for Martin, but that is only because I don't want Harper to get in. That guy scares the shit out of me. It is like he wants us to become the 51 state! Fuck that shit! I am proud to be a Canadian, I don't want to become something I don't recognize. Then I thought I might vote for the Bloc....This guy Duceppe would be an awesome guy to vote for.....but why vote for someone who wants to tear the country apart. Needless to say I am still in the dark on who I am going to vote for, if I vote at all. LOL

      I haven't got a bloody clue who I am voting for PM... They all talk the same bullshit! They all back stab each other. Are they really telling the truth, or are they just trying to con people into believe what they say about their opponents is true. One guy is ass deep in scandal, one want to be more like the USA, and one wants to dip into the CPP for restoration of old buildings, and the other two parties you never hear from!   I just might put a friends name down on the ballet...They would do a better job...maybe....lol  Anyway, I may vote, I may not, but may the best bullshitter win!!!

      There is nothing I don't like more then those bloody June bugs.....How the hell do they know when it is June...They live underground for so long, and it is like they have a calendar with them, they look at it and say, "Oh, it's June now, so let go out and bug the shit out of people, swarm in there faces and bounce off their door, as if knocking on them and asking them to come out!"  LOL  When I was younger, my friend Tasha and I would go for walks around the block with badmiton racquets in our hands, protecting ourselves from them....Now, I still go out with something in my hand. I even strained my neck one time swinging at one... It is sad I know...These poor little bugs, striving to survive by coming out once a year to procreate, and I go and kill them...Well I don't go around looking for them, if they come near my head that is when I attack.

      Things happen, you learn from them and move on...Well, most of us do.  All we do is live in fear, live to distrust,. We learn to cut ourselves off from life...This is what the world has come to.  We live in a world of fear. A world with no hope. It makes me ashamed to be here.  They Kill and call it freedom...They take over and expect trust...To point the finger, to place the blame...To get revenge, to kill and maim....An eye for and eye, all based on fear...If only your god can say who is in the right, things would be so clear.   **I wrote this when the USA began the war on Iraq.&nbsp; People were/are being arrested because of their names and race, not being charged with anything. People are living in fear, not saying they have no right to be, but it teaches the human race not to trust. A world with no trust, no&nbsp;faith in humanity&nbsp;is not a good place to be. I have always felt that hate is a very powerful word. I feel if you say you hate something or someone, you want it to die. SO if you say, "I hate carrots!", you therefore are saying,&nbsp; "I want my carrots to die!"  And as for the last line...There are so many wars that have broken out all on the bases of religious beliefs...I have never been in that situation, and I hope that I will never be...Not to damper or judge anyone's reasoning for why they believe they must kill in the name of religion...I just hope to live to the day when they realize that all religions are in the right...We are all human beings, living on this one planet together, either we like it or not. We can't build walls around us to segregate from people we don't like....We must learn acceptance of all races, religions, and sexual orientation. Move on to the future, instead of living in the past. If we don't progress into something more peaceful, we will eventually self destruct!   If I offend anyone by my views, I am truly sorry. These are my view, and are not by any means to be written down to influence others to believe. Be your own person. I just write it down, in frustration of the world we live in. Feeling that I haven't got any control of my surrounding, only control, for the most part, of the thought that swim around in my head.

       ...Of a bashful bowel!&nbsp; lol   Did you ever have a shit attack, went into a bathroom stall, and couldn't go cause there was too many people in the bathroom. Fearing they may hear you, or that they might die from the stench. You had the case of the peek-a-poo's...It get scared...  The fact is, everybody poops!&nbsp; lol But, yet we are so embarrassed to go in public...Well most people don't mind...I personally could care less, where I go...If I have to go I have to go, but this past weekend I had a case of a bashful bowel!  Went out of town, and on our way back to SJ, &nbsp;I had an attack...Rumble in the Bronx...(if you know what I am saying...he he he)...I went to four different bathrooms, all were filled with tourist...So I didn't go.... I decided I could try and hold it until we got home...But.... Scared that I might have to go in the woods, and have some bear bite me arse, or have a moose see me and figure that I was presenting to him, and he would then try to hump me, or the amount of bug bites I would get on my ass and have a itchy ass for a week, act like a dog and drag my ass on the carpet to scratch my ass...This was not going to happen! So after going back to the bathroom I went to the first time, and success!!...And you ask, "Why the Fuck is she talking about her BM?"

        yah, so I was talking to my friend Kim on MSN messenger the other night, when I heard choking, or gagging from underneath my feet. Have you ever heard a cat choking on a hair ball? Well, that is what it sounded like. It has been known to all that live here, that there has been cats living under our sunroom, and there has been skunks living under there for years. So I decided to look out side to see if the thing was alright.    I looked out, and peeked my head around the corner, and saw this poor little skunk sticking it's head out of a hole, choking...I then walked up to it and performed the Heimlich maneuver....No, not really... I may be blonde, but I am not stupid...The pure little thing stop eventually and went on its way down to the garden....    I would think they are so cute, if they didn't stink so much.    My Father has tried everything imaginable to get rid of them...(putting a light underneath the room all night, soap, ammonia, etc.) But they are still here, and most likely here to stay...I have gotten used to them, but it's shitty, because you get all paranoid when going outside at night, fearing a run-in with them...Get very jumpy when you hear the slightest noise...lol    Hey, if anybody knows of a way to get rid of them, please let me know.

       urlLink TheStar.com - U.S. same-sex marriage ban flops    What is your view on this?  I know what I think about this topic...I am interested on hearing your thoughts. And you are saying to yourself, why does it matter what I think, as a Canadian? It matters because everything the United States implements, effects the whole worlds views.

      I was totally shock and astonish by the ignorance of knowledge of a group of American tourist today... My friend Kim and I were in line at the cash at an uptown shop. There were Americans at the cash wanting to pay with American currency. This being Canada and using Canadian currency, they were told by the cashier that they would receive change back in Canadian money. The Lady making the purchase said, "Never mind..." The manager of the shop was also at the cash said, "You are going to Halifax tomorrow, aren't you?" She said, "We are leaving here shortly..." Then there was a pause...And she said, "Do they accept Canadian currency in Halifax?" I in turn said, "Oh My Fuck!", to my friend, under my breath. I felt like saying, "No, each province has it's own currency! Or did you think Nova Scotia is the 51th state!"  I am not pointing out that all Americans are like this, but I have come across a few that are totally dumb founded by our history, or anything about this country.

      Or any conscience?   I read an article this morning that made me literally sick to my stomach!   Some sick FUCK decided they didn't want to take care of there two month old kitten (or what ever BS reason they decided to do this inhuman act), so they placed it inside a garbage bag! And to make sure the poor thing would surely died, they double bagged it...Luckily, a man saw a moving garbage bag, and saved the poor soul from asphyxiation. This is not the first time this has happened in the port city...Another kitten was found a few months in a garbage bag, left to die...  My Question is...What the Fuck is wrong with people? Have they no heart? Animals have a right to live in this world, as we do! I am finding more and more, as time goes by, that some people don't give a shit about animals. They leave them out in the cold, they let them run loose, leave them tied up all day without water, or food, or love...I can go on and on...But they don't realize that if they can't take care of them, they have a place they can take these animals...The SPCA will take them in...Give them another chance with someone else, instead of killing them!   And to those who did this horrible act, or to others who mistreat there animals, remember, the bad karma police will be on your ass, and you will receive three times worse then what you did...This goes for anything in life...I believe...

      1. People that bring their dogs on a beach that has a sign clearly stating, "No Dogs On Beach"... "Surely, they can't mean our dog?", they say to them selves. Don't get me wrong, I love all animals, but I don't enjoy stepping in there shit with bare feet! (yes this has happened...Twice! lol )  2. June-bugs in July...(I know, I have a thing about the bugs...But it is unacceptable! he he he)  3. Rude people...Like the people you hold the door open for, and they go and slam the door in your face; people who judge you before they even know you; and so on, and so on...yada yada yada (wow, that is an old saying), anyway, you get the picture.  4. Reality TV....Yet I am compelled to watch it...Yes, it is the only thing on, but what ever happened to all the other things they used to play on TV?   5. This guy on Jeopardy...Not Alex, Alex rocks!...The guy that has been winning for the 25 day in a row, and still going strong...He is like an opened encyclopedia...I want to be that smart...I know, envy is not becoming...Even my niece is appalled, when she see him on there, "He's STILL on there!", she say to me. (Kids say the cutest things)  6. Ever-wipes (LMFAO)  7. People that write LMFAO...If it was possible to laugh ones ass off, don't you think I would have a smaller behind then what I have now? Shit, the amount of time I have used this abbreviation, I should have no ass left, whatsoever! LMAO/APAL (for all those who care...APAL is abbreviation I just made up: And Peed A Little) No, I am not on any drugs! The scary thing is that I don't even drink...If I were on drugs, or drank at least I would have an excuse for this insanity, but I don't...not anymore...(I was young and stupid!) Maybe it is the after effects? Holy...Did I ever go of the topic, eh?  8. Migraines, ice cream headaches, and the inability to go to sleep when I go to bed (insomnia)  9. The spider that is crawling on the floor as I type this...But I will let him/her be...They are my friends...They kill other bugs I don't like...Plus, if I kill it, it will rain...What the hell am I saying, it will rain whether or not I kill it...Bloody rainy city! There must be a lot of people killing spiders in this city, the amount of rain we get, but hey it is good for the garden, eh?  10. People that think I live in an igloo, drive around on a snowmobile, and no, Toronto is not just a couple of miles away, eh...And that I say EH all the time..Now you listen, by, I live in a house, eh? And I drive around in me automobile, eh? And I don't use "eh" in ever sentence...Eh? Ok, maybe I am getting a little carried away...EH!  He he he  11. Run-on sentences...like the one above...I am sure there is a lot of improper grammar throughout this blog...Some one call the grammar police!!  12. Grammar police  lol  13. AH...Lucky number 13...Being told that if I leave the plug in on the toaster, that it might catch something on fire, or opening the microwave with out hitting stop will give me a ZAP!....Oh, my, I could go on and on...But I won't, in fear that the person I am talking about may read this...Love you, Mum :)  I am sure there is more, but I seem to be cramping up...me phalanges are paining from typing...I may add to this list...and Hey! If you have anything you would like to add...feel free to add it in the comment thingy...  Bye for now, Me

      I love wearing sandals...If I could wear them all year round, I would be happier then a pig in shit, but...That would suck walking in 5-10 feet of snow in sandals. I wonder how many time I would go to the emergency room with frost bite on my toes? But it would be all good, 'cause I would be wearing my sandals, I would be happy... The only disadvantage of wearing sandals all the time is that you get stinky feet. No matter how clean your feet are, or even if you wear leather sandals, your feet somehow stink...Why?   My God, I am beginning to think that I am hitting the point of insanity...Why am I writing about sandal?   I've lost it!

      Did you ever have one of those days when you wanted to fall into the abyss, or a black hole never to be found or deal with anything for that moment in time? This is the type of day I had!

      Ok...I am getting old...I know 27 is not old, but I feel like I am 80...It is time to set my life in order...Time for change. Sure nobody likes change, but it is part of life, right? Time to move on and start my own life, instead of thinking other people need me here. I've come to realize today, I am not needed. I need this for my own sanity, or I am going to fuckin' lose it... I need to move away, I, I, I, Me, Me, Me! What a bunch of BS!

      Over the years I have asked the same question we all ask at least once in our lives, and some people have even asked me...What is the meaning of life? And I say, there is no meaning of life...It is what you make of it that counts, right? People search their whole lives for something that they can not find the answer to.  This is the way I see it...Life is about learning...  *Learning from your mistakes, sometimes learning from them more them once. (been there, done that!) *Learning how to love, and how to love again after your heart has been broken into fifty million pieces. *Learning how to be a good friend, sister/brother, aunt/uncle, daughter/son, mother/father, etc. *Learning how to trust, or how to trust again. (yourself, and others) *Learning that you can not run away from your problems. They always follow you wherever you are...So, you learn to deal with them, have some closure, so you can move on. *Learning that if life seems so fucked up, and it seems like you'll never make it another day, that there is always a way out of anything, we all have choices. There will be brighter days ahead, and that it will all work out in the end. *Learning not to be around negative people that put you down, and make you feel like shit.  I find we take for granted the things and people we have in our lives, waiting for the next best thing to happen, not realizing it was there already, right in front of our faces.  "We live in a material world, I don't materialize much. Sure money can set you for life, but without friends, or family I would lose my fucking mind!"  -me

      I am so bloody tired...and yet I am typing on here! lol   It was a good Canada Day. My Mother, niece Leah, and I went up town to soak in the activities of the day.   We had such wonderful weather. It was warm, but not too warm. The crowds up town where claustrophobic though. Met up with some friends along the way, and went to the NB museum (it was free today). That was cool..I always enjoy a little history lesson, and Leah seem to like it there also. Then we listen to the live entertainment. Nothing I love more then the beating of the bass from the speakers in my heart. We listened to a band called Crush, an Atlantic Canadian band. They have a few songs on the radio, they were pretty awesome. I like bands that sound exactly like there actual recorded single...None of that techno shit, or lipsync shit like some artist when they sing live, not mentioning any names of course. he he he   Met up with Julie and my father later on. As soon as it was time for the fireworks to begin, ironically the fog started rolling in. Surprise! NOT! And I was having a good hair day...That went all to hell!!! Nothing but friz! Temperamental hair sucks ass, but I am not a superficial, high maintenance type of gal.  So they fired two fireworks which just made the sky light up in green, but you couldn't see shit all, so they canceled them...Like that hasn't happened in Canada days past...(happened many a time)  So now the day is over, and it only took me two hours to write this...So bloody tired, and stupid for staying up!   So I say, Happy 137th B-day Canada! May God, Gods, Goddesses, Lords, and Ladies, Mother Earth,( which ever ones preference is) keep on blessing us and our beautiful country.
