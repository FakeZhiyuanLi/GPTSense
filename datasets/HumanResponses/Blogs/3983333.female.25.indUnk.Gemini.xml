      Redefinition of the term "world-change" The term world-changer is to often associated with Master's Commission. In reality it's not a program that qualifies anyone to truly change the world! God is who does the qualifying, it is just a matter of being open to the call. From the person who just got saved to the lifer, we're part of the elite, chosen by God - Ephesians 2:10. People always have had the misconception that they aren't good enough for God to use. God doesn't call the qualified - He qualifies the called! It's not about being good or holy; it's about being open to be used. Moses is the prime example. He was a murder, and tried to convince God he couldn't be a great leader. The stark truth is, on our own we are nothing, but when God works through us we are transformed, and become more than conquerors - Romans 8:37. When Biblical truths become the outpouring of our lives, walking in line with the Spirit and making ourselves available at every opportunity. That friends is when the term "world-changer" can ring true. I've seen people come through a program and fail, unless you are connected to Christ in every area of your life, that's true success.

      Obedience - to obey is to hear, listen  1 Samuel 15:22 - Obedience is better than sacrifice. To truly obey means when God asks something of us, we do it; no arguing or stalling. The only correct answer is "Yes, Lord." In our finite minds we try to weigh the pros and cons! We always question God, as if He wasn't correct on the situation(s). Are you sure God? How dumb humans are, even to the point of telling God yes, then putting it off for later. This is blatent disobedience. If God wanted us to do it later He would tell us later! Then, if ad when we finally do what we were asked, we make a huge deal about it. "Oh, the sacrifice to hear from God!" If that is our attitude we really are no better than the Pharicees! As God's people we are to listen to His voice and trust Him in ALL circumstances. When we truly obey (hear, listen) to God's voice, nothing is a sacrifice, it is a priviledge. Who are we as sinful man to even have God speak to us? There shouldn't be compromise when we say "Yes," it should mean just that. Not "Yes, but." If that is our attitude God won't honor it and we don't honor Him!

      I'm so sick of fighting this battle with Sarah. She needs to make up her mind once and for all if she wants to be a Christian. If she doesn't she just needs to leave small group altogether, instead of coming just for the social aspect. We are supposed to come and learn more about God and each other, but she has been so standoffish and quiet, it's like pulling teeth to get her to talk. Even one on one she's very reluctant to talk about what is really bothering her, she says that she doesn't want to have to rely on me as a crutch, but that's exactly what's happening. Everytime she falls flat on her face she needs me to hold her up. I think it's time to just let her go on her own and if she screws up, she can learn on her own. It's not like she hasn't been given the tools to succeed on her own. She's been going to church way longer than I have. It all starts with small compromises! When the small sins are allowed to come into our lives, that's where Satan grabs ahold of our ankle and won't let go. Only when we allow God to renew our minds is when Satan let's go. I don't understand why anyone would choose to live a life apart from God, He is the only one that has brought true joy to my life. But, to know God and then walk away, it's like what the heck, are you on crack!!! But to each his own I guess.  TTFN

      I feel like I suck. I'm supposed to be a spiritual mentor, but feel like a failure. For some reason one of my girls is so up and down in her Christianity. It has only been a month since Coram Deo, but now she isn't sure she even wants to be a Christian. Anytime things start getting hard, she gives up. I won't always be there to pick up the pieces when she falls apart. I'm considering talking to Pastor Shawn and seeing what he suggests, I really think it would be fun to go back to the high school side of ministry, and hang out with the kids. The Union feels so clicky, we had an event at Wiggy Field a few weeks ago and of all the regulars that attend, I barely knew half of them! So, is there something wrong with me, is it the people in my group? I try my hardest and never seem to see results. We never grow in numbers, when someone does come they are loony toons and aren't allowed to come back. I feel like I put so much time and energy into something that produces nothing. Well gotta go.

      Hi all, my life is so boring right now. I feel like I'm in this huge rut, I sleep all day, not as great as it sounds, then get up and am basically sitting around the house all day! I am so used to being on the go all the time that I'm starting to go stir crazy. To bad Rockford sucks, and there aren't many job opportunities. My small group is going awesome, we actually have a girl whose from Spain, as a foreign exchange student, until the end of July coming. She doesn't know God at all, but we're working on making Him known to her. By the time she's ready to leave, she should have enough head knowledge to be able to make a conscious decision. Even if she doesn't come to know Him in the next few weeks, the seeds have been planted and it's up to God to make sure they come into fruition. Well I have to go and start preparing the message for tonight's small group, believe it or not, I'm taking all the raps from Coram Deo and doing them in small group so everyone has the opportunity to hear what we learned up in podunct, WI. This is the final week then I have to plan something else. I can't wait until RMC comes back, I'm going to be so much more organized this year!

      There is a song, and the words are this:   We will always put our trust in You  For your unfailing love towards us  We direct all of our praise to You  It is freedom jus to trust in You   So pour me out like water (at your feet)  Spend my life do what you want (do what you want with me)  Let me dissappear so all that's seen (all that's seen is You)  Take us away to be lost in You   You're faithful forever, no one could love us like You do  You saved us, You freed us, You gave us all our life brand new  The reasons are countless, it takes eternity to  Declare You as holy, and we will serve You all our days   And that is why we worship You  We worship You   &nbsp;  It is freedom to trust in You completely. When we just let You take control of each one of our steps that is taken in life, there is no need to worry. By releasing control, freedom takes place! There is no pressure on us to take the correct sequence of steps, if there is obedience to Your voice. When the Shepherd moves the flock, they follow because there is complete trust that He knows what is best. The same applies to our everyday lives, all that is required for success is listening to God's voice. He shows the way, all we need to do is follow it. God won't lead us into the wilderness and abandon us! So it is true freedom to sit back and let God direct us, instead of trying to do it all on our own!

      My Small group is going to cease to exist as of August 24th. I've decided to go back to the world of teenagers, drama, and hormones. It's really all God's timing. I was praying about it on Tuesday before small group later one of my guys told me his last night was coming up, cause he's going away to school this fall, so that was another one down (my main girl, little bit of backsliding going on) and another of my girls is getting married an moving to California. To top it off I was talking to my friend online and she told me that my RMC guy is definately not coming back for a 2nd year. So this only made the decision easier. I would have Dawn and possible Katie Beal, so is it really worth it for 2 people? Even if my main girl comes around again, I don't think she needs me to be the leader, it would be more beneficial for her to go to a different group and have a new start! So I'm thinking about going to help be apart of the group Sketch 37, it should be a great time. I love the people that run it!

      Why do people choose to backslide? What does the world have to offer? The answer to that is pain. Sin is fun for a season, but pretty soon it bites back. The one who has a drink never expects to become an alcoholic. The same is true with any sin. It starts a compromise, then gradually it becomes consuming. The only thing that I want to consume me is the Lord, Jesus Christ. He is the only thing truly worth living for. The things of this world are pleasant, until the consequences and reality catch up. Is there a point when one goes to far to return? Does the enemy harden their hearts so much that this is possible? Our pride gets in the way and interferes with God's plans for our lives way to often! Guilt overshadows grace in the forefront of our finite minds! The feeling of no escape from sin feels imminent, we've painted ourselves into a corner and are now trapped. Why is it the first person (Jesus) that we should call on is always the last resort. Are we trying to punish ourselves for falling short? If that is the case, then we've lost the game a long time ago! We were born with a sin nature, there is really nothing we can do about that except allow Jesus into our hearts. When we are washed by the Holy Spirit of God, it's a refining process. All the dross and impurities are melted away leaving a pure metal behind. Our lives are like this, we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb and made spotless! What fools we are as mortals, even though the big picture has been laid out in front of us we refuse to acknowledge it! When will they figure it out? When they hit rock-bottom? Or does it take something greater, near death experiences? What will help them understand the value of their lives. So many experiencing much hurt and trouble, yet still go on living the same purposeless life. Living from one high or drunken stupor to the next. Only when we truly are transformed by Christ is when sin can't touch us.
