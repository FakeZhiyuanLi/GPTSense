      So today was a day of firsts, and a day of "as usuals" ....   1. Obviously its the first time I've felt compelled to put up a post. Bittersweet.   2. Well .... this is where the story/pouring-out of my soul/spouting of my thoughts begins ....   So, against better judgment (never mine - always someone else's) .... I picked up a shift at work today. I was  supposed  to have a full seven days off from my clerical/admin job to focus on my research, me, my brothers, packing, paperwork, everything but the Neurosurgery and Trauma department at St. Mike's.   Now, I love my job. I've been working at the same place for 5 years now, and I've actually been there 5.5 years because I started out as a co-op student for a semester back in grade 12. So I've been at St. Mike's since I was 17, and was by far the youngest employee in Neurosurgery and Trauma, and I actually still am. This has advantages and disadvantages. But so does just about everything right.   Having started there at a young age (relatively speaking - most of the people I work with are my parents' age), a lot of the ladies are somewhat motherly towards me, and, even as an almost 23-yr-old, I still get the occasional nurse that will come and pat me on the head and say "Ohh Camy, we've watched you grow up.." etc. I could do without the patting on the head like a 5-year old child, but its nothing I do&nbsp;or would complain about, sometimes its actually sweet (depending on the person).   Sometimes though, I feel I'm taken advantage of because I'm "the young one" and this, to many of the 40+ year olds often translates into "she doesn't know what she's doing" and "she doesn't need/deserve to be treated with respect even though she's my co-worker"; the fact that I've been doing my job, and doing it damn well, for the past 5 years seems to go out the window - what remains is that I've been there since I was a kid, and thus I'm still the kid, will always be a kid, and be nothing more than a kid.   Respect is important to me, and recently, the way I've been spoken to has been far from respectful. I've been spoken down to like a disobedient child, in ways my mother has never even spoken to me,  ever . The past 4 days were amazing, I was actually able to forget all this, which is why I agreed to&nbsp;go in today. Unfortunately, I was still "the young one" when I stepped off the elevator on the ninth floor at 7:30 this morning.   Today was the first time in five and a half years that I truly wished I hadn't come into work, and that I was prepared to leave less than 10 minutes after having walked in. I love my job, and for the most part, I love the people I work with (there's always a few, and always will be a few, that test that love). I'm one of the few people my age that usually looks forward to going to work because I miss the familiar faces and even the work. There's a lot of satisfaction in my job; I may not be the one directly treating/healing the patient, but I usually have a role in the family's coping, preparation, and a whole lot of interaction with both patient and family.   Today was also the first time I ever cried at work. Well, not exactly - but it was the first time I cried for myself, if that makes sense. I've cried at work 3 times.   The first was while I was still a co-op student; I walked into a patient's room behind a nurse,&nbsp;and just when I looked up, I watched him die, right in front of my eyes, with his younger brother hugging him and crying. This man was only 22 years old, HIV positive, and had had a brain tumor. His brother was 19. This was also the first time I'd ever watched someone die. Traumatic experience. Enough said.   The second time was 3 years ago, when a very friendly 76 year old man died sitting in a chair in the hallway waiting for his wife and grandson to come for a visit. He had a DNR order, Do Not Resuscitate (ie. if he goes into Code Blue - cardiac arrest, doctors and nurses are not to revive him, he and his family have decided that they want nature to take its course). When I was told, sitting at my desk, that he had died, sitting there in the hall waiting, I went to the washroom and cried my eyes out at the thought of him dying alone, in such a way.   The third time was actually earlier this summer. We had a patient, a young man about 27 years old, with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding between the surrounding tissue layers of the brain). He and his wife had gotten married less than a year ago, and he was in the hospital for about 2 weeks. During this time his wife and I talked quite a bit, and in some way, I sort of became a confidante. One day when I came into work he was doing quite poorly, and she asked me to sit with her in his room for a while. Sitting there, holding her hand, and she holding his, I watched him die, and watched this young lady, just a year older than me, watch the love of her life slip away from her.   I realize I digress beyond belief.   Today I cried for myself. I tried not to, but - when I realized I couldn't leave&nbsp;that, although I hadn't even been given the chance to put down my bag before getting railed for something not of my doing for probably the sixth or seventh shift in a row,&nbsp;I'd have to put my bag away and suffer through 12 hours of hell, - I was frustrated to the point where I wasn't crying out of self-pity, it was just the frustration I was bottling within me manifesting itself in annoying tears. These tears I find the worst - when I'm angry and frustrated and can't do much about it, the effort of keeping the frustration exploding always backfires into tears, which has led me, over the course of my life thus far to gain the equally frustrating stigma of being overly-emotional. Its like a stupid cycle of frustration turning into tears leading to more frustration leading to more tears leading to ...   More importantly -  today was the first time I felt lonely at work . Lonely for someone my age working in my department or in the same role as mine, someone who'll understand my situation because they've been in my department or been at the hospital as long as I have. So maybe here is where a little self-pity came in, but I feel justified in "indulging" myself in a little of that today, so if you're rolling your eyes at me, that's fine, roll away.   There  are  some people close to my age, some even younger, but they're student volunteers&nbsp;that, when they talk to me, only ask me about application processes for professional school, or how to study/prepare for the MCAT.   Today I wanted someone that I could call and say "I need to get off the floor for 15 minutes, can you meet me in the Victoria lobby and let me vent for a bit?" Either that or I needed a little soundproof room that I go and just scream in, to relieve my frustration. But neither exists. The people my age that work at St. Mike's work in roles that have them moving from floor to floor on a daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly basis, so they don't become a part of the politics of any department. The soundproof room hasn't been included in the blueprints for remodelling the Neuro/Trauma floor. And since neither of those 2 options existed, my frustration liquefied while sitting in my manager's office trying to explain in a calm manner with etiquette why I wasn't my "normal cheerful self" and why my "delightful and always&nbsp;grand smile" was missing.   Ok, so there's really no point to this post, I never tried to make you think there would be. Its just a rant. And now that I'm again thinking, "I just want to forget this day", I'm also realizing that I'm giving it eternal life in the worldwide web by posting it here. Great. But that's the point of a journal isn't it - to allow you to look back later and reflect and see how you've changed. Bah.   Zena: You didn't say it, and I know you never would, but you don't know  how  many times today I told myself on your behalf "I told you so" ..... Next time punch me. Please.
