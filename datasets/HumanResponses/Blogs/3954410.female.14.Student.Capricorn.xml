        Pieces of Me -Ashlee Simpson       &nbsp;   On a Monday I am waiting Tuesday I am fading And by Wednesday I can’t sleep Then the phone rings I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cause you’ve come to rescue me Fall, with you I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath I hope it lasts Ohhhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhh It’s as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me I am moody and messy I get restless and it’s senseless How you never seem to care When I’m angry you listen Make me happy it’s a mission And you won’t stop till I’m there Fall, sometimes I fall so fast When I hit that bottom crash You’re all I have Ohhhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhh It’s as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me How do you know? Everything I’m about to say Am I that obvious? And if it’s written on my face I hope it never goes away Yea On a Monday I am waiting By Tuesday I am fading  Into your arms So I can breathe Ohhhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhh It’s as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me       &nbsp;   This song is for he knows who he is......I dont think he knows it but .....i dont think i could ever go out wit anyone else now that ive found the best.
