						    Sonnet XXVII   clamped in a tough metropolis  ahead with ease over suburbia  the sun quotes hot flashes  over oceans and lakes  trees and the north wind, nature  calls for the baptism of your  soul, attached to metal's grip  a use of vices, metamorphosis  iron butterflies in concrete jungles  a little rock speaks of landslides  exaggeration of such a young child  run wild in the wilderness  run naked in your life  mother nature is calling for your baptism.

						    Frailty    truth be told  I am not  the most courageous of voices   I tremble when I speak  and I shake when I breathe  I close my eyes  and hope not to embarrass myself  when it's my turn to say something  I watch everyone when it's their moment  and how they use it  some waste it on something frivolous  others use it to actually let people  hear their voices   I do both   I ramble, I stutter, I vomit,  I freeze, I miss lines, I forget to bow  and I always stumble on the punch line  but I also try to open, inspire, give hope  to crack a smile, a giggle  and I always try to give a hundred percent  but I sometimes fall short at ninety-nine  and leave that remaining one percent for you  so that you can give me something to hold on to,  to show me that I'm not alone  when it's my turn and that you understand  I am not the most courageous of voices  but you loved the fact that  I tried

						   When The City Sleeps   we run wild until our feet bleed we bomb your streets we grow up quickly to survive we ride trains from the Bronx to Coney Island we walk until the sun wakes up  we hang on the corners we run from cops we take control of  kingdoms we leave our fingerprints on granite we find our purpose in the music  we break tradition on corner stones we yell for the gloaming we grow in numbers as the hours pass we spread like wildfire we plan your downfall  we defend ourselves we hide in the shadows to save ourselves we push back our fate we search for God in the traffic lights we wander until we find meaning  when the city sleeps  we wax poetic drunk on our own innocence we lock the rhythm of new york in our bones we look at ourselves in the hudson river we smoke life on the Brooklyn Bridge we jump off the Empire State building  we are artists with brick canvas we change your views on us when one of you ask us why? we are with your daughters we steal our childhood back we are elegant in our ignorance (some of us)  we are loud, brash and obnoxious just like you we lay down on Broadway to watch the stars we rest in 24 hour diners and only order fries we leave our names behind so you can try to find us we wear noise pollution like a pair of headphones  we hold up the heavens with our angel headed hipster slang walk we write quotes for middle america to take back home we draw new sunsets on the side of buildings to breathe we cut it open and drink from her veins we sit on garbage cans and lay on steps  we catch the first train in and the last train out we rest on park benches and count the stars we rack our livelihood up our backs and sell it to survive we are our own gods and hope someone will pray for us we feel more comfortable waiting until dusk calls us again  we wait for her to rise we watch her buildings stretch into the sky we take notes of her beauty and tell the people we hold her heart in our pockets we dot her eyes and cross her streets  when the city sleeps...

						   yeah so this weekend was The Pelo Bueno Book Release Party and i felt great to see everyone. I REally have to say that the Acentos Crew is really family, first they were there early and there real late, they were practically the only poetry people who i invited that actually came out. So much respect to Oscar, Fish, Rich, Jessica, Ed, and Shaggy. My Boys TCK (Top City Krew) was there, it was really a reunion for us, i haven't seen all of them or been in the same room with them since 2000 i think, i really dont want to have that kind of stretch. This Thursday in downtown Brooklyn at a spot called "Premium Goods" C train to Lafayette, My boy, Kel 5mh has a gallery show check: http://www.soulsuite.com/Kel5MH.htm for more info. But yeah it was dope on Sunday, i wish everyone i invited would of came through but you know "Que sera sera". A-Rod is a Yankee, i have to be dreaming. READ: e.e. cummings, Listen: Elbow (Cast Of Thousands), and i hope everyone is well. my son is beautiful and i cry when i see him.

						    DARK SOUL PRESS ADVISORY     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR FURTHER DETAILS FEBRUARY 4, 2004                                     CONTACT SHAGGY FLORES AT 703-585-5264    Nuyorican Poet Bonafide Rojas Releases Pelo Bueno -- Independent Publishing Company to hold historic book release at famed New York Bowery Poetry Club     Dark Souls Press, a Nuyorican owned independent publishing company dedicated to promoting the visual, oral, and literary traditions of the African Diaspora, announced the long awaited book release of Pelo Bueno: A Day In the Life of A Nuyorican Poet by Bonafide Rojas. The historic book release party will occur on February 15, 2004, at the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City.     Famed Nuyorican poet Bonafide Rojas, a native of The Bronx, NYC, is a poet/musician/photographer/teacher who is at the forefront of the current Latino literary renaissance. He was the 2002 SLAM THIS! Poetry champion and was also a member of the 2002 NYC | Union Square Slam team and the 2003 Chicago Wicker Park Slam team. He has worked with Teachers and Writers (NY), ASPIRA of NY (NY), ENLACE (NY), Muevete! (NY), Youth Speaks (CA), the Guild Complex (IL), Young Chicago Authors (IL), and the Louder Arts Collective (NY).      Nuyorican poet Bonafide Rojas follows in the tradition of Julia De Burgos, Clemente Soto Velez, Pedro Pietri, Victor Hernandez Cruz, Tato Laviera, and the many others who have pushed a Puerto Rican literary canon. His work can be found in Bum Rush the Page: a Def Poetry Jam (Three Rivers Press, 2002), Role Call: A Generational Anthology of Social and Political Black Literature and Art (Third World Press, 2002), The Centro Journal, an academic publication of The Center for Puerto Rican Studies (Hunter College, 2001) focusing on the next generation of Nuyorican poets, Blu Magazines Puerto Rican Issue - Roots and Culture, and Freedom to Speak, the first anthology by Poetry Slam, Incorporated.     Pelo Bueno, through poems like Creed of a Graffiti Writer, Invisible Ones, and 25 Years In, lets the reader see the maturity of a Latino writer spitting in the wind, his Nommo creating poems that resurrect ancestors and endorse empowerment. The book features artwork by fronterizo artist Francisco Enrique Delgado, an introduction by African Diaspora Scholar & Writer Louis Reyes Rivera, and an introduction by publisher and Nuyorican poet Shaggy Flores.      Heres the voice of the new Nuyorican, the poetic tales of Rican life at the millennium. Bonafide is rooted in those familiar old mean streets of El South Bronx y El Barrio; he tells and retells the daily rituals of the hood then and now, drugs and dominoes, police brutality and graffiti immortality, Sandra María Esteves cultural ceremonies and Pedro Pietri life-in-death obituaries. What makes him Bonafide is that he celebrates all parts of his quirky self, his long hippie hair and love for rock and roll, his adoration of Che and Julia de Burgos and Neruda and Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Gandhi and Jimi Hendrix. In Pelo Bueno, we see the invisible and hear the silenced and the mute. Here, for a change, naps and kinks and fros, braids and cornrows is not pelo malo. Thats good hair, rich, full, sculpted pelo bueno. -Juan Flores  Puerto Rican Scholar, Author of From Bomba to Plena      The book release party for Pelo Bueno demonstrates that while many in the Nuyorican canon would be content with poems that only speak to their personal experiences, Rojas chooses to personalize issues of oppression and cultural preservation.  His dialectic focuses on several themesthe immigrant experience in America, tales of wasted talent in an Andy Warhol Era, and visions of war in faraway lands. Through his use of language, the rhythms of Hip-Hop and Rock & Roll speak with a Bronx Boogie attitude that reflects his Nuyorican roots. A child of the Puerto Rican Diaspora transplanted to the streets of Nueva Yol, Mr. Rojas uses his words as blades, cutting through the absurdity and deceit that often plague our judgment.      The blade-edged gospel of the city, in the deft and capable clutches of Bonafide, jolts and transports the congregation. This is no typical urban griot spewing worn rhythms. Bonafide sizzles with unflinching focus, and crafts uncommon stanzas using a language that virtually burns with his signature. There is no voice like this. -Patricia Smith  Author of Close to Death & Big Towns, Big Talk    The book release party, hosted by the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City, starts at 8pm on the 15th of February. The Bowery Poetry Club was created by legendary poet, writer, and scholar Bob Holman as a place where cutting edge poets could develop and share their craft. Poets performing that night include Willie Perdomo, Crystal Lee Endsley, Monique Jarvis, Jane Alberdeston Coralin, Roger Bonair Agard, Tish Benson, Lemon, Louis Reyes Rivera, Oscar Bermeo, Fish Vargas, Guy Lecharles Gonzalez, Soulfighter, Crystal Senter Brown, Ed Garcia, Caridad de La Luz - La Bruja, Benjamin Hughes, the Dark Souls Collective, Rich Villar, Shaggy Flores, and many more of todays hottest poets!     Signed copies of the book will be available at the book release party. Advance copies can be ordered at www.shaggyflores.com. Admission to the event is only $10.00.

						   back in new york, took a train from Chicago to Detroit and chilled in Detroit-Wayne County Airport, i felt like Holden Caufield. It fel like Fight Club, i thought something was going to exploded. My flight was early, got in around 8:30, my parents picked me up, i had to teach Tuesday in Queens with the Queens Cultural Project, funny it's a guy from The Bronx they hired. That night was the 1 year Anniversary for   Acentos  it was good, good venue, good people (well some of them). Wednesday i started teaching in a school in The Bronx, weird thing is that i have barely taught workshops in The Bronx, so it felt good. I was there with Roger early that morning to recruit a little more for my class. Class was good, hopefully it'll be better next week. I'm trying to get a job at Urban Outfitters, why not i buy or get enough shit from there, why not 40% off, you know. Saturday was  Louder Than Words  hosted by Guy urlLink   it was fresh but i think i will blown up one day screaming at the panel for answers that tippy toe around shit.   i've been in a sulky lately, then i have these bursts of energy which feels weird and i know some people feel uncomfortable (which i dont know why i'm writing this). I feel so fucking bi-polar it's not even funny. BUT SO FUCKING WHAT. i'm listening to  "The Grey Album"  sounds good, actually listenable.  i've been listening to alot of Dylan, Television, Mars Volta, Jane's Addiction, and Refused.  a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z.

						   So i've been teaching at Oak Park/River Forest in Illinois for the last few days. It's been great, the students are attentive and funny. They've been writing and I had some of them interpret some of my old poems (sounds weird coming from someone else reading ("Rock and Roll Puerto Rican"). There are a few students who i have alot of hope for, there's one kid who cursed at me the first day, i thought it was kind of harsh but funny too. During lunch some the teachers eat together and we just talk alot of shit about everything possible. Makes me feel i should be a teacher but only there and teaching what i teach, Poetry and talking about music. (lucky me)  See You Soon Bonafide

						   today was a little hectic, a lot of phone calls to alot of people. I start teaching two classes when i get back from Chicago, one in The Bronx and one in Queens. And i start teaching one in Oak Park, IL on Monday. I jammed with Vini and Chris tonight being the first session for The Mona Passage, it went real well, i feel real comfortable with both of them for the simple fact that i've known both of them for at least 6 years. Jack Argueos was at Acentos tonight and his feature was 10 minutes (what the hell is that?).   so tomorrow is again my last day in new york for the week and a half. I'm going to see John, perform at New Skool Poetics in Chicago, and teach and hopefully make more money that i thought about. Time to see myself, (a buck 50 folks, a buck 50).  i talked to an old friend of mine: Timmy. Tim was one of the older guys i hung out with when i was around sixteen. He was real good peoples then his kidneys started to fail then he had a transplant then they failed but had another one and i talked to him and it was dope. i miss him he's my boy.   my boy Will is next to me asking "what the hell am i doing?" so i tell him "I'm blogging bitch back off me!" (with authority) then he stole my gummi bears and scooter, bastardsssssssssssssssssssssss.

						   today we said goodbye to Rev. Pedro Pietri and it was a beautiful event. You know what i hate when someone passes it ends up being a reunion of sorts. There were people there who knew me before i took the name "Bonafide". People who have known me since '94 when i volunteered for the Muevete Conference, it was really good to see all these people in the same room. Willie Perdomo, Sandra Maria Esteves, Reals (TCK), Tato (Yerba Buena), Alano (Ricanstruction), Hector (Welfare Poets) Fidel (Palo Monte), shit the biggest surprise was Rafael Cancel Miranda and Elizam Escobar coming out to read and appreciate Pedro like we all did. There were alot of people there and it was beautiful, i was waiting for Pedro to jump out and go "BoooYahhhhhhhhhhh, i got you silly motherf*ckers" but thats just me. I will definately miss him, i am indeed one of his illegitimate sons.  i've been in EL Barrio the past few days and i've forgotten how i like being around there, i may be around there alot for days to come.  I've been working on my next two books, "When The City Sleeps " and "Breaking Bread" (which i think may be the title, i dont know yet). It's weird "Pelo Bueno" took so long that it feels strange having so much work laying around that didn't make the "Pelo Bueno" cut. Hopefully i can put one of them out in the next two years, maybe sooner.

						   spent the day with Oscar Bermeo, Michael Cirelli and my friend Dara Rose at a school in Queens. I was upstaged my a mouse in the auditorium during my poem. Oscar fell alseep in the car, i wore my funny hat again and i had too many donuts this morning. i finally printed my poem out today so that will be posted soon. the day looks dreary and drizzle and the fazzzzishle is off the hizzle. (what the hell am i typing about).  tomorrow I will be hosting a preliminary bout for the Urban Word Youth Poetry Slam at Carlito's up in the El Barrio/Upper East Side for the yuppies. That will be great to see the young performers get busy, I've seen so many in Chicago, i don't know many in NYC. so tomorrow will be great. get there by 2:30 106th & Lexington. one love  Bonafide Rojas climbing up the walls

						   yesterday i went job hunting, applied at Urban Outfitters, my boy Damien who was a DJ at my book party is a manager, so if i don't get a job there then i really need to find out what the hell is wrong with my records I need to check if there is a warrant for my arrest of i actually have felonys laying around in there. that would suck so bad. waited for Raze Regal to come through but he never showed up. i hate that.  later that night I saw Oscar at the Blue Ox for their BCA poetry reading. it' not Acentos i'll tell you that but when did they get a pool table. i was with Angel last night for a little while, we actually had a man to man talk which is weird since i've known Angel since i was 9 (i believe).  today has been a little slow and weird, i went to mindbuilders to see Oscar and handle some business. had an arguement on the phone, not really an arguement but it's damaging my outlook on the day. i really wish certain things in my life were better. but who am i to complain. i'm 26, i have a book, a healthy baby boy and a roof over my head. Americans are so greedy and i say American because i live here, puerto ricans, dominicans, cubans, ecuadorians, mexicans, not all of them are greedy like Americans but we're all greedy somehow. you know.   I miss my youth and the having the ability of not having a care in the world. but those days are long gone and G.W. Bush is still our president and Kerry scares me, and Radiohead said they're not recording another album because their contract is finished. Capitol better hurry up and sign them before I do.  Pedro Pietri died either last night or this morning and i will not mourn his passing but celebrate his life and work. Pedro was a weirdo and that's why i like him so much, he to me was a chip off the original shoulder, the last puerto/rican/dadaist/surrealist/spaced/out/poetic/sun/ra/smoke/a/joint/on/the/empire/state/building and for that i admired him. One time in his house I was invited to his house for a Pampleteros collective with Sam, Stephanie and a few other heads i was too young to recognize (19 yrs old i think) and i remember him throwing a book with nails sticking out and i almost caught and he looks at me and says "That's Hard Poetry, Son" and i love that shit. if i'm ever considered to be as eccentric as people thought Pedro was (which i thought we was normal) it would be honor to be even mentioned in the same breath. i miss you Pedro, you and your extended hand.

						   ok so now that i'm calm but still pissed, i was reading Rich's blog, and i like his recent entry so i will do the same:     Nice Box!    So, say you were meeting a new person - blind date, new friend, who knows. And you wanted them to have some idea of what kind of person you are, and who you are. But you can't actually tell them in so many words. Instead, you have to give them a box, with a dozen things in it for them to ponder over.  What would you put in the box? No cheating - you're not allowed to include things such as links to your blog.  WHAT I'D PUT IN MINE:  1. Jimi Hendrix's "Are You Experienced"    (to show my hero)   2. Pablo Neruda's "Residence on Earth"    (to show my reason to write)   3. a sticker with my old graff tag   (to show the past)   4. a slice of pizza   (to show my addiction)   5. a picture of my mom and I when i was a little kid with alot less hair   (to show my love)   6. My red guitar with the radiohead sticker    (to show my dreams)   7. a copy of "Pelo Bueno"    (to show my present)   8. a Yankees Hat    (to show my loyalty)   9. a paystub from YCA, The Guild Complex and Aspira of NY    (to show my work)   10. Journals from 95-2000    (to show my flaws)   11. Radiohead's OK Computer   (to show my insecurities)   12. a picture of John Pablo smiling   (to show my future)

						   back in new york, the weather's great, it's finally not completely frozen, wrote a response to Rich's "A Howl in Winter" www.revolutionaryscum.blogspot.com called "A Whisper In Winter"  but i do think the scarf i have on most of the time is kind of "out there" but so what, who cares. Saw John Pablo a few days ago, it was great, he's so big, 16 pounds of beautiful baby boy, i taught him how to air guitar and he loved it, smiled and giggled, but being around his mother's family really gets to me, i always feel like i can't be myself. (even though i know i've been a A**hole) doesn't mean i'll always be one, just have one.   there's a great show in Chicago on March 13th at the Chicago Historical Society, 15 of the best poets Chicago has produced in the past 10 years, with the exception of Regie Gibson and Tyhiemba Jess who are out of town. word i'm hyped and i'm teaching at Oak Park River Forest H.S. when i get back to The Big ILL, the Go, i'm listening to a demo Dennis Kim (Denizen Kane for the people who don't know his real name). word it's sweet, i'm trying to get's this hip hop folk record with him, when we have time, we could finish it in a week, with all the material we have, but heads are busy.  until next time Bonafide not a metrosexual (but is very strange)

						   week has been short but complicated, trying to find a home for my son and a daycare, shit is expensive in New York, Urban Outfitters didn't hire me which makes me a bit mad, hosted a show on the weekend which had Welfare Poets, Aukebulan and GAME performing, i hate hosting, i never enjoy myself but the bands were dope, can't wait for The Mona Passage to finally be complete, alot of people seem to be supportive enough, i have to see if i have the time and energy for it, decided to focus on  "When The City Sleeps"  and make it one manuscript and just focus it on New York and keep the other poems for another project.  The Bar 13 Slam Finals are in a few days (more like 2 weeks) and i feel weird and unprepared for it, i haven't been writing, New York has so many things to do that i feel like i'm wasting time if i stay home and type, i need to sit down and be disciplined like i have been for some time now, i need some new poems becasuse i think the old ones are mad at me, i like Luis Cartagena everytime i see him we talk about the short and secretive love affiar of Lorca and Dali, two of my favorite artists of the 20th Century, everytime i see him, so i have to get him Lorca's biography, i've been listening to alot of David Bowie  "Ziggy Stardust Live"  and i'm really enjoying Talking Heads, check out the new MUSE album, everyone else told you too so will I, and the new ELBOW album  "Cast Of Thousands" , the television is on in the background, The Timberwolves are up by 6 and thank god the Yankees won tonight, i would've cried.

Preacherman, don't tell me, Heaven is under the earth. I know you don't know What life is really worth. It's not all that glitters is gold; 'Alf the story has never been told: So now you see the light, eh! Stand up for your rights.  Come on!  Get up, stand up:  stand up for your rights!

						   Hurrah i awake from yesterday alive but the war is here to stay so my love catherina and me decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea not to die but to be re-born away from a life so battered and torn.... forever... oh say can you see its really such a mess every inch of earth is a fighting nest giant pencil and lip-stick tube shaped things continue to rain and cause screaming pain and the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red as our feet find the sand and the sea is strait ahead.. strait ahead..... well its too bad  that our friends  cant be with us today well thats too bad "the machine  that we built  would never save us" thats what they say (thats why they aint coming with us today) and they also said "its impossible for man to live and breath underwater.. forever" was their main complaint (yeah)  and they also threw this in my face: they said anyway you know good well it would be beyond the will of God and the grace of the King (grace of the King yeah yeah) so my darling and I make love in the sand to salute the last moment  ever on dry land our machine has done its work played its part well without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell  starfish and giant foams  greet us with a smile before our heads go under we take a last look at the killing noise  of the out of style... the out of style, out of style  (c) Jimi Hendrix

						   Darkness at the break of noon Shadows even the silver spoon The handmade blade, the child's balloon Eclipses both the sun and moon To understand you know too soon There is no sense in trying.  Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn Suicide remarks are torn From the fool's gold mouthpiece The hollow horn plays wasted words Proves to warn That he not busy being born Is busy dying.  Temptation's page flies out the door You follow, find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar You feel to moan but unlike before You discover That you'd just be One more person crying.  So don't fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.  As some warn victory, some downfall Private reasons great or small Can be seen in the eyes of those that call To make all that should be killed to crawl While others say don't hate nothing at all Except hatred.  Disillusioned words like bullets bark As human gods aim for their mark Made everything from toy guns that spark To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark It's easy to see without looking too far That not much Is really sacred.  While preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the president of the United States Sometimes must have To stand naked.  An' though the rules of the road have been lodged It's only people's games that you got to dodge And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.  Advertising signs that con you Into thinking you're the one That can do what's never been done That can win what's never been won Meantime life outside goes on All around you.  You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks They really found you.  A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy Insure you not to quit To keep it in your mind and not fergit That it is not he or she or them or it That you belong to.  Although the masters make the rules For the wise men and the fools I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.  For them that must obey authority That they do not respect in any degree Who despise their jobs, their destinies Speak jealously of them that are free Cultivate their flowers to be Nothing more than something They invest in.  While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise Outsiders they can freely criticize Tell nothing except who to idolize And then say God bless him.  While one who sings with his tongue on fire Gargles in the rat race choir Bent out of shape from society's pliers Cares not to come up any higher But rather get you down in the hole That he's in.  But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.  Old lady judges watch people in pairs Limited in sex, they dare To push fake morals, insult and stare While money doesn't talk, it swears Obscenity, who really cares  Propaganda, all is phony.  While them that defend what they cannot see With a killer's pride, security It blows the minds most bitterly For them that think death's honesty Won't fall upon them naturally Life sometimes Must get lonely.  My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards False gods, I scuff At pettiness which plays so rough Walk upside-down inside handcuffs Kick my legs to crash it off Say okay, I have had enough What else can you show me?  And if my thought-dreams could be seen They'd probably put my head in a guillotine But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.  (C) Bob Dylan

						   so this is the first week i can say i am a father.  John Pablo Rojas moved to NYC last saturday and i've been  with him everyday since, the kid is cute as hell and don't take my word for it, ask my mom.  John makes these weird growling noises which kind of scare me in the middle of the night. He has a widow's peak like i do, has chubby legs like i used to, big cheeks like used to, but you know he's much cuter than i ever will be and much smarter, he speaks Japanese and French already, (it could be gibberish but i'm being optimistic).  I had a show with Oscar and Fish on Wednesday at the Nuyorican, I always love having shows with friends because we act a fool, not like i don't act a fool when i have shows with other people.  I know it's getting hot in New York, don't be surprised if i cut my damn hair off because it is getting HOT in NYC. for real.  Yours Truly Bonafide

						   i know i talked about my foot being messed up, but my ass was in the hospital, how the hell do you get admitted for your foot. iwatched the lakers game, sweat my ass off in this May heat, called Oscar and The Big O helped me out with what is going on in the world outside of my 10th floor room. He told me that word was "Bone didn't make the team, he tried to jump out the window, Bone didn't make the team he started doing smack". close enough but eveeything could be better. John is in town and my mom is going crazy and puerto rican mother like she is.  my goal is to be a good father and the bass player for the Mars Volta  Bonafide

						   went to Flushing Town Hall today with my class and saw a real cool Afro-Cuban band and of course my class were alittle out of control, found out Ishle is the Queens Poet Laureate, that's real dope, John Pablo will be here next week, i'm really excited and a bit nervous, i haven't seen him in a while and i don't want him not to like me, you know. i want him to see me, smile and love me forever. but i know it'll be different, more like "CHANGE MY DIAPERS, BOY!!!".   Finals is coming up, a bit nervous, a bit excited, shit everything feels weird right now, where are the planets aligned, i am feeling real funny.  Weather's nice. good too many bills. bad  Bonafide says goodbye

						   at Louder than Words yesterday, the main discussion was "What was the biggest change in our time in poetry or with poetry?" One of the things that i can agree with is being cynical with what you hear after a period in time. I came up on the scene, young as hell, just happy to be out, didn't care at all for Slam, didn't get into Slam until 2002 and i was performing in New York since '95-96. So i can understand why Rich, Oscar, Jessica, Fish and everyone i know who are very cynical with Slam is because they spend alot of time in a Slam venue, shit if i started in Slam in '95 by '98 i would of definately been burnt out, but i love that they all want to publish and get out there.   i didn't start thinking about getting published or putting a book together was until late '98-'99 and i was still very far from a respectable writer to MYSELF. let alone to anyone else, by '99 all i had was "The Creed Of a Grafitti Writer" to perform but i had "Invisble Ones", "War Pigs" and "The Epics of Abca" but i never performed them aloud. no pun intended.  But when i started slamming, i enjoyed it very much because i'm competitive and like winning but it is a love/hate relationship with going on stage and selling your poem like a new car or the new hot radio jam. my thing with people who have problems with Slam is stop coming to Slam venues, don't sign up to the Slam list, go hang out at the Nuyorican on the first Wednesday or the Bowery on Saturdays or Bar13 when it's theme night with no Slam. I like to Slam i don't like to Slam...i'm a Libra i can be indecisive...what's your excuse  Bonafide poetry advocate

						   today is tuesday and the weeks are flying by so fast, i am amazed it's summertime already, in the winter i was dying for it to be summer now summer is running by without saying hello.  John is getting so big, the kid stares at me and opens his mouth and puts out this screech, then stares at me then giggles, and i'm like "what the fuck did he just do?"  Genius, people, i'm tellin you now genius. wait until he actually starts talking..."You know father the main difference between Mozart and Beethoven is..." "What the fuck is he talking about?"  "When The City Sleeps" has been coming along, the new hotness...Aurora and The Gloaming came pretty quick and i have one for the east side, i'm enjoying taking time and trying to figure what am i going to say about NYC this time for the 1 millionth time that i haven't said already.  shameless plug: on Carmine and Bleeker there is a little bookstore called The Unoppressive Anti-Imperialist Bargain Bookstore  my friends and I have been going there for a few years and they buy or get the on remainder from big conglomerates like Borders and BN., i've gotten a million things from there:  From Kahlo to Camus to Zinn to Reed to Guevara to Neruda to Lorca to Lennon to Lenin to Marcos to Marquez to Dylan to Thomas to MLK to anyone you can think of but they don't always have the same books, so go there now and hopefully you'll get lucky like i sometimes do.

						   The Gloaming (West Side Postcard)  it's 7 o'clock in the evening  I'm sitting by the window  on the IRT 1 train  the sun is descending nights approaching like a thief   I don't like comparing dusk to a thief  thieves are much darker than night  I didn't know I loved steel so much and how steel lays on top of each other to cover their masters and dogs  can people love things  that arent animate guitars, radios, bikes  I've always loved high rises I would never come down  but I would find it weird marching ants that have mansions and drive jaguars  here I've loved eyes all the time whether staring or closed like  abandon buildings smiling with  an orange sunset on its lips   this wave of  light curling over the hills that Manhattan has on the west side crowned with mausoleums and St. John the Divine  stretched out as flat as possible the west side walls are fifty feet high  and the hobos walk the tracks from  the Freedom Tunnels that soon  will become another high rise   I know you can't hide poverty underneath  the trees of central park I know the streets swallow  the lights that you'll never see I didn't know I loved the sky cloudy or clear as it opens up over New Jersey and stretches to California  the blue voices are not  from blue people but from the breeze  that are running passed someone   Ive always knew I loved trees as it hovers over and whispers in my ear  there are no tears when they shed their leaves because they will be beautiful again  I never knew I loved roads  I dont drive and probably will never  have the drive to drive in the asphalt, granite  and tar I count the cracks in its face    the world flows past on both sides distant and mute  I was never so close to anyone in my life except on the rush hours  from Wall St to Times Square the battery operated entrepreneurs stop me  on the station between here and there    when I was eighteen  my life consisted of everything I could fit in my bag  from Che to Neruda to Camus to Campos  my back could take as much as I could give it  but at eighteen my life was valued less than now   I've written this somewhere before wandering through wanderlust streets  playing hide n seek with police officers on beat during graveyard shifts  a paper giant leading the way  I remember the stars  on top of my roof, I love them too watching them from the fire escape  cosmonauts are stars much bigger than comets but they look like huge diamonds on black velvet  my heart was in my mouth looking at them  my endless desire to grasp them, seeing them  I could even think of death and not feel at all sad  because if death is becoming a star, then so be it I never knew I loved the cosmos as much as  I  do  I knew I loved the sun especially when setting cherry-red as now in Manhattan it sometimes sets in postcard colors  photo taken from a boat on the Hudson but I could never paint it that way how can you paint the gloaming  the tunnels roar like a coarse hands  or shattered glass  or palpitating hearts  or tangled countries   I don't know why I love this city but all these passions sprawling forth  sitting by the window on the IRT 1 train is it because I chewed on my 9th  toothpick   or because Im alone  or is it because I'm half dead from thinking about  someone whose either uptown or downtown  the train is going underneath and now the tunnels  and their small lights  is infinity laughing at me  the train plunges on through the pitch-black night sparks fly and I watch the world disappear as if on  a journey of no return  *****************************************************************

						   Aurora (sunrise on Broadway tripping fantastic)  At the beginning of day the freaks of petty paradises  the face of lies and rocks  fly by the malnourished wind,  unlaced monsters and disaster river  forever carrying in the depths height deep as the floor of the sea  arrogant guards against the oppressive surroundings,  surveyed night and day by a cursed unpatriotic sun.  burgeoning with frail hunger  and pitted with smallpox alcohol  stranded in the dust of this town   the extreme deception desolate wounds  the waters of martyrs do not bear witness;  they fade and scatter in the empty wind   the screeching of soldiers  a life of babbling opened by aged poverty  rotting under the silence bursting with  fragile thickness humiliating by its grandiose nudity  the mouths will explode  the dreams will awake at the beginning of the day  this town will topple with its uncommon weight   its fate, no matter what self-conscious  fighting furiously with hours that have passed quickly  this morning with holy cracks in her face will again conjure the genius of solitude  The clothes on the chair at the foot of the bed   are illuminated by great wings of white satin gowns  with ships and now crouched in the chimney  i was watching for the silence of pavements  coal darkness that persists in projecting the shadow of its smoke  and the reflections of its eyes, while I walk on the pavement of  downtown Manhattan, clear noon, and I've been up all night, talking,  talking, listening to Jimi Hendrix memorize stanzas aloud,  singing dream remembering imagination toward apocalypse, a flash away, and the great dream of a poem   worshipping each letter at the beginning of the day as I go out and walk the street, look over my shoulder, Broadway, the battle of buildings shouldering each other   under a cloud, the century of backroom floor boards-- through breakdowns learning to be mad or madlike what is this life? toward the top of the sunrise   and the top of Manhattan is over the floor, and lays down on the sidewalk this place of poverty carrying strange to be strange magnificent, mourned, marred of heart, married to a dream, mortal maddened Utopia,   for years now  I still haven't written my history left it abstract with a few photos to run through the mind like electrical shocks. my opinion of the cosmos, I was lost--     my burden that I put on has broken my nose with  gas mask poison punches sneaked through my defense  at the beginning of the day   ******************************************************************

						   the finishing line is approaching with my workshops and i'm kind of blahzay about it.  I wished the schools could've backed the program more than they actually did. I been a bit scatterbrain lately and i don't want it to mess me up from my teaching ability, sometimes it does.  i've been reading Milan Kundera's "Unbearable Lightness of Being", and i'm really enjoying it, i don't read too much fiction but this has kept my short attention span from collapsing.  This is June it's hot sometimes i don't have money  for my sister's birthday what else is new  ho hum i'm tired   Bonafide

						   this week has been very stressful, i'm behind in work as usual, my son's mother is acting up more than usual (and i know she reads my blog, but i don't really care) at least my son is beautiful and writing is coming along with some projects i thought about, Chicago does not want to fade away, I need a real job, teaching is about to end in a few weeks, my sister's birthday is approaching real soon, no money for a present, hopefully i can muster something, my students are a bit wild, remind me of me, the weather has sucked lately, tomorrow is June 2nd Wednesday it'll probably rain, it has rained on Wednesday for the last month, maybe it's just me and a black cloud following me.  Bonafide hysterical and useless

						   Cinderblock Love Letter  at the towers of your native land the square where once you once stood at the empty windows of your eyes where your sons and daughters have annulled your existence  stitching your lips before you made a sound your body cracked into transparent pieces and your legs have detached themselves from the ground.  who will grieve for you, woman? does everyone think you are insignificant for their concern? in my heart i never will deny you, you who has suffered death because you chose to speak  under the brooklyn bridge the hudson river slips away with lovers diaries floating on the search for joy  the night is a clock running as the days go by with a swollen face to be held in your hand your embrace expires and expectation is always violent  the days are equally lost repeating old news with arrogance and cinderblock ignorance  on one side the framed photograph of yesterday is sliced by the glass shattered across two half-circles of cynical memories  a plastic smile engines of war innumerable kinds of bloodied branches.  the uncontrolled possibility infiltrate your hair ash and burnt wires  you wear this starched smocked cotton dress? who begged for mercy in the memory a bomb thrust in a hollowed prayer  your lips curve, spreading like gunfire the panic, the silence does a torn photograph still gather loving memories  let you be whole again. let you be the dream you wanted to be. (i never was enough for you)  this great love that never can be crushed by anyone let your body be a land where you are crowned with no false kisses who mumbles in the dark and who draws your veil across the stars? (i never was enough for you)  bearing lovely scars. a man driven from you an immigrant clutching hope finding only tangled ancient chains the soil the machine. the servant the hunger the dream. the poor  the one who dreamt our basics world still seraphim among of thieves dream a dream so strong, so new so clear that even those who doubt you will sing in every brick and stone,  in every highway unfurled in every street closed in every opened road in the small seas in the small homes of those who left without looking back  out of the rack and ruin of our meaningless death, the rape and rot and stealth and stab you must remain beautiful must redeem your land  tonight with this heavy burden we walk through naked rooms with blindfold heads  opening doors for possibility is there a need for heaven? at this hour, what our loving is burning. someone tell me should i sleep now  you keep a light on by your cranium your love for me is like sewing colors stitching uneven needle pierces through with each stroke of his hand.  at this hour, what is dead has not worried about us and we are now fugitives  someone tell me should i sleep now the streets keeps talking my mouth of teeth is rotten  a beard glass stained with breath of gasoline and tunnels  the baptismal fire, the common doves, the tap water  at this hour, what is alive is helpless kind and helpless while we live someone tell me to leave love alone it feels like burning nights running away.  burning through streams of flickering letters signs, billboards these machines throb quicker than your heart,  decapitated heads, silk canvases wrapped around the wounds believe in the fall of your age, it supposed to shine like sharp knuckles shine on you crazy diamond  you cut the glowing, yellow buildings in two, breaks the walls into uneven halves; you looks at the breaths seeping from those small empty houses  pounding pianos, children's cries, head banging against the only landscape that was able to make him feel.  you wonders at your skull shaped like an ego, if it will ever break every day you shove back your black tar from your concrete and then one day plant loads of dynamite (i never was enough for you)  observe the clouds and what is hanging in them: globes, penal codes, dead cats and locomotives	  they turn in the skins of white clouds like trash in a puddle. while below on the earth a banner, the color of a romantic rose,	flutters,  and a long row of trains crawls on the weed-covered tracks.
