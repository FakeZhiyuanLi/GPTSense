WHY DOES MY LIFE HAVE TO SUCK??? plus everyone in my family says im gothic... and acording to my aunt gothic people are satin worshipers... I DONT WORSHIP FUCKIN SATEN! I DONT GUIVE A SHIT ABOUT SATIN OTHER THEN THE FACT HE KEEPS FUCKIN UP MY MUTHER FUCKIN LIFE! damn! sorry... girlly moment i guess... im just so tired of bein alone and not having anyone who really cares about me... is that so hard to understand? why cant i find someone? i know im not the prettiest bitch in the whole fuckin  world but damn... i think part of it is my school... its full of fuckin PREPS and i cant stand them and its only got a couple of people i can stand that arnt fuckin preps or liers or back stabbers! if there is a god he must really not give a shit about me to let my life be this horriable. HE COULD FIX IT IF HE REALLY WANTED TO! he wont do anyrthing for me... i cant even be happy or feel good about myself cuz everytime i start to get happy and feel better something always has to fuckin happen.! im so ahhhhhh!!!! SOMEONE! ANYONE! CHEER ME UP PLEASE! i cant take anything bad happening anymore! lata!                                                             ^v^ Mary   ^v^

      ok well this is my first post and im like bored out of my mind.... my summer sux ass cuz everyone i no has got to do at least one thing fun this summer and all i got to do was go to ohio twice for my dads court hearing and trust me NO FUN WAS HAD! lol i was suposed to go to the incubus concert with my friend Ciara but she went to Oregon so i didnt get to go. to me life just kinda sux ass. i have been really unhappy for a long time. i dont know how to get happy again. i guess im gothic but i dont really label myself. its just what people wanna call me becuz i wear all black and i dont like very many people.i dont care what they say thou cuz all i care about is me and my few close friends. theres this song by ashlee simpson i REALLY like. it just i dunno how to explain... anyways the lyric goes theres a million reasons why i cry... hold my covers tight and close my eyes... cuz i dont wanna be alone... and thats how i feel. the only problem is guys dont like me and i am just bumed all the time cuz i always feel so alone.mabe someday i'll find someone but right now i guess im goin solo! (i cant spell)
