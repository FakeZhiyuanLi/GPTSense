       *DROOLING*  Holy hell... I might be a little slow but I just saw rockstar released GTA San Andreas screenshots. Only three but check'em out!    urlLink GTA San Andreas   Below is a easimated plot~   11:44 Who is Carl Johnson? Is he the guy on the BMX in the first set of GTA: San Andreas screens released yesterday? Or the guy posing in front of his open top low-rider? Whoever he is, he's in trouble. Five years ago Carl escaped the urban hellhole of Los Santos, San Andreas - a city packed to the rafters with Hollywood hustlers, reclusive millionaires and dirty dealers. But now, Carl's mum has been murdered and, as he returns home to try and hold his family together, he's framed by a couple of bent cops.  San Andreas is set to be a far larger game than either GTA 3 or Vice City, since SA is actually an entire state. We've heard about three cities so far - the aforementioned Los Santos as well as San Fierro and Las Venturra, and there will be open countryside between each one!  Lead character Carl has a family, too, so we could be looking at a much more intricate plot as he struggles to save them and clear his name. Building interiors are now much more detailed, and you can commit burglaries as well as gamble your hard stolen cash away in casinos. A new stamina meter means you need to stop off for junk food every now and again to keep your energy up, plus you'll be able to recruit your own gang as back-up.  Add to that a classic early 90s West Coast setting (musically, think G-funk, grunge, the classic years for Detroit techno) and we could be looking at another potential Rockstar classic. GTA: San Andreas is due for release in the UK on October 22nd.

       Hmm the following may gross out some people out there so reader discretion is advised.    10 minutes ago it felt like my brain dribble out of my nose. Yes I said my brain poured out of my nose. :D I feel funny!

       Today was a half day at my school, and my aunt was coming down for a dentist appointment. So she wanted to drop me off at school, it was all rather boring/normal. Then we went to the local SMMC later that day to get my grandma's meds and that's when the bitching begins! My aunt decided to go to the pharmacy herself and my grandma and I went to eat something, you know a normal microwave "giant flame broiler hamburger", which tasted like tofu. So we got bored around 20 after 12 and went upstairs to the pharmacy and my aunt was going nuts, I really don't know why as it wasn't her medication. But she was super pissed because they had sent her upstairs to the cashier and charged her 280$, and because it was a lunch break by then she went back down to pick up the meds and the pharmacy was closed. But I don't think I've mentioned she's totally moronic (stupid). So she was hitting the big steel door and closed up Plexiglas window, and an employee asked he what she wanted and my aunt just gave her the big middle finger. We were both embarrassed (grandma and me) and said sorry for what our idiot relative had done and went on our way. Then she went to the clinic and was bitching there too. The funny thing about all this is that it's a Catholic hospital... But then at 1:11 an old guy opened up the place and she gave him the finger and he said I really don't want to argue "mah'm" and she said shove it up your ass. But she did get the medication if you were wondering. That's basically it for the beginning of the day.

       Its a Thursday night, about 10 o'clock. And I have nothing to do, yup just my boring self sitting in my chair in shunting boredom. Kinda sad since this is my rather limited life besides going to school and hanging with some of my friends. But between those times I have quite crazy moments. Now ill see you all later.

       Yeah i a making a new site cause i feel like B3GZE3 sucked and really wasn't fun at all. So hopefully i can put a little more of myself into this new one. And also theres no grey in the layout. Today i twisted a guys leg over two desks because he stepped in my bookbag. It's really kind of funny how a normal day can end out to be crazy to someone else.

         Ahhh what a good day, one of my most hated enemies has suspended today because he and his friends snuck into the girls' bedroom and did who knows what ;-). But also the girls were suspended for letting them in. But the reason I didn't update on Sun. Was because I was hanging at my cousin's house helping him beat Halo.
