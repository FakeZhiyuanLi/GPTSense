      This telemarketing thing is going really well for me. The deal is you make 50 bucks for every 5 deals you make, as commission, then another 50 bucks as bonus for every 20 deals you make in a week. Thus, since I started working my 5 hours a day, 6 days a week, I have made 300 bones extra. So, with the math, that comes out to $780 for 50 hours of work. (comes out to $15.80/hr.) not bad, i know, for a shitty telemarketing job. okay enough showing off my hot job.  yay the parents are gone! they left this morning early, so i wasn't up to say bye. norm's coming over tonight and we're going to the drive-in. i havn't yet been, i'm excited. I think we'll have sex for the first time together tonight.  we'll see. apparently the drive-in goes till like 1:30 am or something, so maybe we'll be to tired to do anything anyway....is this blog getting to personal? do people really care about my sex life?  There's this guy I work with named Kelphon. He's really cute/obnoxious. Cute probably isn't the best way to describe him. He's very similar to me in that he's a pure social butterfly. I wonder if Norm wasn't around, I'd be interested in him. I know I would. I got him to open up to me yesturday. We discussed who he 'liked' ( I know, that's such an adolescent term) and other follies about sex/love. He's got different taste in music than me. That is one thing that I know doesn't seem that important in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, but I can't stand a guy who listens to only rap/hip-hop. I'm not saying that I don't listen to that stuff myself, but I really don't that often. Brad listened to that music all the time, and I couldn't stand it. Joel didn't, me and JOel had similar tastes in music actually. Now me and Norm do as well.  Being a preppy rich bitch, people don't expect me to listen to classic rock. My favourite song of all time is Goodbye Stranger by Supertramp. Everyone has a song that when it comes on, your body just comes alive with joy. That song does that for me. Classic rock isn't all I listen to though. A generic get-to-know-you question is "what kind of music do you listen to?" A generic answer is, "a bit of everything." I can honestly say that that is the only answer I could really produce for that question, excluding heavy metal and most hard-core country. Beyonce, Billy Talent, Dave Matthews, Vonda Sheppard, Nora Jones, Led Zepplin, Fiona Apple, the Trews are all favourites, plus random oldies from the 70s and 80s.   John Kerry's  speech last night was terrific. Being a preppy rich bitch/occasionally mistaken for a ditz, people are suprised at how knowledgable and interested I am in politics, particularly American politics. I can't help it, I find it incredibly fascinating and oddly entertaining at the same time. Sure, Canada's had it's share of quality humourous polititians ie, the poor  Stockwell Day , the Jowl-ed  Joe Clark  or the Caricature-looking  Brian Molrouney .   BUT nothing compares to  Bush . I mean common, the guy's a walking, talking joke.  If he wins the election I, along with the majority of sane Canadians will be devastated.  Is anyone actually reading these posts? or am I just talking to myself?

      In recent conversations (history class) the over-done debate of whether or not homosexuality is right or wrong, and the whole gay-marriage dispute has been made. Although I try to respect other people's opinions on issues like these, this is one instance where I come so close to saying, "NO! Your opinion is wrong!" I don't hold people's opinions on issues against them (at least, I try not to), but what I really want to say to them is,&nbsp; "Common grandpa, get with the times." Sure, it says in the  Bible  to marry the opposite sex or whatever, and being a Christian, I do believe what the  Bible  says, but, you have to look at what the  Bible  says in context, and remember that it was written about a zillion years ago. So, don't take this blog too seriously, I'm trying not to.  These days, the fabulousness of the gays is hard to contain. At no other time in the history of humanity have gay rights been the focus of so much attention in the media. You'd think this would happen sooner, given the popularity of musical theatre. There has been so much accomplishment in terms of achieving equality for gay people around the world. Gay people can now be free of discrimination, free of prejudice in hair salons around the country. People finally understand the fear, the terror gays/lesbians face when confronted with enlarged pores. Many gay people compare this fight for equal rights and non-discrimination to that of African-Americans.   However, members of the African-American community have not taken this comparison kindly. Someone said, "The experience is not the same." I take this to mean that the discrimination that gays face is not the same as that of African-Americans primarily (as it was claimed) because gay people can "choose" not to be gay. I don't know what it is like to be black, or gay, but this I picked up somewhere: In 1998, when Matthew Shephard confided to two men that he was gay, they deceived him into leaving with them in their car. He was robbed, brutally beaten, tied to a fence and left for dead. He died several days later.  &nbsp;If it were a choice, I think all these hundreds and thousands of people would have chosen not to suffer, face hardship, lose friends and family, their jobs and their lives. In my opinion, if gays/lesbians compare themselves with African-Americans, it's probably only because they've seen what they have achieved and that's what they want for themselves.  But that's only my opinion, it could be wrong.

       Am I in love? Me and Norm have only been "officially exclusive" for a week. Is there&nbsp;a scientific equation for love? Nah, I don't think so. It would be so much easier if I lived on my own. I'm only 17. Thankfully mom and dad and&nbsp;brother left last friday for the weekend, so norm came over on Fri night, we rented  Eurotrip.  I wished he could've slept over, but I forgot to ask him, so it wasn't arranged. So instead we just fooled around, he ate me out, i gave him head. We havn't had sex yet. I think this weekend it'll happen. Mom, Dad and brother are going to Montreal for a week for vacation. I can't go because of my stupid job.     &nbsp;  Norm has no post-secondary education. He makes $400 a day as an electrician with Hydro1, but still, no education? "Preposterous," says Dad. "Absolutely outlandish!" says Mom. I don't really care, as long as he doesn't get all pissy when I dump him for some fancy shmancy pre-med student, whom I will inevitably marry.     &nbsp;  I'm 17. I have had sex twice, with two different people. Is that slutty?    &nbsp;  From the outside I have the perfect life.&nbsp; I&nbsp;excelled in school, was&nbsp;very extra-curricularily involved, have professional parents, both of whom have treated&nbsp;eachother and me&nbsp;with nothing but love and respect, and volunteer at 3 different places. My friend's throught the years have always bugged me that I have a picture-perfect family, I think it's got it's problems, but is probably about as close as you can get....so why am I so different?     &nbsp;  Of course, no one understands the way I think. Because I keep it in my head. I recently got a job as a telemarketer for a large firm. On the second day of the job I was the top seller. Now, a week into the job, I have been promoted. Why? because from the moment a conversation i open with someone, i conform to whatever they want me to be. Thats why everyone likes me. I feel like i have no identity. I have taught myself how to be someone else so well that I've lost who I truely am.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;Am I what is known as a "closet slut?" 2 months ago I got my right nipple pierced. I figured it's edgy enough for the guys to go wild, but not as&nbsp;everlasting as a tattoo.    P.S. My english teacher would go nuts, this entry defies everything I have learned in 4 years of University level high school english.

      Norm's leaving for Luke's cottage tonight. I'm really going to miss him. Last night he came over. This is putting me into a bad mood. I miss him already.  Tonight is Joel's party. I wonder how big it's goign to get. Me and Sarah Milne are going together. I'm picking her up at the Keg after work. Brad'll probably be there, I wonder if we'll talk at all, or if I'll confront him or whatever. It'll be interesting to see how the evening pans out.  Today me, Danielle, Melissa and Leigh were all talking on msn. I wonder what the hell is going on with Danielle. I swear she's like depressed or something. I have just about had it with her though, I don't really care anymore what her problem is.  omg I miss Norm. It hasn't even been 24 hours since I've seen him.  I wonder when I'll see him when school comes. It'll be wierd because I'm not usually supposed to go out on school nights, but when else will I see him? Other than weekends I guess, I don't really want to think about it. Ah, I wish it was this time last week. I was so happy, I had 9 days parent-free, with Norm. I'll miss him a lot.  Okay enough sap, I've got to get ready for work anyway. Later
