      Great,  Today I know the feeling of being an idiot.  First, I must provide some background story.  I have spent the last two days farming Beehive Chips and Silk Thread in East Sarutabaruta (damn, wish I had the auto-translator here).  Somehow, I have been able to amass 9 stacks of beehive chips and 3 stacks of silk thread.  Ok, so in the Windurst AH (Auction House), chips sells for, roughly, 4k/stack and silk thread sells for 12k/stack.    OK, now for my idiocy.  I was enraged that some fools were undercutting the price of silk thread and selling for only 10k.  So, my plan was to buy all the threads for 10k and turn around and sell them for 12k.  Well, instead of buying silk threads at 10k/stack, I buy 5 stacks of chips at 10k/stack before I realize my error. */cry*  OMFG, WTF did I just do!!!  5 X 10k = 50k (ouch).  I figure I can sell the chips back @ 4k/stack 5 X 4k = 20k.  So..... 50k - 20k = 30k (net loss, again ouch).  So I decide to contact the sellers.  A tell sent to each of them asking if they would be willing to return my funds (only asked for 5k back to be generous).  5 tells sent.  0 responses received. ARGH.  Oh well, I'll keep sending tells until I receive a response.   UPDATED @ 09:19 -- One of the people, Rafflesia, returned my gil.  Kudos to awesome people like this that play FFXI   Signing out for now,  Kalice

      OK,   I'm dedicating this weblog to my partners in crime Ferran (Ben) and Krazysmurf (Sam) who are in Alaska for the summer fishing.  This weblog is going to detail my adventures in Final Fantasy XI while they are Alaska and unable to play the game.  This should provide them with some entertainment, I hope. ^^  Cheers,  Kalice (Ryan)

      Being a ninja is expensive....Did I mention that it was expensive.... Damn, 5-6k for a stack of shehei, plus the other ninja tools and I'm just about outfitted for level 19.  But anyway, back to the subject --farming--.  I've been venturing into the Horutoto Ruins and killing goblin thugs and bats for onions and wings which seem to sell fairly quickly and fairly well.  4.5k/stack for onions and 2k/stack of wings.  I haven't done much leveling yet because I'm trying to put together enough cash to fund my ninja tool habit into my 30's.  We'll see how bored I get of farming before then.  Anyway, that's my story for the day.  I'll try to get some stupid noob stories in the coming weeks.
