      i know, i need to be getting sleep; i know, i have exams; i know, i should be studing; i know, i said that i wouldn't post; but i have to get this out there.  Michelle vs. Lindsey Michelle: pros. local, nice, pretty, might like me, fun, similar intrests; cons. dont know if she likes me, lives in a different town(closer than Lindsey, still to far to easily commute), pretty shy, known for a long time. Lindsey: pros. nice, hot, know she likes me, similar intrests, open, responds to emails; cons. has a boyfriend, lives in houston, really dont get to see her much... i think thats it  ok, so i need help, all of you, i need to know what to do, should i try somthing with Michelle(again/still) and risk our friendship, or should i hold out and try to be with Lindsey.  she wont even kiss me if i have a girlfriend, cause its bad enough to her boyfriend, and it would be so much worse if we both had someone else.  i am at a huge loss for ideas here and i dont know why this came to mind, but i want your advice.  post a comment on Bloggers new posting system, this will probably be up for a while so a lot of you can read it.  im sleeping now so i can do my exams tomorrow, ok then, night, bed bugs, stuff, bye

      ok, so Tell asks for not much to happen to me until she can read again, well i did the next best thing, not post.  well, even you still cant read it the rest of the people want to know so, here goes:  i got my learners permit to drive right, so i have went out this afternoon and did a lot of turns in a parking lot behind the middle school near by.  i did alright i think, but my dad didnt like how well i did.  umm... earlier this week... nothing much really... so yeah, pretty boring.  guess i'll report on constants: Nothing between me and Michelle; Finals are going to be a bitch; OKC rally still in the air, well not still again.  Michelle has a plan on what to do, and if she works it out, then i want to go as well, but we will see.  umm.... band is sucking, we have a concert next tuesday, and we are doing to much stuff, my face is going to get so out of shape this summer.... we dont have a summer thing cause we dont have a marching band caues we are to lame.  i would so like to try and set somthing deffinate with Michelle at church tomorrow, like a real date where we can meet and go out, but go out on a date... i think that was the sencario..... so long ago, i dont remember.  well, sleep now, so im just gonna stop typing and go and sleep because i have to get up early tomorrow to go to a breakfast meeting with our intern minister to dicuss her expections for the credo service, it would probably help if i were to stop typing......... maybe, ok, bed bugs, bye... no for real, im stoping..... i am, there is nothing left to read, im stoping....... fine keep reading, see if i care!  i do, please always read my blog.

      ok, been a while, and quite a bit to recap, here goes:  Wendsday i realized that three things were happening on the same weekend, on the 28-30, i have a rally, school graduation, and a service my church class is putting on for the adults.  ok, so i talk to my friend that would be graduating and he says to go to the rally and have fun for him there.  i send an email to my class advisior and she tells me that she would rather i didnt go to the rally, and i get an email from the head minister at my church saying both that he was disipointed in our youth service that we all thought was good, and he told me that i should choose either the rally or the service, i sent him a response both justifying our youth service and telling him that if i was forced to choose i would pick the service, but didnt like the postion he was putting me in.  well, this weekend wasnt all bad, i had a hilarious convo with Dustin, he seems to be in all the convos i put here, o well, its very funny, and captures me perfectly  I play tuba07: f'n loozer Elf0004: what? I play tuba07: fuckin loozer I play tuba07: cant spejl I play tuba07: spel I play tuba07: spell! I play tuba07: DAMN Elf0004: HAHA I play tuba07: lmao!  yeah, see, he also told me its not "i cant speel", but indtead "i kant sphel", so there you have it, now im gonna sleep, night to you all, bed bugs, and stuff, bye

      Ugg, in school, after health test and I’m using my computer under the guise of doing my English Paper, im done with it though, I hope I pass... ok so full weekend thing! Saturday at one-ish, Mr. Yard picked me up and we went to the rehearsal and when we got there only Jerika, Alan, and Sara were there yet, and so I was talking with Jerika and she told me that she had gone on a blind double date with Jenny, Jenny’s boyfriend, and she went with a friend of Jenny’s boyfriend, now apparently this friend that she went with looked a lot like me, and she thought that was better than if he looked like no one... I would rather not recognize the person, because if I do, then I would have an expectant set of behaviors that I would think they would do, but that’s just me... ok so we started and all the mics go set and the blue man did practicing for an eternity, well, less of an eternity and more of an hour, until they were ready, there parts were the ones that needed the most preparation.  After we did a run thought with the people that we had present, which was all but Michelle, Chreyl, and Niki, the blue men kept doing there thing until it was time to leave.  Then I went home, did some stuff that I don’t remember, then I talked to Jesse and I went over to his house so that I wouldn’t have to disturb the house when I woke up at seven.  We stayed up till midnight watching South Park, and eating pizza, and playing computer games (I leveled my character on Galaxies!w00t!) Then we went to sleep.  We woke up the next morning Jesse took a shower and I spelt till 6:30, at which point I was woken with “you need to get up now, try splashing water on your face, or rubbing acid in your eyes, that might help.”  Mr. Snider is so much cooler than my parents.  We let at seven-ish and Sara was there waiting for us, I set up the mics and the Blue Men people got make-up put on.  Were ready early so we just hung out for a while.  Once it started it was great, AJ and Sara and Jesse had there stuff down and the flying off drumstick was great, not planed but we knew what to do for it and it was awesome.  My call to worship went of well, I asked them how many of them thought I needed a hair cut (I don’t by the way) and less than half raised there hands, but my dad doesn’t accept it as a very scientific survey, he just didn’t like the answer.  The sermonettes were goo and thoughtful, I thought it went well.  In the question portion we had all the ones we expected and then some other ones that we handled well I think.  I cant really remember the ones from the first service but I’ll talk about the ones form the second one when we get there.  We had the in between wear we decided some of the things we needed to refine for the next one, then we did the next one.  It was really the same except the first was better as far as the blue man things went, the stick didn’t come off in the second service so it wasn’t as much fun.  The questions were good, someone asked us what we had to do with ours lives for us to consider them successful when we were adults, some one said that we were happy, then the point was brought up that if you completed all our goals, but some one said that Hitler completed his goals, but would we thing his life successful? Probably not, so it was interesting... then after the services were over we broke down, loaded the blue equipment, took down the mics all that stuff that needed doing, then sense I was going home with Jesse, and Jesse had a friend of his from the Blue Man Forums that came to see the service, we went out to eat and Bennigins, it was so much fun, our waitress had a distinct resemblance and sounded a lot like Drew Barrymore, it was cool.  She gave Jesse’s mom an extra side cause she wanted her to try it cause she thought it tasted so good.  When we were done with the food we were passing it across the table so she could take it and Mr. Snider took the pickle off of my plate and put it on his, when she came back later to ask if we needed any takeout boxes he asked for a one for his pickle, she brought him a full size one, it was funny.   She came to us to ask for deserts and told us we needed to try this one new thing no one was ordering and Jesse’s friend from the forums said that she would get this one thing but she couldn’t eat it all, the waitress said that little kids eat those for their birthdays, randomly Mr. Snider was like “it is her birthday” she knew we were kidding but she ended up not charging us for the dessert anyway, like I said she was cool.  She kept bugging us about getting deserts, and then I was all, well we cant see the menu so we don’t know what you have, I looked in it and ordered something other than what she was pressuring us to get and she was like, “you don’t even order what I recommend!” and I said fine I’ll have the other one and Mr. Snider said “you must be hell on a date” and we all laughed.  The dessert was really good and even thought she gave us six spoons I ate most of it myself.  After that we were leaving and she told us to go and enjoy the afternoon for her cause she was stuck inside.  We went to Jesse’s house then I biked home, and argued with Alex about the lawn and his not coming to the service (we ended up doing it yesterday, the lawn that is) and then I worked on my English project... nothing else has happened today but it still might.  Its only the end of advisory, well I need to get to class now, if anything else happens I will be included, bye.

      ok, so long ass, full of stuff, highly entertaining, weekend..... im gonna get a cramp... here goes, the reashral: so i get there and like even though we are a little early and the only people there are Grant and Jerika, o yeah, Alan and Sara were in the back, but anyway, i start talking to Jerika and she tells me that she went on a blind double date with one of Jenny's b/fs friends, and apperently he had an uncanny resemblace to me, which she thought was better than if he looked like someone she didnt know, i would personaly rather that a blind date not remind me of a friend, but thats just me... ok so the reashral went fairly well, i wont bore you with anymore mundane detail about stuff sense this post is gonna be long enough anyway, but i spent a lot of time in the sound room with Jerika and Jenny writing the mic script and partly just hanging out.  next the services: well, and the intermintint time, i went to Jesse's house so i didnt have to wake up my family at an isane hour, and it was fun cause we watched South Park, and had pizza, and i played Galaxies, it was all good.  then in the morning Jesse's dad told me to wake up he said i could try "splashing water on my face, or rubbing acid in my eyes, either works" i didnt end up doing either, i just grabed a kinda stale slice of pizza and was ready to go, but we didnt leave for a while, when we got there Sara already waiting for us and they went into makeup and i set up the mics and other stuff that needed doing.  they were blue and it was the awsome.   once it started the drumbone opening went off without a hitch, much coolness.  and then the hymns were good, the semonettes were fine, the call to worship that i did was alright, i had some fun doing it, i might tell about it tomorrow when im not rushed for bed and posts.  but the part i will tell later is the part about the questions from the adults, both services it was really a lot of fun.  RUBBER CHIKEN!!11oneone!! hehe, yeah....  ok but the second service wasnt as good because Jerika didnt sing the offeretory cause Dani was being posseive about it for the second one, go figure... ok but then after the allness (i promise more comprehinsive is to come, just not this late.) we (being me, and Jesse's family, and his friend from the Blue Man forums Chad Wina(maybe spelled wrong))  went out to Bennigings and had the awsomest lunch, our waiter was so cool, but you more at the later... then after lunch i came home and did my english paper, argued with Alex about doing the lawn, then watched The Simpsons, then ate, then did French Review, then this then sleep.  Alex is pushing for my company so ill go now, i will give you more detail later cause i know you are all so interested, after the lawn tomorrow i promise to try, or at night, whichever i cant do... later, night, bed bugs, bye

      ok, so it started on the fourth, when I boarded a plane to Massachusetts after a painfully long flight, I arrived and was picked up by my Aunt Dody. We had dinner and then watched LotR:TT. And part way through, got tired and went to sleep. The next morning I slept really late, like till 12:30, from like 10ish at night, so that was fun. After that we were leaving for my Uncle Ralph’s new place; when we walked out the door there was this group of kids causing trouble in the street outside of one of Dody’s neighbors houses, and we were gonna wait until they had left to leave, cause my aunt is so consciences like that, and as the group of them drifted off and dwindled to three, she kept telling the rest of them to leave, but this one girl kept putting on this drama queen act where she pretended to be so upset and distressed, and she eventually hit the lady and my aunt ran into the street with her cellphone calling the police, we followed the kids in her car until they went down onto the railroad tracks, and disappeared. After that ordeal we went to Ralph’s and took a walk waiting for him to show up, then I played with my cousins and had dinner then we rented Master and Commander watched it, a good movie, even the second time around. The next day, would have been Sunday, we went to a British car show and it was cool, we took a walk on the beach, I got some cool-ish shots with my awesome new camera, and then we went back to his place, dropped off the cousins at their mothers, and we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, it sucked majorly, but I don’t want to talk about it. On Monday I went to work with Ralph for half the day, then I went with my second cousin and his grandmother, we went to a place to play put-put-golf at a place called “puts-up-dock”, you may laugh at its corniness now. Ok enough of that. But the place was closed, and we went to lunch instead, at a place called Ruby Tuesdays, I had a cheese burger and a chocolate tall cake which I couldn’t finish, its was really big. Then I met up with Dody, and we had dinner at a friend of hers, and it was fun. Then another friend of hers was staying over at her place in order to look for jobs in the area, and I had an interesting discussion with her, I can’t remember about what, but it was interesting. And then it was Tuesday and I left for work with Dody because that’s where Gary was to pick me up, so I hung out around Harvard Square for the day, had lunch with Dody and two of her friends who are about my age that I had met when I had gone up there before, and afterwards, I met up with Gary, we checked our bags in a hotel of the same chain of the one we were staying at in a suburb of Boston. We went out to some square in Boston and gad dinner at some place, I don’t remember where though, sorry, and after doing some other stuff, we got on the T and caught a ride to the end, and got cabs to our hotel and we went to sleep. Wednesday was kinda the first actual day of the trip with the group. We got up early and went to the UUA headquarters at 25 Beacon St. and took a tour of the place, it was really cool and I got some buttons out of the deal. After that we walked along the freedom trail for a while, and I was deeply impacted by the Holocaust monument that we went to, then we were to first group in all of the COA trips history that everyone had a raw oyster in, I personally had four. And to close the best day of the trip, we went to the blue man show. ITS WAS TOTAL FUCKING AWESOMENESS!!! I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn’t really lame. Possibly a review of it on Pie and Video games later, if Jesse wouldn’t be two offended by giving stuff away in a review, we shall see though. I bought the Rock Concert DVD, and the AUDIO CD, and got free band mints with my thirty dollar purchase, much coolness. And Dustin bought the spin painting, and also got mints, which is much cool-ness. thursday was fun, we went out to Walden pond and got baptized in one of the UU principles, i chose: "a free and responsible search for truth and meaning." i like that one the best. we also walked around in the rain, and then we went bowling, candlepin bowling, and Micelle got the most improved award, which is a thumbs up, or was it just the right to say that, i dont remember... and that was that day, i think, im gonna take a break now, and finish later. will update later.  Ok, its later.  So where did I leave off?  o yes, Walden, I realized that I forgot what happened in the interim, we went to this place, the something or other farms, and we had lunch, and then did some put-put, and I got the most improved score, cause I sucked majorly in the first round.  Ok then after that we ordered ice cream, and I was one of the only people who finished theirs, cause they were really large servings, and we also played some hackysack, and I really need to get better at that cause I kinda suck at it. Alright, then on Friday we went to tour the Arlington St Church, and it was really cool cause he liked our group and took us up too the bell tower, so that was really nice of him, cause he isn’t supposed to do that anymore.  Yeah, well then we had time to go off on our own, so we left each other in the Boston Commons and the groups split into their norms(Kara, Kaylin, Dustin, and Anthony and Michelle, Katie, Sean, and myself) the groups all had cell phones and everyone’s numbers so we were all fine.  It started off with us just walking around, and my group went to Faunal Hall area to eat, and from there we went to the Borders books that we understand was the “base of operations” for last years group, that we had been to before, and some of us bought some stuff, and others had already purchased things.  I called the other group, and they came to meet us at the Borders, and then we left, and Katie didn’t want to spend a day with Kara so we left them in front of us and Kaylin was running through traffic, and we all laughed at her but she eventually left with the rest of her group.  We then headed to the CVS to pick up some munchies for the night(you see, we did late night staying up, truth or dare, then fingers, and other get to know each other stuff like that, and we of course got hungry, so we got some food for that) and as we were walking out a weird lady came up to us and gave us a flower and told us she was getting money for orphans, and we gave her our change form the munchies, walked off, and then realized that we had been scammed.  We went back and lied that we needed the money for out T ride home, and some of the money was returned to us.  Then we went down to the last stop on the blue line “wonderland” cause Gary had been saying that there was something special about it, and we called him and asked what there was to do there, and he told us nothing.  Then we went back and called the other group who was apparently lost at Faunal Hall so we went to meet them and hung out for the rest of the day at the commons, after I used my l33t map skillz to find out where we were (and so no one gets to kick me in the balls, cause I said that if I couldn’t find our way to the park, and I did so no one gets to kick me in the balls, especially not Dustin!)  Ok so that was a really long day and the next was just as long seeming. You see on the Saturday we went to Harvard Square, which was a load of fun, we did a “scavenger hunt” to begin with and the team I was on (Michelle, Anthony, Kaylin, and me) got every single question right, cause we are just that awesome, and pathetic!!!!1 then we met up and took pictures of the statue, and then I went with Kara and Kaylin shopping cause I needed to be with some one to shop, and I really wanted to get the FFX lighter, and I did and I owe Dustin $20, but it was so worth it and its all mine, and its really cool!  Then we split into two groups, Gary leading Michelle, Katie, and myself and the rest of them in another.  My group went and toured the North end, and that was cool, and they went down by the shore to lounge around and we met up with them and played hackysac or a while and then we did some extreme frisbee, and my team won both times, so that was fun.  Kara picked up a guy and they “went for a walk” and disappeared for a while, im not sure what they really did and I don’t know if I want to know.  Yeah, then we went on a sunset cruise and chilled for a while, more hackysac was played, as well as cards, I did both a for a little, but what I like most about he trip was that I got some good pictures even if the subjects didn’t know they were being photographed.  But they really did look good.  We went out to Legal Seafood, I had some scallops, and we had some great conversations as well as a symphony of water glasses, if I you know what I mean, and if you don’t, then get out more.  So that night I was really freaking out at the T stop, I’m not sure why, but it happens every so often, and Shanna mad me go in the first cab, and then I walked around the open space in the middle for a while, then I went back, I was in the girls room for a while, until the rest of the folks came in and then I left cause it was getting to me too much.  I went to bed , but I wasn’t able to sleep and eventually got up just in time to vomit.  After that I really didn’t feel like sleeping especially caused my face felt all stretched out, and my capillaries were busted.  I woke up Katie and asked if people were still in there, and as it turns out they had moved and so I went to the other room, and then after about another half hour of watching TV, I threw up again in their sink, then I went to sleep again, and I did sleep, so it was all good. The next morning, we went to the service at the ASC(the church we toured earlier) and then we left again on the trip from Boston, and I ended up in VA, and they went back to Dallas. And now its all good and up to date, hope you enjoyed this, and per Jesse’s request I will do a “review” of he blueman show, but it may be more like a narrative, I don’t know.  But im gonna try and force my bro of the comp soon so that I can post this and talk with people, so bye, night, bed bugs, stuff, and all of that jazz... yeah, thats it so bye

      The things that irritate me are far and few between, Nicholas. However, when I DO find something that makes me frustrated, you seem to dismiss it thinking it should go straight into my personal blog. This in itself makes me angry, and I rarely get mad. If the blog is here for our thoughts and feelings, then I will use it to any extent I wish. Unless you and Jesse veto my update. Then I will get rid of it.  Two things. 1. Its raining, so therefore I am happy 2. Some guy came into our school and we had to go into lock-down mode! It rawkd!  END!!!!

      At first, me being who I am, I was outraged that Nicholas would DARE to defy my word, but then came to realize he is completely right. But please excuse me if I feel like informing you on weird or out-of-the-ordinary things I do on a daily basis. And from now on, you can kiss my ass if you don't like my post. That said, I now move on to my next subject. --- As I now have a job, it is difficult to have a social life on weekends. For instance, this Saturday Jesse is having a Blue Man party, but I have work until 9:00pm. This also intervenes on my band practice. Point being, my weekends are fucked, and that pisses me off. --- This school year is now coming to a close, leaving me to ponder some things. One thought I had today is "Why are there so many non-band members joining the flag corps?". Scary, isn't it? It really gives me a reason o call them flaggots (flag + faggots = flaggots[this name suits them so very, very well]).   I was forced to return my Tuba to Mac today... Rolling a tuba in a tuba case across Macarthur is not an easy task, I might add. It makes you hot n' sweaty!!! --- Boston in two weeks...   *note    whenever I place a '---' that means I have just changed subjects. Just thought I would let the readers know.

      The school year is coming to an end, and in some respects, I wish it wasn't.  I mean, yeah, it's gonna be great that we don't have school or gorilla or homework for a while, but... you always lose touch with people over the summer, you know? Like, those you don't ever have any contact with when you're not in that class with them.  Since it seems to be human nature to not go outside anymore, and since noone lives close to eachother, you can't go and do stuff, unless you plan it over the internet or aim.  Of course, it's also doubtful I'll be able to see any of my friends who happen to be girls over the summer, because I've noticed the bulk of Irving's population's behavior, which entails thinking that everything you say is implying something, then taking that something and stretching it WAY out of proportion, nothing works. You can't say "hey, _______, wanna go see troy?" because everyone would just think you were going on a date, even if you weren't**, and the whole thing would be ruined.  Sure, there's AIM, and I'm grateful for that, but I get tired of reading text sometimes. Even though in truth you're talking to another person, sometimes you just need a voice to hear, so you know... you feel less alone.  I guess I've talked about all I need to for tonight, I hope I can find somewhere to go, or something to do, because I really need it right now.  **especially not with me, if you take one look at me in school or something, you'll probably figure I'm not the kind of guy who gets to go on many dates...

      ok, this is to inform the greater public at large, but apperently Dustin needs this also.  i have creadted this in my limited wisdom and if any of the members disagree feel free to voice it.  The purpose of this site is as a informational posting ground for a number of things: One, the bashing, insulting, or ranting about stupid people affecting our lives(this does not include blatent rascim, sexism, pointless hating, or insuling other members of the blog, and plz keep the monotheists bashing to a minimum, there have enough troubles being wrong with out us telling them all the time).  Two, to inform on matters of video games, for example if anyone ever find any cool sites about games, or important info such as a  real  realse date for Halo2 of Half-Life 2 that would go here.  Three, reviews for games movies or anything else that you want to give your opinion on to the greater public.  Four, discussing the inherent goodness of pie, and the act of making pudding from jello mix.  These are the set purpose of this blog,  IT IS NOT A PERSONAL BLOG  we all have our own blogs to post on and ones such as the one made by Dustin on the twentith belong there.  If anyone would like to make an amendant or a clarification on this mission statement, feel free to do so or to ask about it, this is just me, if Dustin or Jesse want to mess with it, we can talk about it, but the recten post on the twenty-third sparked in my mind that a misunderstanding or purpose existed, i hope this clears it up. ~Elf0004

      i dont understand people. thats a rather broad statement, let me clarify.  people have the strange disillsion that there is a set way to behave, and that not following that patteren of behavior, is "uncool".  The group that most closely follows these charateristics, is the "in crowd".  The people that dont meet their standards of "cool" are outcast and labeled; Goths, Geeks, Nerds, Stoners, and more... but then on top of that, the out casts groups dont like each other either, everyone hates everyone who isnt the same group as them.  They all have names for eachother, and reasons, and excuses, but what they dont have, and dont seem to want is sympathy.  People are every day being insulted and bashed for reasons that they dont really have control over, because they didnt make to sports team they aren't "jocks" and thus are a "looser".  Because they want to make somthing out of there lives and not do poorly  in school, they cant be "in" and are a "nerd".  But what is worse, in my opinion at least, is if they try to chage the person that they are, so that they can fit in with the people who they wan to be.  Because they know so much about computers and stuff, they become "geeks".  But if they try to change them selves, then that is changeing who they are, and doing that will enevitably make them regret who they were, and quite possibly hate themsleves.  There is a term for that addapted by the "goth" and other groups that i feel applies quite well for thoes kinds of people, "conformist". If anyone can offer me some insite in the depths of reason behind this kind of thing, would they plz help me to understand.   oh, and one more thing, can someone explain to me why people think im gay?  apperently its a widely held opinion.. at least among the fucks at my school.  or at least it according to my ex-girlfriend, but shes an idiot, so it doesnt matter that much i guess... night then

ShuChoMouf: and satan laughed so hard his horns turned into jello I play tuba07: *GASP* I play tuba: NOT JELLO ShuChoMouf: and then he cried because jello is an absolute good, therefore satan couldnt eat it I play tuba: u know, i can make pudding out of jello gelatin mix ShuChoMouf: i know, i know ShuChoMouf: i have some gelatin mix I play tuba: only on wednesdays, though ShuChoMouf: i thought it was thursdays!

      I got back from Boston yesterday, and it was pretty cool. For the first 4 days Katie was being mean to me... But then she was suddenly nice on the last full day. That made me so happy...  I was thinking it was going to not be as nearly cool as I thought it was going to be but, DAMN, was I wrong. I like the city! It's cool beans!!! I really   Blue Man... oh my god... so awesome... loved it... cant stop thinking about it! The spin painting they made was cool. Even more-so because i BOUGHT IT. Boo-yah! Just goes to show you that i CAN do something better than Jesse ~Shakes fist in air~. I can see why Jess   ...  Me... Nobody understood it though. Like when they're playing and then the band is supposed to come in, but they dont and they look confused. Nobody got that! I was very offended! Stoopid non-Blue Man fans...  Thats all for now!

      Ok, so I went to see it this afternoon, and I thought it was pretty good, so heresy the review:  the beginning has our hero Peter Parker experiencing a dramatic decline in the quality of his life, in living his double life as Spiderman was sapping away all his time, he was fired from his job, and was flunking in collage, and wasn't even making the rent from his pictures.  At his surprise b-day party we are reacquainted with his friends, the rich kid Harry and his romantic interest Mary-Jane.  The seemingly final straw in his life as Spiderman conflicting with his life as Peter is when he misses the a performance of MJ's play, and she is very upset with him and when is powers begin to fail on him he gives up his life as Spiderman and Peter Parker's life greatly improves.  He does well in school and finally makes it to MJ's play, and everything seems to be going better, except Harry wont let up with his vengeance of killing Spiderman as pay-back for his fathers death.  Once he learns that MJ is getting married, he crumbles again, soon a time comes when he realizes that he must be the friendly-neabiorhood-Spiderman.  It was both an action and a romance, but the sappy stuff was worth it to see Spidy get his ass handed to him by a six-armed villain.  All in all, you should see this movie, but don't stay till the end, there isn't anything special, I waited and found nothing, thanks.

      Okay, so none of us have been updating this lately, and that makes me kinda sad... We need to get back into this, people1!!11!!  --- So I ditched my old band, Fatal Error, because we had nothing going. Our keyboardist didnt have a keyboard, our drummer was a stoner, and my other guitarist moved away. Yeah... doesnt that suck? So now im starting one up with Jesse (my awesome little percussionist), Eric (The not-so-little bassist), Me (Sexiest guitarist on the planet earth), and maybe Matt (another guitar) but he kinda doesnt like me because of the whole "Lesa" ordeal. DAMN YOU WOMEN!!! I had this idea for an instrument for Jesse. So far I call it "The Station" because it's stationary (that means it dont move [or with difficulty]). Its like the Blue Man tubulum, but it will the hitting tube part thing infront of him with two toms on either side. The tubes lead up over his head, and just sit there. It's a good idea! Jesse says so! Damnit! --- I am soon going to be painting my room!!! Joy!!! Im gonna force Jesse to come over, and im gonna TRY to get Blanton to come over to help paint it. Yeah... it's gonna rock1!11!! I want to put a silhoette of my guitar on my wall, and then paint inside the name of the band. That would be neato! --- I just destroyed the whole purpose of this blog by putting in these updates, didnt I? Eh... oh well. If you have a problem with it you can STFU!1!11!!!
