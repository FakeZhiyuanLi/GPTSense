      Having at one time (a long time ago, in a country far, far away) considered attending  urlLink The Master’s College , it seems that I have made it one to their mailing list in perpetuum.  Recently in the mail I received the current edition of “The Master’s Current,” their quarterly (?) newsletter.  The current edition is devoted to “doctrinal fidelity,” and hence includes the current iteration of the doctrinal statement.  Being the insufferable bore that I am, I sat down to read it. Right off the bat (in the first section of the  urlLink Doctrinal Statement ) I found some language that intrigued me:    We teach that the Word of God is an objective, propositional revelation (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 2:13), verbally inspired in every word (2 Timothy 3:16), absolutely inerrant in the original documents, infallible, and God-breathed. We teach the literal, grammatical-historical interpretation of Scripture which affirms the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17).  The words “objective, prepositional revelation” in particular surprised me.  Also note this two points later:  We teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal grammatical-historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (John 7:17; 16:12-15; 1 Corinthians 2:7-15; 1 John 2:20). It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture, recognizing that proper application is binding on all generations. Yet the truth of Scripture stands in judgment of men; never do men stand in judgment of it.  This is a little more blunt.  It did not surprise me that The Master’s College perceive the bible as “objective, prepositional revelation” that is to be approached using the “literal grammatical-historical method;” I knew this already.  What surprised me is that these things, this hermeneutic, made its way into the Doctrinal Statement.   	It seems to me that by codifying ones hermeneutic in one’s doctrinal statement that issue (hermeneutics) leaves the realm of something that can be talked about and enters the realm of that which can only be accepted.  I’m not sure what I think about that.  So here’s the question:  What should the function of a doctrinal statement, and what sorts of things are appropriately codified in it, and what sorts of things should be left out?  To discuss this topic, go here.  Please, this discussion is about doctrinal statements, not about disparaging (or praising) the Master’s College.

       It seems that every week we find some new part of our life that is killing us.  our hair spray bottles, fast food, the food industry in general, oppression of third world countries by american based multi-nationals - the list goes on and on.  The term that comes to mind when I hear about these atrocities is  "structural evil."  A two part question/discussion this week: Are these examples of structural evil, and if so as Christians what is the most appropriate response for us?   My two cents:  It seems to me that as "kingdom people;" that is, people who are embodying the character and righteousness of God, and whose communities are to reflect that character and righteousness, we are to be completely opposed to these acts of inhumanity.  Our opposition should start with non-participation; we will not, by the use of our money, underwrite these actions.  (hmmm.  But as I am using a computer, the components of which were assembled by near slave labor in Asia, am I in fact underwriting the actions of those companies?  Am I to stop using this computer, even as a tool to speak out against oppression?  hmmm.)  We should also speak out with one voice against all forms of oppression.  There. that's my 2c.  Agree?  Disagree? let me know.   urlLink

       urlLink    Well, I'm back.  Instead of the picturesque scene you saw represented below, reality looked more like what you see above.  the weather varied between sprinkling, raining, and snowing (just those three), and the trail had't been maintained in a while.  lots of underbrush grown over the trail, logs to climb over or under, and snow drifts to hide the trail all added up to one soaked christopher by the time I set up my tent (at that point wherever I could find a flat spot big enough).  Chock one up to experience.  there were were two nuggets of wisdom validated on this trip:  Always take a change of clothes to leave in the car for the ride home; and, alway take a roll of (emergency) plastic tape.  The reason for the first one is obvious, the second one was validated this morning when I woke up to six inches of fresh snow that obscured my path the night before.  I would have been bummed if I hadn't marked my trail.  The Lord is good, and there will be other weedends for adventure (like next weekend). &nbsp; urlLink

      [experiencing technical difficulties]  Or, at least I was.  If you've wondered why posts have been lacking lately, it is because I finally chucked my Microsoft CD's out the window.  I am operating on a "brand new" computer:  the same hardware now running  urlLink Fedora Core 2  (formerly Red Hat Linux)  I don't have everything up and running yet (DVD video, TV tuner, some other things aren't configured yet) but I was pleasently suprised just how much worked "out of the box" (iPod, SATA RAID, dual head monitor/dual video cards, etc).  It is looking good and running notably faster than under XP.  Anyhow, I am up and running again.

      According to  urlLink JK Rowling's website , the Half-blood Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort.  We know that Harry is a pure-blood, but if it's not Voldemort, then who?  My money's on Hagrid, who is two half-bloods; giant and wizard.  I know it sounds weird, but it sounds weird enough to make sense in Rowling's world.  Or it may be a new character...  And, oh man, did I just tip my hand as a geek...  Though I only scored 26.4% on the test...

      Ah, yes; Let the madness officially begin:  the Title of the sixth Harry Potter book was released today by J.K. Rowling, though no word yet as to when to expect publication.  I, personally was a late-comer to the Harry Potter madness; but I did read the fifth book (Order of Phoenix) in one sitting on the day it was released, so I guess you could say I have caught the bug.  Oh, by the way the title is "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"  Any speculation on who this "Half Blood Prince" is? urlLink The Next Harry Potter Book

      this has surfaced in my life several times; it surfaced again.  For our mutual edification:   MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. - Thomas Merton   For those who must have a bibliographical reference, here it is:  Merton, Thomas.  Thoughts in Solitude.  New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1958. Pg. 83

Very cool stuff. A couple of other cool feeds:  the   urlLink weather forcast /report customized by you, ;  urlLink the word of the day , and the  urlLink feed for this Blog ; great stuff. also, though I don't use it, there is a news reader plug in for firefox ( urlLink aggreg8 ) as well as for Internet Explorer ( urlLink pluck )

      Ever wonder what the masses are thinking about?  How about the Blogging masses.  Now you can know, thanks to  urlLink blogdex .  This site is like a google news for weblogs.  Blogdex's webcrawler pays attention to what sites weblogs are being linked to, and then posts the most popular sites.  This is a pretty accurate way of "polling" what people are reading/paying attention to, since most blogs  (like this one) use links to provide context for their comments.  Blogdex also has a  urlLink rss feed .

      Today the near miraculous happened, I enrolled for classes this fall at PSU.  Praise be to God (and, by the way Lord, I'm not sure how this is getting payed for yet...).  So, you might ask (actually, you didn't so I asked for you) what am I taking?  PHL324 Intro to Formal Logic ENG490U Rhetoric ENG308U Top:  Literature and the Enviroment ENG340U Medieval Literature  BTW I have declared "Liberal Studies" as my major, which is a short-hand way of saying that I get to take pretty much what I want to take.  And there was much rejoicing.

      okay guys, this is crazy - so crazy in fact that I thought it was a hoax until I started seeing the photographic proof that these people are actually giving away iPods.  So I signed up.  If you want a free one you should sign up too.  But first read  urlLink  this  and make sure to sign up using me as a  urlLink referral   urlLink freeiPods.com   Okay if that wasn't enough you can use the same company to get yerself a free 27" Sony WEGA flatscreen TV  urlLink FreeFlatScreens  again use my  urlLink referral code   The Hitch:  1:  You have to sign up for a free offer (you know how those work - sign up and cancel before they start charging you AND 2:  You have to refer so many people (5-8) who each have to sign up for an offer. Is this a pain?  Yea kinda, but if it means getting a free iPod or TV out of the deal I can live with it.
