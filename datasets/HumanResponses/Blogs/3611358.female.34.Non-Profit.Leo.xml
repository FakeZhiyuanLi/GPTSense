      Friday night, Ian had the first class of the new session of karate (he's currently a 3rd degree orange belt).  During each session, they earn stripes for showing proficiency in forms, kicks, and defensive maneuvers.  Ian got his tape for defense in the first class!  He's never earned a tape that quickly before!  Saturday night, he stayed over at Debbie's house along with the girls.  He had a fabulous time (of course!).  He had wanted to get to Debbies as soon as he woke up Saturday morning.  It was hard for him to wait for the evening.  While Ian and the girls were at Debbie's, Joe, Tam, Sean and I got to go to dinner and then see the new Harry Potter movie.  :-D  It was a great night for all of us!  Sunday we went to the San Diego County Fair (I can't stop myself from calling it the Del Mar Fair though!).  We haven't gone in a few years, but this time it was required.  One of the perks of being an art teacher/volunteer, is that my child's art is automatically chosen for display at the Fair.  I also got to pick the best piece of art in the class for submission to the Fair.  After riding a few rides, and eating a few pounds of fried food, we went to the Kid's Best tent.  The Kid's Best tent is where all of the elementary school art is displayed.  EVERY child gets recognition of some kind, but we were pleased to see that Ian had been given a 1st place award!   He's struggled with art this year, and seeing that sticker on his piece made him so proud. He grinned from ear to ear, and he held his head high.   On a personal note, my other student also received a 1st place award.  :-)  That made me extra proud as well.  On Mondays, I go to Ian's class and assemble the homework folders.  I happened to be there when Ian was given his reading assessment test.  Afterwards, his teacher and I chatted for a bit.  She said that Ian's reading at the 2nd grade level! WOW!  She had to go and get a separate assessment test for him, because he's beyond what she used for the other kids.  She commented that not only is his reading advanced, but his comprehension is exceptional.  She said that many kids can read that well, but not many can really comprehend and apply what they've read.  I laughed, and told her that I couldn't take all the credit for Ian's reading... I think a lot of it is from the video game guides that he's had to read.  ;-)

      Okay, so if you use web based email (e.g. hotmail or yahoo mail) then GMail is the new replacement.  The gut response is "This ROCKS!"    To be more objective, here is what I like about it.  Remember, this is a web based interface written in VERY simple languages.  It uses the same technology as yahoo or hotmail (or amazon for that matter), but it does some very creative and new things.    First is simply how mail is organized: threads vs. folders.  So instead of making folders and sorting mail into them, the email are pulled into threads - so all email sent and received around a title are stacked together by date.  Very slick.  Second is keyboard shortcuts.  Yes, keyboard shortcuts in a web app.  Too cool.  So... If you use web-based mail and I send you an invite, try it out.

      I have taught several people that spiders are a boon to your household not a pest.  Each one has looked for what I pointed out and found them.  I had ants in my bathroom and they disappeared.  I found thousands of them in a spider web behind my toilet.  They also trap mosquitos somehow.

      Earlier this week, the girls showed me a spider that was living in the sleeve of Ian's teddy bear.  They regularly point out spiders to me.  Yesterday I removed a spider sac from one of Ian's books.   The thing about Ian is that he doesn't want me to squish spiders!  ARGH!  He wants me to gently collect them and let them go outside.   This morning I took a shower with a spider.  I'm supposed to go tidy the backyard - but I saw several freaky looking spiders out there! So far today, I've vacuumed 6 spiders - just downstairs!   Although, after vacuuming the little pile of dead bees and mosquito parts that one spider had been feasting on, I guess I shouldn't complain about them.  I think I'd prefer the spiders over bees and mosquitos inside my house!  I read an article the other day.  There was a line in it that said, "California has more than 1000 differenct types of spiders.  And they're holding a family reunion at my house."   Nuh-uh.  I think that this year, the reunion's at the Moser's house!  Maybe it's time to have the exterminator spray INSIDE the house, as well as outside.

      I have just discovered Links 2004 for the Xbox. I've become totally addicted. It seems that playing golf really is good stress relief. I have so much I have too worry about right now and work is adding to it. When I get home, I play Links and all my stress is taken out on an imaginary golf ball. All those times I've teased Lawrence about playing golf and here I am playing it on the Xbox. He at least gets out when he plays.

      So who came up with this formula?  I am here is Santa Clara, CA - which is right next to San Jose in NoCal.  It has a ton of large companies here; Brochade, McData, eBay, Teradata, etc.  The thing is, I used to work in Irvine, CA - which is in Orange County in SoCal - and I can't really tell the difference between them.  Other than the fact that there are more pine trees, gray days and people listening to NPR up here, they are exactly the same.    Okay, so it's a Cali thing.  Right?  Nope.  The area north of Pheonix, AZ around Scottsdale along the 101 is much the same.  The same Starbucks, Rubios, juice bar, Old Navy, In-n-Out, Krispy Creme, megaplexed sprawl malls.  Although, there is no confusing the surroundings with Irvine or Santa Clara - and it's juuuuuust a bit hotter in the summer time.    So... who came up with the "instant 'burb" formula?

      Ok, here goes - my first blog entry ever.  What to say... what to say...   Ian's home sick.  Drat.   There goes my chance to spend the day playing Final Fantasy XI.  LOL  Ian's not the only one feeling bad.  I've been having gnarly headaches for over a week.  I hate that I can't figure out what's causing it though.  Could be migraines, sinusitis, a tooth ache... Or spending too much time staring at the tv or monitor playing Final Fantasy XI!  Nah, can't be the last one.  I'll just take some Tylenol and play for a while.  I should feel better soon.  I'm kinda glad that Sean's next two trips were cancelled.  That way we can play FFXI together.  ;-)  Hmmm... I'm seeing a theme in my thoughts.  Karen

      This year I have been to Santa Clara, CA more than 10 times.  In addition to that I have been to Portland twice, Seattle twice, Toronto, Chicago and beautiful Sommerset, NJ.  I also have made a trip to the UK (which was quite nice) and 4 trips to Japan - which I always enjoy, but the flights kill me.  I did get to bring my family on one of the Japan trips, which was great.  Oh, and a trip to Arizona to visit family for my sister's birthday.  So, I just finished packing to go up to Santa Clara again tomorrow.  But, hey... that's where I go to pick up my paycheck, so I am NOT complaining.

      I got a 40 GB iPod from Ian for Father's Day.  Actually, it's from Karen to commemorate our 10th wedding anniversary, but they said it was from Ian for Father's Day.  Sounds good to me.  I am happy either way.    I don't know for sure, but I think I may love this gadget more than any other I have had in my life.  Love the iPod.  Looooove the iPod.

      So... Here is the first blog.  Facinating so far isn't it.  It's sort of weird - now that I have this space to say whatever I want, I find I don't actually have much to say.  Maybe later then.

          So, as I am about to put Hunter down for his nap and Ethan is already down...I am trying to imagine what Sean, Karen, and Ian are doing right now on their well deserved vacation. Well, whatever it is I am sure they are having a great time. Speaking of time, it is time for me to put Hunter down for his nap and get to some cleaning. Back to reality for me!

      Leaving for HI on Saturday.      I find that I am looking at my watch a lot.  I think it's just making it worse.  Would the next couple days go by already!?!  Maybe I can just have a coma induced for today and tomorrow.  Then I could just wake up and get on the plane.  That might be good.    Darn it.  I just looked at my watch again.

      Whew, I'm tired.  There's been so much going on this month that I'm having a hard time keeping track of everything!  Ian is still in school, plus swim classes and karate.  As the school year ends, there are more and more activities going on there.  Of course, I want to participate in as much as possible.  I've been in Ian's class 2-3 days a week!  But it's so rewarding.  Ian appreciates having me around, and the other children are all so wonderful.  I've been spending as much time at my mom's house as I can, doing chores and helping out.  Plus she's in physical therapy twice a week.  The water therapy has been wonderful for her, so it would be awesome if she could continue that even after her prescription ends.  This weekend my Aunt and Uncle are visiting from Detroit.  They bought a house in Las Vegas (heh heh), and will be moving there soon.  Until my uncle retires, they visit their house as much as possible.  This trip, they're also coming out to San Diego.  They were going to stay a little longer, but my uncle's sister-in-law isn't doing well, so they need to drive up to Sacramento on Sunday morning.  Since they'll be in town, Joe and Tam will be having Samantha's family-only birthday gathering on Saturday.  It's short notice, and Sam & Alex are dancing that day - so I'm doing all of the cooking.  That way, Joe and Tam only have to worry about cleaning and the cake.  I'll cook all the rest. YIKES!  I can't believe that Samantha is going to be 8 years old!  She's grown so fast.  What a cool kid she is, too.    Sean will be in Santa Clara next week.  :-(   To top it all off, I'm trying to get rid of a migraine.  It hit me Tuesday... HARD.  I couldn't see, I was throwing up, etc... not to mention the pain.  Thank God Jessica was such an angel.  And luckily Sean was able to come home and watch her & pick up Ian from school so I could sob in our bedroom.  I hate migraines.  At least there's a silver lining - I lost 1.5 pounds that day.  ;-)  In eight days, we'll be in Hawaii.  ~sob sob~  I wish we were already there!  But I need those eight days to do all the last minute shopping, packing and chores.  I keep having this  Star Wars moment... voices in my head are saying, "Stay on target... Stay on target!!" and "Almost there.... alllmooooost there!"

      So, here is something kind of interesting...Mom and I have entered into a kind of race to loose weight. It all started because shortly after having Ethan I started on my diet and exercise routine, I was doing pretty well, but then I got sick and the migraines...blah, blah, blah. Long story short I have packed on the pounds! I have been complaining now for a couple months. Mom came up with this idea a little over a month ago for us to help each other loose weight while racing against each other. For every ten pounds lost the looser has to do something for the winner. For example Mom has told me that if I were to win she would buy me a sundae. Sneaky, huh? ;) I had lost 4 pounds the first three weeks, but I am scared to get on a scale at the moment because I de-railed myself when we took our mini-vacation. I have been slacking on the exercise, late night snacking, and portion sizes...I think that about covers the whole spectrum of weight gain. Oh, well. I just have to get the self control and discipline going. Everyone wish us luck and to the victor goes the... sundaes?

      Dad is moving up to Ukiah on Wednesday (July 14th).  We are going to miss having him close and being able to invite him to "pop on down" for whatever weekend.  I am sure he will have fun though and hope he makes a lot of new friends (and maybe catches up with some old ones).

      Hello Everyone! So, I haven't had too much to write about until now. Here goes... Ian's birthday was on the 7th and he has been dying to go to a water park for weeks now (I haven't and you only get one guess as to why). Ian also thought that we could use a nice little vacation. We had heard about The Pointe at South Mountain Resort on the Travel channel and from family. It was awesome. We only stayed one night, but it was enough. We went early on the 6th, parked our stuff in the room and hit the Oasis, which is the water park at the resort. It has two big speed slides and one curvey one. There is a lazy river, a wave pool with a section around the corner for water volleyball and basketball, and then there is a little 1.5ft deep pool for the little kids with one of those fountains right next to it. I spent a lot of time with the kids at the little pool the second day giving Ian a chance to go down the big slides, I think he did those about ten times each. The boys are a nice golden brown now, you should see the tan lines! We had lunch the first day and breakfast the second day at The Phantom Horse Grill it was very good. The best was dinner at Aunt Chilada's (pun intended)! There is a little pathway through a huge lawn from the hotel to the restaurant and then there is a little bridge over a canal with a sign that says "The little Rio Grande". Very cute and good food. We had a wonderful time and Ian had a really great birthday. Oh, yeah, there were fountains all over the grounds, ranging in size from monstrously huge to little, so Hunter was in heaven.

      Okay... we all know that Sean loooooves the iPod.  Sean also loves iTunes and the iTunes Music Store.  Well, Apple hit a milestone selling their 100 millionth song this last week.  During the run up to 100 million Apple was giving away a 20GB iPod every 100,000 songs - they gave away 50 of those.  Then the guy who ordered the 100 millionth song got a big prize: 40GB iPod, 17" Powerbook and 10,000 songs on the iTunes Music Store!    I am so jealous.

      I am starting to run out of GMail Invite targets.  I have sent out a lot.  Now I am having trouble thinking of new people that might use, or worse, trying to remember if I have already sent them one... or two.  Oh well.  Fire away.

      Well... two week from today I should be just about completely relaxed.  Saturday, July 24th in the afternoon we will be landing in Lihue to start our week vacation in Kauai.  Karen and I are so looking forward to going back we can't stand it.  Joe, Tam, the girls and Debbie will all be arriving Sunday afternoon.  I don't know if there is a way to thank our friends Stevie and Sherri for taking us there in the first place and exposing us to it.  I now look foward to it all year long.  It is my much needed decompress - especially this year.  I have been wound pretty tight (just like everyone else).

                 [The following is from an email sent from Chas on August 7th.]    I don't have a master bedroom yet. There was severe water damage when I came up to look at it. They are almost through though. They have finished most of the re-installation. They have to reset my sink, do some touch-up painting and carpet. The builder took a carpet sample Friday so I expect that to be completed soon and I can move into it and get my living room back where it ought to be.        I haven't even set up my [home theater] system yet because I can't get the bamboo stand that houses all of my equipment where it needs to be until the bedroom is finished. I sure wish [Sean] lived close. I could use [his] help in setting everything up right. I know I will muddle through but when I moved I couldn't believe the morass of wiring I had behind the equipment. When I redo it I will need to be more organized.
