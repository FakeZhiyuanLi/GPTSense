      Hey Friends,   I can't believe another weekend has flown by.  Friday night was spent with the Jordans (Jaimee and Nate); I was able to go see them and their new apartment.  I attempted to put together a bathroom shelf/cabinet thingy, but Nate had to assist.  Between the wood glue, the confusing directions and my inexperience it was quite amusing.  But, in the end the shelf was assembled.    I didn't do much on Saturday.  We watched Jamie's videos from her cruise and youth camp.  We laughed until our sides hurt.  Then Saturday night I baby-sat for the Harrisons.  Lydia, Shane and I played Sorry!, colored in coloring books, watched Romeo (yes Joanne, lil' Romeo has a TV show now) and the Rugrats.  It was a fun filled evening.    Sunday we went to church, my sister and I went to see the Notebook, and then we went to church again that evening.  Church was awesome, especially my new Sunday School class.  I have been attending Mike Scambray' SS class the past two weeks and it totally blesses my heart.  I love it!  Then, Sunday night, the youth gave testimonies about youth camp.  Let's see....then my family had dinner with the other Jordans (Mary and Brandie).    Again, if you haven't read or seen the Notebook.... you should.  Guys:  take your wives or girlfriends.  I promise you will make points.  It is a TRUE love story.  Ok, enough about my busy weekend.  Please be praying for Frontliners!  It will be in Willis in less than a week.  Yea!  I will keep you posted.  God Bless!

      Ok, Ok... so I haven't been doing such a great job at this blogging thing.  I haven't written since the beginning of June, and now June is almost over.  I can't believe it! Well, where do I start?  This is going to be kind of long.  I will update on my summer and then talk about Purpose Driven Life.   Pretty much my Monday through Fridays are pretty redundant and filled with normalcy.  I wake up about 6:30, go to work from 8 to 5, run errands or work out, read (for fun), and then go to bed. (Right now I am reading the Notebook.  It's good...you should go buy it!)  That's about it.  My weekends have been a blast though.   May 28 & 29 - Friday night my grandparents gave us tickets to go see the Astros.  We lost, but still had a good time. Since it was Memorial Day weekend they had a fireworks show after the game.  It was too cool!  Then Saturday was Jaimee King's (now Jordan) bachelorette party in Houston.  That was a night full of memory making.  We had a 2 bedroom suite in a hotel in Houston, a limo and ten crazy girls in cowboy hats.  Too much fun for one evening.   If I can ever figure out how to post pictures... I have some good ones of that night.    June 4-6 - My family reunion in Grapevine!  Friday night we got into town around 9, I guess.  We missed the ice cream making contest, so I decided to hang out with Jeanna, Ryan and Matt.  We sang karaoke!!  Saturday morning we got up and went to Laura's house (my cousin).  We ate, had an auction, took pictures, talked, ate some more, and even played with a rent-a-clown named "Joyfull".  Then all of the younger family members went to play laser tag.  We had a blast.  Sunday morning we ate breakfast and then spent the remainder of the day at the Grapevine Mills Mall with Jim Bob Adams (cause we happened to run into him at the hotel).  It was a great, but tiring weekend.    June 11-12 - Friday night was Jaimee and Nate's rehearsal dinner at the Black Walnut (in the Woodlands).  Saturday the bridesmaids had our hair done at 9 AM, bridal luncheon at noon, and then met at the church at 3:00.  We all got ready to together, took pictures at 4:30, and Jaimee and Nate were hitched by 6:45 PM.  It was beautiful!  The reception followed at April Sound.  We danced the night away.  I was totally blessed that day.  God just reminded me of what amazing friends I have, and how he has someone out there for each of us.  If we will be patient and allow Him to bring us together, then He will bless the wedding (no rain) and [the most important part] the marriage!    June 19 - Ok... I know I am taking forever, so I will try to make this one short.  This past weekend was pretty good.  Friday night my mom and I (and Gentry and Jon Glenn) went up to the Upper Deck to watch karaoke and eat dinner together.  Saturday morning we got up at 4:30 AM, got ready, and drove to Galveston to pick up Jamie from her senior cruise.  We got there around 7:30, so it gave mom and I time to go to Starbucks, sit on their deck and watch the water, drive down the sea wall, and just have some good quality time together.  They got off the boat around 9:00 and we headed home.  The rest of Saturday was pretty uneventful, but Sunday after church we went to Memaw and Papa's for Father's Day lunch.  YUMMY! We had turkey, dressing, sweet potatoes, rolls, and strawberry shortcake for dessert.   Then I took a long nap.    Ok... So, I guess we are caught up now (JK, are you happy?).  I will try to keep this more updated.  As far as PDL goes... I am still loving it.   I actually joined a Sunday School class last week that is doing PDL together.  They are farther along then I am, but I will catch up.  It is a 35 to 55 class, so it is kind of enjoyable to learn from my elders.  To summarize, I guess the biggest thing that God is teaching me is to realize that I am his creation and that he loves me no matter what my grades are and no matter how big my butt is.  He is teaching me to just lean on him for EVERYTHING; just relish in a growing relationship and take time to smell the roses (that he has so graciously given us).    I guess that is about it right now.  I need to get back to work.  We just got back from lunch, so I took a break from reading a motion for summary judgment to type my blog.  I gotta get on it.  Adios Amigos!  Keep in touch!

       Day 1 - It All Starts With God    Have you ever really thought about what your purpose in life is?  That is a deep question.  I am starting Purpose Driven Life again because I never totally completed the book when Southcrest did the study together as a church family.  Also, right now (after finishing my first year of law school) is kinda rough as far as trying to understand what my "purpose" really is.  My grades weren't great, but I love law school.  I love the people, the topics that I am learning about, the professors, etc.  I just don't like the letters that are showing up on my transcript.  It is really scary!  I haven't even thought about what I would do if I can't or don't finish law school.  Right now I am just praying that God will comfort me and that I won't worry.  I hate being an emotional female who worries!!!  In the mean time I am going to spend the next 40 days at the feet of Jesus (learning, growing and having a good time).    This blog thing is crazy!  I don't really think my life is interesting enough to tell the whole world about it, but I will use this as an opportunity to journal (for my own good) and to keep in touch with my wonderful friends (like Jeanna).  Ok... I gotta start packing for our family reunion this weekend.  Goodnight!

      Today was my first day at work and I absolutely loved it!  Today is also my first time to submit an entry to my blog spot.  I have been inspired by Jeanna and Ryan.  I will write more later, but right now I am trying to figure out all the blogging details.  Adios!

       Isaiah 33:2, "O Lord, be gracious to us; we long for you.&nbsp; Be our strength EVERY morning, our salvation in time of distress," &nbsp;  &nbsp; I just had to get on a write about how faithful our God is, and&nbsp; how we should delight in his "daily-ness".&nbsp; The God of the whole universe wants to spend time with little ole' me, he wants to be my best friend.&nbsp;  WOW, that is incredible! &nbsp;We don't have a clue where the path&nbsp;WE choose will lead, but if we will bask in His faithfulness and walk with Him DAILY in obedience, then all of His wonderful plans will be fulfilled.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This all comes from the fact that at the beginning of the summer I didn't know what He had in store for me.&nbsp; I told Him... my life is yours, not mine.&nbsp; I will go where ever you send me.&nbsp; I didn't know if I would be reaccepted into law school, but then I was.&nbsp; Then I didn't know if I would get the financial aid that I needed to be able to pay for school and living expenses.&nbsp; This morning I talked to one of the financial&nbsp;aid women at Tech and she told me that the committee had granted my financial aid.&nbsp; I just had to share my excitement, my answered prayer, and my&nbsp;thankfulness for God's grace.&nbsp;  He is so gracious! &nbsp;&nbsp;I am blessed to be able to continue to attend law school;&nbsp; all blessings flow from Him!&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray that you have a blessed day too!!

       FRONTLINERS ROCKED MY WORLD!     Looking back on the past five days (Sat through Wed) I keep seeing time after time how God manifested himself, answered prayer and changed hearts and lives.  For those of you who don’t know what Frontliners is, it is a chance (in conjunction with a “host” church) for youth groups from all over the United States to come together for 5 days.  The youth are taught how to share their faith, they have the opportunity to implement what they learn every day by going door to door and they have the chance to meet and fellowship with other Christians. (See the website link posted above.) Frontliners, the organization, brings in a team of interns, a band and an evangelist to lead us all week long.  The youth are busy during the days and then the host church members join the Frontliners each evening for a revival and rally.  It is such a blessing!    My family had two amazing girls from FBC Cleveland stay in our home.  You could just see God working in their lives this week.  I have so many stories that I want to share, but I will try to summarize and hit the highest points.   One of Lindsey and Jason’s YoungLife kids (from Rockport) just happened to be in Willis this week visiting family.  Some of the Frontliners knocked on his door one afternoon and invited him to youth night, Tuesday night.  He came and was saved!!  Praise God!     A guy from Clear Lake, named Sean, came with Shannon.  Everyone was praying for Sean this week.  It was so awesome to see God work in his heart from Saturday through Wednesday.  I am happy to say that not only did God bless him by changing his heart and his desires, but he blessed me with a new friend.      There were over 130 salvations and the gospel was shared over 500 times!  Many people came forward to get their baptism in order and one precious student from Willis answered a call to mission work.  Satan tried his best to get everyone down, but as always, our Father prevailed.  I could go on forever, but I will stop there.  When I get my pictures developed I will post some of them.   I have to get back to work (break time is over).  When I have more time I will write about what God did in  my  life at Frontliners.  God Bless, LB      For the word of God is living and active.  Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Hebrews 4:12

      Last night was AWESOME!  I was surprised and elated to see my friends Becky, Justin and Jodi at church last night.  See, they live in the Clear Lake/Pasadena area of Houston and I don't get a chance to see them very often.  God has totally annointed those three people and gifted them with the voices and musical talent to serve others by being a worship band.  They announced last night that they are beginning to raise money to make their first CD (they need about $5,000).  If anyone reading this would like to give to their ministry or if you would like to book them for an event/service, I have included their info below. Also, I have posted a picture of Bec and Justin leading worship at DNOW in January 2004 at FBC Willis.  I am so glad that God has blessed me with their friendships and with the opportunity to be able to hear them lead others into His presence.  THEY ARE AWESOME, and I highly recommend them!!!    Also, my sister had a doctors appt today in Houston.  Our faithful church family surrounded her and prayed for her last night.  It was such an encouragement and a blessing. Jamie was diagnosed as having nodules (kind of like small tumors) on her thyroid a couple of weeks ago.  Well, the specialist told her today that a biopsy is not needed.  Instead, he told her that she has Hashimoto Thyrotis (I probably spelled that incorrectly).  She has to go back to the doctor next Thursday to have more tests run.  Please continue to pray for her!     Undone Ministries   c/o Justin Cheatwood  4423 Arapajo St.  Pasadena, Texas 77504   OR  email Justin at: justin594@hotmail.com

      Hey guys!  It's been a couple of weeks, but I just wanted to let you know that Jamie and I are headed to Lubbock this Saturday.  If you are in Lubbock... give us a call so we can get together.  I have missed all of y'all.  For those of you who are in the Houston or Dallas area... keep in touch.  I will try to continue to blog in between reading and going to class.  Please be praying for me as I begin my second year of law school; Lord knows I need it!  Talk to ya soon.   p.s. I attached some pictures from Amber's birthday party in downtown Houston and from Frontliners in Willis (the other two girls were our host 'sisters').    The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.  James 5:16
