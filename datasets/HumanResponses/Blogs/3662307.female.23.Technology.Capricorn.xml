      Well, it's 8.10am but i dun feel like want to start work so continue with my trip....When we reached Slim Village, I'm surprised at how small the town is. Just 2 rows or less than 10 shops, a market, and a few rows of houses. My mum says it looks the same as 30 years ago except, houses are not wooden anymore but renovated and built again using bricks. Everybody knows everybody else here. Anything happens will be known to everybody....They are a friendly lot and most of them are my mum's friends....So, we went houses by houses, stopping by to chat and eat fruits and then eat more fruits....It's nice seing all the ladies talk bout their young days....and what happened to whom and gossips....We don't need any lunch coz we are eating so much fruits-rambutans, durians, pulasan...yummy and it's all free....Just pick it from the fruit orchards nearby....Many of them are rubber tappers, so was my mum last time...Now, only the older generation lives there. And I do believe they are rich. They are hardworking when they are young and they know how to save money. We can't find any youngster or teenagers around anymore. Even some are so old, they are still so healthy. No sickness or anything. That's the difference between the older generation and us. Not enuz exercise, unhealthy food, pollution, stress....the list goes on. And they have A LOT of children. I mean a lot like 10, 12 kids. Boy, I salute them. So, when it's time to leave, we were given fruits- yes fruits again...It's happy to see my mum and her freinds reunited after about 30 years. Well worth the trip. We plan to come again and this time maybe stay overnite and we can try tapping rubber also...It'll be fun....

      With less than 6 hrs of sleep, i woke up sharp at 6am tis morning.We're going back to my my mum's vllage today!! I've never been there b4 so, it's quite an experience for me and my sis.We picked up pne of my mum's old friend and we're on our way- destination is Slim Village in Perak. With exactly 1 hr of driving (without speeding lar- coz my mum will blah blah blah if i did), we reached Tanjung Malim. Very small town....We had breakfast there.Yummyyyy and cheap 'yong tau foo' and mee.....Next destination- Sg Bil- where my mum used to visit so often when she was young. The water there is still clean and cold with awesome scenery. Too bad we didn't bring any swimming material...After about 10 mins of driving one small, winding and narrow road, we finally reach Slim Village. Oh yeah, one thing i notice bout small townsan villag eis the people are extremely friendly. We are not very sure of the waya  few times and when we asked aound, they are very eager to help with a smile...Don't think city dwellers will be as helpful as that....Yawn....So sleepy an tire now so will continue tomorrow....Time o sleep now....

      Gmail->Yahoo mail->Hotmail.....Will post more comments later but just a quick synopsis...Google introduces it's mail service Gmail offering bigger space and better service than the major free mail service providers. And this initiated the war. Yahoo follow suit by giving 100Mb of space ad now Hotmail with 250Mb of space.....Thanks to Gmail that we now have much more space in Yahoo n Hotmail....he he he.....

      Had breakfast in Hotel Istana yesterday...Nothing much interesting.Just the same as other buffet breakfasts....An ex colleague n a close friend started his new job today, so all the best to him....It's tough trying to blend in the first few days at a new job. So many things to learn and people to know....Good luck Nick... The haze is back....This morning saw a handsome guy jogging in the city, shirtless....Nice bod but to be jogging here in the city? Isn't it a bit unhealthy? Hmmm....Received a touching mail from a good friend, encouragng me to change job....Find something of my interest and don't waste anymore time...Thanks Nash, I will do my best....Thanks for your support....

      Dun feel like going to work today but have to coz engineers coming for training....So noisy in the office and when they left, peace and quiet....Had an eventful day today. Almost had an argument with Finance over the internal processes....So complicated. Sent the phone over to Derek.At 3pm, had an interview at Starbucks, Menara Prime. Nice talking to the Singaporean lady, a recruitment consultant. Then at 5pm, went over to Istana to collect the projector. Had a little chat with the trainer, Mr Sim. Got the vouchers for bfast. He he he...Oh yeah, today while walking back from lunch, saw ths guy picking his noise in his parked car at the roadside. Disgusting. Why people tend to do that when they are idle in the car???

      Something funny happen yesterday, in the office. A colleague came to me with RM7-saying he found it in one of the corridors. Told me to broadcast a mail to all asking who lost it....I found it amusing....I mean, it's just RM 7!!! Honestly, if I found it, sudah masuk pocket loh.....Anyway, i said he found it so it's better he handle it. In the end, it ends up in HR and a mail was sent out. I wonder if anybody claims it....Hmmm...must go sibuk sibuk in HR today....Wat would you do if you found it?

      I know that from the moment I accept the new job offer, there are a lot of things that I have to give up. And some of these things made other people around me feel disappointed. I am so sorry but I need to think of myself sometimes. We all need to be selfish at one time or another, for our own good.â€¦.

      I've got the job!!!! So happy but nervous at the same time. New challenge for me....IT consultant...Sounds nice eh....At least I'm on the IT track now. I tendered my resignation to Jennie and Arthur. No surprise for them coz I've long hinted that I really want to join the IT line.&nbsp;Have yet to tell Peter, I bet he'll be quite surprise that I have to leave in such a short notice. I'll miss them lar. Although there are some bad times but I've grown a lot here. And not forgeting all the guys (*wink*wink*)&nbsp; that I've grown quite close to. I'll miss you allll.Don't bully the new secretary, okie?....And my thanks to F&amp;C and HR for all the help that they given....A bit hesitant to leave but I must move on. So, goodbye ALSTOM and here I come, NTT......

      Went down to 5th floor on Wednesday to collect some files. Reminds me back of last year when we were still there.Lots of good and bad memories. I used to wonder why some things that are not meant to be happened. Things that made us sad and happy at the same time. Things that gives us pleasure and guilt at another time. It's really hard to understand but all things happened for a reason. It makes us grow stronger and more mature. Good or bad, it's how we think of it. It's how we analyse it. So, occasionally, you might be sadden by it but hey...it's in the past....

      5.10pm on a rainy Friday evening. I started my journey to Informatics for the class. Knew it would be jammed up coz of the rain earlier. Half way thru Jln Pinang, I realized I left my phone in my office drawer. Turned back to office and the second time I left is 5.40pm.&nbsp; And believe it or not, I reached Informatics @ 7.15pm. A 15-minute journey become a 1 1/2 hr trip. And what caused it? No, not the rain, not flash floods but Malaysian drivers. Yes, drivers that apparently doesn't know what a yellow box is for. I don't really know how people can be so thick skin to sumbat inside the yellow box, knowing that they will not be able to go for the next 15 minutes. Just because of that, I have to watched the traffic light turn green, amber, red, green, amber, red......Other drivers started honking, but&nbsp;what's the use? And for that 1 1/2 hr, there are not a single traffic police in sight. Sigh....driving in KL really is a pain in the ass.....

      Holy shit! I just got called for the second interview in NTT-MSC. This time they want a presentation about their products and company. I have to go through the website and then come up with a creative presentation. Should I or should I not go? It's for a sales cum support position. Really have to think through whether it's suitable for me or not. Sometimes just feel like giving up after so many interviews and then it's either they find me not good enough for them or I find them not suitable for me. I think I am really slipping into the comfort zone now. Part of me wants to change job but then the other part is scared of leaving what I have now. What if the new job turns out worst than this one? What if I can't take leave to go to NZ this coming Nov? what if I fail in doing a sales job as I have an introvert personality? This is what risk taking means. Trying something new and not knowing what will happen. I still have a few days to think about it.....

      Ai yo...I went to an interview in Cyberjaya yesterday. Company is NTT MSC- Japanese-owned company. So, I was not nervous at first because I went to many interviews before mah. When I go into the room, it reminded me of Malaysian Idol. There are 5 interviewers1 I started to get nervous as two of them were Japanese and when they start asking questions, it was so difficult to catch what they are saying.But then they are very friendly. In fact the local interviewers are worst. Their attitude and they way they asked questions are a bit sarcastic....Anyway, I was lucky because for this interview, I did my homework. I searched about their company and prepare the common questions asked during an interview. Everything went ok but...my handphone rang in the middle of the interview!!! I really forgot to turn it off. So there goes 20% of my marks....So, just keep my fingers crossed.

      It's been 1 week i didn't update my blog....Busy lah...Have to study...So, let's see what happended in the past week....Well, I can't think of anything interesting except that I went to Starlight cinema yesterday, Saturday 10th July 2004. Got 4 free tickets so don't want to waste it.  Cool experience....We(me, Poh Wai, Kong and Foong Ling)went about 5 sumting, arriving at Bukit Kiara around 6pm and surprisingly many people are already there. Parking is a big disadvantage as we need to walk VERY FAR to reach the entrance to the cinema. But what the heck, the experience is worth it. We saw that cute guy from 8TV Quickie, whom I do not know the name. Anyway, Mai and Imran suppose to meet us there later but it was so crowded that they can't walk to our spot. Well, there are still a lot of room for improvement. 1) Parking- should open up more parking in the club itself and not all around it. 2) Entrance- should be more organised 3) Toilets- hmmmm.....as usual-Malaysian public toilets but 10x worst 4) Designate walkways to let people go in and out instead of having to step on people's mattresses 5) More food stalls!!!! 6) Ban people with smelly feet and shoes from taking off their shoes....uhhhh....the smell in horrible....  We are very luck that it did not rain and the weather is so cooling. We only stay for the first movie (they are showing LOTR trilogy, BTW). I wouldn't mnd staying till 7am in the morning because I LOVE LOTR!!!! Anyway, it was a well worth experience minus the smelly feet and smoking from some people who doesn't know what NO SMOKING means. So, a second time if I have the chance? COUNT ME IN!!!

      I won!!!! I won second prize of a LOTR contest. Although the prizes are of not much use (keychain, characters collectible, mug and the trilogy VCDs-which i already have) but being an avid fan of LOTR, I am so happy!!!! Just hope the VCDs are the extended versions. The news really made my day yesterday....

      While driving to the office this morning, I was thinking that it would be nice to have a younger sibling. Someone to call me 'cheh cheh', someone I can send to school/ tuition/anywhere, someone that I can help with their studies or just someone for me to bully. It would be nice also to have a older brother to take care of me.....
