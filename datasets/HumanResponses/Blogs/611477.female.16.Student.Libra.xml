       urlLink At my Yahoo photo album   (Hope that works!)    That's Jenny-O , the turkee.  She wouldn't stay still for any more pictures; camera is acting up worse than the cats.    I started my "French Market Bag" last night.  I should get my act together and properly join the FMB KAL, no? (Ow.)  Using some Nature Spun  urlLink 766lord  sent me... I'm considering taking over a small Carribean island and naming her my queen... well, that'd be a bit odd, even for me.    Also in the midst of Kool-Aid dying some wool for something else. Spiffy... other than all the wait! I'm enjoying it.

      Whoo!  Cat sweater finished!  Frit was the only cat who would stay still long enough for me to put it on her.  I would have taken a picture of her in it, but she headed towards the cat box... pulled the sweater off before she got any ideas. *grin*   I'll get pictures as soon as the cats decide they don't hate me anymore.

      My active knitting projects are both nearly finished; I see no reason to put the list on the side for now, but here they are:  Green Blob / Mystery Not-Tank #4 (looks something like  urlLink this ) I'm probably 90% done, but it's not coming out quite how I'd like... if I never finish it, it's never gone horribly wrong, right?  Yeah.  Ain't so bad, really... but I ain't been in the mood lately to keep creating that pattern.   Cat sweater Made in random bits of thrift shop acrylic I couldn't find a pattern I like, so I'm winging it. Not being able to figure proper armhole placement, I'm going to try steeks.  Better to practice on this than on a 4-month sweater, right?   Next up after I finish either of those: Better Mousetrap Socks - Interweave Knits, Fall 2001 French Market Bag - whatever Knitty that was  That's the plan, at least... who knows.  And now, for gratuitous lyrics that will stretch out the entry... until I get enough entries to properly shape the page, this'll do... give me more breathing room to add to the sidebar.....   Nautical Wheelers who call themselves sailors  Play fiddle tunes under the stars  Petticoats rustle, workin' shoes scuffle  Shuffle on down to the bar   Where the jukebox is blastin' and the liquor is flowin'  An occasional bottle of wine  That's 'cause everyone here is just more than contented  To be livin' and dyin' in three-quarter time   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go   Well, the left foot'll follow  Where the right foot has travelled  Down to the sidewalks unglued  Into the streets of my city so neat  Where nobody cares what you do  Sonia's just grinnin' and Phil is ecstatic  Mason has jumped in the sea  And I'm hangin' on to a line from my sailboat  All Nautical Wheelers save me   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go   Well the sunrise'll bring on  Sleep that's escaped us  Everyone's off to their bed  There'll be huggin', squeezin'  Little pleazin' and teasin'  And rubbin' of each other's heads  So won't you dream on compadres, seems nothing escapes you  Nothin', no reason, no rhyme  That's 'cause everyone here is just more than contented  To be livin' and dyin' in three-quarter time   And it's dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  Take me to stars that you know  Come on and dance with me, dance with me, Nautical Wheelers  I want so badly to go  I want so badly to go  Yes, I want so badly to go

      I can't get the layout back to its original glory... until I have the inspiration to make my own, I'll use this theme.    Right, I'm making this many posts first day back so I can, up, stuff.   Titles I'm not good at... look at "Of Biting Rodents and Fruitcakes", mmkay?  Sing "Fruitcakes"; the title will make a little sense. (But not much.)

      Okay, peoples.  I don't yet know how much I'll post here or what I'll post here, but for y'all in KnittyLand here's a summary....   This blog was originally made in April of '02.  I posted in it regularly for about three months; then I got out of the habit and abandoned it.  Today I recovered my password... but alas, in re-registering this, the remnants of my old blog were deleted.  Big loss.  Now y'all will never know that on July 18 2002, a crab bit me.     Under reconstruction - stay tuned!

      I've cast on for another couple things today... I really ought to finish what I'm doing first, no?  To keep my own twisted mind un-twisted:  RESEAM Mystery Tank #2.  I stitched it a little tight... one day while I was straighening it I snapped the yarn I seamed with. Oops.  12 July edit: Done!  And you can't even tell I used green yarn... w00t!    FINISH both fingerless gloves which I've started over the last few days.  One is top-down; the other is wrist-up.  I've stalled at the thumb on both.  10 July edit: top-down glove finished; not good.   11 July edit: I tried the other glove on before doing the thumb and realised that it's too loose.  As my hands and I hate needles smaller than 3.5mm with all the firey hatred of hell that a faerie (chinchilla) princess can muster, I ain't trying again.  Sorry. (And the same goes for Christmas!)   REBLOCK my FMB.  I'd have to get the gloves-in-progress out first.  15 July edit: Being done now.  If it comes out well, dandy.  If not, big whoop.  How's that for English?   FINISH Mystery Not-Tank #4.  I don't like it anymore (wah) but I'm going to finish it, *then* frog it.  It's hogging my #7 circs.  15 July edit: Almost done... though I'm not sure I'm going to finish it by the end of this week as I'd hoped.   FROG my attempt at socks on two circs, started last October or November.  I haven't worked on them in well over 6 months.  Besides the nasty ladder along the edge, get this... I started them in 100% cotton.  (Stretch has been known to help socks....)  They've been taunting me for the last two seasons, but I think I've finally learned everything that can be taught from such a failure.   10 July edit: I started these because a person asked for red socks.  I didn't *promise* her something but I think she's expecting them anyway.  Current plan - make her a red FMB, keep raggedy dead socks as they are, show her the pathetic socks, give her FMB (sans socks). (wha?)   FINISH this second FMB I just started.  Grumblemuttergrumble.  Remind me why this is so addictive?  15 July edit: Done! Look to the right for link to album.   What else... dunno.  I'll add later.

       urlLink Finished French Market Bag  - filled out with 6 skeins of DenimStyle *drool*.  (Just as a reminder for when the Acrylics Anonymous folks come by to approve me. ;) )     urlLink And the rest   I was up all night finishing that... really.  Bound off at 2:45 or so... considered running it through the wash then, but figured that may wake the natives.  Instead I tossed it aside and tried double knitting.  In theory I understood it... and coincidentally enough, I was actually able to do it.  For now I'm trying to make *one* fingerless glove - not one of those wimpy things which goes to the knuckles, but rather a glove which has half-fingers or some such.  Just one.  Not writing down the pattern.  Was I really up all night?  Yeah... I did get a bit of sleep from about 8:45 - 9:30 this morning... summer.  But the FMB...  you'd think I could listen by now, but no.  Ran it through the wash inside a sewn-up towel used for bathing the cats.  Really, I don't mind the white flecks.  I think it could be shrunk a little more than those pictures show....  Unfelted, the base was (about) 18" x 16".  Now it's about 12" by 14".  Before a trip through the Washing Machine of Doom, the height was about 12" - can't be more than 8" now.  (Note to self: Next time, smaller base and taller sides)  Yeah, I didn't do anything like blocking or shaping yet.  If/when I run it through the wash one more time I'll try something more involved than hanging the bag from two chairs and putting a massive dictionary wrapped in Wal-Mart bags inside.  (Ayup.)     Gratuitous Buffett lyrics:   Constantly searching, oh my eyes have seen some horizons And I've crossed the ocean for more than just thrills No I'm not the first, won't be the last You lust for the future but treasure the past

       urlLink "If you really love me you'll let me run nude"    urlLink The rest of the pictures   If you'd like to use some up some short pieces of random worsted weight (ish) acrylics, why not try a sweater for your cat (or dog or goat)?  This pattern also uses  urlLink steeks  - it's much better to overcome your aversion to cutting your knitting on an acrylic pet sweater that's taken two afternoons instead of trying steeks for the first time on your 2-month fair isle masterpiece!  Finished size - 18" around; 10" long.  If you'd like the pattern re-written for a different sized pet, leave a comment.    Yarn - any worsted weight acrylics that knit to about 5 sts and 6 rows per inch.   Cast on 90 sts in colour #1 In K2, P2 rib, work 12 rows  (approx. 2")  Change to colour #2; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch ( 24 rows from cast on; 4")   Change to colour #3; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch (36 rows from cast on; 6")  Change to colour #4; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch (48 rows from cast on; 8")  Change to colour #1 Work 2 rows in stockinette stitch Next row - ( K2 together (2x) , p2 ) 8 times, (p2 , K2 tog (2x) ) 7 times (so it's all rib-ey except for the four where it's not) (60 sts) Next 5 rows - follow rib pattern because I really don't want to figure how to type that again   Next row - change to k1, p1 rib (except for the 4 purls in the center, where instead you'll end up with two k's next to each other) Work three more rows, bind off  (If your cat would prefer a higher neck than what is shown, work another several rows in rib.  Simple enough.)  Sleeves: Cast on 24 sts in colour #1 K 6 rows in garter stitch, cast off Seam up side, clone sleeve. Or knit another, it's all good.    Now for the fun part!  Your main body piece is flat and as wide as the pet is round - as shown, 90 stitches.  On the stripe of the fourth colour, count in between 15 and 20 stitches and follow the  urlLink steeking  instructions.  Takes a bit of trust, but it's a gorgeous result.  Working the steek over either 3 or 5 stitches are both good, though I'd recommend doing it on just 3.    After you've crocheted your steek and cut the ladders, double-check that you didn't cut to far anywhere and the ends won't come unraveled.  Now grab your little sleeves and seam them to their respective pawholes.   Sew up the two sides of the body and weave in all the ends!  The best way to hunt down a cat and get them to wriggle in, well, that's your problem.  If you have any trouble with this pattern please comment - I'm more than willing to try to explain any confusing phrasing.

      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  In the midst of swatching, I'm loitering around the Knitty board and  urlLink another finished Cleo  makes me think... that might be fun.  No.  Nooo.  I don't need another thing on the to-do list.  So why not do something shorter?  Like the bra part?  Looking at  urlLink Petit Chou  I think, that won't be much knitting.  I can draw out my own size, make what shape I want, and do some lace-ish pattern which actually looks nice.  It won't be a long project.  I can always frog.  (But where's the fun in a project you can't show off?)  No, I have enough I want to do!  Another tank and a  little  felted bag and finish the bag I've got going... that's not so much.  Fine.  As soon as I finish this row of this swatch I'll go fetch different yarn and... do another swatch.    Actually I haven't started the next felted thing.  It's just high on my list.  Maybe I should put the yarn where I can't find it.    It's near 1 AM and these may be overcaffeinated ramblings again.     9 AM edit - Finished already!  It's a halter neck, I guess.  Used Cotton Fixation and knit the whole thing in garter stitch.  For a first freehanded attempt it came out decent.  The cup/triangle thingies came out a bit too small, though.  No, I will not post a picture of me wearing it.  Now I have an excuse to knit Cleo - have something to wear under it.  (I told me, I have enough to do!!)    Entertaining diversion.  I didn't expect me to do this.   Edit #2 -  urlLink Picture(s)   .

      How poorly written last post was.  Besides entirely too many "yeahs" in the last few sentences... meh.  Nevermind.  I told you, it was a long day.    Now I'm trying to figure out the best way to wash my swatches.  I don't rightly intend to always hand wash my FOs... might as well make a couple swatches in a different yarn until I figure me out.

      My second bag is done and it's wonderful, if I do say so myself.  A bit smaller than the last, but it was quite a bit less knitting - besides making only one handle/strap/whatever instead of two, I made one set of sides shorter.   Instead of square-like, it's more rectangle-like.    The full saga!  Using some wool I dyed with Kool-Aid a couple weeks bag, I picked out a ball of Grape and cast on somewhere around 40 stitches.  I never did do an exact stitch count until I got to the strap.  I knit with that colour until I ran out.  It was about a square.  Picked up a bunch of stitches all around.  I'd used a provisional cast on; nice change of pace from picking up stitches.  Then I did a bunch of decreases on the picked-up sides since it'd be shrinking lengthwise and I didn't want wonky sides like on the last.  (Would not picking up as many stitches the first time around have caused holes or weakness on the base?  I didn't want to find out.)  Knit a bunch of rounds with the different colours I'd made until I got tired of that.  (Colours: Red, light red, light red and purple, purple, dark purple and red, red and purple, and red.  And another couple of balls of some solid colour.  I didn't split the skein evenly. :) )  Last couple of rounds I knit with some leftover eyelash yarn from the parrot's wings.  I followed the stitches up from the corners of the base and put markers somewhere around there and put the stitches from the cast on sides (what ones wouldn't shrink as much) on holders for the strap.  For the other edges (which would shrink as much as they wanted) I p2tog across a row and then bound off fairly tightly.  Came out pretty much as I'd planned.   Amazingly enough, when I got to the end of that binding off ordeal, the ball of wool and the ball of eyelash each had under 2 feet left.  I didn't plan it that way!  You think I'd really unwind the eyelash stuff to find out? (Didn't think so.)  Anyways, back to the strap.  Did a couple symmetrical stripes which I am quite pleased with.  Bound off.  Felted.  So yeah, that was probably boring to read. (Sorry.)  Yeah, if you've already done a couple of these that's not so original.  Well thankyouverymuch, I didn't read any pattern which tightened up the sides as I did. Neener neener!  Yeah, yeah, it's been a long day and I'm going to adore myself, thankyouverymuch.  Pictures coming when I get the newspaper out of the bag.  (Yeah, I'm actually shaping it this time!  What a novel idea!)  Now swatching for my next mystery tank.  Wonder how it will turn out WITHOUT twisted stitches?

      And in one sidebar update Mystery Tank #5 vaults from 10% to 75%....  So I've got a bunch of stitches on a holder for whenever I figure out what I want the neck to look like....  I was actually a good rodent and washed my swatch and decently measured it and all that... I know when I get around to washing this thing it'll shrink a bit and should be the proper length but I can't help but think it'll be atrociously long.  Keep telling meself, if it comes out strange you can always fix it later... blah.   Heh, I just found out my brother has a blog here on Blogger.  While I won't flat-out give it away... okay, go to my profile and click on the town name.  Of the 6, pick the most psychotic.  That's him, unless you chose me.  Go for the second most psychotic.

      Oy. Why am I trying to write down what I'm doing as I do it when I just undo it a couple rows later?   My whatever-in-progress is coming along fine. It caused a few tangles, but I unraveled one of the shoulders to redo the neckline. I'll tackle the other in a few minutes. On the other end, I'm about... 5 inches past the short rows... but not much exists before the short rows. Huh.   Work, oh mystical picture!    I kinda like this pattern, but I'm concerned that after washing and losing some length it'll become too busy. Maybe I should've made it once every 8 rather than 4 rows. This scan is from the edges of the short rows... one of these sides. I'm not sure how to explain the wonkiness there. Maybe later.     Midnight edit... (Hey, it's my blog.  Why don't I just make a new post?) Facing the... front, that's the right side.  If I knew what I was doing I'd be able to explain what happened.  Nah.  So what I've got now is a bunch of stitches on one needle for the front neck-ish area. *Right below* that spot I cast on a bunch more stitches both sides to wrap around the back... yeah, yeah, I said I'd knit it in two pieces... guess not, now.  This sounded more different-er.  One piece, one seam on the back.  I'll figure out a way to make it a feature.  (On the back?)  I'm confusing myself again.... overcaffeinated late-night/early-morning rambles.  (At least I'm not driving around playing loud music.)   I'd restart and make sense but I have no idea what I'm typing about.  (Don't I have a different journal for this drivel?)

      (Having no idea what to title half these posts, I'm adopting the method I use for some Yahoo photo albums.  Lyrics or song title from what I'm listening to at the moment.  Current music: "Uncle John's Band" - Jimmy Buffett.)  Update on previous post: Second incarnation completed!  (In Mr. Burns voice) Excellent....  but it doesn't seem too photo-friendly; the neck part seems frighteningly short, though it fits fine.  Now I've got to make myself a decent thing to wear over it. :)   In other news, though I haven't finished #4, I've started on Mystery Tank #5.   (Notes on the numbering system: Mystery Tanks and Mystery Not-Tanks are grouped together because often enough at the start I haven't decided on sleeves yet.  What a mystery!)  Mystery Tank #5, so far, is being knit top-down.  During the diversion of the last post's project, I realised... hey!  Garter stitch actually looks kinda cool!  But busy.  So for this tank, every other "wrong"/purl side, I'm knitting a row... kinda interesting.  (Let's see if I'm still saying that when I'm wearing it!)    I'm actually considering making this halter-like... how well does knitting unravel backwards from a provisional cast on?  Meh... braining for another day.  I'm at the front short rows for this thing now... maybe I can actually "hide" the wraps decently, not twisting all the stitches.      ---> Or should that be       \|    -?  Anyway, status bars updated.

(apologies if that offends certain religions or political parties *g* )   Anyway, I made a couple washclothes last night/this morning but haven't taken a picture for some odd reason.  Now I'm making something akin to  urlLink this  - it's completely different except for mine still being entrelac. *g*  Hopefully it won't felt too weird, me using scraps like this.

      No pictures yet because it's so hot and the thought of pulling on wool socks makes me melt.  Maybe at midnight.  I want to do a third but I don't have the yarn for it... and I don't have three feet.  Oh well.  The rearrangement of the living room is coming along nicely - maybe soon I'll be able to get into my other stashes of craftiness which were swept up into the tidying where I can't get them.  Yet.

      I finished the flamingo this morning.  Quick project - hardest part was finding where I'd left the shuttles, beads, thread, and crochet hooks of the right size!     Still having not decided what to do with Mystery Tank #5 V 1.0 and not wanting to touch Mystery Tank #4, I started a new project.  Socks.  Again.  Sock, really.   urlLink Quit it with the words! .  Not wanting to spend particularly long on this, either, I'm using a heavier gauge yarn.  Meh, they'll be good for the three weeks of winter. "They"?  As if I'd do more than one. ;)  I really would rather be doing another felted bag, but I don't have much wool around here.  Just the leftovers from the last two bags - it'd take some braining to figure out how to use the different yarns, and I'm still under the impression it's a very bad idea to leave me alone with me.     So, flamingo picture.  I really ought to get off my duff and get meself a photobucket account rather than hotlinking off Geocities.

I've been neglecting my tatting of late.  Nothing's leapt out at me "TAT ME!!!".  Well, just this afternoon a couple new patterns were posted by who must be the Goddess of Tatting.  (When I was first learning to tat I asked for basic help on one of the Yahoo groups and she gave me the clearest instructions.  Wasn't until a few weeks later I realised that I had been in the presence of genius.) So my current project...  urlLink Flamingo!  .  Mine must adore shrimp - using hot pink!

      (Current music: "For What It's Worth" - CSN&Y version from the live album "4 Way Street". )  I finished the bottom edge and looking at the current length, I think it's close to a minidress. Really. I should finish the neck part today, though; maybe the whole thing will be finished today... unless I decide it's atrocious. Then it'll be another week. *nods* (huh?)  I figure if I *didn't* measure right and it does turn out too long after washing... and if "too long" really is too long and not just a features flaw (huh?)  I can either unravel it all or cut it in the middle and graft the parts together (somehow).  That second idea sounds a bit tetched - just my style.  If I mess it up, well, I'd have had to redo it anyway... but that's assuming I'm right, which is a very bad assumption to make.  (huh?)

      I finished the third sock today with the yarn (same stuff, different colour) I bought in Pensacola... I like the nonsensical colour change.  Mwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  Pictures will be posted when pictures are posted.   I'm hoping to work on Mystery Whatever That Thing Is #5 tomorrow... there's really not much more to do on it, but it's at the point where I have to do a bit, try it on, see how it is, maybe undo what I just did and maybe duplicate it exactly for the other side... braining.    Trying not to get too settled in... heading right back away from home for a week starting Tuesday, so I should be preparing for that... but I want to just rest for a while after the... whatever relatives are.

I should have an interestingly multicoloured sock finished sometime today (Friday!!)  but I want to just enjoy being home for a while before getting some sleep.  At least catch up with online activities from the first half of the week, then find some of this week's shows my brother taped for me and knit at the TV for a while.  Most of my washclothes I left for my grandparents, so no pictures of what I did.  Next time I visit I know they'll be somewhere easy to find.  They had some crafts I did EIGHT YEARS AGO still hanging from their fridge.  Ah, grandparents.  (They have 10 grandkids, but I could only spy loot from about half of them.  My grandparents are still unpacking from their move three years ago!)  Last entry I posted the link to the board for most of my rambles about this trip - go there for the full story.  Hmph.  It might be a while before I get caught up!

      Because I'm 500 miles from my knitting.  I did knit a few washclothes in the car, though - depending on if I figure out my grandparent's software I might post picutres. (Probably not.)  Any questions or comments,  urlLink post at the board ... I ain't sure I can keep track of all my online goings-on!   How did I end up with so much on my LiveJournal friends list?  To catch up to yesterday afternoon took 50 posts!  (Okay, mainly their knitting community...) so anyway, not much knitting.  I may check out the LYS if I have time.

      Jenny-O says to me, you disturbed me for THIS?   (If image doesn't load,  urlLink see it here .)  The sock on the left is the first one - I MEANT to do that.  Yeah.  Ran out of that colour.  Also, I MEANT to make the second one longer.    ( urlLink Hello! )  ( urlLink And the rest )

      Over the past couple days I've joined a few more rings (Texas Knitters and Southern Knitters) - still waiting approval on Knitting Kitty.  Moved the "archives" to the bottom of the page, and added a variety of buttons you can yoink to link to me if so inclined.    Now I'll try to take a picture of the sock mentioned last post and the other one I finished today... cross your toes and hope it doesn't crash the computer!
