       I'm a person who don't usually say out my problem...Just can't find a person to sit down and talk...So even if I have any problem. I just sit down there and keep quiet..Or sometime I just smile even i'm not happy...But if sometime that person ofference me... I confirm give that person a nice black face... And also those nice nice words will come out... Yupz... that's me... I last time had a quarrel with my friend..Don't wanna say the name out... I think got 1 month never talk to her... At times i felt guilty, sad and also angry... But i always think that it's my fault for starting that stupid quarrel... Why izzit my fault. Because if i talk to her. She will not get to know about his percussion guy in band... And also will not go into relationship with him... And as i can see, she love him with all her heart... But that idiot just don't know how to treasure her...In my eye he really treat her badly... And i hated him alot... If you were in my shoes and your friend is some how so call bully in that way will u like it...will you bare to see it... Up till now i still hate him... Maybe he had some good points...but i still don't like the character he has... Well it's the pass...but this guiltiness still make me feel bad... I still think that it's my fault... I cause this thing to happen... it's all my fault...

       In School many things happen... At first i get to know Alvin. Then slowly i get to noe Benjamin & Ping Loon... Everytime when teacher give us break the four of us will go and eat together... Although i'm the onli ger in that group...Always feel good when i'm with them...Then as days pass.. We get to noe this ger name Qiu Feng... Then Later we get to noe Jason that group...WOah tell u all.... they were really crappers...Always full of craps &amp; crappy stuff...that make people laugh untill stomache...Then i always dun noe y.. all of the sudden i go like my friend Benjamin(why all the things i like must always start with the Letter B..FOr example Band & Ben)...Well it think it's fate ba(sound so bu yao lian)... Then At the same this qiu feng also noe...At first qiu feng and i quite close den everything was doing fine... but later there is always something caught in the middle... when she sit beside ben... she always want to attrack attention from mi want to make mi jealous... And i really hate her... Then after awhile i stop toking to her... stop hanging out with all the gang i usually hang out with... Then I get to noe shi lei(dun say i never mention ur name), zi jun that group &amp; that loudspeaker... I told them except that loud speaker i like ben all tis stuff lah... Feel so happy to noe them... They are also tok crap sometimes...But they r not as bad as qiu feng... wanting to scatch ben away from mi... As days pass... i decided to tok to qiu feng... some how so call forgive her ba... jus dun trust her animore... Even if i still like ben now or i like someone else... i die die also won't tell her... Really scare that she will scatch away ben or someone again...

      When i'm alone...i always think back...Think about the happy & sad things happen in the past...Many happy things happen in my life that i will never forget...For Example Celebrating Mark's [Lao Tai GOng]Birthday the way we torture him, Kana suan by my shsb family member or when toking crappy things...haha really got alot of fun...Then about sad things I will think about how my friend make my bf n i break up, SOme women trying to steal the guy i like away, or some idiotic people make life diffcult for either one of my shsb family member...I tell u i will make sure the idiotic pple life even worst then wat they giv to my friends...But after thinking all that... i feel that in life pple have to be happy & sad... But when u think about sad things better dun think of going commit suicide or watever thing that r stupid... After doing that i tell u regret also no use le... u r going to die... SO moral of the story is ask u dun do stupid things..

Feel bad about it...Cause i jus lose a friend jus like tat...And i really think that it's not worth to do tat...n the world out there r waiting for u to explore...If u got ani problem jus find someone to talk dun always keep in ur heart n keep on thinking... if that's the case u will neber find a way out for it... Find someone that u trust n talk... i tell u... u will surely feel great after that... Next topic is: Treasure the love one &amp; Friends beside you... yesterday night (2 Aug 2004) went for my V.G friend's dad furneral... I tell u at that moment i really feel that i must really treasue the love one beside me... Whether if it's ur friends, ur relative or who ever... U must Treasure them when they r still around.. If not when they r gone u will really miss them...If u hate ur friend to the core...tried to forgive n forget... If not the next time when they r not around le... i gurantee u confirm feel guilt de...
