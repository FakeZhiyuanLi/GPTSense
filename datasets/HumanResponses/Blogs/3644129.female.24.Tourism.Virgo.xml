       I   HATE   Reminiscing.   Don't get me wrong, I am a very sentimental person. You'll know by the junk I have at home! Hehehe!   Kidding aside, I  AM  Sentimental. The thing is, I hate it when I reminisce the days of old.   Why? Because it makes me so sad to think that most of the people I cherished those moments with, are gone. No, they're not DEAD! They just lead different lives now. So different, we don't even get to talk much when we bump into each other. There is just NOTHING in common anymore. And it SUCKS!   I don't think I have changed much. I still enjoy what I have enjoyed in the last 10 years of my life. (Which makes my psychological age, 14 years old). I like watching light-hearted and mainstream movies, Pop/Alternative music, giggling, small chit-chats... Juvenile, I know. I also enjoy just bumming at home, sleeping and watching the tube.   I guess the only thing that changed in me is my desire to be in a more serene, calm, quiet environment. That is the only thing that matured in my personality, among other things.   Most of my "old friends" are either in their final years of Medical School, doing their Residency, working in some uptight office somewhere, having babies or have different friends altogether.   Time is also a factor which separates me from my "old friends." They don't have time, and I have lots of it. It's either that or their schedules don't jive with mine. I would gladly give my time to them, though, if they did the same for me. Unfortunately, that is not the case.   In short, our   PRIORITIES   have changed a lot. I still have them on my priority list, however, it seems that I have disappeared from theirs. To think I used to consider them as my BEST Friends or my Closest Friends. And that bit is what   HURTS   the most.   That's why I live my life one day at a time. I keep myself from getting attached to people, in fears of having to suffer the same consequences of my "previous life." I guess the   ONLY   friend you can ever rely on in your life is   YOURSELF  . At least, when you look back and reminisce on your times with yourself, you don't get disappointed that you lost that person in one way or another.   This does not mean that I'd throw away all those friendships that I have previously formed. That is not the case. I just think I was the one trashed.   Here's to finding the Diamond in the Rough...

       I did something dumb this week.   I forgot to submit my Log Records before the Cut-Off.   I can hear people saying: "So What?!?"   Well, here's the catch. It is office policy to submit your Log Records (Logs In and Out) before each Cut-Off Period (the 9th and 24th of every month), otherwise you do not get your Pay Check for that Pay Period. In short, I will not be receiving my Pay Check at the end of the month.   Ooohhh... Tough!   Well, there is a   Logically Sound and Utterly Stupid   story behind that.   First, let's do the   Logically Sound   reason: As I checked my Log Records for this Cut-Off, I realized that my Manager uploaded the wrong schedule, failing to amend the Rest Day Swap that my Co-Worker and I applied for. I also had to apply for a Log Modification, since the system did not Log me out on one of the days.   After my manager did the modifications and necessary adjustments, one of my Logs disappeared! The system deleted it! I immediately informed my Manager and she tried to fix it. She even had to call the System Administrators since it wasn't budging. When it was finally fixed, we were relieved.   Now, the   Utterly Stupid   reason: I wasn't really myself that evening. My car's brakes almost gave out on me while I was on my way to work. It was raining hard, too. I was dead scared when I got to the office, knowing something might've happened to me if my brakes died. I also wasn't able to get some decent sleep that morning, when I got home.   When it was almost time for me to go home, I was thinking about the car and where we could get the car's brakes fixed. I didn't want to drive that car anywhere without the assurance that it was safe. I waited for my dad to come and pick me up,  completely forgetting  that I had to submit my Log Records.   To make matters worse, I went on my Rest Days. The Logs were due on a Thursday, and I was on my Day Off! Unfortunately, there are no exemptions to the rule.   No Log Records, No Pay.   That sucked...   BIG TIME!!!   And to think I have to pay 3 Bills this month, besides my daily gas, toll and food allowance!   Anyway, I can breathe a little bit easier now since my Manager assured me that the Pay I am supposed to receive at the end of the month will be credited to my July 15 Paycheck. Yipee! Hopefully, I can pay everything up by that time!

       That is my occupation on my  urlLink Friendster  account.   Why?   I am not sleep-deprived, nor is it by choice. There is a perfectly logical explanation to it... I work the Graveyard Shift. Well, that is, until July 4th.   I work in one of the biggest Contact Centers here in Makati. I handle the travel concerns of some of the wealthiest people in the Philippines. Calls rarely come during my shift, but it could still screw a person's body clock really bad.   One of the things I really hate about the GY Shift is my Rest Days. Although they may seem longer, it doesn't help my body clock much. It actually adds to my irregular sleeping patterns.   You see, on my Rest Days (which are on Wednesdays and Thursdays), I sleep at the "Regular Time," which is around 10:30PM and wake up at 8:30AM. This screws me up on a Friday, when I have to go to work at 9:00PM. I am awake the whole day of Friday, so when I get to work I am often drowsy or sleepy.   Well, my Co-Workers and I share the same problem. And since we hardly get any calls, we tend to sleep off half of our shifts! Oftentimes, people are surprised that we sleep at work! Not that our manager really minds, she doesn't! As long as we answer the calls that come in, it's fine. It's a nice trade off.   At least, when I drive home from work, I do not feel drowsy or sleepy on the wheel!   I just hope I can get a more Regular shift next time around. July 4, come fast!!!

       Yesterday, June 19, 2004, my cousin gave birth to a 7 pound 11 ounce baby boy who they named Jude Matthew Corpin-Madriaga. He's the long-awaited baby in the family (after my cousin Izabella was born in 1998). The first great-grandchild of my Paternal grandparents.   I was not surprised by his birth since I dreamt of his arrival just 2 days before. In my dream, Ate Mhin (my cousin) gave birth to a very healthy baby boy with a head full of hair, beautiful round eyes and a cheery disposition. When I woke up, I immediately asked my cousin if she already gave birth and told her about my dream. She wished my dream would come true since they were praying for a boy for their first-born. And true enough, they have an adorable baby boy!   The birth of Matthew was not easy for both Matthew and Ate Mhin, though. Matthew's umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck, which prompted the doctors to perform a C-Section on my cousin. It is said that babies born with their umbilical cords around their necks are intelligent and extremely lucky. I hope it's true!   Another cousin (Ate Mhin's brother) sent us a Multimedia Message with a picture of Baby Matthew. He's such a looker! Very much like the baby in my dream. I am looking forward to seeing this little bundle of joy. However, they are staying in La Union (a province in the Northern Luzon) right now, and it will take us around 5 hours to get there.   I know he's going to be a very pampered baby since all of his aunts and uncles just could not wait to dote on him! I hope he grows up a well-mannered, God-fearing and cheerful man.   Hmmm... When would I have a baby of my own?!? Hahaha!

       Okay, let's start the ball rolling.   I've been following the NBC Reality/Makeover show   Starting Over   these past few weeks and I've found it very interesting. Never, since my   Real World: New Orleans   phase, have I been so into a Reality Show. There must be something about this show that really caught my attention.   I saw this show one very sleepless night, as I came home from work.   Starting Over   is being shown on a Local UHF Station here in the Philippines at 1AM (with Replays at 5PM). Since nothing good is on cable, I watched, for an hour every night, as 6 very diverse ladies try to make a resounding difference in their lives, with the help of 2 "Life Coaches."   At first, Andy caught my attention. She was your local drama queen. She was very aloof towards her housemates, which started the tension between her and housemate Nyanza.   As the show wore on, I found myself looking forward to seeing the struggles of Lori. Lori is a young woman who is having an extremely hard time moving forward since the death of her husband. Hers is a very tragic story. Tragic, yet romantic. I could totally identify with her.   Lori seems to me, is like a sheltered flower - afraid that the sun and rain would harm her. She is horrified by the idea of establishing social relationships with people outside her family. Like me, she finds comfort in social gatherings involving her family. Her goal was to cultivate lasting friendships as well as finding a new man to fill her life.   I also found myself in another Starting Over housemate, Christine. Christine's Life Goals in the House was to lose weight and find happiness outside of her relationship with her teenage daughter. At first, she was "flying under the radar," so to speak. I didn't know what she was in the house for, or what her goal was. That was until I noticed that she was given assignments to post an add at Yahoo! Personals and she started running with a Coach/Instructor. Man! Now she's the person I can GENUINELY identify with. I need to do what SHE's doing!!!   How I wished there was that kind of show produced here in the Philippines. It could really help a lot of us "mixed up" people roaming around the Metro. I could certainly use the help and the emotional nitpicking!   My dream thing, now, is to meet these women and tell them how much their stories, triumphs and struggles have affected my life. I mean, I am totally seeing myself learning from them and from what they're doing. Cheesy as it may seem, but this Reality Show is just so inspiring! Go out and watch it!

       Today is the start of my new life...   No... Not   THAT   drastic of a change. I just thought that I ought to do something about the things going on in my cerebral cortex. So why not publish them on a BLOG?!?   I've been meaning to write a blog for the longest time. It just seems that writing a Journal is not enough. Or maybe, I've just been so darn lazy to write something on a notebook.   Anyway, here's to the start of my new life!

       I had the   Weirdest Weekend   ever!   First off,   my   "weekend" is not the same as everyone else's. My weekends are Tuesdays and Wednesdays (for the whole month of July). So that's one of the weird facts (except for those who work in Contact Centers and 24/7 Operations).   But, what made my weekend extremely bizarre (at least, for me) was that everything seemed to go wrong!   Last Monday, as I ended work and started my weekend, I found out that my car had been towed! That sucked big time! I was unable to move my car to a Pay Parking area because I was stuck on the phones. I couldn't go out to move the car except during my Lunch hour (which I took at 1:00pm). However, instead of doing so, I  had  to use my Lunch Hour to pay numerous bills and go to the Bank. So when I finally was able to go down and move it, it was already gone!   Good thing I remembered that one of my Dad's cousins was a Barangay Council Member. I called her up and told her what happened. She agreed to help me, after much lecturing. So I went home on a Shuttle which was,&nbsp;for me, better than driving home.   Early the next morning, I went back to Makati to meet with my Aunt who accompanied me to where the car had been impounded. She gave them the Towing Ticket, which had already been signed by the Barangay Council Chairman. After they checked on my License and Registration, they released the car to me without having to pay the usual PhP1,000 fee.   Everything went on smoothly after that. Or so I thought.   The very next day, Wednesday, I woke to find that we had no running water. I checked on our Pressure Pump, to see if it was turned on. It was not. Usually, if the Pump was off, the water could not be stored in our Overhead Tank. I called my Dad to see if he turned it off. He said that he did because the Pump's motor had been running the whole night and yet there was no water pressure coming in. He had to shut it off or else the fuse might pop. He asked if I had paid the Water bill, to cancel out the possibility that out Water had been disconnected. I had already paid the current water bill, so it was out of the question. Then, I checked the Water Meter outside of our house. It was gone!   I immediately went to the Waterworks Office to ask what had happened. Why our Meter was taken. (They usually take the Water Meter if your service had been disconnected). I told them that I had already paid our bill. The Engineering Department of the Waterworks told me that they had not Disconnected our service and that there have been numerous reports of stolen Water Meters in our area. We have just been victimized by these unscrupulous Meter thieves!   I called my Dad to tell him about what happened. He spoke with one of the Engineers there and asked if we could have our Meter reinstalled in a different area. They made arrangements for the Meter to be replaced and reinstalled, and everything was settled.   That was my Weird Weekend. Well, most of it anyway.

       Last night was the BEST! It was just like Christmas and New Year's all over again!   Our family rarely gets together since most of us graduated College. But last night, we had a small get-together when my cousin, Ate Mhin, and her new family (her husband and new baby) came to visit.   Ate Mhin got married last year, and since she and her husband, Ernest, moved to Cainta (near Antipolo), we rarely saw her. So rare, that most of us never even saw her Pregnant!!! And when she gave birth last June, to a healthy baby boy  (see my BLOG Entry on our new nephew&nbsp;  urlLink   Matthew    ) , she was so far from where we all lived (about a 5-6 hour drive North of Manila). So, no one from our family really saw this NEW Family, until last night.   They came back to Manila just last week, and we took the opportunity to organize a mini-get-together dinner.   I picked them up straight from work and we headed to our Aunt's house in Parañaque.   When we got there, most of our female relatives were there (our Grandmother, our Aunt and 2 other cousins). Of course, everyone was excited to meet the new baby and greet the proud parents! The house seemed to be in a buzz while everyone marched into the house. Everyone was cautious not to go near the baby if they had coughs or colds, etc.   Slowly, the other relatives arrived. Ate Mhin's dad, Tito Ray, arrived with&nbsp;Ate Mhin's&nbsp;youngest sister, Yan-yan. She's just around 9 or 10 years old. Tito Ray has been looking forward to last night since he learned that we will be having that get-together. He hasn't seen his Grandson since he was born, hence, the excitement.   Then came our other Uncle and Aunt, Tito Dave and Tita Mildred with her mom. Tita Mildred and Tito Dave have been struggling to have a baby since they got married, but they are still holding on to their faith that the Lord will bless them with a Child in HIS time. For the meantime, they are extremely elated about the new addition to the family.   We now have 2 Babies...  Izabella Cristina  (who is turning 6 years old this year) and  urlLink  Jude Matthew  . Izabella is the youngest among the cousins, born with a 15 year gap from her sister, Aissa. She was our  "baby"  for the longest time, and now, she's the   "ATE"   of Baby Matthew.   The get-together was rather fun, with everyone hanging out and catching up on each other's lives. Doting on the baby was another highlight of the evening. Most of us, even the usually jealous Izabella, wanted to hang around the baby, watching his every whimper.   As the night progressed, me and another cousin, Mae (Ate Mhin's sister), talked to Ate Mhin&nbsp;about having Matthew.   She told us what she went through while pregnant with him. She said that her neck, armpits, knees and tummy became dark and she had developed stretch marks on her abdomen. While she didn't really have any unusual cravings while pregnant, she said she was quite irritated with her husband. Hahaha! Poor Ernest!   It was quite nice to have the family together like that. Catching up with each other, joking around, talking about politics and food, etc. It would've been more fun if the family was complete. A couple of our cousins were indisposed of (2 were in the US, the other 2 were at work, and yet another was in Laguna) and&nbsp;our other Aunts and Uncles&nbsp;are also in the US.   Oh well, I guess that time will also come soon enough.   Today, they'll be having Lunch together in our Aunt's house again, but unfortunately, I would not be able to go since I have work until 3:00PM. *sigh*   I took a lot of pictures from last night and posted it on  urlLink  Snapfish.com   .

       The past few evenings, I've been having Asthma Attacks while asleep. It's so bothersome, that, at times, it prevents me from going to work the next day (to think I have to wake up at 4:45AM). The worst attack was last Monday morning (around 3AM). What made it   really   worse was the realization that  I left my Inhaler in my office drawer . I had no medicine available in the house!!!   I finally decided to go to the Emergency Medical Clinic that afternoon to consult with a Doctor (since my mom was out of the country). The doctor became concerned when I told her that I hardly get any attacks, until these past few evenings. She recommended that I take some medicine to widen my airway before bedtime&nbsp;and some   STEROIDS  !!!   I was concerned at the sound of Steroids because I know that once you get into steroids, you'll have to maintain it or you'll experience some unwanted side-effects. The doctor, however, assured me that I should not be concerned about the side-effects since the medicine,   Medrol   (Generic Name: Methylprednisolone), didn't have any, and it was to be taken orally.   At the Clinic, I&nbsp;also took some Ventolin via a Nebulizer. That medication cost me! I had to pay PhP310.00 for it! Good thing I had some cash with me at that time. After that, I had zip!   It was all good, though. I was able to sleep well the next few evenings... Until this morning. I had a slight attack while I tried to sneeze, as I woke up. It eventually faded, but I was still concerned. I just hope that after I take all these medicine, I will be able to sleep comfortably again.

       I've never been to a Planetarium.  &nbsp;  Can you believe it? I'm about 2 months shy of my 25th Birthday and I still have not stepped a foot inside a Planetarium... Ever!  &nbsp;  I distinctly remember a time when my family was driving by the Rizal Park and I saw the Planetarium. I asked my dad to bring me there, and he said he would. Well, it's been a lifetime (of sorts) since, and I have never even seen the building up close.  &nbsp;  Most of my friends asked if I'd be willing to take on a stiff neck. Well, I'd be willing to, given that it would truly be an experience. (Not that I'm an Astronomy buff or anything).  &nbsp;  Living in the City, I have never really learned about the stars, since&nbsp;city lights obscure the night sky. Whenever I watch movies with people looking up at stars, identifying each constellation, etc., I become quite perplexed as to how they manage to identify and find these heavenly bodies.  &nbsp;  I would really want to be acquainted with the heavens so that I could also navigate around with the stars as my guide.

         I think I am an Anti-Social  .   Weird, huh?!? I'm a perky, spirited person, yet   I   view myself as an Anti-Social.   Why do I think so? Well, let's just say that being a  homebody  turns you into one. Maybe, it's also because I have set a whole lot of limitations on myself that hinder me from being a Social being. Though I am  straining  to break free, it seems like I can't.   I have come to this realization months back. It's not that I don't have friends or anything... I   have   a lot. It's just that, sometimes, I just couldn't relate anymore. It seems like we walk on different planes, with different levels, and I could reach them. This is why I hardly go out on social get-togethers. Catching up has never been my forte. Unless it's on a one-on-one basis.     For example  : I've been to 2 get-togethers this past week. The first was a   Lunner   (Lunch/Dinner) Date with one of my Closest Friends in my professional life. The second was Dinner with 2 of my former  "Lambs"  just this evening. And all I can say is:   I am such a bad company.     Don't get me wrong. I  enjoyed  the Lunner with my friend, Nabsie. It seemed like we never lost touch (it's been more than a year). We were still making each other crazy. Or at least,   I   was driving   her   nuts! Haha! That's the way we've been.   Cariño Brutal   is the name of the game. I'd always be teasing, and she'd always be the victim. I don't know, but we had a lot of fun. We're just like kids!   The Dinner with my  "Lambs"  is a whole   different   story. No offense to Czacza and Lia, but I was at a loss the whole 2 hours we were together. I felt that I did not belong in that table. I can't blame them. It's been roughly 5 years since we've met, and a lot has changed since I got in touch with them last (They've been in touch since). We also have a 2-year age gap, and we run in different circles.   Though I seemed misplaced and disoriented, I was   still   glad to see them. What's more, is that, I just feel so blessed that these 2 people are still close, despite the fact that they were mere strangers before the YLSS in St. James, which brought us all together in the first place. I felt blessed because, in a way, I became one of the reasons why these 2 became close.     Misplaced. Oblivious. Estranged. Introverted. Austere. Isolated.   I feel that a lot lately, especially around friends who I've lost touch with for some time.   Getting plunged into a situation where I am   "obliged"   to socialize is uncomfortable to me. I feel so vulnerable to my feelings of rejection and dissociation. I feel that the more I engage in a conversation, the more I don't make sense.    Aaarggh!! Somebody help me, please!!!

         I HAVE A LIFE!!!     &nbsp;  In the past few years, I have let a lot of things (and people)&nbsp;take over my life. Things that, in the long run, did not benefit me well. More often than not, it gave me unbelievable grief. I became very desolate, withdrawn and I even started to secede myself from situations and conversations that had anything to do with the people or things that have burned me in the past. It made me think that, maybe, I didn't have a life beyond those things or people.

       Just wanted to congratulate my sister, Pam, on her Capping today!!!   My sister is in Nursing School right now (her 2nd degree) and will be going through this ceremony for Nursing Students. It's very much like a graduation ceremony, except that she's not graduating yet. The school officials are going to install my sister into the Nursing world by donning her with a Nurse's cap.   So, Congratulations, Pam!!!

         I LOVE ITALIAN!   -- Italian Food, that is! (Got you there! Hehe!)   I actually had Pizza the other day. It was a New York style Pizza: Big, Tasty and Filling! It's so different from the more "commercialized" pizzas that are available in the market. I don't like Pizza Hut or Shakey's Pizza, but I love the ones that come from Sbarro, Yellow Cab and Brooklyn. I could also settle for the Pizza that you can buy at your local Price Smart.   My personal favorite is the White Pizza from Brooklyn. It's a made with different types of White Cheeses. It also has a hint of garlic, which makes it more tastier. Mmmm! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.   But the Pizza I crave for the most is the Chicken and Garlic Gourmet Pizza from Round Table Pizza. Mmmm! They don't have Round Table Pizzas here in the Philippines, so I'm just dying to have one right about now!   Food has been my passion for some time now. Isn't it obvious? But I am trying to cut it down to a minimum. When I've been good, I reward myself with a slice of Pizza.   Another Italian food that I just   LOVE   is Pasta. Ravioli. Penne. Fetuccini. Tortellini. Those pasta noodles are more delectible with Authentic Italian Sauces. Puttanesca. Amatricianna. Arrabbiata. Carbonara. Pesto. Aglio e Olio. Neapolitan. Formaggi.   Since I was a kid, I loved spaghetti and lasagna. But until I tried my Aunt's Puttanesca, did I crave for more AUTHENTIC Italian Cuisine. I still, up to this day, have not cooked your usual Spaghetti Sauce (ground meat in tomato sauce). I've been cooking and experimenting with a lot of different sauces to find the perfect taste. Hopefully I can find one that is just perfect.   Now, I'm hungry!!!

       At long last! I am now living a   NORMAL   Life! For a month, at least.   Today, I started my 6:00AM-3:00PM shift at work. It's not   THAT   Normal for most people, but at least I'm awake when everyone else in this Time Zone is!   It's not that hectic as I presumed it to be, but it  is  quite interesting.   On my way to work, I saw dawn start to break. The darkness giving way to the light. Poetic! Well, at least to my mind it was. The setting was not romantic. Unless you think the Highway, pothole-ridden streets and towering skyscrapers are romantic, that is.   I haven't seen the sun rise since my carefree teenage years or on Summer Vacations. It's quite a refreshing sight. I just got used to the darkness a lot. Well, it kinda dominated my life for a while. Literally, and figuratively.   I hope that as I see the sun rise on my way to work, I could also feel the light pierce through my dark days.

       For the last few days, I've had pestering headaches, allergies and colds that have dampened my otherwise satisfying day.   I had already consulted a doctor for my headache, which he has diagnosed to be Vascular in nature. He gave me some prescription drugs to take for 3 days, which, stubbornly, I did not take. My headaches have since subsided, but last night, a heavily pounding headache plagued my evening at work. Fortunately, I was already in the office when my headache started. I took some Mefenamic Acid to numb the pain, and slept it off while at work.   Another ailment that has been bothering me are my allergies. 3/4 of the day, my eyes are raw, itchy, swollen and watery. Almost like conjunctivitis. I try to put some eyedrops to ease the itchiness, but when I wake up, my eyes are still watery and itchy. I've been suffering from this kind of allergy for approximately 5 years now, yet I have not yet adjusted to it. Who would?!?   Having colds, for me, is as common as taking a bath... Literally. Whenever I take a bath, I get colds. Weird, but true. It eventually goes away, but it's always there.   Hmmm... I wonder when that day will come when all these "diseases" leave my body. Hmmm...

       I've been on my Rest Days these past 2 days and the semi-highlight of my "weekend" was food and babysitting.   Ahh, yes...   FOOD!    Glorious Food! Hot Sausage and Mustard! While we're in the Mood, Cold Jelly and Custard...  Wait!!! I'm getting carried away here...   Anyway... On my way home from work last Wednesday morning (June 29), I was famished, not having eaten my dinner and all. Since we were experiencing the last blows of a raging typhoon, I thought it was the perfect weather for some "old fashioned" hot cocoa and some hot pandesal. The perfect breakfast food for an otherwise gloomy and stormy weather. Good thing the bakeshop I buy pandesal from was open early. I bought a couple of freshly baked bread and some milk. Champorado, I thought, would've been more perfect, but then again, I already gave up eating rice (and was too lazy to cook).   When I got home, I proceeded to cook the hot cocoa. Since it was the "old fashioned" one, I had to boil the cocoa and add the milk and sugar ontop of the stove. It was well worth it. I had a great breakfast! Yummy! I also shared it with my dad when he woke up. Unfortunately, my sister had early classes and was already out when I arrived.   I spent most of my Wednesday feeling that I ate a lot! I swear! Gluttony is an ever-present temptation and feeling everytime I go on my Rest Days. Since I don't do much when I'm at home, I just cook up something and eat whatever esculent provision is available. Although I eat moderately in about 1 1/2 times a day, I feel like I've consumed a TON of food, and it sickens me.   Thursday arrived after 14 hours of slumber. You read it accurately... 14 peaceful, accumulated sleeping hours. I felt deprived of sleep the previous day, so I retired to bed early, waking at mid-day. For brunch, I decided to have Bacon and Eggs.   I loved eating Bacon and Eggs. It reminds me of eating at Denny's and IHOP. Whilst cooking the Bacon, the oil that emanated from the Bacon fat splattered onto my right hand. It actually burned 3 spots on the back of my hand. At first, I thought nothing of it, but as I cleaned my hand from the hot oil, I saw 3 separate reddish spots that stung. These reddish spots have since turned into a dark brown color, much like bacon. Now, I think I would rather stick with the other "safer" cold cuts.   Right at this very moment, almost 7 hours after my last meal, I still feel supremely glutted. I can literally feel 5 lbs. adding onto my weight. Hopefully, I am just imagining things.   My life is anticipating normalcy in the next few days, as my new Working Hours are set for the Early Morning and Mid-Afternoon Hours for the month of July. I am looking forward to eating normally, though still in a reasonably moderated fashion.

       I am severely peeved at my father, right now. (Was there ever a time that I wasn't?!?)
