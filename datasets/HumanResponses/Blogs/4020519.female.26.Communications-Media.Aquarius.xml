      Salamat talaga at may internet na rin dito sa bahay.  Dati ko pa gusto mag blog kaso alangan naman gagawa ako habang nasa office e super busy ko dun.  Testing lang kung may magvi-visit at magbabasa nito.  Kahit wala, okey lang din.  I do this as my way of putting to writing what I have in mind.  Testing lang din, malay mo there is someone who knows me who is searching for me.  But they would really find it hard to get to read this but I hope they would.  Kaso ndi ako yung tipo na ibo-broadcast ko na i-check out nila ito.  Testing lang talaga kung may magkocomment. Sana meron akong kakilala tapos mabasa ito.  Ang saya talaga na malaman na binasa nila. Ndi man sila magpakilala at least i-acknowledge lang nila na nabasa nila to. Kahit testing lang... =)

      Nagtry ako sa ibang blog site. Kainis! Pag-preview ko ng blog ko bago ko i-upload kainis nawala ba naman, ang haba pa naman nun. Kaya sabi ko dito na lang talaga ko sa blogger.  Pagkatapos ko ba naman magtype type di ba tapos nasayang lang.  Kakawalang gana tuloy.  Pero siyempre ako yung tao na nilalabas sama ng loob gaano man kababaw kaya ito ako ngayon. Basta blogger na ako. Dito na lang ako magpo-post. Ang babaw ng pinagkakainisan ko pero ito type type pa rin.    Kaya talagang dapat ako mag-practice ng Zen.  Ewan ko kung ano ba talaga yun.  Pero okay talaga yung book ng Zen and the Art of Falling In Love.  Kaiba kasi dalawa na ang book ko with the same title.  Pagkita ko nga sa book na yun sa Powerbooks akala ko iba lang cover pero iba author kaya sabi ko ano kaya pinagkaiba?  Kaya ayun siyempre basa basa.  Buti na lang may vacant na space kaya nakapagbasa ako ng 1 chapter. Magsasara na Powerbooks kaya sabi ko sayang naman kung hindi ko pa bibilhin ang book na yun. Bihira pa naman ako may mahiligang bilhin na book.    Kaiba ako mamili ng book kasi.  I like going to Powerbooks and read any book I find interesting pero, madalas hindi to the point na I will buy it.  Saka kaiba, I feel as if something, maybe my subconscious mind or God is leading me to pick a book and scan it if it is worth buying.  It is really a wonderful feeling once I got to pick a book that I really like.    Ito pa yung book tungkol sa Zen.  This is something new that interests me nowadays.  I hope it is really good.  I've found some interesting Zen centers sa internet na located dito sa Manila.  Pero I am quite apprehensive if I will visit those Zen Centers. Bahala na.  Pero kung may kakilala ako na magyaya sa akin dun pupunta ako dun.   I am happy that I've found something new to learn and try.  Balik na ako sa pagbasa ulit nung book hanggang sa makatulog.

      I am reminded again of a guy I met almost two years ago.  There are really times that he just pops up in my mind. But just thinking about him really makes me happy.  I don't know how he is now.  I know I still care for him though I don't know him well.  Just meeting him makes me understand a lot about myself.  I know that I have a lot to settle in my heart.  I know God has a purpose why I've met him. That guy made me realize that my life should not be centered in one guy. He taught me about letting go.  That letting go is hard but one should do it because that person has a life of his own.  That no one can force one even if you like the person a lot if that person does not find you interesting too.  He made me realize that people just come and go.  But people still remains in your heart and leave a certain feeling when that person enters your mind.    I hope we can have a cup of coffee again. He is just one person I've met that I've got no connections with. He is not a friend of a friend.  He is not related to me in any way.  He just comes into my life and he left without any sign of coming back.  I don't know if I'll ever see him again. But he still makes me think about soulmates and stuff like that.  He makes me think about relationship and how lucky I am with the relationship I've got. I don't know whom he is looking for if he has found her already because everytime I've got a news from him he  has a new relationship. I don't know but I am still attached to him in a way.  I guess he is already a part of my life.  I don't know what makes me think about him now.  But I hope wherever he is he will soon find his way to the direction he wants to go.    I just don't know but I've got a feeling that I am not welcome to enter his life.  It seems he is pushing me away.  But I want to be his friend.  But I should not be selfish because he has a life of his own and I am nobody in his life.  I don't know what makes me think about him again.

      Sa ngayon ewan ko ba kasi napapaisip na naman ako kung gusto ko na ba talaga tong work na pinasok ko.  Malapit na akong mag-2 years, ilang buwan na lang. Pero kontento naman ako sa company na pinapasukan ko pero ako ndi ako kuntento sa performance ko. Ewan ko sabi nga ng dating HR dun sa 2nd work ko nung nag paalam ako na mag-resign maybe I am being too hard on myself. Pero kasi minsan sa dami na ng pending ko feeling ko ayoko na gawin yung antagal ko na pinapa-quote tapos ndi pa rin yun ang appropriate na i-P.O. Kasi kung pwede ko lang gawin lahat para matapos na lahat yun.  Ang kaso siyempre as a Purchaser dapat sigurado ka na bago ma-i-finalize, the order must meet your requirements. Ewan ko ba ano na gagawin ko, ang dami ko na pending tapos sa araw-araw yun na lang ng yun. Tapos siyempre may new requirements na dumarating. Hanggang natatambakan na ako.  I know I must act now. Gusto ko maging efficient at productive naman ako sa job ko.  I want to be contented about my output.  I want to go home feeling that I have accomplish something.  Saka siyempre ayoko na naaapektuhan iba dahil siyempre gusto ko anuman request nila I can act on it as soon as possible.  Alam ko nasa tabi ko lagi si God.  I know that I am not undergoing thru this alone. Basta I hope tomorrow, I can be more focus.  Salamat at may weekend na pahinga =)  [ urlLink View Guestbook ]  [ urlLink Sign Guestbook ]
