      					 Moments   			Once when I was walking sanely, 				I remember the times when we were alone.  			Both were quiet, never talking much, 				But we seem to know what's in both our minds.  			Oh, the moments when we stopped and looked at one another, 				Was the moment when I know we're meant for each other. 			Can we go back in time, can we hope for last time, 				I'll never forget you, and hope you never do.

      					 Sometimes   			Sometimes life is full of honey, 				Always sweet and never changing.  			Sometimes life is full of oranges, 				Sweet and sour, never knowing what you'll get.  			Sometimes life has ups and downs, 				But if you take it with a smile, 			Then you can be sure that life is just a whole load of fun!

       Chapter 1   The wind blew strongly and Mei held on tightly to her windbreaker. It was just after school, and students were rushing home for warmth.  Pheew. The wind blew once again. Mei shivered for a while and then quickened her pace. She had to be home before 3pm, or get scolded by her mother.  Han Meiyin was her full name. She was born in Sri Lanka 13 years ago. That was not her birth mother, it was she, Yuun, who adopted Mei.  Since young, Mei already accepted the fact that Yuun did not treat her with equal respect to her children, Chon and Lenn. While her two children ate rice, all Mei had was some leftover food from the day before.  Not that she disobeyed Yuun or anything like that. It was the fact that when Yuun adopted her 10 years ago, at the age of 3, Yuun brought Mei to see a fortune teller to tell her fortune, whether she would bring luck to her.  The fortune teller at that time had said that Mei would be un-luck to Yuun, because their 8 characters clashed, meaning they would quarrel over trival things.  At the age of 4, Mei had already knew the fact that her adopted mother did not favour her, but because Yuun believed that she would get retribution if she threw an innnocent child away, Yuun decided to keep Mei with her after all.  "Mei! Over here!" Mei turned her head back and saw Jun, a guy from her class, waving to her. "Meiyin! Wait for me!"  Mei hesitated, wondering if she should wait for Jun. If she did, she would risk being late home. But if she did not..  Before she had an answer on her mind, Jun was already standing beside her. "Want me to send you home, Mei?" Jun asked, with a friendly smile on his face.  "If.." Mei hasn't got the words out of her mouth yet when Jun grabbed her hand tightly and ran towards Mei's house. On the way, Jun asked Mei whether there is any homework for today. Mei was going to reply when she heard a familiar voice.  "Han Meiyin." Mei stopped in her tracks and looked up. Yuun was there, with a cane in her hand.

      Yawning&nbsp;in the early dawn, Looking out and then I fawn.  Trying so hard to&nbsp;have friends, In the end I cannot mend.  Where's the voice that's supposed to be mine? When's the day that I will turn fine?  So many troubles in my mind, Can I softly speak my lines?  Then the daylight starts to break, As I see the people wake.  Can I ask you for a dime, Will you give me one more chance?

      As she turns 39, and her features are still fine, It makes me feel that she is mine.  Every single day, as I wake up to pray, I know that there is some place watiting for me to stay.  Home, is where I am, Here, is where I land. The place where I make friends, Is where I'll always defend.  Though I may leave somday, But I'll always be sure to say, You always find a way, To let me have my ray.  Singapore, where Home is the Best.  Dedicated to Singapore for her 39th Birthday.    Happy Birthday, Singapore!
