      I found the blog of one of my ex-coworkers tonight. We had lunch today and she still wouldn'y divulge where her blog was online. Finally, the truth came out. She had written about me in her blog with her earlier suspicions when she first started that I was an Asian Gangter. Anyone who knows me knows that I am far from your typical Asian stereotype... at least I hope so. Anyway, here is her  urlLink blog .   urlLink    murphy sleeping at 7 weeks  urlLink

      So I'm still watching Google, waiting for it to push $120 /share. Which I think it is very capable of in a week. I mean how can people not expect Google to be succesful. Everyone uses it for just about anything and everything. Is there any other name out there in search marketing other than Google? No one ever says, "Hey just Yahoo! it!" or "Hey MSN it!" It's always, "Just Google it." I'm a web developer and even in my programming needs I just Google what I'm looking for and can always find the answer. Or at least it leads me to the answer. Google is about as sure as thing as ice in the arctic.  So I got plans for a camping trip for Labor Day weekend with my girlfriend and my puppy. We're going up to Lake Isabella which is part of the Sequoia National Forest just before you get the National Park. We're both pretty excited about this because we both enjoy the outdoors and can't wait to see how Murphy adapts to the wilderness. He loves to explore and just the thought of him smelling all the scents of nature is somehow invigorating.   urlLink    murphy at 7 weeks, his 1st night with us  urlLink       urlLink    murphy at 7 weeks, the next day  urlLink

      I am now a proud owner of Google. I have always wanted to buy a stock that I personally use and have faith in. Ever since I shied away from buying Abercrombie stock for $12, now at over $33, I made a solemn pact that the next IPO that I felt a real connection to that I would buy it in the beginning. Well I bought it today at $103 and it closed at $100. To me, I just feel Google stock is the safest investment out there. Maybe one day I'll have a chance to work for them. Now that would be cool!  Now for the uncool... so I have been carpooling with this freak for about a month now. She is the worst driver I've driven with, lacks social skills, is incredibly inconsiderate, and flat out weird. The stuff she says and does seriously is a wonder to me.
