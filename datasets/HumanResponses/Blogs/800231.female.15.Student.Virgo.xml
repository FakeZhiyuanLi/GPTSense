      I shouldn't have been making fun of contact lens training, *hangs head in shame* I failed... How sad is that? I have to go back on Monday. Apparently my instinct to blink when something goes for my eye is a bit stronger then most peoples. Everytime I got that bloody contact close, my eye was like "Dear God! She's finally gone mad!" and snaped closed for a good minute... Jeeze, in the course of two weeks I've discovered I can't make an omelet or put a contact in, I'm barely human.  Dad, mum and I went to REI tonight in the absolute pouring rain. Why? Because my dad decided he had a random need for thermal underwear...

      I'm confused and slightly depressed, but that is pretty much my normal state. Ever had one of those days where you're convinced the entire world hates you? I have a lot of those... Maybe I should be on Zoloft like my dad. Severe depression is probably hereditary. Blah...  I actually had a pretty good day yesterday. It was my mum's b-day so we went for a really lovely dinner. Also, I finally got a new camera for my photography class. All I had was the typical point-and-shoot set-up so I got an SLR type. I set out with a $300 budget because that was all I have in cash. (Give me a break, I'm in high school.) Anyway, I found a nice Nikon N55 for on sale for $230. After at least an hour in the camera shop I had racked up an extra $120 in supplies I didn't think I'd need. Camera sales people can be tricky... My mum had to pay off the extra $80 bucks I didn't have but she didn't seem to mind.   This morning I managed to lose my cell phone in my own coat... Amazing, I know. I may be going more insane then usual...  My optometrist doesn't seem to trust me, tomorrow I have two hours of "contact lens training school". Now, I know this takes a bit of time to figure out but OVER TWO HOURS? Jeeze, what fun.

      My day was interesting enough. God, I hate my new block classes though. They placed every last person I despise in them, now I have to deal with these people for several hours everyday. Oh well, suppose I'll survive...  I knew it, Mr. F is even more tragic then I thought. Steph, Casey, and I were all there together. Steph was downloading ringtones for her phone and was trying to ignore Mr. F's introductory speech. Anyway, she started signing the "Inspector Gadget" theme song and he had a bit of a spaz attack: Mr. F: Put that phone away! I-I'm pretty, I'm pretty l-" Steph: "You're Pretty?" F: "Lenient! I'm pretty lenient!" All three of us: "OH!"  The class is truly beginner though. Halfway though the class came a sudden scream of "What the hell is that?!" Mr. F: "That would be a computer, Peter." "Oh..."  Lucia and I spent the entirety of lunch convincing Helen that tutoring at our old middle school was a bad idea by telling her about last year. Now, our school was great, actually one of the best in Seattle, but it definitely had its problems. Most of them involved my little group though... Anyway, Lucia and I spent the last three months of school taping random notes to teachers cars. Mostly things like "May the fleas of a thousand camels infest you armpits!" but we thought it was funny.

      I'm so bored right now. It's a three day weekend thingie and I have absolutely  nothing  to do. Oh well.  I have to get contact lenses on Tuesday, I've had the same glasses since the 7th grade but I've rarely worn them. Anyway, they're all bent from being dropped and stepped on and occasionally abducted by my cat. I figure contacts are my only chance at being able to see properly...  I was looking forward to Mid-winter break until I looked at a calendar this morning. I'd completely forgotten that I was getting my wisdom teeth taken out then. On the plus side, large amounts of heavy duty pain killers are involved so at least I'll be delirious and happy that week.  My dad is a pain in the ass, he's rude to everyone. He went off on a little girl selling candy in a supermarket yesterday. Who in there right mind swears at a little girl?! God... He is even more horrid on weekends though. I spend all week relatively happy and then he comes along and starts telling me I'm useless or a bitch and that's the end of my happiness. He and my mum had a huge fight in the middle of a store a few weeks ago. You see, my mum is currently out of work but we are in NO way struggling for cash as my dad seems to think. Anyway, he pitched a fit when my mum suggested we go to a local Thai restaurant. After 20-30 minutes of yelling and swearing about being poor he bought $90 worth of expensive cheeses and beer.... Would someone please explain how that one conserves money? Besides, beer doesn't really go with fine cheese. Some people have no taste... So today, he decides we can't eat out and proceeds to go on a long tirade on saving money. My mum has just bought me at least $200 worth of clothing this week plus we eat out nearly every night. With this going on, I highly doubt we're that tight up for money. Thank God I only see him two days a week... *shakes head* He's just gone out for a pizza. I don't eat pizza, I haven't for several years now. He's purposely trying to make me angry. I don't care, I'll find my own food.  I wanna go take a really long bath, maybe that'll take my mind off things.

      So, I passed my aerobics final. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, just extremely long.  The new semester starts Tuesday, I'm almost sad to see the last one go. My block classes are all getting split up and I'll miss some people. Oh well, its not like I don't see them outside of class. I have photography this semester, that'll be fun at least. I've also been signed up for a tech class. I was going to test out so I could do something more interesting with my time but Steph has the same class and I'd like to spend more time with her. So I guess I'll stay. I went up to the tech room today with Helen and Lucia because they were both going to test out. Anyway I met the teacher Mr. F. What an odd guy, I'm not really sure what his issue is yet, suppose I'll find out on Monday though. He showed a pretty large interest in Lucia though. Helen was talking to him and he just got completely distracted by Lucia and started asking her a bunch of random personal questions. This went on for several minutes before he got distracted once again by Helen and me. I was looking for a dollar in my bookbag and Helen called me a 'homeless person' for some unknown reason. Finally, someone harasses Lucia instead of me. I swear, I'm not very pretty but for some reason I'm creepy-ass teacher bait. I hate that, my 8th grade counselor used to grab my butt every chance he got. Thinking back there's at least four of them that sexually harassed me. What is wrong with me?!  I got a ride with my mum after school because I was to lazy to wait for the bus, cell phones are useful things. I get in the car and she says, "I cleaned out your closet today." I thought that was alright until I got home and found out that her definition of "cleaning" was taking everything out of my closet and throwing it on the floor. Good lord, I took me an hour to sort though everything and get it back in my closet. Why do I get the feeling she doesn't like me?

      Janet and I may be the only people on the planet that cannot make omelets. Part of our project involved a food presentation involving resources from our planned diet. So we attempted to make a soy omelet this morning. So twelve eggs and a pound of Soy cheese later, we know we're complete failures in life. Seriously, Theo, Janet and I all brought in the ingredients before school and went up to the cooking room. Theo is the only member of our group that can actually cook anything at all. Unfortunately, he refused to cooperate because "soy is bad". So after telling Janet and I the basics of making an omelet he stood back to watch. It took ten minutes and the help of another guy before we could even get the bloody gas stove on... I told you we sucked. Anyway,to make a long story short, we burned it and spent the rest of the day warning people not to eat it.  I have my aerobics final tomorrow, sounds amazingly stupid but its  really  hard for me. Bah.  I was released from my ceramics final a hour and a half early, I should've just gone home but I had plans with someone later so I decided to stick around until classes were over. God, its so boring just lurking around in the halls after class. I was sitting on the steps on the east landing when some random teacher sat down next to me. He was very confused to say the least. The first thing he asked me was where he was. Then he asked me if he could leave soon, when I told him I didn't know he just sat there and stared at his watch. LOL, I hope he was a sub. When I finally got up a few minutes later he said "bye" quite amicably and last I checked he was still sitting there staring at his watch.  A while later I caught up with Steph and Casey who apparently left class. They were lurking around the pop machines in the gym hall trying to scrounge money off people. Steph has been absent so much this quarter the she has to appeal for credit. That involves getting a paper signed by all your semester teachers saying you actually worked while you were there. Only problem was, the papers were due into the attendance office yesterday and Steph still had hers. The last teacher she needed to sign it was her band teacher Mr. S so we spent 10 minutes tracking him down and eventually found him in the AC hallway. Anyway, Steph ran up to him and started the heavy duty begging for credit.  "Please? If I fail my daddy will kill my doggy and then he'll kill me and I'll hold you personally responsible!" Mr. S just stared at her, but he finally agreed to sign it. Then no one had a pen. I managed to find the last working pen in my bag after ages of looking and handed it to Steph. "I love you Angela!" Mr. S turned to look at me. "I love you too! Wait... I don't know you. But, I'm sure I love you anyway!" LOL, this made me laugh, I don't know why...  Helen just got a tutoring positition at my old middle school. Problem is, Helen never went to my middle school and its an   extremely  confusing place to get around in. It isn't built like any normal building I've ever seen, anyway I've promised to go with her on her first day to help her out. The last time I was there was last September when I went to visit some teachers that I still consider friends. Anyway, this'll be fun! I've always loved that place...

      I have my math final tomorrow, yippee?   I have a huge project for Science and Health that I'm getting nowhere on. My group (Janet, Theo, me) spent the entire day talking about random drivel. Not kidding, apparently twinkies may survive the apocalypse... Anyway, it counts for a huge part of our grades so I have to spend all my tutorial time on Wednesday and Thursday working on it. Great, I was looking forward to going home early. Oh well, the project itself isn't that hard, our group just doesn't work well.

      I got my second semester schedule today. I actually received four copies of it today, all of which were different. Someone is seriously trying to mess with my head here. How did my schedule change fours times in a matter of 3 hours?! As I told Lucia last year, there's definitely a note in my records somewhere that reads "Drive her insane, it's easy and hours of fun!". Jeeze, it took me 20 minutes after school just to get a bloody appointment with my counselor for tomorrow. Plus, during mentorship this morning I got some random letter from the principal. Get this, my mum has signed me up for a UW study. Apparently it's on how "High School affects people socially and emotionally". Somehow I don't think I was the best person to choose for this study... I was already insane, this place does nothing for me. I spent the last three years in the most bizarre situation possible (i.e. my middle school).   People keep telling me I have to dress up for the Martin Luther King Jr. Assembly tomorrow.  Why exactly would I dress up for an assembly? I know, respect MLK and all but still, the tux's the seniors have to wear are seriously overkill. It's in the  GYM  for gods sake! Besides, I dress well enough, it's not like I'm walking around in ripped jeans or anything.  The finals next week sound hideous. We only have 3 classes a day, but each class is over two hours. Plus we have a tutorial period in the morning and afternoon which is basically free time. It's supposed to be for studying or asking for help from teachers but Ms. Davis says we can just go home instead. I rather think I'll go for that option.

      Yet another day of mass stupidity. Amusing mass stupidity though. We were burning peanuts in science today. We were supposed to be finding the calories in them but most of us were too amazed by the tiny peanuty-fireballs to actually do anything useful. By the way, burnt peanut is a hideous smell and it hung around in the science hall all day. Bluggh...  I walked into health today to find my desk halfway broken, the top part was broken at one corner and hanging down onto the seat. Anyway, I pulled it up and started turning it around to see if I could break the entire thing when Helen walked in and burst out laughing. She ran over to Sophal who was standing a few feet away from me but hadn't noticed me. Helen said "Hey Sophal! Look at Angela's desk." Sophal: "I don't wanna look at Angela's desk. I'd rather look at her..." Me: "My what?" S: "Err, hey look your desks broken!" Pfft. After that he went over and broke the entire front off of my desk. Ms. N was pissed to say the least. Hah!  I had an hour and a half of ceramics today. Blah, normally fun but since were closing in on midterms (next week. arrgh!) we don't have any new projects and I just finished the last one on Monday. So I was bored for an hour and a half. On the plus side, I did all my homework for the day. Then I just sat around reading and listening to the insane people that populate my class. Ceramics at my school is a pretty strange course anyway. At the beginning of the term we had to sign contracts that specifically stated that we could not make any thing remotely resembling a bong or a penis. Of course, someone immediately made a bong with penis designs. Oddly enough, Mrs.K dubbed it "a beautiful piece of art."(!) We pretty much gave up after that...

      All bow to Angela, I've just finished my health essay. I feel so proud right now. *grins*  God, Steph told me the stupidest story during lunch. It was pretty random even for her, I was just sitting there eating my blueberry muffin when she came out with this. "When I was 6 my cousin made a celery penis..." "What?" "He made it out of tape, glue and celery... Then he ate it." At this point, everyone in our group was staring at her. "He got really sick though. His mum took him to the doctor. The doctor was like 'what did you eat?' and my cousin was like 'I ate a celery penis!' and the doctor was like 'A what?!' and he was all 'I made it with tape and glue...' that's why he's in counseling..." Jeeze, I nearly choked to death on my muffin, she said it with a completely straight face too.  Kinda had to be there.

      I wrote my rough draft last night... Correction I wrote  half  of my rough draft last night. No matter, we had peer editing in health today. Lucky me, my peer edity-person was an absolute twit. He had absolutely nothing to say, not even sure if he read it. Oh well, wasn't done anyway.  Still, what a dufus.  My cell phone started vibrating during ceramics. I figured anyone calling me in the middle of class probably had something pretty important to say. I was definitely wrong. Ceramics is a pretty free class so I went outside to the porch on the outside of the ceramics building and answered my phone. Turned out to be Steph reminding me that I was her bitch... Not even kidding, what sort of person calls someone to tell them that? Not even surprising though, she had been telling me that most of lunch.   Today was weird anyway, people I didn't even know kept talking to me. Creepy, eh? Nothing rude about it, just random people starting conversations with me. You have to understand, most people don't just approach me like that. Then again, the people who know me say I stand out quite a lot. I'm actually really tall, nearly 6ft... That probably has a lot to do with it. Today I actually got over my fear of wearing high heeled boots. Yay for me! So what if the heels were only 2 inches. I'm still proud of myself. *grins* Anyway, I digress. Why are people talking to me? I know its a good thing but  I'm seriously not used to it... I was sitting around reading an Edgar Allen Poe book today and people kept stopping to talk about it. Whoa...

      I'm supposed to be writing an essay right now. Obviously I'm not. I'm one of those people that  has  to do major projects at the last moment or they just aren't any good. Last year I wrote a 20 page term project at 11pm the night it was due and got an A.(!) The teacher that graded it had specifically told us that it was impossible to throw together a paper like that and get an A. Showed her...  Anyway, I did a bit of research for my essay today but I don't feel like writing the rough draft right now. Screw it anyway, its only for health and the rough draft is barely worth anything. I did do my science homework though. Go me.  A very large tree limb crashed through our fence last night, it was pretty spectacular. It snapped right through a 6ft chain link fence, trust me that takes a lot force. Our  lovely  next door neighbors showed up at our door this morning to inform us of two things  1) The broken fence takes away from the beauty of the neighborhood. 2)The tree (which is at least 100 yards from anything they own) somehow endangers  their  lives. Keep in mind that these same people have in the past called the fire department on us on Christmas smoke was coming out of our chimney. Needless to say, my dad told them to bugger off.

      Note to self: Painting one's nails at the computer is a very bad idea, for quite obvious reasons. I must stop doing that...  So, I went to school today. Amazing, right? The second I walk into Science this morning I get my lab partner Gabe screaming across the room at me. "ANGELA! I haven't seen you for weeks! Speak to ME!" God, I'm missing for one day and evidently people think I've died. Oh well, I sat down and we actually argued over where I'd been on Monday. I was in class, he disagreed and Mrs. C had to step in. Good Lord... Apparently Gabe had been absent the week before winter break and had missed a major test which he had to make up this morning. This was a bit of a problem because some people I know from our academy were gathering around to speak to me. Helen, Kaeli and Brienna were standing around our table chattering about something and Gabe was screaming at them to shut up. The struggle went on for several minutes before we shut up and stared at each other. Of course, Sophal decided this was the  perfect  time for his entrance and ran over singing at the top of his lungs. Gabe started yelling at Sophal for "screwing him over" and forcing him to get a crap grade. Mrs. C had to intervene once again.  Ms. N AKA Satan attempted to touch me in Health. She seemed to think it was a friendly pat on the back but the thought of having IT touch me nearly made me cry. You do not understand how insane this woman is, she acts like she has some sort of mental disorder. She can go from normal-ish person to madman in a matter of seconds. She has occasional screaming fits with herself, even.  I was even more frightened when she asked me to stay after class, thankfully it was only inform me of a new essay and not to kill/maim/eat/hug me...

      School apparently  was  in session today. I actually woke up at 1:30PM today, that would be an hour before my school day ends. At least on Wednesdays and Thursdays. See, I go to THE most f'd up school in my district. They randomly decided last year that they were going to run on a completely different schedule then all the other public high schools. Hence, all middle and high schools but as run from 7:45 to 2:15 and have six class periods. We on the other hand run from 8:45 to 3:00 on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, and 8:45 to 2:30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays. That may not sound too bad but they also screwed with all the periods. We no longer have homeroom *whimpers* this means I have to actually do my homework at... home. Errgh.... Also for some incomprehensible reason, we don't have second period. This doesn't make any sense, our periods go 1 3 4 5 6... Why not just go in order? Why lose 2nd? Anyway, I'm rambling here. My school is stupid...  I have not done  anything  today. Nothing whatsoever and I'm proud. I'm going to school tomorrow though, Fridays are OK. I'm supposed to be doing geometry homework right now. I refuse, I'm failing math though or I was. My mentorship teacher couldn't believe I could be failing anything and promised to yell at my math teacher. I can't wait to see the outcome.  No one has tried to contact me today, I fell so unloved. My mummy is barely speaking to me to, what'd I ever do to these people?

      OK, This is it. This is bloody ridiculous. The electricity in my neighborhood has been off and on for hours now. It came back after two hours out at a 11 o'clock or so. The last time I was in the middle of walking down the hall to the bathroom and managed to slam into a wall. Now my nose hurts. Bah. My dads at work so I'm stuck in here with my mum. She's been dithering around lighting candles... then leaving them in the worst possible places, like on top of counters with papers all over them and one about a foot off the ground on my guitar amp. The sad part is that while she was doing this I had been putting battery powered lanterns in actually useful places. Good lord...  Anyway, during the last power outage I was lying on my bed attempting to read by flashlight when my cell phone rang. The conversation went as follows: "Hello?" "ZWITTER!" (German for Hermaphrodite. Lovely way to introduce oneself...) "Errr..." "Relax, It's Alice. Is the power out in your house?" "Alice, the normal way to greet someone would be hello..." "Ich ben ein zwitter..." "I'm sure. Anyway, the powers quite out. Do we have school tomorrow?" "Probably not, wanna do something?" "Yeah, why not..."  God, there we have it, I'm not going to school tomorrow even if it is open. Thursdays at my high school are extremely strange anyway. Block classes are only 20 minutes long. After that I have an hour and a half of math followed by an hour and a half of Aerobics. Yeah, count me out on this one. I think I'll stay home and sleep.  Anyway, I must hurry, I think we're due for another outage. Night...

      I need to get started on this thing. I'm so unorganized right now, feel like crap anyway. At least I'm kinda lucky: this is the week after winter break but I've only had to actually attend school once this week. Thank god for giant snow stormy-things.  Apparently this is the first one we've had in a decade. It was actually quite lovely yesterday, loads of powdery snow everywhere. Unfortunately, this is  Seattle  and it rained... a lot. So everything is all slushy and crap today. Uggh... it's no fun now, can't even drive in it so I'm stuck in my house doing nothing.  I woke up this morning and everything was dark and cold, REALLY dark and cold. Needless to say I spent several minutes very confused... and cold. Then my Mum wandered into my room, "Good morning, the powers out." and then she left. Just like that, now I was even more confused. So I went to find my parental type people to explain, it was 10AM and the electricity had already been out for 8 hours. Peachy. Anyway, I tried getting back in my bed but my two rabbits and my cat had already taken over. Bah, they have fur and they still steal my bed. This whole power outage thing really screws with everything though, My mum and dad had already showered and had used all of the hot water. For some reason it didn't occur to me that water heaters run on electricity. Genius, I know. Stepped into shower and nearly died, that was possibly the most exciting part of my morning...  Anywho, the bloody power in my house did not come back on until 1:30 PM. By then my house was near arctic conditions on the inside. This played hell with the tropical fish in my house.   Prior to the power coming back on I was trying to amuse myself by watching the world outside through the window in my room. It looks out over my backyard and the tiny private road behind my house. Anyway, I was watching one of my neighbors attempting to dig his car out of the slush. Now this guy needs some introduction, he's very very strange but he's  gorgeous . I'm not kidding here, I'm also in luck because he's a friend of my dad so he's ALWAYS around our house. There is one teeny tiny problem though, he's 21, I'm 15. Sadly enough, I've got a much better chance with this one though, My last major crush was 32 and errr... my history teacher.....

      I lived. It wasn't as bad as it sounded at first. I have to say that the worrying before hand was a billion times worse then the operation itself. Then again, that's probably how things like that always go. Anyway, this is one day after and pain is VERY minimal. The vicodin has seen to that. I did get a bit nauseated after the general anesthesia yesterday. Vomiting with wounds in your mouth is not something I ever want to go through again. I'm much better today, I look like a chipmunk cheekwise but I feel fine.   Alice and Stephanie called earlier to ask how I was doing. Well, Alice called to be nice, Steph just wanted to see my chipmunk cheeks... Oh well. I'm surprisingly hyper for someone on giant amounts of vicodin. I wonder is that's a bad sign? At least I have an excuse to sit around for a few days eating ice cream and playing video games. Every cloud has a silver lining ya know.

      I have to get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow. *cringes* God, I know 90% of people in this country go through the same thing but I'm really scared. Any sane person wouldn't make a big deal out of this. Not me, I started fucking crying earlier. For some reason I have HUGE issues with the whole procedure. Everything about it is hideous. The fact that an IV needle is involved scares me even more. Isn't there just something freaky about having your body pumped full of drugs to make you lose consciousness? My wisdom teeth haven't even erupted yet, meaning that the surgeon has to saw through my gumline and jaw to get the teeth out... The *best* part is, this is in NO way a necessary procedure. The three teeth that are developing are coming in perfectly straight and have enough room. My orthodontist is just being an arse. Even my dentist said this wasn't needed but he seems to think he knows better. Fucking A... I may just run away, I don't need to waste my entire mid-winter break being puffy and in pain.   My parents seem to think I'm superior to other humans because I only grew three of the bloody things... Right, if I was more evolved I wouldn't have developed them at all. Would've saved myself a lot of pain. Anyway, Alice called me a few minutes ago to assure me that I wouldn't die. Like she knows anything.   I'm only 15, I'm to young for this. I despise my orthodontist... He's just doing this to be mean. I'm glad I bit him when I was eight. He deserved it.

      I feel like killing someone, seriously. We had to sign up for next year's classes today. I  was   supposed to move up to Math 2 next year, but Ms. B is trying to put me in 1.5... She flat out called me stupid to my face, told me I was struggling. Fuck her, I'm haven't even been trying but, I'm certainly not struggling. So what if I don't do anything in class, I was the only one who aced the finals! She should've called me lazy, at least that was true. By the end of our little discussion she was giving me that "You're a fucktard so I'll go easy on you" look. I was two seconds from piercing her jugular with my teeth... Unfair, I think I'll change my schedule form, nothing stopping me.  I spent 2 hours of my afternoon sitting on the front lawn of our school listening to the orchestra practice. People insulting me affects me far too much. Last year some kid insulted me in the hallway and Steph and I slammed him into the lockers so hard the back of his head was bleeding. I've become far too violent these past few years, I hate hurting people. I have a very fragile ego and I just lose it when someone goes too far.   Besides the whole math issue everything is good. I was in a camera store tonight looking at random eqiupment when some guy approached me and asked me for my opinion on some of his shots. Guy had the coolest picture ever, it was the sun setting over an ice covered lake. Totally spinky! Anyway, he thought I made a good call on his shot. I love photography... Maybe could be a professional some day? My teacher seems to think I have talent.

      Ever seen a TV explode? I got to this morning in first block. Ms. L just got a huge new TV as a replacement for her old 13" type TV. Anyway, Ms. L had the new TV on a rolling stand and when she tried to move it this morning she just knocked the entire thing over. It made this huge "KABOOM!" noise and the screen just disintegrated into dust, smoke and lots of broken glass. We all just sat around stunned in the smoke while other teachers in our corridor came in to ask who'd been shot. Yes, it was that loud. Then one student pointed out that the silver dust leaking from the screen was probably carcinogenic and we should leave. So as we're all walking out the door Ms. L stops and asks her student teacher to stay behind and sweep everything and LEAVES him locked in a room full smoke. Who else thinks that was incredibly cruel? We came back 50 minutes later to find him kneeling in broken glass and choking. Ms. L is such a sweet person...  I think its a bit of a shame that John Kerry has been such an unstoppable force among the democratic candidates. Out of all the candidates I liked him the least. I know he's more likely to win against Bush but still, Dean could've been so much better for the country. I think it's time for a bit more change then Kerry is offering us. Then again, I can't legally vote so my opinion doesn't matter. Bah.  I was in a book store earlier when I got a call from Helen. She wanted to know what the homework for LA was and I had no idea. All I knew was that we were supposed to be reading the last chapter of  Siddhartha .  Eventually we figured out that we were supposed to be answering some random question on the meaning of life. Helen was trying to tell me what happened in the last chapter so I could help her do her homework but she was really confused. Finally she asked me why Govinda just gets up and walks away from Siddhartha and I said rather loudly "Cuz Govinda 's a poo!" and everyone around me just turned to stare. I feel special...

      Went to Eckstein with Helen, Lucia and Alice. Eckstein being my old middle school of course. It was actually a trippy sort of experience, not because I haven't been there for a while but because everything seems to be falling apart. Not the building but the way Eckstein used to be seems to be gone. When we graduated a whole bunch of older teachers and the principal of 14 years left with us. The new principal seems to have either changed things for the worst or lost control completely. It's very strange in there now, trash and graffiti is everywhere. One of the teachers we talked to today told us that the new principal is extremely strict and the entire atmosphere feels strained most days.   I was at Eckstein for a photography project, if nothing else its an awfully interesting looking building, with the right light it makes a pretty good picture. Especially the old choir room, the sun sets directly into it making a very lovely, shadowed scene. The current teacher in that room and I were trying to figure out the vintage of the sound equipment, evidently there hasn't been a choir class in there since the late 50's or earlier. Anyway, there is some pretty spinky stuff to photograph so I'm happy. :)  Helen showed up today looking dead... Her eyes were bright red, it was pretty freaky. I mean it was ALL red; eyeball and eyelid. I dunno what happened to her but, damn. I should've been the one with red eyes today. I could not get my contacts in this morning. I sat around poking myself in the eye for 20 minutes before the bloody things finally went in. Good lord.   My hair is so dry that it was actually making crunching noises earlier. I'm disappointed in it, I've been waiting months for it to grow out so I can dye it again and now this. What did I ever do to it? Besides dying eight different colours? The problem was the two times I dyed it black, the stuff will NOT come out and it takes forever to grow. So I've been sitting around for the last hour with super-conditioner in my hair. Not the funniest thing ever but my hair stylist claims it'll help. Suppose I should wash it soon though. Ah well, I'm off to do it now.

      God, Photography was insane today. I had a finished roll of film that I was putting off developing because I was completely unsure of the whole procedure. Mainly because that first guy that tried to walk me through it was insane and didn't know what he was doing either. Anyway, I decided to get off my arse and actually do something today. One of the advanced students had been asking around for someone to teach so went over to  the counter he was standing at. It was only supposed to be one beginner per advanced person but he ended up with three, me and two other guys. He had managed to procure a huge reel container though so all was good. The only problem was that the two other beginners were absolutely incompetent to put it lightly. Well, that and our teacher-dude had the strongest accent ever and we could really only understand him when he was insulting us (which was pretty much constantly). Anyway, we were standing down in the darkroom waiting to use the smaller film loading room off to the side and teacher-dude was going through the steps of loading a reel. It was quickly pointed out that I the only other person that knew what she was doing. The other two beginners were far too busy trying to figure out why they couldn't see colours properly, in a room lit only by amber safety lights. Jeeze. Anyway, when we finally got in the film room and the lights were completely out all hell broke loose. Loading film reels involves locking yourself in the utter darkness and using things like scissors and pliers all while handling very delicate film. Definitely not a good thing to be doing while trapped in a tiny room with three other people. Anyway, passing the scissors around was a laugh, one kid stabbed himself in the hand, nothing serious just funny. I got my film canister open fast considering I'd never done it before. Problem was, I dropped it and had to spend several minutes crawling around in the dark looking for it. I did finally get it and load it though, way before the others. Anyway, I was leaning against a wall waiting for the others when I feel hands feeling about my breasts. "Vat is this?" (obviously teacher-dudes voice) "That would be me." "Oh, I thought so..." And then his hands just stayed there, I kid you not. No apologies, nothing. Just his hand... on MY boobs. How amazingly embarrassing. I feel so violated.

      I had a really bizarre-ish day yesterday. I ended up back at school yesterday despite the fact that my cold was worse then ever. Blah.  Alice, Helen, Lucia and I were sitting in the band room hall during lunch. We were talking about last semester when Ms. N was giving a random lecture on STDs. She was going on and on about how people with STDs were not bad people and ended up sharing a bit too much about herself. She told everyone present that she had genital herpes then tried to cover it up by saying, "But I didn't get it from my husband! I got it from school...". Of course, the whole class started backing away from her. I'm not really sure I want to know what she meant by that.  I think I broke myself in Math. Alice, CeCe, Maija and I were working on a quiz together. About 30 minutes into class everyone was pretty quiet and concentrating on the quiz.  I muttered "Father figure sex." without realizing I was actually talking. Leave it to me to disrupt perfect concentration with something absolutely... Different. Luckily, only a few people around me actually heard what I said and we all burst out laughing. Alice and I were practically crying by the end of class. God, don't even ask what I was thinking about.  Tech class was absolutely hilarious, Stephanie and I spent the first 10 minutes complaining about how hungry we were. Finally Steph ran over to Mr. F and screamed "Me and Angela have to PEE!". Surprisingly he let us go. So we grabbed some cash and went downstairs for a snack. We spent ages raiding the vending machines, they're very generous with the free food. I don't know why they haven't been fixed but a dollar can get you  everything   in the machine. It just keeps spitting the dollar out until you have everything. Quite useful. We made our way back upstairs with more junk food then we could possibly eat, dumped most of it in the room and went back outside to find Steph's friend Ben. He was actually in his class for once. Steph opened the door to his class to get his attention but couldn't distract him so she slammed the door shut and we took off down the hall back to our class. She was wearing flipflops, so you hear "SWISH FLOP SWISH FLOP" echoing though the entire hallway. We ducked back into Mr. F's right as a very angry teacher burst out of Ben's class and stalked off screaming about disrespect. Mr. F didn't even notice our absence. How sad is that?  After school I had to go home and put my contacts in. I'm not supposed to wear them at school for the first week and I discovered why today. I was at the mall with my mum when my contacts decided to attack me. Not even kidding, they want me dead or blind or something. It was horrid, my eyes were watering everywhere. Gah, I finally managed to get them under control but looked like a doofus. My eyes were all puffy and red. I decided to find some heavy duty under eye concealer stuff, so while my mum was in the Bon I walked up to a random cosmetics counter and was seized by a scary make-up counter lady. "Hello! Can I help you?" "Yeah, I was looking for an u--" "Under eye concealer?" "Yeah, actually.." Anyway, this lady grabbed my head and applying things to my face. In the end I managed to spend $30 on the smallest tube of concealer ever. But, at least it works really well.

      I'm so very very bored right now. As usual, I haven't done a thing all day. I woke up this morning with the worst cold known to man. Just my luck. Anyway, I went back to bed and slept 'til noon. My throat still hurts like hell though. Ah well...  I'm supposed to be going with Helen to her tutoring job on Tuesday. She's with my 6th grade math teacher on Tuesdays now. Apparently she mentioned my name and he really wants me to visit. At least someone misses me.     urlLink       I have nothing more to say. I'm off to find some herbal tea...

      ARRGH! So much bloody homework! 'course, I'm not doing any of it, for now, perhaps later. Should do something anyway.  I was standing was walking to my next class after tech when Steph ran up all excited and asked if I'd seen her sunburn. I was looking at her face and it looked a bit red but not too bad. So she proceeded to remove her shirt in the middle of the corridor. God, that was the worst sunburn I'd ever seen. Blurggh. How do you manage to get a sunburn only on your breasts? I would've asked her but I was trying to avoid further embarrassment.  Some dude in Lucia's 6th period starting speaking in tongues and making bizarre prophecies today, apparently he didn't know he was doing it and it scared the hell out of Ms. L. Of course, they weren't   normal  prophecies, they were all things like "Someone will throw catsup at the computers!" and "You will find your mozzarella on the ceiling!". But still, he could be a prophet, you never know.  Ah well, I should do something productive now. Or sleep. Whatever comes first.

      I'm so bored right now. I'm in Tech and I just want to leave! Dear god, nothing's happened for ages. Well, we've actually been taking some random test. I finished but Steph can't figure it out and Mr. F has been yelling at me for helping her. Poo.  Obviously the Mexico cruise people are back. Alice can barely walk and keeps falling down the stairs. She hasn't slept for a week because of the cruise and she leaves for New York in two days so it looks like she won't be sleeping for another week. I laugh at her misery...  I AM SO BORED

      At home, calm. My friends forced me to visit a guy I know cannot stand me earlier. They don't know about it and that's the problem. He still bothers me, he really shouldn't. Anyway, enough of that.  Helen, Lucia and I were at Eckstein this afternoon to help with tutoring. Mildly fun, in a school sort of way. Saw this kid walk out of the band room cuddling and kissing a tiny puppy. Made me realize that not everyone sucks arse there. Thank god.  Steph's whole issue with her parents has been sorted out, she was really the one at fault there. She called the police on people that were only trying to help her. Typico.  Alice and Steph coming back from Mexico tonight, something to look forward to.  Tired, need to write 842 culminating projects. Well 3, but still. I'd rather sleep.  Helen called a bit ago and we ended up watching "Wheel of Fortune" together and guessing the answers over the phone. We are such losers.  loveliness. :)

      I really don't know why they're dragging me back there to see him. I guess my friends don't really understand what this means. It sounds so stupid but it's true. Oh, I don't want him to yell at me again... After all I've done to erase him, I'm going back. It seems almost like I'm going home, revisiting the building and all. I'm scared, not of him, of everyone there. Lucia and Helen seem to think that my fear is some sort of joke. It's not, I don't need to feel any lower. Let him be nice for once! Pretend to care, or at least don't show you hate me. God, let him have missed me.

      Random no school day, can't remember what the occasion was. Anyway, would've been boring but I spent three hours on the phone with Helen. I should have known how the conversation would go when I picked up the phone and she screamed "I'm NOT high! I'm just really up there today, ok?!". She couldn't understand why the couch kept throwing her across the room. Well, and she wanted to read me a preschool book about ducks that she had found and decided was the best thing she had ever read. I don't even know what she was on but it was pretty damn amusing.  Other then that I spent the entire day feeling like scum. I was cutting one of my house rabbit's nails today and cut into the quick. God, there was blood everywhere, even after applying 800 pounds of styptic powder. I felt like such a fucktard. He's ok now, it looked a LOT worse then it was. Thank god.  I really need to contact Steph but I have no way to do so. She left her cell phone at her real house and I don't know the number for her foster people's house. I really hope she's ok.

      So I finally know what happened to Steph. Apparently she snuck out of her house while she was grounded a few nights ago. Came back at three AM only to find her dad waiting for her. They got in to their usual screaming and swearing fight and Steph's dad hit her. Steph freaked and ran away and ended up at our friend Lorna's house. Steph told Lorna's mum everything that happened and she called the police. Now she's back in foster care, this has happened before so Child Protective Services is looking in to abuse charges. Steph isn't allowed to go back to her house until the investigation is over so she has barely any clothes or other personal items. Life sucks major ass. I was eating lunch with Steph today and she was crying half the time, I didn't even know what to say. What can I say?   On a lighter note, my children's book turned out really well. We has a sort of open presentation of them today and Sophal's friend told me my book was "hella pimpin". Excuse me? Can children's books be hella pimpin'? Ah well it's a complement, I should leave it alone.

      Going insane, or at least more so. My stupid children's book is taking bloody forever. I'm taking a well deserved break right now, been working for two hours straight. Plus, I feel lonely. The rest of my family has decided to desert me. So have my friends. They all eat poo anyway.  I haven't seen Steph all day, I miss her. *Waves hands wildly* I love you Steph, come back! I wonder where she is anyway. Maybe I'll call her later. Alice said she spent the entire day crying her eyes out, God knows what's happened now.  My parents left for dinner an hour ago, they left me without food. I don't care if I'm perfectly capable of making my own food, its just bad manners.  I'm so tired and hungry. See ya later...

      I woke up angry at the world today, how sad is that? Seriously wanted to kill everyone though. As Alice pointed out earlier, I've been making sarcastic or otherwise cruel comments at everybody today. Even called my math teacher a "hemorrhoid in the rectum of humanity" when she refused to give me my missing assignments, needless to say it didn't really help. Oy vay... I'm such a moron.   I have to get my ass in gear on that kid's book thing. It's all written now but I've barely started on the illustrations. Bugger.  Mr. F touched me. *shudders* Alright, it was only an hand on the back sort of thing but still. Steph wasn't even there to scare him again, she only showed up for the first few minutes of class and then left. I couldn't go with her though, it was a test day and I can't afford to miss any major parts of that class.  Bah, I'm tired of the planet. I'm off to work on my book... Wish me freedom from my boredom.

      Today has been such a very long day... Good lord, the bell rang in first block and I thought school was over. Really. I've felt so lazy all day too. Pah. I need sleep, but I can't, have to work on crap.  It was initiation day for the new cheerleaders today. Evidently making an ass of oneself should be a part of every cheerleaders life. 'course, they  are  cheerleaders so that's sort of a given. Anyway, initiation involved forcing them to wear garbage bags and toilet paper for clothes before they could join the squad. So they all showed up wearing garbage and no make-up. Steph and I were laughing our asses off at them. Helen took it a step further at lunch, she poured salad dressing in some cheerleader's leather purse when they weren't looking. Lucia, Alice, Helen and I barely made it into the halls before we burst out laughing.  Talking to my dad a few nights ago when the subject of 4th grade camp came up. My dad used to volunteer for the school district when I was in elementary school and he used to help with the annual school camping trips. In the fourth grade my best friend was a boy named Brian who lived with his uber-bitch grandmother, Dorothy. This lady hated me and my dad for no reason. So one morning at camp Brian and I were eating breakfast together and his grandmother sat down at our table. I was doing my best to ignore her (which was hard because she was over 400Lbs) when my dad came over and sat next to me. And all hell broke loose in front of a table of 10-year-olds. Dorothy: "You can't sit HERE! Go somewhere else." Dad: "You know what the great thing about being an adult is? I can pay you to go fuck yourself, bitch. Why don't you sit somewhere else?" Dorothy (turning red): "I... never..." Dad: "Well, now you have. Now fuck off."  Everyone just sat around stunned. I love my daddy. :)  Steph scared Mr. F today. Someone was complaining about how much Tech class sucks again and Mr. F very loudly "I really love you all, but..." And Steph leaped up and kissed him on the cheek and screeched "I LOVE YOU TOO!" directly in his ear. You have to love Steph.

      Wow, it has been a freaking weird couple of days. Yesterday I got my interim progress report, everything was spinky except for math. It's always bloody math, I had A's and B's in ALL of my other classes. Of course I was pretty much expecting this, I haven't actually done anything in math all year, but still. Anyway, my mentorship teacher Mrs. C saw my loverly F in math and went insane again. You'd think it would be my parents that get made but nope, 'twas my mentorship teacher. Anyway, after several minutes of discussing how this would look on my record, Mrs. C decided to take matters into her own hands. She was going to go Mrs. B and try to get my grade changed. So there  are  pluses to making friends with the teachers! I expected her to email her or something, but as I was leaving school yesterday Lucia told me that Mrs. C had actually walked in during a class and interrupted Mrs. B. Then they stood around talking about me rather loudly in front of a class full of people that know me... There goes keeping my grades private. It may of actually made a difference though, I'll have to wait and see.  They've been having a school-funded "Rap Battle" for the last two days. Couldn't they find anything better to spend the budget on? We're in a district that can't even get the toilets fixed but setting up a very expensive three day show is perfectly acceptable? They've even found a few semi-famous people from around the city to preform. Of course, all of the school contestants are white guys with whiny voices... Great, eh? Then we had some guy who sounded just like cookie monster, when he was finished he was all: "All the gangstas in the house! Give it up!" *Crickets* "What? You guys musta not had breakfast or something..." Alice, Lucia, Breanna, Helen and I were laughing our asses off in the hallway. The guy left looking all confused and hurt.  I actually fell asleep when I got home today. I don't think I've ever done that before, slept from 3 o'clock to 5. So I felt like a total dipshit, but I feel rested.

      So I spent the last week trying to take the best pictures  ever  for photography class, went to parks and weird little buildings around town, worked really hard and what did I do today? I destroyed nearly the entire roll of film. Out of 36 pictures I have around 5 that developed properly, life is poo. Technically this wasn't my fault, remember the guy that molested me in the film room a few weeks ago? HE DID IT! I walked in the film room today by myself for once, so happy not to have anyone one bother me. I had just pulled the end off of the film canister when someone knocked on the door. "What?" "Who's in there?" "Angela." "Oh. I'm coming in." At which point I told him to wait until my film was safely on the reel and in the container, but after several minutes of arguing, he opened the door anyway... Moron. Luckily I was standing near the back of the room and only part of my film was exposed to the amber lights in the darkroom. Bloody hell, if that wasn't enough he brought a new student who he forced to do all of his film, meanwhile molester-dude himself stood directly behind me breathing down my neck. Of course, standing in total darkness with someone breathing on me was rather creepy and distracting. I had half of my film on the reel and was hurrying to get the rest rolled when he decided to "help". In other words he took the reel and after several loud whacking noises he popped it in the container and handed it back to me. Later I discovered he had slammed the reel into one of the counters in a sad attempt to load it. When I developed it the chemicals couldn't reach the film properly and that what happened to the rest of the roll. Damn him anyway, he grabbed my ass when I was walking out of class.  Otherwise my day was it's usual weirdness. Alice skipped French class to hang out with me and Steph in Tech. Steph was being unusually rude to Alice, calling her a freak and telling her to fuck off. Alice doesn't really fit in with most of Steph's friends so she was probably just embarrassed to be seen with her. The scary part was that Alice didn't seem to mind. I guess we've both learned how to deal with Steph over the years. She's actually quite nice and lovable most days.  Anyway, I feel better now. I'm off to find food.

      I'm so tried right now, unfortunately I can't sleep as I have mucho homework. I'm actually halfway done but I had to take a break. I'm supposed to be writing a children's book right now. Hah... Honestly, I don't think I'm cut out for that genre, the last thing I wrote was a not-so-short short story about a teenage girl in a very strange sexual relationship with a teacher. It's actually pretty good, if rather graphic. Several people really liked it though. Anyway, back to my children's book, the storyboard is coming along well but I still don't like it. Well, we'll see.  Steph and I skipped Tech today, she dragged me out into the hallway and she looked absolutely frightened. She handed me a note and told me to read it, I could definitely understand her fear. The note was from some guy who apparently took one of her jokes to far, he was going to attack her family. It got a whole lot worse after that but, I'd rather not get into it. Later Steph told me the other reason she needed to talk to me. She's bribing me to come with her to some drug party, her ex-boyfriend is going to be there and she needs me for emotional support. On the plus side, she's buying for me that night. I may go, or not. I have enough of my own problems, I don't need hers too.  Why do pretty guys always have to have personalities that suck major fundement? There's this uber-gorgeous guy at school that I've been staring at for months now, I haven't spoken to him much but he really comes off as a jackarse. Oddly enough, I was walking around a corner today and nearly slammed into him. I think I scare him, but I do run into him really often. Bah, he's too pretty...

      HUGE drug bust at school today. Whole butt-load of people I know ended up busted for weed. Seriously though, how was this not expected? Our school is known throughout the entire district as the stoner school. What surprised me was the fact that Steph escaped and Megan was caught. Megan never struck me as a stoner at all, whereas Steph proudly announces it to everyone. Wow...  Steph and I snuck out of Tech after attendance to get some food and talk. God, I've known her for four years now and she gets freakier every single year. The sad part is, I have this bizarre affection and loyalty towards her. She was the first real friend I made in middle school and that really meant a lot to me. The only problem is that we're very different people and I find that I have to change to keep up with her, it's at a point now that is frightening. I started smoking and drinking to be with her... I guess I've finally succumbed to peer pressure. I can't help it though. Bloody Hell...   Anyway, we spent 20 minutes downstairs and figured we should try to sneak back into Tech before Mr. F reported us dead. We actually snuck back to our seats without anyone noticing, which I think is a pretty good accomplishment. Of course we managed to attract attention in other ways. Steph pulled a strawberry condom out of her bag and asked everyone in the vicinity if they knew whether it really tasted like strawberries. Steph, James and I ended up opening it for a taste test. Mr. F walked by us, saw James with a pink condom in his mouth and did a total double-take. The looks of horror on both of their faces were priceless. By the way, tastes like a latex-covered strawberry, not bad though.   Not that my family is any better. When I asked my dad for words of wisdom I got, "It's not who you know, it's who you blow." Great, just what I wanted to hear from my dad.  I am sooo happy that it's the weekend. I love having nothing to do.

      Didn't to school today, what else is new? Actually, I haven't been at school a lot lately. Woke up with cramps from hell. I was quite surprised, I don't think I've ever had them that badly before. So, I took some Excedrin and went back to sleep. The only problem is now I have so many absences that I may have to appeal for credit. Oh well, no biggie.  My school has once again decided to show its individuality by giving us a holiday that no one else in the district has. Yesterday they called off school for no reason. I suppose I should be thankful but it was just bloody weird, probably has something to do with our new live-in superintendent. Anyhow, I had nothing better to do so I went downtown for shopping and photographing crap. It was actually really fun, we should have more random vacations.      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     urlLink Marriage is love.

      Wow, I've been gone for ages... I haven't really felt well lately, between the wisdom tooth extraction and a killer plague of the flu I've spent most of my time pretending to be dead.  The new superintendent has been lurking around our school for weeks, I wonder when he'll realize he has his own building? He put on a random talk about India today because he grew up there and all that lovely stuff. I was actually trying to be serious and listen because he's a pretty cool guy. Almost made it all the way through his speech too, then Helen kicked me really hard in the shin (with steel-toed boots too) and I ended up making an arse of myself as usual. I started swearing at her and everyone turned to look at me. Loverly.

      As usual, I am supposed to be writing a massive essay right now but I'm not. It's only a rough draft so who cares? As I've said before, I'm pretty good at pulling "A" papers out of my butt at the last moment.   I spent most of my day wandering around a Japanese garden. It was VERY lovely. I was taking pictures of Koi and stuff for class. Of course, being me I managed to fall off a rock and into a stream but it was still very nice.  School bad. Don't wanna go, but must. Bugger.  Woke up this morning only to find my backyard full of really hairy people. REALLY hairy people. Turns out my dad has started a bit of a motorcycle gang. A motorcycle gang that only rides classic British bikes. Like Triumphs and Nortons and things like that. Not that we didn't see this one coming but it's quite a shock to walk up on in the morning. Well, at least they have taste.  I'm soo very tired. What else is new?

      It's been another pretty weird day, but this time I've had much more sleep. At least I was awake through most of school today...  Mrs. N was her usual self. She was giving textbooks to a few people that hadn't received them yet and was shuffling notecards with student's names on them at the start of class. Shawn said quite loudly "Are you going to name us?" (in reference to the notecards in Mrs. N's hand) Mrs. N stared blankly at him for a bit before saying "Did you say anus?" "No, I said name us..." Mrs. N starts jumping up and down and screaming "ANUS? Did you call me an anus?!" "No! 'Name us!'" "Oh right. Yeah, whatever..."  Later we were talking about the differences between the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) . Halfway through a sentence, Mrs N. Stopped and started giggling uncontrollably "You know what? PNS sounds like penis!" and then she fell over from laughing so hard. How sad is that? Some health teacher.  Did nothing in Photography today, 'sept draw with some random kid. He drew me a lovely picture of a girl picking her nose though. Lovely.   More sleep good. :)

      Ugh, the start of another long, boring quarter. I'd forgotten how bloody odd Ms. N is. Towards the end of class she was bouncing on her computer chair and then switched to a sort of pelvic thrusting motion. During her humping of the chair she winked very obviously at Gabe. Not a joke-ish sort of wink either, more of a "See what I'm doing to this chair? I'd rather be doing this to you." sort of wink. Gabe just stared in horror.   Last night was horrible, I got a total of 2 1/2 hours of sleep. It was horribly hot last night, which is odd because its never warm at all here. At least not this time of year. So where the 88 degree night came from I do not know. The windows in my room are the double-window sort and since the outside ones had not been removed it was impossible to cool the place down. At 4AM I was completely prepared to march outside with a screwdriver and a ladder and fix this problem but my dad stopped me. Evidently he didn't want to pay the hospital bills that would have resulted. So I spent most of my night petting Harvey and reading. Bah. Lack of sleep had surprisingly little effect on my day though, nothing copious amounts of caffeine and make-up couldn't hide.  Alice is back from New York. She's bought me a t-shirt and a new watch too. Thank god, my last watch is still somewhere in Australia... Don't even ask.   Steph and I snuck into the lunchroom today, possibly the saddest thing ever. They should really stop locking it during classes though, people still need food you know. Anyway we snuck in through the kitchens, humming the theme song from "Mission Impossible" the entire time. The lunch ladies just shot us nasty looks though.  So, normal day altogether...

      Looks like this is going to be a strange week already. Yesterday I didn't even bother going to 5th period, I was just sitting in math thinking about how much I wanted to leave. So when the bell rang, Alice and I just left. We walked through the back fields and out to a woody little park across the street to sit for a while. It was pretty nice actually, we sat by the creek and contemplated the meaning of life. Which means I sat around playing with my lighter while Alice laughed her head off at nothing in particular. All in all, it was better than actually going to class.  Today I managed to pass out during math. Really, it was pretty odd, one minute I was half watching Mrs. B write things on the overhead and the next thing I know Cece is poking me in the back and telling me that class is over. I slept for nearly half an hour at my desk and no one bothered to wake me up. Not surprising though, Mrs. B knows that I only get 2 hours of sleep most nights after a time project we did. I'm an insomniac of the worst sort, I live on copious amounts of caffeine. Still, I've never just blacked out like that, weird...  Alice has just told me that my hair reminds her of a retro 70's sofa. Cheers.  If just noticed that Steph only tells me she loves me when she's stoned. I think I'm in an abusive relationship with a woman. She has spent a lot of time with her hand down my pants now that I think of it.   Helen and I have written a beautiful song on piano. Slow, pretty, instrumental, absolutely great. Even marketable, unfortunately our working title is "You Know You Want It Bitch". Doesn't really fit but it is a nice song. Actually, Lucia, Helen and I all write music. We can actually do some pretty good stuff when we aren't making asses of ourselves. Unfortunately, it's the stupid songs we write that our friends usually like. Some such examples:  "My Penis" "Pho-Na-Na" "Angela: Slut" "Move Like Moses" "I Don't Like You (So I'm Gonna Hit You with my Car)" and the infamous "My Penis (the Sophal remix)" Yeah.  I set a piece of licorice on fire during lunch. It's actually quite flammable. The teacher that walked by a few minutes later made me put it out though. Bastards...  I'm bored and way too hyper right now. I'm gonna go bounce off walls now. Bye!

      Life is good, I finally talked to my neighbor on Friday. My Dad, his friend Matt, and I were sitting outside on our patio talking on Friday night. It was pretty boring at that point, they were doing their best to leave me out of the conversation. Anyway, T. came home on the motorcycle that he borrowed from my Dad and walked into our backyard. When I saw him walking around the corner I was like "OH GOD!", I think he may have been thinking the same thing though. He sort of stared at me for a bit until Matt told him to stop being such a loser and sit down. Then he introduced himself to me, even though we both knew each other's names. Actually, I'd never told him my name so I was a bit surprised that he knew it. He's really sweet, gave me someone to talk to. My dad was right though, he's about as connected to reality as I am. We were talking about school/work stuff and he gave me the saddest excuse ever for not going to college: "I had a chance to go to a vocational school, which I really should have done, but all the chicks were buffer than me and that makes me feel bad..." Good lord... Then again, his weirdness was explained a few minutes later when Matt asked me something about my school and T. said "Whoa, you go to Hale? I went to Summit! I had a bunch of classes at Hale though." Yup, another Hale/Summit kid, could've guessed. Anyway, we started talking about life there and how strange it is.  "You know, I blame Summit for all my problems. Instead of learning something useful we just made things out of clay and paint. That's why I'm ignorant." So, he's great, really. I think it went pretty well considering I'm such an spastic loser. God, I hope we can be friends or something. He's fucking hilarious to talk to and he's pretty cute. This is a very good thing!

      Well, the gun situation was taken care of. I still don't know all the details though. Oh well.  I had a really bizarre experience this morning. The drama club decided to have a Day of the Dead celebration. So they dressed Wes as the Grim Reaper complete with scythe. Every 15 minutes he would wordlessly pull someone out of class to represent all the teens who die everyday from chronic head-up-ass disease. No, really. Anyway, I was standing by the science block landing this morning with Helen. I just happened to look down just as the Grim Reaper and Theo were walking up the stairs. Sadly enough, in my f'd up little mind this seemed perfectly normal and I just kept talking to Helen. It wasn't until Death and Theo walked directly in front of me that I fully processed what I was looking at. He was a very convincing Death by the way, tall, thin and the costume was very good. So I was a little freaked out. It was early and I was very tired so all I could say was "Helen, do you see that too?". Helen thought we were both going insane-er. God.  Ever listened to one of the phone sex shows? Those things are really crap. Someone gave me the number to one today so out of curiosity me and a few friends called on our cellphones. Really, two guys going "Oh yeah!" into a phone does not constitute sex. It was sooo fake. Bah, what's the point of phone sex shows anyway? There so much good porn on the internet... Yeah, I'm a perv.  Goodnight! I must go spy on neighbor. Err, I mean do homework or something.

      This is great. Summit School, the school directly across the street from us, is on lockdown. Evidently some wackjob with a gun is running around in there and won't leave. So Summit and all the streets and intersections around us are blocked off by police. Yet, our school remains completely open. Yup, they officially do not care about us. I was watching the police sneaking around in 4th period, Ms.B's class is on the first floor directly in front of Summit so I had the perfect view. Two officers were standing out in the middle of the street talking and I swear, this is word for word what they said.  "So, officers are moving in on Summit?" "Yeah." "Is the suspect still in the building?" "We don't know." "Shouldn't the school across the street be on lockdown too?" "No, it's only Hale."  God, that makes me feel loved. We just got news that we may end up on lockdown soon to though. Looking out the window here I can see all the local news stations setting up camp in the faculty parking lot. Goody.

      I had a weird lunch conversation with Lucia today. L: "You are so Stephanie's bitch, Angela." Me: "I'm not her bitch... We're just friends." L: "Angela, she treats you badly and uses you for sexual favors. You are definitely her bitch." Damn her, she's right... Oh well, to Lucia is always an interesting experience.  Lucia: "I want to be just like that one lady on "CSI:Miami" some day." Me: "Which one?" Lucia "You know, that one lady who stands around in the morgue all day fondling the dead people."  It's really embarrassing when you get caught spying on your neighbors... I'm still obsessed with that one guy that lives behind me, he's bloody hot. He and a couple of his friends were working on his motorcycle earlier and he was riding it around in circles behind my house. I was watching out of my bedroom window figuring he wouldn't bother to look up at my house. Well, he didn't but his friend did. So there I am leaning on my window sill and staring at Tim (not his actual name) and the entire time his friend was standing in the shadows watching me. Good lord, when I finally noticed him I backed up really fast making a further asshat of myself. Lovely.  Well, I feel like dancing or something. Must have been the 5 cups of coffee I just drank. I'm off to bounce off walls for a few hours.

      I was standing at the vending machines today with Lucia and Mia at lunch. I didn't know that Clara was also there,so anyway she decided to entertain the long line behind us by yelling, "Damn Angela! Can't you hurry?! You're such a little whore! Angela you fucking slut! I bet you'd fuck anyone in here!" I turned around slowly thinking I was about to be killed by someone only to see everyone in the room staring at Clara. Finally one guy I didn't even know said, "What the fuck is your problem?" Clara just grinned like a fool and said "It's OK. We're buddies! I can call her anything I like! HAH! You can't!" and she ran out of the room. The guy just gave me this totally pitying look. Good lord. She was joking though, she apologized later and did my math homework so all was fine.  Our lunch group is growing, frighteningly enough. It used to just be Alice, Lucia, Helen and I that would lurk about the music corridor at lunch. Apparently our other friends have decided to merge because lately it's been, Lucia, Alice, Helen, Cece, Steph, Kassie, Mia, Rose, Breanna and I. Helen made the mistake of saying hello to some random friendless outcast named Will a few days ago and now he WON'T GO AWAY! Seriously! Every bloody day, he wanders in and just sits there. Now, I'm always open to new comers but this is weird. He's "Special", really.  Wow, the more I think about it the more it sounds like I've become a bully! Jesus, I never thought I'd see the day. Perhaps I should be nicer to people... or something.  Mr. F officially does not care about Steph and I anymore. Yesterday he gave us permission leave class 40 minutes early and beg for food. We told him we were starving because we were homeless and shared a box on the street... Anyway, he was so disgusted with us he just told us to go away. YAY! Actually, he took it back today. He made me stay 10 minutes after class so that he could stare creepy-like at me. Oddness.

      *sigh* My pants are lonely when it's only me in them...  Got a ride with my mum to school this morning, too late to walk. Anyway, I was getting out of the car when Steph and her current BF Wes walked pass. Steph said hello and told me to wait for her. Then she made out with Wes right in front of me. Great Steph, make me feel even crappier about being single. Oh well, I think she noticed how sad I was cause she threw her arms around me and said "Cheer up, babe. I love you too you know." LOL.   Today was pretty random. We had a sub in tech so it was pretty much free time. James came over and sprawled out on my desk. "Angela?" "Yeah?" "I love you." *Pause* "Can you break a five?"  Helen brought up something today that made me remember this lovely little embarrassing moment. A few months ago we had a huge statewide math contest. I suck at math but contestants were promised super extra credit for even showing up so of course Alice, Cece, Helen, Nagisa and I went. It was actually pretty advanced, hard for even the pre-calc students so we were pretty out of place. Alice, Nagisa, Cece and I shared a table. Anyway, halfway through the test I pulled a lollipop out of my bookbag and started eating it. Cece leaned over and said "Hey, no eating in the library." but I pretty much ignored her, she's a dweebus anyway. A few seconds later she said "Why the lollipop anyway?" I was in the middle of a problem so I was pretty distracted. So without thinking I said VERY loudly "Because sucking helps me think!" Everyone in the library turned around to look at me. Cue Helen from several tables away stating "Oh, so that's why you get so much thinking done in bed!". The entire library erupted into laughter and didn't stop until the instructor started screaming. Good Lord.  I think all the cold medicine I'm one is finally starting to affect my brain. I was reading a some local newspaper this afternoon and I must have read on title over 8 times before I figured out what it said. It was something like "Tension has risen over current accusations..." except I kept reading "tension" as "tomatoes". God knows why. I couldn't figure out what the hell tomatoes would be doing rising over anything though.   Well, Good Night.

      Eww. I feel all ...Hormonal and teenagery. What else is new?  I had a bizarrely fun time at the Equity Summit on Friday. We were in this workshop thing on stereotypes in film at one point. At the beginning we were supposed to give our name, favorite animal, favorite color, our race, one stereotype about our race and then debunk said stereotype. There were over 100 people in the room so it took ages to get through all the introductions. Lucia, Breanna, Maija and I were all near the back of the room so we were last and needless to say, very bored. Lucia's intro made me laugh though: "Hi! My name is Lucia. I'm orange and my favorite color is Latina!" She did it for a laugh but the instructor seemed to think she was serious which made it even funnier.  Anyway, I was supposed to disprove the "White People can't dance." stereotype. I'm not actually the best person for that as I can't dance. So I just said "Loads of white people can dance." To which some random guy sitting near me replied "Yeah! We can river dance!" Things like that make me so very proud of my whiteness. Yeah right.  Goodbye, I'm off to make a rocket out of a soda bottle. (Really, it's some crap science thing.)

      The guy that lives behind me is really starting to bother me. Maybe I just have too much time on my hands in the summer or something but I've really started noticing him this past week. I have to say, he kinda pisses me off. He never treats me like he treats other people, and not in a good way. He's really hard to read too. Like I've said before, he's my dad's buddy which mean's he's around quite a bit. Yesterday I was laying around in my room with the window open. My room looks right out over the backyard and my dad's shop. Anyway, my dad was out there working on one of his motorcycles and Troy walked up to talk to him. I was only half listening to their conversation until they started talking about me.  Dad: "...so I was telling my daughter about that earlier." T: "So, is she asking for her own motorcycle yet?" Dad: "Not quite, her mother is pretty opposed to her riding." T: "Oh. She'll want one though." Dad: "I know." T: "How old is she? 16, 17?" Dad: "Something like that." It always weirds me out when I hear people talking about me. The part that really sacred me was that my dad doesn't appear to know how old I am. He never does remember my birthday... That conversation didn't bother me at all, but coupled with the fact that every single time I've heard him talking to one of my parents recently he's brought me up. Me. Now, it would make since if my parental units did it, but HE does. That's a stark contrast from the Troy I know. The one that rarely talks to me unless he has to. It's not like I want anything form him, just for him to be nice to me.

      Wednesday's dinner with Alice was interesting. I don't think I've been to a party like that since elementary school, no drinking or smoking and it ended at 8:00Pm, does that even meet the definition of party? Who knows... Highlight of the party was when Sasha turned to me and Lucia and yelled "Male chickens are called cocks!". I choked on my cake and couldn't stop laughing. For the rest of the night we couldn't stop making cock jokes. Ex" "Hey Alice, do you have any caulk?" "Cock?!" "You know, nice, white caulk..." "You're disgusting!"  Thursday was fun. Alice, Lucia, Vendy and I went to a water park and spent the entire day there. The ride over was fucking hilarious, Alice's mum drove us. At one point we were on the freeway and Alice's mum kept taking her hands off the wheel. Vendy turned around and screamed "Holy shit! She's driving with her knees!" Vendy just freaked out and I couldn't stop laughing. The park itself was pretty cool too. We went on a river ride thingy complete with innertubes. Alice and I were floating along and talking, Alice said something that struck me as completely fucking hilarious and I started laughing. Unfortunately I was laughing so hard that I fell off of my innertube, the "river" was only 3 ft deep so I just stood up and started laughing even harder. Then I noticed that all of this had transpired right next to a lifeguard and said lifeguard was looking at me like I was a complete fucktard. So I waved at him, he waved back and all of sudden I see Lucia float past. She starts laughing too and pretty soon we've managed to stop the entire ride. Good Lord.  Everything is funny when you're on a ride, seriously. Take these lovely quotes for example. Every last one made me laugh like me like an idiot. "Licky boom boom down!" "Auggh! I see wooden boobs!" "Go turkey." "Aww fuck, there goes my spleen..." "I'm going to my happy place... C'mon I-5, don't fail me now!" Goodnight! :)

      Well, I'm sitting here in the dark, all the windows in my house open, listening to Billie Holiday's "Summertime" and I've been thinking. I keep wondering what I'm doing exactly, has there been a point to all this? My life, I mean. I really should stop feeling sorry for myself, it doesn't really help anything. I've got dinner with Alice tomorrow night then a little birthday party Thursday afternoon. Fun, right? Should be...  About an hour ago I drank an entire pot of coffee and then went out in the dark to powerwash my house. My mum thinks I'm an idiot and I think one of my neighbors may have called the police. Did I mention this was an industrial strength powerwasher? Very, very loud. So that probably wasn't one of my best idea's. I was supposed to do that this morning but I was too busy sleeping. I'm re-painting a section of our house, the toolshed, and the shop this weekend. I hate painting buildings so my parents have decided this is entirely my job. Thanks mucho parental units...  One of my neighbors lost his dog a few days ago. He is, of course, very upset. I understand completely. That did not give him the right to accuse me though. No wait, not me, the "syphilitic gang of rabbits" I unleashed on our neighborhood is what apparently abducted and murdered his dog. I kid you not. First of all, what the fuck? Second, I have TWO rabbits, they are fixed, live in my house, and do not have syphilis. What's more, they're RABBITS, I don't think they're capable of killing a 120Lb dog or "abducting" one for that matter. This guy may be more insane then I am. I think we should be best friends...  Oh hold on here, my mum just made me another pot of coffee. Lady, you don't know what you're getting yourself into. I'm going to drink it and run around outside for a few hours. :)

      It's going to be a long boring summer and that's exactly what I want. My friends all have jobs this summer but I'm a slacker. I actually got offered a place in a community college for this summer. It was a course for high school students in business technology. There actually weren't many positions open and you had to qualify for it so I was surprised when they chose me. But I declined and my dad is still yelling at me for it. I'd rather spend my summer sleeping and partying. He says that was a really crap idea as the course involved experience and money off college. Screw that.

      Twas the very last day of school. I very nearly made it through the whole day too. The party in the park got called off at the last minute cause security was on uber-patrol this afternoon. Police were lurking about everywhere and wouldn't leave us innocent stoners alone. So I skipped 6th period and walked home instead. I was crossing a rather busy street with Alice when a huge fright truck pulled up next to us. In the cab sat the most stereotypical white trash trucker I had ever seen. He stared at me a bit, looked me up and down and gave me a creepy leering smile. All I could think was "Aww shit.." Alice started to walk in front of his truck so I followed her. When I was exactly in front of his truck he fucking spun his tires. I was just walking and all of a sudden *VROOM SCREECH* I jumped halfway across the road. He just started laughing, when I turned around he was lighting a cigarette and waving me over to his truck. I just gave the asshole the finger and walked off. Fucking idiot...  I was walking down the hallway in my house at about midnight yesterday. I glanced at the window that looks out over our driveway and noticed a flash of movement. So I walked over to the window and saw the most amusing sight ever. A man was riding a bicycle up and down our driveway, at 12Am, and he was talking to himself. So I opened the window a bit, sure enough, the man was holding a conversation with himself, in my driveway. The voice sounded REALLY familiar but I couldn't see who it was because I wasn't wearing my contacts. So I ran to get my old glasses from my room and when I came back I got the shock of my life. IT WAS T! My hot neighbor, evidently he was stoned but I could not stop laughing. Good lord!  I had to take my math final today, Ms.B set up our desks so we had a lot of private space. My desk was facing the windows looking out over the front street. I was watching the traffic and everything. The special ed teachers were leading a troop of special kids down the front street. All of a sudden one of the retarded kids attacked another, they were rolling screaming and hitting each other in the street. Tracy was sitting behind me and started screaming "OH MY GOD! Everybody! Quick, the retards are fighting!" So, of course everybody ran to the windows. Ms. B went into a fit. It was great, we didn't finish the final until extremely late though.  I forgot to return a $90 dollar text book... I feel like such an idiot, I have to run it over tomorrow or they won't release my grades. Fuck.   It is officially summer now. Finally, I get to sleep! I lurve summer!

      Alice is pissed at me. We were supposed to eat lunch together today but she's been insulting me non-stop lately and it's starting to fucking drive me insane. Anyway, I went with Mia, Kaci, Dan, and Kai instead. We went out into another part of the campus woods to smoke. Dan had a sweet bong, pretty and blue. I like blue... It was my first time using a bong though, that's a pretty strange experience. It was totally great until Dan decided to replace the water with some of my Sprite Remix, trust me, it's not a good idea. We're going to go do it again tomorrow. After I take my math finals we're off to party in the wood, Kaci and I are going to build a tire swing and then we'll eat, smoke and swing. Loverly...   Me and my daddy are cross-state on Friday night. We're bringing his entire group too. My mum was less then impressed though. This afternoon we were sitting in Starbucks talking about the trip. Mum: "Wait, you're traveling six hours on your motorcycle just so you can sleep in a room full of hairy men?" Me: "Yah, pretty much... They're really nice hairy dudes though." She just stared at me for a while but I think we're good anyway.  Tomorrow is the last day of school! So I get all summer to do nothing, in style! I'm off to practice now.

      I am still alive, two seconds after I posted that last entry I realized what an idiot I am. I was going to get completely stoned and then, less then an hour later, I was going to ride a fucking motorcycle over the freeway. I'm truly far stupider then I ever thought. Anyway, I had to put the whole getting high with Mia thing off until Monday. Motorcycles are better then drugs... Call me a loser, I don't care. I've been riding that bike all weekend and I really can't think of anything better to waste my time with.

      Those sound clips below are obviously from earlier today, Alice and I were so bored... It was interesting though, I was depressed, I think Alice was worried. She skipped class and came with me. The park is always such a strange place, the trails are filled with little kids and old people walking their dogs but even step a few feet off the path and you run into stoners smoking right out in the open. Toward the end of our visit Alice and I had moved from the top of the hill we had spent most of our time on, to the other side of the park by the creek. We were sitting under the wood bridge that leads back to the road when some random kids from our school walked down the path. They stopped and stared at us, they were obviously high and we knew them. Alice asked one of them, (incidentally an ex of Steph's) if he had been smoking. Instantly they all started talking, "Nah, but look what you guys are doing! You're skipping school!." He turned to look at me "Like, stay in school, don't take drugs and.... OH MY GOD! I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT COLOR BEFORE!" It was fucking priceless, I just gave him a thumbs up, he winked and they ran off to find other new colors or something.   Speaking of drugs, when I got back to campus I met up with Mia. Through some mutual friend she had found out about how depressed I've been lately. She seemed pretty worried and decided she was going to cheer me up. So we're going to leave during lunch tomorrow and go to her house. We're going to spend some good, quality bonding time together for a few hours, obviously with the help of some weed. Maybe some shrooms or ecstasy if she can get a hold of it by tomorrow. So I'm looking forward to it. All I want is to be happy... I don't even care what it takes anymore, I just want to feel happy again.   On the plus side, I do have something to look forward to. My dad is picking up his newest motorcycle tomorrow afternoon and I get to ride it home! I have to borrow T's helmet though, that oughta be interesting. Or we could just bring him with us. I fucking love that guy. Cheers, here's to hoping its mutual! Suppose I'll see soon enough.

      Bah, I woke up feeling awful this morning. My stomach hurt, I was tired and I was just really depressed. Everything has just sort of sucked lately, nothing has been going my way, I'm really stressed out over my grades, and life has just been shitty in general. I forced myself out the door this morning because I had a giant presentation to give in health but I was running really late so I got a ride with my mom. On the ride over I remember thinking "Something bloody good better happen today, life owes me that.". The second I set foot on the sidewalk in front of school the late bell rang, I just turned around and stared at the building. Finally I just said "Fuck this." and got right back in the car. Evidently life wasn't going to be nice to me so I was going home. My mom yelled at me for a few minutes but I just grinned at her like a madwoman and eventually we drove back home. She thinks I've gone insane, she is not wrong.  Yet, I think I got my good thing this afternoon. My dad was making me clean motorcycle parts in the backyard. I was sitting out there scrubbing part of an engine case when T walked up. Fuck, just talking to that guy makes me happy. I don't know, I made a total ass of myself again but I'm still happy now. He's just so sweet... Talking to him makes it seem like nothing else really matters. So despite what he may think of me, I owe him a lot for that.

      So I'm home on a Saturday night out of choice. Pathetic isn't it? I gave up three parties this weekend. I'm officially too lazy to live. Bah...  I was eating lunch yesterday with Mia, Rose, Lucia and Kacy when one of Alice's friends showed up. Her name is Kit, she really is nice and I'd love to be her friend but I always get the feeling that she thinks she's better then us. She invited me to a party she was having last night and then added "It's in a church, but don't worry! I won't try to convert you or anything, Angela!" This comment confused me for a few seconds, do I look like a Satan worshipper? How does she know I don't practice Christianity? I swear, I've never made a big deal out of my beliefs. I even look pretty normal right now, much more then I used to. The she leaned forward and whispered "I'd ask you to bring some of your friends... but I don't think any of them would be very welcome in a church." I nearly said "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!" but then I noticed Lucia was explaining her theory on what Gonzo from the Muppets actually did with that chicken in vivid detail. So I shut my mouth and just nodded. I was actually tempted to go, the party sounded like fun for what it was. But, other things came up so I didn't get to go. Oh well, what sort of party only runs til 10 PM anyway? Not any kind I've ever been to.   Everything else this weekend involved getting high with Mia. I love Mia, but the last one of her parties I went to involved me passing out in her basement. When I woke up I was lying on a futon with a half-naked girl I didn't even know. I think it was a confusing moment for both of us but we got over it and just went back to sleep until morning. I never did find out who she was but she was very nice. Anyway, I skipped that whole affair this weekend. You should only have to face things like that every once in a while.  I'm starting to REALLY worry about Steph. She hasn't been to school for weeks and we haven't been able to contact her. She's not even answering her cell phone and that's not like her at all. I hope she's ok, wherever she is...  I suspect that one of my bunnies, Ariel, is actually a fuzzy three-pound spawn of Satan. That little critter is evil to the core. Bloody cute, but evil. I had to go somewhere with my parental units this morning so I was trying to herd her back into the laundry room where she and my other bunny, Harvey, live. They have to stay down there when we leave because if they tramp around in the main house they'd set off the security alarm. Anyway, she was hiding under the guest bed and when I looked under it she lunged out and attacked my face. I'm not kidding, she went at it full force, I have a huge scratch running from the corner of my left eye to my mouth. God she's evil.  I have to go write an assload of essays right now. I'm such a procrastinator. Bye. :)

      Shroomies are strange people. They're really a lot of fun though. Someone laced some of Mia's food with shrooms this morning. Mia's a shroomie anyway but it freaked her out because she wasn't expecting it at all. She was sitting in 1st block when everything started to slow down and the wall started to drip colors. She got so scared she ran out of class and went to find me. Lucky for her I wasn't in class, I was out in the west corridor trying to pass the time until my next class. Anyway she ran up and hugged me and wouldn't let go. I ended up skipping my next block too, I took Mia down to the park to help her out. She was really fucked up for a while but she was having a pretty good time. God I love Mia...  I wonder if I'll ever meet a normal person? I swear, I never have met anyone in the slightest bit normal. This afternoon I met a kid who looks like he's 16 going on 35. He's got millions waiting for him in trust funds, he only ended up at our crap little school because he got kicked out of some posh private school. The thing is, he's convinced he can just cruise though school and never have to work a day in is life. I really don't think that's going to work out for him. Anyway, he's very nice, he bought me a drink and everything.   I've been feeling really depressed lately and I don't know why. It's really weird, sometimes I just feel like something needs to change. Like everything has been exactly the same for way to long. It doesn't make any sense because things have changed a lot recently.   I've got a whole assload of end-of-the-year work to do. Bunch of essays and shit. I hate homework. Unfortunately it's ALL due next week and I have to get my ass in gear. So I'm off to do... something.

      Taking large amounts of caffeine can be an interesting experience. I just took 800 mg and I can't even see straight right now. Not to mention I'm typing a faster then I thought was humanly possible. I feel all twitchy and sort of... fuzzy for lack of a better word. Like I'm not feeling properly or something. Caffeine can be amazingly fun for something so simple. Sure, most people just get twitchy and have to pee a lot, but there are those of us for which it does oh so much more. I only know Helen because Megan, Steph and I convinced her to take a whole buttload of caffeine pills at a retreat one night. She kept thinking the garbage cans were moving. Then she fell down the the stairs and we had to drag her outside. That is how really great friendships are made...  I'm starting to worry about hot neighbor-dude. I haven't spoken to him much since a week ago but I've had some really odd run-ins with him in the last few days. He's become really good friends with my dad, helping him rebuild motorcycles and the like. I know all of my dad's good friends pretty well because there always around. They smile, wave, make polite small talk etc. They're all perfectly nice to me. T is a bit different though. For one thing he's the only one of them under 40. Isn't it a bit weird for a 20 something to hang out with guys in there 40's to 60's? Bah, that's not the point. Anyway, in the past few days he's been around constantly. Yesterday I was taking some pictures of some of their bikes for them. I was standing in T's driveway to do this because everyone parked down there. My dad was standing behind me pointing out specific things he needed close-ups of for his website. My dad's friend Matt came out of T's garage, smiled and said hi like any normal person would and started talking to my dad. So I went back to photographing things. Several minutes later I turned around to see T standing a few feet behind me and just staring at me. I have no idea how long he was standing there. He didn't say anything so I smiled at him. He just looked really flustered for a few seconds, flashed me a bit of a smile and walked really quickly back into his house. What the hell was that all about?  So today when I went home he was standing in my backyard talking to my dad. I got out of my car, grabbed my bookbag and turned around to look into the yard. Yup, staring again. Lovely. So I smiled and waved in a neighborly sort of way. For a few seconds he looked around all confused and then slowly smiled and waved back. Good lord that man's weird. I mean, we know each other, we live right bloody next to each other. If he hated me he would at least still be polite? Hell, that lady down the street that thinks I run a meth lab waves at me, albeit a bit reluctantly. Somebody help me with this one, what's his issue?  I was looking at the back of Helen's notebook this morning. In VERY large letters it says: Angela is my Ho. She's tall, skinny, and easily breakable!" Could something like that be considered sexual harassment? That girls even stranger than I am...

      Sitting in my car this afternoon on a traffic-crowded street. Oppressively hot day, humid as fuck. I had managed to hit rush hour and I hadn't moved for at least 20 minutes. Suddenly I hear someone yelling, I turn my head to see the most ridiculous thing I'd seen for weeks. Some dude was marching proudly down the street, wearing a clown's nose, bunny ears and face paint and holding a box of Trix cereal above his head. He was pointing at the cereal box and smiling like an idiot. Several people were yelling after him, but he just pointed to the cereal, gave everyone a thumbs up and marched on. It was brilliant, I seriously wanted to get out and join him. That was quite possibly my soul mate. Or at least someone from my home planet.

      Tired... Which is sad because I didn't get up until noon today. But I've been tired all freaking week now. Fuck it.. I'm just lazy.  Uggh. I had to go somewhere yesterday morning. I dragged myself out into the driveway at the disgustingly early hour of 10 AM (shut up) and opened the car door. Unfortunately I got distracted by something, turned around too fast, got my purse strap stuck to the door, lost balance and fell spectacularly ass first into the car. Of course, the passing group of neighborhood children erupted into laughter making it even more embarrassing. Thanks a buttload karma...  I was bleaching my hair again this afternoon, mostly to fix the monstrosity of a color my friends have dubbed "retro 70's couch". Did you know hair dye has nonoxynol-9 in it? Yup, I routinely cover my head in spermicidal lubricant. *Grins* Ain't that special? No? Well it's been a really slow couple of weeks...  My dad was prancing around all morning talking about getting somebody "all roofie'd up and shit". I worry about him some days. He recently proclaimed himself the village pervert. He's also threatened a few of his buddies with anal rape... That man is definitely on something, god I wish he would share.  Goodnight. I might actually try to sleep tonight. :)

      It's been a weird few weeks, I would've posted but my computer has been dying piece by piece. In the last 2 weeks it has managed to completely fuck up 2 video cards, one monitor, and a hard drive. It's not like it wasn't expected, I've had the damn thing since 2000. I'm just amazed by how rapidly it disintigrated. Got a lovely new flat screen monitor out of it though, and an entirely new (and far suprior) CPU is on order. A third, really good, video card is sitting on my desk right now curtesy of a friend of my dad's. So all should be back to normal soon.  Anyway, last night my dad managed to dump his brand new Harley sportster into a ditch. Fuckin amazing... After dinner, around 9PM-ish he invited me to ride around the city with him. I should've known better, I had just watched him drink nearly an entire bottle of wine at dinner and a few beers before and after. But, idiot that I am, I just got on. He didn't actually crash or anything. We were at the top of our back road and when he stopped and started to lose his balance. The bike was totally stopped, he was just too drunk to hold it up. I put my feet down and stood up hoping I could steady the bike but at that point the bike was leaning too far so I just swung my leg over and stepped back. The bike started to fall, my dad jumped off and we both watched as it slid down into a rocky, muddy ditch. It was a truely awful sight: a beautiful new bike like that, lying on it side in a ditch, lights still on and motor still running. Of course after a minute on it side the bike shut off and after the intitial "Oh fuck, Oh FUCK!" mutterings from both of us we set about pulling it out. I wasn't that hard actually, it's a pretty heavy bike but after we pushed it back up on it's tires it was just a matter of rolling it up the side of the ditch. Once back on the road, we set about swearing and looking for damage. He got luck though, big chunk out of the winsheild and a few tiny scratchs but thats about it. Damn lucky.  I hate riding as a passenger, I figure if I crash it might as well be my fault. At least I'd only have myself to blame.  On to other matters, lot of weird shit with Troy lately. I was almost tired of messing with him last night, he never ceases to piss me off. We have NEVER had a normal conversation, one of us (usually me) fucks everything up and comes out looking like an idiot. Anyway, it's gotten to the point where I avoid my own driveway because everytime I go out there I run into him, and he's still doing that creepy staring shit (so what if I stare back?). It reached an all time low last night, I was taking the trash out and he and his friend were sitting on his front steps. Troy just stopped dead in the middle of talking and just watched me. His freind look confused and tried to get his attention but he just kept staring. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!?  I wasn't even thinking about him this morning. I was eating breakfast and my dad popped in looking excited. "Hey, Troys in the backyard and he looks like fuckin' Aunt Jemima! You have to come see!" Frightenly enough, he was right. He had a bandanna tried around his head old woman style, tied in the front with the little end bits sticking up. Obviously not the bad-ass look he was going for, more like the "I need to keep my hair out of my face while I dust the house" look. Well, it made me feel better.  Spent another day swimming with Alice and Lucia a week ago. I got the sunburn from hell though and my back is still peeling, gross.   I'm going to Canada on Wednesday. Finally, I can get away.  :)
