      So pipit put on da intro on my Blogger! Since I was introduced to them blogger by her...  I named my first blog 'DAY 1'. It's been quite a while since i really wrote things! i've usually really appreciate things dat happened by expressing it through writings!Cant remember when it really stops...all i can remember is why........But today i realize this is what has been missing!letting my self go inside of my self!No Lies..No fear..No burden!HONEST!UNDRESS!STRIPPED! No one to judge but your self! I'm gonna catch up with every scene of life dat had evolved through my eyes, my heart,my mind. Dat had shaped my intuition and made me what i've become!

To tell you the truth, i wasnt concentating a lot on the meeting, thinking about those shoes, party gears and cosmetics that were on sale. He..he..he..! She went to get her diatermia ( or whatever that is ) come back and had a gooooood bowls of bakso and siomay at her house. we PIG OUT! Yeaah...!  While burning some images for the flyer, i showed her how my blogs looked like and she liked it. And she want one...and this is about the end of the story. She got one.

      I missed swimming today...Stayed up late playing playstation with Yoga & Agie! The GOOD NEWS...i'm done with my therapy!Yesterday was like the last session after a month of it! Another GOOD NEWS...was my mom's birthday!so today me, Yoga and my mom went out eating and birthday presents hunt! She turns 50 today!I'm really happy for her today!She looks so excited about the day! But to tell the truth...underneath i felt sumkind of worried! I know i shouldn't be! But from where i'm standing you just couldn't! I think everyone's been through this kind of Tight Spot! Where u went crushed to melt everytime u imagine or think bout your parents health condition and their never ending life problems! For me it happens quite often!But particularly days like today!Where u sing happy birthday, kiss them and trying to shut tears from falling down!Ooh it was so sad! Happy 50th Birthday Mommy!
