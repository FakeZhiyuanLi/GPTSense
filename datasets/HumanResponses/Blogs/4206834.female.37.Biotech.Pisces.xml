      On the APA Endorsement Of Gay Marriage by Frank York July 29, 2004 - National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) President Joseph Nicolosi and Linda Nicolosi, co-authors of A Parent's Guide To Preventing Homosexuality, have expressed concern over the American Psychological Association's recent endorsement of gay marriage. The American Psychological Association issued its endorsement of gay marriage, foster parenting, and gay adoptions at its conference in Hawaii on July 29. The APA's endorsement was based on recommendations from the APA's Working Group on Same-Sex Families and Relationships, a group of gay and lesbian clinicians who have been prominent in gay causes. Dr. Nicolosi noted that although the APA considers itself a scientific organization, "They've let political activists take over the APA, and they are giving us their own, values-laden 'take' on the issues." Nicolosi observed that because the APA has started out "with the foundational belief that there's no real difference between the genders, then mothers and fathers start to look interchangeable. With such a worldview, gay and straight relationships look the same; then gay marriage starts to look as if it were no different from the natural, biological family." But the APA's foundational beliefs are flawed, says Nicolosi. "And, when the research comes in--as indeed it has--showing gays and lesbians to be less psychologically healthy than straights, then the APA simply dismisses it, saying that the psychological problems are due to society's homophobia." NARTH Publications Director Linda Nicolosi is equally troubled by the APA's endorsement of gay marriage and believes the APA should openly define what it means by "healthy sexuality," "healthy families," "healthy development," and "self-actualization." She notes, "Without agreement on these basic terms, what we have is one philosophical camp--the APA--disagreeing with another philosophical camp, the traditionalists. But the irony is, the APA gets to have the unfair advantage of calling itself 'scientific' while the other side is labeled 'religious.' In reality, the APA is recommending nothing more than its own secular humanist worldview--a worldview that most of America simply doesn't share." "Nobody to Give the Other Viewpoint" Robert Spitzer, M.D. -- longtime prominent member of the American Psychiatric Association, and a strong ally of gay activists -- says his own organization, the American Psychiatric Association, won't likely change its views on gay issues and reorientation therapy. "There's a gay-activist group that's very strong and very vocal and recognized officially by the American Psychiatric Association...there's nobody to give the other viewpoint...There may be a few people...but they don't talk." (Quoted in the 2004 video, "I Do Exist")

       Journal of the American Medical> Association; August 12, 1998)   So cite some of those "numerous studies"....The three national meetings leading up to the 1973 decision were repeatedlydisrupted by "gay" activists. At the 1970 meeting in San Francisco gay activistsdisrupted certain sessions with shouts and jeers for the purpose of prohibitingany rational discussion or debate. At the APA's 1971 meeting, homosexualactivists resorted to using threats and intimidation."There was a shift in the role of demonstrations from a form of expression to atactic of disruption. In this regard gay activists mirrored the passage of aconfrontation politics that had become the cutting edge of radical and antiwarstudent groups. The purpose of the protest was no longer to make public a pointof view, but rather to halt unacceptable activities. With ideology seen as aninstrument of domination, the traditional willingness to tolerate the views ofone's opponents was discarded."  (Ronald Bayer, Homosexuality and AmericanPsychiatry: The Politics ofDiagnosis (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 105-6.)Only one quarter of the members of the APA voted on the change, and of those 58percent favored the removal of homosexuality from their list of disorders. Inother words, only13% of the psychiatrists and psychologists in the APA caused aradical change in the classification of what was previously considered a mentalillness.Dr. Charles Socarides, one who attended the meetings and former leader of theAPA's task force studying homosexuality, writes that "militant homosexualgroupscontinued to attack any psychiatrist or psychoanalyst who dared to present hisfindings as to the psychopathology [i.e., the study of mentaldisorders from allaspects] of homosexuality before national or localmeetings of psychiatrists orin public forums."( Charles W. Socarides, Beyond Sexual Freedom (New York:QuadrangleBooks,1977), 87.) The decision of the APA was "the medical hoax of the century."(Charles W. Socarides in Robert Kronemeyer, Overcoming Homosexuality(NewYork: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1980), 5.)Richard Isay, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell MedicalCollegeand chair of APA's Committee on Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues, "[There is a]continuing conviction among most, although not all, dynamically orientedpsychiatrists in general and psychotherapists in particular, that homosexuality can and should be changed to heterosexuality..." (Richard Isay ``Homosexualityand Psychiatry," Psychiatric News (Feb. 7,1992): 3, as cited in Knight, ``Video‘On Being Gay' Twists the Facts," p. 7.)T en thousand members of the APA were asked their professional opinion on theissue: "Of those answering, 69% said they believed 'homosexuality is usually apathological adaptation, as opposed to a normal variation,' 18% disagreed and13% were uncertain.

       A suburban Washington, D.C., newspaper editor has called "hate speech" the press releases of a Christian group that ministers to families dealing with homosexuality.   In an e-mail response to Virginia-based Parents & Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX) upon receipt of the group's June 21 press release (see below), Prince George's (Maryland) Sentinel Managing Editor Vincent J. Swanson wrote, "I don't accept hate mail." "This shows exactly why so-called 'hate crime laws' are dangerous," said Janice Crouse, director of the Beverly LaHaye Institute.  "PFOX's message is unconditional love and telling the truth in love." It was not the first time Mr. Swanson had told PFOX that he was not interested in the group's point of view. On May 27, he wrote back following submission of a PFOX press release: I'm the managing editor, and I don't want your group e-mailing us. Your group is all bunk and full of hate and intolerance. Go back to school. In response, PFOX wrote to the publisher and asked to come to the paper to hold a "tolerance training session" on ex-gays for the staff. There was no response.  The full text of Mr. Swanson's June 21 letter follows the full text of the PFOX press release below: 6/21/04 7:12 p.m. Parents & Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays NEWS RELEASE, Contact: Regina Griggs, PFOX executive director703-360-2225 urlLink www.pfox.org    urlLink ex-gays@earthlink.net  Republican Senator Votes for Gay Federal Hate Crimes Law, but Refuses to Protect Ex-Gays Sen. George Allen (R-Virginia) voted for the Kennedy hate crimes amendment last Tuesday, which includes sexual orientation, but he failed to support a resolution calling for tolerance for ex-gays. Hate crimes legislation is a top priority for gay activists in their desire to gain federal designation as a minority group. But, that law might also be interpreted as a means to override states that do not have, or oppose, hate crimes laws based on sexual preference. Members of the ex-gay community and their supporters from across the country came to Capitol Hill last month for Ex-Gay Lobby Days sponsored by Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays (PFOX). PFOX, headquartered in Virginia, supports families affected by homosexuality and advocates for the ex-gay community. Ex-gays related personal stories of the hate and discrimination they experienced because they left homosexuality. They urged Congress to support a resolution calling for tolerance for ex-gays. "The resolution says that Congress condemns hate against ex-gays and affirms its commitment to a society that respects all people, including former homosexuals," said Regina Griggs, PFOX executive director. "Now who could be opposed to that? Apparently, Sen. Allen is. In a meeting with Rev. Darryl Foster, an African-American ex-gay, Allen's office did not want to sign on to the resolution. "Allen's office said that acknowledging ex-gays through the resolution would amount to 'favoritism' and the senator would not do that," said Foster. "It now seems that Sen. Allen is playing favorites and discriminating against ex-gays," said Griggs. "Sen. Allen voted for the Kennedy gay hate-crimes law, which will cost taxpayers $5 million a year to implement, yet refuses to co-sponsor our resolution, which is merely a statement condemning hate against former homosexuals and costs nothing to implement. It doesn't make sense." For the past two years, Sen. Kennedy's office has refused to make an appointment to meet with his ex-gay constituents on Ex-Gay Lobby Days. "Because of his closed-door policy to ex-gays, Kennedy's gay hate-crimes law will not protect former homosexuals," said Griggs. "Sen. Kennedy's intolerance and ignorance of ex-gay issues, and Sen. Allen's refusal to consider supporting a resolution for ex-gays, is unfortunate in this age of civil rights," continued Griggs. "These senators should promote tolerance for ex-gays." PFOX calls upon Sens. Kennedy and Allen to stop playing favorites by protecting homosexuals while ignoring ex-gays. "This divides families, is discriminatory and hurts our communities," said Griggs. "Sen. Allen should now sponsor the PFOX ex-gay resolution. He has sponsored or supported other resolutions in the past. Why not this one?"  Here is the text of Mr. Swanson's letter: To Whom It May Concern: I've asked your group several times to stop sending me your news releases. I've also unsubscribed, but I keep getting them. Once again, stop sending me news releases. I also appreciate you calling our publisher and saying that in your opinion, I should not be the editor of this newspaper, for the simple fact that I don't accept hate mail. The publisher supports my position on this issue, so we as a publishing group are demanding that you remove our name from your mailing list. Thank you. -- Vincent J. SwansonManaging EditorPrince George's Sentinel  "Isn't it interesting what passes for 'hate' these days?" said PFOX's Griggs. "We hope that Mr. Swanson will someday find it in his heart to treat ex-gays and their loved ones with the same respect he does homosexual activists

      AFT Condemns Gay Education Group for Distributing Booklet Advertising Bathhouse, Chicago Sex Establishments CHICAGO — Peter LaBarbera, President of Americans for Truth,    Condemned a homosexual education group meeting here for distributing a local “gay” visitor’s guide that contains ads for a homosexual bathhouse, a gay sex club, and other sexually-charged businesses, including two bars preferred by sadomasochists. The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) is distributing the “Gay and Lesbian Visitor’s Companion” at its annual conference, held in Arlington Heights October 6-8.   The guide, produced by the Chicago Area Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,” contains a full-page ad for Steamworks, a homosexual bathhouse in Chicago.  The ad, showing five semi-nude men in front of lockers, describes Steamworks as a “24 hour men’s gym/sauna.” Another ad in the publication, which was made available to all attendees of the GLSEN conference –– including many high school students –– advertises two sadistic-oriented gay bars and a sex club called Man’s Country.  The ad for the latter reads:  “Private Adult Complex Lockers & Rooms [used for sex], Singles, Doubles, Fantasy Suites, HUGE Whirlpool Spa, Largest Steam Room, STRIPPERBOYZ, NUDE Stage Shows every Fri/Sat Night regularly featuring your favorite Adult Video [porn] Stars.”  “For years GLSEN has claimed to protect ‘at risk’ kids.  But they are now helping put young teenage boys at risk by allowing the distribution of a gay guide that hawks anonymous sex clubs and ‘leather’ bars in Chicago,” LaBarbera said.  “Anonymous sex is immoral and dangerous.  This fits into a pattern of GLSEN failing to shield its young followers from a homosexual male sexual culture that not only tolerates, but often celebrates promiscuity.  Why didn’t GLSEN take the simple step of keeping these gay sex club ads from reaching the teenagers in their care? “At the same time, GLSEN is calling on schools to expel the Boy Scouts of America, which bans homosexual Scout leaders, from schools.  I think most parents would agree that it is GLSEN, not the Boy Scouts, that poses the real danger to impressionable kids,” he said.  LaBarbera also called on GLSEN to give details about whether and how it screens its adult leaders in the wake of the arrest of Dave Thomas, 33, a Chicago GLSEN leader, for attempting to set up a sexual liaison with an underage boy.  Thomas was a school social worker in Evanston.  On Friday, Americans for Truth led a coalition of pro-family leaders from Illinois and other states to denounce GLSEN’s extreme school agenda, which includes homosexual tolerance lessons for elementary school classrooms and workshops about bisexuality and transsexuality.

      AFT to Distribute Tapes of GLSEN ‘Fistgate’ Scandal to Senators as Opposition Mounts to Cellucci Nomination WASHINGTON, D.C.        Americans for Truth Project Director Peter LaBarbera announced today that his group will be distributing a copy of the Boston “Fistgate” audiotape to every U.S. Senator as part of an effort to educate members on why Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci should not be approved as U.S. Ambassador to Canada. The “Fistgate” tape –– produced by Parents Rights Coalition of Massachusetts –– is based on an undercover recording of a March 2000 conference workshop about “Queer Sex” sponsored by the Boston affiliate of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).  Three Massachusetts government employees led the GLSEN workshop –– advertised as “for youth only, 14-21” –– and gave “how to” discussions about homosexual sex acts, including the dangerous practice known in “gay” slang as “fisting.” (A free copy of the Fistgate tape is available from Americans for Truth: click  urlLink HERE .) Gov. Cellucci’s nomination by President Bush for the ambassadorship has angered parents and children’s advocates in Massachusetts who oppose Cellucci’s ardent support of taxpayer-funded, pro-homosexual programs in the state’s schools.  For more information on Cellucci’s pro-homosexuality record in Massachusetts, click  urlLink HERE . The anti-Cellucci campaign was joined by other groups across the nation as word spread that the Governor refused to even meet with parents concerned over the “Fistgate” scandal.  Last July, Cellucci also snubbed Ambassador Alan Keyes, who came to Boston to address a rally of parents opposed to the growing promotion of homosexuality to students.  (He rudely declined to greet Keyes, who was then welcomed by the Democrat-controlled legislature.) More than 20 local and national groups have signed on to a petition opposing the Cellucci nomination, with more signing on each day.  For more information, see  urlLink www.massnews.com . “By opposing Paul Cellucci, we are sending a message to politicians that whether you are Republican or Democrat, it is wrong to promote homosexuality in schools and they will be held accountable,” LaBarbera said.  “Gov. Cellucci has embraced the Log Cabin Republicans, a homosexual group, and the result is that he refuses to publicly denounce an event where 14-year-olds were exposed to graphic talks about homosexual perversions. “It seems that the closer politicians gravitate to homosexual lobby groups like the Log Cabin Republicans, the farther they drift from the moral concerns of parents,” LaBarbera said.  “President Bush must realize that after eight years of government promotion of homosexuality under Clinton, Americans are yearning for a return to normalcy and decency.  We will resist any promotion of the idea that it is acceptable, normal or healthy for men to have sex with men, or women with women.” He urged President Bush to reconsider his administration’s budding alliance with the Log Cabin Republicans.  On Thursday, Attorney General John Ashcroft chose to meet with leaders from the homosexual activist group as “his first meeting with a group concerned about civil rights enforcement,” AP reported. “Log Cabin is in the business of promoting the acceptance of homosexuality within the GOP.  Its leaders brand biblical Christians as haters and bigots.  This group’s agenda is by definition not a conservative, family-friendly agenda,” LaBarbera said. This week, LaBarbera was a guest on FOX talk show “Hannity & Colmes” and Christian talk show host Marlin Maddoux’s popular nationwide radio program.  He urged listeners to call Sen. Jesse Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to resist the Cellucci nomination (Capitol Switchboard: 202-224-3121).  Calls from citizens who are concerned about Cellucci representing the United States of America in Canada are pouring in to Helms and other Senators. LaBarbera said that the Cellucci nomination is rallying parents across the nation and helping alert the public to GLSEN’s radical agenda.  The homosexual organization supports pro-homosexual classroom lessons for elementary-age students including kindergartners.  GLSEN has admitted that the “Fistgate” seminar went too far, but its newsletter account of the incident focused on the alleged “privacy” violations of the students who had attended the “Queer Sex” workshop. GLSEN: Open Up to Public Noting that GLSEN is now a de facto consulting group in public (and private) schools across the nation (it receives government grants in Massachusetts), LaBarbera said the group’s agenda –– as revealed by its conferences and seminars –– should be fully open to the public. “I challenge GLSEN to stop hiding behind ‘privacy’ and make tapes of all its events available for purchase by everyday citizens,” LaBarbera said.  “Parents shouldn’t have to sneak into GLSEN events to find out what this influential group has in store for their children.” GLSEN’s two recent national conferences were not taped, while most sessions in earlier gatherings were recorded, LaBarbera noted. “If GLSEN has nothing to hide, and its goals are not harmful to young people –– which I strongly doubt –– then its leaders should have no problem allowing parents and educators full access to review their methods and goals,” he said.

       urlLink Not A Hate Crime By Joseph Farah / WorldNetDaily.com         His parents thought he was working as a hair stylist on weekends. But when Prairie Grove, Ark., police responded to a 911 emergency call at 5 a.m. Sept. 26, they found 13-year-old Jesse Dirkhising on the floor, unconscious, near death, one of his wrists bound with duct tape. A half-hour later, he was pronounced dead at St. Mary's Hospital in Roger. A police investigation determined young Jesse was repeatedly raped over a period of hours, including with foreign objects. While enduring this ordeal, his ankles, knees and wrists were bound in duct tape and he was gagged and blindfolded. He was tied to a mattress. He may have been drugged, police say. A sedative called amitryptiline was found in the home of two men -- Joshua Brown, 22, and David Don Carpenter, 38 -- along with Jesse's body. Just another brutal local crime, you say? Why is Farah recounting a police blotter story from Arkansas? I don't know. Something bothers me about this story. It ought to bother us. It was big news in Northwest Arkansas, but the story of Jesse Dirkhising hasn't made a ripple in the national news. I wonder why? I wonder if it's because the victim is not a part of some politically protected sub-group, a special class deserving of extra government privileges? I wonder if it is because the suspects are, indeed, members of such a group. Remember how the nation stood riveted to the details of a hideous murder that took place in Wyoming when a homosexual was tortured to death? Never mind that the crime had little or nothing to do with the victim's sexual proclivities. Uh-uh. That didn't matter

      The Animal Homosexuality Myth   by Luiz Sérgio Solimeo  The following article is adapted from the author's recently published book, Defending a Higher Law: Why We Must Resist Same Sex "Marriage" and the Homosexual Movement. In its effort to present homosexuality as normal, the homosexual movement[1] turned to science in an attempt to prove three major premises: Homosexuality is genetic or innate; Homosexuality is irreversible; Since animals engage in same-sex sexual behavior, homosexuality is natural.Keenly aware of its inability to prove the first two premises,[2] the homosexual movement pins its hopes on the third, animal homosexuality.[3] Animals Do It, So It's Natural, Right? The reasoning behind the animal homosexuality theory can be summed up as follows: - Homosexual behavior is observable in animals.- Animal behavior is determined by their instincts.- Nature requires animals to follow their instincts.- Therefore, homosexuality is in accordance with animal nature.- Since man is also animal, homosexuality must also be in accordance with human nature.This line of reasoning is unsustainable. If seemingly "homosexual" acts among animals are in accordance with animal nature, then parental killing of offspring and intra-species devouring are also in accordance with animal nature. Bringing man into the equation complicates things further. Are we to conclude that filicide and cannibalism are according to human nature? In opposition to this line of reasoning, this article sustains that: There is no "homosexual instinct" in animals, It is poor science to "read" human motivations and sentiments into animal behavior, and Irrational animal behavior is not a yardstick to determine what is morally acceptable behavior for rational man. There Is No "Homosexual Instinct" In Animals Anyone engaged in the most elementary animal observation is forced to conclude that animal "homosexuality," "filicide" and "cannibalism" are exceptions to normal animal behavior. Consequently, they cannot be called animal instincts. These observable exceptions to normal animal behavior result from factors beyond their instincts. -- Clashing Stimuli and Confused Animal Instincts To explain this abnormal behavior, the first observation must be the fact that animal instincts are not bound by the absolute determinism of the physical laws governing the mineral world. In varying degrees, all living beings can adapt to circumstances. They respond to internal or external stimuli. Second, animal cognition is purely sensorial, limited to sound, odor, touch, taste and image. Thus, animals lack the precision and clarity of human intellectual perception. Therefore, animals frequently confuse one sensation with another or one object with another. Third, an animal's instincts direct it towards its end and are in accordance with its nature. However, the spontaneous thrust of the instinctive impulse can suffer modifications as it runs its course. Other sensorial images, perceptions or memories can act as new stimuli affecting the animal's behavior. Moreover, the conflict between two or more instincts can sometimes modify the original impulse. In man, when two instinctive reactions clash, the intellect determines the best course to follow, and the will then holds one instinct in check while encouraging the other. With animals that lack intellect and will, when two instinctive impulses clash, the one most favored by circumstances prevails.[4] At times, these internal or external stimuli affecting an animal's instinctive impulses result in cases of animal "filicide," "cannibalism" and "homosexuality." -- Animal "Filicide" and "Cannibalism" Sarah Hartwell explains that tomcats kill their kittens after receiving "mixed signals" from their instincts: Most female cats can switch between "play mode" and "hunt mode" in order not to harm their offspring. In tomcats this switching off of "hunt mode" may be incomplete and, when they become highly aroused through play, the "hunting" instinct comes into force and they may kill the kittens. The hunting instinct is so strong, and so hard to switch off when prey is present, that dismemberment and even eating of the kitten may ensue.... Compare the size, sound and activity of kittens with the size, sound and activity of prey. They are both small, have high-pitched voices and move with fast, erratic movements. All of these trigger hunting behavior. In the tomcat, maternal behavior cannot always override hunting behavior and he treats the kittens in exactly the same way he would treat small prey. His instincts are confused.[5]Regarding animal cannibalism, the Iran Nature and Wildlife Magazine notes: Cannibalism is most common among lower vertebrates and invertebrates, often due to a predatory animal mistaking one of its own kind for prey. But it also occurs among birds and mammals, especially when food is scarce.[6] -- Animals Lack the Means to Express Their Affective States To stimuli and clashing instincts, however, we must add another factor: In expressing its affective states, an animal is radically inferior to man. Since animals lack reason, their means of expressing their affective states (fear, pleasure, pain, desire, etc.) are limited. Animals lack the rich resources at man's disposal to express his sentiments. Man can adapt his way of talking, writing, gazing, gesturing in untold ways. Animals cannot. Consequently, animals often express their affective states ambiguously. They "borrow," so to speak, the manifestations of the instinct of reproduction to manifest the instincts of dominance, aggressiveness, fear, gregariousness and so on. -- Explaining Seemingly "Homosexual" Animal Behavior Bonobos are a typical example of this "borrowing." These primates from the chimpanzee family engage in seemingly sexual behavior to express acceptance and other affective states. Thus, Frans B. M. de Waal, who spent hundreds of hours observing and filming bonobos, says: There are two reasons to believe sexual activity is the bonobo's answer to avoiding conflict. First, anything, not just food, that arouses the interest of more than one bonobo at a time tends to result in sexual contact. If two bonobos approach a cardboard box thrown into their enclosure, they will briefly mount each other before playing with the box. Such situations lead to squabbles in most other species. But bonobos are quite tolerant, perhaps because they use sex to divert attention and to diffuse tension. Second, bonobo sex often occurs in aggressive contexts totally unrelated to food. A jealous male might chase another away from a female, after which the two males reunite and engage in scrotal rubbing. Or after a female hits a juvenile, the latter's mother may lunge at the aggressor, an action that is immediately followed by genital rubbing between the two adults.[7] Like bonobos, other animals will mount another of the same sex and engage in seemingly "homosexual" behavior, although their motivation may differ. Dogs, for example, usually do so to express dominance. Cesar Ades, ethologist and professor of psychology at the University of Sгo Paulo, Brazil, explains, "When two males mate, what is present is a demonstration of power, not sex."[8] Jacque Lynn Schultz, ASPCA Animal Sciences Director of Special Projects, explains further: Usually, an un-neutered male dog will mount another male dog as a display of social dominance--in other words, as a way of letting the other dog know who's boss. While not as frequent, a female dog may mount for the same reason.[9] Dogs will also mount one another because of the vehemence of their purely chemical reaction to the smell of an estrus female: Not surprisingly, the smell of a female dog in heat can instigate a frenzy of mounting behaviors. Even other females who are not in heat will mount those who are. Males will mount males who have just been with estrus females if they still bear their scent.... And males who catch wind of the estrus odor may mount the first thing (or unlucky person) they come into contact with.[10] Other animals engage in seemingly "homosexual" behavior because they fail to identify the other sex properly. The lower the species in the animal kingdom, the more tenuous and difficult to detect are the differences between sexes, leading to more frequent confusion. -- "Homosexual" Animals Do Not Exist In 1996, homosexual scientist Simon LeVay admitted that the evidence pointed to isolated acts, not to homosexuality: Although homosexual behavior is very common in the animal world, it seems to be very uncommon that individual animals have a long-lasting predisposition to engage in such behavior to the exclusion of heterosexual activities. Thus, a homosexual orientation, if one can speak of such thing in animals, seems to be a rarity.[11] Despite the "homosexual" appearances of some animal behavior, this behavior does not stem from a "homosexual" instinct that is part of animal nature. Dr. Antonio Pardo, Professor of Bioethics at the University of Navarre, Spain, explains: Properly speaking, homosexuality does not exist among animals.... For reasons of survival, the reproductive instinct among animals is always directed towards an individual of the opposite sex. Therefore, an animal can never be homosexual as such. Nevertheless, the interaction of other instincts (particularly dominance) can result in behavior that appears to be homosexual. Such behavior cannot be equated with an animal homosexuality. All it means is that animal sexual behavior encompasses aspects beyond that of reproduction.[12] It Is Unscientific To "Read" Human MotivationAnd Sentiment Into Animal Behavior Like many animal rights activists, homosexual activists often "read" human motivation and sentiment into animal behavior. While this anthropopathic approach enjoys full citizenship in the realms of art, literature, and mythology it makes for poor science. Dr. Charles Socarides of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) observes: The term homosexuality should be limited to the human species, for in animals the investigator can ascertain only motor behavior. As soon as he interprets the animal's motivation he is applying human psychodynamics--a risky, if not foolhardy scientific approach.[13] Ethologist Cesar Ades explains the difference between human and animal sexual relations: Human beings have sex one way, while animals have it another. Human sex is a question of preference where one chooses the most attractive person to have pleasure. This is not true with animals. For them, it is a question of mating and reproduction. There is no physical or psychological pleasure....The smell is decisive: when a female is in heat, she emits a scent, known as pheromone. This scent attracts the attention of the male, and makes him want to mate. This is sexual intercourse between animals. It is the law of nature.[14] Even biologist Bruce Bagemihl, whose book Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity was cited by the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association in their amici curiae brief in Lawrence v. Texas and is touted as proof that homosexuality is natural among animals, is careful to include a caveat: Any account of homosexuality and transgender animals is also necessarily an account of human interpretations of these phenomena....We are in the dark about the internal experience of the animal participants: as a result, the biases and limitations of the human observer--in both the gathering and interpretation of data--come to the forefront in this situation.....With people we can often speak directly to individuals (or read written accounts)....With animals in contrast, we can often directly observe their sexual (and allied) behaviors, but can only infer or interpret their meanings and motivations."[15]Dr. Bagemihl's interpretation, however, throughout his 750-page book unabashedly favors the animal homosexuality theory. Its pages are filled with descriptions of animal acts that would have a homosexual connotation in human beings. Dr. Bagemihl does not prove, however, that these acts have the same meaning for animals. He simply gives them a homosexual interpretation. Not surprisingly, his book was published by Stonewall Inn Editions, "an imprint of St. Martin's Press devoted to gay and lesbian interest books." Irrational Animal Behavior Is No Blueprint For Rational Man Some researchers studying animal "homosexual" behavior extrapolate from the realm of science into that of philosophy and morality. These scholars reason from the premise that if animals do it, it is according to their nature and thus is good for them. If it is natural and good for animals, they continue, it is also natural and morally good for man. However, the definition of man's nature belongs not to the realm of zoology or biology, but philosophy, and the determination of what is morally good for man pertains to ethics. Dr. Marlene Zuk, professor of biology at the University of California at Riverside, for example, states: Sexuality is a lot broader term than people want to think. You have this idea that the animal kingdom is strict, old-fashioned Roman Catholic, that they have sex to procreate. ... Sexual expression means more than making babies. Why are we surprised? People are animals.[16]Simon LeVay entertains the hope that the understanding of animal "homosexuality" will help change societal mores and religious beliefs about homosexuality. He states: It seems possible that the study of sexual behavior in animals, especially in non-human primates, will contribute to the liberalization of religious attitudes toward homosexual activity and other forms of nonprocreative sex. Specifically, these studies challenge one particular sense of the dogma that homosexual behavior is "against nature": the notion that it is unique to those creatures who, by tasting the fruit of the tree of knowledge, have alone become morally culpable.[17]Other researchers feel compelled to point out the impropriety of transposing animal behavior to man. Although very favorable to the homosexual interpretation of animal behavior, Paul L. Vasey, of the University of Lethbridge in Canada, nevertheless cautions: For some people, what animals do is a yardstick of what is and isn't natural. They make a leap from saying if it's natural, it's morally and ethically desirable. Infanticide is widespread in the animal kingdom. To jump from that to say it is desirable makes no sense. We shouldn't be using animals to craft moral and social policies for the kinds of human societies we want to live in. Animals don't take care of the elderly. I don't particularly think that should be a platform for closing down nursing homes.[18]The animal kingdom is no place for man to seek a blueprint for human morality. That blueprint, as bioethicist Bruto Maria Bruti notes, must be sought in man himself: It is a frequent error for people to contrast human and animal behaviors, as if the two were homogenous. .... The laws ruling human behavior are of a different nature and they should be sought where God inscribed them, namely, in human nature.[19]The fact that man has a body and sensitive life in common with animals does not mean he is strictly an animal. Nor does it mean that he is a half-animal. Man's rationality pervades the wholeness of his nature so that his sensations, instincts and impulses are not purely animal but have that seal of rationality which characterizes them as human. Thus, man is characterized not by what he has in common with animals, but by what differentiates him from them. This differentiation is fundamental, not accidental. Man is a rational animal. Man's rationality is what makes human nature unique and fundamentally distinct from animal nature.[20] To consider man strictly as an animal is to deny his rationality and, therefore, his free will. Likewise, to consider animals as if they were human is to attribute to them a non-existent rationality. From Science To Mythology Dr. Bagemihl's Biological Exuberance research displays his fundamental dissatisfaction with science and enthusiasm for aboriginal mythology: Western science has a lot to learn from aboriginal cultures about systems of gender and sexuality...[21] To Western science, homosexuality (both animal and human) is an anomaly, an unexpected behavior that above all requires some sort of "explanation" or "cause" or "rationale." In contrast, to many indigenous cultures around the world, homosexuality and transgender are a routine and expected occurrence in both the human and animal worlds...[22] Most Native American tribes formally recognize--and honor--human homosexuality and transgender in the role of the 'two-spirit' person (sometimes formerly known as berdache). The 'two-spirit' is a sacred man or woman who mixes gender categories by wearing clothes of opposite or both sexes .... And often engaging in same -sex relations. ... In many Native American cultures, certain animals are also symbolically associated with two-spiritedness, often in the form of creation myths and origin legends relating to the first or "supernatural" two-spirit(s)....A Zuni creation story relates how the first two spirits--creatures that were neither male nor female, yet both at the same time--were the twelve offspring of a mythical brother-sister pair. Some of these creatures were human, but one was a bat and another an old buck Deer.[23]Dr. Bagemihl applies this androgynous myth, so widespread in today's homosexual movement, to the animal kingdom with the help of Indian and aboriginal mythology. He invites the West to embrace "a new paradigm:"[24] Ultimately, the synthesis of scientific views represented by Biological Exuberance brings us full circle--back to the way of looking at the world that is in accordance with some of the most ancient indigenous conceptions of animal (and human) sexual and gender variability. This perspective dissolves binary oppositions....Biological Exuberance is...a worldview that is at once primordial and futuristic, in which gender is kaleidoscopic, sexualities are multiple, and the categories of male and female are fluid and transmutable.[25] Conclusion In summary, the homosexual movement's attempt to establish that homosexuality is in accordance with human nature, by proving its animal homosexuality theory, is based more on mythological beliefs and erroneous philosophical tenets than on science.

      Ten Arguments From Social Science Against Same-Sex 'Marriage'   Summary:A large and growing body of social scientific evidence indicates that the intact, married family is best for children. This InFocus paper highlights ten research-based reasons why marriage should only be seen as the union of one man and one woman. Issue No.: 266 A large and growing body of scientific evidence indicates that the intact, married family is best for children. In particular, the work of scholars David Popenoe, Linda Waite, Maggie Gallagher, Sara McLanahan, David Blankenhorn, Paul Amato, and Alan Booth has contributed to this conclusion. This statement from Sara McLanahan, a sociologist at Princeton University, is representative: If we were asked to design a system for making sure that children's basic needs were met, we would probably come up with something quite similar to the two-parent ideal. Such a design, in theory, would not only ensure that children had access to the time and money of two adults, it also would provide a system of checks and balances that promoted quality parenting. The fact that both parents have a biological connection to the child would increase the likelihood that the parents would identify with the child and be willing to sacrifice for that child, and it would reduce the likelihood that either parent would abuse the child. Sara McLanahan and Gary Sandefur, Growing Up with a Single Parent: What Hurts, What Helps (Boston: Harvard University Press, 1994) 38. The following are ten science-based arguments against same-sex "marriage": 1. Children hunger for their biological parents. Homosexual couples using in vitro fertilization (IVF) or surrogate mothers deliberately create a class of children who will live apart from their mother or father. Yale Child Study Center psychiatrist Kyle Pruett reports that children of IVF often ask their single or lesbian mothers about their fathers, asking their mothers questions like the following:"Mommy, what did you do with my daddy?" "Can I write him a letter?" "Has he ever seen me?" "Didn't you like him? Didn't he like me?" Elizabeth Marquardt reports that children of divorce often report similar feelings about their non-custodial parent, usually the father. Kyle Pruett, Fatherneed (Broadway Books, 2001) 204. Elizabeth Marquardt, The Moral and Spiritual Lives of Children of Divorce. Forthcoming. 2. Children need fathers. If same-sex civil marriage becomes common, most same-sex couples with children would be lesbian couples. This would mean that we would have yet more children being raised apart from fathers. Among other things, we know that fathers excel in reducing antisocial behavior and delinquency in boys and sexual activity in girls. What is fascinating is that fathers exercise a unique social and biological influence on their children. For instance, a recent study of father absence on girls found that girls who grew up apart from their biological father were much more likely to experience early puberty and a teen pregnancy than girls who spent their entire childhood in an intact family. This study, along with David Popenoe's work, suggests that a father's pheromones influence the biological development of his daughter, that a strong marriage provides a model for girls of what to look for in a man, and gives them the confidence to resist the sexual entreaties of their boyfriends. * Ellis, Bruce J., et al., "Does Father Absence Place Daughters at Special Risk for Early Sexual Activity and Teenage Pregnancy?" Child Development, 74:801-821. * David Popenoe, Life Without Father (Boston: Harvard University Press, 1999). 3. Children need mothers. Although homosexual men are less likely to have children than lesbians, homosexual men are and will be raising children. There will be even more if homosexual civil marriage is legalized. These households deny children a mother. Among other things, mothers excel in providing children with emotional security and in reading the physical and emotional cues of infants. Obviously, they also give their daughters unique counsel as they confront the physical, emotional, and social challenges associated with puberty and adolescence. Stanford psychologist Eleanor MacCoby summarizes much of this literature in her book, The Two Sexes. See also Steven Rhoads' book, Taking Sex Differences Seriously. Eleanor MacCoby, The Two Sexes: Growing Up Apart, Coming Together (Boston: Harvard, 1998). Steven Rhoads, Taking Sex Differences Seriously (Encounter Books, 2004). 4. Evidence on parenting by same-sex couples is inadequate. A number of leading professional associations have asserted that there are "no differences" between children raised by homosexuals and those raised by heterosexuals. But the research in this area is quite preliminary; most of the studies are done by advocates and most suffer from serious methodological problems. Sociologist Steven Nock of the University of Virginia, who is agnostic on the issue of same-sex civil marriage, offered this review of the literature on gay parenting as an expert witness for a Canadian court considering legalization of same-sex civil marriage: Through this analysis I draw my conclusions that 1) all of the articles I reviewed contained at least one fatal flaw of design or execution; and 2) not a single one of those studies was conducted according to general accepted standards of scientific research. This is not exactly the kind of social scientific evidence you would want to launch a major family experiment. Steven Nock, affidavit to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice regarding Hedy Halpern et al. University of Virginia Sociology Department (2001). 5. Evidence suggests children raised by homosexuals are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders. Although the evidence on child outcomes is sketchy, it does suggest that children raised by lesbians or homosexual men are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders. Judith Stacey-- a sociologist and an advocate for same-sex civil marriage--reviewed the literature on child outcomes and found the following: "lesbian parenting may free daughters and sons from a broad but uneven range of traditional gender prescriptions." Her conclusion here is based on studies that show that sons of lesbians are less masculine and that daughters of lesbians are more masculine. She also found that a "significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbian mothers than those raised by heterosexual mothers ... reported having a homoerotic relationship." Stacey also observes that children of lesbians are more likely to report homoerotic attractions. Her review must be viewed judiciously, given the methodological flaws detailed by Professor Nock in the literature as a whole. Nevertheless, theses studies give some credence to conservative concerns about the effects of homosexual parenting. Judith Stacey and Timothy Biblarz, "(How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter?" American Sociological Review 66: 159-183. See especially 168-171. 6. Same-sex "marriage" would undercut the norm of sexual fidelity within marriage. One of the biggest threats that same-sex "marriage" poses to marriage is that it would probably undercut the norm of sexual fidelity in marriage. In the first edition of his book in defense of same-sex marriage, Virtually Normal, homosexual commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote: "There is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman." Of course, this line of thinking--were it incorporated into marriage and telegraphed to the public in sitcoms, magazines, and other mass media--would do enormous harm to the norm of sexual fidelity in marriage. One recent study of civil unions and marriages in Vermont suggests this is a very real concern. More than 79 percent of heterosexual married men and women, along with lesbians in civil unions, reported that they strongly valued sexual fidelity. Only about 50 percent of gay men in civil unions valued sexual fidelity. Esther Rothblum and Sondra Solomon, Civil Unions in the State of Vermont: A Report on the First Year. University of Vermont Department of Psychology, 2003. David McWhirter and Andrew Mattison, The Male Couple (Prentice Hall, 1984) 252. 7. Same-sex "marriage" would further isolate marriage from its procreative purpose. Traditionally, marriage and procreation have been tightly connected to one another. Indeed, from a sociological perspective, the primary purpose that marriage serves is to secure a mother and father for each child who is born into a society. Now, however, many Westerners see marriage in primarily emotional terms. Among other things, the danger with this mentality is that it fosters an anti-natalist mindset that fuels population decline, which in turn puts tremendous social, political, and economic strains on the larger society. Same-sex marriage would only further undercut the procreative norm long associated with marriage insofar as it establishes that there is no necessary link between procreation and marriage. This was spelled out in the Goodridge decision in Massachusetts, where the majority opinion dismissed the procreative meaning of marriage. It is no accident that the countries that have legalized or are considering legalizing same-sex marriage have some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. For instance, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada have birthrates that hover around 1.6 children per woman--well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. For national fertility rates, see: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sw.html For more on the growing disconnect between marriage and procreation, see: http://marriage.rutgers.edu/Publications/SOOU/SOOU2003.pdf 8. Same-sex "marriage" would further diminish the expectation of paternal commitment. The divorce and sexual revolutions of the last four decades have seriously undercut the norm that couples should get and stay married if they intend to have children, are expecting a child, or already have children. Political scientist James Q. Wilson reports that the introduction of no-fault divorce further destabilized marriage by weakening the legal and cultural meaning of the marriage contract. George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate and an economist, found that the widespread availability of contraception and abortion in the 1960s and 1970s, and the sexual revolution they enabled, made it easier for men to abandon women they got pregnant, since they could always blame their girlfriends for not using contraception or procuring an abortion. It is plausible to suspect that legal recognition of homosexual civil marriage would have similar consequences for the institution of marriage; that is, it would further destabilize the norm that adults should sacrifice to get and stay married for the sake of their children. Why? Same-sex civil marriage would institutionalize the idea that children do not need both their mother and their father. This would be particularly important for men, who are more likely to abandon their children. Homosexual civil marriage would make it even easier than it already is for men to rationalize their abandonment of their children. After all, they could tell themselves, our society, which affirms lesbian couples raising children, believes that children do not need a father. So, they might tell themselves, I do not need to marry or stay married to the mother of my children. James Q. Wilson, The Marriage Problem. (Perennial, 2003) 175-177. George A. Akerlof, Janet L. Yellen, and Michael L. Katz, "An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States." Quarterly Journal of Economics CXI: 277-317. 9. Marriages thrive when spouses specialize in gender-typical roles. If same-sex civil marriage is institutionalized, our society would take yet another step down the road of de-gendering marriage. There would be more use of gender-neutral language like "partners" and--more importantly--more social and cultural pressures to neuter our thinking and our behaviors in marriage. But marriages typically thrive when spouses specialize in gender-typical ways and are attentive to the gendered needs and aspirations of their husband or wife. For instance, women are happier when their husband earns the lion's share of the household income. Likewise, couples are less likely to divorce when the wife concentrates on childrearing and the husband concentrates on breadwinning, as University of Virginia psychologist Mavis Hetherington admits. E. Mavis Hetherington and John Kelly, For Better or For Worse. (W.W. Norton and Co., 2002) 31. Steven Rhoads, Taking Sex Differences Seriously (Encounter Books, 2004). 10. Women and marriage domesticate men. Men who are married earn more, work harder, drink less, live longer, spend more time attending religious services, and are more sexually faithful. They also see their testosterone levels drop, especially when they have children in the home. If the distinctive sexual patterns of "committed" gay couples are any indication (see above), it is unlikely that homosexual marriage would domesticate men in the way that heterosexual marriage does. It is also extremely unlikely that the biological effects of heterosexual marriage on men would also be found in homosexual marriage. Thus, gay activists who argue that same-sex civil marriage will domesticate gay men are, in all likelihood, clinging to a foolish hope. This foolish hope does not justify yet another effort to meddle with marriage. Steve Nock, Marriage in Men's Lives (Oxford University Press, 1998).

      "Finding a Needle in the Ocean" fHomosexuality and the Politics of Truth by Jeffrey Satinover, M.D. Book Excerpt...      As you will recall, there are three disputed propositions at the heart of the debate over homosexuality today: Homosexuality is normal; Homosexuality is innate, or inherited; Homosexuality is irreversible. In this chapter and the three that follow we will address the second point: "Is homosexuality innate and inherited?" As we will, see the very way the question has been framed by gay activism and its media promoters contributes seriously to our confusion. Defining Our Terms Let us start by defining our terms. When we analyze and discuss the causes of a given behavioral trait, we find that each cause belongs to one or more of the following categories: Genetic Genetic traits are those (like eye color, for example) that are coded for us by genes. We can think of each human gene as a book that provides a complex set of instructions for the synthesis of a single protein. These proteins are then responsible for forming and operating everything else in the body. The entire collection of genes that provides codes for a human is vast. Therefore it is divided into twenty-three pairs of matched, physically distinct structures called chromosomes. We can think of them as matching libraries that contain and catalogue two copies of every required "book" (gene) in a specific order that does not vary from person to person. Chromosome libraries exist in pairs because each person actually has two instructional genes for every protein, receiving one of every gene from his mother and another from his father. The unvarying order in which the genes are catalogued allows each one of the millions and millions of genes to be matched to its proper companion during reproduction. Any genetic trait inherited from our parents may be: Expressed, as when the gene that codes for it is dominant and we have inherited at least one such gene from each parent (brown eyes; brown is dominant); or as when the gene that codes for it is recessive and we have inherited the same gene from both parents (blue eyes; blue is recessive). Not expressed, as when the gene that codes for it is recessive and we have inherited that gene from only one parent (brown eyes; blue is recessive and therefore not expressed). Partially expressed, as when—whether the gene that codes for it is dominantor recessive—one or more other genes or other factors influences its expression. We may or may not have some or all of these other genes, or we may be only partially exposed to these other factors (green eyes). Genetic traits are truly and directly inherited. All traits with which we are born tend to be put into this category, sometimes incorrectly, such as those that are innate but not genetic. Understanding behavioral traits influenced by genetics becomes more complex. Unlike simple traits, such as eye color, that are close to being programmed by a single gene, most behavioral traits with a genetic background are programmed by multiple genes. Because these genes are rarely inherited together, their possible forms of expression fall into a complex spectrum. Behavioral traits that are influenced by genetics are therefore never eitherlor conditions. Innate Some traits may be merely innate, meaning the individual is born with them. But innate traits may be: Genetic, as outlined above; or Not genetic, but caused by intrauterine influences. These are traits (such as the degree to which a fetus develops masculine or feminine sexual characteristics) that are influenced by various aspects of the environment in the womb. Hormones, infections, exercise, general health, the ingestion of licit or illicit drugs, and many other variables influence this environment. Thus one may be born with a trait that is innate, but not genetic. Familial Other causes of traits may be familial, meaning that they tend to be shared by members of the same family. Familial traits may be: Genetic. Because they have the same parents, brothers and sisters are more likely to share a high percentage of similar genes than would unrelated individuals. Innate, but not genetic. Sharing the same mother, certain typical factors may remain constant or similar for all children born to her. Examples include the effect of her dietary habits on her unborn children, the fact that she smokes, or her general health. Not innate, but environmental. To an extent greater than between individuals from different families, individuals raised in the same family share a similar environment. These include the physical, emotional, and moral influences. Thus family members may share some traits that are neither genetic nor innate but that are nonetheless transmitted from one generation to the next by influence. Biological Another term that may be used to describe a trait is biological. A biological trait is rooted in an organism's physiology, rather than its psychology. With respect to behavioral traits, this distinction suggests a dichotomy comparable to the difference between "hardware" and "software" in the domain of computer science. Biological traits may be: Genetic; or Innate but not genetic; or Environmental and familial but not innate (for example, the effect of a virus that has taken root among the members of a household); or Environmental and not familial and possibly innate but maybe not (for example, the effect of a toxin in the environment at large, depending on whether its baleful influence is felt pre- or postnatally). Environmental Additionally, the cause of a trait may be purely environmental but not biological, at least insofar as we do not attend to the biological dimension. Examples include the influence on behavior of the values, standards, habits, economic status, and so on, of a family or society. Direct versus Indirect Finally, any of these causes may be direct or indirect. That is, the cause may: Lead directly to the trait. Whether we are speaking of genetic or nongenetic, innate or noninnate, biological or nonbiological influences, the cause may directly produce the trait itself, as when genes cause blue eyes or when smoke causes a cough. Lead indirectly to the trait. Because of what the influence causes directly, the individual finds it desirable to choose a particular trait. This is seen, for example, when tall athletic individuals become basketball players or when short athletic people become jockeys. Furthermore, all of these causes may combine and influence one another in highly interdependent ways, mutually influencing each other throughout a lifetime. Behavioral traits, as opposed to simple, single-gene physiologic traits such as eye-color, always interact in this way. In summary, the question concerning all behavioral traits, such as homosexuality, cannot be "Is such and such genetic?" Rather we must ask, "To what extent, respectively, is such and such genetic and nongenetic, innate and noninnate, familial and nonfamilial, environmentally determined and not, direct and indirect? In the course of development, when do which influences dominate and how do their interactions affect one another?" We need to keep this sobering caution in mind as we clarify what medical science has and has not learned about the subject of homosexuality. Unanswered Questions Most mental states, normal or not, have long been presumed to be of psychological origin because we have not been able to understand the biology. We simply did not have the information or skills to intervene in a purported disease of the brain whose primary manifestations were psychological. But neuroscience research techniques have proliferated. We now can dissect out at least some of the specific mechanisms, down to the level of molecules, that play a role in many conditions previously thought to be purely psychological. Although this research has already produced many dramatic benefits, we are far from having a precise blueprint of the various causes of any psychiatric condition. Demonstrating that any behavioral state, let alone one so complex, diverse in its manifestations, and nuanced as homosexuality, is not only biological but genetic is well beyond our present research capacity. One psychiatric researcher who was tired of the overblown claims of people trying to label everything as "genetic," calculated what would be required to confirm a behavioral trait as genetic. He projected that "If the trait was 50 percent heritable and each family in the [initial] study had ten members (4 grandparents, 2 parents and 4 children), detecting one of the genes would require studying . . . 2000 people. Replicating that finding would require studying . . . another 8000 people. To find and confirm each additional gene (for a polygenic trait), researchers would need to go through the whole business again. "Suddenly you're talking about tens of thousands of people and years of work and millions of dollars." No study of homosexuality has come even remotely close to these requirements. In the case of schizophrenia, for instance, such research efforts have only now begun to yield somewhat reliable results after over forty years of effort. But even after so much research, the major questions - Mat causes schizophrenia? How does this illness affect the nervous system? What environmental cofactors are critical to its appearance? What interventions might be curatives.— remain almost entirely unanswered. Different studies claim to show anywhere from 40 to 90 percent heritability for schizophrenia. Researchers have made numerous claims to have found a meaningful "genetic linkage" to a particular chromosome, only being forced to retract them in every case.  urlLink {1}   The vastly more complex problem of finding the genes themselves or the specific DNA base pairs among the millions on the chromosome has been compared to finding a needle, not in a haystack, but in the ocean. What We Can Say In the case of homosexuality, only a handful of barely adequate studies on a small number of people have been conducted in the past few years. We will explore these more fully in the chapters that follow. But first it is important to lay out three important limitations that are already beginning to emerge from this research. All are quite consistent with what we already know about the biological and genetic bases of other conditions. First, like all complex behavioral and mental states, homosexuality is multifactorial. It is neither exclusively biological nor exclusively psychological but results from an as-yet-difficult-to-quantitate mixture of genetic factors, intrauterine influences (some innate to the mother and thus present in every pregnancy, and others incidental to a given pregnancy), postnatal environment (such as parental, sibling, and cultural behavior), and a complex series of repeatedly reinforced choices occurring at critical phases in development. Second, male and female homosexuality are probably different conditions that arise from a different composite of influences. Nonetheless, they have some similarities. Third, "homosexuality" is very poorly defined. Our use of this one term creates the false impression of a uniform "gay" or "lesbian" condition and culture. It obscures the reality that what we are studying is a complex set of variable mental, emotional, and behavioral states that are caused by differing proportions of numerous influences. Indeed, one of the chief characteristics of the gay lifestyle is its efflorescence of styles and types of sexuality. Thus many of the more careful researchers in the field, usually nonactivist, refer to ''homosexucll~ties.'' Do Brain Differences Make a Difference? The belief that homosexuality is "genetic" tends to translate into a more positive attitude toward it. Gay activists know this and research studies confirm it: "To measure the relationship between beliefs about the determinants of homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, we asked 745 respondents in four societies about their beliefs concerning the origins of homosexual orientation. Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that homosexuals are "born that way" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who believed that homosexuals choose to be that way and/or learn to be that way  urlLink {2}  ." Similarly: "One hundred and five . . . subjects . . . were exposed to one of three treatment conditions. Subjects in the experimental group read a summary article of current research emphasizing a biological component of homosexual orientation. Subjects in one control group read a summary article of research focusing on the absence of hormonal differences between homosexual and heterosexual men. Subjects in another control group were not exposed to either article. All subjects completed the Index of Attitudes Toward Homosexuals. As predicted, subjects in the experimental group had significantly lower  urlLink {3}   scores than subjects in the control groups.  urlLink {4}   This "public relations" effect has precipitated a recent media outpouring on the biology and genetics of homosexuality. Starting in 1991, media all across the country have trumpeted the discovery of a series of supposed brain differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals. Commentators claim that these findings will halt any remaining uncertainty that homosexuality is either a choice or a consequence of factors in upbringing. In this light, to continue supporting anything less than full acceptance of homosexual behavior would be proof positive of prejudicial hatred. The outpouring began in August of 1991 when a San Francisco neuroanatomist, Simon LeVay, published an article in Science. It reported his finding that a localized cluster (a "nucleus") of cells in the brains of "homosexual" men was twice as large by volume on autopsy as in "heterosexual" men.  urlLink {5}   ("Homosexual" and "heterosexual" are in quotations because in this study the definitions of each were extremely imprecise, nor was there any way of verifying sexual orientation as the subjects were dead.) But this was not the first such discovery. One year before a group reported in Brain Research that they had found a similar difference—in both volume and number of cells—in a different brain nucleus.  urlLink {6}   The media, however, did not report this first study because Brain Research, unlike Science, is read only by neuroscientists. And in contrast to journalists, the neuroscientists understood the research and its limitations and refrained from grand pronouncements. The specifics of these findings are not as important as realizing that unless group differences are dramatic, individual studies of such differences mean almost nothing. It would take hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such studies before meaningful trends emerge. Thus it is wrong for the media, or parties with vested interests, to argue the significance of something so complex as human nature on the basis of one or a handful of findings and then derive public policy implications. Furthermore, even if such brain differences were convincingly demonstrated to be present, their significance would be on a par with the discovery that athletes have bigger muscles than nonathletes. For though a genetic tendency toward larger muscles may make it easier to become an athlete (and therefore such an individual will more likely be one) becoming an athlete will certainly give one bigger muscles. One researcher comments: "The brain's neural networks reconfigure themselves in response to certain experiences. One fascinating NIH study found that in people reading Braille after becoming blind, the area of the brain controlling the reading finger grew larger."  urlLink {7}   Press accounts, in contrast, are often written so as lead one to assume that brain differences must be innate and unchangeable, especially differences in the number of cells as contrasted with the simple volume occupied by a collection of cells. We tend to think of the mind as "software" and the brain as "hardware," the former plastic and changeable, the latter fixed at birth. We have used this analogy already to good advantage. But the analogy breaks down at a certain point. Various processes go on throughout life: the selective death of brain cells in response to training or trauma, the establishment of new connections between cells, dramatic increases or decreases in the "thickness" of connections between cells as a result of learning, the loss of interneuronal connections through "pruning." Very unlike our modem computers, the brain's software is its hardware. We know from animal studies that early experience and especially traumatic experience that especially applies to the childhood histories of many homosexuals, alters the brain and body in measurable ways. Thus infant monkeys who are repeatedly and traumatically separated from their mothers suffer dramatic alterations in both blood chemistry and brain function.  urlLink {8}   One major theory about why some people become depressed and others do not holds that under conditions of early trauma, a genetically based susceptibility to stress creates a greater likelihood of intense stress-responses later in life.  urlLink {9}   This "vulnerability" is represented physiologically as actual alterations in the brain. And because what is experiences as "stressful" depends on one's subjective interpretation of events, the brains in individuals with the same genetically determined biology may respond differently. One may demonstrate no brain changes; another may demonstrate very significant changes.  urlLink {10}   Thus the editor of Nature commented on the LeVay research: "Plainly, the neural correlates of genetically determined gender are plastic at a sufficiently early stage . . .. Plastic structures in the hypothalamus [might] allow . . . the consequences of early sexual arousal to be made permanent."  urlLink {11}   And of course all this presumes that the research itself was of high quality. But two prominent geneticists, Paul Billings and Jonathan Beckwith, writing in Technology Review (published at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) write: LeVay "could not really be certain about his subject's sexual preferences, since they were dead." His "research design and subject sample did not allow others to determine whether it was sexual behavior, drug use, or disease history that was correlated with the observed differences among the subjects' brains.  urlLink {12}   LeVay's very method of defining homosexuality was very likely to create inaccurate or inconsistent study groups."  urlLink {13}   Because all human behavior is related in some way to genes, we can nonetheless guess that one day higher quality research will find genetic factors that correlate to homosexuality. But remember, one ofthe fundamental principles of research is that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. With respect to whatever genetic or biological factors are correlated to homosexuality we will need to be very careful to understand what they mean and indeed, how limited the implications really are.
