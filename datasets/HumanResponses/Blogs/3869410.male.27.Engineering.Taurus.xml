						   Sometimes I feel that it's not easy to be generous, but somehow tonight I felt a little different. In times that I felt that I'm in need financially or felt that I needed to save money,&nbsp;the&nbsp;unexpected&nbsp;happened -&nbsp;like&nbsp;getting parking tickets and other unnecessary expenses. I feel that God is trying to teach me a lesson, but what do I have supposed to do in a situation when money is tight and I needed to save?   Today is my ex-housemate's birthday&nbsp;and so I&nbsp;invited him for a dinner to celebrate, and indeed I planned to treat him. So I called another friend and 3 of us picked a restaurant and went for dinner... but I didn't plan to be that expensive (probably the most expensive meal that I had in years), and the food was just so-so. The athmosphere was nice and service was excellent, nevertheless. And we also got a delicious cake:)   At the end of the meal, we cut the cake and a buzz-lady (one who cleans the table) cut the cake and brought us the plate. At that time, I felt something in my heart that I should offer her a piece of cake, and so I did.&nbsp;She happily accepted the offer and I could see a&nbsp;happy smile and a&nbsp;bright look in her eyes.   I was reminded of a story that I read many years ago, about someone who gave&nbsp;a big tip to a waitress, and it turned out that it was a&nbsp;life-saving experience&nbsp;for the&nbsp;the waitress. She was in a&nbsp;deep-frustation&nbsp;where&nbsp;she&nbsp;actually plan to&nbsp;end her life&nbsp;once she got home&nbsp;from work. But because someone was being generous that night, she somehow found hope and cancelled her plan.   I was also reminded how happy I was&nbsp;waiting table&nbsp;when someone left&nbsp;me a big tip. Those moments were an experience that I cherished. I still remembered&nbsp;the night when a young couple left me a 50% tip. I thought, wow, it's so much... and I prayed a quick prayer...&nbsp;God... thank you for this couple who left me this tip. In the same way, many of my colleagues cursed the people who didn't leave big tip. I didn't complain when customers didn't leave me a big tip. But as human, we&nbsp;have propensity&nbsp;to honor those generous customers.   On the way home, I passed by my office and I saw my boss' car was still parked there. It was pass 10 p.m. and I felt sorry for him that he had to stay this late and I could not&nbsp;be there to help him.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I just prayed for him a quick prayer that one day he may know Christ and whatever he does here has a purpose. He is a very generous and smart man, and he may not realize it, but he has helped me a great deal financially this past few months. In closing, I want to ask you for a favor, if you believe in Christ, that you also pray for my boss that he will one day receive&nbsp;Christ as his savior.

						   Last memorial day (5/29/04) I had a chance to go back to my University after attending my college buddy's wedding in Atlanta. I've never been back since I graduated in 1998. Many things have changed and the campus is expanding quite rampantly: new buildings here, new dormitories there, and Univ. bookstore, too. It's good to see the campus again, however, I missed the people so much. My classmates and friends and best friends.   In my travel, I always enjoy visiting friends and the people who had touched my life sometimes or once in my lifetime. Among them is my english professor, whom I'm blessed that I've maintained good relationship - almost a decade now. I'm forever thankful that I took his class, even though I was struggling in his english composition class.   So I paid him a visit and it's very good seeing him again. He welcomed me to his cozy home, had a good conversation while cathing up on things. It's kinda sad that he's battling with a cancer now. He knows I'm a believer and so he read it to me a poem which he knows I will like. And I did!!! It's a really nice poem with a prayer, and he sent me that to my email.   As you read the prayer below, please help me pray for my professor (Dr. Glo as you can call him) and also for me. (thanks!)  Here's the prayer part. It's a conversation between Urset and Yahweh: (from the book N. Scott Momaday, In the Bear's House - NY: St. Martin's. 1999) -----------  Urset:  Would you be so kind as to make a prayer for me.  Just now.  For me.  Yahweh:  I pray that you are kept safe throughout this day, that you live as wholly as you can, that you see things that you have not seen before and that more of them are beautiful than not, more of them delightful than not.  I pray that you hold easily in your hands the balance of the earth and sky, that you laugh and cry, know freedom and restraint, some joy and some sorrow, pleasure and pain, much of life and a little of death.  I pray that you are grateful for the gift of your being, and I pray that you celebrate your life in the proper way, with grace and humility, wonder and contentment, in the strong, deep current of your spirit's voice.  I pray that you are happily in love in the dawn and that you are more deeply in love in the dusk.  Amen.  Urset: Amen.  And for you - May the Lord smile upon you each and every day. It's a beautiful prayer, isn't it?

						   The weather was indeed very nice this weekend. On Friday night we had a fellowship in Evita's house in Los Altos with my caregroup fellows. We had satays, good drinks, delicious desserts and good time with new people we just met. Everybody seems happy and smiling. But I also enjoyed the setting very much. We had it under an open sky, surrounded by redwoods, lighted by&nbsp;small flourescent lamps hanging by rope and torches decorated neatly along the fences. Above the stars twinkled brightly. And sometimes, we could hear the breeze. What a nice and wonderful evening.  &nbsp; So after being well-fed, we sat down at the patio and gettting to the purpose. We introduced Indonesia to&nbsp;the people&nbsp;and mentioned true, yet funny facts about Indonesia. I didn't know that Indonesia actually consists of 17,508 islands. I always thought that it was around 13,600 only. Since when we add 4000 more islands? Then we brainstormed on how we can impact Indonesia through businesses for the Kingdom purpose.&nbsp;We&nbsp;closed with a short prayer, but a good one. Some people suggested that we held this meeting monthly... what a good idea, except maybe to the host:) Anyway, thanks Evita and Tim for inviting and the hospitality. I&nbsp;hope that&nbsp;a good team will be formed so believers in Indonesia can be equipped to transform the society.&nbsp;

						   If you like photography, I have good news and bad news&nbsp;for you:) Last night I attended a photography&nbsp;seminar at Stanford and was blown away by&nbsp;this camera developped by Graham Flint. Yes, it's 1,000 Mega Pixel.  &nbsp;  I've never realized that it would be this quick and it's amazing to see how this camera actually performs. Graham presented a photo that he took of Yosemite's half dome&nbsp;from Glacier Point (over&nbsp;2 miles away) and he zoomed in 10,000 times. The result: we could see&nbsp;that&nbsp;people were climbing the dome. How amazing!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So the bad news... of course, it makes our camera looks bad. I wonder if&nbsp;he would&nbsp;accept a trade-in with my 4 MP camera:) If you'd like to read some more information about this, here are the websites:   urlLink www.gigapxl.org &nbsp;and  urlLink http://www.tow.com/photogallery/2004/20040714_coba/   &nbsp;  Enjoy:)

						   A few days ago one of my best friends told me that I need to be more decisive in life.  "Like what?", I said. Then we both stopped and thought about it for a while and laughed. A good input for me indeed. And yes, life has so much to offer and sometimes I find it hard to make a decision. It's not simple...  In times I have decided to do one thing, but then another told me something that simply changed my mind.   That same night I read a book which tells an intriguing Jewish legend regarding the Creation story. It goes like this:  When God was about to create man, He took into His counsel the angels who stood about the throne.  "Don't create him," said the angel of justice, "for if You do, he will commit all kinds of wickedness against his fellow man."  "Don't create him," said the angel of truth, "for he will be false and deceitful to his fellow man - and even to You."  "Don't create him," warned the angel of holiness, " for a man will follow that which is impure in Your sight and dishonor You to Your face."  Then the angel of mercy stepped forward and said, "Create Him, our Heavenly Father, for when he sins and turns from the path of right and truth and holiness, I will take him tenderly by the hand, and speak loving words to him and then lead him back to You."  What an awesome story I think. Both you and I know what God had decided. Personally it has taught me the importance of having a great counsel and to love what is good. It makes it so much easier to make a decission.

						   Early morning is my favorite. I wake up and see the sun shine and feel the freshness of air filling my lungs. I hear the birds chirping and sometimes the sounds of water crashing to the bay banks. And I'm thankful to be given another day and another opportunity to start fresh. This morning I woke up pretty late than usuall so I rushed to the bathroom and grab something for breakfast. As I drove to work, I listened to the radio and this song really touched my heart. It says that let everything about me be "Halleluya" (praise/fragrance) to Him. Indeed I start my morning fresh... and I'm thankful
