      It seems that all I do at the moment is that. After having IT this Monday, and finding it insultingly easy (not to mention containing some interesting (wrong) HTML) I'm hopeful, but English literature on Friday will be far more challenging. I wait with not-so-baited breath (more with tired, bored breath).  ByteHoard is going well - version 2 coding is at a good point, with most of the stuff being modules and plugins, and the base code working nicely.  Until next time.

      After being a bit lazy yesterday, and not updating the blog, I have now returned to once again stun you all with my incredible wit and visionary ideas (well, you have to dream).  I recently came across the idea of plogs - basically, blogs for projects, and I have been deliberating about starting one for ByteHoard. It all depends, really.  On that note, I've decided to start a near-total rewrite of ByteHoard (for the less technical-minded: do lots of extra work) because I'm not too happy about its current state (the code is horrendous). I did this last year, too, and it seemed to do lots of good, and I've already made a lot of progress in three hours, so it's time to stock up on caffeinated drinks, and get to work. Well, tomorrow.  Anyway, until next time...

      I have been thinking about disconnecting from the internet now, as nothing I will ever read will be as good as the story of the p-p-p-powerbook. Really.  Put simply... well, it's hard. Essentially, someone selling a powerbook on EBay found out the buyer was a scammer, and so in lieu of sending the $1500 Powerbook, they decided to send the ultimate in modern notebook computing... the P-P-P-Powerbook! It has no boot time, is one third the weight of a standard laptop, has all the usual connections (including Fire Wire and Circle&trade;), and has a modern A4 screen.  For more info, go to  urlLink http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com/ . I suppose it's my link of the day.  So, to all the scammers out there... Be Warned&trade;.

      Life isn't really the most dynamic thing for me at the moment... while the sun shines brightly, the birds sing in the trees, and Tron Guy gets another TV appearance, I'm bored out of my (rather oddly-shaped) skull. At least I have this blog and the great weather to keep me occupied, but other than that, it's not so good.  After yesterday's experiments with my website, I came up with a reasonable idea which I'm currently implementing. No doubt I'll have more to say about that soon.  Until then... be... erm... happy? OK?

      Sounds like a film title, doesn't it? Anyway, it's sort of representative of what I feel like at the moment - some of the time I just feel plain lazy, and sit down, watch the TV and eat (mind you, I need to, being underweight. Well, that's my excuse). Other times, like now I suppose, I feel full of energy and will do several things at once (I'm thinking about having a go at the website again, the dark blue Blogger theme has me inspired once again). Then, later on, I'll probably relax into some sort of half-asleep state and try and watch Tarrant On TV (a Japanese special tonight - what a televisual treat).  Luckily, I have my new tech toys to play with during my periods of boredom, and some old films (WarGames! Argh!) and five seasons of STTNG lying around the house, along with a large library of (mostly) unlabelled tapes... It's like the video equivalent of the Lucky Dip. I found Innerspace yesterday, which was an OK film, but there's quite a few Doctor Who tapes lurking in there, with latex monsters and 1960s special effects to give you that blast from the past.  Anyway, enough typing, off to play around with my website in Quanta. Hopefully something better will emerge today.

      Hmm. I tried redesigning my website, but to no avail. It still looks too angular and contrasts too much, so I'll stay with the old design for now.  Today hasn't been great; I somehow managed to get my versions of Qt and kdelibs mixed up, leving me with a very basic desktop. Thankfully, a quick download of some packages and some reinstalling fixed that, and I am now happily typing away in konqueror again.  I sometimes am amazed that my computer is running about 2GB of code mostly programmed by people in their spare time, for the good of the community, and that it works so well. Mind you, I suppose the same can be applied to some people using what I create.  Anyway, until next time...

      Well, time to get on with the next part of the blog, I guess. Not much has happened yet, as you would probably expect, and the ubiquitous revision still lies ahead on today's schedule.  Perhaps now is the time for some more introduction. As I mentioned previously, I am the creator and lead developer (and any other fancy title I can come up with) of a project called ByteHoard. It's a way of storing files via the web using just a browser to upload, download, delete and wreak havoc on your files. I started it back last September (I think, it was a while ago and I can be bothere to check the release dates), and it has grown far more than I expected it to, with willing volunteers coming in to help code and translate, which, for me, is a powerful vision of the Open Source development methodology.  In other news, the title of this blog, which I thought up last night while looking randomly through a thesaurus (my way of naming things), has given me a much better title for my website, so I can now go and update/redesign it. I have a terrible thing with my homepages - no one homepage seems to last for longer than a month or two, mostly because of my improving coding skills and (weak, I admit) sense of style.  Since I'm now on study leave (and then on holiday) until next September, and only going in for exams for about 15 days during that time, I have a lot of free time on my hands, which I should really spend all of revising, but so far in my life I've found that revising the week/night before is a remarkably good tactic, for me at least. So this leaves me with time to get on with this blog, work on ByteHoard, my website, and anything else I feel like, and relax watching the TV. I hope.  Finally, let me point you to a few websites. If you don't know about Open Source software, then go to  urlLink www.opensource.org . It's not the prettiest website out there, and is a bit cryptic, but will get the idea across, hopefully. And my website of the day is  urlLink Something Awful  - it's not politically correct, it's not suitable for the under 12s, but it made me laugh until I had to go and inject myself with sedative.

      That's always the subject of my first posts on my new projects, and now this. Anyway, let me welcome you, if you're here (which I suppose you must be) and warn you now that this blog will be just a tad geeky, and full of bad humour and puns.   That said, let me introduce myself.  I'm a student in the UK, and am currently about to take my GCSEs, and then go on to take my A levels (all six of them...). Don't let that fact prejudice you against me - whenever I reveal how old I am after talking with people over the Internet, I get varying responses, including people looking down to me, people who don't care, and people who are somewhat taken aback.   I am an avid programmer, and can write in many languages, although I am best in PHP (and HTML, of course). I'm also an avid Open source fan (sorry, make that zealot, my mistake), and run Gentoo Linux as my OS of choice. I'm sure I'll be talking about that a lot in the upcoming posts.  I administrate an Open Source project called ByteHoard, which I am foreseeing becoming a common topic in future posts - I put a lot of work into it, and so get some frustrations out of it.  I'm also interested in graphic design, play the violin, and have a somewhat positive outlook on life, which really helps on some days. I also talk gibberish half of the time, and the other half I'm probably talking about some aspect of science, computers, art, music, or perhaps religion.  I suppose I should stop writing soon, with it being about ten in the evening, but no doubt you'll be hearing more about me here soon.  And remember, imagination is stronger than knowledge. Well, apparently. Don't quote me on that.
