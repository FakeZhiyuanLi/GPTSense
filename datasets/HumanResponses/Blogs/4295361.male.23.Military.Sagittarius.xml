       Alright, since this blogging thing is new to me I'm a bit hyped about it so here I am again. This will be one of many, many complaints about unreasonable buying habits. This one is in regards to sport utility vehicles. By this time most people either love them or hate them and the reasons behind each side are already well known. The anti-SUV crowd hates them because of the pollution factor and the serious danger of head-on impacts against smaller cars. The pro-SUV crowd loves them because of their versatility (if any), their interior space (oddly lacking in many models) and their safety (yeah, if rolling over is safe and fun). As you can probably see I'm more in line with the anti-Stupid Unneccesary Vehicle crowd. Surprisingly however, it is not for the obvious reasons. I can't say pollution because I have a boat and a few Seadoo's in the family and frankly they get the worst mileage of anything out there. I can't really talk about danger, because even though they are very large, a drunk bastard driving a Geo Metro is more dangerous than some soccer mom cruising through the suburbs...unless of course said soccer mom is racing to the field to purse-slap the coach because he said something critical about her precious child's inability to do anything constructive with the ball. For the record, I suck at soccer myself, but I don't lose sleep and dignity over it. Wow, see how easy I get off subject? You'll see more of that I'm sure.       Yes, yes, about SUV's and why I'm not big on them. Call it a flaw, but I've always believed that people will be happier and more economically free if they make purchases based a little more on rationality and less on penis-enhancement for the men and empowerment for the women. Yes, not every guy out there who drives an SUV is compensating...but most of them are and you know who you are needle-dick. As for the women, well...a great deal of them are tragically disrespected by the men in their lives and they feel a total loss of power. Like it or not, driving a big vehicle is a status symbol in this country and it seems that a lot of women love SUV's because they are like a big cozy shield against the hateful world, and they can run down their problems with a large and obnoxious rolling wall of steel. How do I know this? I talk to a lot of people and I read quite a lot so eat it. By the way, to be fair, a lot of men feel this lack of power also and are just as guilty. I may attack the sexes frequently, but never with inequality.      Here is my simple look at things, to make it easier. If the only thing you'll ever move 95% of the time is yourself or a gym bag or some college supplies or even a few adults and their luggage, all you need is a damn car. Hear that? Get a Honda Accord (one of which I own and will declare to my last breath is about the most car anyone will ever need), a Mazda 6, a Chevy Malibu, a Toyota Camry, a Subaru Legacy...any midsize sedan. Preferably, stay away from GM or Ford. Resale does matter sometimes. On the opposite end, if you really need to haul something like a boat or a camper and some seriously dirty workers and their respective equipment, by all means buy a truck. The miles per gallon probably won't be good, but at least you are utilizing a specific vehicle for a specific purpose. Actually, to be safe, always buy based on towing. If you know you're never going to tow anything, just get a car. A car can always handle dirty workers. Just clean it like any self-respecting owner of something valuble.      The problem with SUV's is that they rarely offer enough sport (top heavy, considerable understeer) or utility (small interior dimensions to exterior size ratio, expense makes them poor off road contenders) to be worthwhile. Sure they look nice, but the company has to have a way of concealing the fact that you're buying a steel block slapped onto a truck chassis. I find it odd that many SUV dealers are not located anywhere near farms, and yet you can always hear mooing around them. The dealership is the slaughterhouse and the SUV's are the blades. I love my Accord, and I'm sure you cherish your Navigator, but I'm willing to bet that I can get from point A to point B faster, using a lot less gas, moving a similar amount of people, hauling similar amounts of luggage, and looking just as classy as you.       So in the end, don't tell me you need a mini-bus with 4-wheel drive because some snow "might" hit at any time. I drove to Troy New York for two years while going to school there and you know what kept me safe while driving a small front-wheel drive 4-cylinder car through all the icy hills of that town? Why, good snow tires and heads-up driving. These are truly the keys to dealing with harsh winter in almost all of the U.S.A.. Just be straight-up. If someone asks you why you purchased an SUV, just say it was for the ego. It's really okay. Don't make up some lame-ass excuse about winter handling and safety. Most of the vehicles in the ditch after a snow storm are SUV's anyway. Just admit you bought it while thinking with the little head and you'll save yourself the shadow of dishonesty.

      Well, if you've found me than you must be looking for those individuals who have a bunch of stuff to say and don't care if it irritates some people or not.  I am one of those people and I have some stuff to spew out there.  Unfortunately, as of the moment, I have no decent pictures to give a visual account of who I am and the things that I'm about.  I've never blogged before, so hopefully I can break up my life into categories and associate some decent images with them because we all know eye candy is sweeter than words.  Me, and ya'll, will just have to see.  As for me, here is a quick overview.  I am a 23 year old member of the New York Air National Guard and a recent graduate of SUNY Buffalo.  Like thousands of other people I ended up wanting to do something different than what I went to school for.  What was my degree in, you ask?  Media, I answer.  Not an uninteresting major, to be truthful, but not the most in-demand one for the job market.  I don't much care though.  Sometimes we all go through changes regarding what we want to do.  Law enforcement has always interested me as well, and it is a much more stable lifestyle.  It is what I truly want to do and we'll just have to see what happens.  Long process to get in, ya' know?   Anyway, since this is a ranting and raving and (maybe) insightful blog, I'll give an example of my logic.  Keep in mind, these are my opinions only, so of course they are right.  No, let that slide.  Messin' with you partner.  I just like giving advice based on the experiences of my young life.  Hopefully some of it will ring true with you.  Anyway, the present moment's topic includes material goods, wealth, whatever.  Lately, in these days of constant guilt-tripping by the media and advertising, we seem to be obsessed with material wealth.  If you are constantly annoyed by what is parked in the driveway of your neighbors house and you drastically wish you could obtain something as good if not better, here is something you can do.  Stop looking at everyone else's material goods and take a good look at your body.  Pick any part.  In this case, let's make it your arm.  Pull up the sleeve of your new Abercrombie shirt, take off that fake Rolex.  All ready?  Good.  Now, take the hand of your other arm and smack the arm you are holding out.  Feel that?  Feel the warmth of your flesh, the softness?  Feel the sting?  Know what that is?  That's you.  That's the real you.  Not the expensive jewelry you dream of or the nice clothing.  That flesh is the true you, and no one can put a label on it.  Now, don't get me wrong.  It is alright to have nice things.  But if you look in the mirror and see something totally overweight and tired, something that is just existing rather than living, something that has to work 2000 hours a week to pay off all the debt they've accrued from buying a 10 bedroom house and a forty foot SUV, then you've got a problem.  It is the old story of keeping up with Mr. and Mrs. Jones.  Well, stop it.  Those two people suck...and you will never beat them.  For every person driving a Civic, someone has an Accord.  For everyone driving a BMW, someone is piloting a Bentley.  For every Bentley driver, someone has a private jet.  Well, a lot of people who drive Bentley's probably have some type of personal air travel available, so maybe that is a bad example.  But you get my drift dammit.  The bottom line is that the only true measurement of someone is the very person you actually see.  The thing you can put your hands on, wrap your arms around, kiss, hold.  If you are depressed over your physical self, your material self will always be a front.   I suppose that is about all I have to spit out at the moment.  I probably could have been more blunt, but I will be returning to this topic in the future and I'm sure I will be delivering a more in-depth balance between harshness and kindness.  Just wait until I cover relationships.  Anyway, I'll let you alone now, leaving you with my word of the week.  Since it is Friday, I guess I'll just make Friday the day for each weekly word change.     STUPINATE  :  In a nutshell, stupid people copulating and creating wretched offspring.  Drive through your local trailer park.  You'll learn all about it.

      It has been a while since I've been to a gym other than the one on the military base I work at, so I haven't been around a crowd of people working out in some time.  However, after I went to the gym today, I thought that maybe a good section I can create would pertain to weight training.  Now I am by no means someone who could grace the cover of a magazine, at least not yet, but I take my training seriously enough and I know how to get results.  This first short stab will deal with form.  Basically, form is the style in which you do an exercise.  If you've ever been to a gym, chances are good you've seen or at least heard those using bad form.  These are the guys who do the bench press by slamming the bar off their chest while screaming at their buddies about what a great pump their getting.  That will end when they eventually damage their sternum.  Anyway, good form involves concentration, intelligent weight selection, and a steady rhythm.  The second you try to impress someone with the weight you can move, your form will probably suffer.  I'll do a picture or two to show you what I mean.  To be true you can learn about good form from any respectable training magazine, but since I'm not getting paid to do this you can trust that my examples will be more for your gain than mine.

      Maybe it's me, but do people become more dull with age?  I mean, remember being young and having people around all the time?  Maybe you don't, but I do.  Now, the only thing anyone wants to do seems to revolve around nightlife and alcohol.  Both are fun, but they aren't the only damn thing around.  Is there some law that says 23 is the age where everyone becomes serious and going to work at 11 a.m.  (translation=late) means getting to bed by 10 p.m.?  Of course people work, as we all do in one way or another, and it is an important way of establishing yourself.  However, I don't intend on wasting my 20's and 30's slaving away to my job.  It's called balance everyone.  I'm sick of people planning out their lives to every last millimeter.  People who know that they will get married the split second they turn 25 and that their first child will arrive at exactly four in the morning on April 10th 2015.  Life should be a game plan, something flexible to change.  It shouldn't be a hard and set rule spread out to microscopic measurements.  People's lives change so drastically sometimes that being so rigid in your course could be a downfall.  It's like democrats and republicans who are so set in their beliefs that they can never consider the other's opinions.  It leads to total predictability and absolute unoriginality.  So many good people I have known have become dull drones clanking along on the depressing course of their so-called jobs and emotionless relationships.  What happened?
