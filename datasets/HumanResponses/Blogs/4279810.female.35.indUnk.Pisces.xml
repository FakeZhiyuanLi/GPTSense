      I am not a gambler. Never have been. That's because I don't have an addictive personality; obsessive-compulsive, maybe, but not addictive. Nothing that I've ever run across -- at least, so far-- has been so much of a good time that I'd abandon everything else to get it. My father-in-law from my first marriage once took me to Las Vegas and gave me $20 in quarters to run through the slot machines. An hour later, he came back and asked me how much money I had; I said confidently, "Twenty dollars." "Ah, that's great," he said jovially. "You broke even." Nope, I said, and showed him the coin rolls still sitting in my pocket; "I never broke it in the first place." He was much disturbed by this display of reserve and encouraged me to blow it. "It's free and clear," he said. "I gave it to you; you're not losing anything really." "I know," I said, "And I thank you for the gift; but you're right---as long as I keep it in my pocket, it won't get lost." Apparently, I am an oddity in this direction. And you no longer have to go to the desert to place your bets. Even in West Virginia gambling has become an insidiously pervasive force to be reckoned with. The gas station just down the street has over a dozen different kinds of scratch-off tickets to consume your time and your money. And actually more of the latter than anything else, when you get right down to it. It's a seductive proposition: pay me a dollar, and maybe you'll get a hundred in return. It's the ultimate get-rich-quick scheme. And it works -- for the Lottery Commission, anyway. Personally, I'd rather not throw my hard-earned money on another man's game. However, just on a lark, I bought a Keno scratch-off ticket. It costs $2 and offers several different chances to win. It lists a column of numbers down the left side; and on the right side are several boxes of numbers covered up with grey gummy matter. You scratch off the boxes on the right to reveal sets of numbers that may, or may not, match the numbers on the left. Your cash reward depends on how many numbers you match up, and in what combinations. An experienced ticket-scratcher can rip through one Keno ticket in about 45 seconds. I've seen kids open Christmas presents slower. I know whereof I speak. Keep in mind that my mother is a seasoned scratch-off ticket junkie. She keeps a running tally in her head of where she's bought, which places are the luckiest, and which one is currently out of the Lucky Dogs or the Bingo tickets or whatever else happens to be the flavor of the month. The ticket buyers all know each other in an almost cultish way, reading the weekly paper for the most recent list of those who have made it big (or small) so they know who to snub in jealous-hearted disgust the next time they go out. If someone wins it big at the quickie mart, she won't go there for a few weeks because she says it's "unlucky", operating, I presume, on the premise that lightning never strikes twice. She rotates the establishments she frequents and looks down her nose with disdain at the ticket buyers who are so impatient to claim their loot that they scratch off the ticket right there on the counter at the store. This is not only a gross display of poor discipline, but it's rude. They are blocking her way to the cash register, thank you very much. Well, maybe it's catching. I thought maybe I should buy a scratch-off ticket on my own and see what everyone else was on about. The funny thing is, I  won . It was weird, because I never win. The last thing I won was a cakewalk when I was in the 7th grade, and even then my brothers ate most the cake before I could. I won about $17 or so, so I sent my husband and my oldest son back to the grocery store (where I bought it) to have the ticket redeemed. On the way to the store, my son told my husband that he really felt I might have a problem. "No," my husband said, "She doesn't have a problem. She almost never does this." My son said nothing, but observed as the winning ticket was exchanged for $15 and another Keno (hey, if I'm on a roll...). They brought the ticket back and I scratched it off. Unbelievable! I won again. This time, a smaller amount -- $5, or approximate. So I left the house to redeem the ticket again, and my oldest son stood up in the brave, solemn manner of a concerned friend about to do an intervention. "I'm going with you," he said. I brought him along to the gas station ( I felt like ringing the changes a little bit). I walked in, put my ticket on the counter and told the 16-year-old cashier that I wanted to redeem the ticket and get another one for $2 with the winnings. "My mother has a gambling problem," my son blurted out. Heads swiveled. "No, I don't," I said, smiling calmly. "I just want another ticket and the $3, please." "You see," my firstborn said traitorously. "Denial. It's the first sign." "I really don't have  any  idea what you're talking about," I said. " Grandma  gambles. Lots of people we know gamble. I don't gamble." "You keep trading in the tickets," he said stubbornly. "I keep  winning ," I argued. The cashier cleared her throat and smiled at me almost patronizingly. "Sometimes," she said, leaning forward in I'm sure what she thought was a helpful manner, "Our children can see things in us that we can't see in ourselves." "Oh, surely, " I snapped. "That's certainly why I had mine." That was the end of my scratch-off ticket expenditures. My husband still plays the Powerball every Wednesday--the biweekly drawing of numbers. It's a much bigger market and winning is extremely rare. Not too long ago, though, he missed the televised drawing at eleven and asked me to take his ticket to the gas station in the morning to see if he'd actually won anything. I was just approaching the counter the next day when the same teenaged clerk came round and spied the ticket in my hand. "Ah," she said softly. "Gambling again." Now I know why my mother keeps changing where she buys these things.

      I really don't like dentists much. I equate them on about the same level as a car mechanic -- they're expensive, they're overbooked, they're indispensable in emergencies and they know it. Further, it's almost impossible to tell, at first blush, whether or not they're any good at what they do until they open up the hood and take a look around. Just their casual examination and analysis requires a certain level of trust and surrender on my part that I simply don't have. I have never visited the same dentist more than twice; not necessarily because I've ever been to a terrible dentist, but I don't deem it prudent to let a man see you scream any more often than that without serious repercussions. So I don't personally endorse the biannual dental cleaning. Hey, I have somewhat of a obsessive-compulsive personality. No one is going to clean my teeth as well as I do. Believe me. However, my issues with all things dental do not transcend to my children. I took them to the dentist for their annual cleanings feeling industrious, productive and, I'll admit it, a little smug. Dental appointments are the rite of passage of childhood, are they not? Who can't remember going to the dentist as a kid? I went, certainly, but only because my parents put a glass of Tang by my bedside every night so I'd stop nagging them for water, and my mother mixed the Tang with sugar thinking it would taste tart without it. (Judging from the overweening concern she displays for my kids now--- trial lawyers for the ACLU should fight as vigorously as  she  does on my children's behalf when I'm attempting to mete out discipline-- my mother spends a lot of time worrying about how it feels to be a kid.) Good intentions notwithstanding, I had 14 cavities at my first dental appointment. Perhaps to compensate, I am a strict no-sugar parent. I don't believe in candy and cookies for kids. I'm so strict about it that my family and friends sneak treats to the kids on the side, and their manner is as stealthy as a drug dealer's. "Here, kid. ...You want a cookie? Eat it, fast, kid, before she comes back." Some people have dogs under the table at dinnertime waiting for scraps. I have grandparents down there, armed with Toll House cookies and slipping reinforcements up under the tablecloth while I'm passing the butter. Despite this high-ranking betrayal in my troops, I was not prepared when the dentist took me aside after examining the kids' mouths and said, "If you were  my  daughter, I would take you out back and beat you for letting that four-year-old's mouth get so rotten."  What ? He proceeded to lecture me on the evils of sugar, and how much sugar actually exists in a can of soda. He even had a prop; a small Tupperware container filled with about a cup and a half of white sugar, which he tilted around for emphasis while he was talking. Obviously, after looking around in Ted's mouth he assumed that I was raising my children on Pixy Stix and lemon drops. I looked to my children to back me up on this, but they were much diverted by the red helium balloons the hygenist had handed out. Great, one more thing to bat out of my line of vision while I'm trying to drive home. As if three kids and a Jack Russell terrier isn't enough. Then he charged me $60 for the nitrous oxide he would have to use at the next visit, since the kid is so young and impressionable. He didn't want the boy to feel scarred by his first dental drilling. No, it's much better to gas him, I'm sure.  After conducting exhaustive surveys on other parents I have come to learn that the fitness of tooth enamel is as variable as presidential convictions on foreign policy. Not unlike the Pill and other highly touted forms of routine prevention, dental hygiene is excellent, but somewhat unreliable. Some kids have enamel as impermeable as a bicycle helmet. Others have teeth that dent like bubble gum at the first taste of fructose. There really is only so much you can do, and the rest is up to the Tooth Fairy, or whoever. Though my kids don't believe in the Tooth Fairy, either. That myth was dispelled posthaste when I wrote the oldest kid a check for the last tooth that fell out. (It was that or a credit card, all right?) For $60 and some verbally abusive lecturing, what we got out of the dental appointment was a gift certificate for free french fries at McDonald's and battery-operated toothbrushes for the kids. Now when they're in there brushing before bedtime, I hear an electric whirr in there and  every time  I have a confused moment where I imagine they're all in there shaving. Then I remember: now we have a dentist, which is just a formal way of saying we have retained the services of a man who gasses my kids, bores holes in their molars and then implies that I'm the one with questionable character qualities--at $60 a head.  Say no more.

      People always seem amazed when they learn I have three boys. I don't understand this. Sure, I would have liked to have a girl, but having boys is great. Girls like to diet, argue with their mothers and buy atrociously expensive evening gowns for school dances that end up getting worn once and never again ("because everyone would know"). Boys just like to tear stuff up. What's not to like about that? I took the boys to McDonald's yesterday afternoon. We went through the drive-up, asked for three Happy Meals (with Hot Wheels, not Polly Pockets) and then parked in the lot and ate in the car. This sounds cruel, but it is necessary. I've given up on that admonition to let my children experience random environments. No. It does not work. The willingness to subject myself to routine disgrace and public humiliation is not a facet of my personality. My kids eat in the backseat of my car better than they eat in the comfort of my own kitchen. I have given serious consideration to serving all my meals in the car. Maybe it's the seat belts that make the difference. It's hard to refuse to eat when you're belted in. This has its drawbacks, though. My in-laws took my children out to dinner in a real Italian restaurant this summer with their other grandchildren, and conducted a poll round the table as they were waiting for their meals; what's your favorite place to eat? Everyone else had a prompt response: "The Olive Garden." "Bob Evans." My four-year-old bit his lip, thought about it, and volunteered: "The gas station!" My boys were disgusted to find, upon opening the Happy Meals, that they'd been given Polly Pocket toys with their burgers and fries. I had specified twice I needed the boys' meals, but still we ended up with girly-toys in the bags. C'mon, even I would rather have the Hot Wheels car than a Polly Pocket. My Preteen snarled (a verb he's perfecting to the highest art form) that we ought to run over the Polly Pocket as a form of protest. After a moment's thought, I turned off the ignition, picked up one of the perky Pollys, and got out of the car to place it squarely under my left front tire. I got back in the car and looked around; the mirth amongst my children was uncontrollable. I started the car and rolled it forward ever so slightly, then back again. I felt the subtle bump under the wheel as the doll got rolled. The kids were really excited. This was science. I got out and picked up the doll; nothing. Polly was perfectly intact, bearing only a gritty smudge on her left cheek. It was incredible. Only my mother's bread loaves are that impervious to the four-ton weight of a moving car. A discussion ensued about physics, plastic polymers and Grandma's cooking skills. Hey, that's fun for the whole family.

      I once asked a nurse in New York with many children how she managed to teach them such good manners. Her children seemed really remarkably well behaved, even in restaurants. She said that from the time they were infants, she made a habit of taking them out in public as often as possible and in as many different situations she could so that they would learn, naturally, how to behave among others. At the time, I was still a college student and had no experience with which to gauge this information. Now, however, though I believe that is a good practice -- it certainly works for training puppies -- I can report that I've tried this exercise, with rather disappointing results. Of course, I was the one who said I'd never have kids. I didn't babysit when I was a teenager and only stayed with other people's children if it was a true emergency. Not that I dislike children; I love them. But I was too busy trying to look like an adult to spend any more time than I had to with people who still lived in the place I'd just come from. I still get excited about other women's pregnancies, as long as they're not my own. I imagine there are many men out there who say the same thing. Childhood is scary enough without inflicting it on someone else. Or at least, that was always my philosophy. So when I had my children, I didn't feel burdened or angry; I just felt fear, that they would grow up feeling as overwhelmed or clueless as I often did. There are so many dangers to protect them from. No, anger was not an emotion I felt upon my induction into parenthood. The anger comes later, when you're navigating a shopping cart with two toddlers and a pre-pubescent who's perpetually embarassed by the words and actions of everyone else in the family. The two-year-old is punching me in the arm, the four-year-old is babbling and sticking his tongue out at his brothers, and the Preteen is demanding belligerently why I don't  do  something about this egregious behavior? He was never allowed to act like this in a store--do I just love him less than the others? No, I answer. Right now I dislike all of you equally. An elderly couple behind me in the checkout is tsk-tsking and I can feel their weighty disapproval boring through my back as all three kids pounce on the candy bar rack and start whining for treats of their own. The more I refuse the more outrageous the demands get; my young have not yet learned the subtle art of bargaining. The two-year-old, Ben, is wailing because he's had to surrender the book he's been clutching since he snatched it off the shelf when we walked in the store. There is a protracted, excruciating period of time that we must endure of red-faced, tears-streaming squalls as the clerk slides the book over the laser to ring it up, and of course, the price doesn't register and she must do it again and again. Ben is so angry that he begins to rise up out of his perch at the top of the cart, scrabbling for the clerk, and begins punching numbers on the ATM/credit card keypad in futile attempts to retrieve the book. Meanwhile, the four-year-old takes Ben's cue and stands up in the cart himself to lean over and pinch the Preteen, who whirls around angrily, shoves his brother and launches into an inspired tirade about how mortifying it is to live in a family of animals. "They sicken me," he is muttering as the clerk all but throws the book at me herself in self defense to keep Ben at bay. As I am writing out the check the elderly man behind me in line clears his throat with a knowing look at his wife and says, "Bet you can't wait until it gets dark at your house, huh?" I sign my name to the check and answer, "Who waits until dark? They all go to bed at 7." The clerk reminds me to sign up for the drawing before I leave--- the store will be giving away a car. This sounds attractive, naturally, so I say, "Great, I'll do that. I could use a new car." Immediately the clerk and the patrons around me begin to snicker. "What, you've  seen  my car?" I joke, and they just laugh harder. I don't understand the response, but then again, people have laughed at things I've said before that I didn't find especially funny. On the way out of the store I stop to fill out the ticket for the drawing. Featured on the posterboard is the car they're giving away--- a black Mustang pedal car for kiddies.

      Truth is a dangerous quest. One should be wary of setting out to discover the truth; it will almost invariably be a vicious animal. Like snapping turtles and other wild game, the truth is best served up warm, with lots of extra ingredients to make it taste better. Even more dangerous than seeking truth in all things is to risk going to the grocery store without any makeup. The one time that I run to the Shop 'n Save to pick up a supersize pack of Pull-Ups and a gallon of milk will be the only occasion that I manage to run into every single person I ever met, spoke to, shook hands with or borrowed a DVD from and never returned because someone used it for a coaster last month. What's more, bitter experience has taught that when one neglects the finer points of grooming, the verbal ability to defend oneself against any assassinations of character immediately vanishes. Also, that would be almost asking to run into my mother, who would exclaim in a horrified way, "Sharon.  You are letting yourself go . " So I wash my hair and put on makeup, because you never know what could happen. I put a bandanna in my hair so that I resemble either a cast member from Hee-Haw or a rap singer and am content with that look (even though I'm 35, it works) until my 4-year-old angrily identifies the bandanna as the missing handkerchief from his cowboy suit, and demands it back. He also feels it necessary to frisk me before I leave the house for any other toys I may have confiscated for personal use. Trust is not, perhaps, an integral element in this family. Speaking of which, I remember to check my wallet before I get in the car. More than once I have been caught at the checkout with a checkbook as gaptoothed as a six-year-old's smile and discovered that my cash had long been spirited away to far more interesting venues. My purse seems to operate as a sort of loosely managed bank for everyone else, with few deposits and outright embezzlement going on under my own nose. There are moments in a person's life when they must stop and examine how it is they came to this particular station. I must ask myself how I came to this; wearing a headpiece from a child's costume, looking for the money that I thought I had yesterday but now don't. These are serious questions, and I need to explore them. But not too closely. The truth is a dangerous animal, and I feel too thin-skinned to go after it today.

      I believe miracles can happen to anyone if the expectations are low. A penny in the street is a miracle if you're willing to be grateful for the happenstance of cheap currency. These are the tenets on which I build my faith and hope in humanity. If I go to the grocery store and my youngest son Ben doesn't do a striptease in the canned goods aisle, throwing his tank top into the face of a random shopper, I find myself relieved and thankful.  I am a mom. I wasn't always a mother. I was once a creative, inspired person who slept in until 10 a.m. and radiated beatific peace and joy to all who knew me. Sleep, I've found, does wonders for the personality. I am still creative and inspired, but am now tense and edgy with the attention span of a ferret. Is it the fallout of sleep deprivation after birthing three boys, or the side effects of the coffee I swim in daily to combat the sleep deprivation? Film at eleven.  Today I had an appointment to register the four-year-old for preschool. Preschool is now the new kindergarten, and kindergarten is the new first grade. In my day, kindergarten was a very comfortable proposition. Some group play, some mild coloring, and then down for a nap on your blanket. Upon waking, we were served cookies and milk, patted on the head and sent home again. Kindergarten now is an uberfest of academic decathalons and lessons in deportment. Preschool screening involves rigorous standards for mental and physical fitness, up to and including requiring a recitation of the Gettysburg Address and at least a rudimentary grasp of second-order differential equations. A critical discernment of the difference between primary and secondary colors is preferred. Most of the 4-year-olds standing in the hallway with us awaiting registration appeared tense and uncertain about what awaited them. I could understand. One set of parents ushered in their son as he checked his steps, dragging his feet. "Are you ready, buddy?" the father asked jovially, and the child answered with great hesitation, "I'm not sure." The parents all seemed to know each other, and I didn't know anybody. No one spoke to us. I was thinking, however, that if we'd brought the youngest we would have livened up the atmosphere considerably. There's nothing like a toddler who likes to take off all his clothes to remind everyone present that childhood has its own certain freedoms, not the least of which is the occasional thumbing of convention no matter what current trends of thought may be.
