        urlLink    Well, since this is a new blog (Web Log), I thought I'd stick on a recent photo of me. This was taken a month ago by my gorgeous girlfriend Donna at the Elton John concert at Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen. We were trying to amuse ourselves between the support band finishing and Sir Reginald Dwight (Elton John) coming onstage and thought pulling silly faces was a great way to pass time. Well, hope it gives you something to laugh at anyway.

      I don't know if the non-sports fans out there have been paying any attention to this whatsoever or even sports fans for that matter, but what's with all this publicity about Sven Goran Eriksson, his boss (Mark Palios) and their horny, middle-aged little secretary all about? Since when was it a crime for an unmarried man to have a fling with an unmarried woman? Both Sven and Mark saw this woman at different periods of time (Which isn't a crime in Scotland, but obviously seems to be in England) and have admitted having a relationship with Faria Alam (Real name?). Faria Alam has also confirmed that she had a relationship with both men. Fine, no mis-understanings there then. But wait a minute, that's not right - A national football team manager having a relationship with an attractive woman - somebody call the News Of the World. Despite dwindling sales of this 'comedy' paper, they've obviously dished out big bucks on this farcical story to try and have a last ditch attempt to boost paper sales and give us all something to talk about for 10 minutes. So, after occupying the news for the last week and a half, wasting a whole load of people's time (Sven, the FA, the British public, infact everyone not working for the News of the World who I'll bet have now made quite a tidy sum from this little escapade) and an inquiry later it turns out that Eriksson is actually not guilty of anything at all (What exactly was was he accused of again?). Perhaps this is just the News of the World's little prank on the English football team after getting knocked out of Euro 2004 by Portugal on penalties, again. Comments, please.

        "Is this thing on???"     Hello and welcome to the Daily Stu (As oposed to the Daily News), a blog site created by my good self, Stuart MacIntosh, a 20 something student from Aberdeen, Scotland. This blog (Or diary) is intended as humour and satire, aimed at promoting free-speech on the net (Oh, I'm not one of those people am I) and the right to say things you might not like, like why I think President George Bush should be sentenced for War crimes and waging an illegal war. As regularly as I can, I shall be logging on here with a view at creating an opinion on news that is unbiased and tells it from all angles. You guys can let me know if I'm doing a good job or not, or even just have a discussion about it. Also, feel free to send me e-mails with stories of your own and I shall post them (Taking Personal credit for them, obviously) if they are funny, or you just want a rant for other people to see. I hope you enjoy this site, don't take it too seriously and happy reading.  Stuart.
