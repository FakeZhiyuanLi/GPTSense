      ok, it's 8am.  I am going to have a productive day today.  out the door by twelve, tanning, gym and loser work.  I want out of there so bad.  this is what Mikey Tomassi sent me via e-mail yesturday:  its amazing how my feelings for you only go stronger with each day.  yes, it is amazing, isn't it?  well, then again, it's me, so maybe not...

      I thought i posted this morning, but it looks like I didn't.    Alas, i have done nothing of value.  my life stinks.  I am at job 2 of 2 and I'm bored out of my mind and at risk of being found online by the boss man.    i spent the weekend sleeping and did not touch my story as I had planned.  got plans tonight as well and I think the young mr. mike tomassi wants to sleep over, leaving me no time this week to prepare for saturday and finish my story.  unless I wake up at like 2 am and sneak out of bed, which is a possibility I think...

      Yesturday, I resigned my commision as trainer for the restaurant.  it's not a complete notice like I had wanted, but removing my vested interests in  that job felt completely relieving, and though it was a step backward there, I feel it is a step foward overall.   A few hours after, I felt kinda bad about it.  I am sure there will be repercussions that will follow soon after, because that's the kind of people I work for.  But I am trying to mentally prepare myself for them.  The blow won't be so big, and hopefully it will help motivate me further to leave.  I haven't touched my story like I had wanted this weekend either.  I have obligated myself to spend time with some friends, and Mikey will for sure want to see me later tonight.  I was wondering if I could tell him, I'd rather have tonight "off."  I don't think I can.  but I for sure have tomorrow afternoon off, and then I am going to see Liz.  that should be fun.  haven't seen her in forever.

      yesturday was a yank.  I spent all day rewriting my cover letter for this job I really wanted.  went out and bought matching envelopes for my high-end printer paper, went to my restaurant to copy writing samples onto it, only to discover that it didn't translate from the copier to the paper, and I didn't know what to do because the postman came at five and I really wanted it to go out and I just threw the clippings into the envelope, which was overstuffed and it looked awful, and then I had a disagreement with one of my bosses and then when I got home, my friend, who used to be a carreer counselor left me an e-mail, making many notations on my new cover letter that he felt needed to be changed, which of course, I already decided to send out b4 getting his opinion and then I got an e-mail for someone telling me that I may need to be wary of HIV because some guy I hung out with in California...... YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  UUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGG  so, I am kinda worn down by the whole thing.

      check me out, I've added a comments feature, now all one and a half of you who actually read my blog can tell me what you think.  FUN!  I am a regular computer programmer.  don't be jealous.  So, recent update, I have really taken a huge stride in writing the completed draft of "Adopting the Poetry in a Kansas Song Soap Opera" however, I am still on page 2 of 19.  I have a really good feeling about this story if only I could find the time to really dedicate myself to it before the drive is lost.  Mikey goes out of town this weekend, so hopefully I will have it done by Sunday.  Which already breaks my prior promise to myself to have it done by March.   Come on friends, you are supposed to be pushing me here.  Props to Brian for all his help.  the rest of you suck.

      I have shamelessly found myself infatuated with mikey tomassi.  This is conflicted with my recent desire to be too cool.  Surely, people who are too cool don't find themselves longing to be near someone.  People who are too cool don't want to be held, kissed and embraced by another.  I am a loner.  I have always wanted to be alone.  Always making personal sacrifices so that I could be alone, and now something fights that.      The funny thing about Mikey Tomassi is he does not represent someone I see myself being with.  His youth doesn't bother me - in fact I find it complimentary.  Here I am, on the verge of mourning my wasted youth, and a 22 year old boy likes me - and it doesn't carry the shadyness of when I dated the 19 year old.  However, he is smaller in stature than I am, less inhibited in representing himself and so charming in his joy.  I have always wanted to be with someone large.  A big strapping man to make me feel timid and overcome.  However, in the morning, when I watch mikey sleep, and see my bigger hand over his, my larger arm encompassing his smaller frame, and notice his serene sleep, his comfort in my embrace, I get a sense of a calm and satisfaction.  Something in that half unconscious moment feels right, and I wonder if what I have always wanted was ever what I wanted at all.

      what is it about the desire to sleep that makes me forget all my morning goals and hit the snooze bottom for two whole hours.  Two whole hours!  that just can't be healthy.

      I've lost track of the days....  best laid plans.... I have accomplished very little.   Didn't even look at the story I promised to have done by tonight.  I don't know when I will be able to do it.

      I have lost track of the days...   what to do.  it is now 2:43 pm.  I am going to read, measure my bed, sign new lease, write and not work out.  this was a bad week for me for eating unhealthy and not going to the gym.  my stool is a testament to that.

      day two  I have so much to do this weekend....    "Adopting the Poem in a Kansas Song Soap Opera" has to be completed by Monday.  I have been working on it for years, and I already had promised myself it would be done before March.  What's the fucking date again? shit.  Monday.  It has to be done by Monday, and it's okay if that means Monday night going into Tuesday morning.

      day one.  Trying to motivate myself.  I signed for a new apartment yesturday.  It was kind of premature, but I really didn't know what I wanted to do.  I suppose I never really wanted to leave Chicago, just really felt that I should.  I was getting nervous as well.  What if I found something to keep me in the midwest, and then Had no where to live.  So, I went for it.  At the very least, it gives me something to decorate.  how fun is that.  But it's a year.  One more year.  I don't want to be doing the same thing, in the same place, for one more year.  It's funny though, because I think of Sean Keane.  I haven't seen him in over a year, I think.  Speak to him even less frequently.  However, he said in my friendster profile that I have a sense of adventure that he has always admired.  I felt that by being afraid to leave Chicago, I wasn't living up to his preception of me.  Which is probably true, but it bothered me a bit.  Funny the things you think of.  And then there was last night at around 1:34am.  I asked the question that I have always been asking as of recent, to no one really, just out loud to anyone who will listen.  I said, I'm going to be 27, I'm educated, I've loved and lost, one of my best friends is dead, my dog died,  I take care of myself, and I have evolved.  I've grown.  I allow the people who have hurt me to stay in my life just to be better, I've even allowed a relationship to end, one that benefitted me greatly, a beautiful relationship with a beautiful person, just because I knew it wasn't fair for the other.  Fuck and shit, I've put my time in. When, fuck, when, is it going to be my turn?  and then there was the young mr. mike tomassi, who said that maybe he was my reward for all that time.  sweet little mike tomassi.  maybe we'll keep him for a while.

      Friends, five-one is upon us.  Cinco de Mayo, Mother's day on the ninth, my Dad's birthday on the thirteenth, Armed Forces Day on the fithteenth, Canadian Victoria Day on the twenty-fourth and the third year anniversary of my college graduation are all calendar marked events celebrated on this, the fifth month of the year.  Dividing five into twelve yields forty-one hundredths with a repeating two-thirds.  Nearly forty-two percent of the year has passed and looking back at those one-slash-one resolutions, I am admittedly starting to get nine-tenths weary.  Mikey Tomassi said to me, haphazardly while flipping through a Star magazine at the supermarket today, how cool he thought it was that I grew up in New York and now live [in Chicago].  He actually said "here," then added, "I've only ever lived here.  It's cool that you've made that move."  And I found myself wondering, where did that cool person -- the young guy with a sense of adventure, want of change and new experience, willing to go the great lengths in a one-way oversized rental van -- go?    Didn't the possibility of moving across the country again just pose itself to me?  My employers offered me a serving job in California and friends offered to put me up.  Another set of friends offered to rent me a room.  Both my sister and my parents offered to let me stay with them in New York, and as head bar trainer I could have easily transferred to the Times Square location.  My high school pals have been pleading for me to come back for years.  Why not?  Three years out of school and success, fame and fortune hasn't been beating down the door of my one bedroom efficiency across the street from the section eight housing.  My lease was ending.  Why not try a new environment and a new lifestyle out on the west coast?  Or why not go back to family and old friends in the east and redefine what once was so familiar?  There was, excuse the adage, nothing to lose.  I did not take these opportunities.  Instead, I resigned my commission as bar trainer and rented a more expensive apartment.    Almost six years ago in my early twenties, desperate soul searching propelled me into this unknown urban metropolis.  What followed are the most rewarding and memorable moments of my life to date.  However, though the impact may be lifelong, the glory of those times are fading fast into the vague cerebral mist of three years past.  The world outside of university has taken a lot of my close friends who defined that era away from me, and the needs and wants of the daily grind don't even give me the time to mourn their loss.  With nothing but a handful of two dimensional boxed up photographs and an occasional e-mail to keep them somewhat near, those moments of youthful growth and discovery sadly just don't carry weight anymore.   Now present, six years have past, in my late twenties and still desperate albeit now for different reasons, the propeller is broken.  I'm not going anywhere.  And why?  What keeps me [in Chicago]?  It isn't true love, prospect or social life.  I am anchored [in Chicago] by my own fear.  How I can go somewhere else?  What  is  out there?  What if I don't amount to anything?  What if I can't have the things I want?  Sure, I'm not getting them here anytime soon, but at least I know what's here.  In Chicago.  I may not be able to make those rewarding memories again elsewhere.  And maybe those that intangible cerebral mist of three years ago carries some heavy weight after all.  Five-one is upon us friends, forty-two percent of the year will have passed and though I have made progress in achieving my 2004 goals, I can not say I have wholly achieved any one of them.  My new apartment will need unpacking, arrangement, furnishings, paint and ultimately time.  I will need reams of cash on the spot to obtain these things, so my job and unconventional work schedule won't press on me so much anymore.  I got a new boyfriend, young and cute and infatuated with me, so issues of body image and social stress don't impose on me anymore.  Instead of confronting my fears of personal failure, I've discovered that I've just distracted myself from them.  Damn psychology.  Now I have more to do because that stops now.  I make the stand in saying that by the observation of memorial day, on May thirty-first, at least one of those three goals of 2004 must be completed.  Thirty-three percent accomplished with fifty-eight percent of the year left seems fairly decent to me.  Those years of early twenties discovery are gone forever.  And though maybe now I am too old to become a fashion model, I'm still too young to give up and die.    I will succeed.

        Side Notes and Side Bars    When Brian suggested that I start a blog, I really didn't think much of it.  Especially when I heard his daunting online plans.  I thought, I could never come close to something like that.  I lack the knowledge, and frankly, the want.  However my intentions to use it as a form of motivation in being more productive in the areas I wish to succeed in, along with our instant messaging and blog commenting collaborations, it has slowly started to realize itself.  For example, my promise to Brian to have more of my story available for him to comment on by today, forced me to sit and work on it, even more importantly, get into a creative mind, even though I didn't want to.  Plus all the positive feedback I have been getting from my blog is making me want to produce more.  I apparently have a much larger audience than I thought.  However, I am sure this entry will be a slight disappointment to those who have enjoyed my more literary or verse past entries.     The downside:  I am missing lots of gym/work out time. However, I have also been eagerly packing for the move.  So I have been multitasking all this week.  If I could somehow incorporate all four of these factors, gym, writing, packing for move and going to the work, I would be golden.  I am sure my having to stay up till 3am to watch Star Trek Voyager, and subsequently sleeping till 11 am isn't helping my time issues, but we all have to make sacrifices.  And speaking of the move, I have decided on my new apartment's decor set up.  Here goes:   Living Room: Traditional and Chic. Bedroom:  Traditional Kitchen:  Asian Inspired Office/Guest Room (it may only be an office, have not decided yet): contemporary and modern Bathroom:  Batman themed.  Juvenile, I know, but way fun.

        Uma Might Have to Go Too    Today, while rummaging under my bed for boxes, I came across Rufort's bed, his travel bag and food dish.  Why had I kept these things?  All of his toys had been placed in a memoir box of sorts and his food and medicines were tossed once they were no longer needed.  The only thing of his I did keep for a while was a bottle of doggie shampoo.  For five months after he passed, it sat on the rim of the bathtub not for any sentimental value or any other special reason but just because it always sat there.  That was its place, with no particular value in it at all, inconsequential in time or reason, a bottle of hypoallergenic mint smelling dog shampoo just sat on the rim of the bathtub.  That's all there was to it.  I didn't even notice it half the time.  But why his bed?  He didn't even use it all that much, preferring to sleep, slobber, scratch and piss on all the things I held more valuable, like my chenille tapestry down chairs or a velvet throw.      God, I miss him so much.  However it got me to thinking about other things I don't really notice that are becoming more apparent with my upcoming move.  For instance, A poster of Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy seductively gazing into the camera with her bright green glittered made up eyes and a caption reading, "Kiss me and I'll tell you."  It's very sexy, but I have not "really" seen it hanging on the wall in the closet, or given it any thought for the last 2+ years.  And when the notion of getting rid of it quickly crossed my mind, I had an odd feeling (which ties into my last entry that asked why I don't find comfort in certain things anymore).  It wasn't nostalgia, sentiment, or any other fondness for things past.  It was resentment.  As much as the image fascinated me, I resented it all the more.   There's a small mirror I bought from Walmart almost 7 years ago while I was in Pennsylvania.  Just as inconsequential as some other things I have previously mentioned, but I packed it today with every intention of making use of it, somehow, in the new place.  However, there is a small collection of other stuff, like Uma, that I have this very strong, and rather bitter, desire to be rid of.  And it hit me.  It's not the things, it's what, or who in a sense, they represent.    I remember trimming Uma down to fit into that cheap poster frame I got from Linens-n-things.  I hung her on the living room wall above my first sofa.  From there, she saw me sweating profusely sitting on the floor of my studio apartment, as I attempted to assemble that huge ugly birch veneer entertainment center from Target.  I liked it because it had casters.  What she must have thought when I tried to move it, put it in a different place to give myself a new set up only to realize, I was in a studio apartment.  Everything would only fit where it was originally which is probably why it was there to begin with.  I had no sense of decor.  Nothing ever matched.  Things were always in flux and she saw that.  She saw me trying to make sense of everything, find what I really like amongst all the other things I thought I did while looking for the cohesion.  Looking for me.    She watched as I went blissfully blind, skipping along to john's unhappiness.  She watched me as I welcomed people like Eric, Mike and K into my house, grinning shamelessly with her red glossy lips by my unwarranted fascination with them, and then later watched as they all took terrible advantage of me. She didn't just know me when I was younger and unaware.  She's seen me naive, led astray by the obvious, uncoated, ignorant and open to everything and then -- heartbroken.  And she knew.  Uma always knew.  You can tell by the look in her eye and her devilish grin.  She knew how juvenile and stupid I was being. She knew everything and despite my bold placement of her in my living space, the painstaking time I spent fitting her just right and all the other times I windexed her face, she remained deviously quiet.  After everything I did for her, that fucking bitch never said a G-D word!  She also watched as I fell on my face, cried alone on my bed, or stayed up all night waiting for someone to call who never did.  And I think she liked it too.  That's what I think of when I see that poster, and those two silver mesh candle pillars.  That's what I sleep with when I get into that bed, lie down on that mattress and pull that black striped duvet cover up to my face.  I am reminded of a person I never want to be again, and I want to be rid of it all.    So the question remains:  Does Uma stay, so I can show her how much bigger and better I've become?  Or do I say fuck the bitch, toss her to the curb and let her take her memories of past me with her?

        A Day Under Budget and Maybe I'm Going Minimalist...    I allotted just a little over $400 to spend today at Ikrapea.  However, I left spending only $272.35.  A marked improvement on past Shaumburg trips of past.  I got some decent things that I really look forward to refinishing and defining for my new home.  However, I have realized today that in buying very little, I already have way too much shit.  I don't want or have use for half of the stuff I have anymore.   Where will all the Batman nostalgia go?  It was cute six years ago and it's definitely still sentimental, but I'll be damned (again) to think that it will go in any of the main living areas.  I live by myself and plan to for quite some time to follow.  What do I really need 13 coffee mugs, 6 standard bed pillows, 24 candles/candle holders with a few hiding in a drawer somewhere for emergency use, 3 cocktail shakers and 11 vases  for?  Currently, I have 26 framed photos/collages on display.  Why?  Could I really have had that many memorable moments in need of eternal preservation?  There's a contemporary bookshelf hidden in the closet holding up 17 pairs of jeans and I hate it, but it matches the computer table hidden under a bright red table cloth -- which I am also not very fond of.  There are too many decorative nik-nacks too count; bear grass, snake grass, dried flowers and branches, an African insent holder, a wooden as well as a bronze display dish and leather trimmed boxes to name a few, but what to do with all of them?  I'm thinking, shocking as the thought may be: throw them out.      These things have no place in my life anymore and I can't really say why.  They have comforted me for a few good years.  What is it about this move?  Do I no longer need comfort in things?  Can I really say that I make my own?  In all actuality, it's just to another rental.  Still temporary in that sense.  Is this desire for better living space synonymous for simply better living.  Is a new apartment drive for new life?  Like some sort of wanting of a clean slate or a new set of crushed velvet curtains?

        Jason P Freeman Home and Media International    That will be the name of my home decor and accessories enterprise.  Now with our Lady of Martha facing prison time, and the subsequent decline of her self made cash cow conglomerate (That's what you get for building a business solely dependent on your own image -- Should have diversified bitch!)  the way has been paved for a new amateur face with no practical experience in the field whatsoever plastered onto decorating magazine covers everywhere!  Namely me.  Why not?  It's the American way, and I'm tired of my minimum wage cheesy restaurant bartending endeavor.  I think my primary focus will be design styles suited for other minimum wage nobodies like myself.  This inspiration comes from my upcoming move from an overpriced efficiency to a slightly larger overpriced one bedroom set deeper in the heart of the Broadway/Melrose Street Gayborhood.  I wasn't all gun-ho for the move at first really.  It was motivated by a spontaneous need for change, the end of my lease and the loss of my Rufie-Toofie dog.  I am really comfortable in this current dump which was my baby dog's and my home for a couple of good years.  I am mostly satisfied with how I developed it too.  But why pay the significant increase in (pet)rent with no dog to justify it?  I have no intentions of getting another dog.  So, I am leaving it for a new dump with an eat in kitchen, a bedroom closet and a lovely view of a brick wall.  Such regal amenities I have never known the joy of having in previous places of residence.  Now for the fun part!  Decorating!  Paint, of course.  I have chosen some neutral tones, mainly browns, beiges and tans.  Nothing too crazy. No faux finishing this time, but the colors are bold enough to make a statement, albeit a muted one.  Then the even more fun part, and it makes me all jittery just to think about it!   FURNITURE!!  (Mikey Tomassi couldn't even understand me as I recently discussed new furnishing potential with him.  I was so excited, he said I spoke too fast and too loud to comprehend)  Of course, I've gone through all the high end catalogues and visited all the local shops.  I put together all the new things I want and then tallied them up in price.  That's when I hit my first snag.  I won't bore you with the list of full walnut horizontal office armoires ($3500) or the English tuft leather smoking chairs ($5300) but the bottom line in cost was somewhere in the 12K range.  Remember what I said earlier? Minimum wage nobody.  No money.  I needed new options.  The compromise, dare I say it, Ikea.  Anyone who knows me well enough knows how I feel about Ikea.  To put it mildly I have dreamed that a meteor would fall on Shaumburg, leveling the blue and yellow trash can to just that -- but save the 8 pack wooden hangers for $2.  You can't beat that really.  That may sound harsh, but what else can right that wrong?  The board of trustees won't do it when they're making money.  The public won't stop supporting it.  It's very American to buy glossy marketed crap in surplus when the price is low enough.  And you can't blame the designers.  When faced with making mangled melted plastic look cool, I would probably color it a bright glance glaring, eye distracting neon green to divert any attention to its quality and craftmanship as well.  A meteor is really the only thing.  Having said that, I'm going tomorrow.  I don't have 12 thousand dollars.  I don't have 12 hundred dollars.  I barely have $12, and have justified the suburban trip and the upcoming purchases by reminding myself the the new apartment, as gloriously grown up as it may be, is still a rental and therefore temporary.  Why invest in finer things that may not accommodate a permanent space?  And Ikrapea, with it's Swedish screw systems and converted Metric is begrudingly affordable.  Besides, with a little imagination, lacquer thinner, a power sander, new hardware pulls, 3 cans of wood stain, a staple gun, foam padding, paint, a hammer and some nails, a few yards of fabric, and a flat head screwdriver all that cheap shit will be almost livable.  By modifying a chest and lingerie drawer, I will have new bedroom furniture at thousands less.  With adding padding and fabric to 3 $20 unfinished dining chairs,  I cut the cost to my new dining room set by almost $800.  All in all, I have gone from 12k on the new apartment down to about 3k, still holding onto the tuft leather English smoking chair but compromising on a cheaper one I found at Roy's for 1600.  That's fair, I think.  If a spoiled east coast furniture snob, who always spends way out of his means can cut that kind of cost, it can only be a stepping stone to founding a new enterprise contending to that of the fallen Martha's.  Or at least get me a spot on HGTV.    No?  Then how about the fab 6?  Come on already! I'm 27 and still mixing margaritas with a plastic shaker while wearing a hand written nametag.  I've put my time in and I deserve it.  No, seriously...

        Spring Gives Me the Chills    Corie's blog post today regarded the upcoming weather in New York.  I was all weather?  That girl is struggling for material!  Then I got to thinking about the weather and how I really should be making an effort to post everyday and here I am about to draw on her idea about the weather -- as trite as that is on it's own -- if that makes any sense.     I really like the winter.  In the winter I am a way cool bad ass mofo.  Head forward and high, adorned in a black leather jacket , or a mid length mod trench coat, sunglasses, and big black boots the impact I make on others and (mainly) myself is comparable to the wake of my way cool strut and the path of big boot tread marks in the snow I leave behind me.      Now it's Spring.  My boots are a little too Heavy for the warmer weather.  My thick black leather just isn't practical anymore.  To insist on wearing them anyway would make me just look, well, odd.  Like I was hanging onto something, desperately, trying to make things exist when they don't, or like an old man who wears plaid golfers pants out everyday because that was the look in the forties.  Whatever the analogy, it certainly wouldn't be conducive to that of a way cool bad ass mofo.  But what am I too?  The girls (meaning boys) of the gayborhood have already started busting out their daisy dukes and their skin tight white sleveless tees as if it were so sweltering the trees were melting.  And I have to admit, this whole new trend of gay dudes being really gym active and buff isn't something I have gotten into... yet.  I have a membership and all.   I go my fair amount and have the decently developed arms and shoulders to prove it.  But some of these dudes look like they had far better things to do then eat Chinese take out and watch TV all winter long.  It kills me.  I have spent so much time developing my sense of worth and fighting back negative body image and now a bunch of strangers with their good bodies and nice tans are going to ruin it for me just because it got warm out.  Seems unfair.    Because it can't have anything to do with a lack of discipline, determination and commitment on my part, I will just do what I always do.  Find the simplest solution and blame someone else.  Say something obscure and distracting from the main and true issue like all those rippling muscles glistening in the sun short shorts wearing queens are on steroids! Such degenerates are those muscley steroid taking queens! I am so ethically and morally opposed to them. And I'll boast it all loud and proud in a black t-shirt, jeans, impractical black boots, and some really overpriced thin rimmed Armani sunglasses, because I'm just that cool.

        My Life Fucking Blows    That will be the name of my memoirs.  However sure enough, taking into account the time it actually takes me to complete any writing project, someone will have already written "My Life Fucking Blows."  As well as the other two full length novels in the three part series, "My Life Fucking Blows Too," and "I don't Care if You Have a Terminal Debilitating Disease, my Hair Just won't do Anything and My Life Fucking Blows More."  I just spent a good 45 minutes writing this glorious blog entry.  So glorious I was contemplating rehashing it a bit and submitting it to local rags as a cute filler lifestyles piece.  And guess what happened?  Well, what happens to anyone who's life fucking blows?  While attempting to perform a spell check (thanks to Brian who so insisted I do that all the time) my computer "timed out" -- whatever the fuck that means -- and all was lost.    Great.

      Last night, I had the most disturbing dream.  Actually, I had lots of weird dreams but this one gets me the most.    I was at a new store opening and I had apparently returned from a night of debauchery when I noticed a co-worker still trying to set up a display.  It was 5:30 am.  She complained that she was so tired that she was starting to hallucinate.  I escorted her downstairs to where the rooms were kept and let her into her own.  It was then that I noticed another co-worker had returned so I waited at the bottom of the stairs making ghost noises so that I could scare him, but I felt myself falling asleep as well.  My eyes were closed, or rather perhaps the dream had ended.  Nothing was ahead of me and I remember not trying to see anything.  The blankness, the black canvas of my view didn't bother me.  It was normal, or at least accepted.  Then, very clearly, very distinctly, I heard in my ears and not my mind, (if that makes any sense):  "Jay!  You have to get up now!"  And I woke up.  It was 4:00 exactly.  Totally freaked me out.  All morning long I was waiting for bad news.  None came.    I also had a dream that I was good friends with Batman and we caught this girl who was trying to steal from him, and we had to drug her so that she wouldn't remember discovering his secret identity.

      I am working on a slightly different format for my story "Adopting the Poetry of a Kansas Song Soap Opera."  I guess it's kind of inspired by my blog talk with Corie yesturday on memory, and it came at a good time in my writing.    The Partial premise in the story is that the protagonist is recalling a few years worth of events in the span of a few minutes.  They are fragmented, coming by inspiration, or I should say like in memory, when one thing reminds him of the next not neccessarily in sequence or in any kind of order.   I have decided to lay these out in the story line, just as they are, fragmented, using lie breaks to distinguish the change -- kind of an obsolete, and now unconventional and frowned upon style, but maybe more appropriate and effective in this case.  Plus, it is a style used by favorite author, Mr. Ellis.  I like this idea too, because it is more showy, and less "telly" the third person narrator comes out of the story but still remains the story teller, so to speak.    My only concern is that the reader can follow the time changes.  we start at present, go past, go further past, then back to past again before returning to present at the end.  The concern doesn't concern me too much, I think, because I still have every intention to go through with it.

      ADDENDUM:  In my jealousy over Brian's new found admiration for Corie, I found myself defending my rights to admire her over him, on his blog no less.  (Is this how we are going to be left to communicate and address ourselves, with type written words transferred over fiberoptics?  Never to even remember who the other truly is in physical form, our eyes bloodshot from the computer screen's blinding blue toned pixel radiation?  ---> tangent!)  Anyway, my defense was that I have known her longer, then I added 15 years longer!  I realized I am at a point in my life where I can boldly claim knowing someone for 15 years, and that depressed me.  I lose.

      I had left the TV on Friday night.  Watching Peter Fallico turn produce crates into wall sconces on HGTV, though riveting as it was (cheap crap made into other crap forms with more than one use), I drifted off to sleep on the couch at around 10:15 pm.      The TV was still playing.  The living room and bedroom lights were left on.  At around 10:45, I was awakened by a shadow cast over my face.  I brushed the hair off my brow -- a few loose strands were caught in my eyes -- thinking how weird that just was.  For a brief moment, it almost felt as though someone were in the room with me.     Half conscious then, I could hear people in the alley below my living room windows. Nothing uncommon.  The bedroom curtains jingled a bit.  It sounded like a breeze.  Around 10:45 pm Friday night, someone scaled the two floors outside my apartment, opened up my living room window, saw me there, and moved onto the bedroom window.  They climbed over my bed, rummaged through a junk drawer, ripped my wallet off the metal chain it was attached to before opening up the bedroom door and entering my living room to take my cell phone.    They didn't get much.  And I should be grateful, as they were only inches away from irreplaceable valuables, like my grandfather's platinum and diamond ring. However, the experience has been unnerving, to say the least.  They entered my home well knowing I was there.  Lights on, TV going and it wasn't that late.   It stands to reason that I could be awoke at any time.  What were these burglars prepared to do had they been confronted?  It's no quick and easy escape out my bedroom window, over a bed, drawn curtains, and a dresser partly obscuring it.  Nonetheless, there is now another reality added to my new home that I have neglected and now needs serious consideration.  Unwanted visitors can get in.  People can see me.  This home is not secure.     I tell myself that this is city living.  It could have been so much worse.  I am fortunate to have lived in this town so long and never been seriously burglarized.  I was not hurt.  But how do I sleep in the dark now?  How do I defend myself?  How do I install my air conditioner without leaving the apartment vulnerable?  Needless to say the windows are locked now.  I intend to speak with my landlord about introducing new security measures to the building, because as it stands now, all the second floor tenants are exposed.  The back alley has over 8 access points outside of the locked front gate.  None of the lights were working.  Until then, I have come up with my own deterrent to give me some sense of piece of mind.     I realize this is weak, posted onto all of my windows, but I had to do something.  I wonder what this violation has made of me, offering violent threats to no one in particular, searching my house for possible weapons, a wooden rod, a hammer, and thinking to myself, "not good enough."

          When my former lover, Christian Bale, left me to make it big in Hollywood, he swore, with tears streaming down his sad flawless (with makeup) face to one day make it up to me.  Frankly, I didn't care much and didn't really believe him. I felt nothing could ever satisfy that pining and loss. However when he and my other ex Matt McConaughey got into their shirtless scuffle in Reign of Fire,     I felt Chrissy-Poo was sending out special homoerotic vibes just for me -- But I was wrong.  He had other plans, apparently, to pay me some homage and rejoice in our former fantastical union.  Christian is playing Batman/Bruce Wayne in the next  urlLink Batman Flick .       In what I hope any Batman enthusiast would agree is probably the best actor choice since Val Kilmer, who had the style but lacked the form, (Can't say that about my Christian)    there really isn't much more to be said.  The website is incomplete, but I understand it will be a more in depth origin story which is what we already got from the 1988 movie.  I have a feeling this is just going to be a hyped up gadget and special effect show to appease the comic fans who pay 100M plus to see films of this genre regarding how good or bad they are.  IE: HULK, which was awful, but still visually appealing.    Regardless, I will likely see the film when it comes out and buy the DVD just to see my Chrissy sex up the Bat    and for the mad cool new logo, remembering the times we shared, in my dreams at least, and forging some really hot new ones.

      I'm not as prolific as my blogging counterparts, Brian and Corie.  Or, I should say, blogging motivators, as they encouraged me, either directly or indirectly to do so.  That being the case, I am often at a lack of truly interesting things to address.  I try to make each entry somewhat appealing to at least retain interest.  However I also feel that if I don't keep making frequent entries, interest will dwindle as well.  So the question remains:  What to say, when I have nothing to say?     This is the chair I have purchased and will be picking up tomorrow.  It was a interesting purchase for me because it required, "thinking outside of the box" as it were.  I have had this Bombay co. Gift certificate since Christmas.  I had decided to use it to buy a new desk chair for my home office.  (That's right, I have a home office, don't be jealous)  I did some online research and decided on a very fancy looking desk chair, that seeing in person at the store, really didn't do it for me.  However this one caught my eye and only cost $50 more.  Though not intended as a desk chair per say, measuring two inches shorter in the seat than a typical chair for that purpose, I couldn´t´t help but really enjoy the look, feel and contrasting yet regal style of the side pillow that comes with it.  I think the extra stretch from the seat to the desk will be worth it for such a nice addition and look.    Yet more shopping has revealed new coveted wants for myself, and for the home office.  A roll top computer desk.     Granted, a little bit country, and not so much rock-n-roll, but I think with the right finish and my really awesome accessorizing taste, it will look really hot.  Then making my previously mentioned chair no longer applicable for it´s purpose as the desk chair space will be too small.    However, if this is my one and only pressing concern in the world, worrying how a chair will work for a desk I don´t even have, maybe I don´t got it as bad as I sometimes think I do.

      I heard that in a movie somewhere.  Always liked the phrase but never had an excuse to use it.    All the things that were exciting me in recent past are depressing me today.  It's just all so done, overplayed and used up.  Even my morning cafe latte seemed to express that.     But I still like it.    The work, relationship, apartment not done thing, I don't want to deal with it anymore, or at least not right now  It was all fun and exciting at first but as of recent, not so much.  I'm so bored with it. I went to a  urlLink boredom venting site  to rant about it a bit yet no one has posted for months.  I figure they got a sense of ennui with it as well, leaving it to fade into nothing but some template code and a bullet on a ten page google return.  People can't even commit to their boredom.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  I am feeling less and less like the Kid C, and more like a defeated Get_Yang.  And I am so over the G_Y.  He is just not cool.    Could I be sick?  Am I really bipolar?  I joke about it but perhaps there is a bit of validity there.  I talk about myself as though I were two different people.  (did you catch that G_Y vs. KC thing that just happened)    Mental illness does run in my family.  I just always figured I was spared because I always knew where I was, what my name is and what day of the week it was.  But I do frequently talk to myself and my moods go from light to dark in a matter of seconds.  There was also a time some years back when I couldn't remember how old I was.  No problem with that now, unfortunately.  However,  urlLink this pic  pretty much sums it up for me today.  BLAH!

      I thought once you hit the bottom you could only go up?  Or at least, that's what they say.    I am off of work today, this beautiful sunny Saturday, due to inclement weather.  When I tried to explain to the lovely widow B (the boss) that this would be the second day in a row, she did not falter, telling me there was nothing she could do.  The weather was bad.  Having just come from outside, I'd say she was wrong.  The silver lining in all those gray clouds made its way through.  I also can't help but feel that she is consistently rendering unfair punishment upon me.  I am fully aware of my fair share of black marks on my performance appraisal tally sheet.  I am one of the few people in the world who is not perfect.  Still though, After five years of loyal employment, I feel I have earned my place there, Bar Trainer or not, and this constant "down putting" as it were is uncalled for.  Yet, I accept the fact that I may be wrong, as I have been wrong on occasion before.  Perhaps I do deserve this inappreciative treatment.  However if I am not wrong, and her motives are unfair and/or unprofessional, I trust that fate will take its kharmatic course with the widow B, if it has not already.    And so another rung is forged in the downward spiral that is my life right now.    My search for new employment has not been very promising.  I have been hitting the pavement for years with no success. I have given up the notion of finding the "right" job to taking any job.  My thinking has shifted from doing what I want to do professionally to doing what I want to do in life.  I want to go to grad school.  I want to visit my grandmother more often.  I am now willing to do anything that allows me to do that, whether it be career centered or not.  Which leads me to think my decision to stay in Chicago was prematurely conceived.   The relationship that was all budding and fresh smelling when I first made this decision is now starting to wilt and reek of stale dead weeds.  The paint in my bedroom is ugly, I haven't been to the gym in three weeks, the homo downstairs won't stop singing or talking on his phone, my vase was stolen and the rent is due.    Looking on the bright side can be very challenging at times.

      When the large African American man entered my apartment to replace the circa 70's oven and fridge, he first noticed one of two of my chenille tapestry down filled King Henry chairs.   "I like that chair," he said, then scanned the room and the rest of the apartment adding, "This is a nice place... Real nice."   As I muttered a snide, "Thank you," out the side of my mouth, I immediately felt the influence of my mother and father's home, a place where difference in belief, gender, culture and skin color is not immediately welcomed.  My first thought was, what are you doing admiring my apartment?  You want to rob me?    The impulse was overcome when I reminded myself that, "No Jason, thinking that way is wrong."  Yet what I find so much more amusing is my second thought.  As I quickly pondered the notion of being burglarized by a nice man who openly shared his appreciation for my things, brain synapses firing a trillion a second, my first conscious solution to possible prevention wasn't getting a new dead bolt, an alarm system, or even the very responsible and highly recommended renter's insurance.  It was, "I need to get some Foo Dogs."     Foo-Dogs are valued for the protection they give when are placed near the front door. They are originally the guardians of religious sites, sculpted with the utmost ferocity to discourage demons and evil doers from entering, while warding away bad influences and spirits.  But if you ask me they kinda look like made up doggies in drag.  Which makes sense when you realize Fung Shui translated from the Chinese means "gay homosexual."  Is it narcissistic to be fascinated by one's own way of thinking?  I wonder how it is that I pride myself with logic and rationale, but think to protect myself with superstition.    Nonetheless, it has become a new obsession.  Which is good, because you can never have enough of those.  I have to get myself a set of foo dogs.  I am thinking for book ends, or a nice large centerpiece.

            Painting your bedroom at 3am blows.  Blog entries are so much more rewarding.        These last two weeks have been very challenging.  So many things to contend with.  I am finding that I just don't have the emotional strength to carry all my old baggage with the new.  So I've decided to dump it all and get me a matching set of Louis Vuitton.  First, the dumping:   To All Who Have Broke My Heart, Hurt my feelings or Made me Mad,  Hey guys, what's up?  Sorry to send you this in a cheezy blog entry, but there are a good handful of you that getting in touch with personally would be very difficult.  So I figured I'd just drop you all a note and let you know that I have given this a lot of thought and I really think that you all suck.  Seriously.   Remember the time I got kicked out of that gay kid club thingy for like a week?  Yeah, that wasn't fun.  I remember looking to so many of you for support and never getting it.  Now, I realize that I'm just me, and there were a lot of people involved up in that shindig, but I felt that I was always there for you.  I looked out for you.  I protected you.  I helped so many of you to be proud of who you are.  Do you think it was easy being the only gay face in front of the entire compliment of unsupportive university students and staff requesting equal treatment?  How many fights did I fight in your name?  How much dirt did I get in my face for it?  And Where were you when I needed you to fight for me?  Not there, and that's bullshit guys.  For real.  But that was a long time ago, I guess I should be kinda over it. Huh?  Now I know I have dealt with this same issue with you particularly over and over and over again.  It's crap and everyone is tired of me talking about it.  But when I think back to who really fucked me over, took advantage of me, made me feel cheap, used, worthless, inhuman and uncared for, you still kinda win.  We were both young, stupid, blah blah blah, whatever, I know.  Yet, I really feel I was a good friend to you and didn't deserve the treatment I received in return.  I hope you know that I truly wanted the best for you and did my best to help you get what you wanted out of life at great compromise to what I wanted from mine.  I was supportive of you, wasn't I?  I tried to be.  And I know it must have been difficult for you because I asked a lot of you, like cleaning up after yourself in my studio apartment that I let you stay in all summer rent free, not lie to me, not stand me up when I came to visit you and as base as it is, return the favor and suck my dick too.  I know, I'm a bastard for expecting all this of you, but ultimately I feel I was a true friend to you.  You were not.  And you've never really owned up to it.  You've never really apologized for it, and I know you never will.  Regardless of how much time has past or how much I just don't give a fuck anymore, that will always, well -- hurt, just a little.  You jerk.  John, I know it's terrible and wrong but I am so mad at you right now.  You borrowed my stew pot and never gave it back.  You borrowed my allen keys and never gave them back either!  I couldn't get my bed apart.  When I moved last week I had to bend and contort all the pieces because without those keys, I couldn't get them apart and it was a terrible disaster.  I have felt for years like I have done you wrong John.  I have had awful horrid guilt for letting you move to Virginia with that dude when I knew it wasn't right.  I knew it wasn't going to make you happy.  I let you go and I never said good bye and then you died, taking my allen keys with you and eventually totally screwing up my bed!    Rufie, I am not mad at you at all, but you broke my heart something fierce.  It's my fault too.  I know it is.  It's just that you would always get lethargic and I'd take you to the vet, spend $200 and they'd tell me you were fine.  I didn't want to spend the money again.  Why didn't you just tell me that time was different Rufie?  But you did though didn't you?  I don't think I was listening. I am so sorry.  I'd give up everything I have to get you back.  I really would.  I miss you so bad.   Speaking of not true friends, you, mofo, take the f-word cake.  Now I am know I am not always the easiest of people to get along with.  I'm crass.  I'm brazen.  I'm "outspoken" to say the least.  However, I can't help but feel I have always been there for you.  I was one of two people who showed up to help you move.  I brought you vapor rub and crackers when you were sick.  I answered the phone when you called me crying your face off at 5:30 in the am.  I've lent you my drill numerous times, for weeks at a time, that if I needed back I had to go and physically retrieve myself!  And where were you when I needed you?  Not there, and for what?  Some childish grudge that I have absolutely no idea where it came from!  Oh, and then you went and tattled on me at work and ran away.  That was cute.  I bet you get a sense of pleasure knowing that you have totally fucked up my work environment, and that I have been removed from the bar schedule because of it.  That is the kind of person you are.  Well, whatever, I'm okay with it.  I have to deal with the consequences of my actions.  I just take solace in knowing that I am, and always will be a better person than you, and that nobody likes you.  Speaking of work, Boss, you really let me down this time.  Five years and not one word.  My entire early and mid twenties of blood, sweat, tears and minimum wage and not so much as a pat on the back.  That's all I wanted.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  Yet, it is my own fault.  I have been there for a long time and you have never recognized the loyalty or dedication of any of your long time withstanding staff.  I was foolish to think I would be any different.  But I still don't think that's cool.      So I gotta let you guys go now.  You're bringing me down dudes.  Now I know I have said this before with  a lot of you but I really think I mean it this time.  For sure.  I feel I deserve better than what you offer.  Except for you Rufort.  Daddy will always love you. I will keep you close to my heart with fond memories, a tear and a smile.

      No Big news to report.  It's been well over a week since my last entry so I've probably lost all my fans.  However, my computer has been in a box this past week and I'm happy to report the new place is coming along nicely.    There was a little drama with my office however.  The gray primer was a mofo to apply and the paint color I originally chose was all wack.  I had to go out and spend another $30 on a new choice that, dare I say it, was from the Martha Stewart line.  But you should see it! It's absolutely gorgeous!  Most boxes are unpacked.  The bedroom still needs to be painted and assembled, as does the bathroom and kitchen.  However, I have also way decreased my new wants.  The leather smoking chair I have coveted for years, will not fit in the new space.  My original floor plans were flawed.  And I have also decided that I no longer want new office furniture.    So many things to do still.  Will keep updating...

      I have new cause and motivation to start revamping the book idea that has been storming in the back of my mind and collecting dust on my desk for the last handful of years.  There have been a number of tentative titles, however as of now I got two:  "Curse of the Chimera"  or  "Chimera's Curse"  Those of you paying attention might now recognize, that my personal rendition of the mythologicalChimera, as well as its English translation, takes form as a sub plot in this book, and is where my stern, black shirt, sunglasses wearing alter ego comes from.     Anywho, which do you prefer?

      I often feel that adages left by those anonymous are like mentally lucid pieces of displaced wisdom.  They make their way onto greeting cards.  They cross our lips when nothing original comes to mind.  Sometimes, they might even govern our major life decisions or crisises because we believe in them, though there is no logical reason as to why.  Anonymous has no history or lineage.  It has no school of study or research to back up its claims.  Anonymous is just that, anonymous -- unknown no one.  Nothing.  It has never done anything to afford itself the integrity and trust we bestow on it.  Nevertheless, these unclaimed anonymous passages are still valued and immortalized as our own distinctiveness -- not ingrained, but instilled, by omnicient forces beyond ourselves, because these words of truth have no true origin.  Yet they must have.  Surreal, how anonymous can take form and grant strong influence.  How the its essense, the spirit of no one, haunts. How no one is remembered, speaking to us inaudibly with its own powerful voice, making its collection of words mean something more than their base definitions alone.  Similarly, this feeling can be somwhat compared to a recent experiance where I recieved three consecutive enigmatic phone calls.    By myself in my last apartment, it was early evening and the phone rang.  Technology afforded me the choice to ignore it, as the number registered on the id screen was not one I knew.  The area code was unknown to me, and it was easy to write it off as a wrong number or even worse, a telemarketer.  I let the answering machine take the call.  The speaker played only static for a few moments, and then a man's voice came through.  I voice I did not recognize, distant, under the ambient background noise of his poor connection.  "Hello?" the man said.  Then again, "Hello?" "Hello?"  Easily contrived, just as I had believed:  a wrong number, so I thought.  He called again a few minutes later, and again with the static he called out, "Hello?" This time more frustrated, "Hello!"  "Hello!" It was easy for me to think, this guy just didn't know what was up until the third call when the disembodied voice started calling out my name.  "Hello!" he called out, this time sounding angry almost.  "Hello!"  Static...  "Jason?" he said, "Jason!"     Then he hung up.  Then nothing.  I did not know the number.  I did not know the voice, but it knew me.  It might be irrational to feel so, but the context and nature of the situation left me unnerved.  What could someone outside of my general knowledge want with me in such way they could not leave a conventional message?  Did they know I was home, and if so, how?  What possible intention could this disjointed, incorporeal voice have?  Sure, there had to be a logical explanation, but I could not think of one.  So I was only left to ponder the illogical.  What clandestine phrophecy did I just pass up?  What mystic message of fate did I just ignore?      The young Mr. Mikey Tomassi, the spawn of lawyers and doctors, no fan of Star Trek, or anything SciFi, did not share with me my mystique when I shared this story with him an hour or so later when he arrived.  He insisted that I call the foreign number on my caller id and discover the who, what, and where.  I could not, for reasons that I shamefully can not disclose.  So Mike did instead, thereby pulling me in from the outer limits, slammed the door on my twilight zone and killed my anonymitity.  My metaphysical intrigue equated to fantasy, my compelling experiance reduced to pure naivete, my outerwordly allure into unknown realms robbed of me, and reduced to nothing but some dude wanting to buy my coffee table.  I suppose that is why we beleive in, and need Anonymous.  Its untainted background makes it pure, therefore unwittingly honest.  Without bias, or prejudice it compels us foward, motivates and inspires with no reason to give us doubt.  So Thank you Mr. or Ms. Someone for your awe inspiring response to my rescent morbid post.       You have made me want to revisit my goals of this year, and try harder to be better, even if I feel I have already tried as hard as I can, because I know there is more fight in me.  Life, is indeed, what I make of it.  Though, I suppose one could argue that this is the life I have made for myself, and now I am stuck with it.  That would suck.

         I feel crappy today.    Nothing has changed.  It's almost July.  None of my yearly goals have been achieved.  I'm poor.  My job sucks the life out of me.  It seems that all that I do, and have done, to better myself and make my situation more ideal, is realizing itself as nothing more than a temporary distraction.   Nothing has changed.  It's bad.  It always has been bad.  I hate feeling this way.    Desperate.  Hopeless.  Without value.  Without future.

      There is only one week left to see this awesome show,  urlLink Love Pollution  produced by old acquaintances of mine.       They were invited to perform at the 2004 International Fringe Theatre Festival in New York and need funds to get there. So please, if you are free the few days left, it is definately worth seeing.  Thanks.

      The new apartment renovation plan has reached a snag in its development:  I've run out of ideas, money and patience.  With resentment I admit that the current set up in here is going to have stay this way for quite some time and that bothers me.  I have not reached the emotional state where I feel comfortable, satisfied and secure in my new space yet, and I don't know when that is going to happen.    Now, all one of you who may keep up with my postings, if there's nothing good on TV, may remember a time not too long ago when I listed a  urlLink furniture wish list  that tallied up monetary figures contending with that of the annual income of many high ranking executives.    As some had pointed out, I needed to make adjustments.  I am no executive, and I don't rank.  And I did make adjustments!  I swear!  I even started making my own stuff as opposed to buying it.  I wanted a European crest composite that priced around $500, but instead I made my own!  I wanted new bedroom furniture and I refinished cheap Ikrapea versions myself.  I reupholstered a chair, made matching pillows and painted my arse off, not just the walls, but aluminum picture frames, a wall sconce lamp and a whole mess of other poop.  But that's it.  There is nothing more to do, and the place is incomplete.    Adjustments made et al, I still need stuff.  I can do without a kitchen table if I get that computer desk I want.  And I can do without a new desk for a while if I get a coffee table of sorts.  However regardless, you can´t get anything decent furniture wise for $5, which is all I got to spare right now.   How does one find serenity in chaos? And for that matter, learn to love the things they hate, in this case, the wall color in the bedroom and kitchen?

      My Parents' long time friend,  urlLink Mrs. Maureen McCarthy,   succumbed to illness Friday June 11.  She was fifty-eight years old.  My memory of her is lighthearted.  She was a person passionate in her convictions, once returning a wine bottle opener to a secret Santa pool because her and her husband didn't drink (Good for her) but unimposing enough to never be disrespectful or disrespected.  Her perspective on life was quite unique, and I say this with a stronger notion than most would when things like this happen.  She carried a joy with her that was beyond description.  She was someone you want in your life, someone who made you feel good to be around.  I was always anxious and happy to greet her at my parents' many social gatherings.  She will be missed.  However, it can't be disavowed that Maureen's passing inevitably imposes another inescapable truth.  She is the first of my family's large circle to pass on.  In times to follow more will undoubtedly yield to her lead.  She not only leaves us with fond memories and motivations, but a powerful adage, so over said that perhaps it is even believed cliche -- So we don't put value in it, but we must --  Life is short.     It is so much easier to pine over missed opportunities, mistakes, poor choices and poor situations and we forget the good things are limited.   Let's not do that anymore.  For Maureen and for ourselves.

      His nose is too big for his face.  Eyes, soft little browns, intimately engaging, too big for  his nose. Lips,the lips are nice, top thin, bottom full. They feel good when pressed up against mine.  Lying on the floor next to me, shirtless, jeans rolled up to his kness.  Clean white socks cover his cute little  feet. I want to eat them.  He fans himself with his hand, tongue lapping the air outside his mouth, like a dog, panting, "It's hot,"  He says.  Outside myself, fingertips glide over his chest, then  his stomach: Smooth and tan.  Not skinny, nor muscular,  but slender, perfect.  Not one part of him I  do not enjoy.  "I think you are beautiful," I tell him. "Thank you," he says.  "I love you," I tell him, our mouths just inches apart. "I love you too," he says, then adds, "So much."  But I can only touch him for a short while before he complains. Can't rub his neck because it tickles, and I can  kiss him only two, maybe three times,  before he pulls away.     So I'll turn from him and Lie next to him.  Hands on my  chest, like a corpse, in the heat.  Only the ambient noise of the TV above us.  Maybe I'll sigh, or grunt, thinking to myself, in our silence, "Not enough," "Not anymore"  or even perhaps  "Never really at all."

      It's always darkest before the dawn, they say.  Which, I never really got because if the sun is about to rise, how is it the darkest?  Doesn't the rising sun bring light to the eastern horizon?  That don't make much sense, but anyway...     Not too much longer now.  Just got to hold out a little bit longer...

      My old flame Jasen Michael Woehrle (The Shmoobity Boobity) has been building his webpage for quite some time.  He has it broken up into a number of different parts, one of which, is his own personal commentary page on various stuff.   urlLink See for yourself.   His most recent of entries is one where he dips into his passion for psychology and divides the "break up" process into six stages -- which sound a whole lot like the stages of grief, but what the hell do I know?  I was an English major.  Reading this, I found interesting allusions to myself, as it were mentioned, the second of his two long term relationships as of date.       Oh Woerhle, where has the time gone?  I can't believe it's been a year already.  I can't believe I had that haircut or wore that shirt.  Not to defy your stages or anything, but I know we did our best.  You are the most compassionate, caring, supportive and generous person I know.  There will always be a little something between us, as there are just some things that time and circumstance can not erase.  Damning for some -- good for us.  God Speed Old Man.

      Friday night  Ms. Arthur, SBJ and I saw "The Rocketman," performed at The Viaduct by the  urlLink House Theatre      Ms. Arthur invited me along a few weeks ago and I accepted under the guise of spending time with my sexy and single young friend.  I knew nothing of the play and had no expectations.  The title gave me a notion that the show was going to have something to do with Elton John, or that Disney movie under a similar title.  I was wrong.  A love story inspired by the works of Ray Bradbury using 1950's camp ideology and the past's view of the future, "The Rocketman" was a loud, energetic and provocative story.  Original and dynamic, it contains a simple plot structure of love, family and social predjudices, yet stimulating and complex when considering all the elements that bring it together.  I felt the lead actor was extremely talented as well.  So moved by his performance that afterwards, wanting to tell him so I was  in such awe of him, star struck in a sense, that I shied away.  I really enjoyed it.  It was one of the best independent theater shows I have seen to date.  For the benefits of Ms. Arthur's 7th graders, the cast and production crew held a Q&A session after the show.  And I was moved, motivated and inspired again.  The playwright seems younger than I am.  The cast and crew around the same age.  In fact, I don't know if anyone of this theater company was older than thirty.  I wanted to be a part of it.  Granted I am no theater guy, it's not the life for me, but the creative process, the art of making, having it brought to life and appreciated by others outside of your own world, seemed less far fetched to me than it sometimes does.  If these kids could do it, so could I.  Or so I thought.

      As we get older we learn that love, indeed, does not conquer all.  There are just some things, some incorporeal things, that take stronger roles and carry heavier influences than the pinning of the heart.  Hurt though it may.       Oh Mikey Tomassi, you fascinate me so.  I find your youth and energy compelling.  Your innocence, though I know you feel you don't have it, endearing, and your wants of caress touch in a way I thought I had lost forever.  I would share everything with you, and you know that.    However, I am experienced, wise, jaded and bitter enough to know that if it won't work -- it won't work.  No sense in prolonging the inevitable.  The impact of that realization doesn't effect me at all.   If you weren't so cute this would be so much easier.  Frankly friend, if you don't want this, that's fine.  There are teams of others that do.  But please, if that be the case, stop fucking with me dude.

      I have somehow got my mother's archaic Suffolk Community College Throwback PC online using donated parts and free shareware CD's.&nbsp; Quite a technological feat for someone of my limited compu-background and capability.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This computer of hers is quite fascinating to me.&nbsp; I imagine it can't be all that old, it did have aol&nbsp;3.0 ingrained on it's system,&nbsp;however the graphics are awful.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to recognize a jpeg file at all, or anything digital.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; I wonder if that can be fixed by replacing the monitor or if the mother board just does not recognize such intriquite digital displays.&nbsp; (which by today's standards would not be&nbsp;too intricate I gather)  &nbsp;  On a more personal note, I don't know how I feel.&nbsp; As I type this I have a sense of strain within my chest.&nbsp; it doesn't seem right to be doing this for some reason.&nbsp; I have been trying to keep myself busy by cleaning up the house and yard and secretly taking care of my father's affects without my mother's knowledge.&nbsp; (Not easy since she's out of work for medical reasons)&nbsp; This is a four bedroom&nbsp;three story house, which has been neglected for almost 10 years, and overstuffed by my mom's discount crap shopping habit.&nbsp; Cleaning&nbsp;the linen closet required the rental of a 15 ton&nbsp;tractor crane -- No, I'm serious.&nbsp; I started yesterday.&nbsp; I'm still not done.  &nbsp;  Regardless, I can not&nbsp;discard this&nbsp;horrific&nbsp;realization that keeps haunting me:&nbsp; Without Dad, there is no&nbsp;home anymore.&nbsp; And it keeps reasserting itself as my world's&nbsp;in NY and Chicago seem to be turning to crap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh well, whatever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On a lighter note, I have added to new mofos to my link list.&nbsp; Fairy Carrie and Rob.&nbsp; Check&nbsp;'em out.&nbsp; Gosh knows I have.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Though my more recent ponderings on personal down settlement are beginning to weigh toward the opposite (see His and His Towels), my previous position on said subject has always been a firm and stout, "No thank you."  I may have developed a great deal in the last handful of years, but my interpersonal skills are at times still quite unrefined.  I get jealous.  I get disappointed.  I get selfish and angry.  Don't let my hard exterior fool you.  It's really more a defense mechanism than anything else.  I fully understand the concepts of compromise, consideration and self sacrifice, but the execution is where I begin to falter.    Nonetheless, even if I did so choose to bond as one with a life partner, my mate and I would be faced, not only with a bushel of social and religious opposition, but legal statutes just wouldn't allow it.  And I can't help but think that well -- sucks.  Perhaps I am just naive, but I can't find any logistical basis for these biases outside of religious foundations.  Take into account the ban on LGBT people in the military.  The proponent argument is that allowing such people into service would "Undermine military readiness."  However a recent study by the  urlLink University of California   shows that it isn't just corporals who are subject to don't ask, don't tell.  High level military officials, in the hundreds,  have also been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation.  These people rank in the areas of nuclear, rocket and missile and chemical and biological warfare specialties. Wouldn't removing these high level engineers also undermine military readiness as well?  Sure does, but the response:  Doesn't matter.  They shouldn't have been there in the first place.    Even the highly popular General Collin Powell has publicly echoed the no gay sentiments for reasons that lack any scientific basis at all. And it's not from lack of trying to find one.  I looked, a lot, and could not find one psychological or sociological study that excluded a religious position to support this.  Rather, instead of reason, I have found the repeating notion that LGBT people in the military make the straights feel awkward in living quarters, mainly in the shower, with the added smart sounding tag, "Which creates an uncomfortable living environment, thereby (here it is again) undermining military readiness."  As base as it is, it almost makes sense.  Naked people are vulnerable, and being eye candy for an equally naked "gay," wet and glossy next to you might very well be uncomfortable.  But again, there is no study to support this theory.  I am not saying this can't happen. I am just saying that it does not seem anyone has ever come forward to prove that it does.  You would think something believed in so strongly and used to exclude a sect of tax paying persons from a governmental program would warrant just the smallest bit of study.    As an avid gym goer, I frequent many a locker room, and I can honestly say my eye has wondered from time to time to the bare flesh of others.  Yet I can also say, with just as much conviction, that it is mostly under the guise of admiration and jealousy of their tailored physiques.  Frankly, I am too concerned with hiding my own physical inadequacies, or even as being percieved as learing at others, to be preoccupied with the notion of anything sexual.  And this is at a mostly gay gym.     Yet, what the hell do I know?  I don't speak from experiencee.  I know nothing of the interiors of military life.  If someone does, I strongly urge you to come forward and comment.  Send me an email, I will post it.  However, I am prone to believe this shower thing is just one aspect of the military environment and not worthy of discrimination on the whole.  If it is that bothersome, maybe it is time for a small change in the shower arrangements.  How about personal stalls?  I would submit that a bunch of dirty young men and women wiping themselves down en mass in a shower hole with soap given to them by authority figures is homoerotic in of itself, and only assists in keeping the G factor omnipresent in despite of the efforts to keep it out.    Base?  Crude even?  Maybe, but I feel it holds just as much unsupported stamina as the arguments in favor of the military ban.  Now don´t call me unpatriotic.  I want my democracy and freedoms (though restricted as they may be) protected just as much as the next guy.  If LGBT people in the military undermines readiness, then by all means, keep ´em the heck out.  However I feel this issue is so important we need to take it to higher, stricter levels.  I think there should also be a ban on people with low GPA´s in the military as well.  As opposed to the latter, there have been many studies linking low grades to behavioral problems.   urlLink Here is but one of them.   It is not uncommon for those with low grades to be violent, unresponsive to authority and team exercises with low attention spans and intolerance to anything outside of themselves.  Some may even have mental disabilities.  I would gather that being forced to relate to such a difficult person in close quarters makes for a very awkward living environment, thereby undermining military readiness.  For the good of the nation, we need to instill standardized testing and ban all those who don´t make the grade regardless of the damper this may put on the military demographic.              Look for ¨His and His Towels III¨ coming soon...

      Last night,  urlLink Troy Michael Petty  and I decided to hit the town running with drinks at the famous Whiskey Bar and Grill in Chicago's Gold Coast, which mind you, is only a few shorts blocks away from the even more famous Rush and Division strip.  In my close to six years here in the Windy city, this was my second visit to this bar laden arena for tourists, suburbanites and Lincoln Park Lolitas.    Observation:  Stereotypes, they are a changing.   In my baseball cap and t-shirt, I felt horribly underdressed, surrounded by all the fresh men in their shiny leather shoes, trendy clean hair cuts and snazzy striped button downs.       One of which was Troy's younger brother Lance, who I just find fascinating.  I was also jealous oh his beautiful manicure and neatly waxed eyebrows -- though I feel they could be shaped a little bit better.    With all these straight men looking so pretty, it may just be time for a lifestyle change.

      Kid Chimera is a self affirmed, incredibly proud bachelor -- always has been.  Sure, I've dated a fair share, had a few significant others here and there, assimilating into the role whenever necessary.  Why not?  But ultimately, I have always felt like a loner, always acted solo and doing whatever I want and whenever I want for whatever flippant reason I may have.  I like it.  I prefer it.  Fuck a Boyfriend! Everything I have accomplished in life, I did on my own. I don't want to share my shit with no one.  That being said, I am having thoughts of settling down.  Frightful though it may be.  My stake in being a swanky eclectic hipster is losing accrued interest due the poor market. Though the scene may not have changed much over the years, the people apparently have.  They seem to be getting much younger, (I blame Mike E. Hein for pointing this out during his most recent visit!) and they all sport Ambercrombie and Fitch.  Those bitches.  I don't get it. Where's the fun in overpriced casual wear?  I don't want to play with them anymore -- or maybe they don't want to play with me.  Maybe I'm just played out.  No matter, I refuse to wear anything A&F!  There, I said it.  Hold your gasps till later.       I shudder at the thought, but it may just be time to get a condo in Andersonville, a pair of brown dockers and a cat or two -- Oh yeah, and someone to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess that's an integral part of it as well.

       Militia Ethridge   When good ole' Mel dialed up the Kid C's cellular, about a month ago, asking what was hip and happening in Chi Town, I told her  urlLink the Taste  was coming up.  She insisted that she stop by for a visit.       I didn't take her all that seriously.  Mel is known to flake.  She promised to come out for my  urlLink 22nd(7th) birthday , but when she couldn't get a room at  urlLink the Drake , someone's fame mongering temperamental twenty-something girlfriend -- won't mention any names -- suddenly got "cramps" and they couldn't come.  However, to make it up, she assured me she was so down this time.  I told her I'd believe it when I see it.  But when you're Melissa Ethridge, you can't just go around the Taste of Chicago like you're Jo Shmo Nobody, using up your ticket vouchers for pirogues and beer.  Once the 3Million plus people saw her out with me, she'd get mobbed.  So the compromise was she'd do a free concert in my honor at the stadium in Grant park.  I of course accepted only on the grounds that she get city and corporate sponsorship.  Even if she did owe me one, Art costs, and she can't be giving it away for nothing. Besides, talent like hers needs to be spread out and shared with all her high class fan base sporting their Thursday mullets and chic open toed birkenstocks with crystal Budweiser flowing from the can, conveniently stored in their travel friendly vinyl beer totes.  Melissa promised to "want me, electrify and rock me" and maybe I might even get  urlLink Lucky.   Which I didn't! Because was too expensive at the Virgin Mega SuperStore.  Anyway, I was really impressed with her performance.  She has such a boisterous singing voice, and songs that have outlasted time.  She performed live for two hours straight, so to speak, and didn't falter once.  It kind of makes me wonder what the music industry has come to; like what sacrifices to true talent have been made acceptable for the sake of glitz, glitter and gold.  So few have talent like hers.  So few have the staying power that my girl Mel has.  Some of the more popular pop icons get tuckered out after 20 minutes of hard core lip synching.  Others are afraid of lightning and run off stage mid-show.  It's those who lack the drive, talent and charisma who get all the glory.  That's crap!  Not that Mel doesn't get her fair share of fame, but you can agree with that say, comparing her to Britney Spears would be less gainful, though not warranted.    At least Mel stays true to her gay calling though.  You won't see her gallivanting off to have some opposite sex sexual escapade with other high profile hotties, only to end up  urlLink engaged to some dancer , though still hot, of course.   Mel's a realist.  A true person.  Good for her.    If you're in LA this weekend, it's definitely a show worth catching.
