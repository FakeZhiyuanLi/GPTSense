      Yes, it is about to happen. In 48 minutes millions of savage warriors will embark on one of the greatest battle ever fought. This battle is one that will change the world forever, probably. But until these 48 mins are up all I can do is wait, keep racking the slide on my M9, and wander around the house looking for something to do to make this day a little better. This is JTVevox, signing off.

      I've been yearning to go back over the hill behind my house and scout for some good places for the 24 hour airsoft event this summer. So I pulled on my boots and headed up the hill. I got to the top and heard the distinct sound of deer bounding through the brush down in the draw infront of me. This nice forked buck climbs up and stops on the ridge opposite me. Nice wide and tall fork covered with velvet, and he stops and looks back at me. I wish I had a camera as it would make a sweet desktop, but I didn't so I just watched until he went down the other side and out of sight. So I moved on up the hill and got to the tall brush and narrow pathways cut through it. I once again heard rustling in the bushes but it didn't sound like a deer and I didn't see one jump out of the brush. My dad had just seen a coyote the other day which was the first time in 8 years we've seen one, and so I had an uneasy feeling about plunging into the tunnel of brush unarmed exspecting to find who knows what inside. I decided to return home and made my way back down.  When I got back I chatted with Thomas and Kara while simultaneously playing Battlefield 1942: Invasion of the Phillippines (yeah multi-tasker extraordinaire right here). After realizing that I couldn't go on with my life with my defeat at Mount Rimrock on my shoulders so I grabbed my pellet gun and a box of pellets and went back up the mountain. I knew that if I ran into something my gun wouldn't help much, but after all, this was a psychologial war I'm fighting and fear just can't stand up to a guy wearing tactical footwear and toting a rifle. On my way up I shot a hummingbird. Yeah some might think it's cruel and that it's just a cute little harmless bird but it's a bird nonetheless, and has the fowl hunter's creed goes, "It flies, it dies" so I figure I was just doing my duty. I went all the way back up to the tunnels and went through with no resistance save the mighty thick spider webs I braved along the way. I followed the dirt road up for about half an hour or something and looked for a good place to setup a camp for airsoft. I caught a glimpse of the old shack which was probably another 45 minutes away so I turned around and came back.

      You know, I was thinking, and I have no idea why someone would want to read these blogs of mine yet I love reading everyone else's blogs. Odd. Anyway I decided on getting the full metal Baretta M9 pistol along with a sweet leg holster. Turns out I forgot to make my payment to Redwolf for that metal body so they canceled my order. So instead of the body I got the gun, wanna fight about it?   No school tomorrow on account of a shooting rumor, isn't society grand? That means 2 3 day weekends in a row! Celebration time! Wooo Wooo!  Yeah

      I've realized that AFI - This Time Imperfect is a million times good, and if it were a member of the human race I would shake its hand. The Smallworld v3.0 is up and I scored a link from it, thanks GlenX.   There are no flowers, no not this time, There'll be no angels gracing the lines, Just these stark words, I find. I'd show a smile, but i'm too weak, I'd share with you could I only speak, Just how much this, hurts me.  nice piece...  Yea so today was pretty boring for the most part. Spent 3 hours installing a ceiling fan which sucked cause I couldn't get it to work until the 5th time taking it apart and rewiring it. I also got a sprayer and a hearty amount of death juice to begin my campaign against poison oak and its threat to the free world. Then I wound down the night talking international politics with Corie who had some interesting views on communism in Canada, and I never thought blockading Puerto Rico would be so easy. Finished up with reading Glen's new site which I look forward to reading later on in the days ahead and now I'm just rambling on and on and on aandnoand dianodnsdnooandandonassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

      May 16th, 2004 history was made at the Vevoda Compound. We had 12 people come play airsoft from 1:00 to 7:00. Best day of airsoft, ever. The turnout was even better than I thought it was going to be. We had the legendary Mick toting an SR-16 Knight with a silencer and TM M203, John Hansen with his SPAS 12 beast of a shotgun, a mess of M4s and Jason borrowing Cameron's M1A1 Thompson. We started off with a nice game of elimination set at 15 minutes which was a good warmup. Then we moved on to VIP which was pretty cool. Then later on we started playing center flag with a 1 minute respawn time. Oh boy! It got hardcore to the max. It's hard to explain in text, so you all miss out. We got some more airsoft supporters and hopefully regulars as we press on spreading the madness that is airsoft. I'm just now regaining regular use of my legs, I guess I should work out or something, nah. I can't wait till we play again in 2 weeks. Me and Thomas are going to order some BDUs and he's getting a sweet tactical vest, I can't friggin wait! Sometimes I just imagine in class that I have a TOP M249 machinegun and tear up the wall infront of me, that would rule.

      Looks like I've jumped on the broken kitchen appliance wagon and started a Blog. I mean, I need someway to be popular and accepted by the "in" croud so what better way then to copy everyone else!   I had a dream the other night, and it wasn't one of those dreams where you kinda remember but it's hazy and junk like that. This was frighteningly real.(I was unsure about the spelling of the word frighteningly so I looked it up on dictionary.com, I was right, yes! confidence boost!) On with the show. I'm in a large room like a gym, but there's a second story balcony and there's tons of people. Everyone I know from school and church are here. I know something is wrong though, somehow I know that there's people with guns pretty much holding us all hostage, but they're in a room attached to the gym so I can't see them. For some reason we're all crouded around looking curious like, "Hey this is interesting, what's goin on?" So we're all milling around and all of a sudden I'm holding an AK-47, sweet. I'm standing around then this big fat General from the foggy scene in The Last Samurai comes up to me all angry or something. I'm not sure what he was doing but I knew he was mad at me and I had to do something about it. I'm holding an AK which now has an enlarged bayonet on it which I have now flipped out. I'm a little freaked out now pretty much knowing what I'm going to have to do. I got this feeling like when you're playing paintball and you're right up close to an opponent. You know what you have to do but there's no way you wanna run out in the open and bunker him. You know you have to do it, it's you or him. So I went for it, I stabbed him with the bayonet, and I could actually feel it go in, then I notice it didn't stop him so I jab him again. I'm scared out of my pants now so I drop the gun and take off out the back door where Thomas, Tyler, Mike, Ashley, and the rest of the crew are getting on busses. I jump on one of the busses and we're driving down Harper Canyon Road and now I know I'm safe. And that's it. Woah.

      Ok, so summer vacation rolls around. Right off people stop blogging. Bradley's most recent blog stated, "Summer Vacation = Blogging Vacation." I would think that he would now have more time to blog now that he is out of school, whatever. Mike's House has been canceled. Thursday night Bible study, canceled until July or something which is a little more reasonable. I started working doing random jobs so I have a little less time to do stuff. It seems like I havn't done anything with anyone since vacation started. What the... there's obviously something wrong here. Sir Thomas Francis Ryan, Duke Bradley Duren, and I will hold a summit tomorrow to discuss these issues and pass a resolution.   In other news, I just realized how great Rise of Nations and The Ataris are awesome. I think we should play Rise of Nations at the LAN party, it really is genius. I'll bring that issue up at the summit tomorrow. Until then my fellow Americans, goodnight.

      I dunno, just felt the need to update.  Bonfire last night. I beat Tyler at that can can game and then got out 2nd the next round. It was pretty fun, something to do with fellow humans. Yeah so nothing really happened today, Austin and Danny came over and we did some stuff. I start painting my Nona's livingroom tomorrow as the first job my uncle has for me this summer. $10 an hour no taxes, can't beat that.

      I spent it sleeping. Ha! Yeah I overslept like, uh, an hour. So I did what a usually do when I accidentally sleep in. I think of all the reasons why I absolutely have to go to school (ie: tests, projects due, nuclear fusion, etc) and I came to the conclusion that if I did rush like crazy to get to school after missing 1st period, all I would do all day is sign yearbooks. Now I don't want to sound mean or anything, but I hate signing yearbooks. I did the whole Have a great summer! bs in middle school and sometimes I would just write my name which would get everyone all upset, heh. So now I've resorted to turning my brain off and writing furiously. Whatever happens happens and there's nothin you can do about it, you just slam the book shut and pass it. So I've only signed a few yearbooks and the highlights were stuff like, "No I will not father your children no matter how many times you ask," or "Have a lovely summer but make sure not to buy too many lawn mowers." I didn't get a yearbook cause even though my parents would be paying the insane $100 for one I'd feel like a jerk wasting their money like that. My dad said that I should have gotten one cause when I'm like a million years old I would want to look back at my yearbook, but it would probably just make me depressed and remind me of how old I am and how I'm gonna die soon. I know a guy who spent like $400 on a class ring. I'd rather just cut my finger off to remind me of highschool cause at least then I could put the $400 dollars to good use. Man highschool makes me mad. I'm glad I don't have to think about it for the next 3 months.

      That should get some interesting comments.   I fixed that MP5 I jacked up. Took me 1.5 hours to take apart but it's all good now. I'm toying with the idea of selling it, but I love that gun and I like having an extra to lend out so I can always invite people without guns, a recruiting tool if you will. Jared offered me $120 for it and concidering I paid $90 I'd only make $30 and loose a good asset. Yeah I think I'll keep it.  Recently I've been having this nasty streak of naps. I get home and decide to just lay on my bed for a little bit, and when you got music playing and you're all nice and comfortable the next think you know it's 2 hours later and you're all nappish. I got up and sat at my computer. I stared at me computer screen and had no idea what to do, I didn't even know what the heck to think. I just sat there for a good 30 mins trying to wake up.

      puppies started shooting out of my dog at 7:00 PM last night. Yes for the next 7 or so weeks we now have 10 dogs instead of 3. There are 4 boys and 3 girls not including the 8th puppy who died before being born, not sure if it was male or female.    Mike's House is tonight! Woo woo! Can't wait.

      Yeah I just noticed that Skyler always looks depressed and emo as frick. Sometimes I try to cheer her up by talking to her and stuff but it's no use. She only gets excited around food and when people walk up the front steps and she gets all angry. Next time you come over check out Skyler, the only emo dog you'll ever see.

      Yes, it's that time of year again. That critical point where school is about to end but it just can't come fast enough. Monday's airsoft feels like it was last month and the lack of anything to do in class, though nice since I can turn off my brain completely, has made the periods four times as long. So these are my choices. Wait. ARghh. Mean while my english teaher keeps coming up with these stupid annoying touchy feely writings we have to do like have a 20 line dialogue with an EVENT in your life. Geez, what a joke. Yeah so I've been going to bed at like 1AM pretty consistantly which in the past hasn't effected me much but now I'm fallin asleep all over the place. I was on the bus on my way home when all of a sudden I realized my eyes were closed. So I open them as far as I can which is about none then the driver decides to hit the brakes. I'm already all disoriented and almost end up on my face in the aisle. What a jerk I am. Yeah, but tomorrow is the last normal day of school and we have 4 minimum days after that. SAawweettt!

      Yea so today was pretty cool. I presented my powerpoint in Hist this morning and did pretty good, or at least a lot of other people sucked making me look good. Other than that all my classes are naptime. Ben bought the covert sniper and I think he's crazy for getting it but whatever, as long as we don't loose AEGs I'm fine with it. I managed to save his MP5 by buying it off him for $90 which is a sweet deal. Yeah so after I got the financial dealings reguarding Ben's MP5 squared away Kara came over and we hung out for an hour then she had to go to Gilroy or something to go shopping so I decided to do a little fix up work on Ben's MP5. I decided to clean the barrel by pushing a wad of tissue down the barrel then shooting it out. Well I screwed up and ended up spending the next 2 hours trying to get this tissue out of the barrel when I got a call from Kara. Aparently her friends bailed on the shopping idea so she came back out and we hung out until midnight, dang I wanted to get some friggin sleep, oh well, it was fun and worth the lack of sleep. And here I am at amost 1 AM still writing about it. I need sleep. Later

      Yeah, so my last name back in the Motherland is Vejoda. It's pronounced vev-oh-da instead of ve-vo-da like we say it here in the States. I like Vejoda better, it has a certain swoon to it that drives the ladies crazy.  "Greetings Mr. Vejoda, you're weapons grade uranium will be here shortly. We had an incident with the Bosnian rebels which caused a minor delay. *grins* Needless to say the rebels were crushed and the convoy swiftly on its way."  "Good, good, Mr. Gerasimov. *gunshot* Not good enough though *evil hearty laugh*"  Man, that rules. So yeah suposedly there's a Vejoda Hotel in Prague or something, and a street, so if you're ever in the Czech Republic I'll hook you up.
