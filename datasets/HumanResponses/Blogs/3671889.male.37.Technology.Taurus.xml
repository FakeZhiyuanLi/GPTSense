      It is weekends like this, that make Seattle a great place to be.  Spending alot of time out on my back deck (temps in the 80's).  Spent yesterday afternoon organizing the neighborhood water gun fight.  It seems that over the last few summers I have aquired a small arsenal of super soakers, and squirt guns, so am able to arm most all of the neighborhood kids.  Really have to get a digital camera in the budget so I can post pic's.  It was not all play yesterday, as I was doing some side work (home networking).  This is the part of the post that could actually be useful for someone reading it.  Although most everyone I know that would read this is a techie.  Here it is, the three simple things to do, to keep your computer and/or computers and home network running smooth.  1.  KEEP those Anti-virus definitions updated and current.  You can actually schedule it to do it without any user intervention.  We would also like to ask all virus writers to please not spoof the email address of the dumbass who opened the virus in the first place.  We would really like to know who this person is.  2.  Run those Microsoft Critical updates, or get a MAC.  3.  Spyware is slowing down alot of the computers that I work on.  Download and run Adaware, its free.  I personnally recommend SpySweeper it tends to be a little more proactive.  There it is my feeble attempt to help people and computer relations. As a last thought "what would chairs look like if your legs bent the other way"

      Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse, it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing, 800 DPI resolution, and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me, my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one, for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks.
