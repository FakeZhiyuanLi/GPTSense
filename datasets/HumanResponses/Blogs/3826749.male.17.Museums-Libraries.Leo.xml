       Don't you just love those times when it seems like you have no one to go to?    This day sucked.  Hardcore.  I've been in the shittiest mood ever, and whenever I'm in those moods are the times when I have no one to turn to.  I hate being alone, and this seems to be a reoccuring trend.  I've gone from someone who I consider emotionally secure to someone who cries at the turn of a dime.  I don't even know if that's a saying.   Guess who's crying now?   It seems that my best friend party is going to have to be postponed - most likely cancelled because I'm a boy, and Beth is hardly allowed to socialize with me outside of school.  And guess what - school's over.  What do her parents have against guys?  Honestly, Beth is 18, her parent's know I'm gay - maybe it's about  me , not the fact that I am a guy.   Do they not know that I am her best friend and that not seeing her has like, killed me?   God, I just want to break down and cry - oh wait.. too late.   I don't even know what to write about anymore... I just want someone to talk to.

       Intellect is hot - that just occurred to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It also seems to me that Blogspot has changed their format for posting in blogs.&nbsp; I can do all sorts of fun stuff. &nbsp;  font  &nbsp;  colour  &nbsp;  emphasis  &nbsp; Pretty snazzy, hey did I spell emphasis right? &nbsp; So Peterborough seems to have been washed a way in a flood - maybe it's in Texas now - I've always wanted to go to school in Texas! &nbsp; In my program today, we beat our library record (well for the 3 years I've been the summer coordinator).&nbsp; 9 kids all together!&nbsp; Talk about a bumper crop! &nbsp; Bumper crop makes me think of corn. &nbsp; Corn makes me think of food. &nbsp; I'm hungry. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Oh god... I am so damn tired.  I'm like on Tylenol 3 lag, combined with 4 hours of sleep, and those 4 hours being interrupted by uber amounts of thunder.  My T3's have been replaced by chocolate covered coffee beans, and I can have coffee again - thank god.    Well, it's like 8:20 in the morning, so I have like an hour to get ready, and get to work - joy.  I'm therefore not sure if I'm gonna make this a long post; knowing me I will.    Last night on the spur of the moment, Julia and I went up to North Bay to pick up some stuff for her swim class, instead of rushing around on Saturday to do it.  Now, on Saturday we can go mini putting, and see a movie or something.   So I have minimal plans to replace my necklace, and get maybe a bracelet, and I don't know what kind of mood I was in, but I ended up spending like $115 - I blame it on the T3 (r.i.p.)  So, I ended up getting a pair of sunglasses from Randy River, even though I boycotted that store because... I just did.  But hey, the price was right, $10.  So then I buy ANOTHER pair of sunglasses at AE because I fell in love with them, and they are now going to be glued to my face.  They were $24.99, with 30% off - you do the math.  While I was at AE, I also replaced the necklace which I lost, as well as buying two braclets.  All together I spent $67.54 at AE, for sunglasses, and 3 accessories - yikes.  However, I did get a GREAT bargain.  I've wanted to get one of those trucker style camo print hats for awhile now, and while Julia and I were in Dollarama geting like 30 toys, I found one - and it's fricken awesome!  1 Dollar!  Who would have known!  That saved me like, 15-20 bucks, so that's why I don't feel too too bad.  So then Julia and I get a milkshake at Laura Secord, but I remembered I couldn't drink it from the straw (wisdom tooth), so I hate to get a fricken dinky spoon, and had to wait until we got to the car.  Yesterday's like 35 degree humidity took good care of that milkshake.  I bought Julia's milkshake for her, since she was the one who was driving, and then we went to the Bulk Barn, where I bought $10 of various candy and chocolate covered chocolate beans.  I love spending money, haha.  So anyways, that was my night last night.  I only got to talk to a certain person online, but that's 2309% ok with me, because I still got to talk to that person, whom I am thinking about right now!  And guess who is now late for work?

       2 Tylenol 3s down, 28 to go.  That should last my until about, noon tomorrow!  I don't feel like talking about the pain in my mouth, but I will share a humourous story regarding how my wisdom tooth (yes tooth, I have another appointment, ugh), was extracted.  So, there I am reclined, frozen (after much holding of the breath and breaking out in a cold sweat) with my eyes shut so I don't see what the dentist is putting in my mouth.  I asked if they had a Discman, because I wanted to get my mind off the fact that they had some sort of device in my mouth, at which the sight of would probably make me vomit.  There was a mystery CD in the Discman, and I would have sooner have heard the grinding going on in my mouth.  "Pop from the 60's"  IIIIIII put a spell on you!  I didn't know whether to smile, or cry.  Afterwards, when the dentist asked me if I had any questions, I replied with one: "Do I still look hot?"  He replied yes.  And so ends the tale of the pullage of my wisdom tooth.  Werd.

       I'm tired.  Last night I was at Whitney's cottage, and we spent like an hour and a half making soap - oh god it was so funny.  She broke so many dishes, and was like "WHY!!?"  Anyways, it was a fun night, we talked about our fantasies in high school, and various verbal bric-a-brac of that sort.  It was nice!  We sat outside for like five minutes it was so dark.  It was like we were in a dark room, the only thing we could see was a slight difference where the sky started.  Once we heard noises in the bush, we booted it back to the cottage!  I love Whitney, I always have so much fun when I'm with her, even when we have nothing to do.    Yay for friends.    Speaking of that, I'm so happy I'm having my best friend party on the 31st!  It's gonna be hella fun.  Me, Beth, and Whitney, pools, facials, tents, bonfires, 15km bike rides - I can't wait!  I don't know what to write about, I'm bored, as per usual.  The day before I get my wisdom teeth, and everyone's working.  I think I'm gonna enjoy my last Doritos for awhile and go relax in the pool, it's a nice day!  Oh, and by the way - Sean, I'm thinking about you too, and don't ever call me muffin-face again, mmkplzthx!  Hehe, I'll stick with Brentney Spears!

       What a boring day.  I got up at 10:00am, went to work at the gym at noon.  Worked until 7pm, then worked at the library from 7pm-8:30; and now, I'm just sitting.  MY day was completely uneventful!  How boring!  Well, it was COMPLETELY uneventful...  The Twinzees, Corn (elia) and Fran came in to work out, and we all talked.  It was nice to see them again.  Who knew that I could pick them both up at the same time?  So I dusted the cardio room while they worked on on the machines.  Whitney also came in for a tan today, and I haven't seen her since monday.  We didn't talk very long, because she was just there for her tan.  Tomorrow after work we are gonna have one of our nights out.  Hmm, what are we gonna do?  I think we will bike to Sundridge, go out to dinner at the double decker, get ice cream, prowl for guys, come back, make soap, do facials, and buy 30$ worth of candy.  Either that or just go to her cottage, haha.  They both seem equally appealing to me.  Ouch, a mosquito bite my forehead.  Also, this guy came into the gym today.  I don't remember his name, I think it was Chad, and I'm pretty sure he was flirting with me.  He was good looking, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna pursue something with someone from the gym.  As well, quoted from my boss: "I don't want my employees fucking the clients!!"  Oh Rick, what would I do if I just worked for Gerry, and not you?  Oh well, like anything would happen anyways, although it would be exciting to have like a fling that I'm not supposed to be having.  I'm all talk though, not like I actually would.  Besides, someone makes me not want to prowl.  Oh well, it's fun to flirt anyways - gets me through the day.  I want tomorrow to come.    And I want some junior mints, and someone to say they love me... that would kick ass.

       I've had the strangest night ever.  It started out great...  Work was so long today.   Between the data entry, the filing of hundreds of cards (literally) and putting up with shithead kids, I just wanted to leave.  I consider myself a patient person, but damn, that sure was put to the test today.  Three words:  TIMOTHY FUCKING GATES  He's always in the library, do-ing noth-ing.  He's 14, does NOT bathe (he seriously smells like a washroom in a port-a-potty) and he's dumb.  I know you shouldn't say that about people, but when someone knows nothing, and they are as annoying as hell, you don't want to help them.  "Brett, how do you spell bonus?" "Bren, how do you spell skulls?" "Brad, how do you spell dragons?"  And he only does this to piss me off, seriously.  He asks me the same questions 3 times in a row, and finally I said, in my stern, calm, cool library voice: "Sound it out Tim, if you ask me for help once more, I'm not going to help you, and if you try to touch me, or give me another Charlie horse, I will ask you to leave, and you won't be coming back."  Finally, I just resorted to NOT reasoning with him, and telling him just to plain, "Shut-up, and figure it out yourself, I'm busy."    Yay for me.  Actually, this entry hasn't turned out to be about what I wanted it to be, and now I'm having butt spasms, not fun.  Anyways, I was so excited just to get off work, and my night was going great: awesome hair cut, got paid, was excited to talk to Sean... get home and Whitney left me a gift, and I open it;  and it was those two African style head sculptures that I had my eye on, and she bought them for me, along with some soap she made.  Those heads weren't cheap either.  I seriously wanted to wet my pants, that's when it all when downhill.  No, I didn't wet my pants.  Whitney went to her cottage, and I couldn't get ahold of her.  Mom was expecting a call, so I couldn't get online to meet up with Sean.  I have to work more hours at the gym tomorrow, and still work at the library, so I'm working until 8:30 at night.  I need to give my dad my check.  I miss Whitney, I miss Beth.  Right now, the only thing that bothers me out of that list is not talking to Sean.  I managed to force a smile through all say just at the thought of talking to him.  Just that one thought was what kept me from screaming "TAKE A FUCKING BATH!!!", and punching TIMMY in the face.  God knows myself and my boss wanted to.    I'm kinda glad that I have this blog.    I can't get ahold of Whitney, I don't know her cottage number.  I can't call Beth, she's away.  I can't call Sean, because I don't want to wake him.  So all I can do is write about the shittiness of it all.  Hey, at least it made me feel better.  Actually, I'm tired, which is good.  I think I'm gonna go grab my book and read for a bit.  And I want pie.

       My ass is killing me.    Last night, Whitney and I biked to Sundridge to watch the Canada Day fireworks, which were, this year on the 3rd for some reason.  So we get there, and find Michelle and her friend Trish, and Trish's bro and some other people.  The fireworks were actually like 10 minutes long.  Pretty good considering that there is probably no money in this area, haha.  After the fireworks, and the tourists buggered off because all of the locals were drunk and abusive...like REALLY abusive.  Whitney and I had to duck out in Jocelyn's front yard with her and her dad and older brother Will.  Their house is like right on the main street by the entrace to the beach, so there were alot of people around.  Well, after like 15 minutes of waiting we finally skiddattled on home around....12?  We biked home on the highway, and make a rest-stop at the school.  We got home around 2, because we were dinkin around town for about 1/2 hour.    All in all it was a good night, I started talking to Andy again...we talked online until like 4 am.  I don't know what to make of it, but I know that I've moved on.    In other news, my gums are killing me, I can't wait to get my wisdom teeth out next week.  You know that feeling that you get when the dentist scraps your front bottom teeth?  I have that like 24/7, and it's the most annoying feeling in the world.  Well, that's about it for me - time to blare RuPaul.

       Yay for a new blog filled with thoughts and ideas - my ideas!  I just got home from my bike ride to Kwik Way, and I got an e-mail from Sean blabbing about his blog, so I decided to make one as well - I'm such an individual.    Well, what should I talk about,  I didn't really have an eventful day.  I went to the library to tell my boss that I need 2 hours of overtime per week, and she agreed - thank god.  And then I went to the store and bought a white cream soda and a Bounty bar... *bliss*  And now I'm lying on my floor, drinking that cream soda and eating that chocolate bar!  What a strange concept!  I think I'm gonna read the Astrology book that Whitney gave me and just relax for a bit, because god knows my life is WAY to stressful, haha!
