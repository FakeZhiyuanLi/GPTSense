        I have come to enjoy my peace and quiet. I enjoy reading, whatever book I am involved in reading daily, as I take time to do things each day that I enjoy. I am lucky in my un-luckiness in that I am retired. Not by choice, but by disability, while active duty in the US Navy overseas. I also enjoy my Emails & chats online with friends. These things bring me closer to the world that I enjoy &amp; they remind me of the simple pleasures in life. I first learned of the simple pleasures in life while stationed in Naples, Italy. The Neapolitans showed me how to take the time to smell the flowers and how important it is to embrace the joy of seeing the grapes on the vine before they are picked and turned into the first wine of the new season. I now find myself embracing each moment for its own right and have found in myself a peace and reckoning I have never known. Joy, peace, calm, these words were never in my vocabulary...Just ask my ex-husbands! If there is anything I can pass to others it would be to find this peace and joy. I am now committed to the joy of life on a daily basis by seeking a little peace in a piece of each day!

        I had purchased a new AT&T wireless phone with base, having caller ID &amp; answering machine, just last year and yet the past few weeks I have had nothing but havoc trying to get a decent replacement battery and having it charge properly. Only to find the trouble was with the phone itself! To my chagrin, I pulled out the sales receipt, only to find that I was past the one year warranty by 25 days! Talk about a set up! I always found it nice to buy a product that has a full year warranty, but now I feel like they have us and we wind up purchasing their products much too often and thus disposing of the old product, better known as junk by then. If ever I missed recognizing that we live in a disposable society; I know better now! This time I got a larger named brand, as if AT&amp;T wasn't large enough, but they aren't in electrical products, and also, I got a model with all the bells and whistles I could want. I suppose this is to make up for having to get a new one in the first place! If it's only going to last a year it might as well be a GOOD year's use. I hate how disposable we have gotten. I always respected those who maintained their products like cars and household electronics. I felt I was one of those people. I hate landfills and thus recycle more than anyone else on my block. Where did it get me this time! Well...now I can at least answer the phone because the phone works...for now!

         I am a James Bond fan yet I have to say that, other than Casino Royal, the latest spoof off 007, Johnny English, is amazingly humorous. You can always expect slap stick folly with Rowan Atkinson. This is a cheaper spoof than the expensive 1967 Casino Royal, but worth it. Expectations of predictability were happily incorrect &amp; I found myself just riding the wave of Atkinson's antics. For those of you wanting good wholesome entertainment...This is it! It reads a 9.5 on my Happy Meter!

        Does it seem to you, as it does me, that Bush is riding the "Save the Floridians from the hurricane disaster," for everything he can? I fear the idiots will see this as heroic, on his part, rather than standard issue national disaster relief that would have happened anyway. Bush is taking this and running with it and that just shows how low he has gone! I hope when the debates begin that we can show true justice.
