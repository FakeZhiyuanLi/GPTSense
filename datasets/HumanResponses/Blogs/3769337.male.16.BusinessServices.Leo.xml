      I've been hitting the "snooze" button on my alarm clock since 9:00am. Work sucks, paychecks are good. Agh... gotta be at work in an hour and a half. I work at the fine establishment of Accu-Temp Heating and Air Conditioning. I answer phones. I make shipping lables. I stuff envelopes. I have to dress-up. But then again I never go into work earlier than noon and I never work weekends. And the pay is decent. Im too tired to come up with anything good to talk about. I'll write more later...

      My moms finding another cruise to book, WooHoo! Yeah pretty damn exciting, it's going to be fucking awesome cuz I can bring a friend. Hopefully were going on this seven day that goes to Montego Bay, Cozumel, and Grand Cayman. That one's on a huge ship called the Carnival Conquest. Yeah that was pretty much the highlight of my day... other than that it's been pretty dull. I think i'm gonna call laura later I miss her...

      Oh yes. Cruise ships are without a shadow of a doubt the greatest things on earth, second only to the girls on the ships of course. A word of advice to anyone that goes on one, TALK TO PEOPLE it makes it so much more fun to have someone to flirt with, trust me. As for the cruise I just got back from it was my fourth, seven days long, and it went to St. Thomas, St. Maarten, and San Juan. My Favorite island was St. Maarten, because it seemed like everywhere you went there was a very inviting and friendly atmosphere. St. Thomas was pretty cool, we went to a really nice beach (I guess it's rated like in the top 10 in the world) called Maegans Bay, and I bought a sweet Armani watch. San Juan on the other hand was my least favorite because it seemed a little shady (we saw Graffiti that said "muerte de Gringo" and "F*ck U.S.A.") not the warmest welcome imaginable. As for the ship, it was gorgeous. It was twelve floors high and had three pools. I went to the "Teen Disco" almost every night, it was ok but not as good as on my previous cruise because after 10:30 it was open to anyone. I met a really cool girl though, the first night I met her we spent all night on the top deck of the boat waiting for the sun to come up. I wasn't really excited about the idea at first but I turned out to be really good because I got to know her and found out how fun she is to hang out with. Every night after that we hung out in my room...
