						   Can you ever get over your first love?  Aha! This is a trick question. Sure, it's  possible ...but it will never happen. They won't let it.  In a world of cliches and universal truths, one that has consistently demonstrated itself as accurate is that ex's have a mystical sixth sense that alerts them just before the precise moment that they are to become obsolete in your life. No matter whether you met someone else, you've become occupied by work and hobbies, you've found an outlet like singing or writing, or enough time has passed that you've healed old wounds...whatever it is that has allowed you mind off of your ex...it cannot disrupt the omnipotence of your ex's spidey sense that tingles as soon as you're about to take another step forward emotionally.  Upon receiving this sensation, your ex will inevitably get in contact with you. It may be a random phone call on a rainy night, or a message on your voice mail when you get back from work, or an otherwise harmless looking e-mail, or an instant message accompanied by an all too-familiar icon. Whatever medium they use, the contact will (without fail) be short, sweet, and wholy dissatisfying. In fact, it will look/sound something like this:  Hey ___(a)___, The other day I was ___(b)___ , and it reminded me of that time we ____(c)____ . I couldn't help but ___(d)___ when I thought of it, so I thought I'd share it with you. I hope you're doing well. Give me a call if you want.  -___(e)____  btw...How's ___(f)___ ?  Now, fill in the blanks with the following options: A) -your first name -a nickname your ex gave you  B) -watching a movie -listening to our favorite song on the radio -telling a story  C) -made love all night watching movies -made love all night listening to music -made love in a public place  D) -laugh -cry -smile  E) -your ex's first name -a nickname you gave your ex  F) -work -your family -school  It will be short, because your ex does not want you to think that they are missing you so much that they put an inordinate amount of time or thought into it. A long and informative message would indicate that your ex has an awful lot to share with someone and that you are still such an important part of their life that it's necessary to share it with you. Admitting this sort of dependence is something an ex will never do...at least not until you have done so first.  It will be sweet because your ex wants to subconsciously trigger all the cute and cuddley memories that made your relationship momentarily worthwhile. Time and space away from someone has a way of widdling down your mental image of that person and your relationship together. If things ended amicably, then the remnants of your memories will predominantly be positive. If things ended bitterly, then the experiences salvaged by your memores will be predominatly negative. And if things ended ambiguously, then you'll have a balanced collection of good and bad memories. A sweet snipet of words from your ex will tip the balances toward the positive. Even if you were venomously brooding over your ex, a properly plucked heartstring can convince you to reconsider any resentful feelings you were previously harboring. Illiciting the, "Wow, I forgot how cute/funny/silly she could be. Maybe she's not a total bitch after all. I really miss her," response.  It will be unsatisfactory because it will not contain any of the information you really  want  to read. It won't confirm that you're better off without her. It won't tell you that her life is in shambles since you broke up. It won't tell you that she's be abstinent since she last laid with you. And if, heaven forbid, it contains evidence to the contrary, it won't confirm that you're much better in bed then her more recent lovers. It won't tell you that she's had a moment of clarity and enlightenment that revealed to her that she will never find someone as loving, supportive, funny, attractive, intelligent, and overall perfect as you. It won't tell you that she's come to the realization that in the pseudo-financial world of the dating stock market, her stock peaked when she was with you and it has been suffering a market crash ever since you broke up. It won't tell you that she still loves you. It won't let you forget.  (to be continued)

						   A diary&nbsp;is a fascinating thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any piece of writing,&nbsp;diaries (note: for the purposes of this post, I will use&nbsp;diary, blog, and journal as synonyms)&nbsp;offer the reader a glimpse of what is going&nbsp;on&nbsp;within the mind of the writer.&nbsp; What makes a diary more interesting than, say, a novel or academic paper is that a diary, by it's very nature,&nbsp;contains the writer's innermost thoughts and commentaries on his/herself.&nbsp; &nbsp;It captures, as best words can (or rather, as best the writer's own mastery of words can), the essence of what makes one tick.&nbsp; A diary is the closest thing we have to answering the age old question of "What the hell was I thinking when I did/said [insert stupid thing]?" &nbsp; Of course, there are some flaws inherent in keeping a diary.&nbsp; The first of which is, as I alluded to before, a matter of the linguistic limitations of the author.&nbsp; How many times have you thought a thought without thinking of it in words?&nbsp; It's perfectly clear to you in your head, but the moment you try to put it to paper or explain it to a friend...you are unable to harness the words necessary to&nbsp;sufficiently express&nbsp;this thought.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Assuming that the&nbsp;thoughts are able to be shared through words.&nbsp; It now becomes a matter of deciding just how much the writer is willing to put into words.&nbsp; I firmly believe that one of the most frightening things in this world is truly understanding yourself.&nbsp; I have yet to meet a person who has not, in some way or another, denied themselves some small truth about their own fears, weaknesses, or shortcomings.&nbsp; As I write, I am at constant battle with myself over how deep into my own mind I am willing to delve.&nbsp; My hope is that, with time, I will find a level of comfort with myself that allows my words to flow uninhibited.&nbsp; For now though, everything I write will likely be a few mental steps short of their potential conclusion. &nbsp; Perhaps the most limiting element of blogging is that it takes&nbsp;the previously&nbsp;elxclusively private practice of keeping a diary and puts it on the most public of forums.&nbsp; Whereas diaries are tucked away in the secret compartment of our closet, behind the shoe box filled with the complete set of 1987 Topps baseball cards, latched with&nbsp;the proverbial&nbsp;small brass lock, for only the writer's eyes to see...blogs are available for the entire world to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;Family, friends,&nbsp;colleagues, and even total strangers are able to read what I write.&nbsp; With&nbsp;so many prying eyes ready to read, the words I type will undoubtedly go through editing and reworking before I approve them for public viewing.&nbsp; Anything shared over blogs are shaped to create a persona that the writer is comfortable being perceived as. &nbsp; For instance, I'm certain that any stories of my&nbsp;triumphs&nbsp;or successes will be toned down so as not to come across as self-serving or conceited and that the most despicable of my thoughts or actions will be ommitted so as not to come across as a&nbsp;complete jackass.&nbsp; Maybe the best advice I can offer is that whenever you read something on my blog that makes me look like a good and decent person, I've only written it because I'm an egomaniac and I want you to love me.&nbsp; And when you read something that makes me look like a scummy piece of shit...chances are I've actually done something much worse and that I am indeed a jackass. &nbsp; All of the above is dependent upon&nbsp;laziness.&nbsp; Or lack thereof.&nbsp; Everytime I tried to begin a journal in the past, I've submitted a few entries, gotten extremely lazy, and subsequently stopped the process altogether.&nbsp; When I was in Australia, I promised myself to keep a journal detailing my exploits down under.&nbsp; Through my first two nights, I was a perfect 2 for 2...sizing up my new roommate and surroundings and expressing my excitement.&nbsp; Six months later, while packing up my belongings for my return back home, I was moved to add an entry to summarize my Aussie experience.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;the 3rd (and final)&nbsp; entry into my journal. &nbsp; Assuming that&nbsp;a writer&nbsp;does stick with it and post entries on a semi-regular basis and assuming that what&nbsp;is written is not just self-congratulatory fluff...it still leaves the element of  you,  the reader.&nbsp; It would be so nice (and totally unrealistic) if a blogger was unconcerned with how readers will react to his/her words.&nbsp; But the very notion of posting&nbsp;one's thoughts on the Internet means that one wants a reaction.&nbsp; We want to know that what we have done is worthwhile, that the thoughts we have are intriguing, that the jokes we tell are funny, and that the stories we tell are captivating.&nbsp; We want to know we are important.&nbsp; If not, we'd still be keeping our thoughts in that tiny locked notebook behind the shoebox in our closet. &nbsp; What this all adds up to is: IF I am motivated far enough beyond lethargy so as to actually compose a post and... IF the thoughts I&nbsp;have are authentic and uncensored and... IF I am able to sufficiently capture my thoughts in words and... IF I deem those words worthy of being posted publicly without significant alteration for fear of public humiliation or ostricization and... IF&nbsp;you are&nbsp;interested enough to read, interpret, and eventually respond to my words... THEN and only then, will this whole blogging&nbsp;nonsense be considered a success &nbsp; So the next time you check out my blog to see whatever words of wisdom I have decided to share with you, remember that what you're reading is nothing more than a textual hot dog...the words that comprise&nbsp;what I've written are&nbsp;little more than&nbsp;unmentionably nausiating&nbsp;fragments of a larger idea...chopped up, minced, processed, recycled, blended, colored and tubed for easier comsumption.&nbsp; In the end, perhaps it's best to just read what's written...enjoy it or&nbsp;hate it...but never ask what the real thoughts and ingredients are.
