      So much for writing every day, but at least I am coming back. I'm not ready to give up on this just yet.  This morning I turned on my computer there on my desktop screen sat American hostage Paul Johnson.  The picture was gruesome, especially if you look at it as the way it must all seem through the eyes of his family members.  I am not at all sure I know which is more terrible--the torture of this innocent man or the torture of his family members as pictures of his torture are displayed for all the nation to see.                       People perish for cold metal.                                                               Alexander Solzhenitsyn

      Today I saw our neighbors staring at our lawn.  They didn't just stare.  They gaped and pointed in horror.  Why?  We have not mown our lawn/jungle in almost two weeks due to a defective mower.  This may not seem like a big deal to 90% of the country, but when you live in middle-America suburbia, its practically a crime.  My husband Paul and I just moved back to Texas from L.A.  For two years we crammed our lives into a 600 sq. foot apartment nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains.  We paid $1000 a month for four walls and a couple hundred feet of poorly-laid carpet and cheap linoleum.  But we were happy, for the most part.  We were grad students, and that tiny little apartment was part of the adventure of it all.  Never mind the several-million dollar homes perched on mountainside and all throughout those rolling hills.  I thrived on dreams of future grandeur and Paul thrived on the satisfaction of putting me through seminary.  In the last month, we have graduated, bought our first home, and moved halfway across the country.  For a full three weeks, the storm of activity kicked up so much dust I could barely see clearly.  When the dust settled, I somehow found myself in middle-America suburbia, in Yuppieville, USA.  And I cried.  I couldn't help it.  I definitely didn't expect it, since owning a home was so different from what I had known for the last two years in L.A.  But still, I wondered, "Is this it?  Is this it for Paul and I?  Are we destined to become like our neighbors, with their immaculate, fresh green lawns and their meticulously dressed little children?  Is the story and the adventure of our lives over?"  Its ridiculous, I know.  I guess what I want is to live more lives than one.

      When I woke up this morning, and shuffled upstairs to my home office with my L.A. coffee mug brimming with Starbucks coffee, I had no idea what a blog was. Nine hours later, I have skimmed the most popular blogs during my daily surf and have decided to dive in and blog.   I figure blogging will help me in two ways: First, it will hold me accountable to writing most days--if not everyday. Second, it will allow me to vent all those thoughts that run rampant in my mind--from the rambling to the ridiculous. Either way, I win. And maybe, someday, other people out there will too.
