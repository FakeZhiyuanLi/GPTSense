      haha... i was reading my best fren's blog and i find this topic rather interesting. she got this habit of like diggin holes off her lips. something like peelin off the skin of her lips till like it bleeds. so i jz wonder, birds of a kind flock together huh?! coz i myself have this one peculiar habit too. i dun peel skin off my lips, but i peel skin off my fingers. jz at the cuticles... i dun like the hard dry feelin of my cuticle skin so, i'll jz by hook or by crook peel it off until it bleeds. and only when i see it bleed, i'd stop. tho i actually feel bad abt the bleeding, it doesnt really stop me from doin it when the wound heals. it's pretty disgusting sight actually, especially after bath and it got contact with water, the skin is like wrinkled. man, that's ugly... usually, i start peelin skin of my cuticles when i feel stressed up, or extremely bored. haha... i think peelin of those skin take me away from my problems for a while and keeping me busy when i have nothing to do. i often get nagged by my darlin, but i think that's the only thing i nv listen to him, coz i basically continue doin so after all the reprimand... hahaha...  unlike my fren she love doin so, i dun wanna do it, but it's really hard to control myself...

      hi people, im currently in melaka. o some place where i name it HELL. well, school started here... first class today morning at 9... went with "duno what's happening" feeling the whole day. first lesson by prof mokhtar on monday 9am isnt really something very encouraging. damn, he's a good lecturer, rather somewhat too good taht i couldnt even understand a thingy he's teaching. ok, so this sem he's going to teach us something of "Strategic Information System Planning"... sounds cool, does it?! neigh! it's damn boring theoretical stuffs. and i HATE this kinda subject. so, as usual, im staring at him the whole session with my mind wondering to my bf... his birthday is coming soon and i duno what to get for him. *heeeeelp* ok, back to the lesson... and after the class, prof told us that next week would be some presentation for individual assignment, and as he was calling out the names, i was telling kit (my gal fren sat next to me) taht we (she n i) wont b so "lucky" ba coz the gal sitting rite in front of me jz got called and tot that we might be spared! ahhaha! then God was so kind and allowed my name to be called by prof!!!! damn, i tot of skipping class next week and now my plans are all crushed. *sob sob sob sob sob* the only consolation i got today is that i get to have my network at my house in melaka set up. at least now im connected still to the world...

      somebody help! it's 1.40 in the morning and i cant get to sleep! i put the blame on the 2 cuppa caffeine after dinner... hmm... ok... i went to the nite market ( pasar malam ) in my hometown, Pontian, on friday... hadnt been there for a long time... lemme count... i think, it can be easily more than 8 months. it was kinda nostalgia, ya know. I used to be like, going there almost everyweek when i was still studyin in my secondary school yrs, and now, only get to go like once in 8 months. ha, so the moment i reach there, a lot of memories jz started playing in my mind. as i walk along the throng of ppl, sigh, i think abt how my ma and i used to squeeze among these ppl to get thru... haha...  hmm, went to buy my favourite  tau hue  (jelly bean) and  tau hue jui  (soya bean water)... then went to by some chinese  kueh  of  kueh lapis  (multilayered  kueh ) and  ku chai kueh ... and my! they were delicious and is delicious still... oh ya! and tehre was this  keropok lekor  also, which is my ma all time favourite...  After spending sucha long time in KL and in Melaka, I jz want to devour everything in the nite market. haha... when i told my darling abt it, he actually had to remind me of my "diet plan"... hahaha! ya ya, i do have a diet plan, but heck care on that day! hahaha...

Know what, the letter was sent in red envelop and I got the shock of my life, thinking, OMG, who's getting married?!?!?!? hahaha, well, most of my best gal frens are attached mah ;) anyway, the thing i received is about 12SI 2nd Anniversary promotions erm, erm, offer cards?! no way, it's only like the map/floorplan of their club premise... u see, the map is printed on 8 cards and ya gotta join em up to get da whole map, somethin like a puzzle. a cute way of promoting isnt it?! there's like DJs performing on the 18th and 20th of Aug. Funk D'Void from Scotland will be in da house on the 18th and John Creamer on the 20th. I dunno who are they anyway, i jz type it out from da promotion cards :D Too bad kel isnt here, else we can go partay ya! ehhehe... i tot of asking LeongLeong to belanja minum in 12SI, since i got the ladies' card (entitled to 15% on all bottle puchase worrr, Leong!) and there's like events going on, but they (LeongLeong+gang) are lazy to shake their bon bon, and since most of the events are in atmosphere-the club, all da more they dun wanna go. I think i'd love to explore bliss-the lounge more, anyway... oh you see, 12SI consist of atmos-the club, bliss-the lounge, barfly-the bar and gerai-the cafe. some sorta "bao ka liou" kinda club which like cater to all sortsa ppl around. oh what's da different between da lounge and da bar?! can someone tell me?!

      This is the title of the show i was watching earlier. 2 women were sent to LA for like some makeovers to like cut and sew away those parts they hated. the results after 8 weeks were awesome man! i now pledge on believing the power of plastic surgury and cosmetics man! then i was thinking to myself, if i were to have a extreme makeover as well, what would i change?!... hmm... my past... i duno why, this thought jz came into my mind. the only thing i want to change in my life is my past. well, not to say that i have a bad past, but still i think it could have been better. i could have done better in STPM and went into like more prestigous Uni, I could have done this, i could have done that... sigh... i know there's like no turning back, but ... but... but...  what the hell im talking about here.... urgh! maybe it's time to get some sleep!

      erm, seriusly, I dun think that's a good idea!   *hardware = barangkeras                 *software = baranglembut                 *joystick = batang gembira                 *plug and play = cucuk dan main                 *port = lubang                 *server = pelayan                 *client = pelanggan                    Try translating this:                 ENGLISH :                  That server gives a plug and play service to the clients using either hardware or software joystick.The joystick goes into the port of the client."       BAHASA :                  Pelayan itu memberi pelanggannya layanan cucuk dan main dengan menggunakan batang gembira jenis keras atau lembut.Batang gembira itu dimasukkan ke dalam lubang pelanggan."
