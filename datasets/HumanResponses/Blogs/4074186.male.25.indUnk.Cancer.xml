      I'm the Electric Hellbilly, 665th Transgalactic Hyperbike Champion, Junior Division. These are my stories. They are inane and useless, full of mind-numbing niggling and general buffoonery. Enjoy them at your own risk.  The Electric Hellbilly

      My friend Ronda came in late to work yesterday. She was out jogging when a guy riding in the passenger side of an old pick-up truck threw his cup of McDonald's parfait at her. She freaked out at the first sensation of impact, and dropped to the ground as if she'd been shot. She had no clue what hit her until she saw the fruit stuck to her. The truck driver and the parfait-thrower kept on going, but someone at the intersection who saw what happened wrote down their license plate number. So Ronda called the cops. They caught the guy. He had to write her an "official letter of apology" (what makes it "official"?), is being charged with assault, and has a court date set sometime next month. Ronda's pressing charges.  Ever seen Mrs. Doubtfire? "It was a drive-by fruiting!"  -----------------------------------------  My sister starts teaching again on August 19. That means I have the afternoons to myself.  I need a new routine. I want to start writing again. I mean,  really  writing again. I haven't finished a story in over 7 years. My last major project was a screenplay I started my senior year in high school called  El Bandido . It was a blatant  Desperado  knock-off ("homage, thank you"). Lots of cussing and gun-fights. The first scene took place in a seedy Mexican dive bar called  El Mundo Cerveza . I got about 25 pages into it before getting side-tracked with something else...  Ever since then, I've tried to start new projects. A burgeoning space opera epic, a couple of hard-boiled Batman stories... At one point I remembered writing about me, and my life, and my friends' lives... This was during school, of course, when I saw them almost every day... But now, 5 years later, it's just me. Well, me, my sister, and my little 2-year-old niece. All of my friends are grown-up, married, moved on. They have careers and kids. They've begun new lives, and I'm still here, stuck dwaddling in the past like some heart-sick nostalgic fool. I can't write about them anymore. Our adventures are over. So now I have to invent them. And heroes make inventing stories so much easier.  Well, dammit, the days of me not finishing anything are  OVER . I'm starting a new schedule. Every Monday thru Friday, starting on the 19th, I'm going to wake up at 9:00 AM, sit down in front of the computer upstairs, and WRITE -- WRITE, WRITE, WRITE -- for 5 hours. Non-stop. No breaks. Just writing. And I'm setting a goal for myself. Say, a 10 page short story. I'm not sure how many words that would be, but I'll figure that out after I write my first short story. And no sitting in front of a blank moniter for 2 hours, thinking of something to say. I'm just going to type. Let my fingers move. I'm sure 99% of what ends up on screen is going to be crap. But that's the beauty of editing. You can turn shit into shinola.  Pardon the language.  Anyway, that's my new daily schedule. If I want to  be  a writer, then I have to   write   something. And finish it.  I'll be keeping a daily record of my progess on the blog. Not that anyone ever reads this thing, but I'm doing it for my own sake. Posterity.  -----------------------------------------  My grandparents live in Cape Coral, Florida. About 2 hours west of Miami, on the Gulf Coast. Right now Charley's closing in on Key West, and by mid-afternoon it'll be on top of South-West Florida. Which means Cape Coral.  The street my grandparents live on is the very first street to flood, in even the smallest rain storms. A hurricane could probably submerge half their house, if not all of it. Cape Coral is nothing but a network of canals and harbors, anyway. All water.  I don't know if the county is going to make the residents evacuate, but my grandfather is refusing. He's getting stubborn in his old age. He's old-school Irish. All of his closest friends are dead, his wife hates their lives, and their health is failing. They're heavy wine drinkers, and chain-smokers. Or rather, they used to be. But I have a suspicion they sneak here and there.   This is my grandfather, Popu, shaking his fist at the Universe.  Dad can't talk him out of it. He's dead-set on staying right where he is, come hell or high water, literally.   I guess we'll know what happens tomorrow, won't we?  -----------------------------------------  I still haven't heard from you. Wow. We talked almost every day for two and a half years, and you can't think of what to say to me? No. No, I think maybe it's because you DON'T have anything to say to me. Please prove me wrong. Because I can't believe I've lost my best friend.

      Maybe it's simply b/c you don't care, really. It's a non-issue for you. Maybe that's why you can't think of what to say to me.

      40 oz. and a pack of smokes. Loud music, to drown out the Last Conversation looping in my head.  Trying to arm-wrestle Love never ends up in victory; and suddenly the universe whirls upon you, and you sit there with pie on your face, a fool to your own inanities. What a tidal wave of arrogance, what a thunderbolt of hubris, that I should be knocked down this hard. But It put me right where I needed to be, I guess. This is where I belong.  I only wish it didn't end the way it did. I wish I could've looked her in the eyes when I said good-bye.  But I'm a man, I suppose, and a real man wouldn't tread in the past. I will not be ruled by the capriciousness of my emotions, or the stabbing pain of memories turned sour. I am a man of decision. And I choose to accept the rich treasures of the future.   Someday, I will find someone who will love  me .
