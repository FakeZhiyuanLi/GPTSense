      I really hate when people talk to you, but when someone else "better" comes along, they ditch you. I know I do it, and I feel bad looking back at it, but really. If you're having a convo with someone, don't leave in the middle just b/c someone else came along. It kinda makes you feel like shit. While on the subject of feeling like shit...  I hate guys who flirt with you when they have a  GIRLFRIEND . This happens to me on a regular basis...and not just with one guy either...there is at least two of them who do it . It's rather frusterating b/c you know that nothing is going to happen with them, but you can't help but hope. I'm like that. Not until I am throughly degraded, will I come off him. Boys are so frusterating! Manuals would make the world much easier. But then you wouldn't be discovering these things about them yourself. Was it on here that I bitched about male memories? No? Well here it goes...  A guys memory should span for at least two years previous. If you know someone, then remember them when you see them again. If you say you are going to do something, then do it. Don't forget and blame it on your pea sized intellect. You do this... and I will do the same. So laugh at me for my wishes, but I'm guessing there are things guys wish upon girls. So maybe the reason I don't approach a certain  delicious senior  is because  I AM A CHICKENSHIT , but maybe it's because I'm hoping he will approach me first. I've always wished that there was a day when the whole world would freeze except me and I could ask people questions in which I would only receive true answers. This way I could know how some people really felt about me. So I wouldnt have to hear about it from word of mouth or from a blog. Not that people write about me.   On the bright side I got to do yoga with Joe, Leah, Josh and Allison on Wednesday. That was fun, although my back hurts. I also get to miss school Monday to go to Honor's Band all day. Which means boys...mmm. But then comes Tuesday...and I'll never see them again...until next year when one of them is in Russia. Why would anyone want to go to Russia anyways? Whats there? Snow? Dirt? Anything we don't have here? No! Damn Russia and its opportunities.

      Damn it, I had something good to write about and I totally forgot it. Oh! I remembered.  Why do gross people insist on telling all of us about their sex life? I don't want to hear how last night was the best yet. Or how you've beat your boyfriend on abstaining from sex longer. This is all stuff I, who have NO LIFE in general (not to even mention a sex life), DON'T WANT TO HEAR. Tell your boyfriend. Tell your girlfriend. But don't tell me. Or the class. That just makes me want to vomit. Like the other day when someone told me that they know someone who wants this nasty dirty penisless asshole of a guy...o wait...i dated him. Yes, thats right....you all know who I'm talking about. The eyebrowless wonder. Kudos to Leah on the name. Gross. That made me want to run into the bathroom, stick my head in the toilet and toss everything I have eaten in the last week into that porcelain bowl.   Now that that feeling is over...I understand my math homework! Thanks to Schooley. Woohoo! Go Schooley for being able to teach me math!

      SNOW DAYS!!!! Multiple snowdays! Brain overload....My mom got the call tuesday morning at 4:30 and then last night at 10:30. O the wonderfulness. And once my dimwit brother comes inside with the boots, I'm going outside to frolic in the snow and make snow angels. THen i'm makin' cookies and doing yoga with joe, leah and josh! yea!   Checked out band camp yesterday with mom and sutton. Airconditioned rooms, climbing wall, high ropes course, new go-carts, good food, did i mention airconditioning? Looks like senior year at band camp will be the best. My brother wants to come up and spend the night one night....i suggested sticking him in with the senior boys and see who comes out alive. My bet is he will be duct-taped and handcuffed in the bathroom. Might do him some good. So if any of you future senior boys wanna give my mom a call on why christopher should sleep in your room, go ahead.

       urlLink    Tis the leap year and nothing has changed. Oh the joys of Sunday. When I get to figure out how to record for band auditions, get better (damn cold) and take a bath! Mmm, baths. I liked the comic above b/c it made me laugh. Plus I'm still trying to figure out how this whole blog thing works. I think I'm gonna end up recording tomorrow during 2nd or 3rd hour b/c my c.d. players all suck. We have 3 in the house and none of them record. i don't mind...thats one more day of practicing.   In other news, I think I have gotten all traces of the ex-boyfriend person out of my house. It felt really great ripping pages out of a journal that had to do with him. Hey, it was a perfectly good journal...and I'm always pressed for journals. Anyways, among other things, a frame he got me has been inserted with a picture of another guy! Woohoo. Go me. And I should just burn that candle and get it over with. I'm off to take a long bath...maybe two hours if I'm lucky. Gotta find a paper for AP English too.  I think I'll submit this one...                                                                               Sarah the “Princess”               My name, though overused and common, is special. I can walk down the hall and hear my name as five other girls turn around at the same time. There are so many of us, but we all have different meanings in our names specific to ourselves. To me, Sarah is my parent’s first child. She is an honor roll student. She is the girl who achieves what she wants.  	When I was born, my parents had three names picked out for their newborn child. Sarah wasn’t one of them. I could have been a Kathleen, Abigail or Maria. When I was finally there, in front of their eyes, Kathleen and Abigail seemed too long for such a tiny baby. Maria was considered, but then discarded because a suitable middle name could not be found. Sarah was then thought up as a soft, delicate name. Three days after my birth, Sarah Marie was chosen.              In the Hebrew language, Sarah means “princess”. Sarah is also mentioned in the Bible. She is the wife of Abraham. She gives birth to a son named Isaac at the age of 90. She was not a princess. Neither are the hundreds of other Sarah’s throughout the world. For the large number of us named Sarah, we are collectively meant as princesses. What about us as individuals? Some are rich, some are poor, while others, like Sarah in The Little Princess are princesses in their minds eye. Over the years, I have wanted to change my name countless times. I wanted something exotic and different, something no one else had, so I could be different from everyone else. I now know that I make myself different, not my name. Though my name has been regretted in the past, now I accept it as who I am and who I will become.

      The dinner was rather boring. The food was kinda cold and although i got to talk to people, it went late and I would rather be using this time to be seeing a movie...which I should have done. Taryn and Allison both said something about maybe seeing a movie, but that doesn't sound all that enjoyable. While we were warming up...Leah looks over at two people and tells me..."Sarah, she keeps inching closer to him...like a snail. She looks like a snail." Even though this was really mean, it was true and now I kinda feel bad. Oh well. I don't really care.

      I'm currently @ work waiting for the next 57 minutes to go by so I can go to the spaghetti dinner. Not that I want to be there, but I also don't want to go home and have to put up with my dad and brother. So, this all means that I have to go straight from work to school. I also like having my own car at school b/c then I can leave whenever I want. This pretty much means when I'm done eating and playing.  I went to Pinckney's hockey game last night and man was it awful. Not in the sence that there wasn't much action, but that they lost....really badly. I picked up Abbey and ran through Burger King for her dinner, then proceeded to go to Hartland. My parents didn't quite know that the game was in Hartland...and they don't need to know. Anyways...I got lost. Abbey was giving directions and they were coming a bit too late, so when she said I needed to be in the next lane, she said so when I couldn't get over. This added at least 10 minutes for turn arounds. Then the genius' of Hartland decided that the expressway will run one way and you have to make a Michigan U-turn to get places. Wow do I hate them. This is not to mention that the arena is NOT clearly marked. I missed Arena Dr. once and then when we went around again, almost the second time. It's dark, and you don't know what you're doing. Go Hartland People!

      Where do guys get off on saying that every time a girl is in a bad mood that she is on her period? Because guys, look at yourselves....you have got to go through some sort of guy PMS b/c you are just as bitchy as we are. It makes me mad when guys get mad at you for not talking to them, but when they are in a bad mood, it's all ok just because they are GUYS. Who died and made you God? Huh? You do NOT have the right to bitch at me or ignore me b/c you have a stick up your ass. And mood swings? Ya that goes for ya too guys. So go take a Tylenol and pull out the stick so you can join the world in the quest for wutever it is we are looking for.

      I want to be able to use subliminal messages. Not in the advertising sense, but in the human being sense. I want to be able to be talking about something....say band.....but subliminally sending messages about something else....like kissing a boy.....to this person. But I don't want to have to do it outright...."The band is playing (kiss me you idiot) Saturday at 7:30 (right now or I'll smack you) so you should be there round 7:00." That's too obvious. So I want the power of subliminal messages....  Of course there is always being telepatic. While having the same conversation. I could be thinking to this person...kiss me you idiot....and then....right now or I'll smack you....I want these powers. Of course I also want to be a tree.

      If the world were mine to rule, everyone would have a large amount of respect for John Mayer and The Wallflowers. Ultimately, I think they are the greatest ever with the exceptions of The Beach Boys, the Eagles and Bob Seager.   Am I so transparent that people know things I don't tell them? Take for today for example...there's this guy I kinda sorta like...okay, i've liked him on and off for a year or so....anyways, I don't know if he actually likes me for me or if he's using me because he just broke up with his girlfriend. So I talked to 2 people about it and I didn't say his name, but they guessed it in like 10 seconds. Anyways, I don't know what to do and this frusterates me to NO END. It doesn't help that we're doing sex-ed in health for the next couple of weeks. Just shoot me now and get it over with.

      1. He thinks he's gay, but his religion won't let him be gay, so he pretends to like girls.  2. Hark! It is Jericho!  3. Did you know you can get an STD from sex?  4. Take him and use him!     My world is full of Venezuelan boys.     Older boys, thats where the fun is.     I want action!     You have to come up for air sometime.  5. If I were in a fight, I would want stumps. Because stumps are sharper.     There's a tooth in my eye.  6. Date as much as you can. Promicuous sex is the answer.  So who said these things? Your choices are.....Bob, Megan, Me, Kelli, Mark and Sutton. There were a couple more things people have said...but they are terribly mean to some other people (cough Eric cough) and I am in a wonderfully good mood today, so I'm gonna be nice.   Lotsa love.....Me!

      "All guys think about is sex"  We have all heard the "facts" about men, Men think about sex every six seconds. Well I'm sick of it. Women are JUST as bad. All you ladies who are reading this getting all up and offended, sit back, relax, and just hear me out. I do admit guys do think about sex an awful lot. But all I'm saying is that it's not just us. There have been numerous times that I have been sitting in class, trying to sleep, and I overhear some conversations. Now I am sorry if it seems like eavesdropping, but it's kind of hard to ignore it when they are sitting right next to you. I would say that the majority of the conversations of the girls I have overheard involve "hot boys" or sex. Also when I have been with some of my female friends I hear this phrase quite often "Oh now he's a cutie" or some variation of that phrase. Now I'm not saying that guys don't talk about women and sex, cause they do. But the difference is guys will openly admit that they think about sex. So what do I suggest? Ladies stop saying that all guys think is about is sex, because you do too. Just keep it fair. Both sexes think about sex, it's nature, live with it.

      It was snowing earlier....and I don't like the snow anymore. I like the  urlLink flowers ...the colorful happy lillies and daisys and roses and the other pretty flowers. On the bright side, snow does lead to a snow day. We obviously won't have one tomorrow since its 34 degrees out and that doesn't allow for snowdays.   Tomorrow I must go to work where I will shelve books for a few hours. Not so appealing right now. I just realized that I should be practicing. Auditions are on Friday and i'm still short a scale or two. I think i'll be okay.   I watched The Princess Bride earlier. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. Pretty decent book too. It's really amazing how many movies are based on books. It's like the directors can't come up with their own ideas, so they have to take an authors. I don't mean to dis such great works such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by Crichton or Clancy, but really. The books are usually better anyways. The only real movie I can remember that was better then the book was Tuck Everlasting. The book was only something like 150 pages and that only lasts me an hour or so of reading time. The whole issue with if living forever is good or bad makes you think. If you met someone who you fell in love with would you drink from the spring or would you listen to Angus Tuck and scamper away to live you short life in peace and tranquility? What happens if you and this person have a kid? Does it live forever too? Or does it die and age. That could kill a person just like it killed the inside of Miles Tuck. Think about this for a second. Can you really love someone so much that you are willing to literally spend eternity with them? What happens when the sun explodes and Earth is shattered into a million pieces? Would you still live? You would be dead because of the heat and because of the lack of oxygen in space, but like the horse who was shot....would you live? Ponder this for a few more seconds because it really does make you think. What would you do? I have to admit that I cried at the end of that movie when poor Jesse Tuck comes back to find that his beloved Winnie has married another, fathered his children and then died. It makes me want to cry now. I could write about this for ages, but alas, I don't have the time. I must practice my clarinetamophone and be back in time to have a riviting discussion on the logistics of liking someone else but still dating someone completely different. If you're reading this now....you know who you are.

      I'm supposed to audition for Wind Ensemble tomorrow and I am thinking that I want to kill the person who came up with scales....especially melodic minors. We have to have 9 scales memorized for this shindig and I only know 7 by heart. My extra piece is shaky too. I'm beginning to doubt the greatness of my clarinet playing abilities. This might be because my bedroom acoustics. Hmm, I should looks into that. Anyways, I just got yelled at by my dad because I am wearing slippers, and when I wear slippers I drag my feet to keep them on....so he yelled at me to pick them up. Dumb bastard. Screw him. More on the jackassness of my dad at a later date. I get to see the Pistons tomorrow...Woohoo....

      Boys should definitely not be able to smell so very good. Especially when I'm talking about that certain band guy who I have been on and off of since at least freshmen year. Smelling good things just leads you to more thoughts about them, and you shouldn't think about them in this way.   On a happier less boy-crazy note, we almost beat Howell at Quizbowl today. I got moved to JV (tears) but the questions are much easier and I managed to answer 9 questions correctly! We would have won this game if the final buzzer hadn't gone off. It made me really mad. With that 15 points and any possible bonus points, we would have won. The coach on Howell's team was a jackass. He kept whispering things to his team about doing better. It was terribly frusterating. Grrr monkeys to him.

      It seems like it has been ages since I last wrote and not all that much has happened. Yesterday was Solo & Ensemble, so Leah, Joe and I made the trek to Farmington-Harrison High School to play in front of that nice judge man. Except he gave us a 2. Not bad, but we could have done better. I was terribly excited because Mr. Judge said I had the best staccato! Go me! Joe's sucks, but he tried and did pretty swell. Along with S&E yesterday, it was Valentines Day. WooHoo! Let's rub it in my face that I have no significant other. Sitting in the backseat of the Yukon with Josh and Leah was rather depressing in that way. No offense guys, I love you, but Valentines Day just sucks. On the brighter side, Josh and Missy and their kidlits came over for dinner last night. Sierra and Macy are the cutest kids in the whole world and are always so happy!  While I was at S&E, we passed by the brass sextet. Bob's mom tells me i'm cute with my hair cut this way and Jason's mom comes in and agrees. How come everyone's moms like me, but none of the guys do. Not that I want Bob and/or Jason, but really. Do do do do do....I'm waiting for Abbey to get off work so we can go see a movie. We planned on doing that sometime over break and obviously we haven't had time to.   On Friday, Mom and I went to Kohl's and went through all the sale shelves....I found 2 shirts for $7.00, and pair of red pants for $10.00 and a great tank-top for $8.00. I love sales. Saturday has already been written about and tomorrow will be filled with reading, some practicing of the clarinet and some homework.

      Felt REALLY stupid today. Ash wasn't here, so I brought my math homework to do. I was struggling through word problems, and Josh sits down next to me and give me the equation and then the answer. He's in the Geometry/Algebra class. Darn him for knowing more then me. Rrrr...  On the bright side, I got a 4.0 on my report card! Go me. Almost beat Tecumseh at the Quizbowl match yesterday. Varsity lost by 15-20 and JV kicked some major ass. Today was a rather blah day. I was really exhausted from who knows what and all I wanted to do was crawl back into bed. I settled for baggy jeans and a big sweatshirt.

      Alas, said subject of my post is taken. Dave/David/Davey Tabbert is not single. But dating someone. Tear. It was fun checking him out while it lasted and Kim and Kelli must agree that he is oh so yummy. Had fun today b/c I didn't have to go to school. Go Honor's Band! I'm hoping for another snow day tomorrow....ICE DANCE ICE DANCE ICE DANCE!

      For those of you who have seen the movie "What Women Want," you will know exactly what scene I am talking about. I had this happen to me today. I was sitting in class, and the guy in front of me was sitting in a position that I had a relatively good view of his ass. Mind you, guys asses aren't all that great to look at anyways since they are covered in layers of denim or khaki, but they are there nontheless. So, I was sitting there and I glanced up and looked at his ass. Then I realized what I was doing, registered that I was looking at his ass, and immediately did it again. The scene from the movie is basically the same except Helen Hunt is checking out Mel Gibson's crotch. Made me remember the movie. Made me laugh b/c I was checking someone out. These are the days where I do love high school.

      I've been thinking a lot lately. Wow right? Lol. But the things I've been thinking about are relatively serious. Today I was thinking...what would happen if one thing changed in a situation. Any little thing. For example, if I had decided to play the trumpet instead of the clarinet. Would I have been any good at it? Would Jason and I still have dated? Here's another one. What if I had stayed on flags? What if I had an older sibling? What if Eric and I had stayed broken up in December? What if...there are so many possibilities in life. It's mind blowing.  The other major thought I've had this week mostly is this: Having a crush on someone who you value as a friend is a recipe for disaster. There are a couple of people who I wish I had not had a crush on simply because the relationship between us has shifted. I miss the talks that we had. The one real perk about that thought is that Jason and I are friends now. Back when we dated (does it even count as dating?) we hardly knew each other. Now we talk and it's all good. But Jason is not who I am talking about. I am talking about J@# and J&$^. I am still not sure I want to tell the world about these people. Sorry, but you can probably figure out who I am talking about. Anyways, I am still good friends with the one, but the other has changed. This person used to tell me who he liked and if he was having a problem with his girlfriend. As much as I didn't like hearing about it since I liked him, I listened, and I gave advice. Those were the days. Now it's just weird. So, to you, I personally am sorry that it escalated past friendship. I wish everything would go back about a month and a half or so...maybe 2 just to be safe. I think the person I am talking about has given up on me. Don't. Give up on me I mean. I'm not always a bitch, I'm not always moody, I'm not always lovestruck. Smile and make the world happy.  Abbey told me this today: "In a world of pollution, profanity, adolescence, zits, broccoli, racism, ozone depletion, sexism, stupid guys, and PMS, why the hell do people still tell me to have a nice day?"

      There are always some lyrics that I really love....here are some of them  You can loose yourself in your courage. The mindless comfort grows when I'm alone with my 'great' plans.   Jimmy Eat World - For Me This Is Heaven   I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same  The Wallflowers - One Headlight   My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy.  Dashboard Confessional - Hands Down   It's so complicated, I'm so frustrated, I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away, I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay, Should I say it, should I tell you how I feel, Oh, I want you to know, But then again I don't, It's so complicated.   Carolyn Dawn Johnson - Complicated   Have you ever loved somebody so much It makes you cry   Brandy - Have You Ever   I want to run through the halls of my high school I want to scream at the top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world just a lie you've got to rise above   John Mayer- No Such Thing   Love is a many splendred thing, love  Lift us up where we belong  All you need is love   Ewan McGregor - Elephant Love Medly   There are also certain songs that if I hear, I think of someone. Maybe it was a song we sang together, or a memory that has that song in the background. Or a song that reminds you of someone, just because. It happens. Certain songs like that make me smile and remember the good times I had with that person. Then there are those other ones that I just flick off when they come on the radio or on a c.d. I'm feeling rather mellow at the moment. Kind of a strang feeling as of late. I've been high strung and bitchy. I'm sorry again. I feel bad. There has to be some sort of meditation I can find that would help me relieve this tension and general feeling of bitchyness. Inhale, Sun Salutation, Exhale, Reach for your toes....Breathe in, Breathe out. Mmm, relaxing already. I haven't cried about anything happening in school involving people in a long time. Friday I was just mad at my drawing. Go me!  In conclusion, I am sorry to the people I have been bitchy to, I like songs, I hate pants and bras (lol) and I want sex. Damn it, I promised not to mention that. Sorry! I didn't mean to say anything. I don't want to be like Kelli and Jason. Breathe in for luck....Go Dashboard!

      I have been a really moody bitch lately, so I'm sorry. I just get frusterated and this is the easiest place to vent at. My life is pretty boring, and there is no one to write about. I'm trying to get over a certain person. I'm also waiting for him to spring the whole dating someone else thing on me soon. He did it last time, he'll probably do it again. Okay, no more boy crap. I'm done with that. I'm not looking for a relationship (or so I tell myself) but just someone to hang out with and be stupid with and ok, any extra perks of dating wouldn't be bad either. I give everyone permission to smack me when I start feeling bad about myself because of a guy. I should be living high school to its fullest damn it!  Pants are stupid. I hate them about as much as I hate bras. We all know how much I hate bras. If you don't, refer to the entree on March 15th. Girls pants nowadays are supposed to be tight, constricting things. I understand this especially if you have a decent body. For example, I can handle wearing tight jeans. I may not have much of an ass, but my stomach doesn't hang over the edge and my thighs aren't massive. The only problem I have with wearing jeans is my mother. I went shopping on Saturday when I came home from work. We went to Kohl's (I love Kohl's) and I grabbed something like 6 pairs of jeans of the wonderful clearance rack. I tried them on and fell in love with a pair of them. You have to understand, these pants fit like no other pants I have ever worn before. They were tight in all the right places, and made me look like I had an ass! They were like an extra skin. These pants should never be removed from my grasp. The horror of the day occured at the cash register. My mom was springing on the clothes that I had picked out (ooo a very see-through t-shirt). That heaven defying pair of pants got scanned, and got rang up for $40. Needless to say, some practical joker had placed the sacred jeans on the 80% off rack even though they weren't 80% off. Here comes the bad part. My mom refused to buy the pants. I wanted to cry. I didn't have enough money to buy them myself, so I had to put them back on the rack. Part of me died that day. I finally found a pair of pants that fit me, and they are ripped from my grasp. Everyone must understand, buying pants for teenage girls is a chore. You have to make sure they fit in the waist, and then in the legs. I have major issues with this. My waist is tiny, and my legs are long. Shorts are another story. Long legs and girls shorts just don't work correctly. I think I am going to live the rest of my life in overalls and pajamas since I have yet to find pants that fit me really well. Blah to pants. Maybe I'll just go around naked. No pants, no bra. See what happens. If anything, I'll have a better chance of getting laid. Shit, this is me talking about boys again. Kill me now.  A quick "Get Well Soon" to Fred. I don't know him, but it's a shame that the teenagers of Pinckney couldn't find anything better to do on a Friday night. There's drugs and alcohol out there, you don't have to beat someone up.

      Today was probably one of the worst days of the last couple of weeks. My drawing got fucked up  again   and when I realized what I had to do to fix it, I had already deleted it and dedrawn most of it.   My "fuck you" list includes Hidalgo (the guy, not the movie) because it seems I have fallen from his favor. Although he did make me smile. Woo hoo. : ) Next is Joe N. He royally f-----d up when he told Tyler about me and the aforementioned Hidalgo. I'd really like to kick his ass 10 times over. Following Joe is definitely the people who have called me prude. Fuck you. You don't know that I am prude. Sure, with Jason, I was...and with Eric... do you blame me? But this does not automatically make me prude.  Prude  - One who is excessively concerned with being or appearing to be proper, modest, or righteous. NOT ME! But calling me prude when you really don't know me all that well is not cool. It's excessively obnoxious. Have I really had the chance to not be prude? Hell, even Kelli won't put out with Jason...her choice...wutever...and Eric....who would? My taste in guys sucks. Sorry Jason, since we're buds and all. I'm not gonna name these guys but let me tell you, someone needs to smack me upside the head. I am stupid. I fall for the ones with girlfriends, or who are really unattractive in multiple ways in hindsight. Hindsight is 20/20 ya know.   After school today, I took Darwin home. I never do that. I have found that driving is really pretty soothing. Like I said, I drove down Darwin and came out on MacGregor. I was driving towards the middle school and approaching Whispering Pines Subdivision. I drove in and drove past Katrina's old house. It made me reminisce of old times in middle school. When we all used to meet in the band room (our first inklings of high school hanging outs) and walk to Katies for pizza, brownies and to trade clothes, do makeup and gossip. The only guys who ever came were Mike and A.j. I remember for one dance, A.j. put on this god awful green crushed velvet looking shirt. It was awful. These were the days when I didn't know that it was mainly cleavage that attracted guys. Driving past places that you have fond memories is very relaxing. It made me feel tons better till I came home to find my dad here. Can't he have a normal job with normal hours and an office away from home? What if I want to have friends over? What if I want to smuggle a boy in? Nope can't do that. Chocolate is the key to a bad day and I am off to drown myself in it.

      I am not a big fan of my bellybutton. The only purpose it has in life is a nine month stint. Once you're born, the only thing it is good for is collecting lint and looking all pruny and wrinkly. It just sits there in the middle of my stomach. Take a close look at your belly button. What is in it? Is there dirt? Jelly? It's nasty. Here's another question. How many people actaully have outies instead of the normal innies? Take a look on the internet. Search under google or your specific search engine for "belly button." It was really quite scary what people put on the world wide web for others to see. I don't want to see your belly button. I have trouble enough looking at mine. My grandpa always told me when I was little "If you don't stop playing with your belly button, your butt is gonna fall off." I wish.  I'm not a big fan of piercing them either. Other then ears and eyebrows, I'm really not a big fan of piercing anything. We were talking about piercings in 6th hour the other day. Someone knew a girl who got her nipples pierced. What in the hell would posses you to do that? Your nipples happen to be a great source of nerve endings. I have one word for the people who pierce them. OUCH! Same for people who pierce their clit's and/or penis's. All I can do is shake my head at you people.    Thoughts of the week:  1. Some people show their good sides at the least suspected moment.  2. My mother is WAY to overprotected. 3. Mrs. Pittaway needs to retire. 4. McDonald's in the morning isn't all that bad.  5. I love not having Quizbowl on Wednesday and Friday! Woo Hoo! Now I get to make cookies!   Quick thanks to Eric Miller who whispered the line of "The Raven" to me and Kendra today. We would have been lost without you!  Fiel, Sarah

      Men need to experience having a period at least once in their life. Do you think they really know how bad it is? Imagine guys, faithfully once a month, for at least a week, you get to bleed from a place that really isn't supposed to bleed. I mean,  blood ! Any other person or animal who bled as much as we have to would be dead. My only saving grace of getting me through this is that wonderful drug called Motrin. On top of numbing the pain, it goes to my head and makes me a bit ditzy. Okay, I'm ditzy anyways, but more so. Oh joys.   I realized today that really stupid things make me happy. Like that fact that Shannon and Eric came back from Wyoming today. And I passed Eric in the hallway...and I could just smile because he was definitely not the last guy I kissed. Do you know how awesome that made 2nd hour? It kicked some ass. Then talking about yummy Dave in 3rd hour. Laughing @ Mrs. Alm and her thoughts about teen sex 4th hour. 6th hour was just great because Josh basically did my drawing for me, out of the goodness of his heart. Lol. That cuts out a week off of me having to do it. Yay!   My dad is looking into buying a house up north. Up on Mullet Lake, there is a little cabin. We've gone up there for 4 or 5 years now and they guy who rents it to us is selling it. So, we either forget about this cabin and keep my grandmas house on Little Portage where our boat is, or we sell Grandma's house and buy the cabin. Kind of a dilemma. I really don't care since I will be going off to college in a year and a half (!!!), but my dad is making a big deal out of it. Wutever.   Days till Chicago: 28 Days till my 18th birthday: 238 Days till we are out of school: 80 Days until we graduate from high school: 433  Health class quote of the day:  Mrs Alm: Abstinence is good in a relationship, because if you don't know the person really well on a mental and emotional level, it's just a two minute get your rocks off. What's the good in that?

      Sunday is the stupidest day of the week. Take this one for example. I have been up since 7:30. Don't ask me why. I didn't go to bed until 12, so by all rights, I should have slept till at least 10. Nope. I was up at 7:30. Now, since I have no homework and no instrument to practice, I have nothing to do for the next 8 or 9 hours. A bath will make at least 2 of these hours go away, but then I'm left with another 7. Dinner, that's at least one. Ahhhh. In general, Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest and relaxation. It is usually the day I use to sleep in since I work Saturday mornings. But Sunday. Auughh. I have no one to talk to since my dad is gone somewhere (woohoo) my mom is doing band stuff (when isn't she?) and my brother is just not talkable this week. No one is online who I can talk to and the bathtub is looking mighty fine. I do have to say that Sunday can be a good day in some cases since it is the one day during the weekend that I never  have  to do anything, so I am basically always free. But overall, I think it's kind of a waste of time.   Yesterday, I had to go to the movies with my parents and my little brother. Shoot me now right? But the movie was good and afterwards while we were waiting for my brother to hurry up and pee....guess which magically delicious boy and his equally yummy brother were coming out of the theater? That's right. Dave and Mike. That totally made my day. 'Cept Dave still has that thing called a girlfriend. Damn me for always picking the one with the girlfriend. Yup. I'm on numero cuatro (number 4 for the spanish impared). There was "The Bob", "Bob", "The Joe", and Dave. Mind you 3 of the 4 aren't their real names. Can't I just find some nice single boy to do? Whoops, did I actually say that?

      My brother got suspended from the bus today. Sucks to be him.  I am probably the easiest person to get to blush. Yesterday, all they had to do was say "padiddle" and I was red. No thanks to Josh. Today Tyler just had to look at me and pucker his lips to make me blush. Darn you two. I would really like to go into all this stuff and the stories behind it, but it's all a long story that I don't care to write about...ever. Maybe one day I will divulge the tail of padiddle at DQ and the ensuing consequences. Not in the near future though. Mind you...I still owe you.  I find, in life, there is always a parable. I had a thought about one today. When you like someone, you want them to like you too. So, you come on strong. The parable is...coming on strong could push them away. But on the other hand, it could make them like you. The other hald of the parable is...you're shy, so you just bask in any attention they give you. This weak emotion you are sending their way could make them just go away, thinking you don't like them...or...they try harder to show that they like you.  My question here is...If you like someone, do you go on strong? or just let it take its course? And if you like someone and you tell them this, then they stop liking you....should they tell you? or just ignore you until you get the picture? My thought on that last one is...tell them...you had enough guts to say you liked them in the first place.   Sorry if this entree bores you, but frankly my dear, I  don't  give a damn.

      To Josh and Tyler for making 6th hour worth it, even if it was at our expense. To Tyler's stupidity and not figuring out who Josh and I were talking about faster. To Leah and Joe for coming up with "attacca your mom's ass" and "THE CLIMAX" To the blue group...we kicked some major health ass! To whoever made Pittaway decide to miss the day! SUB! And finally, to all my pals, amigos, and buddies who always make the day good.

      1. Once you start playing Padiddle, you don't stop. I saw 5 of them on my way to work today...that's only a 10 minute drive. 2. Never tell someone you work with about your weekend. Especially when it's Kim, and especially when when your weekend involves a boy. 3. I AM NOT A FLOOZY. A floozy is someone who is sexually promiscuous. That's not me. Besides, we only kissed once...... 4. Who cares if my blog is boring? At least I am not writing about hating my friends or thinking life sucks.  5. My blog is boring. I promise to write about better things instead of my daily  boring  life.  6. Humbugs to people who are stupid. Just because I say so.

      I was working on one of my logs that are due on Friday for American Lit class. I had gotten through the first 7 chapters, and I saved the file. Then I moved on to chapters 8-14. Went back to look at something from the first chapters, and they were gone! I didn't save them right, or something, and now I want to cry. This majorly sucks. I have 3 logs on "The Witch of Blackbird Pond", 3 logs on "Witch Child", and a visual presentation on both. Excuse me while I go cry.

      I just realized that I am pulling a Megan. Hmmm, now to decide if this a good thing, or a bad thing.   So I hate bras with a passion. They were most definitely designed by a man who wanted to mess with women. I hate wearing them, and I hate buying them. What's with the underwire, and the padded, and the water, and all the other crap that society requires us to shove our boobs in everyday? I want to see a guy wear a bra, and then tell me that it's comfortable. I guess I shouldn't complain, b/c they do give support. Running around would be a bit more difficult without them. But this damn black bra that is now sitting on the desk here SUCKS to high heaven. I would rather go braless for the rest of my life or maybe I will just live in a bathing suit top. That sounds better then having to wear a bra.

      I am going straight to Hell. I hate my father. I can never have things for myself. For example, Abbey and I are going out for ice cream tonight and I also have to buy the rest of the family ice cream. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT SUCKS? This has happened another time, but i'm not talking about that. I think thoughts about people that I would  never  want them to know about. I think about sex  way  too much. The only good things about next week are missing Monday, and having absolutley nothing to do Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after school! Vegging here I come, unless something better comes along. Which is yet to be determined. O...I do owe someone something...hmmm. Maybe I'll think about that. Sounds better then being angry.

      Society today is pretty much based around sex. We are born because of it, told not to have it while it's crammed down our throats by various propaganda, told to have it to get kids, and then we die. What a life. This is all brought up from the fact that we are doing reproductive health in my health class. The teacher said the other day, that if you took a group of adults and a group of teens and told them to line up certain sexual things, the adults would put oral sex after intercourse. This is because our generation views it so casually. Teens put it before intercourse. What is wrong with us? No, let me rephrase that? What is wrong with girls who put a PENIS in their mouths? As Bob put it "mouth screwing." (lol) The idea just grosses me out. It disgusts me. I would rather have sex with someone than give head. Preach at me about this, but i'm not changing my mind on this one. Look around, oral sex is taken  very  lightly at PHS. I can name 5 people off the top of my head who are giving or getting it. The people having sex, it's even more. Not that I am against sex before marriage or anything, because I'm not, but if someone tells me that so-n-so is doing so-n-so, my respect for them goes down the toilet. No, I can't say that....just the gross people who are off makin' babies. I also lose respect for people when they tell me how they got drunk and/or high. Don't tell me. Just leave it to yourself and let me have peace of mind. Thanx  Fridays at work SUCK! Nothing happens. I wanted to go see Hildago, but Allison was late getting here and the tickets were sold out when we got there. We saw Welcome to Mooseport instead. It wasn't too bad. Had some good laughs. The most annoying people sat next to us though. The guy in front of us yelled at them to shut up. Woo Hoo! Go Mr. Person. All in all, I had a pretty good day.   Congrats to Nicky and Brett for their incoming child! Go you guys!

      Tis 6th hour today. Ash is gone  again . I have nothing to do. I don't want to read this book b/c it's kinda sucky. I would rather be reading "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" which by the way was a pretty good book. I have to work tonight. I have never worked a Friday in my life. It's only till 6 and then Allison and I are going to see "Hildago." Sounds like a blast. Of course, I would think of quite a few things I would rather be doing. Not that I don't want to see a movie, but I would rather be ESPing a certain person who I won't get into. That's all kinds of loco. Sutton actually came thru with the pizza, so we got to get out of 4th hour. We watched some more episodes of "Family Guy." That is such a funny show. Ya, that could be an understatement, but wutever. Had pizza, burned my tongue. Blah. :P Okay, so I have another 23 minutes to waste in here and I definitely don't have 23 minutes of writing in my head at the moment. So.....

      Yeah Varsity Quizbowl! Today we had a KVC Tournament. Bob, Nich, Jessica, Kyle and I played and kicked some butt. Okay, we only came in 2nd place, but thats good for us. We never win things like this.   Anyways, today was a blowoff day. We went to 1st hour....blah, but I got a  101%  on the test I thought I failed. Then we went to the band room for 2nd hour to play "O Fortuna" for the KVC people to make them want to come to PHS. Whatever the reason people want to come here is beyond me. So we played a 2 minute song and went back to clase de banda. We headed to Sutton's office and watched and episode of "Family Guy." That is a great show. I have never seen it but I have a feeling I should watch more of it. So that was the first half of my day. I then went to lunch, sat through STD presentations and went back to band. Shannon had brought her bouncy ball again and we played with it. It's really amazing how many hours of enjoyment you can get out of a piece of rubber. So were playing and Josh and Bob got the bright idea of playing baseball with the bouncy ball. That was interesting. Jason joined in and we soon had a riviting game of run away from the high speed bouncy ball going. This turned into keep away which ended in the annihilation of out loving bouncy ball. Jason put his foot down and it just fell apart. :'( Very sad. So we went on to sit and talk. It was pretty much me and Leah at this point. Allison came in and we took her book mark to laugh at the sayings on it. The bookmark is the one that gives you 101 reasons to read....but if you change it to 101 reasons to have sex, its much better. For example, "its cheap" "you can do it alone" "you can do it all day long" etc... So that got old and I went to drafting only to be bored b/c I didn't really want to draw. Sutton promised us pizza after school, but he didn't deliver, so we have to have it tomorrow.   After school was over, the Quizbowl team traversed to Howell to play our games. Interesting times. Got hit with a rolled up newspaper more then once. Now I am home, and I should be off to bed once I have finally come off my high of having a great day. Unless someone dies in the next 2 hours and 42 minutes, it will be a really great day!

      I came home from work looking forward to a tasty dinner, and I have a bowl of tortelini and a piece of yummy cinnamin cake. I nuked the tortelini and went in search of some butter. Alas,  WE HAVE NO BUTTER ! Did I mention tortelini taste like poo without butter? Because they do. So I'm sittin' here eating my scrumdidlyumptious cinnamin cake and wishing we had butter. I should be doing my homework but poo on my homework. Also, I have decided that the word of the day is ULTIMATUM.

      Why is it that I come up with things to say to flirt with a guy an hour after I see him? Do the Gods of love hate me? Can't I come up with something clever when i'm there? This happens with other people and comebacks....but for me....it's flirting. Do you know how frusterating this is? Boys should go die. Make life easier on all of us. Then again....i've gotta love them. You can't live with them, you can't live without them.

      Let me give you the reasons for staying home from school or coming home from school sick.   1. You have a 105 degree temperature. 2. You have broken out in a bright red rash that itches like no other and nothing can be done about it. 3. You get your period and it's one of the particularly bad ones. (vomitting, major cramps, or in case of school it goes thru your pants (AHHH!) 4. Throwing up. 5. Dismemberment 6. Disembowlment 7. Death 8. Hospital stay 9. Being unable to breathe *not to be confused with shortness of breath, with doesn't count.  Having a bit of a sore throat, feeling like your gonna throw up, stomach hurting and any other minorities DON'T COUNT. So stop being a pussy, get dressed, and GO TO SCHOOL LIKE THE REST OF US.  This all stems from coming home to my little brother watching Aladdin. He felt sick. Poor thing. Who doesn't care? ME! He does this  at least  twice a month. I don't even skip out once a month. I bear it with a smile. The only absences I have are from school activities. I'm gonna go back to eating my cherry jello with whipped cream and think about doing my homework. If you can think of any more reasons from staying home ill, tell me and i'll think about posting them in here.

      Okay, so Bob just informed me that you can get comments on Blogs, so I'm back to blogging! Woohoo!   Had festival yesterday and we got a 1! GO US! It was wonderfully exciting. We almost had straight one's too, but the 3rd judge gave us a 2. Cool stuff though, so now we go on to states. After we finished sight reading, Taryn and I packed up and we drove to her house so she could do my hair. After nine very painful braids and countless bobby pins, she was done with my hair. I went home to get ready and then left again to go to Aleko's for dinner. There were 8 of us...Taryn, Me, Josh, Emily D., Emily M., Amber, Krystle, and Andrea. Had soup and too many breadsticks. Then we proceeded to the dance and hour or so late. Met up with Megan and her boy. Saw Leah and Josh. Hung out with Joe and Emmie. It was absolutley adorable b/c Joe and Rachelle danced. I've always knew she wanted him and this was just great. Everyone was happy and looked great. There weren't many people there though. I actually decided to go at the last minute. I had already borrowed Leah's dress and had been debating whether or not to go. Anyways, today I get to trudge though my homework and see if I can study enough for my Trig test tomorrow to get an A on it so I can get an A in the class instead of the A- I have. It's been kind of a crappy day. It can't decide if it wants to be nice out or shitty. I'm hoping for nice.  What is it with this snow? Does the person who is in charge of weather not know IT'S MARCH?!?!!? Snow is over. NO MORE SNOW. This sucks.

      Excuse me while I go smash something against the wall. It seems that is the only real way for me to get all my frustrations out. Today, since I lacked an item to throw, I cried. Yes, I cried in school. I didn't break down or anything. I went into Mrs. Z's room, dropped my stuff on the floor, sat on the desk and felt the tears well up in my eyes. I talked to Alayna and Megan about it a bit. Just the frustrations of my life in general. It's one of those things where I don't want to get upset but I do. I am a very shy person when it comes to guys and how I feel about them. I don't put myself out there b/c I don't to get squashed like a bug. I don't want to get hurt. Of course I'm also rather sexually frusterated....as A.j. put it earlier...I need to be put up against the wall and screwed by someone. Thanks A.j. Obsenity, obsenity, obsenity, obsenity, obsenity, #$@*%, #^$%@*, ^$%@*, ^$%$&. That is all.

      There is this song I stumbled upon the other day that is really sad. Its called "Just Friends." Sung by Gavin DeGraw.   I saw you there last night Standing in the dark You were acting so in love With your hand upon his heart But you were just friends At least that's what you said Now I know better from his fingers in your hair I'll forgive you for what you've done If you say that I'm the one I've had other options too But all I want is you Girl, your body fits me like a glove And you showered me with words of love While you were just friends At least that's what you said Now I know better from his fingers in your hair I'll forgive you for what you've done If you say that I'm the one It's not my style to lay it on the line But you don't leave me with a choice this time Why weren't you true You know I, I trusted you When you were just friends At least that's what you said Now I know better from his fingers in your hair I'll forgive you for what you've done If you say that I'm the one You were just friends Now I know better from his fingers in your hair I'll forgive you for what you've done If you say that I'm the one I'll forgive you for what you've done If you say that I'm the one I'll forgive you for what you've done  If you say that I'm the one I'll forgive you  Anyways...it makes me sad b/c this guy really likes this girl and it seems like she doesn't reciprocate his affection. But he likes her so much, even though he saw her with someone else, he is still willing to take her back. Wish I had someone who liked me. The closest I have is that awfully confusing person. Which leads me into  ¿Por qué deseo besarlo tan gravemente? Why am I such a wimp and so unassertive? Cross your fingers for me....I really need it right now.   For any other feelings about today...please refer to the January 30th entry about guys and their memory. As well as any entries having to do with the intentions of guys.

      Ok, so I don't care if who this is about is reading this. Not so much really. But I'm getting frusterated b/c I just am. Probably because this person's attention isn't always directed towards me, but also at other girls. *Me shaking my fist at other girls* Megan says I've got it bad. But I'm really hoping this isn't true, b/c it will make it so much harder to get over him when nothing happens....or something happens and I muck it up like usual or something goes wrong. (I'm hoping for the something happens that is good) I'm still frusterated though. I have to give kudos to ice cream. Gotta love ice cream. Not to make u feel bad or anything, but I just needed to vent a bit to someone who isn't Megan b/c i think she is getting sick of hearing my crapola.   Fiel! Me

      When people read a certain age, their driver's license's should be taken away. If they are perfectly competent, then they should have extensive testing to see if they are allowed to drive. Elderly driving should not take place because they can't see, hear, or think as clearly as the rest of us. How many old people were in an accident today? O wait. There was at least one on M-36 at round 3:00. How do I know this? Because I was in the other car. My poor baby is now a nice shade of light blue and red. That stupid old lady hit me. Turned right into me. If you want to hear the whole story, just ask me.   On the bright side, I was coming home from shopping with Leah and I bought a great shiny purple tanktop for $3.50. I am in love with Frieda's.

      I was at play rehersal last night doing the whole band on stage thing and we were practicing getting on and off stage. Big deal right? It really wasn't. Here comes the funny part though. I had forgotten my lyre, so I had to stick my music between the two pieces of my clarinet. Well, between the swinging and continual walking backstage, my music fell off. I was angry, so I jumped up and down a couple of times and bent down to get it. Here would be the error in my ways. I bent from the waist instead of the knee so the person in back of me had a prime picture of my ass. This person proceeded to take the opportunity to check out my ass with his mouth open and eyes bugging out. Aj pointed all this out when I stood back up. This person behind me was a certain curly haired freshmen trumpet player. Ahhhh. Well, at least someone is checking out my ass.   Today, for the first time, someone asked me how to spell orgy. We were writing notes in 2nd hour because we had a sub. Catalina was writing to Diego, and I was writing to Raimundo. Cata asked how to spell orgy because she had to write to Diego about the upcoming orgy she wanted to have. Right there was too much information. I'll stop before I release the names of Catalina, Diego, and Raimundo.  I was sitting at work today during my break working on my homework. I was in the back non-fiction section since I was shifting books (definite suckage) and no one could see me. I took this opportunity to take a half hour break. I had finished my math and started writing in my notebook. I was kind of a conversation between the two people living in my head. My "wanting" self, and my "sense" self. Here's what I got:                -How wrong is it that I am still hung up on the same guy as I was at the beginning of the year?                -No! I am not hung up on him damn it. He's younger then me.                -Then why do my thoughts keep heading his way and then down into the gutter?                -Because you want him even if you think you shouldn't.                -It's been a month, going on two, since I kissed a guy. Shoot me now.                 -Shut up!                -Fuck you.                 -No! Fuck me.  Do you see how my mind works? It's not always sex though. It's more just being with someone. It's kinda scaring me since things were good with one person, and now there is a newish person in the picture. But he shouldn't be in the picture since just no! I don't know what's going on anymore. I give up. I give up on boys. I give up on trying to figure them out. Wait I know how the one's mind works. I know he likes me because it is incredibly obvious. Freshmen should learn to be subtle. Good times in the world I guess. But I am missing the attention of someone. A certain someone who I haven't really talked to because I am afraid of being seen as stupid or not good enough. I hate myself. I wish I were outgoing and flirty with the guy(s) I like. Then they would know I like them. Yay, time is up on bitchy Sarah. Happy, sleepy Sarah is taking over and is thinking about boys. Damn it. Can't wait for tomorrow.   I'm looking for a short skirt that I could borrow. Operation "Mess With A Boy" is soon to be in action. Details coming.

      I miss the days of playing in the rain. If I play in the rain now, I get teased about being cold.   I miss the days of sitting outside under the willow tree on a sheet and reading. Dad cut down the willow tree.  I miss the days of skipping out of 6th hour to shoot the shit with Josh and Jason. Good memories.  I miss the days where everyone spoke their minds. No one is honest anymore.  I miss the days when boys were my best friends. Now it's all "Does he like me?" "Do I like him?"  I miss the days of spitting watermelon seeds into the lake. The lake is to shallow for me to swim in anymore.   I miss those days and in the future I will miss my youth. Spend as much time as you can enjoying yourself because you will never forgive yourself if you don't.

      Woohoo! Chicago royally sucked, but I had a great time. Judy, the tour guide, was such a bitch. We went to some cool places, but spent too much time on the buses. Quotes of the trip are:  Someone: Marco! Everyone else: Polo!  Da da dut da da dut da da dut (clap clap) da da dut da da dut da da dut (clap clap) da da dut da da dut da da da da da da dut, da da dut da da dut da da dut (clap clap) (Thanks Katherine for writing all that out)  It's Chicago, what do you expect? - Judy  "Those aren't elevators, those are bathrooms." - Abbey  "My food is possessed. It's conspiricizing against me." - Anthony  "Who's your Santa?" - Megan  A lot of people paired off on the trip. There was this whole crazy triangle of Taryn, Jesse and Devon which was a really lop sided triangle if you ask me. Of kisses and hand holding and movies. Watched four or five movies on the way home (yay Taryn) and I ate more fast food then I have in a long time. I had fun messing around with people. I wasn't too keen on the ice water down my shirt or the bruise on my leg, but they were some fond memories. I'm really in a great mood. I didn't go to school until after 3rd hour today. Sleeping in until 8:30 was really nice. I should go do some homework. I feel like writing though so I'll go write in a journal or something.  I'm still loving how some of the little things guys do just make my day. Even though they shouldn't. Oi vay.

      I checked out a romance book on tape. They edit out the sex scenes. It was hilarious. I got a 4.0 again. This has earned me the nickname "four oh girl" in 6th hour. Thanks guys. Boys are just nutso. Woh. Where did that word come from? Anyways. My spanglish is becoming more severe. I speak in half English sentences to some people now. I'm really tired and I still want to do some of my health homework. I was standing in the shower and I was thinking. I do my best thinking in the shower. I had a million things to write about, and now I have no motivation to write about them. Just like I had no motivation to draw today. Drawing sucks. We need more sub days, but nice sub days. Nice subs who let us leave class. I'm going to Chicago Thursday. Woo Hoo. Can't wait. Again, I have no enthusiasm for writing today, so I will probably find something to bitch about tomorrow.

      "There's nothing better than good sex. But bad sex? A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is better than bad sex."  Billy Joel said that. I was reading quotes yesterday at work and I came across that and I had to laugh.   I want to cry. It is the last day of Spring Break and the only thing I get to do today is Birthday Bash #3. My brother is turning 13 tomorrow, so he had bash #1 Friday with a friend. Yesterday we went to Mongolian Barbecue for dinner, so that was #2, and today the relatives are coming over to have #3. Can't wait for the relatives to come over and have them berate me for my lack of boyfriend, lack of college choices (I want to go to U of M darn it. Live with it.) and my lack of doing anything on Spring Break. Can't wait for that fiasco. Woppee.   My legs are all cut up from walking in the woods this morning. It looks like I was cutting myself. Which I'm not. I don't think I ever could. All the cuts are from the prickly branch thingys. They are really fine cuts, so they sting like no other. I can't have my legs flat on the floor b/c they hit my cuts. What irony. I am saving my clothes I'm taking to Chicago so Mom won't have to do laundry. Which means tomorrow I am wearing a skirt. Yay! Everyone check out my crappy legs.   On the bright side, we're putting up the trampoline when my dad finishes cutting the grass! Yay! Sarah's thighs and stomach are going to hurt tomorrow too! Oi vay. Tomorrow we go back to school and I am glad in some ways. I miss a lot of my friends. I hung out with Abbey a bit and saw Christine once, but that's it. I had some other plans for break, but they didn't happen. I have a feeling they will never happen. My schedule is sucky and my parents job schedule is sucky and the world, in that aspect, is sucky. Oh well......  "Everyone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say. Best friends listen to what you don't say."

      Abbey came over today and we all (my brother, Luke, Abbey, and I) went to Great Escape to go go-carting. It was a blast. I'll leave out some of the funnier details just because now, they are inside jokes and all. Anyways, we came back to my house and played with the two-way radios. That was a ton of fun. I ended up tromping through the woods and a golf course to get into the subdivision by my house. Then we sat on the lawn and talked. We were talking about things we've regretted in high school. It seems like there is one each year. My freshmen year was taking Integrated Science. Sophmore year was dating Eric. This year tops them all since nothing horrible has happened. There is nothing I fully regret. There are things I wish would be a bit different, but nothing totally different. This year has gone by terribly fast and soon we are on to being Seniors. OMG. That's crazy. I'm off to the real world in a year. There are so many things I'm still waiting for out of high school yet.   Today is Friday. Being the last weekday of Spring Break, I'm hoping something significant will happen this weekend. That life-changing, or at least turning point, event of Break. I am excited though. I get to wear my new clothes to school! Yay halter tops!

      Why is it when I come up with a great happy plan, it gets squashed like a bug? A bug I tell you! The Memorial Day Yayness just got flushed. I'm gonna end up at my aunt's house. This sucks along with the 23 I just got on my ACT practice test. I suck at life. (no comments Bob thanks)

      I'm talking about my lotion. Not that anyone cares. Besides, it has absolutley nothing to do with this post.  The most boring thing you will have to do in life is sit through the "State of the City" address of Westland. The mayor has a lisp and it makes you want to laugh everytime she talks. And believe me, she talked for a good hour. At one point she mentioned Cooper Park, but it came out Pooper Park and I think I was the only person in the room to catch it. The only reason I was in Westland for this occasion, was because my aunt was nominated for "Teacher of the Year." Very cool. Plus, I got new clothes and jewelry out of it, so it was worth it.   Life is rather boring at the moment. No, I can't say boring, I was out all day today and I have -ish plans for the rest of the week. -Ish since they aren't in stone yet, just maybe's. It's just stuck in a time warp. Life isn't going anywhere. This could be a good thing since things aren't getting worse, but they aren't getting better. I went shopping with Abbey yesterday. Let me tell you, Abbey sucks at being a girl. I love her to death, and she's my buddy and all, but she won't try on skirts, or anything pink, or anything girly. We ended up getting a white see-throughish shirt. Couldn't find anything for my mom's birthday which is rapidly approaching, as is my brother's.  Which reminds me. Tomorrow, I get the house to myself for the morning and some of the afternoon if my dad doesn't come home. Poor Christopher (sarcasm) has to go to U of M for some tests. These include an ultrasound and an upper GI (?). He's been having stomach aches all the time and they don't know wut it's from. Watch he has cancer or something. Then I'll feel horrible. Here's my advise, pop some Motrin and get over it. Some of us like coming home to an empty house.   I'm kinda bummed since Raimundo hasn't given me a call about the Chupacabra movie yet. I'm hoping he does so soon because I have gossip to spread on to Catalina.   Oh well, it's Wednesday, so Spring Break is about half-way done. Let's see if the rest of the week is better then this half.   Fiel -Sarah!

      As most of you know, I work at a library. I was sitting there Saturday when Marian walked by. You must understand, Marian is a librarian (lol) and has the most amazing work ethic you will ever see. The woman shelf reads. Shelf reading sucks. Back to the story though.  I was sitting there Saturday when Marian walked by. Marian is one of those people who will make you do something is you are just sitting there, so I got up to shelve some books. (I love my job) I took a stack of audio books into the "Recorded Books" section, and saw two parents and their teenage daughter. Now, the daughter is my age (round 17) and I know her from school. I was putting away a book on tape when I hear one of the parents say, "No, I don't this book is sexually appropriate." Dear God. If my parents actually looked at what I read they would be appalled. The amount of sex, drugs, and swearing I digest daily is phenominal. This made me think.   Do people actually record romance books to tape? What do they say when the get to the sex scenes? (There are always two or three) Instead of "And then Jack's fingers had slipped between her legs and found the hot, wet place there. Lou couldn't stifle a moan as his lips came down over hers again, his tongue as unrelenting as his fingers." (from  She Went All the Way ) would it say (in the monotonous voice they have reading) "Jack made love to Lou and it was good." Seriously. How graphic can a book on tape be? I am temped to borrow one and check it out. I have read romances before and I always have to laugh at the sex scenes. For instance, let me take it from the book that last quote came from. "There was no doubt about it: Jack Townsend was warm for her form." I laughed out loud when I read that line. Could it get any more corny? Wait. I'm the one reading it. I guess I'm the stupid one. But really romances are good for a laugh. I suggest everyone read at least one in their lives.   In romances, the heroine always gets back together with her ex-husband (or vice-versa). They always have "mind blowing" sex, get mad at each other, and then get back together with a less graphic sex scene. It's terrible predictible. Then why are you still reading them if you know what happens do you ask? Because romances always have a happy ending. In real life it's all so uncertain.   In romances, they are also adults that can fool around without having to worry about their parents being home. Sometimes I really wish my parents had normal 9-5 jobs that required them away from home. Maybe it's just the hormones talking (SHUT UP!) but grrrr! I say that with my magical powers, mom, dad, and Christopher all have to leave the house Wednesday or Friday for the afternoon. All afternoon. And not call or come home early or anything. Sigh. It won't happen. Poo on them.

      Can everyone remember those wonderful pants of a couple of weeks ago? Well guess what? I GOT THEM! We went shopping yesterday and I bought clothes. That fit me. Be proud Leah! Got those pants, and a skirt, and a tank top and a halter (woohoo!) and another top. Yea go me! Everyone should be proud of my lowcut/fitting clothes!   Went and saw "Jersey Girl" tonight. It was probably one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Really funny and even though Jennifer Lopez was in it, she died in the first 10 minutes, so it was ok. Plus, Ben Affleck was in it and that made it wonderful. Ben Affleck rates up there with Keanu Reeves. Both are totally gorgeous. I just saw movies with each of them in them, so I'm rather hooked on them. I went to the movies with Christin and afterwards, her parents treated us to ice cream. That was kinda strange going out with a friend who can't drive. Had a chocolate milkshake at 9:45, so it's like WOWWIE! The world is all happy and spinny, and it's making me type kinda slow, but think really fast. Or maybe it's the other way around. I don't really care.   I'm really glad I didn't have to go to church with my mom tonight. I hate going to church. Not that I'm against church or anything. I just dont do organized religion. I believe in a higher power and an afterlife, but excuse me for siding with Keanu Reeves in "Matrix" but I don't like thinking that there is someone knowing exactly what i'm going to do. This is all a new revalation with me. Anyways. I should be getting to bed, but i dont really feel like going since I'll just toss and turn all night from that wonderful but so horrible chocolate. I could read, but I dont know if i have any books i want to read. Oh the choices, the choices. Well, tis Easter tomorrow, so I won't be writing. No, wait. I probably will since there will most likely be some kind of drama having to do with mi familia at my grandma's. Till then...hasta luego  !Sarah!

      Those are probably my two favorite words in the english language. Except for free chocolate, or cute boy, or giving head. j/k on that last one. I guess there are a lot of words I like then. Had a whole conversation about blow jobs the other day. Ya, that was interesting. Back to Spring Break though...  Today, being the first official day of Spring Break, I slept in. Execpt I only slept till 7:15. I read for an hour or so and then got up. I've been having a bit of insomnia lately. I don't know if it's the lack of anything in my life or what, but I go to bed late, get up during the night, and am up early. Quizbowl is over, and work is boring as usual, so there is no running from place to place anymore.   Each year, before SB and summer vacation, I tell myself that this is going to be the "different" summer or break. So far, this hasn't happened. The vacations are basically the same every year. I hang out with my parents (ahhhh) and do nothing till I get back to school. Well, I'm putting my foot down! This break is going to be the good one. The one I will always remember. I'm not quite sure how I am going to accomplish this, but I will damn it.   I got my car fixed. A couple of weeks ago, I was at someone's house and I opened my car door and the wind caught it. It flung open my door, almost annihilated his car door, and bent my door. I got to pay $40 to fix it. This isn't adding in the hubcap that decided to come off while I was getting my car washed, and again when I was driving down the road. That's another $100. See my enthusiasm? I am just glad that my car is back home in it's garage. Yea!   If anyone has an idea on something to do during break, let me know. Thanks a ton...  ~Sarah!

      "OK, let's say two people, for this case-a man and a woman are doing it, and he, whatever, says he's six inches long. And for however long - twenty minutes, an hour whatever, for some period of time - six inches of ... matter, is gone, conserved." - From  Brave New Girl   I saw this quote and I had to reread it. Rather interesting I think. Kinda strange. Wutever. The reason I came up with that was because my whole post today is sex. I think it's overrated. Wow! A whole in, out five minutes tops. My health teacher is telling us that abstinence is the way to go, but I don't get that either. This may be because we live in a society where sex is basically everywhere. Abstinence, in my opinion, is just telling us to put it off for a couple of years. Does it really matter if we have sex now, as opposed to college? And what's with the whole waiting till marriage? If that's the way you chose to go, then go for it, but that still doesn't allow me any understading on it. I have to hear Kelli and Jason talk about their non-existant sex life everyday. It goes something like this. Wah wah wah, I want to have sex. Wah, wah, wah, no. But why Kel? Because Jason. Penis penis penis. Vagina vagina vagina. It gets really tiring. Then there is Mike and Jesse who are both having sex so that leaves little ol' me in the dark. That's something else to add to the "Sarah is naive" list. Today Leah compared my life to being in a styrofoam cup. Thanks Leah. I didn't think I was that sheltered. Really, I'm not. I know what happens with sex and drugs in our school. Hell, I've seen it. Drugs in school I mean. People practically have sex in school anyways. The practice rooms in the band room are forever tainted. Of course, so are some parts of the theater. And the elevator. And the roof. Yuck. Whenever I get around to having sex it sure as hell isn't going to be in school.

      Guess who is getting  another   4.0??? That's right! Me! Yes! Me! My math grade was a 91.4, but with that wonderful extra percentage paper, I'm gonna get a 94.4! That would definitely be an A! Spanish is a given A. Lit, Health and Band are A's as well. By rights, I should have an A- in drafting, but Ash doesnt give minuses, so I have an A! That's a 4.0! I am so incredibly happy! Plus Spring Break is coming up. I get to go shopping on Friday for Chicago clothes (hopefully a dress or skirt) and go shopping in general. Then Megan, Raimundo, and I are planning on seeing a movie sometime. Yea! What a great day!  Oh, this is the start of something good Don't you agree? I haven't felt like this in so many moons You know what I mean? -Gavin DeGraw  Follow Through   It's where I'm from that lets them think I'm a whore I'm an educated virgin -The Wallflowers  Sleepwalker   LISTEN TO THE WALLFLOWERS!

      My mom is an aide in a second grade classroom at Lakeland. This means she shadows a couple of the mentally challenged kidlits. Today, they were doing math assessments and one of her boys was struggling with writing a story problem. He got stuck on the word "many." After trying multiple ways of spelling it, he exclaimed, "Damnit! I can't remember how to spell many!"   Straight from the mouths of our future.  Also, we were talking about sex at our lunch table (what's new there). Someone pipes up and says, "Someone once told me 'No more sex', then we had sex." Excuse me. I need to go vomit.

      It seems that lately we have all been going through a mid-teen crisis. We are all realizing that who we are is not the person we want to be or the real us. It's kind of hard to explain. I think you have to put all the crap of being a teenager in a box somewhere and look at things from a different view. High school is only four years out of the 70 or more you are going to live. It flies by, as we all can attest to. We can't stress about the little things, even though we do it anyways. In 10 years, even in 5 years, we are all going to be different people. It won't matter how many people you dated, or kissed, or screwed. Or what classes you took. Or who your friends were. What does matter, is your perspective. Looking back at the last 2 and a half, almost 3 years, there have been things I really regret. But these things don't matter because you can't change them. When you finally get a grip on that, it feels like a weight has been lifted off your chest. Some things are in the past. What we have to look forward to, is the future. In this sense, I am looking forward to the future. I can't wait to start college. To meet new people and have new experiences. Life will past you by if you get bogged down by the harshness of reality. I read in a book once, that you see people the way you want to see them, not how they actually are. In truth, we all judge each other very harshly. We all do it. I'm guilty of it. But I am also guilty of wanting happiness. Sometimes you have to sacrifice perspective to find true happiness. I am still in a whole limbo thing with a guy. But if I look at the situation and think "is this really worth it?" I can see that it may be, but in the long run probably not. Shorthandedly, getting at all involved with him could lead to some amount of happiness. It's all so very crazy b/c he and I don't talk like we used to, so I'm not quite sure how to approach it all. According to the words above, I should take this issue and put it aside (believe me, I have tried) and look at it from someone elses point of view or from a different angle entirely. In closing, I do want to say that high school hasn't been all that bad. It's had its bad days (dating certain people) and it's had its good days (the joys of life (a good grade, a cute boy)). I am walking out of here in a year and a quarter with a smile on my face because high school didn't kill me and I have learned that life can be great if you let it.

      Megan pointed out to me the other day, that when I like someone, I bring them up in conversation too much. I was sitting here a few minutes ago talking to mi madre, and I realized I was doing it again. Except I censored myself and only thought about them. But that brought me to more troubling thoughts. Why do I like this person? Why and the hell am I attracted to him. Actually there are three hims, but that is irrelevant. Two are freshmen (damn it) and the other is a sophomore. One currently resides in another state (damn it), one flirts with me (woot!) and the other is already claimed by a friend (or two). I'm hoping that two of them are just interests. As Kelly once put it, I'm not crushing on him, I'm just interested. I guess I must wait till summer arrives to see what happens. It looks like summer is going to be a lot of fun. I can't wait.   8 more days of school!

      I came across a book today written by a man. On the cover, it showed a cowboy in the foreground and the same cowboy and a woman (scantly clothed) locked in a "passionate embrace" in the background. Naturally I had to open it up and read some. I turned to the sex scene, (see Romance entry) and started to read. It seems as though men write romance novels too. The heroine is every man's dream. A young innocent thing who has no idea what the hell is going on in his pants, and so the man must take advantage of her and educate her of course. Now, a man is not gonna go to the romance section of the library/bookstore and pick out a book. No! These male romances are cleverly disguised as " urlLink Westerns ." I must say. The sex scenes are shorter and more to the point. What usually takes four to five pages in a woman's romance, took a page or two. What is the world coming to where guys have to read porn? All the guys I know download it from the internet or buy it in stores. Whatever floats your boat I guess.  Seniors leave tomorrow. As do other persons. The world is a crazy place. Today in drafting, 3 or 4 of us stayed until the bell rang and then we realized that the bell had rung and thought that we might want to leave. Left. Tyler followed me to my locker. He is definitely a strange one. Gotta love him though.   This weekend is the party weekend. Not. My parents are gone for the whole weekend and the only guy I want to do anything with is vamosing out of here. Show how timing works against me. I'll probably end up seeing a movie or two and having Abbey or Leah or someone spend the night. We'll see.

      The Rules of the World According to Sarah (Slightly based of the Drunken Rules of Leahland)  1. Black clothing is NOT to be worn with brown shoes and vice versa. A combination of the two colors in shoes and/or clothing is only acceptable if approved by me.  2. Teachers that are hated are automatically fired.   3. Everyone must speak their mind. The truth hurts, so deal with it.  4. Friends with benefits (amigos con beneficios) is acceptable only if all the terms of the "relationship" are set up in advance. You are not allowed to make-out with someone if you have no intention of dating them or acknowledging the person as more then friends.  5. Ignoring someone important is forbidden. Anyone I deem important is and they should at least get a "hi" everyday.  6. When you have a crush on someone, you tell them. If they recipricate the feeling, then you date. If not, then get over it. On the same hand, if you like someone, then stop liking them, you have to tell them so no ackward situations can occur.  7. Dating the same person twice is strictly forbidden. Breaks are allowed, but only once and for a maximum of 30 days.   8. Parents will work set hours. If they come home early, they must place a phone call to the home first.  9. If you have a dream car, you can buy it with money from the government. Silver Spider Eclipses are preferred.  10. I am the supreme ruler. Any changes to these rules must go through me.   Excuse me while I take over and bring all the hot guys into my house. These include the decided boys of Sarah and Abbey's perfect world. I call Chad Michael Murray, Keanu Reeves, J (Hidalgo), Shawn Ashmore, Robert Schwartzman, Rider Strong, Joaquin Phoenix, and Jesse Bradford. If any of you are reading this right now....come over. Yay! Boys!

      My dad got really mad at me when I first installed aim because I also had msn installed. Many months later, he reinstalls it. What did I miss here? My parents never cease to amaze me.   As a continuation of yesterday, I realized some more things. The first of which is that I am a bitchy bitter person because of the people I am friends with. The guys at the table in the morning are so mean, that it rubs off on me and has become second nature to me. A day doesn't go by when I look at someone and find their flaws before I see what they are good for. Definitely need to break out of that chain.  Secondly, and at the moment lastly, I noticed how much I say "My mom...". As in "My mom would freak out if I did that." or "My mom won't let me." This is a reasonable excuse in some cases since she does require me to tell her where I'm going and then she has to decide if I actually get to go, but it's awful of me. I don't want to be this way. I want to be able to make decisions by myself. Recently, I have been ignoring her on quite a few rules she has set for me. Like going to a guys house when his parents aren't home. Or parking with a guy. Personally, these are small victories in my mind, but they aren't gonna help me. Now I'm just bitching, so I should stop.   Must do homework for a half hour or I have to do it in the car to Detroit. We're seeing Lion King on stage for my mom's birthday. Woopie.

      I have become one of the people I really hate in life. I am one of the people who tell others about their private life. I think I want to tell because of an unconcious thought process of people calling me prude. If I can prove to them that I'm actually doing things, then that wouldn't make them think that. But that's not really it. My other reason for wanting to tell is that it makes it real. If I am the only person who knows what is happenening, other then the guy, then it's just us knowing and ya. I guess it's hard to explain.   Walked at Relay For Life this afternoon since it was cancelled due to storms last night. My dad is coming home soon. Blah. I have a shitload of homework and I don't have any time to do it tomorrow since I'm going to see a play in the evening. Great, the week seems packed already. Band concerts, work, seniors leaving. Tear for that. Among other things. We'll see I guess.

      Today was such an awesome day! 6th hour only had 6 people in it. We could hear it raining, so we looked out the windows and saw that the sky was a nice shade of blackish green. Soon after that, Darga came on and told us to go to the tornado rooms. The drafting kids congregated into the back of the class where we hung out for ages....until 2:35 when they released us. That was fun though.   I gave Megan a ride home as well as a boy who so geniusly locked his keys in his car. Thanks Megan for being wonderful and sitting in the backseat. Anyways, took the opportunity to break in my car. Ok, break-in in my terms is just kissing or really anything having to do with a boy in my car. Go me! Didn't get home 'til 3:30ish. Mmmm, I love boys.   Ha ha. My brother didn't have school today. Now he has to make it up.  Ok. Gotta go back to my marijuana in the living room. Hasta!

      Half day was pretty cool. Lunch was tasty. Who would have thought to put ham, bacon, pepperoni, green peppers, and extra cheese on a pizza? Mmmm delicioso.  Some people wrote some very nice things in my yearbook. Of course, no one will beat out Jackson from last year. That one made me cry. Today was basically a blowoff day since we worked in health, signed yearbooks in band, and sat around and bs'd in drafting. That was fun.   Was having a really great day, but then something happened to make it go pthzzzt down the toilet. Not gonna talk about that. I was kinda upset, so when I went to meet Matt and Megan, I asked Megan if she had something I could throw. She let me throw her keys. I threw them twice and on that second throw, I kinda broke them. Oops. Now she has a seperate ingnition key. Was feeling horrible and Jesse came around, saw me looking sad, and gave me a hug. Yay hugs. Made me feel better. Random hugs for Sarah make the world a better place. 'Cept then he teased me about getting laid. Blah to Jesse and getting laid. So now, I get to vent to Jesse about being a bitch and stupid stuff tomorrow at lunch. WooHoo.   I just don't know wut to do anymore. I give up. Uncle! No more fucking with Sarah's mind. Her body maybe....j/k...

      The computers have a virus! The computers have a virus! Who has to finish her drafting exam? Not me! Woohoo! We played cards today in 6th hr. What a blast. I totally sucked it up at euchre. Most of the guys were sitting around telling racist jokes which were truely horrible, but absolutely hilarious. Should definitely join them manana.  Worked today. That was a fun. Not. MA had been in this morning, so the load was wonderfully light and I got to do stupid work like throw away newspapers and look for books. Fun stuff.   Tomorrow is a half day! Megan, Raimundo, Matt (Megan's current love interest), Maryanne, and I are going out to lunch and ice cream. Yay for pizza and ice cream! We also get yearbooks tomorrow! I'm kinda bummed about that tho since it means the year is coming to a close and this year has been the absolute greatest.   The story of the day comes from lunch. Jesse and I were being stupid and Jason looks from me to Jesse a couple of times. Then he goes "You two are going to fuck." Thank you Jason.   The other sad part of the day is just always the sad part of my day. When that person who I have been writing about for months doesn't flirt or anything with me. Tear. I guess I will just have to learn to live with it. I'm tired of being angry about it. I've moved on to "just happy it happened to me with you."

      Today I found out many things...  Raimundo should die. Megan has been coming up with ways of killing him. My favorite is letting Diego sit on him.  Even though I haven't forgiven Jesse for kissing Devon when she was dating Andy, he is still a pretty cool guy.  When Freshmen visits the library, time stops and the world tends to revolve around him.  Drafting sucks. I don't want to finish my exam. When the seniors and Josh leave, we'll have 5 people in the class.  Memorial Day weekend plans include Megan spending the night Saturday night. If anyone wants to hang out, give me a buzz.  The library is closing the week of exams. I still get payed for not working.   My dad is leaving Friday! YAY!   Relay For Life is this weekend. Blah.  Give me a few more minutes and I'll have some more.

      Quick heads up to those of you naive enough to think this. Normally when you are dating someone, you let that person know that you're dating them. I AM NOT DATING DANNY. What do you think I am, stupid? I learned the last time that Freshmen are bad things. So, if anyone else has heard these things, ignore them. I don't want to date him, I am not dating him, and I never will date him. And to Danny, friends are all that's gonna happen. Sorry.   Thanks to Matt in 6th hour who gave me the heads up on it.

      It turns out that the parental mistrust is all from my dad. He doesn't trust me alone in the house. He has no reason not to. I'm still the good child. Pretty much. Lately has been a little less perfect, but anyways. The two jobs thing was his idea too. What and the hell!?!?!?!?!

      I honestly can't remember Friday. Hmmm, that's sad. Anyways, Saturday was a work day then a crazy mess of phone calls from Megan and Danny trying to figure out if we were going to hang out. Turns out we didn't b/c Megan had to go watch the acting finals for credit in Drama. So Abbey and I went to the movies instead. That was fun. We saw  urlLink "Mean Girls."  Was pretty good actually. We saw the preview for the new Cinderella movie that has Chad Michael Murray in it. Hell, I will see the movie just for him. Screw Hilary Duff. CMM is my new hero. Although Keanu Reeves is still hanging in there.   This morning at 10:30, while I am cooking my breakfast, my mom tells me she wants me to get a summer job. Working at the library is an okay job, she says, but I need money for college. Where did this come from? Since when is college money that big of a deal? I like working the same hours. It leaves me time to be doing other things this summer. She wants me to work the off days of the library. And she also wants me to do this work thing all day long. Do you know how much this sucks? I am happy at the library. ARRRRGHHH!!! Also, she tells me that my dad doesn't like the idea of leaving me home alone over the Memorial Day weekend. My parents and brother are leaving Friday night and coming back Monday. (I think) Apparently I am not old enough or something to be by myself for 2 or 3 days. It's not like I'm gonna have a party or something. I'm not stupid. Besides, I work one of those days anyways. I'll probably have a friend spend the night one or two of the nights. Hey! So everyone! Party at Sarah's house over Memorial Day weekend. I guess they don't trust me or something. (Of course, I have been lying to them a little too much lately.) It's so frusterating! It's nice that Mom lets me wake up properly before she springs all this on me.

      Wow. I have proven today that blondes really are stupid. In 6th hr, we had a sub. Nothing new there, we always have subs. Anyways, we're sitting there and the blond in the class, Ashley is trying to figure out the title of a song. She wouldn't sing any of it, so we couldn't help her out. Anyways, Rob says something about "Meant to Live." Ashley asks him to sing a bar or two, so Rob says "We were meant to live for so much more..." Ashley tweeks out b/c this is the song she had been looking for for the last 20 minutes. The blond part is coming up. About five minutes later, Ashley goes "So what else does Switchplate sing?" We all looked at her like she was the stupidest thing and four or five people at the same time said "It's Switchfoot stupid." Very funny. She isn't all that smart. Pretty annoying actually. I feel bad for Pat sometimes because whenever she needs help, she says in this horribly whiny voice "Paatrrickk." Anyways, I need to get off the cpu b/c it is very windy and rainy. I'll write more later since this weekend will probably turn out to be another interesting one for very different reasons.  ~Sarah

      I'm sorry to everyone if I have been bitchy. I honestly have no idea why I've been like this this week. I'm looking forward to the weekend since Meg, Danny, Diego and I are going to the movies. I have to make something in my weekend good.   I am so tired of life in general. It's so repetitive that it makes me want to scream. I do want to apologize for my blog yesterday. It makes me look really horrible, but I have nowhere else to write about it. It also makes me sad because the since Saturday, things have been going down the shit-hole with Hidalgo. (yup, back to secret Megan names) I don't know wut to think anymore so I'm in that nice long process of getting over him. Which is so not gonna work. Especially when he is sitting there and okay, no! I am not going into this again. Here's the lowdown in simple terms:  I like him. He said he likes me but I'm beginning to wonder about that. Saturday was grand. Life sucks now.   Excuse me, I need to go drown in books and chocolate. Thank God tomorrow is Friday.

      "Two people can be perfect for each other but if the timing's wrong its never going to work out. Bad timing is the reason that most normal people end up single. Weirdos and creeps are single cos they are weird and creepy but people like us are single because of bad timing." -Love & Sex  Here comes the bitching now. I like this guy. Big deal right? Everyone likes a guy sometime in their life. But this one is different. I have been lusting after him for more time then I care to tell here. He is so much better then my ex. Of course, pretty much anything is better then my ex. The point I am trying to get across here is that this guy and I really hit it off the other day. (see entries from the weekend) Had fun. Let's do it again kind of thing. Then, yesterday and today, I hear not so good things. Not so good for me that is. It seems as though this guy also likes this other girl. Now, I have no way of asking him whether he likes her and wants her because then I will feel like a jealous bitch. Even though, if you haven't noticed, I am a jealous bitch at the moment. Also the other day, I used a friend to get him to tell me if he was ever going to ask me out. That was a definite no. So, does this mean, no forever? No now? No because I want the other chic? What's wrong with this picture? It all makes me so confused.  My other problem (which is pointed out to me at each family event) is that I haven't had a boyfriend this year. Gasp! Why is this a big deal? This year has been the best one yet. I broke up with a complete idiot and made out with someone so much better. If this pattern of good years keeps going, hell, next year is gonna rock. That wasn't the point of this bit though. Is there something wrong with me? Is there something that makes people say "No! She is not dateable."? Is there an invisible sign that says only younger guys can look at me? And then you can't date me, you can only mess with my head? I am sick of it all. I want a boyfriend. I liked having a connection with someone this weekend. And I want that. He is the first person to make me feel this way since dipshit. Yes, I did like the ex at one point. Hell, I dated him for way too long. Anyways, I don't know what to do except wait it out. I don't have much time though since I won't see him all summer. After the weekend, he mentioned something about doing the whole thing again. So what about the other chic? Has he kissed her too? I need to stop thinking these things. I have no idea what to do. If life were easy, I could just say...."Get over him" to myself and I would be. Here it goes! I'm over him.   Fuck. No I'm not. Just shoot me now. My life sucks.

      Today is a day of all days where the hotness of the world decided to show up on my doorstep. Okay, maybe it wasn't my doorstep, more of my mailbox. The magically delicious Dave decided to send an invite to his graduation party to us. This included a senior picture. That glorious picture is now sitting on my desk to be put onto my bulletin board with the rest of the guys I lust after.   The other incredible thing that happened to me was at work. Yes, I work at the library, but it can really pay off sometimes. One of the women I work with (Genie) has a son. Her son is 17 years old and a senior at Gabriel Richard. (sp?) Whenever Genie is doing knitting in the back, Garrett comes in and does homework. Garrett and Dave are the eye candy of my life. They have drool inducing capabilities. If I were a little more whorish, I would jump one of them.   In case I didn't say, this weekend totally kicked ass. I can't really go into details due to a promise I made, but it was definitely a first on a lot of things. Yay! Go me! Now, if I can only get it to happen again.

      Sometimes, I wish that I was the weather You'd bring me up in conversation forever And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day  Oh, sometimes I wish that I was a cold beer I'd rest assured that you would hold me near I'd be guaranteed to be just what you need  And there could be no other way, 'cause you're so, you're so lame Your tired words are all, they're all the same Yeah I would walk and I'd surely walk away If I wasn't such a sucker for you  Sometimes, I wish that I was a bong hit You'd let me in and you would love every minute And tell the room the things I did to you...  Oh and there could be no other way, 'cause you're so lame Your tired words are all, your tired words are all the same Yeah I would walk you know I'd surely walk away If I wasn't such a sucker for you  I see your world with rosey-colored glasses on Wanna right what I see wrong I could never have that power over you  Someday, I'm gonna pack up and leave this town  I'm gonna get my own things goin' on And when I do, I'll forget I'll forget I'll forget about how, how you're so, you're so lame Your tired words are all, your tired words are all the same And I would walk you know I'd, I'd walk away  If I wasn't such a sucker for you I wasn't such a sucker for you  I wasn't such a sucker for you

       Bad Words  Weeks ago I said a bad word that echoed in my house. My mom dropped the dishes, my dad was terror struck,  my sister was just standing there,  it looked like she was stuck. Just because I said that work, it sounded just like …….

      I had a really horrible day today. In essence, it was a good day since I really didn't do anything. But it just turned out to be really shitty. So shitty in fact, that I cried in 6th hour. Only one person noticed though. She pointed it out and turned some heads. It's amazing how fast someones head can turn. We had an assembly 1st hour. It was really sad. A guy came in who had lost his son to a drunk driving accident. Very tearful. 2nd hour was fiesta! Watched a movie and all that stuff. Then Pittaway's class where we wrote something about Bob, Joe and Sarah the prostitute. Health was just boring as was band. I had nothing to do in drafting since I got all my drawings in and mounted. I should have started my exam, but I looked at the packet of info and at that moment I just zoned out. You could have yelled in my ear and I wouldn't have heard you. That was probably the moment I started crying.   On the bright side, Abbey still likes a boy. Hereon known as Miguel, since I'm not supposed to release his name. She comes in and tells me if she saw him or talked to me and it just lights up her face. It's adorable. I'm so happy that Abbey has found someone. It's about time. : )  Sarah and DQ are hitting the movies sometime. That's awesome too since I've known that she liked him for ages. At least someone has the guts to ask a guy on a date.  Kim and Wes are still together. Those two bring happiness to the world. It's so cute. Okay, I'm done analyzing other peoples relationships.  As for me and any relationships I have with a guy, he says he likes me and that's where we are. Simple as that.  I have Music Man tonight (o boy) and work and Music Man tomorrow night. We'll see what happens.

      I was getting the jeans out of my closet today when I happened to look up and see some pictures on my desk and on my bulletin board. A lot of people have moved away since middle school and I miss them more then even I realize. Take for instance the following people...  Ryan Daly- Moved away in the 8th grade. We had known each other forever since he went to my Mom's daycare. I guess he's all grown up now being 6'2" and all. He moved to Florida with his mom and we haven't managed to coordinate our schedules to see each other when he's up here.  Katrina Strich- Some of my favorite memories are of going to Katie's house before the middle school dances and getting ready. We thought we were so cool since we could walk home and because we had guys to hang out with. That was Mike and Aj. Can you see the fault in our thinking? lol. Anyways, she was really a pretty cool person. She introduced me to chat rooms and Luka. omg. Luka. Can never forget Luka. That's a whole nother story.  Zach Smith- Met him in Jazz Band in 8th grade. He was interesting. I used to have the biggest crush on him. Looking back on that one it seems strange since Taryn dated him. Wait...Taryn has liked or dated most of the guys I have liked or dated. Arrgh. 'Cept the latest as far as I know. This little blurb is not about Taryn. He moved away last year I think to Hartland. Josh says he moved to Howell. Hmmm, he would know I guess since they're (or were) friends. Anyways. Ya. We'll leave that one alone now.  Okay. Maybe I don't have anyone else. Just taking a quick trip down Memory Lane. Here is where you refer to the article from April 28th on the good days of life. I'm tired of writing and I smell food. Corn on the cob and ribs for dinner tonight. Mmmmm  ~Sarah~

      I took an almost four hour bath today. It was absolutely wonderful. While I was reading, I realized that today is May 2nd. Memorial Day is right around the corner, as is the end of school. Pretty soon the seniors will be leaving taking with them memories we have all forged since our freshmen days. That led me to think about summer. With a driver's license and relatively more freedom, I am kinda looking forward to it. It might not be "that" summer, but it should be pretty good.   Last night I was sitting on the computer. Aren't I always? I was having a rather interesting conversation and the power went out. That was a bit frusterating. Blah to the weather. That conversation was leading to interesting places. Oh well. There are always more opportunities for them. I then saw how much I depend on lights in my house. When I shut off all the switches in the office, I had to venture down the hallway. Usually the bathroom nightlight gives enough of a glow to get from the office to the bathroom. With no light and no moon to go by, it was pitch black. I was groping around in the dark and the lights came back on. So I went to the office to actually shut down the computer. I got my contacts out, no wait, I dropped one on the floor, so I pitched them both. Went to bed where I read for a good 10 minutes before the power went back out. I was in the good part of my book.   Stupid Danny didn't call me today which means we have to find another time to watch the chupacabra movie. This week is almost shot since I work Tues. and Thurs. I've got tutoring tomorrow, which hopefully I can get out of, but then I have to go shopping for a mother's day present. Friday is the play again, as is Saturday. Work is also Saturday. Blah to work. Hmmm, I'm vegging on Wednesday. Damn it. We have MEAP again. This sucks. O well. I had fun this weekend.

      Had "Music Man" twice today. That was totally nuts. At 4:00, we waited for 10 minutes before we went on. Then at 9:00 we waited for over an hour to go on. We played strip blackjack. That was kinda fun I guess. Don't mind stripping since my shirt showed everything anyways.   Feeling bad for my buddy Andy. Because of that whole Jesse/Devon/Andy thing, he is out a girlfriend even though he still likes her. Tear for Andy. But...."My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard..." (lol Andy)  Played strip blackjack. Sorry, but I  do not   care to see Max's scrawny body anymore then the next person, so keep your shirt on. I did pretty good actually. Still had on my top, pants, boxers, and wonderful black tinkerbell underwear. Laugh at me here. I love those things. Yay for strip blackjack. Wait. It was my idea to play. Blackjack I mean, since I really suck at poker. Besides, blackjack goes much faster.  Details on that wonderful car accident I was in. I was coming home from Frieda's (thanks for takin' me there Leah!) and I got just past the firestation and a lady in the middle lane decided to turn into me because "the coast was clear." I'm in a fucking car coming up from behind you damn it! How could you not see me? I'm in a fucking blue car. Arr. So we sat in our cars for a few minutes while I called my dad and the passenger of the other car called the cops. By this point I was in tears. I was shaking really bad too. Two cops showed up and we all got out of our smashed cars. They took down all the information for us and by this time my aunt had driven by and stopped. My grandpa had also driven uptown b/c my dad was still 15 minutes away. They were both patting me on the back and comforting me (thanks guys) and I my grandpa took me back to his house were my dad picked me up. We went to the place where they took my car and the garage man put on a new tire and I got to drive my baby home. I have to get the whole drivers side fixed though and that's gonna be a nice sum of money. Can't wait especially since I just got my door fixed from two months ago. Very sad. It runs and I'm okay. The old lady and her daughter are okay as well.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow since Danny is supposed to give me a buzz so we can all assemble at his casa to view the Chupacabra movie. WooHoo fun. I should go to bed. Oh! I have new library books. I won't be sleeping for a while. Adieu!  Sarah

      Went to the zoo today. It would have been a lot more fun except my three cousins and aunt were there. I don't mind Madison (cousin #1), but the other two got on my nerves five minutes after we left. Between the hitting me, kicking me, yelling at me and the general stupidity of them, I had to haul off and smack them. I did hit Austin since he was being the worst. I don't know how my aunt and uncle can stand it. My aunt even had the nerve to ask me if I was always this grouchy. "Yes, damn it. I'm this pissy 24/7 especially when your bratty children are being shitty!"

      Just got back from up-north and lo and behold, there is no special letter in my mailbox. The best I had was $500 from the lady who hit my car. Woohoo! Now I can maybe get it fixed before school starts. I definitely had fun checking out the boys of Indian River. First the one at the Inn with the longish blond hair and the nice body, and then the dark haired wonder at the Dairy Mart. Woohoo for boys who check me out. Of course, it's Indian River, who else are they going to look at. It's not like it's filled with good looking chicas.   The whole up-north experience was rather boring. It was a 4 hour drive up there, just so I could read books and sit around in my bathing suit. Nothing I couldn't do here. The best part was the boys. Mmm, boys. I also amused mi familia with my teeth. They squeak and it's really funny.   I was buzzing around the internet and came across  urlLink this . Much hilarity. Gotta love the Germans.

      It seems as we grow up, our parents trust us with more information. Just the other day, I learned that my grandma only went to school through the 8th grade. When I asked about it, my aunts and my mom said it was because my grandma had seizures a lot. They remember when she would just zone out for days at a time. Now, she is on medication, so she doesn't have them anymore. No one told me this. No one told me about my abusive great-uncle Bernie either.   I decided to read  A Prayer for Owen Meany . I also have to go back into Brighton to pick up  The Power of One.   I am about halfway through  Snow Falling on Cedars . It's really surprising me. It's actually a pretty good book. I had been meaning to read it for a while, and the AP list just spurred on the idea of reading it.   Mi madre is already planning my graduation party. What is wrong with this? Except that it's not for another year. It's the same year as my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary. Which reminds me. If anyone knows how to mess around with music (cutting, editing, etc...) will you let me know? I'm putting together a c.d. with pictures and music and I'm not quite sure how to do that kind of stuff. Also, I am not sure if I have the software or whatever I need to do this project with.   Summer is going okay. Just today I sat out for a good hour or more reading. I was multitasking since I had my bathing suit on and I was soaking up the rays and reading AP books. Mmmm, reading. Haven't hung out with anyone. Blah. I keep seeing other people's blogs and how they're hanging out with everyone and stuff. Blah to them. No. Not really. Like I said, summer is going okay. Nothing horrible has happened, but nothing spectacular has happened.   We're going up-north this weekend. We should definitely go to the Inn-Between. Hot boy from last summer is there. Maybe he'll be the hot boy of this summer too. I can only wish. Since I am such a great chicken shit, I can see it now. I'll just sit there and do nothing. Just observe the hotness of the world while he works. No social interaction at all. If only, if only.

      I am buying books tomorrow. Real books. The kind that I get to keep at my house. Oooo. I haven't purchased a book in ages. I always check them out at the library. I'm off to buy my AP books. I'm going to Little Professor since they are in desperate need of financial type things. They are closing and that makes me terribly sad. For the last 7 or 8 years, I've been going there faithfully every 4 weeks. The place we get our hair cut is next door, so after my hairs are cut, I go to the bookstore. When Little Professor closes, I will be forced to find another bookstore. Borders is hell. I hate their selection of juvenile fiction. It's all chic dribble. I read that kind of stuff to a point. Then I want to go dye my hair blond and screw someone over. Ya. Go figure. Anyways, my summer AP reading list is: -The Power of One -Snow Falling On Cedars -The Secret History -Crime and Punishment -The Scarlet Letter -A Prayer for Owen Meany or Slaughter House Five  These are on top of the other books I plan on reading: -Cider House Rules -Peter Pan -Neverending Story -The Great Gatsby -Alice In Wonderland or Through the Looking Glass -The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and/or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  Mmmm, I can't wait. O! And if anyone has suggestions on what else I should read, go head and tell me.

      The main perk of working at the library is getting books early. For example, the book I have right now isn't released in bookstores until Tuesday. But it is on my table waiting to be returned. I finished it this afternoon and I can't wait for next summer when the 11th one comes out. These Janet Evanovich books are hilarious. I love them to death. Even though they are basically mindless reading to what I usually read, they are great. Okay. I must go off and do a bunch of other stuff....  Hasta Maria

Going off to read some books. Mmm, books.

      Is it a bad thing that I wish my dad got sucked up in a tornado and never came back? I can't stand him. Arrrgh.   The people who have lived across the street from me for the last 17 years or more, have moved out. It's a very sad thing. Except Sean is the principal at my mom's school, so I'll be seeing her. Her son, Nick, is the best thing to look at in the neighborhood. Mmmm. Anyways, we met the couple who are moving in. Ya, it's just a couple. No teenage sons or anything. Damn.   My happy workless but still getting paid week is over. I have to go back to work on Tuesday. I have to work Friday as well. But that's fun. I get to put whipped cream on all the kidlits ice cream. And I see some of my friends. Yay! Everyone is coming home this weekend. My aunt, uncle and cousins from Georgia and my uncle from Mexico. Should be interesting.   I also have to go up north with my parents next weekend. Not looking forward to that at all. Summer really is looking up. Not.

      Took my ACT's today. Those totally sucked. Then I went to A&W with Aj, Bob, Jason, and Chris. That was interesting. I had to sit in the back seat with Chris and Jason...who are very tall. No space wutsoever. Not to mention the taking of the fries for "fat tax" or "car tax." I didn't mind though. It was fun.   Turns out that C+ I got on the trig exam was my grade plus 10%. For the first time in my life I got a D+ on an exam. That kinda bums me out. But...It's summer! It's gonna be so much fun I can't wait for it all to get started.   My dad is out of town again! Chic flicks at my house!

      We've been taking exams since yesterday. I thought I had gotten at least a B on my trig exam, but when I went to check out grades today, I had a C+. This sucks. It makes my overall grade an A- which lowers my GPA to at least a 3.9. This sucks so much! I am beginning to doubt if I did well on my other exams now. Blah. No exams tomorrow.  I went and saw  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  today. It was really cool, but pretty long. Yay Harry Potter.  I realized the other day that I haven't talked to a certain someone in almost two weeks. That makes me sad. Of course it's also kinda sad that we had whole conversations about blowjobs. Must talk to him and make the world a better place. I love mail!

      I was doing perfectly fine going from class to class without thinking about a person. Then I come home and my mom has to start talking about him. Damn it. It's bad enough that I still look for him when I go to lunch and when I walk in to some of my classes. Now I have to hear about it at home. I don't even know how it's going with him anymore anyways. I should definitely get ahold of him. Ya. When I get all my shit together.  We had recovered drug addicts in to speak to my health class today. One turned out to be a girl in my Vocab/Essay class last semester who I became friends with. It's amazing how you see people in a different light sometimes.  I have loads of homework and projects to do by the end of the year. Which, by the way, is next Thursday.   Had a quizbowl party type thing today. Got a metal for my imaginary letter jacket and a certificate. Afterwards, Sarah, Kyle and I went for McDonald's. This shows how boring Pinckney is. All we've got are drugs, sex and McDonald's.   I'm thinking that sleep could really improve my motivation. Mmmm, sounds good. Must go take shower and keep reading  My Antonia . Woopie.

      I have decided that the library really isn't a bad place to work. Any guys that come in are going to be semi-literate. Hell, some are even hot. I've got my fingers crossed that it's a good summer.  It's that time again where I've got lots of new quotes. I must write them down so everyone can laugh uproaringly. (not)   Health Quotes:  "Good luck trying to pee with one of those in the way." -Ken "It's just a race to get laid." -Nick "If you're going to do it, you might as well get paid for it." -Karen   Megan Quotes:  "Raimundo! Come get it off!" "I think my clothes should be off." "How do you spell orgy?" "We keep them around for entertainment like we keep some around for temptation."   Everyone else:  "If a dream is a wish your heart makes, does that mean my heart is really horny?" "My penis is the size of a goat." -Raimundo "Abbey and Kendra is in the back." -Pittaway "DJM...Dan Jerks-off on Mondays...and Tuesdays...and Wednesdays, and by Diego and in 2nd hour..."-Megan "You good at road head?" -Josh "You one armed bastard!" -Jackson "Please remove your hand from my rodilla." -Raimundo "Your chupacabra can go straight to hell!" -Heather "Penguin + taco = string!" - Raimundo "Because absence makes the heart not want to have hardcore sex." -Caitlin "I didn't know fish were holy." -Margarita "Ew! I feel queer!" -Raimundo "Math is important. Why? I don't know, but it is." -Pittaway "So how'd it go? 'I'm horny, you're horny, let's go make out?'" -Leah "Bottle rockets are the queer cousins of the firework family." "It was nice doing you in the car." -Abbey "What the hell am I smoking?" -Abbey   From everything else:  "I've never had a Cuban anything." -Dance With Me Above all else, protect your heart for it is the wellspring of life. -Proverbs 4:23 "Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or silly action for no other reason than because he knows he should not?" -Poe "It's a bra, with little sprinkly things." -Selena "I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans." - Thoreau

      Got back from upnorth two hours ago. Thank God. I couldn't stand it any longer.  Will write more about that tomorrow when I have more time. I think the cpu has a virus on it. Hopefully Dad can fix it when he gets home tomorrow. Otherwise I am not going to have e-mail or blog or AIM capabilities. That would majorly suck.  I ran into my pal Nate earlier when I went for a pasty at Checkerboard and I've decided that any guy who decides to become "goth", shouldn't. It's not a good look. Black fades and looks like shit after a few times in the wash and overall, it's not very attractive. This guy  all of a sudden decided to pull out the black clothes, long hair (which can be a good thing for some guys), chain in the pocket look and he's just  way  too cute to be doing it. Don't get me wrong. Some guys can pull it off and look really good that way, but here's some advise, goth is a no, so don't try it.

      Everyone should read this entry in  urlLink Kelli's &nbsp;blog. So very true.  I am going up north again this weekend. The vacation is gonna stretch for a little longer then three days though. I'll be gone until Friday. Then I get the house to myself for the day until mis parentes y mi hermano come back. Tear. Of course, we all must keep in mind the Labor Day (formerly the Memorial Day) yayness. When my parents go up north over Labor Day to close up the cabin and I get to go up there later in the week. This leads to Sarah having the house to herself again. Party! Not.   Am hoping for some good ole boy stuff in the Indian River place. Maybe another sighting of the ever so good looking dark haired ice cream boy. Maybe I'll finally have the guts to go talk to him. INSERT LAUGH HERE. O well. The month is almost over which means...  Band Camp is coming! Yay! It's only a month away and I can't wait for it. Plus August just kicks ass anyways. Must go finish packing and try to fit one more book in my bag. I think eight might last me through the week.  Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. *&^%$#. Who's new baby will soon cause quite a stir in our carefully organized world. Their real name coming soon when they let the rest of the world know. Till then!  Adieu!

      ROGERSVILLE, Tenn. - The party’s over for four inmates accused of going on a beer run after the jail’s doors were accidentally left unlocked.  The men were charged Monday with escape and bringing alcohol into a jail.  The breakout occurred Thursday night after cellblock doors at the Hawkins County Jail were left unlocked and a faulty control panel failed to alert jailers, Sheriff Warren Rimer said.  Two of the inmates walked out through a fire exit, leaving the door propped open with a Bible, and made a hole in the exercise yard fence. They walked to a market, bought some beer and returned to the jail to share it with other prisoners. When the booze ran out, the other two inmates made another beer run to a different store.  Authorities believe the inmates bought more than two cases of beer in all.  “I guess they thought if they came back they wouldn’t be charged with escape,” Rimer said, “but they were wrong.”  The store visits did not raise alarm because the inmates were wearing street clothes borrowed from other prisoners. The crowded jail does not have enough orange jumpsuits to go around.

       I just finished watching an episode of "Outback Jack." If you ever need major entertainment, tune it. It was hilarious. The remaining four girls took semi-delicious Jack into the city. Everyone got pampered, but the best part was Jack tweeking out and saying bloody this and bloody that. These girls were enjoying having a seaweed rub. Why do you want seaweed rubbed on you? I can understand the massage. Hell, I wouldn't mind one of those right now. Anyways, after yelling at the TV for about an hour about how the girls were sluts and Jack was a whore, my dad turned it off. Bastard. I won't even go into the assholeness of my dad lately. Then I read Leah's lj and found this, so I decided to do it.  &nbsp;  Choose a band/artist and answer only in song TITLES by that band:: John Mayer  Are you male or female:: Daughters  Describe yourself:: My Stupid Mouth  How do some people feel about you:: Your Body Is A Wonderland  How do you feel about yourself:: Something's Missing  Describe your current girlfriend/boyfriend:: Love Song For No One  Describe where you want to be::Home Life  Describe what you want to be::Bigger Then My Body  Describe how you live::Come Back To Bed  Describe how you love::Comfortable  Share a few words of wisdom: No Such Thing     &nbsp;   Hey, that was kinda fun.

        Haven't really done much lately. I did get my raise, so I am making $7.50. I love this job. It kicks ass. I went and&nbsp;saw "A Cinderella Story" on Saturday. About&nbsp;halfway through&nbsp;it, Abbey leans over and&nbsp;asks me if that is rain that we can hear. Yes, it was rain. Yes, she&nbsp;left&nbsp;the window open in&nbsp;my car.&nbsp;Two inches or so lets a shit load of rain in. We came out of the&nbsp;theater and we realized we forgot where I parked. My car doesn't really stand out, so it took some time. There we were running around in the pouring rain looking for my stupid car and getting soaked. It&nbsp;really was&nbsp;kinda fun.  &nbsp;  During the&nbsp;movie though, Abbey was making fun of me because I am such a sap for these stupid little romances. I have to be though. Come&nbsp;on. In real life is the head football guy gonna throw away&nbsp;his chances for playing college ball to run into the bleachers to kiss me? No. Is the one boy you want going&nbsp;to be the best guy friend you&nbsp;have&nbsp;hung out with your entire life? No. Is&nbsp;Spiderman gonna come down, take off his shirt, and kiss me? Hell no. Do you see a pattern?&nbsp;I guess it's kinda like romance books. You know the movie will always have a happy ending. Life is nothing like this. You&nbsp;will not always get the guy. You will not always find the strength to break out of a shitty relationship and you will not find&nbsp;the guy you are going to spend the rest of your life with in high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;     In Recent News...     John Mayer  &nbsp;really needs his own reality show, 'cause he sounds like a whole lot more fun than, say, Ashlee Simpson. Turns out the guy who hit it big singing "Your Body Is a Wonderland" has a weakness for disembodied romance. In the August issue of Esquire, he reveals the contents of his American Express bill, including $1,500 in phone sex charges. In the self-penned piece, which he dubs "The Not-So-Fabulous Life of John Mayer," the crooner also spills on how he shelled out&nbsp; $1,719.15 for a mint condition Boba Fett "Star Wars" action figure on eBay ("I do not collect action figures," he adds) and nearly $5,000 for two Louis Vuitton suits he doubts he'll ever wear. Explains the singer, "I've worn the same jeans every day since March." Say it with us: Ew.    - urlLink MSN

        ooo. Blogs are getting fancy.  Fonts   and   colors   and     stuff.  &nbsp;  Someone called me earlier. I don't know who it was. I thought it was Abbey, but she says it wasn't. Now I want to know who called me.

      It's in my head and it won't come out.  Anyways, on my way home from work this evening, I had an epiphany. I was coming up over the big hill (everyone should know about the big hill coming from Lakeland) and I realized that I don't need him. Him being a boy who only a handful of people know about. I'm living here without any correspondence from him and I'm doing fine. Sure, maybe I'm slightly more sexually frusterated then I was during the month of May, but all in all, I'm doing okay. Thinking about it later, I came to the conclusion that if he comes around feeling like he did at the end of the year, then great for me! If he comes back and is being a total douche, then fuck him. I'll get over it. I may need a pint of chocolate ice cream and a good movie, but I'll live. It makes me sad to think about this, but my stomach is currently doing flip flops because tomorrow are the dreaded senior pictures.   The best part of senior pictures is my new clothes. Woo! Sarah got new, low-cut shirts!!! I am very excited. Now, if only I could burn the evil black bra and get a new one. I am cursed in that way. Bra's can kiss my ass if they ever think I'm going to wear them. Arrgh. The only thing they're good for is running around and being taken off.  I am off to bed so I can look decent for the pictures tomorrow. If I die from ulcers or something before then, you will all know why.

Just make this go away Just one more peaceful day!  And it's been awhile Since I could look at myself straight And it's been awhile Since I said I'm sorry And it's been awhile Since I've seen the way the candle lights your face And it's been awhile But I can still remember just the way you taste  And everything I can't remember As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me I cannot blame this on my father He did the best he could for me  And it's been awhile Since I could hold my head up high And it's been awhile Since I said I'm sorry

      My mom asked me the other day if I was nervous about getting my senior pictures done. I answered no, but I realized that I am actually nervous about a ton of stuff. When someone asks me if I am nervous, I always reply in the negative. It may be that I want to appear more self-assured then I truely am, or maybe it's a nervous habit. In some cases, I have nothing to be nervous about, whereas getting my pictures taken really does make me kinda nervous. I'm not a big fan of someone taking multiple pictures of me. I can handle it with other people, but pictures of me exclusively suck. So, next time you ask me if I'm nervous, I probably am, but I'll say no.   At the waterpark Wednesday, I overheard a guy talking to his two male friends about nipple size. When the hell did it start to matter what size your nipples are? I mean, this is something you have absolutley no control over. I'm not sure if he was talking about male nipple size, or female, but either way. I'm thinking that it was male nipples since anyone can see them when guys run around with no shirt on. (mmm in some cases) If he was talking about girls, he has no right to be. You don't see us going around talking about the size of his penis. At least in public we don't. And not in front of six year olds.

      I went to a water park today. It turned out to be fun after the rain stopped and the kidlits took me on the water slides. Yay for water parks. I kinda forgot to put on sunscreen though, so I am currently a nice shade or pink and red over a majority of my body. Did I mention my senior pictures are a week from today? If anyone knows how to make me less pink and less sunburned, that would be absolutley wonderful.  :)    Congratulations to Joe for the job at Gap! Yay! Now we get to come visit!

      Happy 4th of July and all that.  The fireworks were really awesome last night. We met up with Steinaway's and tied our boats together and then had three other boats tied to them. Lots of people and a keg. Jackie had one too many beers and was a bit tipsy by the time we left. While the fireworks were going, she kept saying "This one is my favorite. The one that goes shwishishishsihs." It was great. Jenny curled up on my lap and sat still for the whole thing. That's a rarity since she is the biggest tomboy I have seen in my life. We won't get into that. After the fireworks, we waited for traffic to die down, so we sat on the boat and talked. Christopher fell asleep, so it was just me, Andy, and Jenny. Andy and I had taken the blanket from Jen, so we were warm and she wasn't. Mwa ha ha ha. Anyways, we just sat and talked and laughed about some of the stupidest crap imaginable. Next Sunday is breakfast on the boat with them. Yay! Monkey bread and fruit salad for everyone!  Since it is rainy and crappy out, mis padres (my parents) decided we are going to see Shrek 2 later. Yay! Sounds like fun. Last time I went to the movies with my parents and my brother (erlak!) we ran into the good ole Tabbert boys. Too bad the magically delicious Dave is in Russia. What the hell is in Russia? Dirt? Grass? Snow? Peasents? Whatever floats your boat I guess. Maybe I'll run into someone again. Maybe not.   Seeing Spiderman 2 with Abbey tomorrow. Woo! Tobey Maguire in tight clothing! What's tomorrow? Monday? Yes. Monday. A holiday for which I get paid for. I love working for a federal (or maybe state) run place. I get paid for all the holidays, even if I don't work on that day normally. There is an extra $30 to my paycheck. Not that I'm gonna get to see any of it.   I got my ACT scores back Friday. I got a 28. Do you know how much that sucks? I was hoping that by some miracle, I would get at least a 30. Now I have to take it again. The thing is though, I keep comparing myself to Leah, who got a 31 or 32 on her first try. Without a good calculator. Sure, I know that Leah is smarter then me, but I didn't think I would get a 28. Terribly long post, no one wants to read my whine anymore. Hasta!

      We went on the boat last night which I thought was gonna suck majorly, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. The water was really warm so I swam and we met up with Steinaways. It has been a long time since Andy was a little thing, and he has become a ton of fun. Too bad he's bringing la novia to the fireworks tonight.   Anyways, that was fun and I am looking forward to the fireworks. Not just because it's tradition, but because we didn't go last year. Dad threw out his back, so we had a bonfire. Invited the ex-bf (shudder) and had a night of it. Bad memories. Not really bad, just things I'd like to forget. I have forgotten a lot of things (thank God) and some things are left to be remembered. Okay, I am definitely babbling now.   Still waiting for a letter that I have decided will never come. Maybe he isn't worth it.   Came across Katherine's Blog today. Everyone should read today's  urlLink post .

      Think of someone who you haven't seen in a while. A month, or maybe a while is a few weeks. Now, try to remember their voice. It's hard. If you can remember a certain thing they used to say, it may be easier, but it's kinda hard if you didn't talk to them all that much.   Read a great piece of chic lit last night. It was called  Can You Keep A Secret?  Was about a chic who was afraid of flying and when her plane hits turbulence, she spills all her secrets to the guy she is sitting next to. She is also incredibly drunk. She never expects to see the guy again, but he turns out to be the founder of her company and he shows up at her work the next day. Anyways, she breaks up with her boyfriend, ends up going out with Mr. Founder guy. The shitty part of the book is when he goes on TV to promote the new product that is based towards women, and spills all her secrets to the office and to everyone in her family. We all know they get back together at the end, so it's very predictable. I liked it and it made me laugh. Took me 3 hours to read it. Yay! Another book to add to the 50 I'm supposed to be reading at work!  Am house sitting for some people for the next two weeks. Yay for money! And I got a raise! I think Holly said I am making $7.50 an hour, but I might have misheard and it's only $6.50. Anything is better then $6. Must go take a shower and make myself beautiful. (Insert Laugh Here)   Hasta!

      Abbey and I have been working on computer tech core stuff up at the school for a bit. Today, we were supposed to meet there at 11:30. At like 11:10 Ab called and asked if I could meet at 12:00 instead. Okay. No problem. So i'm there at 11:59. 31 minutes later I left b/c Abbey hadn't shown up. I got home and the phone rang. Abbey was running late, but she would be at the school in 10 minutes. So back to the school I go. We go to her mom's classroom, and there is a janitor there. She was getting ready to clean the floor. I wanted to cry. I have 2 or 3 days left to finish 7 or 8 lessons. I'll need as much time as possible. So Abbey made it up to me by taking me to Happy Days and buying me an icecream. I got one called "The Fonzie" which was vanilla ice cream, caramel, m&m's, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry. It was amazing. If I ate one more bite, I thought I was going to throw up. O, but it was tasty. I have to work today and tomorrow, then not until Saturday. Am getting exhausted from August being busy and it's only the 10th.  Also! In case you hadn't figured it out, the people from the post on July 23rd, Mr. and Mrs. *&amp;^%$#, is Sutton. Woo! I wonder if it will have 6 fingers and big ears.

      Abbey sent me a couple of links last night about band geekness. I just skimmed the list, but found a huge amount of them true. Also, on the band geek test, I scored "Ultimate Band Geek." Now for the links...   urlLink 829 ways to know when you are a band geek    urlLink The Band Geek Test    urlLink Marching Band Purity Test   Along with doing these last night, I was looking for more colleges. Aparently 2 isn't enough. Checked out Northern Michigan University. Looks pretty cool, except that they don't have a standard Architecture program. They have Pre-Architecture and Architectural Engineering. Looks interesting. Allison and I are planning a road trip up there sometime. Can't wait for that.  I'm also looking at MSU. My big turn off for them was that they don't allow clarinets, flute, and piccolo in the marching band. I would have to switch to saxophone or flags. You would have to shot me to do that. (no offense flags, since I was one for a whole 10-15 minutes my freshmen year) Then Allison and I were talking about it and I don't know if I want to continue in band. I love it know and I always will, but once in college, will I have time for it? Will I still want to do it? Maybe for a year, but I can probably find more amusing ways to occupy my time.  Everyone knows I've been holding out for U of M. It would be awesome if I got in, but becuase they let in too many people this year, they won't be letting that many people in next year. Lawrence Tech is mostly specialized for architecture, but they cost an arm and a let, not to mention I would have to live at home or have a full-time job to cover tuition. So, my dilemma is that I don't have enough colleges and I have to start applying in the first few months of school.  Will be at school again today, but I might not have to work later. Alayna called last night at 10:00 to tell me she needs to switch days. Needless to say, I was already in bed reading. I have to call her again, but it might be interesting. I haven't had a chance to get to know "the boy" (also known as Josh.) I only worked with him for Summer Reading Kick-off. I must go take a shower so I can become molded into my plastic computer chair at school. Sounds like fun.

      I got my senior pix back today. I look pretty good if I may say so myself.  I also had a clarinet meeting then went shopping for goody bags with Leah and Sarah. Then we came back here and put them together. Decorations and prettyness galore. Then Aj came over to give Mom band stuff. Had a chat with him. Apparently Bob is supposed to come over sometime too.  Must do tech core stuff tomorrow, so I'll be at the high school. Woohoo.

      Bree and I checked our horoscopes from the only reliable place we know, TV Guide. Or TV Book. Something like that.  Scorpios born after 1975 will encounter complex romantic proposals this week. Expect passionate invitations, rare overtures and bold flirtations from potential lovers. Refuse to allow long-term friends to feel isolated or abandoned. An obvious display of loyalty is needed.  Sounds like fun. Can't wait.

      I am already at work, and it feels like today is gonna be a long, slow day. The only perk up part is that I get to watch a movie later. I'm hoping people show up. Right now it's just Bree and me, and I'm hoping Julie doesn't show up then I get 2 extra hours to work...$15. I should be off shelving books, but that is rather boring...I'm gonna go read People, do a wordsearch, and think about shelving books.  For anyone who cares, we're showing Swiss Family Robinson at 1:00 today. At the library. Free popcorn. Ta!

      Is it possible, in this day and age, for someone, say a 17 year old, to realize that maybe, just maybe, she has some inkling of feelings towards someone almost 3 years her junior? Or is this just a confused, sexually pent up type feeling? Because, you know, it's been 2 months and a handful of days since that good day in the car. So now, I sit here wondering, is there something wrong with me? Why and the hell do I feel this way? Am I just bored and missing a good friend? Or is there more to this friendship? I am tired of waiting. I did my fair share of waiting last summer. I was hoping for this summer to be a lot different. I'm still hoping. Next week is looking up slightly and I wish I knew, right now, if he still likes me. If not then, I can move on to better things. Today is what, Thursday? Okay, so in something like five, six, maybe seven days, i'll know. Till then, Abbey, it's not who you think it is....or maybe it is. Hasta luego!

      I heard this song on the radio and thought, hmmm, sounds right to me. But there are some changes to be made.  Girls Lie Too Terri Clark  So she can't go out tonight again Her sister's sick, she's gotta baby-sit Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse  Now you didn't hear any of this from me But things aren't always what they seem Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you  Girls lie, too We don't care how much money you make  (Yes we do. poor (and cheap) guys suck)  What you drive or what you weigh  (We don't want it to break down in the middle of a date, but we don't care if it has a hemi or a v6)(Who wants a fat boyfriend?)  Size don't matter anyway  (That's a lie)  Girls lie, too Don't think you're the only ones Who bend it, break it, stretch it some We learn from you Girls lie, too  We can't wait to hear about your round of golf  (or how much you can bench press)  We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall  (ew)  And we like Hooter's for their hotwings too Other guys never cross our minds  (all the time...mmm, boys)  We don't wonder what it might be like How could it be any better than it is with you  Yeah, girls lie, too We always forgive and forget The cards and flowers you never sent Will never be brought up again Girls lie, too Old gray sweatpants turn us on  (added here is greasy clothing and major amounts of sweat)  We like your friends and we love your mom And that's the truth Girls lie, too Yeah that's the truth Girls lie, too  No, we don't care how much hair you have Yeah, that looks good Comb it over like that...  (reminds me of Sutton)

      I'm getting my senior pictures back on Sunday! Woo. Mom talked to the guy today and he said they turned out really good. The only problem was with the ones he took for the yearbook. So, at 12 on Sunday I have to get my pretty clothes back on to get a picture or two done, then pick up Allison's sister then be back here and done with everything at 1:00, so I can have a meeting with all my clarinets. Then Leah, Sarah and I are going shopping for stuff to go in the goody bags we're doing. I can't wait. It's gonna be great.  Abbey came over today to vent. She is one of those people who you can tell if they are upset on the phone. So she came over and cried because her tennis coach is an asshole. Then we went on a road trip to Busch's to buy taco shells so I could eat dinner.  I didn't eat at all today. I had mini muffins this morning for breakfast, a bowl of cantaloupe and raspberries for lunch and a fajita for dinner. Usually I am a major pig during the summer. Whatever. As long as I'm not feeling hungry and I'm not dizzy or nauseous.  Next week I'm going to be spending most of my time in the computer lab at school so I can finish up my computer tech core stuff. That sucks majorly. I don't mind though. If I get out of this, then I can take AP Engligh. Speaking of which, I am almost done with Power of One and The Secret History. Must be off though, Jeopardy is on.

      I ran into my cousin yesterday while he was at work. Busch's. Great place. Anyways. He said he was so very tired because he was working so much. Darn, I guess interning at 95.5 is horrible work and damn, he had to go to Tonic last night till 2 this morning and go to another night club tonight until tomorrow morning. There are even pictures of him on the internet. His intern name is  urlLink Frodo the 19 year old weird shirtless intern . It's cool to hear him on the radio though. You can also check him out getting arrested and goofing around on that website in the photos section. Woo! Go Aaron.  Vacation really wasn't all that bad. The weather was beautiful and I have a great tan. I'm pissed at my dad again because he didn't want to stay in Charlevoix for longer. That is my favorite place in Michigan. We looked at the boats. Ooo. Big boats. Someone wants compensation. (hee hee hee) It really lost it's appeal since I'd been up there 4 or 5 weekends before. I have to go back up on Labor Day weekend. That majorly sucks. I am now working on getting the halter tan lines to go away. Two of my three bathing suits are the same style, so I have major white marks when I wear a normal tank top.  I went over to Steinaways earlier to play with the cats and watch TV and play video game while they are gone, but I couldn't get into the house. They gave me the wrong key or something. Who knows. So I have to call Jeff later and figure out what to do. If nothing works, I'm breaking in. Who wants to help? jk.  This week looks like a long one followed by a few more long weeks before camp and school begins again. Hopefully this month will be much better then June and July were. Many reasons. I should probably eat some lunch since it's 2:46. I also have a huge craving for ice cream. mmm. Ice cream.
