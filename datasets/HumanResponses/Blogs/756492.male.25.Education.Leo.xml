       I am a huge movie buff.  The passing of Marlon Brando is a great loss for the acting community, for movie goers, and for the people who he knew and touched.  Perhaps Brando's most memorable role is Don Vito Corelone.  However, his portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee William's "A Streetcar Named Desire" is what his legacy will give to generations to come.    The raw emotion in his face, the gutteral scream that can be heard every year in New Orleans at the "Stella & Stanley Hollering Contest" will forever cast him as one of Hollywood's brightest stars.  Brando was quite a controversial figure in his lifetime:  - He let his stunning good looks which had won him scores of female admirers go at a seemingly early age. - He led an extremely personal and private life - He refused the Best Actor nomination he had won and let a Native American named Sacheen Littlefeather deliver the speech. - Brando had an amazing temper and in Brigette Bardot's Autobiography she recalls an incident where she had dressed up as a maid in a hotel to deliver his breakfast to him and he promptly threw those eggs against the wall and went back to sleep. - In Brando's later years he was living in an apartment alone, facing numerous threatened lawsuits and had a poor public image based on tales of failure to pay his child support.  It is better in his passing though to consider the immense library of work that will forever capture him in our hearts and memories.  Movies: The Score  (2001) Apocalypse Now: Redux  (2001) Free Money  (1998) The Island of Dr. Moreau  (1996) Don Juan DeMarco  (1995) Edward R. Murrow - The Best of 'Person to Person'  (1993) Christopher Columbus: The Discovery  (1992) The Freshman  (1990) A Dry White Season  (1989) The Formula  (1980) Apocalypse Now  (1979) Superman - The Movie  (1978) Roots - The Next Generations - Ep. 7  (1978) Superman  (1978) The Missouri Breaks  (1976) Last Tango in Paris  (1973) The Godfather  (1972) The Nightcomers  (1972) Burn!  (1970) The Night of the Following Day  (1968) Candy  (1968) Reflections in a Golden Eye  (1967) A Countess From Hong Kong  (1967) The Appaloosa  (1966) The Chase  (1966) Morituri  (1965) The Saboteur, Code Name Morituri  (1965) Bedtime Story  (1964) The Ugly American  (1963) Mutiny on the Bounty  (1962) One-Eyed Jacks  (1961) The Fugitive Kind  (1960) The Young Lions  (1958) Sayonara  (1957) Teahouse of the August Moon  (1956) Guys and Dolls  (1955) Desiree  (1954) On the Waterfront  (1954) The Wild One  (1954) Julius Caesar  (1953) Viva Zapata!  (1952) A Streetcar Named Desire  (1951) The Men  (1950)  (List courtesy of E!Online : http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/0,12,54,00.html?celfact2)  Brando's last role was in 'The Score', a movie I highly enjoyed.  However, he left his own unique mark on the film's set by apparently telling Frank Oz "F__K You!" after Oz gave him some direction.  The man was cantankerous as ever.    Legendary people have legends that are cultivated over time.  Brando's legend will surely never die and his amazing work in nearly every movie role he ever played will shine on for generations to come.

       In my last post I wrote about the problems I was having with the AOI WYSIWYG editor and the system data migration I'm working on...  Well, I figured out the problem.  It turns out that Blackboard doesn't really know their own database very well.  I think this is just another problem for them in an already pathetic support model they've built at the corporate level.   Background   Any time you make a post in a Blackboard Learning System course it is entered into the database with an entry that tells the system how to interpret the data.  This is called a content handler in Blackboard-speak.  When someone utilizing the AOI WYSIWYG plugin made a post in blackboard the content handler was set to: 'resource/x-aoi-dhtmledit'.  As I mentioned in my last post, AOI was purchased by Blackboard and the WYSIWYG is essentially the same in version 5.5.1 as it is in 6.1!  Even if they  were  different, the code they are creating is HTML so it shouldn't really matter!  In the migration process the x-aoi-dhtmledit content handler type was not being converted.  Therefore...all I did was make a post with the new editor to determine what its content handler type was referred to in the database (resource/x-bb-document if you care to know).  With those two pieces of information I simply replaced the aoi handler with the blackboard handler and VOILA an instant solution to a really disturbing problem.  It took me about 10 minutes in total to solve the problem once I starting poking around in the database.   Current Situation   Now the current situation has me frustrated because I need Blackboard to write me a script that I can run on my fully migrated database that will make this content handler change database wide automatically without me actually needing to go through the process of doing it by hand!  I figured this out yesterday around noon, and sent an email at 1pm (noon in Blackboard's timezone) and I  STILL  haven't heard back from them!  This is particularly irritating to me because I basically solved the problem myself in a situation where Blackboard 100% dropped the ball in the development of the blackboard system migration tool.  If I can figure it out...why couldn't the company that built the system figure it out?  And why when I send them a solution on a golden platter...don't they:  a) Thank me... b) Recognize that I saved their butts c) Call me back in a reasonable amount of time!   Moving Forward   I just want to be sure that the folks who will see this product in an every day situation understand that it is easy to use.  If that means the grunt work in dealing with Blackboard has to be more difficult than it should be...then so be it...  blackboard is well liked in the district, is easy to use, and can be a powerful agent for e-learning.  My only hope is that Blackboard can learn how to manage their customer issues better in the future.

       For the past 3 weeks I've been working with the Wake County Public School System as the Blackboard Administrator for their 4,200 courses and 134,000 user installation.  This is a gigantic installation that gets somewhere in the neighborhood of 28,000 hits a day every day of the year including Christmas and New Year.  Currently, the version that is installed and supporting those users is Blackboard 5.5.1 which is stable and works well.  The problem is that it is really cumbersome to use compared to the latest release 6.1.5.    The 5.5.1 system utilizes a WYSIWYG plugin called AOI Systems WYSIWYG.  This plugin added functionality that didn't exist in 5.5.1 previously.  It was such a great tool that Blackboard purchased it from AOI Systems.  Unfortuantely that is where the problem starts.  Any content created with the AOI WYSIWYG tool in 5.5.1 is  NOT  migrating to 6.1!!!  When I call Blackboard they claim that it works, which it does not. Then they accused me of being the problem with the migration of the data, which I am not since the migration tool completed successfully.    I called AOI Systems and they were aware that the Blackboard migration tool didn't successfully convert the data created with their tool!  Essentially Blackboard developers were so singularly focused on their product, they forgot that they bought a plugin that was widely used.  They never created any contingency plans for folks that had created content with the plugin. So rather than fix the problem they are stalling me and saying that it is really my fault that the data migration isn't going smoothly when AOI and I know that their migration tool was coded poorly.  This is in addition to all the other support I've required where the answer I've recieved is "Sorry!  That isn't documented, but you need to install Hotfix 3..." Or..."Yeah...that didn't make it into the documentation!  You'll need to do X, Y, and Z before that will work."  I don't mean to be ultra critical here, but updating documentation is a key component of reducing help desk calls.  Keeping documentation accurate is essential to keeping customers happy.  Then when they call blaming them for problems, or admitting that the company did a poor job in documentation only makes the situation worse.  It's no wonder that large accounts are going away from Blackboard every year.  Michigan State University used to be a huge supporter of Blackboard, but their terrible customer service, ridiculus licensing fee increases, and generally poor instructional design lead them to go with ANGEL.  I am definitely a Blackboard advocate because it is easy to use for end users.  However, dealing with them on the management level is a total nightmare.  It takes 1 or 2 days to get answers to questions that either shouldn't be asked...or should just take moments to answer.

       I recently moved to Cary, NC a suburb of Raleigh the state capital.  It's a great town with fantastic people, a great economy, and a lot of fun recreational things to keep my wife and me busy for quite some time.  One of the enjoyable things that I miss most about living in the Detroit area of Michigan is that there are no good morning radio shows here in Raleigh!  Detroit had classics like Dick Purtan and Purtan's People, Johnny & the Morning Crew, Mojo in the Morning, Drew & Mike, and a lot of other really funny people sounding off on the airwaves over the morning.  In Raleigh...it's either Redneck humor about trucks, NASCAR, or some combination...or it's quasi-news funny that is rarely funny and usually ultra-right wing conservative DJs sounding off about how shocking the news is.  I am shocked by the news as well.  I think everyone is...it wouldn't really be news if it wasn't shocking.  Get over it!    The WORST perpetrators of this nonsense are Bob & Sherrie a nationally syndicated show.  They rarely have anything worth while to say or even anything that's particuarly funny.  For the past 2 weeks they've done nothing but gripe about the news.  If I wanted to hear that I'd watch the news in the evening...their commentary is worthless and not funny at all.  I don't have to listen to them and I don't any more.  The problem is...there isn't anything else to listen to other than my CDs, which unfortunately don't provide traffic reports so I can avoid problems on the road to work.  So, I'm forced to listen to redneck movie reviews which is a particuarly offensive little bit that 101.5 FM does in the mornings or I'm forced to hear every Monday about morons who sit and watch other morons make left hand turns all day long.  I have a few ideas about why this is like this:  1) The FCC decency standards are scaring away any creative attempts at comedy 2) The DJs in Raleigh are second rate morons 3) The world is so depressing that comedy is dying 4) DJs in Raleigh actually believe their listeners care about what they think about news  It's truly pathetic.

       Just a little tid-bit about the new PIRATE act...  If you haven't heard already the Senate passed the PIRATE act which allows the Government to get involved in the Civil prosecution of file swappers.  Currently, the RIAA has only been able to pursue Criminal suits against these folks which has meant that there was no real long term fiscal responsibility, only the threat of jail time.    I don't believe in file swapping or Peer-To-Peer networking for the simple reason I don't believe in installing a giant neon light on my house that says: "The doors unlocked come in and take what you'd like!"  It's a highly insecure way to trade legitimate data, and is subject to every horrible little virus transmission and illegal data swapping possible.  That said...I firmly believe the RIAA is attacking it's customers.  The logic seems flawed.  A) Peer-To-Peer networks provide a medium for the transmission of copyrighted materials B) File-Swappers take advantage of the network to trade music, movies, and other copyrighted software for free C) RIAA and Hollywood become involved to try to understand and curb the problem  This is where the logic gets strange...  D) The majority of folks swapping files indicate that they are strapped for cash to pay for high priced music, movies, and software. E) RIAA and Hollywood and Software companies decide that rather than find a model that works commercially to naturally correct the illegal market...they will sue potential customers. F) RIAA and Hollywood get the Federal Government involved...not to create sanctions to protect their work...but to attack potential consumers because their profits have fallen 2.5 Billion worldwide in a time when the World Economy has been in the biggest recession since the 1930s.  The reason that the logic here is so skewed is that there ARE viable ways to exploit existing networks for profit and bring disgruntled consumers BACK.  There is an old business model that favors lower cost, lower margin, higher volume sales.  Consider McDonald's.  If you walk into a McDonald's buy a combo meal, eat there, and leave it probably cost them 3 bucks to serve your 6 dollar meal.  They could easily charge 7 dollars and increase their profit margin by over 15%, which nationwide could amount to millions of dollars a day from a simple 1 dollar price increase...  HOWEVER, McDonald's understands that there is a critical price at which consumers will freely pass their money over the counter for sub-standard service and burgers that only resemble beef.  The record and movie industry don't seem to grasp this concept.  For instance....  Sony Music could easily open an online music store wherein they decide how much a song could potentially cost them.  They mark that song up 33% and create a system where you pay a monthly subscription that entitles you to 15 song downloads a month or the equivalent of 1 album worth of songs in a month.  We'll say that monthly fee is $12.95.    That's less than it costs in the store, they get better market research because they see which individual SONGS and ARTISTS are making them money and they can market and develop similar artists because they will KNOW their consumers better.  Another added benefit is that folks don't need to steal music because they could create a supplemental network for file sharing that could be accessed for an additional 5 dollars a month.  This network would be from OTHER record labels that have sold their songs to their users.  For every song you are sharing, you are able to download half a song from the network.  So if you own 150 songs, you could download 75 songs from the network for free.  In this way the music industry self-regulates file swapping and provides the RULES under which it can be fiscally successful for them.  On any given song they may only make 50 cents.  But, if they attract 1 million users in the entire united states on a monthly bases that's nearly 13 million dollars a month in subscription fees or 156 million dollars a year if 1 million people bought 12 months of subscription service at the basic rate, and never bought another CD, and didn't join the file swapping network.  My guess is that a business model like this could bring in somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 million dollars in it's first year alone with technology and infrastructure that is already cheap, easily created, and well documented.  Why do I propose this?  I HIGHLY doubt that suing fileswappers (while their right as it is illegal) will garner any long term support from users or come close to repaying the lost revenue they've already seen....  Be Smart.  Be Safe. Don't Swap. Be part of the Solution.

       I'm not a rabid Harry Potter fan.  My wife is definitely a crazed fan who can zoom through the children's books as though they were a delicious Chunky Monkey pint for the mind.    I have read the first three books and will continue to read the books as more movies come out (obviously prior to seeing them because I really enjoy seeing how movie makers translate text into the visual medium).    Down to business though...  As you probably read, if you're aware of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling has released the title to the 6th book in the Harry Potter series.  You can find the article that I read about it  urlLink here.   Apparently it will be called,  Harry Potter and Half Blood Prince.     I didn't realize that J.K. Rowling had a website, but I went looking for it and quickly found it at:  urlLink http://www.jkrowling.com .  What a fantastic site for people of all ages.  I wasn't really all that impressed with the graphic design on it because I think it's just way too cluttered to really enjoy visually.  What I  REALLY  enjoyed was the level of interraction between the author and her fans.  She addresses rumors, adds little side pieces of information to enhance the world she created, she provides a pretty lengthy self-promoting sappy biography, and even a mystery.    She has a cell-phone in the upper left side of the main site, which looks like a desk incidentally.  This phone can be switched on using the power cord to the right of it and you can enter numbers into it.  I cannot figure it out...Perhaps this has some significance?  If anyone knows...drop me a note!

       Recently I keep reading millions of websites about the impact of blogs on culture and the impact that blogging as a movement is making on the way in which we communicate.  Unfortunately I've decided that those observations are a bit jaded.  The fact is, blogging statistics never seem to fully reflect the trend in blogging which is post infrequently, or to post furiously for a month and then never post again.  That said, I hope to break this trend and keep my own blog focused.  As this is the first post of posts I should give a little background information about myself.  1) I'm vain.  I'm losing my hair.  I hate it.  I'm 25.  2) I'm fantastically devoted internet.  I don't know why.  I think it's vapid.  Most of the web is worthless or lude.  3) I'm a lifelong learner.  I might be a know-it-all.  I get excited about new ideas. Most of the new ideas I hear are old news to other people.  4) I'm a guy and I like cats.  I have a himalayan named Mouschkie.  He weighs 15 pounds. He is high maintenance.  5) 3 is a magic number.  I don't know why.  It just is.  3, 6, 9 ... 12, 15, 18 ...  6) Sports.  Lions, Tigers, BoSox, Pats, Pistons, Spartans, and Red Wings (I'm a Detroit born sports fan living in North Carolina)  Finally...you should know what I'll be covering in this blog as it moves forward.  It's actually going to be quite topical...  I'm employed in E-learning and I'll be writing a lot about that.  I am mainly focused on the K-12 market segment which I think is drastically underserved by distance learning and electronic resources to aid learning.  So I'll be covering interesting developments and products that facilitate best practice within distance education for K-12 kids.  Like I said...I love the web.  I'll be writing about websites here.  I should be including some reviews of whole sites like safari.oreilly.com, and also of specific elements of websites like a particular animation, or navigational feature that I particularly like.  I will also cover some sports in this blog as well.  I am a total sports nut and my cat (you remember my 15 pound himalayan) comes to the sofa when he hears the Sportscenter theme song!  It's really bizarre.  I attended Michigan State University so I love the Spartans, and my favorite sport (really my obcession in life) is Football.  I love college football, and professional football with a love that is undying.  I got to go to Football Hall of Fame (which I'll cover later) and it was magical.  Well, that's what you can expect from this little blog.  I hope you'll come back, ask questions, leave comments, and just in general participate in an active blog.
