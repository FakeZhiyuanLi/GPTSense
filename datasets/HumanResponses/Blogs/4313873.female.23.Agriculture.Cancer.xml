      Short and Sweet...? I am new to the land of posts, although this may be a fun little place to write out my vents, since I can't call some people about some of my vents.  So for the most recent vent:  I used to be good friends with Tracy. She was my roommate for a year, didn't work out, she moved out with some partying guys. After a year of not speaking to eachother, we once again became friends because we had school together. Later on I made a comment to Jennifer (reference later) and the comment was told to Tracy and now I am not friends with Tracy once again. This has been now for a year.  I was also once really good friends with Jennifer. She came along with my family on a cruise among many other occasions. She turned 21 3 months after me and really wanted to experience the "bar scene" which I was not interested in at the time. I suggested she go with Tracy, since Tracy was into that, and from then on, they were inseparable.  Joined at the hip, same annoying habits, same annoying inside "you had to be there..." Jokes and on and on. I felt like such an outsider one night when I went out with them. I quit hanging out with either of them because anytime I would call Jennifer, she would already have plans with Tracy. It got to the point to where, if I wanted to hang out with Jennifer, I would have to call on Monday, to see if she wanted to do something Saturday, but usually her schedule was already booked.  So I gave up.  I quit calling Jennifer. (by the way, when I am typing and not paying attentions, most of the time it comes out "jenniger" and I have to go back and fix it, but I think I will stop correcting it and see how it comes out).  I talked to her for a brief 3 minutes or so last march, just because we had a class together. (that she quit showing up for right after this point) I had just gotten my braces and she noticed and made a comment "Oh, you finally got your braces!!! How do they feel?" I said "weird" and that was about it.  I haven't spoken to her since- except for these 2 occasions. I make a point to avoid her, and Tracy whenever possible.  1. At the PBR at the end of March, I saw her walking. I made a fake "hi" smirk, she said (through a crowd) "Hi Angela!" and I replied along with my fake smirk "hi." 2. Last night, my best friend Amanda came to visit me from Paso Robles. We went to Applebee's for dinner and were waiting for another 2 girls to show up. From the corner of my eye, I saw 2 girls, so I looked up and DAMNIT the eye contact, it was Tracyfer. (that's the name of the inseparable hookers!) Jennifer said "Hi Angela" and I once again replied with a RUDE "HI."  The whole scenario of last night was funny. Amanda hates Tracy because Amanda's Ex Jeff, dated Tracy before he dated Amanda and rudeass Tracy insists on calling Jeff (usually in the middle of booty) whenever she is drunk. Where they sat, Amanda had to look directly at Tracy, so loudly I said "Would you like to sit on that side?" and she said "YES!!! Otherwise I may get up and hit someone!"   Tracy thinks she is hot shit, and her whiff has rubbed off on Jennifer (hence the term Tracyfer) Jennifer used to be little miss shy, do nothing bad, and now I bet she goes down on anybody! Supposedly she was "waiting until she got married" but then why does she have a dildo?  So the next exciting step.... We were once all friends with Jenni. Jenni's fiance Ryan never really liked Tracy because she would make him uncomfortable. She would hit on him. So Jenni was not very close with Tracy. She is probably more close with Jennifer than me, but we are still friends. Problem? Jennifer and I are bridesmaids in Jenni and Ryans wedding in March.  I can suck it up for the wedding. But I don't know about the bachelorette party if Tracyfer is coming along. Jennifer would be ok to deal with, but not Tracy, and not Tracyfer. And then there is a lingerie shower and or a bridal shower. I am hostessing a scrapbooking party in November and it is not up to me who is invited (although I REALLY wish it was). And the thing that really pisses me off: - Another Bridesmaid Jackie is hostessing a "Pampered Chef for the bride" September 4th. Jenni asked Jennifer to come since all the bridal party will be there. Jennifer denied the invitation because "That is her birthday weekend and they are having a party" (Jenni has had this planned since May! So it is a bit pathetic to plan your birthday party that far in advance!)  Well- I could go on and on and on about this situation, but I will save the rest for the next post. I have the first day of school tomorrow morning at 9am, and I am sure I will have to park in timbucktoo (the farm)
