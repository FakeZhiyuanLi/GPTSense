      So I decided to take advantage of this wonderful Memorial Day weather by heading out for a round of disc golf.  Playing as much disc golf as possible on Memorial Day weekend had become a tradition of mine, as there's nothing I enjoyed better than driving between courses with the 97X WOXY Modern Rock 500 Countdown on the radio.  Unfortunately, since 97X is no more, something felt like it was missing this year.  Anyhow, Nick and I play a round of disc golf out at Winton Woods.  Unfortunately, the cicadas were so bad that they were almost deafening in certain parts.  And then they were swarming like no other in a few areas.  Believe it or not, my ears were actually ringing like they do when I leave a concert.  Needless to say, we quit after one round because of the cicadas.  I managed to shoot (-7) for the round despite no birdies on the first 7 holes.    Started working on my final homework assignment of my college career tonight.  Would have had the sucker finished had it not be that I am stuck on a few parts.  Looks like I'll have to finish that up tomorrow during the day.  I also cannot wait to get this damn IDS project presentation out of the way on Friday.  Lemme say, this project sucks.

      So here I am, working on my first entry in my Blog.    Starting my own online journal is something I've been wanting to do for quite some time.  I've actually never really kept a journal on a regular basis before; however, in looking back on the past, I wish this was something I had done on a regular basis.  The thought on doing this first crossed my mind back in the fall of 2003.  Entering my senior year of track here at UC, I had this sense that the upcoming season was going to be something special.  I thought it would be neat to chronicle the daily ups and downs of the season and reflect back on it sometime down the road.  Turns out the season was something special as we won the Conference title and were undefeated as a team for the entire season.  We were definitely the best track and field team ever here at UC.  I personally had a pretty decent year, but it certainly had its ups and downs.  Unfortunately, I never did really get started on that journal, but I do plan on doing some entries down the road reflecting back on the season while the memories are still fresh in my mind.  So I am currently one week away from being down with college.  As with the case of numerous people I've talked to, I was ready as ever to get out of here and onto the real world up until about two months ago.  Now, I don't really want college to end.  Strange, eh?

      So here it is.  Thursday evening.  As of tomorrow at 5:00pm, all my schoolwork toward my degree will be complete.  Kind of a strange feeling, considering I've been working toward this degree for five years now.  Once again, as with a lot of things going on in my life, I've got that bittersweet feeling in me right now.  Sure, I'm definitely not going to miss all the stress and long hours of studying, but what I am going to miss are the friendships that have developed over the past five years with my classmates.  I've spent the majority of the past four years of classes with the same group of about 25 of us, so I've gotten to know most of them pretty well.  For those people I don't care for in our class, this has been bad, but for those classmates of mine who I've become good friends with, it's going to be tough facing the reality I won't be seeing them on a regular basis anymore.  One of my good friends in my class is already married and has a kid on the way this summer, several more of my friends have accepted jobs out of town, so I'm starting to realize I'm starting to get old.     As with a lot things, the big advice I can give people is to enjoy things while they last, because sooner or later, all good things will come to an end.  Enjoy every one of those weekends while you're in college, because before you know it, you'll be out in the real world living the boring, uneventful life.  Enjoy the friendships you develop, because eventually you'll all move on in different paths in life.  Enjoy those activities you become involved with, because sooner or later, your time will come to move on.  And lastly, enjoy life as it is.  Be thankful with what God had handed to you and make the most of it.
