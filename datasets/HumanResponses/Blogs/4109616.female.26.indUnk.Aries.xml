      I thought I'd write a little bit about what I've been reading.  I'm tired of having deep, profound thoughts and I don't feel like ranting about anything, so a blurb about my reading will be a nice change.  I have about 50 books piled up in my apartment, patiently waiting for their turn to be read and put into their proper spots on my shelves.  At the moment, I'm working my way through  Possession  by A.S. Byatt, kind of meandering through a small anthology of poetry and avoiding a book of interviews with Margaret Atwood.    Possession  has me a bit miffed, because I swing between loving it and hating it like some sort of out of whack pendulum.  Just when the story becomes interesting and I start to get drawn in - wham.  Byatt switches gears and I lose my enthusiasm.  For anyone who doesn't know,  Possession  is the book that spawned the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhardt.  It deals with two scholars who find that the Victorian poets they are researching had an affair.  I like the mystery of the Victorian storyline, but I find the scholars - Maud and Roland - dull.   The poetry anthology is a Dover Thrift edition called  100 Best Loved Poems  and it has a bunch of well known works in it.  ( The Raven  by Poe,  Tyger, Tyger  by Blake, etc.)  I'm trying to find my footing in the world of poetry by sampling different poets to see what I like and don't like.  So far I have discovered the I love Emily Dickinson and  hate  Percy Shelley.  That "hate" is in bold, because I really mean it.  He revolts me.  The book of interviews...well, I find Margaret Atwood very intense and intellectual in her interviews and I'm having trouble wading through them.  My brain doesn't want to cooperate.  I think it has had enough of my intellectual posturing and has decided to take a vacation to force me to read more fantasy novels.  That could be my problem with  Possession  as well.   Well, I guess that's enough of that for today.  I think I'm going to try to do some more reading!

      Over the last few days I've been tempted many, many times to just yell at people. For example, yesterday at the AGO, I was looking at a gorgeous series of Monet paintings, when I heard a whiny voice complaining, "Why does he have to mush all his colours together like that?" That was followed by a companion voice replying, "I just find that he's too repetitive." I am in LOVE with Monet's work, so my first reaction was to turn around and smack them, and then explain why he "mushes" (grrrr....) his colours around and why these paintings AREN'T repetitive. I decided that subtlety was probably going to be lost on these people, so I didn't bother. Sometimes it's a real struggle for me to keep my opinions to myself, even with complete strangers. I literally wanted to yell, "What is wrong with you people?" I'm very opinionated, and I'm a total know-it-all sometimes, but MUSH?! Whatever. There are times when I want to walk up to someone and just kick them in the shins. Maybe I need to get some anger management training. Of course, I DON'T scream or kick anybody, as much as I want to, so I guess I am actually managing my anger pretty well. And I vent to my mother. We have some great conversations:  Me: "...and she said he 'mushes' his colours, Mom! It was so traumatic!" Mom: "That's terrible, dear. Is this Claude a friend of yours?"  I love my mother. She puts things in perspective for me.

      I have to be more lighthearted in my blogging today, because if I keep being so thoughtful, I'm going to end up depressed.  Sometimes you just have to stop thinking for a little bit and give yourself a break.  And it's great timing for me to take a break because I have a few days off starting at 3am when I get off work.  Isn't that crazy?  I don't know anyone else who works until 3am.  The company pays for my cab ride home, thankfully, or I'd probably be attacked or something.  I've thought about carrying pepper spray, but with my luck my attacker would get the spray away from me and use it on me.  I think a stomp on the foot and then a knee to the groin are always better.  That and a really quick temper.  Of course, that's the thing that always seems to get me into trouble...  Honestly, I don't think I should be allowed to work until 3am, because the quality of my work just goes steadily downhill.  I'm covering for someone who has gone on vacation and I'm not expected to do much, but I had an encounter with a piece of equipment that is going to keep me blushing for DAYS!  It was one of those things where you try to figure out what the problem is, you can't see it for the life of you and then when you finally get a tech to take a look, it turns out that you pressed the wrong button.  Grrrrr.

      I just recently started watching Third Watch in syndication on A&E and today the first of the 9/11 episodes aired.  I was in tears by the end of the episode and for some reason I felt the need to watch it again tonight when it reaired.  And of course, I was upset by it again.  It's like pressing on a bruise to see if it still hurts.  And I'm always surprised that it still does hurt.  I can't see images from that day without feeling my skin start to crawl.  I remember every single moment of that day from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed...and then stayed up all night because I could hear the jets circling over Lake Ontario.  I ended up taking my blankets and pillows to the living room and curling up with a pile of books.  Sometime in the middle of the night I realized that I wasn't sad anymore; I was seriously pissed off.  I was angry that I had turned the television on  just in time  to see the second plane hit.  I was angry that the terrorists had  planned  for me and everyone else to be watching when that second plane hit.  I was angry that I had spent the whole day alone and terrified.  I don't know how anyone else feels about this, but I can't seem to eject all the bad feelings that are associated with the attacks even though it's been years now.  I can't imagine how anyone living in New York City must still feel...

      I just finished playing my new CSI board game with a friend and it was fun.  I still love Monopoly the best, though.  There's just something about playing a board game that is way too fun.  Unless you're playing with a board game Nazi, like my Dad.  He get really ticked off if he's losing.  I mean, I'm competitive but I can't help laughing even when I'm losing.  And doing little chair dances when I'm winning.   Card games are great, too!  My best friend and I tend to play cards a lot when we're at the airport or waiting for a concert to start.  It's a great way to pass the time, except we only ever play Crazy Eights or Go Fish.  One of us needs to get a book on card games so we can learn to play something else.

      I just read that quote from the cover jacket of a book I bought today.  That statement made me pick the book up and bring it home.  The book's called  Life After God  by Douglas Coupland and it's a collection of short stories about people who find their spirituality outside of church or organized religion.  I myself didn't go to church with my family as a child.  I went to church for a while each Sunday with our neighbours out of curiousity.  I was only seven or eight.  Then when I was  a teenager I went to church for a good year with some family friends.  My little brother did the same thing.  My parents don't agree with organized religion, but they made sure we could do as we saw fit.  And both of us ended up feeling the same way.  It's funny but I'm a very spiritual person even though my experiences with church didn't leave any strong positive impressions on me.  It's not that going was unpleasant or that the people at the church were too stern, but in my second experience I really felt as if I was joining a cult.  I felt that I was "expected" to act in a certain way and I could feel the disapproval if I didn't exactly match the expectations of others in the church.  I don't feel closer to God in a building full of people.  I feel more at peace when I'm in an environment that wasn't created by human hands - a forest, a field, even on a beach beside the ocean.  Frank Lloyd Wright said "I believe in God, only I spell it NATURE."  I believe my own spirituality is actually based in the wonder that I feel when I study the living things on this planet.

      I have to apologize in advance to anyone who considers Bill Clinton their hero, because I just don't get it!  I was at Indigo at Bay and Bloor yesterday and there were people EVERYWHERE to get their copies of his book signed.  It was like he was a rock star!  There were helicopters hovering over the store.  Craziness.  And then today in the paper, there's a picture of him hugging this woman and all I could think was "Well, there's a prime groping opportunity, Billy."  I wonder if he DID grope her...now that woman can write a book if he did.  I believe that George W. Bush's unpopularity is linked to Bill Clinton's popularity.  Not that Clinton wasn't an all right President, but I didn't see him do anything amazing.  Of course, when I heard about Monica I couldn't bring myself to pay anymore attention to him anyway.  I'll never look at cigars the same way again.  And this post has officially taken a turn for the worse!   I got a great surprise at work today!  I entered a CSI trivia contest months ago and I finally got my prize pack today!  I got the new board game, some books and stuff and, the best part...a CSI maglight!  I'm going to attach it to my belt and whip it out at people like I'm investigating a crime.  It'll go over great at the bar tonight...

      I've have just had the nastiest two days.  And it's not because I've been seriously ill or anything bad has happened.   I just feel really beat up.  Literally.  My whole body kind of aches.  I'm not sick, but I guess sometimes God just decides that you need to feel miserable for a few days.  Or maybe I have some mystery illness that just makes you achy and grouchy for a few days.  Actually, I think that's called PMS.   I had three days off and I really didn't do anything exciting.  I had to do laundry, get groceries, clean the bathroom...etc, etc.  And the cats needed some attention, because they were both looking scruffy.  They have long hair and if I don't brush them once in a while they begin to look like hairy rats.  A friend of mine just got back from helping to build a community centre in Africa.  She was showing me some pictures and it was really interesting.  Everyone looked so happy in the shots, and I caught myself thinking, "These people live in huts."  They don't need anything else as far as they're concerened.  I mean, the only things they want are things we take for granted: clean water, healthy food, proper medical care...and they don't even have those things most of the time, but they still have fun when they can.  It kind of puts my complaints into perspective.  I was just complaining about feeling run down for a few days, but at least I don't have malaria!  And the hypochondriac part of my brain just thought of West Nile.  Lovely.  Michelle

      I love Victorian literature - Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Arthur Conan Doyle, the Bronte sisters...I could go on and on.  My favourite author of this era is Jane Austen.  Although her novels were published before Victoria became Queen she's usually classified as Victorian.  I have this wierd sort of understanding of the way Victorian society worked.   Some people find it incomprehensible, but I find it sort of comforting for some reason.  I also have an affinity for old fashioned hobbies.  I love to knit and embroider.  It's kind of rare to find someone my age who will admit to that!  There's something really soothing to me about these activities even though I'm not really an old fashioned type of person.  Maybe I just inherited my grandmother's hobbies from living with her in college.  She never could get me to use a sewing machine though...  I'm just rambling on because it's almost six am and I've been awake all night.  I'm sitting at work right now and I've got about another hour to go.  This is usually the easiest part of night shift, because I'm starting to think about getting home and that makes me wake up a bit.  That and Degrassi Junior High airs at six and who doesn't love Degrassi?

      I had no idea what a blog was until a few days ago, when some members of an online chat group started putting theirs together. I thought it would be a fun way to let others that I chat with online get to know a bit about me!  So, first off, the title of this spot is a bit girlie, but there's an explanation. I'm not very good at coming up with titles, log ons, etc. And I have two cats - one is named Cricket and the other is named Daisy. I admit that it's a bit nauseating, but I love them and tell everyone stories about them knocking things over, chewing on books and just doing things that would make anyone else kill them. I'm one of those people who think it's endearing when they destroy something of mine...to a point anyway! So, that's my main weakness - my cats.  My second weakness is reading. I spend hours every day with my nose stuck in a book - on the subway, at work, at home, at the gym...I am virtually never without a book in my purse and I refuse to buy a purse that isn't big enough to at least hold a paperback.  I have other hobbies, interests and various nerdy tendencies, but I'll get to them in other posts! Enjoy!
