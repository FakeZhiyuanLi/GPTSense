      Yes so, the ONLY thing of any utter importantce right now.. It is in fact, June 30th, and this fact therefore means Incubus concert tonight, which also means that I am NOT going... anyone catching on? Yes that's right, I'm about to tears of this fact which is just a bunch of shit in its own right.    However in a brighter light, it is making me EXTREMELY anxious for Warped Tour, which is going to be AWESOME, right Tan? Ahh get excited! And we will in fact take over Hershey Park in its entirety by 12 (noon) on the day of Warped Tour... better believe it!   Blah... yes BLAH today has sucked a biiig dicky like whoa... that's right I've accomplished just about nothing... decided I was NOT making another trip to my daddys until psycho-bitch/child-abusing-16/13/12-yr-old-kid-hitter/22-yr-old-mother/SLUT-bag/etc. is gone... and so therefore tonight I'm homefree, as for this wknd... sad part though, is that I'm scheduled to work EVERYDAY this wknd... hello?! has anyone ever heard of 'The 4th of July' yanno, that BIG holiday that everyone celebrates the anniversary of our GREAT country's independence, like fireworks, food, etc... umm yeah I guess the awesome people at PG didn't... so that means... no parties Fri night for moi, no River Fireworks Sat. and NO picnics Sunday... umm yeah, def feel a sudden illness coming on, at least for Friday night anyways, because I, LACEY MARIE KAHLER do NOT miss the River Fireworks like EVER... so fuck um... :)  As for everything else that's been going on... nothing fun or exciting, this summer is beginning to blow... already... Monday however, was FUN FUN FUN... went to Empire for the day with Jaci, got my hair all did up and shitz... AWESOME... and yes it was a good day in general... Lina stayed over Monday night, fun as usual... yesterday was just blah though... worked 4:30-9... I think the schedule should say about 9:30 from now on, cause I haven't gotten out at 9 for the past like 3 wks... I hate it, as does everyone else, cannot wait til the Florida movement is permanent haha!   Alright mommy's home... time to go and find something to take my mind off of this horrible catastrophy of missing the Incubus concert :(... wish me luck ;)  Love you all!

      Yes sooo today was def. the last day of school this year, t/g! Ahh... as of now, no graduation ceremonies for moi... dunno if it's the sudden lack of interest, or the fact that there's other festivites going on that I'd like to attend, needless to say I'm not planning on attending '04 grad, which in the long run, is most likely gonna come back to bite me in the ass.  As Tan put it, we have most of our EXTREMELY gorgeous men leaving us tonight, which, indeed will be sure to shed tons of tears, so maybe that's the reason I'm not going.  Anyyyways... today was tons of fun... ya'll know what I'm talking about... celebrating is always a good time with the pals, but today was a outright blast haha.  As for this evening, I really need to get some massive energy, and very soon if I'm going to do everything I've got planned, which includes: dress fitting @ 6, then POSSIBLY graduation ceremonies, depending on the time and what not, so doubt it... then coming home for a bit... and outtie for the night :)... tomorrow though, shall suck the big dick.  Tomorrow most-likely includes a massive lack of sleep, and work from 2-9... yes no fun there! Anyways, time to get my ass in gear... HOPEFULLY tonight all goes well... with the lack of shedding tears :-/  Love ya's!
