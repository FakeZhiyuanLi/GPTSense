      Well, the deed is done. I put my two weeks notice of resignation in at work today. This action stems from a couple of reasons...but for now, we will leave it at personal health. I have been having trouble with my diabetes, resulting recently in my car accident. My absence was not received well at work. The tests that were done while I was in the hospital showed that things with me are not as they should be, so I can take some time and make things better.  I am at work now, and with only 4 days of work left, I find myself running out of things to do. So I decided to come here and waste some time. I can't get used to this though, I will soon be venturing out to search the job market for something small and part time to pay my few bills every month. If anyone knows of anything or has any suggestions, please let me know!   Maybe I will have some time to get back to my ranting and raving...we will see. A girl can dream.

      The clock ticks another minute past 7am, and I sit and ask myself�what the hell am I doing up this early on a Saturday morning? Then I remember it is theatre�children�s theatre to be exact, so why even ask such silly questions.  The cast of �No One Will Marry A Princess With A Tree Growing Out Of Her Head� will be performing this morning at the Barnes and Noble in Lancaster. God bless Publicity. The bookstore has advertised this mornings performance along with a �Prince and Princess Day� for the kids. Parents are encouraged to bring their children dressed as Princes and Princesses to watch us and participate in a parade around the store. Let me tell you how excited I am about this�  On another happy note, I recently auditioned for �Machinal� by Sophie Treadwell. It will be the AVC production following the children�s show I am working on now. It is centered on the story of a woman who cheats on and kills her husband (fun, fun, fun). It will be the department's workshop production, and the director, Kelly Williams, has been flown in from Hawaii to work on the show. The roles of the young woman, her husband, and her lover have been cast individually, and five additional ensemble cast members will play the remaining twenty-something characters to complete the show. I was cast as an ensemble member! I am really excited, this will be the first show I have worked on like this, and some old friends have been cast along with me�Benny Wills, Joseph Stevenson, Joaquin Alvarez, and Justin Greene. I think the show will be great fun, and have no doubt that with these hoodlums, there will be trouble to be had. That�s for sure!  Well, my actors should be showing up any minute, so I better get to doing my job. I hope everyone who reads this is well (all 3 of you that may or may not exist). Take care.

      It is only 10:30 in the morning and it has already been a long day. It is either the projects I am working on today or the Vicodin I am taking for my broken back that is making time last forever. I am taking a moment away from ID TheftBlock and other tasks at work to breathe. I thought I would invite you to join me.   A few friends have asked to be updated on the accident and the resulting wave of whatever it has created. To sum things up...the car will be paid off by the insurance and I am still unsure if there will be any leftover for a down payment on something new. I have also yet to be told I am no longer allowed to drive a vehicle in the great state of California. I thought at first they may not let me, but as of right now the only thing I am waiting for is the okay from my physician and the confidence that I will no longer be in the propensity to black out while driving. Yes, this was the second time it has happened, the first time being about two years ago. I was told it wouldn�t happen again, but alas, it has. I thank God my liver survived in its whole and that there were no horses involved this time around.  If anyone knows of a good dealership or contact through which I can find a great deal on a newer vehicle, please let me know. I make enough money to handle a car payment and the astronomical insurance payment that is bound to result from this mess, so let me know if anyone has any options for me.

      So it is now 11:00pm on a Sunday evening. I arrived here at my house about 30 minutes ago on my way home from Vegas this weekend. This is usually the time I run into almost every single one of my 'online buddies', but to my dismay not a one is currently online. Either I really am crazy, the bump on my head from my accident left more of a lasting impression then at first believed, or everyone else I know has some sort of a life. I bet more on the last of the options rather than the first two, but I can not say for sure.  Las Vegas was overall a fun and enjoyable trip. The traveling group consisted of me, Tony, Nicole, Josh, Bobb, Jeremy, Ryan, April, and a few others that I do not know and honestly can�t remember their names. We left Friday night and returned home Sunday evening. The original intention was to venture to Sin City in celebration of Tony�s 24th Birthday, but along with that we had fun getting into trouble while we were there. I am sure all who went will agree with me on that.  Anyways�not a lot to comment on at the moment but I thought I should write something. As hard as I try, I am not sure I am capable of writing in a �profound� manner. But nothing is around to try and stop me, so I might as well try, right?

      I know it has been a couple of days since my last post, for this I am eternally sorry. It has been a long couple of days filled with doctors appointments, interrogation, sleep, and thinking. After re-reading that last post, I may have sounded a little harsher than I wanted to come across as. There are people in this world I am unhappy with. I don�t think I differ from any other human being in this fact. I have been led (by others and by myself) to feel or think certain things and I want that time in my life to come to an end. After realizing what I as an individual have been through, I think I can consider myself old enough and responsible enough to take means and responsibility for all my own actions. I know I have not been through everything, and I openly admit that fact! I have, however, had my share of ups and downs and I feel that I have earned enough credibility and respect to have my own idea and opinion about certain things. If I am wrong in this assumption, please let me know!  I just wanted to put in writing a little explanation of my last entry and explain myself and where I am coming from a little further. Thank you to all that have signed my guestbook, and please feel free to sign again if the fancy strikes you! I will try and write again before my adventure to Vegas this weekend, so I will see the page again soon I am sure!  Just as an extra note: My Toyota Corolla has been officially pronounced dead. There will be no attempt to revive or restart the Corolla's heart. If you were one to ride within its prestigous walls, please join me in a moment of silence for this fallen soilder. Who knows how or when it will be replaced, but let us all thank God for automobile insurance! Okay, I think I am done.

      Enough about me�let's talk about others for a second. Just a second though, I promise.  Being sick has led to nothing but an unhealthy amount of time with nothing to do but lie on a broken back and think. So I thought and thought and thought. For me, thinking in the first place can lead to disaster. But I think I did a fairly good job at keeping the casualties down to a minimum this time around. I made the initial mistake of thinking about certain individuals that I really shouldn�t think about anymore. I started feeling sorry for myself, sick at the life I was living, and wishing to go back in time and make things as they once were. I was on this train of thought for a while, and then I realized�no wonder people say I needed to start this site. I have so much crap in this head of mine that I need to forget and let go. Why has it taken me so long to discover this? And may I please state for the record this discovery came without any outside aid of prescription drugs or otherwise!  There are certain things that I wish to bring up with these select individuals, but I feel this is not the correct forum to do so in. I just want to express the relief and joy I feel at this time. I am taking the power away from �the people� as a public mass to make me happy or unhappy. That is really the end of it.  I will also tack onto the end how completely upset I am that I am almost 23 years of age and have yet to be even remotely swept off my feet. I am bitter about this on many levels.  Woo. Okay. See, I promised it would be just a second!!

      I got into a car accident Wednesday morning on the way to work. I woke up sometime Friday afternoon with no idea what was going on. Let me fill everyone in on what I happen to know thus far.  My mom, older sister Jamie and I were at the hospital till late Friday morning. Evidently my mom wasn�t even informed of the accident till 2 or 3 late Wednesday afternoon. At first I thought there was something wrong with this, but the more I thought about it I realized I was in a safe place, getting my medication and being taken care of. Those three things I have nothing wrong with. I am afraid I am not sure I remember anything till late Friday afternoon, so either way; we are good on all fronts.  Having the advantage of being me, I kind of know what is going on in said body. The top of my left thigh is sparsely covered in bruises and somehow my left eye looks as if someone has beat it in. Along with the bruising on the eye, there is a 3 inch gash right under my left eyebrow. How any of this happened, I am still unsure. My mother and I have a meeting with the police officers handling the case on Monday, and hopefully we can get some questions answered. I do know for sure that my car will be no more, and according to what we uncover with the police on Monday, we will find out if I can even look into getting another one. Boy is it great to be me right now!  I will keep everyone up to speed on the happenings and hopefully, I have lived my life well enough to this point to hope for some gentle relief in the happenings to come. I would appreciate anyone�s wishes or prayers. Thanks everyone, you know how to get a hold of me if you need�looks as if I will have plenty of time nowadays!

      I woke up late this morning�again. I got to work just in time for a party that I had planned. It was a good thing I put someone else in charge of brining the cake. After the party, I sat at my desk, starring blankly at the screen in front of me. I was there for about 45 minutes, starring�blankly. Evidently the �blank stare� is something not everyone can do well. I base this assumption on the fact that my training partner came up behind me and complimented me on my �blank stare�. She said, and I quote, �I wish I starred at my screen that well, you actually look like you could be working on something.�  I took this as a sign.  I contemplated my partner�s musings for pretty much the rest of the afternoon. Should I feel good�should I take it as a compliment? Maybe I should feel bad, guilty or something for not actually working while I was at work. I most likely shouldn�t even give it a second thought. Should I?   From the day I started my job (January 22, 2002), if I pieced all the moments of �blank stare� together, I would have approximately 3.4 days of total and complete, compacted, uninterrupted �blank stare�. And even a more disturbing thought�imagine what stupid things I must have been thinking about while lost in these �blank stare� fits. I am a self-diagnosed thinker-way-to-mucher (yes, I made that up), and I can only imagine the thoughts that may have once crossed my mind. Conjuring up that thought will give me nightmares for days, I just know it. Thinking about thoughts I conjure�I need help.  I want to work on this�this�problem. Disease? Sickness? Disorder? Whatever it is, I need to stop reading into things that may not even be there, I need to stop assuming anything (because to   assume   is to make an   ass   out of   u   and   me  ), and I need to stop trying to figure out what people are thinking. I figure none of that really matters in the end. What you know is what you know.  I think too much. I�m working on that.

      So it is a little past 6am on Monday morning and I am already at work. I didn't actually sleep at all last night. Not sleeping is the norm for me, unfortunately. Whenever I share this with people, I get stormed with suggestions and remedies that I, of course, have never heard before (please note my sarcasm). Everything from warm milk to meletonin supplements, I have heard AND tried most of them.   I personally have come to realize that there is nothing wrong with my body, physically at least, that is keeping me from the great land of slumber. It is something else, something psychological. I have yet to pin point the reason, thought, or demon that is the cause behind my insomnia�but I hope to not only find it, but come to grips with it.  I will let you know.

      As of late, more and more friends have been starting one of these "blog" things. True to form, I of course wanted to join the bandwagon. I am not quite sure what form or shape this may take, but I hope to benefit someone along the way, if not only myself. Selfishness never really suited me in the past, but lets see if it fits.

      Chris got on my case last night that it had been a while since I posted anything. So I make this post is his dedication�I hope this does the trick.  So let�s see�what�s going on? Same old crap, different day I suppose. I am working on the job situation, and I even have a couple leads! Telephone banker, Customer Service Rep, and I�m even applying to work on a cruise ship! I, of course, will let you know what comes of it. I was pondering the employment thing at rehearsal yesterday and I realized�I really love theatre. I don�t just like it, or watch it, or work it, I honest-to-God love theatre. I need to find someone or someplace that will pay me to do what I love. Is this possible? Is this too much to ask? I am finding out that here in the Antelope Valley that it is not possible. So I will sit and cry, work shows in my free time, and eventually get over it. Story of my life�.  Speaking of which, �Machinal� is coming to an AVC Black Box near you! Performance dates will be: Thursday May 8th 8pm Friday May 9th 8pm Saturday May 10th 8pm Sunday May 11th 2pm Friday May 16th 8pm Saturday May 17th 8pm It is going to be a great show!!! It is honestly the most fun and interesting show I have worked on to date, or at least acted in to date. I hope that all can get a chance to come and see it. For those out of the area, here is the  urlLink AVC Website  to get the address and any other information you can find.  Well, I am off to find a job. Mom will be here in 20 to pick me up�she loves me. I need to work on my attitude with her. I need to work on my attitude period. Oh well�tangent I do not have time to take you on. Till the next post!

      I apologize for not getting around to writing sooner than five days from my last post. I have recently not been in the best spirits to write, but I am feeling much better today. I did not get to sleep last night till after 6am. I slept in too late because of it. I jumped out of bed at 3:57pm and realized my mom would soon be at my house to pick me up and take me to rehearsal at 4. I ran downstairs and told my roommate to let my mom in, then ran back upstairs to jump in the shower.  Anyway I got to rehearsal and all was well. It was great because it worked out that after rehearsal I got to spend some time hanging out with my friend Steve. The great amount of sleep, a good rehearsal, and good times with Steve made it a great day.  I woke up hoping to buy some tickets to a Counting Crows concert. My beautiful friend Clare enlightened me that they will be playing a couple of shows in the LA area in a few months. I know there will be some of you that think or even yell out loud �Why in the hell would she want to see those whining men?� Well to answer those cries�I don�t feel I have to tell you, just know that they touch me and are my favorite band. My music tastes run in so many different directions, I feel it would be pointless to try and explain.  I looked into the concert and low and behold�the concert is in Irvine on MY BIRTHDAY! For those of you that are unaware, my birthday is July 18th and I will be 23 years of age. And for those of you who were unaware, this would be the perfect time to write it down and make plans to get me something great. So yes, I looked into getting the tickets, and both shows I could have bought tickets for were �sold out�. But my plans haven�t changed�I will see one of the shows and I will love it. I will do my best to make it happen.  I am also excited that my friend Sevag will fly into LA tomorrow. Hopefully I will see him sometime before the weekend. He is coming home from Air Force school in Texas. He will be in LA for 15 days then he is going to Florida for his first assignment. We will see how things pan out.  To keep all informed�I am still looking for a job, looking for a car, working on �Machinal� at the college, and trying to regain my life. I will keep you informed of any updates.

      I woke up this morning...I mean this afternoon at 11:30am. I got up and took a shower, got ready, and on my way downstairs I slipped and landed on my right foot. It was a nasty fall at the top of the stairs. I had one of those seconds in my head that last forever: I imagined rolling all the way down the staircase and either becoming dead or having to be rushed to the hospital. Of course it is just a sprained foot, but lots more happened in my head and it was really scary. Needless to say my foot hurts like a (you fill in this blank) and my theatre rehearsal this evening was really hard and painful.   Now that I think back, it must not have been too hard because after rehearsal I went to Sharkey's and then to La Rue with Jolly. It was �dollar drink night� at La Rue. I ran into some friends I haven�t seen in a while; Sean, Qumar and Brent. Before that, at Sharkey's, my ex Jonathan happens to show up with his girlfriend. It became one of those "let�s conveniently not see each other so we won�t have to have any awkward conversation" situations. Oh well.  I have had a spot of sunshine in my unemployed car-less existence. His name is  urlLink Sevag.  My connection with Sevag is a really long story�and I am hoping that it will have a great ending. I will keep you informed.  It is almost 2am and I think I will actually be heading off to bed. Traci? Bed? I know it is odd, but get used to it, I have. I love all of you that read this. You know who you are�obviously�because you are reading this.

      Rejoice! Rejoice! The children�s play is over! We had a kick-butt cast party last night. There wasn�t a whole lot of people there, and the real party didn�t start until the lead of the show, Kelly (a 14 year-old), left with her parents. Parties, I believe, are best described in keywords�such as: cake, sushi, dancing, Sir Mix-A-Lot, Smirnoff, Corona, Daiquiris, Scott�s House, nicotine, and loud music.  Now that I am not stressing over the job of being a stage manager, I can focus on my life again. I need to get a job and then I need to get a car. I am also rehearsing �Machinal� at the college. I will be playing 3 different roles and then some; bit parts and walk-ons and such. It is going to be a really great show!   So I have had a lot of time to think lately. I know�big surprise. Since I spend so much time RIDING in cars rather than DRIVING them�one�s mind tends to wander. I have decided that I am not educated enough. I have so many friends that quote authors, bands, and playwrights. I know what I talk about, I can relate to what they are saying and respond in an intelligent manner, but I can�t start the conversation myself. I find this to be a problem and short coming on my part. I need to be able to keep up with my peers and understand, comprehend, and relate to a lot more of what they say and think!  With this thought running through my mind, I think about maybe going back to school. Educating myself and rounding out my personality. I currently pay no rent, have no car or insurance payment, and will only have to work part time to cover the other bills I have every month. Time wise I could work it out�but then the question is raised of how I will pay for it. It is times like these that I wish there was someone to make the decisions and tell me what to do and also be there to make sure everything works.  Student aide would be a logical choice�although they maybe a little upset with me that I haven�t started paying what I already owe them yet. And what would I do if I went to a University out of town? This brings up so many MORE things to think about. It is easier not to, but alas�that is not a choice as well.  I will stay here and wallow in my state of confusion for a while longer and let you be on your way.

      Picture it. Me.  -Unemployed -Happy to not be working where I was -Hopeful to find a new job I will like -Without a car -Sad that I have to be dependant on others to get me places -Not happy being single -Sad that I am not happy being single, I should be happy  -Love being back in theatre -Sad that I am not getting paid for working the theatre I love -Very upset at my pancreas and other random bodily organs -Wondering what life will bring me next  I am a list person. I wanted to list some current feelings and problems in hopes of getting them out and taken care of. This is supposedly healthy. Either I will be better or more people will make fun of me. We will find out.   There are a couple possibilities for new jobs already. Cross your fingers for me. If anyone needs a cute redheaded assistant, just let me know. I will try and find one.

      Is it just me, or is �thinking� counter-productive at times? I am sitting here at Deluxe, in my now empty desk. I have spent the morning signing papers and packing my stuff into boxes. It is doing monotonous tasks such as these that have led my mind to do nothing but think. This is a crime I am guilty of more than not. Thinking. Thinking too much. Thinking of things that will never happen too much. Oh well. God save the �King�.  On a completely different note, I was chatting with my buddy Chris last night, and it seems that he has found a connection of sorts with a nice young lady. Lets talk about this guy for a minute. The great thing about Chris is�well�that he is Chris. His personality is a little hard to read at first (this goes back to the fact that I was probably thinking about it too much at the time). He is really special in my eyes�being a return LDS Missionary, having good strong values and ideas, living with his dad on their own, and still being able to love TOOL. It is really hard, at least it has been for me, to describe a person and use LDS and TOOL in the same sentence without one negating the other. Special I tell you! I just wanted to write a blurb that I know even in my trials, that it is great to hear that things are going well for my friends. With Chris and �the 18 year old� as to which she is referred, he deserves to be happy and for things to work out. Chris was the one who originally turned me onto this BLOG thing. Check out his Blog here,  urlLink  SUPER DOOPER FLOOPIE FLAKES.   Special I tell you! Good luck Chris!  We are in �Hell Week� rehearsals for �No One Will Marry a Princess with a Tree Growing Out of Her Head.� Our rehearsals have now stretched to about 5 hours in length at the performing arts center. It is really great to be out of the small black box theatre at the college, but I think the growth of the space has scared my actors just a bit. We set sound cues yesterday and will spend most of today setting light cues. These are the joyous, fun, and exciting times of running theatre. I am sure all that can relate will agree with me. They will either agree with me or knock me in the head and tell me I am crazy. I may lean more towards the later than the first. Oh well.  Over all, the show is going good. The thing with live stage shows (I may actually get theatre people to agree with me on this), is that during the last week of rehearsal there is a defining moment where the director and those working with him see the cast �click� into the show. They �click� into their characters, into their setting, and they �click� with each other onstage. This moment is the point where the director (and stage manager, me) are convinced that it will be a good show and that things will, despite any opposition, work for the best. The timing of this moment is different for every cast. It has been different for every show I have ever worked on, but eventually the �click� does happen. To make this already long story shorter, we are still looking for this moment with the cast of �Princess Tree Head�.   I wrote quite a bit this go-around. I must unfortunately get myself back to packing�and thinking, dammit. He we go again�

      I have been a mess of emotions lately. I am not sure I like that.   I have prided myself on the fact that Traci was different from other women. I hold a lot of personality traits that make it easy for me to be "one of the guys" in a metaphorical sense of course. I love guys with too much of myself to ever be not womanish in the attraction sense. I am pretty sure I still hold the title of "Straightest Girl in America." If this has changed, someone please let me know.  But here is the rub...I have a hard time getting along with other girls. There are, of course, the ones I love and I could not live without. Along with those select few are also the ones I have to work and spend time with under no choice of my own, all I chose was a little duress actually; retired high school cheerleaders, drama queens, melodramatic waifs, etc. But with these emotions and thoughts I feel I am getting closer and closer to...well...what I hate; an over-emotional, over-analytical, over-presumptuous woman.  With the leaving of the training job, stage managing children�s theatre, and being cast in an adult drama production that will immediately follow�I have a bit to think about. Add to that mix being single and not liking it, having no automobile, spending a little too much time with my mother who has been gracious enough to take me where I need to go, and the fact that I am 22 and have no concrete idea of what I am doing with my life.  My family is great. My friends are wonderful even though they seem to be few and I never see them. I do have lots of blessings I am thankful for, but it is one of those times when the clouds seem to reign and overcome all sunshine. I think I should simply get another tattoo. That always makes me feel better. Something to save for I guess.

      So here we are�another entry. I have not even really thought about what I should write, but I am going to just go and see what happens.  The foremost thought on my mind at the moment is my love life. Rob came up and spent most of the weekend with me. We got along really well, had good conversation, I made dinner (note to self: not everyone likes Good Goat burritos), and we watched a few movies (The Transporter on video and Matrix Reloaded at the theatre). The surprise he brought me was a real rose covered in 24K gold. Wow. Bottom line�he is a really great person, we get along swell and he is really (and I mean really) nice. If given enough time and attention I think the relationship would definitely have the potential to bloom. But with things the way they are now, with the distance, the fact that he is a hard working man, and the fact that I am NOT working (or driving for that matter) will put a damper on the time and attention. The great news is I have made a really good friend. But as of right now, judging on the conversations we have had on the subject, it is going to mutually stay just that. Good Friends, and although there may be a possibility for more, I am really happy with finding that :) I have no further dates planned�with anyone that is�which brings me back to where I started. Woo Hoo for me!  Another subject�can you guess�is the employment problem. I am working on finishing this test for  urlLink United Rentals . It is called a �Caliper Profile� and it is designed basically to discover what kind of work ethic I have and coincidently what kind of employee I would be. I am not worried about the results, but I should have faxed it to them Friday and here it is Monday. I should get to finishing it I think. It is a really good job and a really good opportunity, and I really need to start working hard on getting it.  Come one, come all to the  urlLink In-N-Out  Company Family Picnic! This is an annual occasion with my family. Seeing as though my father worked for the  urlLink In-N-Out  company for over 30 years, my family has attended since I was a baby. Almost all the �high ups� know who we are, and most of my siblings still work for the company. The picnic will be at  urlLink Knott�s Berry Farm  again this year. It has changed locations a couple times, but has been there for the last 3 years or so. The day will include free In-N-Out grub plus nachos, popcorn, cotton candy and all that jazz. After we eat we get the park to ourselves for a couple hours. It should be a fun time, and I get to spend some quality time with my family.   I think that is good for now. Of course I will be back�eventually�  Do me a favor�Smile :)

      It has been quite a few days since my last blog post. I really don�t have an explanation or even a good reason. Just didn�t do it. But I am back! Yee haw�woo hoo! Let�s catch up, shall we? Where to start, where to start�  �Machinal� ended last weekend and I have very mixed emotions on the subject. It was a great, fun, learning, expanding experience. But it left me so tired. It wouldn�t have been the show it was without Kelly Williams, our director. She totally kicked ass and, as directors go, she totally let us kick ass. The opportunity to play multiple roles in an expressionist show, a theatre style that the valley was unfamiliar with, truly tested me and helped me grow as an actor. I feel I am better for it, and I will not forget the experience.  Rehearsals have already begun for �Jesus Christ Superstar�. At the rehearsal tonight we will be starting �The Firm�. It is a video exercise series incorporating weights and steps. Let me tell you how excited I am. I�m not. But it will be good to move and workout again. I haven�t done anything of the sort since the accident, I will let you know how it goes. I am very excited about the aspects of the show; the set (a 40 degree rake encompassing the whole stage), the costumes (ala �The Matrix�), the addition of video into the theatre setting (more to come on this later), and the cast (people I have worked with in the past and others I have not).  I went on an interview yesterday with  urlLink United Rental . I applied for a counter/customer service position; full time, good pay, and benefits will be included. I think it went rather well. I have to take a test and fax it into them, and following that I will be given a call next week. Cross your fingers! And if you don�t cross them for that, cross your fingers for an interview I will be taking next week at  urlLink Edwards AF Base . I am still not quite sure what the position is, but it pays A LOT of money.  Let�s see�what else? Oh yes, now I remember. Robbie :) He will be coming up to visit again from Rancho Palos Verdes on Saturday. I am really really excited. I think I am going to make dinner and we are going to watch a video here at my place. I talked to him on the phone last night and he told me he is bringing a surprise. He wouldn�t tell me what it is, and the only hint I could get out of him was that it was �gold� in color. So now I am lost and I am determined to not think about it, otherwise it will drive me crazy. I think I may like him, and more surprisingly, I think he may like me. We will see what happens this weekend :)  I think that is it for now. I will try and keep this more up to date. Oh, before I go, I want to congratulate my buddy  urlLink Chris  on his  urlLink 'news' . Way to go Chris! Keep us up to date on your status at the paper!   Till then, bon jour mon amie!

      For the first time in a couple weeks I have an evening free from rehearsal. �Machinal� is almost finished, and we have already started on �Jesus Christ Superstar�. It will be really exciting. You know what else will be exciting? When I get to the point where I have something else to be excited about besides theatre�an exciting job, or maybe an exciting boy. Oh well. There is more to life. THERE IS MORE TO LIFE.  So I have been chatting with a new friend. I know, I am full of new friends, but this one is special. Robbie was kind enough to pick me out of the proverbial �online crowd� and say hi. I really need to stop meeting guys this way, but I am afraid it is habit. I think it will end when I meet the man to keep me from it�hopefully he exists. A girl can dream. Back to Robbie though�he will be coming to see �Machinal� on Saturday and then we will go out afterwards. I am very self-conscious about what he will think when he meets me. Appearance wise, I mean. He says not to worry but I do and I will till after Saturday. I am crazy�and I have to constantly remind myself� THERE IS MORE TO LIFE.  Update on other things; babies are all good and healthy, took a typing test at Countrywide Home Loans this morning and passed, they will be calling in a week or two to set up a second interview, my license has been officially suspended so no driving, and I am finding it harder and harder to get to sleep.   I will write more later. Just a couple thoughts I wanted to get down. Thanks again to all those who read this�this�pathetic cry for attention. I am pretty sure that is what it is. :)

      Two entries in one day�I know�amazing.  Baby Westley was born this morning a little after 6:30 am. His size was good, 6 lbs 2 ounces (exactly the weight Felicity was on Monday) and he is doing good! The only trouble they are running up against is that he has not quite got the sucking and swallowing down on his own yet and his digestive tract isn't quite developed yet. He will probably be admitted to the hospital until the problem is resolved. But otherwise he is the newest addition to our family!  I was lying in bed last night (this morning) pondering many a thing. My mind wandered to my friend Tyler. He and I go quite a ways back. Tyler was my first boyfriend and we were together a year and a half. It has been years since we have had time to catch up, but we seem to find the time recently. We hang out, talk and what not, and I honestly have no idea what is going on. We will see what happens.  I thought about Chad as well. Hi Chad! I know he reads this and is disappointed that he does not make the ranks. But he does�boy does he! Just not real open to talking about it�I think he understands. It is always great to see him, hang out, talk and what not. hehehe  Well, if that wasn�t cryptic enough for you all, I will try and think of something much more mysterious for the next entry. Otherwise things are going good. If you haven�t seen them already�I can give anyone who is interested the dates and times for my show at the college. It is really, really good! I recommend coming to see it, even if I was not in it I would. It�s wonderfully acted and directed. I am not sure I can plug this anymore, but I will try.  Talk to you later!

      Where to start, where to start�  Good News! Cinco de Mayo not only brought freedom to Mexico, but this year it brought my new niece Felicity Anne as well! All 6 lbs 2 ounces, 19 inches of her! She is the first child of my little sister  urlLink Leslie  and her husband  urlLink Zach.  She came two weeks early, and we were very happy to see her. Congratulations guys!  Speaking of babies�there is another one on the way. My mom received a phone call this morning around 3 am from my brother  urlLink Corey  up in Idaho. His wife  urlLink Jenna  was expecting baby Westley in June, but he has also decided to come a bit early. Westley is quite a bit early, but the last ultrasound  urlLink Jenna  had showed the baby to be round about 6 lbs already. His size will be okay for a premature birth, the question will lie in the internal organs, the lungs especially and if they have had enough time to develop.  urlLink Jenna  is in labor this very minute up in Idaho, and my mother has a flight booked for tomorrow morning. I hope and pray all will turn out well and yet another gorgeous baby will bless our ever growing family.   On more of a personal note, �Machinal� performed tonight for the first time in front of an audience. It went really well! I did well, the cast did well, and it was very well accepted by the crowd. It was a preview show, and only two classes of theatre students were invited to attend. Technically we don�t open with a real, ticket buying audience till tomorrow, but it was an audience just the same. It was great for the first show to go well.  More personal good news�I have already been cast in another show. The college�s next production will be �Jesus Christ Superstar�. I auditioned and have been cast as one of the evil priests (one of the Pharisees for those of you who are biblically literate). It is an ensemble role, but just a step above chorus. I am really excited! The director, Mark, has some very different and very interesting visions of the show. It will be a fun experience to participate in.  No job found yet, still looking. I can�t seem to nail anything down. I continue to try though, and again, if anyone knows of anything please let me know. As far as the car situation goes, I received a letter from the DMV letting me know my license has been suspended. It will remain so till I furnish the DMV with proof that I no longer have the medical problems that led to my accident. At this point, even if I could afford a car I would not be able to drive it. Everything happens for a reason�I just have to keep telling myself that.  That�s about it for now. I will try my hardest to write more. I know� promises�promises�but I really will try. I will talk/see/chat with you later!

      I think I have done it...found a job! It was a miracle, but I was offered two jobs this week. The first was a position as the �Base Operator� at Edwards AF Base. It pays a whole lot of money, has great benefits, but unfortunately is a 45 minute drive from my house. I, being without a license or a vehicle, would have trouble getting to work on a daily basis. At first I was not going to let this bother me and take the job and bust my ass to get there. But then Thursday came�accompanied by a phone call from United Rental. They too offered me a position, for United I would be a �counter help / receptionist / customer service� person. United is located in Lancaster, much closer than the Base. I have yet to tell Edwards, but I will be taking the position at United. It pays less, but it will come with benefits and perks, as well as an opportunity to work with men in the construction business�a good thing on so many levels. They have a stipulation�they do not want to hire drug-ee�s�so I took my drug test this afternoon and should be to work sometime next week.  Things are going really well with Rob. I have talked about him before, and I was thinking that we wouldn�t be more than friends. My hesitation for more came from different motivations; he lives in Rancho Palos Verdes (two hours away from humble Palmdale), I didn�t feel I was in a position to take on a relationship at the moment (un-licensed, un-employed, and un-supporting myself), and to boot I was really�really�nervous. This was all before this last weekend. Rob, the gentleman that he is, drove up here to see me again. We talked about us, and he left with me standing by the above listed ideas. Over the week I did nothing but think about it. After more talking with the sweetie�I have come to the decision to give him a try. I can already tell that he is the type that will be willing to help and work around being so far apart. We both admit and realize that distance will be a hindrance, but I think he is definitely worth trying to make it work. I will be spending more time with him this weekend, and as far as I know he will be showing me around PV and showing me a good time in LA. I have made the decision to focus time on Rob, not to see anyone else, and see where being with him will take me. A lot of this is up to him, so depending on if he changes his mind, things may change, but my mind is set.  Two of the things I felt I have had the biggest trouble with in life now seem to be resolving themselves. It is absolutely amazing to me the way things work out at times. I need to take some time and work on my health and such to get my license back. My friend Steve has made me promise that when the time comes for me to get a vehicle, I will either buy his Jetta or he will accompany me to purchase said vehicle. Being a salesman himself as well as being car-savvy, I would appreciate the help and advice. Rob has also mentioned helping out with the project�he drives a really nice Lancer�so I may take his advice too :)  I leave with a smile�hope you have one too :)

      So here we are�the beginning of another week. I am hoping that this week will bring a job, an income, and some resolution to some questions I have been pondering. I realize that this blog has become nothing more than an update resource of my life and times. When I started this thing, I meant it to be an outlet where I could rant and rave and be funny. I am failing�I feel�miserably at that. I gave this serious thought. I have realized that I honestly haven�t had the time, the energy, or the mind frame to dedicate to such ranting and raving. I am funny looking so I suppose that takes care of the being funny part. Any who�I am going to make an effort to get back to my critical thinking, not in that annoying obsessive way, but in that witty intelligent way.  Till that time comes�on with the update-ness. I went to two interviews last week. On Thursday I interviewed with Unisys at  urlLink Edwards AF Base . The position interviewed for was the �Base Operator�. I would talk to people from around the world looking for people and phone numbers on the base. The interview went well, I was called the day after and they said they felt it went really well too. They are currently doing a background check, so hopefully those felonies back in �97 won�t turn them off. The check can take up to 5 days, so we will see.  I was called Friday morning and the district manager from at  urlLink United Rental  wanted to have a second interview with me. I had taken a test and faxed it to them earlier in the week, and I guess I did really well on it. He kept mentioning how smart I was during the interview, I took it as a good sign. I left and he told me they were considering me and one other person and that I should know by today (Monday). Sitting in anticipation I am. Cross your fingers.  Rob came up again on Saturday. We talked and he had a chance to meet Steve and Kramer. Boy was that an experience�but what can I say�the boys are a riot. Rob and I had some serious discussion. I am still in a state of confusion on the whole situation�one of the questions I hope this week will bring resolution to. Also had a chance to meet a cool guy from New York, Brooklyn to be more specific. His name is Eddie and he works at a recording studio in Studio City. He is a great guy, hope to get to know him better.  Well, I think that is it for right now. I am all of a sudden tired�think I will lay down.  :) SMILE

      Well, yet another weekend with no real progress made in any facet of my life. I have worked all week, even on Friday, the Fourth of July. They also asked me to work on Saturday. At first, I was kind of sad to be working so much. Then I realized that I will have 80 hours of regular wages and almost 30 hours of overtime on my next paycheck. I really don�t see anything wrong with that :)   Rob came up last night. He brought a movie, we had some Taco Bell. There was no longer a connection like there was before. He made it obvious that he was not interested in going any further with me. With the events as they are, all my questions have been answered�finally. I no longer need to stress over it.  I have been thinking about Jason more and more. He only lives 45 minutes from me, but in the position I currently find myself in, that is a really really long way to go. We have so much in common, think a lot alike. I talk to him everyday on the phone, and I am not sure what, when, or if things will happen with him. A girl can dream :)  My mom, my brother Corey, his wife Jenna, and their baby Westley have all officially moved into a townhouse right down the street from me. All of my siblings, save my sister Jamie, is now located here in the Antelope Valley. It is exciting, and a little overwhelming all at the same time. It is great that they are here and we are close, but at times I wish they weren�t. It�s a Catch 22 I guess.  I am working and doing Jesus Christ Superstar. The show is still a little rough�which worries me a little bit. We move from the college Black box theatre to the Lancaster Performing Arts Center�to the Main Stage. Hopefully things will begin to click and form into the show it should be. I know it will be a great something to watch, but there is a certain element that we as actors are missing onstage�I am sure some know what I am talking about. Oh well. Onward!  I miss having good friends. Slowly but surely, I find myself losing people who were once close to me. I figure a lot of this has to do with the fact that I can no longer bring myself to them�not having my own car and all. Then I realize, what kind of friends are they in the first place that in my time of need, they distance themselves and do not make an effort to see me rather than just the other way around. Reality is at times a hard pill to swallow, but I kind of see how it is at the moment.  Generally, all is well. Please, all who read�if any�feel free to email or comment at will. I would love to hear from you. Thanks :)

      It seems it has been forever. The last time I wrote an entry, well�.needless to say is was a couple weeks ago. I am going to try and catch up. As I have mentioned before, I am a list person, so I best think and write my thoughts as such�a list that is.   1. It is now the beginning of my fourth week at  urlLink United Rentals . I work 7am to about 6pm, long days. The days move pretty quickly, so it isn�t bad at all. I make $10 an hour, so overtime will be really nice! I got my first paycheck this last Friday, and damn does it feel good. Too bad it is practically already spent�catching up on things I haven�t paid since I have been out of work at the beginning of April. Ah well.  2. The situation with Rob�I have seen him for about 5 weekends in a row now. We have been pretty much exclusive. We had a chat the other day, as I had questioned why we weren�t together if we weren�t seeing anyone else. End of a long story�he will be taking some time to think, get his thoughts together. He doesn�t want to commit to a relationship and feels that he would be passing up the opportunity to meet someone else. So I am leaving it at that. He knows I will always be here to talk to, and he calls daily which is wonderful, but I have put a hold to what I was going for originally with him. Going to wait to see how things pan out I suppose.  3. I want to publicly thank the wonderful Jason Brown for the awesome CD�s that he burned and brought me on Sunday. I think this may be the first time I have introduced the lad, but I think and hope to be writing a bit more about him. He is a friend from Northridge, works as a computer programmer for a banking institution down that ways, and he and I seem to have tons in common. He unfortunately is in a relationship, well a type of relationship at the moment. Yet more patience on my part�going to hang around as a friend, one of my best capacities ever I admit, but I think it may be time for something more for Traci. Stay tuned to see how things with Jason turn.  4. I now want to publicly apologize to Steve and Melissa. Things are rough for me and Steve. There was a point that I wanted to explore more than our friendship, but after a serious talk, I realized (not only was he not interested in exploring) that we were much better off as friends. I considered us good friends at that. While things were rough with Rob and I, things seemed to be going excellent for Steve and his beautiful girlfriend Melissa. End of a long story�I partook of some alcohol (which Steve quickly pointed out was of my own volition and can not be claimed as a defense, even in the State of California system of law) and because of it didn�t take the time to think of what I was saying before I said things. My complete bad�I admit this. I made a statement at a party, the first time I met Melissa in fact, that offended her. To Melissa, I hope you read this, I had some meaning behind what I said, and I am sorry I did not know better and phrase what I was trying to say in a better way. I hope to have the opportunity to regain the respect from both you and Steve that I lost in my first impression. I have never seen Steve be as happy, as excited, and as school-boyish as he is when he talks about you. I saw this and it made me so happy that he was happy, something he has been waiting for�perfection. Because of the times I was going through, I didn�t give the two of you the congrats you deserved. I apologize. That night at the party, the two of you did nothing but make sense. Unfortunately all I did has hurt both of you, and as a result I have lost the respect I had from Steve, a good friend I talked with, and with his Steve-ness seemed to make things a little better. I have talked with him, and I hope this strengthens all I told him. I hope to be able to gain back some of the respect that I have lost�from both of you.  5. I invite everyone to the premiere of �Jesus Christ Superstar�. Funny thing, it opens on my birthday July 18th. It will be an awesome show�Jerusalem Meets the Matrix. Show times are: Friday July 18th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Saturday July 19th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Sunday July 20th, 2:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Friday July 25th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Saturday July 26th, 8:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center Sunday July 27th, 2:00pm, Lancaster Performing Arts Center  I think that is it at this juncture. I will write more. I promise. Especially you  urlLink Chris , Mr. �I have a cool new Blog and I am going to give Traci a hard time because she doesn�t even write in hers anymore.� Guess I will show him!

      Big news kids....great big news!!!  For the time being...I am no longer single. Not necessarily for the time being, but you know what I mean. Or maybe you don't. Either way, Brenden has sweeped me off my feet, shared a sunset with me, and well, other things that I will not mention.   Other than that, life in my new apartment is really really great!   Thats all for now. I am hungry.   Thanks, and smile. :)

      Well�here we are�another week come and gone. Can you believe it is almost September already? I cant wait, I love the holidays. Boy do I have good news! Two great and wonderful things happened within the last week and I want to tell you all about them.   First things first�I was approved for my own apartment! I go on Sunday to sign papers, get keys, and give them all my money! Even though it will leave me broke and a wee bit on the wanting side, it will all be for the best, I know it. I will be living in the Mountain Shadows apartments in Palmdale. I have never lived by myself before, we will see how that works out. I have no furniture, but we will see how that works out. I have no license or transportation yet either, we will see how that works out.  Second wonderment is a gentleman by the name of Brenden. We spent a couple days together and, I don�t know� there may be something there. I hope so, because don�t tell anyone, but I kinda like him. There was wonderful conversation and wonderful company. There are many things about him that amaze and impress me. We went book shopping, played pool, had some Crazy Otto�s�got to know each other. I bought him a book, so he owes me a favor�hehehe.  I don�t have much time, but I wanted to get the good news out. Write at you later.

      It seems that my blog has been getting more visitors than before, and here I am going over a month without an entry. Shame on me. Once I get into how wonderful the last month has been, I am sure I might win just a wee bit of your understanding, and maybe even (hopefully) some sympathy.  Run down�I will try and keep this to the immediately need to know information.  My living situation has been in turmoil. As most of you know, I was house sitting a huge 4-bedroom house with my good friend Josh and his fiancee Christina. The gentleman we were house sitting for was not scheduled to arrive back till sometime at the end of the year, being a Marine stationed over seas. One fine Monday afternoon I come home from work to find Josh and Christina reading over an email from the gentleman�s brother. The so called Gentleman was going to be home that Friday, and he wanted his house clear and empty by the time he got there. That left me 3 days to pack and move�to my mother�s couch. There I have been for about 4 weeks and I am praying that the applications I have put out for an apartment will go through. I am stressing at the moment over needing a co-signer. My mom has told me she will consider helping out, but on my credit alone, the app wont fly. Not that living with my mom, my brother, his wife, and their son isn�t healthy. It�s killing me! We will see what happens.  I am still working at United Rentals. I rent construction equipment. I have issues with the people I work with. They have changed my schedule�I now work Thursday through Monday and I have Tuesday and Wednesday off. Being low man on the totem sucks ass. That�s all I am going to say about that at the moment.  Speaking of things that suck ass�Traci is still single. Don�t get me wrong, I am having a ball having fun. I have been going out on dates and meeting new people, but still�I am waiting for that �click� to happen. In the beginning I was looking for it, searching for it�was doing nothing but making myself depressed. I am okay now with going with the flow and letting the �click� find me. I have had sparks�boy were there sparks. And I have also made a couple bad choices�but I think I am a better person for it, I know better now, that�s for sure�and all this within the last month. Amazing.   I have had the thought lately about going back to school. As soon as someone out there discovers how the hell I can support myself and still get a degree in Theatre will you please let me know. Dammit.  Trying to lose weight. Yeah�not working.  I turned 23. My birthday came on July 18th and left without so much as a whistle. I worked that day, 9 and � hours without a lunch, and then went straight to the theatre for opening night of �Jesus Christ Superstar�. Even though my day was sort of a tragedy, the show went off as a success. Thank you to Chad, Jason, and Robert as well as all my friends who were able to make it out to see it. I hope it was worth it, and on a personal note, I really hope my 24th birthday will be better than my 23rd.  I need a place to live!  I can�t stop saying �ten-four�. I say it constantly at work�and I can�t stop. It�s like the whole �sir� thing. It is becoming habit and I don�t think I like it. When I need to say �yes���ten-four� comes out instead. Someone help me, please!  I hope I get a chance to hang out with Chris soon. I must apologize to him�he was the one that started me on this blog thing and it is me that let it slide for over a month. Sorry Chris. BTW he is quite the published writer  urlLink check this dude out   The Metrolink is cool. A definite way to get to LA without a vehicle. Thank you to Jason for this discovery. Thank you to Jason for the wonderful weekend. That�s all I wish to say about that (hehehe).  I am getting out of debt. Oh, I am still there no doubt�but the path is a little clearer now and the light in the distance is growing brighter bi-monthly.  That�s all for now kids.

      I am just so freaking happy. I look at past entries, and I am amazed how much things have changed for me...since getting my own place, since  urlLink Brenden ...it's amazing.   I am just so freaking happy.

      It was a fun fun fun day at work today.  Strike that. Reverse it.  I am over at my mom's tonight where the family is congregating for dinner�all but my brother Corey, his wife and child. I being in the position to utilize my mother�s computer jumped on the prospect. So here I am. I don�t have a whole lot to write, but I will attempt to keep it interesting.  I went to dinner Wednesday night with  urlLink Brenden  and some of his friends. To be honest, I was very nervous. We went to dinner at a restaurant they frequent, and then we went to the UCLA dorms and played pool till the wee hours of the morning. I wanted nothing else than to make a good impression. And I think I accomplished that. At least I hope that John, Kris, and Fuji think so. Brenden reminds me that compared to his last girlfriend, I did great. I am good with that.  I read through  urlLink Chris�  blog for the first time in a while today, being strung from the computer and what not. I realized how much I miss chats with him Thinking about you brother!  I am dead tired. Think I will now beg for a ride back to my house where I can go right to sleep.  Oh yeah�I bought a microwave :)

      I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I do not have a computer to play or even work on in my new apartment. I too am desperately out of the budget range to be able to afford one. I cant stand it! I get to check my email, chat with buddies, and update this blog once a week if I am lucky. I know that itself was more than I was writing on this thing anyway�but now I have an excuse.  My new place is good. The only things I seem to be lacking at the moment: 1. A computer (citing the previous angry thought) 2. A microwave (witch without negates so many of the living by yourself eating habits) 3. A bookshelf (I cry every time I see my books still boxed up) 4. A dresser (yet for some reason I am okay with a huge pile of clothes on the floor of my walk-in closet).   Other fun obstacles I have run into� 1. My 3 CD Player/Changer no longer works. Plays the radio and tapes just fine. Unfortunately I got rid of all my tapes when I was 12. 2. The DVD Player I was given by the parents of my ex only plays the DVD occasionally. How and why it decides to play what it decides to play is beyond me. I have to play games with it, opening and closing the disc tray a couple THOUSAND times until it finally registers that there is a disc there. It won�t even play the CD�s the CD player won�t play. Funny how that works.  3. I am not paying for cable, so I have lots of time and silence to contemplate the previous two points. 4. Paying rent really sucks. 5. Living on your own and STILL having to depend on other people to transport you really sucks. 6. Carrying groceries and clean laundry upstairs really sucks.  Please do not get me wrong, I love living on my own. That list was of things I have noticed and of things I can work on, or save money for rather. The rest of the apartment experience is top notch. Learning lots of new things and having fun while I do, what more can I ask for.  Then there came  urlLink Brenden , out of all places, Nevada. Literally, the day we met he was on his way back from Nevada where he was visiting his parents and where he once lived. I constantly ask myself how the hell I got so lucky, and how I ever convinced him out of a second glance. But I plan on holding onto him for a while. There are so many things that he says or does that make me stop. That is really the best way to put it I think. He makes me stop. My mind�my heart�anyway. I like him.  Work is work�same old same old. I reach my 90-day mark on September 10th on which my medical benefits become active. Being a diabetic, this is a very very good thing. Have had some issues with people I work with, but I think we may have worked through a couple of them. Hopefully. I will keep the masses (all 2 of you) informed.  All for now kids. I am off to rinse my head. I am on yet another adventure into a different shade of red. We will see how it turns out.

      I know it has been a while since the last post, and frankly I do not have any good excuse as to why. Although it may be true I do not have a computer, I should be able to get to doing this more than I do. Yet another thing to add to my list of �Things I need to kick myself in the ass for.�  I have been working a lot, as usual. They just hired a new fellow to help me out on the counter by the name of Peter. I am very happy and excited to have some help, but at the same time I am distressed that they have fired two people and another one will be quitting soon. I am starting to take some control over some things, making it more of an environment to work (happily) in. The absence of the people fired and soon to be leaving will greatly affect the moral and atmosphere�for the better. Work at the moment is like a live action soap opera, everyone in everyone else�s business�it gets very tiresome very quickly. I am seriously contemplating taking night school at one of the local trade schools to become a nurse. More research is needed before a decision can be made, but if I leave United I want something to immediately go into, none of this waiting to find a job crap.  I am actually thinking about a second job as well. I need the money. I am thinking that being overdrawn at the bank every week is NOT a good thing. Something else to research�  Then there is  urlLink Brenden . Over two months now we have been together. Truth be known�the whole experience is nothing but �new� for me. I have never felt this way about anyone�it�s new. I have never had a long distance relationship such as this before�it�s new. I have never been so attracted in so many different ways by anyone before�it�s new. I have come to find I am more paranoid then previously suspected. I have spent the year since my last relationship contemplating what went wrong, what I didn�t see�and this has led me to watch what I do and say very carefully. Brenden�s history and the states his ex�s were in only adds to the paranoia. His last girlfriend did a number on him, and I am doing everything in my power to be better and make him happy. I probably (I do, there is no question) think about it too much. I think too much in general, but I have mentioned that before.  Otherwise things are good. I have a roof. I have light. I have groceries. All is well.

      It's 7:30 in the morning. I am at work and I am happy. Suprise suprise. Those two variables would not usually make me happy, but consider this... 1. Ruben (with whom I work) makes wonderful mexican food, and he brought some sweet tamales and taquitos for breakfast. 2. My baby Brenden is picking me up from work. I can't wait to see him. 3. I hope that Brenden and I will be able to go to see Chris later tonight and pick up the computer he has so graciously found for me.  Again, it may only be 7:30, and I still might be asleep ar delirious, but the world seems to be ok. It's not normal for me to feel this way in the morning. But let's just go with it.

       God bless  urlLink Chris!   My buddy has found an abandoned computer for me to use. I will now be able to talk to the people I love more, and even the people I do not love. And there could not have been better timing, seeing as how I am starting my Stage Managing thing again, I will need a base to work from  Now we just need to figure out how to get it from there to here. Yet another adventure to contemplate. I might have  urlLink Brenden  help. And I am sure he is just dying to do so.  I am on lunch at work. I should probably get back to it. Tah Tah for now.

      So I am stealing time from work to write in this darn thing. With the security on these computers and the restrictions on what internet sites I can access, I am lucky when it actually loads the Blogger site. Sometimes it won't let me.  Everything is doing good. Working myself to the bone. I am very happy with Pete and the way the work enviornment is changing around here. There actually may be light at the end of this tunnel.   I am in love. And it is wonderful. I am really excited about this weekend. I am getting time off of work and  urlLink Brenden  and I are going to a party at one of his friends houses. I am very much needing some time off and some fun. Not to mention how happy seeing  urlLink Brenden   makes me. It makes me happy.  Happy happy happy.  And I am nervous too! Not only about meeting more of his friends, but meeting his family on Thanksgiving. We are going to Nevada where I will meet his parents. I wont meet his older brother Tom (his only sibling) untill December at another party.   Nervous nervous nervous.  Thats about it for now. I should probably get back to work. Probably. Even if I get off the computer, I may not work anyway. I will leave that to be decided at the proper time.

      What greater joy can one have than to be sitting and watching "Pirates of the Caribbean" and making convections for the holiday season? It might be better maybe if you take away my diabetes so that I could enjoy the convections I make....Maybe if you take away the fact I have to work in the morning....Maybe if you add  urlLink a gorgeous man  to the mix. Or maybe I should quit thinking about how to make it better and enjoy  urlLink Johnny  and  urlLink Orlando  in the privacy of my lonesome abode. If it is any conciliation...I have discovered I make really good fudge.  I have not written in a while. I say this at the beginning of just about every blog entry that I write. At least I am consistent. At least. I work and I rehearse. I do not have much else that takes me away from writing. There is  urlLink Brenden,  who does have more time to spend with me now the he is unemployed and out for winter break from school. I worry about him quite a bit. I worry that he is keeping himself from doing things to be with me...I worry that he won't be able to go to Japan this summer...I worry that I ask too much of him. He has spent the last week with me and it has been absolutely wonderful. He met my mothers side of the family at our annual Christmas shindig last night. Everyone very much approved...Something I was actually not used to with previous significant others I have brought with me. It was great to feel as proud as I did. The evening was not all fun and laughs however, and ended with my cousin-in-law Tim using his AAA membership to call a tow truck for  urlLink Brenden's  car that wouldn't start after we got to my aunt's house. As of this evening it was still in the shop with a tentative departure tomorrow morning.   I went to see "Return of the King" the day it came out. I had bought tickets for  urlLink Brenden  and I online for the 2:45 pm showing on the 17th. He was scheduled to take his Japanese final at 9 that morning, take care of a thing or two afterwards and head on up here to pick me up and see the show. The way things worked out, he didn't end up getting into Palmdale till 2:35 and we rushed to the theatre just in time to see the massive line that had formed outside working its way into the theatre. We were able to go to the kiosk in the lobby, get the tickets I purchased online, get into the theatre without having to wait outside in the cold AV weather, and just in time to see the new "Harry Potter" movie trailer. The theatre was full but we got pretty good seats. What I was dreading would turn into a horrible "LOTR" movie experience turned out to be quite the opposite. Plus, as a bonus, I unknowingly ran into one of my bestest buds  urlLink Clare  who was there watching it with her lil brother. We spent some time together afterwards and it became a very, very nice evening.  Speaking of which...for the hell of it...Here is another shot of  urlLink Orlando  from "Return of the King". Hehehe.  I hate to break it to the lot of you (thank you Pirates), but it does not look like I will be attending any classes this upcoming semester. I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY!!! I cry when I think about it. Ok, so maybe not every time. But I did cry....Once...  I hate being poor. I bought the gifts I needed for gift exchanges, and that left me with a big fat nothing to buy anything for  urlLink Brenden.  We decided that we would celebrate our Christmas and exchange gifts on New Year's Eve. That gives me another week and one more payday. Wish me luck.  I want to give  urlLink Chris  a hug. I want to see, or at least hear him smile. There is so much that I envy about him, I just want him to be content. I hope he can find happiness in the months to come.  I want life to be easy. I want to learn something everyday. I want to feel astounded constantly. I want to mean something.  Progression would be good. I know.

      So here I am. Sitting at home in my own apartment, a bowl of fresh Hamburger Helper in front of me and �Fellowship of the Ring� Extended version playing on the DVD player. It amazes me to think where I was a year ago. Certainly not here, that�s for sure.  I feel nowadays that I need to do something, accomplish something, find the meaning to things I don�t (or can�t) understand in my 23 years of age. Through church and my belief in God, I know what the meaning of life is, that is not what worries or troubles me. It is the day to day process, the question of what to do next. Is this making any sense?  I have registered for 12 units at school and will go if I can round up the money for tuition. I think that the 12 units will go nicely with the 48 hour work weeks that I put in at the moment. Somehow I doubt I will go through with all 12 units, but we will see what happens.    urlLink Brenden  is wonderful as usual. Time with him is becoming very important to me. On good weeks I see him on my weekend (Wed & Thu) as well as on his weekend (Sat & Sun). I know he loves me and I believe him when he tells me. But on the same hand I get very frustrated when we go for days at a time without seeing each other. I am at a loss for solutions at the moment. Good things can only get better at this point.  I have to thank  urlLink The Man Chris  yet again for this wonderful computer. It was exactly what I needed, despite the fact he kept telling me �It�s not the fastest computer�. It�s perfect for me and my humble abode.  I am really excited that my best bud  urlLink Clare  will be home in the AV for Christmas. It has been a while since we have had time together. There is a lot of catching up to do. I wanted her to come see �LOTR: Return of the King� with Brenden and I, but it seems that she and her family have made an event of it. I actually don�t know what Brenden and I will end up doing�maybe see it with his UCLA buds or maybe even watch it at Universal City and make a day of it. I am planning on making it a special day, whatever we choose to do.  Now that I have my own computer and insomnia, I can write longer blog entries. I hope that doesn�t disappoint my loyal audience�all 2 of you.  Smile, be well.

      So I twas looking at  urlLink Chris'  blog and linked to this personality test. It was very ammusing. Here are the results.                 ESFJ  - "Seller". Most sociable of all types. Nurturer of harmony. Outstanding host or hostesses. 12.3% of total population.

      Brenden and I had a really long talk last night. We discussed some fears, some thoughts, and the bottom line we came to was so simple. Very simple as a matter of fact.  We are in love.  I have a tendency to think more than I talk. This is both a good and a bad predicament. I tend to say what I mean, and to mean what I say...A quality I have come to find is lacking in the majority of the masses on the earth. On the flip side I do not say enough, I do not say what I am thinking and I tend to let things be overlooked when in fact they should be addressed. The former I will keep...The latter I will work on.  I considered my current life and lifestyle a lot last evening as well. I have realized there are things needing to be changed. As a result of me not driving I am falling just short of falling off the face of the world. In other words those who knew me before have somewhat forgotten my existence. Brenden questioned why I do not hang out with my buds when I am here alone and he is home in Fullerton. The answer took a while...But the solution is simple, I need my license back. It became obvious that I was the one visiting people and making the contact and what not. When I stopped contacting others, all contact stopped.   I realized how much I need to live close to the one I love. He will be starting school this coming week...Having class Monday through Friday...A booked schedule with little travel time meaning little long distance girlfriend time. It is do-able, but dammit, it makes me sad. I am working my application for Cal State Fullerton and for the much needed financial aid needed for such an endeavor. It will be tough.  I applied for a Customer Service Representative position at Countrywide Home Loans. Why you may ask...The response being that United Rentals is sucking the life out of me. Draining my soul through my eyes, so it is. I need a change. The work situation would take a page or two itself to explain, and frankly I am not up for it and it would lead to nothing but restless sleep if I think about it all and write it all at this juncture. So you will have to live with that. Like anyone reads this anyway...  I am going to watch some more FireFly now. It is (was) a wonderful series...For all those other sci-fi freaks such as myself. Look into it.

      Happy Birthday to you...Happy birthday to you...Happy birthday dear Brendan...Happy birthday to you.  You know the tune...How many of you read that WITHOUT singing it in your heads? That's what I thought.  Yes, it is Brenden's birthday and I have yet to see him. I worked today and he looked for work today...Along with hanging out with the guys and helping John move back into his dorm room. He keeps telling me to not make a big deal out of it, but I cannot help it. I want to...Which leads to another problem of being broke and not being able to afford anything to get him. I think I will make him a card.   I am really growing impatient with my mother. She loves me, that is very obvious and very clear. It is only the fact that I see her and her love on a daily basis. I love her too...But I would be more apt to show my love if I was able to be a independent 23 year old...In the complete sense of the word that is. I live on my own, I pay my bills, I work full time, I am in a serious relationship...But yet I still find myself calling mom for a ride home. It is getting to me in such a bad way!  Work is moving downhill yet again. There was a bright spot when Ann was hired in the back office, and it still is. More estrogen was what I needed in the office. But there is still something that is off. Maybe, I think, I just don't like it. More research is needed on the subject.  I'm in love. Somebody help me. I no longer control what I do or say so do not blame me for things that may offend. It is the inebriation from the drug amore...There is no cure. At least not to this one.

      Almost 6 am on a Sunday morning. I really need to find a job where I can at least sleep in on the weekends. At least.   Brenden's birthday is on Tuesday. The problem I am running into is that I do not get paid untill Friday. I have an idea of what I would like to do, but alas I can not make it happen for three days following the event. Alot like Christmas. I did not end up having the money to ge this presents until the day after Christmas. Such a winner I am. Really.  I am very excited about that pay check actually. I have two holidays and two days of overtime that will be counted in the hours. should work out to be about an extra $200 bones or so. Just in time for my birthday plan...Muah Ha Ha. I was never really good at being evil. Oh well.  It is a relief that the holidays are over. Now I can focus on work and the show. The show is going really well. We ran through all of Act I on Friday and we are running through Act II this afternoon. I have yet to get into my actual Stage Manager mode. I have not been to as many rehearsals as I should have been, and it is still going to be an issue getting to the Sunday rehearsals. I will have to leave early from work so I will have to see what Pete thinks about that.

That makes me sad...saying that...and it's not like I have experienced anything else...it's just a feeling...you know...one of those nausiated, sick, faint kind of feelings.  It will all be over Sunday night. I hope I survive till then.  Cross your fingers, legs, what have you...

      So life is quite hum drum. I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Just a...thing I guess.  I got to see Brenden Saturday, Sunday, and even Monday morning. It was really nice :) His semester is over as of Tuesday, and hopefully I will be able to see him a litte more often.  It has been decided that I have three weeks left with United Rentals. Please don't cry, no way in hell I am going to. The funny, even ironic coincidence is that I was hired and had my first day at United June 10th 2003 and my last day will be June 10th 2004. Funny, or maybe its just funny to me.  Brenden found a funny web comic...my feelings on   TROY   to the T.  urlLink  Check it out!

      Today is the 9 month anniversary of the initiation of relations between Brenden and I. I am trying to make it sound as unromantic as possible to help make myself feel better for not being able to see him today.   I am in desperate need of finding a willing and able body to finish the lease out on my apartment. I cannot leave without someone to take my place. I am really getting worried and paranoid about it.  SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!  The lease is up in August, and it would really really suck if I have to take the train to Irvine for 3 months.  SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!   I am a little sad, a little stressed out...  But I could not be more happy to be with someone in my life. Never knew what Love was till he came along. Okay...I'll stop now.

      Chris gave me a topic to write about. I do not remember how he phrased it, but the gist of it was to name the 5 albums that describe me/my life the best. At least I think that was what he asked, if it wasn't I have no doubt that he will correct me :)  Here it goes...(in no particular order)...   1.  "Surfacing"  Sarah McLachlan-  Sarah writes and sings her songs about the worry and care that she has for other people. I can relate to her helping hand, her consideration, and her pity.   2.  "When the Pawn"  Fiona Apple-  Fiona also writes about her feelings for other people, the men in her life to be more specific. I can see myself saying many of her lyrics to the men in my life. And dammit do they deserve it.   3.  "Tails"  Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories-  I love listening to Lisa and her lyrics. They are fun, child-like, and at times far fetched. I can lose myself in her music and her lyrics. Her songs bring me back to the time where I embarked in my theatre aspirations. I remember listening to her in the car too and from rehearsals, singing at the top of my lungs.    4.  "August & Everything After"  Counting Crows-  Jonathan Vaughan, one of the first loves of my life, introduced me to the Counting Crows my Junior year in high school. He had just moved out from Texas and was in my drama class. We clicked immediately. To this day he is still one of my bestest buds. One of the few friends that you know where ever you end up, you will always have their telephone number. Jon and I used to sing these songs together...He on his guitar while I created harmony lines in my head...I miss him. This is our album.   5.  "We Can't Dance"  Genesis-  First of all, Phil Collins is wonderful. Second of all, this album reminds me of my family and our funny side, as well as the serious moments that we share. And there is a song about crashing cars...Why I relate to that I have no idea.

      I added a link to  urlLink GameSpys Daily Victim  to the sidebar. For those of you unfamiliar with the site, it is "GameSpy's daily tribute to Internet culture." Basically, it likes to make the gaming world and the gamers in the world laugh...usually at the expense of themselves. urlLink  Brenden  introduced me to the site with these two "Victims". He said they sort of reminded him of me. Take a gander.         urlLink   Traci-Like Victim #1        urlLink  Traci -Like Victim #2

      Let us all give me a round of applause, I slept for a full 8 hours last night! Not only that, I woke up refreshed and full of hope for the future. All three of these things are new to me. It feels kind of strange, indeed.  In-N-Out is doing a background check on me for the Customer Service department in Irvine. I will know in a week or so if they want to officially hire me. Keep your fingers crossed that the phelonies on my record won't foul things up. If all works out, I will also need to find residence in Irvine. I may have a room or two lined up...I will keep this updated.  I miss my friends. I want to drive again. I have contacted the DMV and they are sending a letter for me and my doctor to fill out. Hopefully, I will have my license back by September. That is my goal.  I am going to go watch LOTR, again!

      Long time, no see...huh kids?  Well, I got my computer back and I am raring to go on this blog thing again. Not for you, mind you, but for me. See...If I put a selfish spin on this, I will fool myself into a motive. Ssshhh...Don't tell anyone!  I am looking for a job in Orange County. Preferably in Irvine or in Fullerton. I am moving to be close to my honey Brenden. We are still together, almost 9 months strong now. We were discussing and researching a place together, but unfortunately he will not have the funds to leave the room he is renting while going to school, so I will be doing the same. I will look for a room to rent as well. (www.roommates.com, I recommend it.)  Been running into some people from the past as of late. Men from the past to be more accurate. Some are on good terms, some are total mistakes. I was speaking with my friend Jason, reminiscing and what not. I came to realize no matter what our relationship was before, that we can have a strong friendship now and in the future. One of those things that reminds me I am a grown up. Yeah...Scared the hell out of me.   Weddings...  One of my best friends, Josh, is getting married in June. I don't get to see Josh as often as I would like...Never really. But I could not be more happy for him and Christina. They deserve to be happy. Brenden's older brother Tom is getting married next year and has asked Brenden to be his best man. I think that means I am invited to the wedding...One can hope. Brenden, our friend Tony and I were in Tony's garage a while ago talking about Tom's nuptials. Brenden started giggling...When asked his motivation for the giggle he looked at me and said "Maybe we should make it a double wedding." Tony and I sat him down and explained that jokes like that with a girlfriend like me are not really a good idea.  I am slowly pulling myself from the theatre scene here in the AV. I had to turn down 4 offers to stage manage for the college and a few community groups. Made me sad...My reputation is finally getting around and I will not be around myself to see it. Damn me.  I will attempt to keep my blog up and running this time around. For me...Remember?

      So it's been almost two weeks since the last post. I have completed the move to Victorville and I finished unpacking the last box this afternoon.  Victorville, I am still in a state of denial. Don't get me wrong...Victorville is an okay place. People have been living here for a long time, doing just fine, and living very normal and adjusted lives. But it is not where I wanted to go. Not where I want to be. Please understand my motivation if I ever speak ill of the town.  I was hired at a company by the name of  urlLink MWB Business Systems.  I will be working customer service in the billing department of the company. I was overjoyed to hear that they have an office in Irvine, and employees are welcome to transfer from one office to another. Cross your fingers, this may be a very big opportunity.  I got the call on Monday that they would like me to come in and get the paperwork for the ever popular "Drug and Alcohol Screen". Seeing as though I am neither an alcoholic or a drug-ee, I am considering myself hired. I start on Tuesday, July 6th, after the holiday weekend. I did this before and the job did not work out, but let's see how this additional link to the sidebar works out.  I went to a buddies wedding this weekend in Santa Ana. With Brenden's car still out of the picture, we worked the bus, train and taxi system to death over the two days I was there. Public transportation...remind me t get my ass on the whole "get my license back" campaign. I need it. Badly.  The wedding itself was very very nice. I was going to see some dear friends, who after being out of touch for over a year, were not as dear as they used to be. I was picturing going to the wedding, sitting with my buds at their table, chumming it up and having a grand time. I got there, hugged who I could, sat at a table with people I did not know, and I was in the really hard place of wanting to strike up conversations, but having no flippin' idea of what to say. It was hard, it was reality, but it was hard.  So plans now are to enjoy this next week I will still not be working, doing a lot of sleeping, and trying to find some way to spend my 4th of July. And, oh...yes..19 days till my birthday :)

      At the end of this post, I will be dismantling my computer and packing her up. We will be loading the truck this evening, and on our way to Victorville tomorrow.  Don't cry for me, Antelope Valley! The truth is I've always wanted to leave you! All through my wild days, my mad existence...  Sorry, bad show tune reference. I will stop.  See you in Victorville!

      We did it! My mom and I were approved for our apartment. Tomorrow is my last day of work at United and I couldn't be more happy. I will be getting my last check at the end of my shift and I won't have to go back to that place...Till Saturday...When I pick up the moving truck we are using to move to Victorville.  Brenden is still in San Jose. I don't remember if I had mentioned the car trouble he was having, but he has a rental car up there. He is having fun with the kids he is volunteering for. The kids are high school students who are leaving for foreign exchange in countries in Europe and in Japan. It only proves how pathetic I am that I get jealous that he is far away doing fun, great things and I am here...Packing...To move to the densest part of the actual "middle of nowhere".  I talked with some other buddies and they tell me how great their new apartment or their new girlfriend are. I am sincerely happy for them, but boy does it sting.  I am being melodramatic. Over reacting....In the stupid sense of the word. I'll get over it. I just need to sleep. A lot.

      I have too much time at the end of everyday to contemplate, review, and at times regret the things I did or did not do that particular day. This, in some cases, could be very unhealthy. At times, in my case, it is. I feel this is what at times leads me to the inability to sleep.   Brenden left today for a week in San Jose. He was on his way up yesterday and his timing belt blew on his engine outside of Magic mountain. He had to spend lots of money to get it towed back to Orange County and he will be spending a lot more money getting it running again. He is making plans to bike for a while, and take the metro...bike to and from the metro...if that makes any sense. I am worried as hell for him. He rented a car to continue his attempt up to San Jose, spent just about the rest of his money. I baked him some chocolate chip cookies and he stopped by to pick them up and kiss me goodbye.  We kissed...A lot :)  He will be coming back to town on the 20th. I will be moved to Victorville by then. I hope...that's the plan. Speaking of which, I have to pack. That would be good, don't you think?

      For all those of you who are familiar with the pattern of my life, it will not surprise you that plans have changed...Yet again.   Facts-  1. No longer will I be moving to Orange County. 2. No longer will I be starting a job with In-N-Out Burger. 3. I am still leaving work at United Rentals (thank God!) 4. I will be moving to  urlLink Victorville . 5. I will be sharing a two bedroom apartment with  urlLink my mother . 6. I will not be any closer to  urlLink Brenden , which makes me very very sad.  I have given 30 day notice at my current apartment and plans to move will happen sometime before the end of June. My mom's lease is up June 20th, so she will either be moving into our new place (which we are looking for) or moving in with me in my one bedroom apartment until we find our new place. You must agree how exciting this all is.   Brenden, however, was not excited. Neither was my manager-to-be at In-N-Out. I hope and pray that all this disappointment and sadness and sacrifice will turn into unforeseen blessings in the future. I am healthy, alive, and capable...Must focus on things to be thankful for.

      So "Rock Around the Clock" is over...finally! The last show was Sunday evening. It was a good turn out, we sold out all 4 shows. Wayne and "It's Only Tuesday" Productions had a success...yeah for them!  Memorial Day was good. I worked from 8am to noon, Brenden picked me up and we went to see Shrek 2. We went to Olive Garden for an early dinner and then we spent the rest of the afternoon at home. It was very very nice.  Aasem texted me to let me know he was having a party that evening. We got cleaned up and went over to Karyn and Aasems house. It was alot of fun, saw some people I had not seen in a very long time. Some were even sad to hear I was moving. Makes me think I have made somewhat of an impression on thier lives. Amazing.  So I have given 30 days notice at the apartment complex here. I was given wrong information and I do not need to find someone to take the lease. I have given notice and I need to be out by July 1st. I start at In-N-Out on the 21st of June, so hopefully I will find a room or something before the end of the month.  Keep your fingers crossed, I will keep the blog updated.

      It is almost 5 o'clock. I usually look forward to my couch and a DVD after work. Today, I am lucky enough to be watching my niece (Caitlin, 4 years old) and my nephew (Toby, 1 year old) at my apartment. It gets better...when my mom gets home around 6pm or so, I get to take Caitlin downstairs to the pool to go swimming. It should be a...how should I say it...eventful evening.   I am very excited about Saturday. I will be taking the train to Fullerton Friday night after work to see  urlLink Brenden , the love of my life. On Saturday afternoon, we are going to meet my friend  urlLink Chris  and he, as the  urlLink master photographer  that he is, will be taking some pictures of Brenden and I. It is hard to imagine that  urlLink Brenden  and I have been together for almost a year and I do not have one photograph of us together.  urlLink Chris  may be able to bring his girlfriend, Danya, with him. It will be nice to finally meet her.   It will be nice to see  urlLink Brenden . We had a good talk this last weekend. It became obvious that we both need to work on the way we approach our relationship.&nbsp; I need to lighten up, that in itself will solve a lot of issues that arise. Slowly but surly, I will become a better person, right?   Living with mom is interesting. She does this touchy feely thing that really bugs me. I mean, not touchy feely, but poke me in the arm, or rub my head, or flick my ear, tickle the top of my hand....ARGH! I really really REALLY do not like it. I have shared these feelings with her. It has yet to do any good.   Leslie and Zach are moving here to Hesperia this weekend. The High Desert will be home to my mother, my brother Toby and his family, my sister Leslie and her family, and myself. Jamie remains in San Marcos with my Aunt and Uncle, and Corey and his family are in Arizona. It is sad that we all used to live in town together, and that we are slowly but surly moving apart...further and further. If my life goes as planned, I will be in Orange County in a year or so. Further and further...people do&nbsp;not understand this family ties thing. I don't think I need them to, just as long as they know what  urlLink my family  means to me.   I want to go to school.   Oh well.

      Here I am. Getting ready to leave work. My sister-in-law Jen called me in a panic today to come watch the kids when I got off. I thought to myself...gee Traci...of course you can say yes... YOU HAVE NO LIFE !   So there is more trouble on the horizon. I thought I was clean out of my previous apartment, but it turns out that they are holding me responsible for about a thousand dollars. They told me not to worry about the lump sum, ans that I can pay it off in payments. Boy, did that make me feel better.   I owe mom lots of monet for bills.   It makes me very sad to be away from  urlLink Brenden  as much as I am. I shared my feelings with him. The only solution that we can come up with is the realization that we are very differnent in the way we feel about being apart. I have a feeling I wouldn't be so bad if I had mobility and other things to do. Theatre...I need some theatre dammit.

      Dear Mr./Ms. Anonymous,  Thank you for your comment. This is the first comment I have received from anyone other than friends of mine. I did not think anyone else even looked at this site. So in that sense, thank you for reading.  I read your comment and my first reaction was to get defensive. I am still somewhat in that vein. BOTH my car accidents were due to blackouts having to do with my Diabetes: A disease...a genetic disease...something that I do not consider "my fault". I do not want to delve into my medical history, but needless to say, I have...in writing...letters and forms from medical professionals giving me clearance and permission to operate a motor vehicle.   I appreciate your concern, I believe for your own well being. I too have concern for your well being. As "anonymous", I will not be able to pick you or your vehicle out of the crowd to ensure that no harm comes to you. If it makes you feel any better, I will be giving myself restrictions on when and under what conditions I drive. Restrictions not set by a doctor, judge, or department of motor vehicles...but by myself.  So, with this said, I will return to work and continue towards getting my license again. I hope to see you on the road soon. Safe Driving :)

      4 days (and counting) till my day of birth!  Plans at this point are to go south and hang out with Brenden and the UCLA fellas for the weekend. Now that I am employed, and need to be at work Monday morning, I will have to take the train down to the OC on Saturday morning and jump back on the train Sunday afternoon to get home. I really need to drive :(  Work...is slowly getting better. First week or so I was sitting watching people work. It was supposed to be some sort of training, but all I was doing was falling asleep. Things are better now. I have been given a couple specific tasks to complete on a daily basis and it makes the day go much faster. We will see how it will turn out.  How is everyone else doing?

      Here in my cubicle...My lovely little world I am creating for myself. I am still in a wee bit of shock. Going from a workplace dominated by testosterone to my new work place where testosterone is non-existent.   I have never been a fan of women. My mother, yes, girlfriends...Sometimes. We simply do not get along at times. Please pray for me, make a wish, sacrifice a goat, whatever it is that you do to send me luck and the will to survive and enjoy my time here.  Let's face it.  I am never happy.  Otherwise, my new job is wonderful! I manage contracts for service and maintenance on office equipment (ie copiers and fax machines). There is no telemarketing, which I was worried about, and I simply help customers with existing accounts and contracts. At least I will...Eventually.  Like I said, I have my own cubicle, pictures on the desk and all. Question is...Do I have a picture of you?
