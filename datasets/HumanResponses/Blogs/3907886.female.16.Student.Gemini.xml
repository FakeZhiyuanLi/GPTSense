       At first, the day was rainy, and everyone I talked to was sad, or having a bad day.  When I talked to Mel, she was tired so we just decided to sit and watch a movie.  Then I talked to David's brother.  He was boring and sounded really down for some reason.  Didn't wanna say much, but I could tell that he was having a bad day.  Next comes a friend who I'm getting to know a lot better.  He said that he woke up with a horrible feeling.  Then his day just got worse.  I felt so bad, not to mention helpless because their was absolutely nothing I could do!  Now he's at the zoo (jealousy alert, I   Luv, Ani

       So last night, I didn't sleep at all.  The night before, it was for 2.5 hours, and the night before that, only 2 hours.  I donno what's wrong with me!?!?!  I'm just never tired!  I suppose that I've just got better things to do.  So anyways, today, I was looking at this really cool site online, and I have decided everything that I want to get pierced: Cartilage (home) Lobe (x2) (home) Another ear part (professional) Tongue    (home) Right Nose (home) Belly Button (home)  So what's that, like 7 piercings?  And call me crazy or whatever, but I also sorrta wanna get my nipples and my clit pierced, but I think that those would hurt like hell, and I'm not sure that I could take that.  Anyways, those would totally have to be professionally done, so I have awhile to contemplate...  As for tattoos, their are three that I want. 1. A solid black paw print on my left ankle. 2. Something all the way around my upper arm, but not sure what yet. 3. A Chinese tattoo that's meaningful to me either on my back sholderblade (right) or in the upper or lower center of my back.    So still undecided on those, but it's ok.  Like I said, I have awhile to decide.  Any thoughts or comments to help me choose?  Well, gonna go console with a friend now!  Be back tomarrow!  Luv,  Ani

       This is weird.&nbsp; The last blog I did was like 12 hours ago, yet today is anew day!&nbsp; Funny how things like that work out.&nbsp; Right now, I'm sortta feeling tired, even though last night I slept 15 hours!&nbsp; That's because about 3 hours ago, I had stitches on my tounge.&nbsp; See, it's really a funny story; I was kickboxing with Craig.&nbsp; Now Craig is good.&nbsp; No, he's beyond good, he's great, increadiable, exellent.&nbsp; And I'm only so-so.&nbsp; Well, anyways, Craig and I are in the ring together, and I'm sort of holding my own when Craig lands a right hook to my head, and an uppercut to my jaw.&nbsp; This sends me flying backwards and I land on my tailbone, and my head slams into the floor.&nbsp; Being caught completely unprepared, I had my mouth open so my teeth smashed down on my tounge.&nbsp; I bit straight through, and the tip was only hanging on by some tissue in the corner.&nbsp; Instantly my mouth was filled with blood.&nbsp; I had gotten the wind knocked out of me, and I was gaging for air.&nbsp; Blood was sputtering out of my mouth, and I couldn't tell which way was up, I was so dissorientated.&nbsp; People rushed over to me, and helped me up.&nbsp; They got me to open my mouth, and looked at my tounge.&nbsp; I don't think that they could have seen much with all the blood and all, but I obiously needed stiches.&nbsp; I was rushed into someone's car with a couple towels under my chin, and we sped our way to St. E's emergency center... &nbsp; Rest of my adventure tomarrow when I'm not so tired! &nbsp; ~Ani

       So today I woke up feeling slightly distorted and odd.  Perhaps that is because it happened to be 2:00 in the afternoon!  I can't belief it, last night I actually slept!  And what's more than that, I slept for 15 hours!  I can't belief it.  But I'm still trying to deal with my odd feeling that I woke up with.  Last night I fell asleep crying for no reason at all!  And this morning I still feel sad.  Well, not so much sad anymore, but just numb.  Why is it that when people decide to be mad at me, they seem to get mad at me in mass?  I can't stand being on bad terms with people.  No matter what the reason, I seem to always be drawn towards fixing, and improving our relationship.  However, today, things aren't the same.  I feel numb, and don't really want to make an effort on my friendships/relationships with people.  I know that it sounds horrible, and I feel horrible for wanting to do so, but I just need a break from all of the pressures, and feelings that come from relationships with people.    fortunately for me, this weekend I get to go to Spring Green.  My family and I are gonna meet some really neat old friends from St. Paul, MN.  They are awesome.  And what's even better, we are gonna see the American Player's perform.  They are an outside Shakespearian acting company.  Last year in RSA, they came and performed   The Taming of the Shrew  .  It was really good.  We are also gonna stay at a bed and breakfast.  Sleeping late, being in a new, calming environment, and spending the day outside in beautiful weather seems wonderful.  Just what I'm craving right now.  No stresses, just relaxation and comfort!  Hopefully when I get back, I will be able to make amends with all of my friends, and life will get better!    until next time,  ~Ani

       So today at work completely sucked.&nbsp; Everything was going fine until like 9:00 when these two really hot guys came in.&nbsp; They just stood around for about 15 min, waiting for who knows what.&nbsp; Finally, they decide to order something, and one comes up to me.&nbsp; He goes, "You look really familiar, no seriously, do I know you?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now here I am thinking, what a cheesy pick up line, but why the hell would a guy like him be trying to pick me up.&nbsp; So I go along thinking that he's serious.&nbsp; After all, when he did come in, he looked like this guy that went to Appleton West last year: Drew Peterson or something like that.&nbsp; But anyways, he said that he had just moved here, and didn't know anyone.&nbsp; Then he asks me when DC closed.&nbsp; I'm like, "10:30."&nbsp; And he asks me if I'm closing tonight.&nbsp; I say yes, and he goes, "Well, I guess that I'll be back at 10:30 then."  &nbsp;  I said whatever, not really thinking that he'd come back, and imagine my supprise when at 10:29, here comes this guy through the door.&nbsp; He said that he thought I droped something, and hands me a napkin.&nbsp; I'm like, ok, and he leaves.&nbsp; I'm about to throw it away, when I see that their's something written on it.&nbsp; I unfold it, and there's a cellphone #.&nbsp; So all night I'm contemplating whether or not to call.&nbsp; Eventually, curiosity gets the best of me when I get home, and I call.&nbsp; I hear a recording.&nbsp; I was devastated.&nbsp; He didn't give me his phone number, he gave me a rejection hotline number.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I felt so stupid.&nbsp; Like a complete idiot.&nbsp; How could I have possible thought that a cute guy like him would have ever gone for someone like me?&nbsp; I wanted to cry, but then I realized that if someone like him was mean enough to do something like what he did to someone, then they aren't worth one second of my time, or one ounce of my tears.&nbsp; Besides, I cried enough today.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I pierced my eyebrow today!&nbsp; It hurt like hell!&nbsp; And when I called Tracey at work today, she said that she didn't really want anyone to have any sort of facial jewelry besides the basic ear stuff.&nbsp; So I had to go out and get a clear spacer to put in for work so that no one could tell.&nbsp; But when I got home tonight, after I got over that whole phone # incident, I put my curved titanium black barbell in.&nbsp; It took some shoving, some whimpering, some tears, and a few disgusting pops of breaking skin, but eventually I got it in.&nbsp; It has gems on each side, and let me tell you, it's hot!&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; And what's better, today, I took my mom's credit card, and bought $60.00 worth of piercing stuff online.&nbsp; Now I'll have it all: the hollow needles, the clamp, the tongue ring, and the nose ring.&nbsp; Everything I need to be a full out punk rocker!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Or something like that.&nbsp; Well, I guess I'm gonna go mope around tonight, cause their's nothing to do.&nbsp; I'd go kickbox my punching bag, but that's hitting a little to close to home at the moment.&nbsp; Or should I say, a little to close to the mouth...  &nbsp;  Well, as always, until next time,  &nbsp;  ~Ani

       Sorry I couldn't finish last night.&nbsp; I was just so tired.&nbsp; And would ya look at the time, almost 12 hours later!&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; So anyways where was I?&nbsp; Oh yeah, so I'm on my way to the hospital.&nbsp; We walk in and by this time, both towels are soaked with blood, as well as my face, hair and shirt.&nbsp; We run of to the nurse, she takes one look with me, and shouts out to someone else that we have a class B trauma for room 6.&nbsp; No clue what that means, but it must have been serious, cause they swipe me off my feet, onto a wheelchair, and run me down the hall to room 6.&nbsp; I stand up, and then sit on the table.&nbsp; There were like 3 nurses around me, all trying to look in my mouth, but I didn't wanna open, cause I knew that they were gonna poke around or something and make it hurt even more!&nbsp; Finally, after about 2 min of convincing from Craig and Shelly, I opened.&nbsp; Even then, they still couldn't see anything because of all the blood.&nbsp; So they took this suction thingy off the wall, and started around the outside, trying to get rid of some of the blood.&nbsp; I was trying to look at it as well, because I didn't know what I had done.&nbsp; Their were a few "Oh my!"s and a few "Good lord!"s, but all and&nbsp;all, I think they've seen worse.&nbsp; In like another min, a doctor came in and looked at my mouth, just like the nurses had.&nbsp; He said that I would deffinantly need stitches, and sent off someone to page the anatheisiologist, and to get the equipment.&nbsp; By now, I'm done crying from the pain, but I really didn't want stitches, so I think I started crying.&nbsp; Random people were trying to hold my hand, and keep me away from my mouth.&nbsp; Finally, this guy came in with some needles.&nbsp; He said that he was going to numb my tongue so they could fix it.&nbsp; When they were all done, he told me that he would also give me a shot of painkillers in my tongue.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The shots hurt like crazy.&nbsp; For some fucked up reason, they had to put them right into my tongue, right were the skin was broken.&nbsp; I was screaming like crazy, and trying to get away, but it was no use because I had like 4 people holding me down.&nbsp; After the second shot though, my tongue and mouth began to feel funny, and I didn't even realize that he had given me a few more injections.&nbsp; Finally, he was done, and left.&nbsp; Now the doctor is standing over me with his nurse, still sucking out the blood.&nbsp; The doctor has this needle, that sort of looked like a sewing needle.&nbsp; He said that he would explain everything that he was doing so that I wouldn't have to be scared.&nbsp; He also said that I wouldn't be able to feel a thing, and he was right, cause I didn't.&nbsp; I could feel his hands in my mouth, and something pressing on my tongue I think, but no pain at all!&nbsp; It was kinda weird.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He kept changing needles, and thread.&nbsp; I tried to ask him why, but he told me not to talk.&nbsp; Shelly knew that I was being curious, so she read my mind and asked for me.&nbsp; He relpied that the clear thread that looked like fishing line was to go inside my tongue, to help heal the cappilaries, or little blood vessels that feed out towards the tip of my tongue.&nbsp; He said that these would dissolve within a week.&nbsp; The black thread however was permanent, and would be going on the top of my tongue.&nbsp; That I would have to go back and have removed.&nbsp; For the bottom of my tongue, simply because it always touches and would be irritating the bottom of my mouth, he just put the clear stuff on, along with a layer of this gooey stuff, that he said was like superglue for the mouth.  &nbsp;  When he was all done with the stiching and everything, he left to go get cleaned up, and the nurse started talking about aftercare with me, while she was dressing my tongue.&nbsp; They put nasty tasting antibiotic stuff all over, and cleaned it again for me.&nbsp; Then after a few more talks, and the ever so popular calling of my parent's, I was free to go.&nbsp; We went to the gas station on Richmond to get some of that really small, but good airy ice that's good for chewing.&nbsp; And we also had to get new toothpaste, anasepthic stuff, and listerine mouthwash.&nbsp; Gross!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, anyway's that's all about me and my tongue.&nbsp; I do have a few more things to mention, but not now.&nbsp; Maybe later tonight when I'm bored!  &nbsp;  Untill next time,  &nbsp;  ~Ani

       It's good to be home.&nbsp; Even though I was only gone for like one night!&nbsp; But I swear I went crazy because I couldn't type, talk to papal online, or call anyone!&nbsp; I missed my friends...&nbsp; And then, what was even worse: the second I got home, I tried calling 6 people, and none of them were home!&nbsp; I wanted to be all like, "surprise, I'm home!&nbsp; Did ya miss me for that one entire night?!?!?!"&nbsp; But I couldn't even do that.  &nbsp;  So than about a half hour later, I go online, and imagine my surprise when 3 of my friends that I had tried to call, sigh on exactly after I did!&nbsp; And then guess who gets a phone call from 2 more papal later?!?!?!&nbsp; You guessed it:&nbsp;I did!  &nbsp;  So talking to my friend's made me really happy!&nbsp; It usually always does.&nbsp; But then sad calls started to come in...  &nbsp;  First, my friend calls, all in a tither because she doesn't know how far she wants to go with her boyfriend...  Next, someone online tells me their being used by the person that they really liked!&nbsp;  And finally, my other friend got dumped by his boyfriend, and was a wreck.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  To tell the truth, all three of my friends were when we talked.&nbsp; And what pissed me off the most is that I couldn't do a damn thing about it!&nbsp; I wanted to just make their problems go away, and their hurting stop with the wave of my magic wand that I bought in Spring Green...  &nbsp;  But that's not how problems and heartbreak are fixed.&nbsp; They take time.&nbsp; Damn time.&nbsp; The one thing that should be constant in the universe, but isn't.&nbsp; I know to them, probally just getting through the night is going to be like days.&nbsp; And I don't even know if what I'm saying is right!&nbsp; I just keep thinking, what if I'm giving the wrong advice, or what if what I think is comforting really isn't...&nbsp; Their are so many questions and doubts that I have, but I don't dare go there with these three.&nbsp; They have enough problems, that the last thing that I would want to do is pressure them with something else.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I lay off of my problems, as well as bad news with them so they don't feel worse.&nbsp; I listen carefully to what they have to say, and tell them kindly what I honestly think and feel.&nbsp; I empathise, but do not feel overly sorry as to prevent throwing them into a puddle of mud and self misery that they would never be able to get out of...  &nbsp;  But one more question that I still have is what do I say to them to try and alleviate some of their pain?&nbsp; And do I talk about myself.&nbsp; I don't want to sound self centered, like I'm not focusing on their problem, but I also don't want them to over think it right now.&nbsp; Reflection on one's problem's should come after the coping, healing, and pain have passed.&nbsp; Not during, or it will just make everything much worse.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh well, all I can do is try my best, and give it my all.&nbsp; What more should people ask, or expect from me?  &nbsp;  For all my struggling friends out their, I hope your problems eventually subside, because life will go on, the pain will cease, and all will be forgiven eventually.  &nbsp;  With my deepest love,  &nbsp;  ~Ani

       So now I'm home from work, and I finally have time to sit down and really think.&nbsp; Last night, or this morning, or whatever, I met the man of my dreams.&nbsp; I was seriously swept off my feet.&nbsp; It was like he knew exactly the right thing to say to make me swoon.&nbsp; I was captivated by him so much that I didn't even realize it.&nbsp; I started to open up to him.&nbsp; I actually started to let myself go... Which is something that after my last relationship, I swore I would never do again.  &nbsp;  When I realized what was happening to me, I suddenly pushed him away.&nbsp; I pushed everyone away.&nbsp;All my friends, my mom and dad, the people at work, everyone.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I gave Adam my love.&nbsp; And I realized that I had given it to other people, my friends, as well.  &nbsp;  Giving someone your love is giving them the power to destroy you, yet trusting them not to.&nbsp; The last 3 times that I trusted someone, they destroyed me.&nbsp; I won't let that happen again.&nbsp; So I took back the power.&nbsp; I took back my love.&nbsp; And doing so cost me many friendships.&nbsp; Why do my actions always lead to regret?&nbsp; It seems that no matter what road I decide to take, I'm always wrong.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I guess from now on, maybe I should try creating my own new path.&nbsp; Not some premade one, but a path that is all my own.&nbsp; A path that leads me to happiness.&nbsp; I will pave this path in gold, and never again stray off.  &nbsp;  I'm not sure what to do now.&nbsp; I feel so lost, in&nbsp;a forest of darkness, with no light shining through.&nbsp; I need help to find where&nbsp; the new path starts.&nbsp; But I've pushed everyone who knows away!&nbsp; I have to go try to get them back.  &nbsp;  Maybe I'll have better news later, or tomorrow...  &nbsp;  Good bye  &nbsp;  ~Ani

       I've got tons to say, but unfortauntly I gotta go to work in a few bits.&nbsp; So I'll deal out the vitals for now. &nbsp; Last night was the best night of my life. Last night was also the worst night of my life. I got into 2 fights with friends today. I bitched out another friend. I betrayed someone's trust. I tried to steal $500, but thought better of it. &nbsp; So all in all, my day pretty much sucked.&nbsp; And the worst part is I made everything so much worse by yelling and complaining to ppl about it.&nbsp; Right now I really Have no one to talk.&nbsp; I really want to make amends, but their are so many fucked up things right now, I don't even know where to begin.&nbsp; Maybe I should just start with the truth, even though that one will be the hardest ever... &nbsp; Hopefully I'll get back online after work and will be able to hash out a few of my friendship glitches... &nbsp; Later, &nbsp; ~Ani

       My computer is being slow right now...&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it's because I'm trying to download 3 different software programs all at the same time.&nbsp; My web browser is just taking forever to load, that's all.&nbsp; Easily remedied.&nbsp; Anyways, I'm getting ICQ instant messaging, which you're probally thinking is pointless because I already AOL, Yahoo, and MSN instant messaging.&nbsp; The next one, this you're really gonna laugh at, Google Bloger instant messaging!&nbsp; Meet: Hello.&nbsp; Hello is this really new, kickass im system.&nbsp; The features are hot!&nbsp; It's got animated everything, file streaming instantly between you and up to 4 other people, and it connects ot Picasa (the last program I'm downloading).&nbsp; Picasa is a web imaging wizard.&nbsp; I already have like 3 other programs like it, but Picasa lets me put pictures online, so I can upload them to my blog.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My friend Tyler, no, not Taylor, this one's Tyler.&nbsp; Anyways, he's this awesome artist, and one of the things that he does is photography.&nbsp; He's got some awesome pictures that he's sent me, and I'm gonna be awesome and let everyone else see them in my blog!&nbsp; It's weird, my blog's really become addicting.&nbsp; I write in it everyday while I rock out to my 2003 warped tour CD.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So guess what else is new...&nbsp; My self piercing shit came in the mail today.&nbsp; I got 2 needles, a tongue barbell, a nose stud, and a pair of those tongue grabers.&nbsp; Can't quite remember what their called, something like forcepts...  &nbsp;  Oh well.&nbsp; I really wanna get it done today, and I can think of three people that might be able to do it.&nbsp; unfortunately all of them I'm not too close with, and I'm not sure if I completely trust them...&nbsp; Oh well, at least this isn't the piercing that I really need absolute trust and closeness with whoever.&nbsp; That one is a lot lower...  &nbsp;  Lol, maybe one day I'll be brave enough to consider that one.&nbsp; until then, I've got a ton more that I want to do with my ears!  &nbsp;  ~Ani

       Bored, sitting here, taking a break.&nbsp; From what u ask?&nbsp; Why, scripting, I reply!&nbsp; From my reply a question springs to life: What the hell is scripting?   Well, for all of you poor deprived people out their who don't know, scripting is really just writing up the script for something.&nbsp; In my case, I get the privilege and honor of writing up a base outline for the FVTC scholarship awards banquet.&nbsp; Twice each year, my mum has to type up around 70 some pages of stuff that people say.&nbsp; It's long, boring as hell, but if u get a scholarship, you are required to attend.&nbsp; Anyways, each time, my mom has to retype basically the same script, just making slight changes such as the recipient, donor, name/amount of scholarship, and any memoirs that go along with it.&nbsp; Then she collects all of the speaker's speeches, and inserts them into their appropriate spot.&nbsp; So anyways, me and my smart mouth just&nbsp;had to be getting annoyed that she's using my computer for like a week doing this stupid scripting.&nbsp; So I suggest that she just do a basic outline, or even better, just write up a program that asks you to type in   Category:  Scholarship:  Amount:  Donor:  Recipient (s):  Additional comments:   Then wham, bam, boom: you've got a fully scripted program that can be competed in only a few hours!&nbsp; Although the program would be fairly easy to write, she couldn't do it herself, and their wasn't anyone at work she could ask.&nbsp; Being the head of scholarship selection committee, it was her job to write script, so she didn't feel like she could ask the college for money to hire someone to write her up a little program jiggy.&nbsp; That's where I come in.&nbsp; I'm like, hey, why don't I just try to teach u a few basic computer commands, get u a book or two, and we'll go at it.&nbsp;   To all the computer geeks out there:&nbsp; "I'M SO SORRY!&nbsp; I HAD NO IDEA THAT WRITING SHIT ON THE COMPUTER AND ACTUALLY HAVING IT WORK WAS SO FUCKIN HARD!!!!"   After about 2 weeks, my mom's like, screw this.&nbsp; I'll just go back to the old fashioned long way...  But not me.&nbsp; I'm not the one to give up on a project so easily.&nbsp; So here's me and my good 'ole morals, attempting to write a lame ass program that doesn't even compare to what my brother can shoot out in about 30 min.&nbsp; And this has been taking all my time for like 30 days!&nbsp; Well, anyways I should probally go look something up online.&nbsp; I thought that if I got my mind off everything, I would just suddenly remember how to do shit again, but seeing how I still have no clue what I'm doing, it's not very likely.&nbsp;   Any help is appreciated!&nbsp;   Untill the next mental break down!&nbsp; :)   ~Ani

       So last night I decided to be stupid.&nbsp; I actually peirced my tounge!!!&nbsp; I was just freaking out at my mom, and the needle was there.&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; I thought that I was trying not to be impulsive, but i couldn't really help it.&nbsp; I had been thinking about doing it for along time, but I never thought I would actually have the guts to do it!&nbsp; The only problem is that I didn't get a long barbell.&nbsp; So the balls on each side are cutting down into my tounge, because it's so swollen.&nbsp; It's like a constant ache.&nbsp; I tried to eat, but that's not gonna happen again any time soon.&nbsp; I don't know what to do tonight when my mom come home.&nbsp; She's so gonna freak.&nbsp; I thought about just not telling her, but she would so notice my&nbsp;funny voice.&nbsp; And what am I going to do about work tomarrow?&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; hopefully it won't be as swollen by then.&nbsp;   Oh yeah, something of a little less importance, but still awsome:&nbsp; I also peirced my ears again.&nbsp; The lobes that is.&nbsp; Right above the first hole on each side.&nbsp; I think tonigh I'm gonna peirce another hole ontop of that one, so their will be three going up each side.&nbsp; I also wanna do my cartalige, but don't know what to put in it yet.&nbsp; I put horseshoe earings in my new holes, and they look hot.&nbsp; Maybe I'll go for either a full hoop, or just a plain stud.&nbsp; I really wanna peirce inside the ear, but I donno.&nbsp; The farther inside u get, the more dangerous it becomes.&nbsp; I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm so excited...&nbsp;The Bourne Supremecy come out tomarrow!&nbsp; I can't wait.&nbsp; I asked this one guy to go, but honestly,&nbsp;I don't think it's gonna work out.&nbsp; See, he's the kinda guy who never know's what he's gonna do tomarrow.&nbsp; Never plans ahead, never thinks ahead.&nbsp; Yeah, I know that I never think ahead either, but I can't fall asleep unless I know what I'm doing tomarrow.&nbsp; Me and him, we just don't mix like that.&nbsp; He's great to hang out with sparaticly, like a spur of the moment kind of thing, but I like talking to ppl on the phone, and making plans for next week, or even tomarrow.&nbsp; Then I have something to look forward to.&nbsp; But I also have this thing that if I ask someone to do something, I don't ask someone else, because what if they both end up saying yes?&nbsp; And I don't wanna call him and ask him again, cause I already did like 4 times today.&nbsp; My other friend really want's to go, but I don't wanna say yes to her, when I'm still "pending" with someone else.&nbsp; I know if I tell him about my problem, he'll just be like "Oh go with her!&nbsp; I don't care"&nbsp; and that makes me feel crapy, like he's just hanging out with me just because, and not like it's that big of a deal.&nbsp; I mean, I don't think it is, but i still care if he does.&nbsp; I'm such a hypocryte that can't spell!&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;  I'm gonna go nurse my tounge cause it hurts alot right now!  Luv ya,  ~Ani

       Why isn't anyone home?&nbsp; For the past two nights, I haven't really talked to anyone.&nbsp; It's been boring.&nbsp; I'm sad.&nbsp; But anyways...&nbsp; Today I went shoping for a planner and a longer tounge ring.&nbsp; I found one at Hot Topic for only $5!&nbsp; How cool is that?&nbsp; Well, when I got home, I tried to take the other one out, but Everything was so slipery and slimy, that I couldn't untwist one of the little balls.&nbsp; They were both digging so deep into my tounge...&nbsp; It hurt like hell.&nbsp; There were even tears in my eyes!&nbsp; Well, eventually, after a while of turmoile, I succeded in unscrewing a ball.&nbsp; (omg, how bad does that sound?)&nbsp; I took the barbell out, and I couldn't really even feel the other one go in!&nbsp; So I now have a new barbell in, and it actually fits!&nbsp; I think it's really cool cause it has a jem thingy embeded in it, and it's not embeded in my tounge!&nbsp; Well, I'm kinda hungry, and the swelling's almost gone.&nbsp; My tounge doesn't hurt as much anymore, so I think that I'm going to go try and eat something.&nbsp; Just one more thing though, I sound funny when I talk.&nbsp; It's so anyoing, and embaressing.&nbsp; I can't properly pronounce my c's and s's.&nbsp; It sucks, and I can't even say it!&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp;  Later then...  ~Ani

       I had a horriable night's sleep last night.&nbsp; I kept waking up.&nbsp; As soon as I got home from work, I went to my room.&nbsp; I don't know exactally when I fell asleep, but it was something like 9ish.&nbsp; Then, at midnight, my phone rang.&nbsp; I went to answer it, but no one was there.&nbsp; I tried to fall back to sleep, but woke up at 2 to go to the bathroom, but because my potty doesn't work, I had difficulties.&nbsp; I didn't want to go all the way upstairs, so I tried to fix it, and ended up making a mess.&nbsp; The water started coming out of the bottom, and the carpet as well as my feet got soaking wet.&nbsp; I just decided to turn off the water.&nbsp; I stripped off my clothes, way to tired by now to actually change.&nbsp; Seeing how it was like 4 in the morning, that's completely understandable.&nbsp;  Around 7am, my mom came down to wake me up, because I had a doctor appt. at 8:30.&nbsp; So we drove to Oshkosh both still half asleep.&nbsp; After waiting for like an hour, I saw the doc, all went well, and we were out by 10.&nbsp; I was hungry, so my mum and I went over to ihop.&nbsp; The food their is ok.&nbsp; Not my fav, but not like puck it all up cause it's so gross...&nbsp; After eating, we stoped into walgreens to get some nessecities, and then the bank so i could get some $.  My mom dropped me off at like 11:00.&nbsp; I went straight to bed.&nbsp; now it's 12:30, and I'm waking up again.&nbsp; Well, off to face the day again!  ~Ani

       I haven't written in like forever man!  So many things have changed.  I'm working little by little on this really awsome poem.  It's totaly heartfelt, and completely honest.  I'm scared to show it to anyone though, because it reveals something terriable.  I know that when the person who it's ment for reads it we will have to have a very long, and painful talk.  And I also know that after that talk, I probally will lose a very good friend.  Even if they forgive everything, things will never be the same.  Why do I always have to fuck everything up?  I have extrordinary things going for me, and I screw up every time.  No matter what the situation is, I end up the loser.  And in the end, I feel the urge to come clean.  To push back away, ultimently destroying any type of relationship that I had managed to build up.  It's almost as if I purpously do something wrong every time, just so I can fall back on it.  I hide something, lie about something, or screw up something, so when I start getting too close to a person, I can use whatever I with held as an excuse as to why we can't be friends anymore.  I push everyone away because I get sick of trying so damn hard to keep them their.   Many  people have told me that I am the best friend anyone could ever have.  I'm kind, considerate, caring, understanding, I listen, give great advice, joke around, know how to have fun...  I'm everything that you would want in a friend.  At least that's what everyone tells me.  But it's hard to do and be all that.  It takes a tremendous amount of effort.  And I never see the payback.  I never see any benifits.  I work harder to be a friend then they do, so I always end up feeling burned.   It's funny though how this goes in a circle.  No one else is a great friend to start out with except me.  They need to be able to get close to me before then can start caring as much as I do.  However, I always start out where they are trying to get.  As I become a better friend, I always stay one step ahead of them, which makes me feel like shit because I don't get back what I give.   On the flip side, if I don't start out giving my all, I never seem to get friends.  I've always heard "you have to be a friend to have a friend"  While, I am a friend.  I'm a great friend.  And I do have many friends.  But none are up to par with me.  Now how conceted does that sound?  See, I really am an awful person.  But does stating the truth always mean your awfule?  Now I'm not saying that I am, but hypotheticly, what if I really was better then everyone else?  Would it still be conceted of me to say that I was?  I mean, if it were hypotheticly true, I wouldn't be lying.  But I guess we'd have to get into the matter of opinion.  And who's judging, or counting...  Well, enough thinking for now.  I don't know what to do.   Reveal the poem, or keep things going how they are?  I'll decide later...  ~Ani

       I need to shower.  I still smell like DQ!  Not to mention sweat, blood, and tears.  I don't know where the tears came from, I just have random emotional break downs.  The blood is from last night.  My dog pushed me off my bed, and I smashed my head against the bookcase corner.  Now this morning, I wake up, feel my head, and I'm like, Shit!  What the hell, their's this huge bump.  I go over to the mirror to check it out, and it's all black and blue around it.  This sucks.  And it's not like I can even cover it up to well.  Oh well.  Hopefully it will go away later.

       Guess where I am right now???  New York City!!!  How fun!!!  I'm here visiting my brother.  He's got the coolest appartment.  We just got back from hanging out around the city today.  Right now, I'm stitting on his couch listening to the music outside.  Their having a block party, and it's LOULD!!!!  Earlier this afternoon, they had a barbacue.  The music has been going on for about 5 hours so far. and Mike (my brother) said that these things usally starte dying down around 1am.  There were some pretty cute guys outside his apartment earlier.  I'm thinking about maybe going out and dancing later.  Who knows...  Anyways, we saw the funniest thing earlier.  There was a group of motercycleists all riding together, and we noticed that they each had a seperate helmet strapped on to their back seat.  My brother made a crack about how they were probally for the ladies that they were trying to pick up, although none of them hade seemed to accomplished that yet...  Oh well.  It was still early...    All today, my parents have been complete crabs.  They were bitching at me all day about everything.  They are completely anal too!  I mean, I realize that they haven't slept in a while, but it's not like it's my fault, so why take it out on me?!?!?!  Gesh.  Parents...  What can u do?  Lol.  I suppose that I'm gonna go outside now.  Their playing some good R&B right now, and I actually reconize some of the songs.  Their's a DJ and everything.  The mixer alone has to be a couple thousand...  Why dont' they spend their money on something more productive?  Well, if having fun means that much, who am I to argue?  Besides, I'm benifiting from it all, so who's complaning?   Later,  Ani

       It's like 1:30 here in New York, but only a little after midnight back home.  I don't understand why everyone isn't online.  I tried calling some of my friends earlier, but no one answered.  Maybe that's because the three that I tried to call all have caller ID.  I was calling from my brother's cell phone, so maybe they didn't want to pick up a call from someone out of town, or lond distance.  I donno.  Maybe it was just because they didn't know the number so they thought that I was a telemarketer or something.  I donno.  Like I said before, I'm getting a little sleepy, but I don't know why really because I slept all day in the car.  I'm bored.  My brother isn't being too much fun.  But this really is alot better then being with my parents.  Hopefully after a good night's sleep, they won't be so craby tomarrow.  They were really bitchy today.  Oh well.  At least it was somewhat understandable.  I suppose I should cut them alittle slack, I mean, we are on vacation afterall, but on the flip side, I think that they should cut me some slack.  I am getting to be too old to go on family vacations.  I just wanna stay home and hang out with my friends.  Maybe next time, they'll let me stay home alone.    I feel kinda bad about asking for the next three weekends off at work.  The next one, I'll be coming home from this trip, the weekend after that, I'm gonna be babysitting overnight for the Carabello's.  Hopefully, this will prove to my parents that I am old enough to stay home alone.  I mean, after all I will be staying by myself, and taking care of two kids.  How exciting is that!  Anyways, the weekend after that, we are going to be going back to Winona for labor day weekend.  Then I think that I am gonna have to go back to school.    School.  It's coming up pretty soon.  Next tuesday, the one after I get back from here, it's regestration at school.  I think that Amanda and I are gonna go together, but I'm not sure yet.  I haven't really had a chance to talk to her.  Besides, That night I'm gonna have to go right to work afterwards, so maybe that will be a good thing if she works, but it also might be just another reason why we can't do anything on tuesday.  I donno.  She's a pretty cool person usally.  Sometimes she can be a little braty, girly, mean and selfish, but i know that everything she does, she does in good faith, and humor.  It seems like she's always smiling, just like me.  And she's got tons of friends because she's usally so nice.  I just remembered something that I was thinking before.  Maybe when my parents go to Winona, I'll be able to stay home by myself.  I mean, I did have to suffer through them on this vacation, and I will be proving myself the weekend before at the Carabello's house...  Oh the possabilities....  The aproatch is going to be tricky though.  Prehaps, I should put on a game face this week, try to make the best of everything, and not really piss them off.  Then, when we get home, in the middle of the week, I should bring up the possibilitiy of staying by myself.  I can bring up the fact that starting off with the Carabello's would be a good begining, and also that I would be able to get used to freedom's and responsabilities that come with being home alone.  I've been longing for freedom, and for them to trust me enough to stay alone for the entire weekend!!!!  OH  how wonderful does that sound.  I will have to be very careful and persice in my planning though.  Bring up the topic at just the right time, have my arguments carefully planned out and everything...  I'll start thinking right now.  I don't want to get my hopes up or anything, but think of the possabilities!!!!!  I'll do some more thinking on the subject and report back later!!  Lol,  Ani

       That's where I am tonight.  And it only took like 3 hours to get here from NYC.  That is after we got out of the city.  The trafic on the expressway outside of The Bronx was awful.  I donno why, but I suppose it always is...    Anyways, I'm staying at the the SeaPort Inn.  It's pretty nice here.  We have a suite, which means it has a seperate bedroom.  My parents get that one.  My brother gets the bed outside that, and I get the sofa bed in the living room part.  We also have a mini kitchenett which has basicly just a sink, coffee maker, microwave, and the ever so popular Minibar!  The bathroom is really nice this time too.  Their's a huge tub with jets and everything, so it's like a mini jacuzie!  Their's also a seperate glass shower, and a huge counter with a bowl sink that is awsome.  The water comes out of this pipe horizontal, so it kinda looks like a river, then drops off like a waterfall.  It's really neat.  I donno why, but whenever we go to hotels, we always end up spending alot on a room that's more then we need.  I wish that we could have just gotten 2 regular rooms, then I could actually have my own bed, and I wouldn't have to listen to my dad snore.  It's so fucking lould, not to mention anoying at 3 in the mornign.    Speaking of anoying, this whole family vacation thingy is really starting to piss me off.  It seems that everything my parents do is embaressing, or stupid or something.  I wish that they would just shut their fucking mouths sometimes.  I know that they think the exact same thing about me because they tell me all the time.  And they always complaine that they are tired.  And u know what being tired means: being craby and a pain in the ass.  I just wish that I was home.  This week is never going to end.  How boring is it to be stuck in some lame ass town in the middle of fucking nowhere with your family?  You know what else, someone reading this will be like: shut up, u go everywhere with your family, you're such a spoiled little brat!  But if putting up with my parents alone in the car for over 20 hours straight is something that makes me lucky, then whoever thinks that is the one who's fucked up, not me...  I just want to be home with my friends for the end of the summer.  I mess everyone so much, and I haven't even been gone all that long yet.  It's just that whenever I can find time to go on a computer, no one is ever on.  And it'll take me all day of doing shit for my brother just to be able to make a call on his cell,   I gotta go, but i'll write later  ~Ani

       That's where I am again tonight!!!!  How much fun!!!  So today was awsome.  I got up pretty early this morning.  Well, more like 10:30, but hey, that's pretty damn early for me!  Anyways, we went down to China Town for Dim Sum.  For all of you ethnicly chalenged people, Dim Sum is a Chinese type of meal.  People come around to your table with small portions of food.  Then they ask you if you want some.  If you say yes, they give you a plate for your table, and stamp a card on your table.  Usally they serve things like dumplings, Egg roles, Shrimp/chicken/pork/beef pot stickers, oysters, toasts, and of course, my favorite: chicken feet!  YUMMY!!!  So we racked up a pretty hefty bill at our table this morning, gouging ourselves full of food.  Then we walked around China town for a while.  Just getting off the subway is an amazing thing.  One second you're above ground in Times Square.  You go down, and when you emerge again, It's like you're in another world!  And you practiclaly are!  Everything is written in Chinese, and hardly anyone there speaks English.  It always helps if your with a bilingual person when u go down there.  Mari for instance is great, cause she spent 2 years in China durring college.  She's my brother's ex also, but extreamly nice and outgoing.   Anyways, we shoped around in China town.  Slowly, we started moving from one neighbor hood to another: Soho.  The preppy, trendy, upscale shopping district!    OMG, you should have seen some of the stores that we went into.  They were so fancy.  The dresses cost a couple thousand $ each!  And the ppl who worked their were all so profesional.  It was kinda cool.  We also saw alot of outside cafes packed with little tables and chairs.  Everyone walking on the street was wearing something colorful and original, completely unlike downtown NYC where everyone is in black.  Soho totally reminded me of shoping in Paris on Grande Ave.  Every store was upscale and the culture and ppl were so intresting.  Soho leads right into Tribahcah.  Another neighborhood full of wonderful shopping.  Although, in Tribahcah, it's not so much just clothes shoping anymore.  Their's everything.  Everything upscale and classy that is.  This is where you would come to buy a $5,000 leather sofa for your loft.  The stores were so little and cute, but still had that sophisticated flare that I love so much...  Anyways, when we were done with all that shopping, we decided to go to a bar and have a few drinks.  Now of course I can't drink, and I ordered a Margerita, thinking that the bartender would know to make it a virgen, but that's not what I got...  The thing tasted sortta bitter, and most definantly not like any of the margarita's that I am used to back in Appleton.  But I figured that the hell with it, so I drank it all, and asked for another one.  Judging by how fast I inhaled the first one, the bartender must have thought that I could hold my liquer or something, because I think he made my second one a doubble.  About half way through my second Margerita, that familiar feeling hit me.  I was getting a major buzz.  Shit, this can't be good, I never told my brother that it had alchohol in it, and now here I am, on the verge of getting drunk.  I suggested that we go to a restruant now, and get something to eat, because my stomach was starting to feel funny.  He agreed, and we went down the street to Supper.  It was an Italian restruant with an outdoor cafe.  We sat inside though, because we had a big group.  Everyone ordered, and the apatizers came.  Mike ordered like a $100 bottle of wine, and the waiter came and poured it for him to taste.  It was all so elegant with the napkin wraped around the bottle and everything.  Then he poured it for everyone, including me.  Mike noticed, but didn't say anything untill the waiter was gone.  He said that I could have one glass, after all, it was vacation and all.  So we were eating and filling up with appitizers, and everyone just kept ordering more bottles of wine.  After the first $100 bottle, they decided to stick to the lower 30's, but that still got expensive after 2 more bottles.  When our food finally came, everyone was getting thirsty again, and our waiter suggested that we get a few pitchers of Sangrea.  That's like wine, mixed with fruit juices, and other stuff.  The good stuff also has fruit chunks and peices floating around in it.  I guess Mike thought that was a good idea, because he ordered like 3 pitchers.  The waiter brought them, and with all the noise, laughter, and eating going on, no one seemed to mind me taking a sip every  now and then...  Anyways, after eating, drinking, laughing, talking, and sitting for about 4 hours there, we decided that it was time to leave.  Everyone was quite drunk by now, and no one noticed that I was tipsey as well.  It was about midnight, too early to go home, but to late do really do anything else.  So we decided to hit a Starbucks for some coffee, and head off to the Virgin Mega Store.  The Virgin Mega Store is in Union Square in the center of downtown.  It's a huge media store.  the whole first floor is full of music.  Punk, Pop, Rap, Rock, Jazz, Bluegrass, Oldies, and everything else that u can think of.  As far as you can see, it's all music.  Then their the downstairs floor.  This one is split in half, but it's also about twice the size of the upstairs.  Their's this one huge section just for DVD's.  I think they have every DVD ever made their.  And if you can't find it, they have everything computerized, so you can search by whatever catagory you want.  If by some fluke, they don't have what you want, you can order it, and have it shiped to your house with in 24 hours, free of charge.  I'm telling you, I could have spent hours in this store, but unfortauntly it was a Sunday night, so they closed around 1am.  Or at least that's when they stoped letting people in.  I don't think they ever really close, because the employies praticlaly live their.    After we were done at Virgin, we decided to call it a night and head home.  I said good bye to Mike's friends, and we headed off to the subway.  It took us about an hour to get home, just because we had to wait so long for the train, and we also had 100 blocks uptown to go!   As soon as we got home, I checked my messages.  I'm am really starting to miss all of my friends.  It sucks.  I can't get a hold of anyone.  Taylor has had the same away message for 2 days, and no one is answering his phone, I'm not home early enough to call Sami or Mel, Sami's never online, and Dave said that Mel is going to be offline for like a week or something.  So here I am, stuck talking to Dave, Ben, Adam, Kristina, and Keyan.  What fun.  Just kidding guys, you know I love you, but I still wanna talk to more people!!!!!   How about Chris actually getting his ass online for a second, or Amanda actually picking up her cell?  And as for Nicole checking her messages, that'll be a mericle.  Alex, I miss him too.  I don't know why, but he always knows just what to say to make me smile, and always know's when to back off me if I'm pissed.  He's such a sweetie.  And u know who else I really wanna talk too?  Jake.  J/K.  I know Jake isn't the meanest guy in the world, but he's easy to forget about for a while.  I need a break from him.  I still love him too though!!!  I feel so out of touch with my friends, even though I've only been gone like 2 days!!!  I don't know what I'm gonna do tomarrow, or for the rest of the week, cause I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to get online!!!!  What a horror that would be!!!!  I just need to keep talking to people, cause I know it sounds crazy and stupid, but what if they actually forget about me?  Or what if no one misses me, and everyone could care less that I am gone?  I feel like I have to remind everyone that I still exist, and that life is really better with  me in it...  I Donno, maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I still would hate for that to happen.  Their's one person in paticular that I dont' want to forget about me.  They will remain nameless for the sake of secrecy, but I miss them like crazy.  If they were here with me, I don't think that anything would be so bad.  I mean, I wouldn' miss everyone as much.  But as I'm sitting here typing at 3am, I'm wondering if they even miss me.  I don't think so.  Their probally just sleeping, dreaming about someone else, not even caring that we havent talked in a while.  It really hurts just to think of that.  The unknown.  Not knowing what they think about me.  Not knowing if my feelings for them will ever be returned.  The worst feeling in the world is loving someone, and not having them return it.  Looking into their eyes every day, knowing that they will never feel the way you do.  It tears me apart just thinking about it.  I want to cry everytime I think about them with someone other then me.  I don't know what to do, don't know how to act, don't know how to feel.  Do I tell them how I feel?  Will they even care?  No.  I already know that answer.  They don't care how I feel about them, because they already have their mind made up.  Even if anything ever changes between us, it'll still suck because I'll be the consolation prize.  Second, third, fourth, or even the hundreth runner up.  I keep giving, giving, giving.  Not asking for anything, hoping with all  my heart to get just something, and nothing happens.  I know that I should just move on and forget, but I've tried, and I can't.  I can't overpower my heart.  I don't know why.  I can't choose who I like, who I have a crush on, and I hate it.  It pisses me off, but I can't control a damn thing.   My rant's getting long, and I'm tired.  I'll try to write again when I can, but I don't know when I'll be around a computer, let alone internet...    Untill them, maybe that certin person from above will change how they feel about me...  Hey, I can hope and dream, can't I?  ~Ani

       I don't want to be here anymore.  I want to go home.  My family is bugging me so much right now.  I can't take it.  And all I've been doing for the past 2 hours is cry.  This one guy that I liked is now going out with my ex best friend.  Although she still sortta has a boyfriend, who i hooked her up with by the way...  Anyways, one night earlier this month, she calls me all in a tither because she wants to have sex with him, and she wanted advice.  So I talked to her, and listened to her forever talk about her perdicament.  She told me how much she loved him, and how much she trusted him, and would never want to break up with him.  Now she pulls a stunt like this.  Kissing another guy in her backyard, while she still has a boyfriend.  Oh yeah, and she was well aware that I liked this guy, but did that seem to bother her?  No.  That, to me anyways, is about as low as u can sink.  Cheating on your boyfriend, and hurting one of your best friends who's been their for you for everything all at the same time.    I can not even begin to describe how hurt I was when i found out that tonight.  He broke the news to me about 2 hours ago, and I still haven't stoped crying.  I don't know why, but their's just something about this one guy that really attracted him to me, and now he likes my friend, who i introduced him too.  I feel so used.  And hurt, but I already said that one.  I dont' even know what to type.  I can't go to bed because I'm such a wreck, and i'm in the middle of freaking nowhere.  I have no one to talk to, so i'm putting it all down on paper, but nothing's helping.  I'm begining to feel that familiar old feeling.  The one where I'm helpless, and in so much pain, and can't cope with the realization that their's nothing that i can do about it.  And u know what i did before when that feeling kicked in?  I went into the bathroom, pulled up my shirt sleve, took a razorblade out of the drawer, pressed it against my wrist, and pulled.    As I watched the blood drip down, it was calming.  There was a soothing effect.  Just thinking about it is calming.  And I know that their's a razor blade upstairs in my backpack.  I always carry one with me still; just out of habbit.  Something inside of me is urging me to go upstairs and get it, but I can't.  I promised myself, and so many other people that I would never do that again.  But one of the people I promised that to was my friend I was talking about earlier.  So what does that promise mean anymore?  nothing, so all in all, would it be ok?  No.  I know the answer.  I'm not that stupid.  Even if i think blood is cool, I would never be an idiot.    My god.  I just was mulling over this with my friend, the guy from above, and his reaction: "Fuck you.  Bye".  I don't know what I did!  Now he's not talking to me, and all my problems are coming back.  Whatever.  If he's gonna be that insensitive to my problems, and not even listen to a reason, then he's not the friend I thought he was.  Shit.  I thought the crying had stoped, but it hasn't.  Here comes another tidle wave.  Fuck him and his drama then.  I dont' need ppl like that to fuck things up for me anymore.  I'm going to sleep  ani

       So yesterday, I wrote like 5,000 words.  When I was finished, I the computer  shut down, closing out all of my programs.  I was pissed at first, but now I'm thinking that it might have been a good thing, because I was so angry and frusterated when I was typing before.  I wrote alot of shit that would probally hurt alot of people if they ever read it.  I have a really bad habbit of pissing people off when I'm in a bad mood, just because I don't think before I say something.  That's what happened the other night.  I said some shit, not meaning any of it, I was just trying to get some feelings out, and one of my friends that I was talking to got really pissed at me, because I said that I felt like breaking my promise to one of my otherfriends.  The promise was that I would never cut again.  So I told him that and he's like "Fuck you, don't ever talk to me again".  I couldn't belive it.  I was so depressed when he said that.  He didn't even get a chance to hear me out, or even talk to me about it.  He just left...  But I mean, now that I got over the sadness part, I'm starting to get really pissed at him.  What kind of friend gets pissed at someone when they say that they want to cut, or hurt themselves?  I would expect him to be mad because I said that I would never do that again, but to get as pissed as he did?  That's just not cool.  Not to mention a horriable friend.  He just blocked me, with out even asking if I really was going to do something.  Not woried about me at all.  There was only one feeling that was presented to me, and that was one of anger.  Lots of anger.    The only thing that I could phanthom was that he was angry because he thought that I was only pretending to want to cut again to get back at him for liking and kissing one of my other friends.  But even that's a strech.  I don't think he would come up with something as crazy as that.  But I really don't know.  I just can't belive that he would just get so mad, and not even talk to me about it.  And belive me, I tried to talk to him one night online, and I asked him why he was mad at me.  I also said that I saw no reason for it, and that he was being weird.  That got him pissed and he blocked me.  I sent in reinforcements, but they just got fried and burned.  So I gave up for a while.  Thinking that if he had some time to cool off, maybe he'd listen to me, and would be able to explain a few things to me.    But one thing he's gotta get straight, is that just because I don't understand the inner workings of his mind, doesn't mean that I'm stupid.  And if he just assumed to know what I was feeling, then that was the first mistake that he made.  I don't think anyone, not even the person who knows me the best could figure out what I was thinking, and how I was feeling that night.  I don't even know.  That's because I don't think it was me talking.  I mean, I was always discugsted and appaled that anyone would want to harm themselves by cutting, or comiting suicide, but look at the shit I did.  Now that I look back on it, I cringe, because that's not me.  That's not how I act, or think.  Everyone that remotley knows me knows that I'm not like that.  What I did, I couldn't control.  It really wasn't me doing those things.  It's taken me a while to accept that fact, and come to terms with it, but I think it's going to take even longer for my friends to accept that.  I think that they are gonna want a reason for why I did what I did.  I used to want a reason, but I don't have one, and that's ok with me now.  I lived everything out.  Got wise beyond my years, and put it behind me.  I suppose that with out the experience of actually going through, and living what I lived, it's harder to understand and accept.  Whatever.  Hepefully I'll talk things out with him tonight, and it'll all be better.  Besides, he still has both of my PS2 games and my skateboard, plus he owes me like $70!!!  He better not be ditching me just so he doesn't have to pay me back.  If that's the case, I'll really be pissed!  Well, off to dinner.  I'll write late tonight, or tomarrow to tell how it all goes.  With my luck, I probally won't even get ahold of the bastard!!!  Anyways, ta ta untill then!  ~ANI

       Ahhh!  So many hours!  I work every day this week.  Sunday off, but then every day again next week.  Finally, I though that alittle relif was coming the next weekend, but it was only then did I realize that I had off so  I could do an overnight babysitting thing.  I suppose that if we had to look at this in a good way, one would come up with the conclution that I'd be making alot of money, and I would finally be able to afford a computer or something.  But the more I think about it, the less I really want a computer.  I mean, why waste my money on something like that.  It doesn't really make all that much sense, because I have a perfectly good computer right here.  After I stoped downloading music and shit from online, this computer's been completely virus free!  And what's even better is that I have my own account so that means that I can make my desktop look like whatever I want.  Right now, I have this really cool spacey bubbles theme, it rocks.   Well, enough talk about computers.  So if my paycheck this Wed is only gonna be like $70 cause I was out of town, that's ok I guess.  I just won't put anything into savings this time.  I'll just start to pay my mum back.  I owe her like $100.  It sucks being in debt.  Oh well.  I'll get out of it eventually.  I also don't like being on the other end either, like with this one friend, he owes me $70.  I just wish that I could clear it up, and worry about something else.  I mean, what's money anyways.  A peice of green paper that smells really bad?!?!?!  Hey, have you ever actually smelt money?  I mean, really put it right up to your nose and smelt it?  Wow does that stuff wreak!!!  Gross.  Son next paycheck, the one in two days is gonna be kinda small.  Well, not kinda small, but really stinking itty bitty small.  But that' ok, because in two weeks from now, it's gonna be huge!!!  Working every day for 2 weeks!  Wow.  I'm gonna go count up my hours right now.   50 hours!  50 hours times $6 per hour is  $300!!!!!  Wowwie that's alot of money.  It'll be enough to pay back my mom, put some in my bank account, plus still have spending money!!!  How hot is that.  I'm excited now.  I guess that working does have it's perks.  I love my job though.  I mean, like tonight for example, I get done at 10:45, and I went to Taco Bell with Gina, Melanie, and Kristin.  We all got to eat some really good food, and sat there and just talked for about an hour.  I got home at midnight, and luckily my mom wasn't home.  She's out of town at some buisness thing.  But my dad was home, and he never really cares about anything.  As long as I don't do anything stupid, he could care less.  I think he did mention somethin about calling him, but who knows, and who really cares.  Maybe I should start to care alittle more, because if I keep not showing up when I'm supposed to, they're not gonna let me go out when ever I want to.  Speaking of going out, Rachel's mom came in today, because Rachel was supposed to work, but she ended up trading with Melanie, so Rachel we all just assumed, went home.  But when her mom came in and asked where she was, we were all just like, umm...  Boy was her mom mad that Rachel didn't call.  But I don't even think that it crossed Rachel's mind to, because she was gonna be out of the house anyways, what difference does it make where she is.  She's lucky though, cause her mom's really cool, and really loose about the rules.  I mean, she doesn't even have a curfue.  I'm jelous.  Usally I'm supposed to be home by 11.  10 on a weeknight.  I think that durring the school year, it's gonna be 11 on the weekends, and 9 on a school night, if that even.  But so will lots of other ppls, and I don't wanna be totally dead for school the next day.  As long as we're talking about being dead, or I guess I'm writing about it, I don't wanna wake up so late tomarrow, cause I have regestration for school.  So I'm gonna hit the sack.    Later  ~Ani
