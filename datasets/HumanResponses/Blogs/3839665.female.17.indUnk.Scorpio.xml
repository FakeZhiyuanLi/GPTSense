      Today Susan and I drove to Downers Grove and went to their downtown.  We bought semi matching patchwork hippie skirts.  I love mine, it smells like incense.  Then we drove to Lisle and after walking precisely one block my brother called and said I needed to go see my therapist RIGHT NOW.  I had forgotten about my appointment .  Stupid me, every time I let down my guard I forget about something important.  Anyways, Susan and I wore our skirts in downtown Naperville and I had time to contemplate many things. 1. Why do people smoke? 2. What allows people to become corrupt so quickly once they become rich or powerful? 3. Why can't we all appreciate what we've been given? 4. Nature is omnipotent. 5. Both nature and music are existant everywhere. 6. Life is strange but people are stranger.  I'm leaving Saturday morning on the 8:45 plane to Vermont and I won't be back until August 23rd.  I'll miss you all.  Have tons of fun without me.  I couldn't live without the written word.

      I'm reading a hilarious book called Sick Puppy.  And it really has nothing to do with puppies, sick or otherwise.  It's a muckraking book filled with environmentalism and I love it.  Last night people came over for craft night, though we didn't really do any crafts.  Mike Dunford came too and we (or maybe just I) decided he gets to be the honorary male member of our craft club with old ladies.  I also discovered yesterday the Red Hat Society.  Look it up, I swear it's a cult.  In addition I watched Princess Bride at 1 in the morning, cooked revel bars and watched Susan get her hair cut.  I really need to do something crazy before I leave on Saturday or I will snap, no joke.  Do I want to go to Homecoming this year?  Question of the Post: Would you rather cook or garden and why?

      Yesterday was my mother's birthday.  My brother was a brat as he usually is during special events are more recently all the time.  I can't sleep well anymore.  My zine is copied in black and white on the computer so I should be able to print it soon when I find out how many copies I need.  SCA is soon, I'm excited but not really.  Susan and I are making crafts tonight.  I need to go outside.  Life is too short.

      I am going to make a resolution here and now.  Who waits for New Years anyways?  I will simplify my life in order to create peace and harmony and better appreciate myself and to better accomplish my goals.  I will:  *do the Womens Warrior Workout every other day in order to achieve inner and outer strength *meditate and do a journey on the same days I do the video workout *bike, walk, run or participate in some other form of cardio workout on days I am not strength training *give up soda *drink more tea instead of soda *sleep at regular times in order to establish a normal body clock *be motivated *realize it is ok to mess up sometimes  This is reasonable, right?  With all bloggers as my witnesses, I will do my best to stick to this new lifestyle and let it change me for the the better as much as possible.  Question of the Post: What decision can you make right now to add peacefulness to your life?

      Last night I went with my mother to her friend and coworker's photography show.  It was quite marvelous and inspiring, called Girl. and thought provoking.  I suggest you all go and see it, the show continues today through Sunday at 14 W. Downers in Aurora.  Going to shows such as that and the one last weekend at the Fat Bean make me realize how much I love culture.  I love people that love what they do.  You can see it in their eyes and hear it in their voice and they have so much pride in their art/music/writing.  What I'm trying (not very eloquently) to say is that this is where my soul is, this underground culture filled with vibrant people that have not sold their souls for profit and find beauty where most can't, inspiration where most observe a wasteland.  It takes great strength to share yourself through a medium such as art, music or writing for your soul shines through.  Which brings me to my zine.  If anyone would like one, please email me at envirosprite@wowway.com as soon as possible so I know how many to copy.  I rethought my exposure method and decided I'm not going to give them out randomly because most will probably be tossed and I would rather have a few people read it and enjoy it than many see it and not take time to read it.  It is called A Surreptitious Dandelion, #1 I suppose though #2 is in the making.  Question of the Post: What is your favorite way of expressing yourself?  Oh, and Jai Smith rocks, she is definitely one of the cool people from the title, her blog is -jane-doe-.blogspot.com.  Go there!

      I did my strength workout video again and now I'm really sore.  But it will be worth it- 8 days and 16.5 hours until I leave for Vermont!!!!!!!!  And I talked to my crew leader Emily last night for half an hour, she seems really cool and I know even if I don't get along with anyone else on the trip (which is doubtful) I'll be able to talk to her.  We need to party Thursday or Friday night before I leave so I can see everyone before school starts!  So I'm leaving random comments again on people's blogs/livejournals.  It's fun though, you all should do it.  Question of the post: What is the wierdest thing a stranger has ever asked?

      This morning I went shopping with my mother.  Both of us generally abhor shopping, but we went to REI and Galyans, both outdoor clothing and stuff, so I loved it.  All of my SCA items are now present, I only need to visit Justus and abduct his sleeping bag.  Question of the Post: Where is your favorite place to shop?  (Yeah I know that's the ditziest question ever, I don't care)  Oh, and I went to see Mean Girls at Ogden 6 AGAIN last night.  What a humerous movie...I shouldn't like it so much but I do.  What can I say, chick flicks are addictive.

      are full of restlessness.  I woke up, intending to go volunteer at the Farm and found it was cloudy and seemingly rainy.  So I didn't go and instead sat around my house.  Almost all of my SCA stuff is together, so I went through and inventoried that just to make sure.  I'm excited, the 24th can't come soon enough.  I watched too much tv today though, and I haven't in a long time so it just felt strange, disconnected and lazy.  Blah.  On a better note, I did the Womens Warrior Workout tape because I need to be "strong like bull" when I leave for Vermont.   We'll see how that goes...

      I got my zine that I sent away for today in the mail.  I love it and I love the whole culture that comes with zines.  It's a girl who's 21 and lives in Texas, her zine is called Option Paralysis.  Such things as this are beautiful and real, the underground grassroots culture that comes with such a thing.  I'm making a zine, it shall be called A Surreptitious Dandelion and once I photocopy it, my words will fly into the world.  And now for the question of the post (I decided this is a better way to get you all to comment):      If you created a zine, what would it's name be and how would your intro explain this name?   Zine: a personally published bunch of writing/drawing that can range from a journal to rantings to a comic, basically anything that floats your boat

        Youre the wolf of fire! You are the one who is most likely to be a leader. The wolf of fire has a deep passion for almost anything and is very noble. They are athletic and rough but are still tender on the inside. These are probably not the most rare type but they are still very special. A fire wolf is such a cool being the way they eat and hunt together. If you are the fire wolf then you are very social and proud although you are not always loyal. But, still being the fire wolf is a good thing because they are strong and do most things independently.     urlLink   What Elemental Wolf Are You?

      While walking to my car after work, I noticed several triumphs of the human spirit.  Several teenagers had sidewalk chalked the area around the fountain with whimisical drawings and sayings, something I do occasionally that makes me smile and rejoice when other do the same.  In addition a group of people were jamming (I use that word loosely because I techinically do not know what the word implies since I don't play myself) on accoustic guitars next to the river.  Such actions as these keep the possibility alive that not all hope is lost.  I'm only working Friday night this week so I want to party.

      Susan and I went to a show at The Fat Bean last night.  It rocked my socks, and now I love Stomp Aberdeen.  They had incredible amounts of energy and it was the most fun I've ever had at a local show in my life.  Rock on!

      But I do.  And do I really want it?  No, I bet if I had it I wouldn't want it any longer.  It's just the idea that's so appealing.    You have a free soul! As all the souls go, yours is the most free-spirited and adventurous. You like camping, hiking, or interaction with other people. Your a social butterfly, but not because of your style, but because of your willingness to communicate with everyone. You probably have close friends who can rely on you because you always seem to know whats going on in the world. You love music and are free-spirited and someone fun to be around. A born leader and great explorer-dont ever change-the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

      I went to Mejer (is that how you spell it?) for the first time today and I hated it as much as I believed I would.  It's just a huge warehouse full of stuff that most people think they need but really don't.  I hate materialism, it's breaking apart our world.  The values that America was founded on are strong and wonderful, such as freedom and equality, but these have been replaced by materialism and a need to have more.  More stuff, more money, more people to surround yourself with.  And this is not what life should be about.  On another note, only two weeks and 17 hours until I will be leaving to go on the plane to live and work in Vermont for the rest of the summer.  I should be really excited but I'm trying not to have any expectations whatsoever so that I can't be disappointed and CAN be pleasantly surprised.  It's kind of working.  If anyone has anything they want to do before July 24th though, call me.  I'm up for anything and I want to party before I go and live in the woods and disappear from everyone's lives.

      Today was Lauren and Susan's adventure in the city.  We walked along the lake in what I found out afterwards to be a "dangerous part of the city".  Oh wait, first we took the trolley.  Then we had lunch at Au Bon Pain- a french cafe place and i had quite a few scrumptious salads.  Wabash happened to house more than a few interesting stores, especially a clothing store called Ragstock that was half used clothing, half new.  All very cheap and wonderful.  I got a burgandy velvet jacket and the Rock Against Bush cd from Tower Records.  Everyone should go to Chicago frequently, it was a lovely experience.

      Yeah, i'm not allowed to give blood anymore because I threw up today right after they stuck the needle in.  Why does God make it so hard for me to help other people?  And the first time I gave blood I passed out, the second time they stuck the needle in wrong so they had to do both arms.  Obviously I'm not supposed to be giving blood.  Which brings me to another aspect of myself I discovered today.  I'm really bad about listening to my body when my intellect insists that I do something.  Like with giving blood, I really wanted to because it's not hard and it helps people, but obviously my body does not want to because of all that has happened.  So be it.

      My old blog stopped letting me post, it was sad.  And after reading everyone elses' blogs/livejournals for so long I began to want my own again.  So here it is.  Yay!  I have worked for three nights in a row.  Blah.  Kinkos people are mean and unhelpful, don't go there under any circumstances.  They are the only reason my zine isn't out yet.
