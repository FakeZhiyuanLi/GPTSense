      NAIROBI, Kenya -- Irene Wambui can't imagine why anyone would buy a baby stroller. She says she sees it as a cold cage filled with useless rattles,cup holders and mirrored headlights. Imagine children being stuffed into such a contraption and pushed around town like some kind of pet.  Yet here she is in the middle-class Westlands shopping district, trying to sell her store's newest merchandise, the four-wheeled plastic and metal tool of modern motherhood. But so far, strollers have been a flop in Nairobi, an affront to a time-honored tradition.  Across Africa, women can be seen carrying sleeping or sometimes giggly babies on their backs, swathed in cloth. The babies move to the sway of their mothers' hips, synchronized throughout the day, bending with them as they collect water or sweep the floor and rising again when the women stop to rest. They hang on as their mothers sell food in the market or pray at a church or mosque.  The introduction of strollers and baby carriages, both known here by the British word "pram", horrifies traditionalists, even someone such as Wambui, who sells them. The stroller is appearing in major cities around Africa, but so far has not been a hit.  "It's not so wonderful. In Africa, we just carry our children or let them roam. They can't sit like lumps," said Wambui, 24. "Besides our roads aren't even good enough for these devices. If everyone had a pram it would cause jam-ups in traffic. Then we would be bad to our children and bad to our roads."  Irene's boss and manager, Zara Esmail, was pacing back in forth in front of the strollers one recent day. She said the store had sold only one baby stroller in two months, and that was to a visiting U.N. worker from Britain, who complained later that she had been disappointed by the small selection.  "In general, I thought they would sell far better," Esmail said. Perhaps, she added, it's a question of directing more advertising toward middle-class, working moms. "We thought these modern ones would be a hit."  The stroller has sparked debate among African pediatricians who think the device -- first crafted as a labor-saving tool for the European middle class -- may damage the relationship between a mother and a child.  "The pram is the ultimate in pushing the baby away from you," said Frank Njenga, a child psychiatrist in Nairobi, Kenya's bustling capital. "The baby on the back is actually following the mother in warmth and comfort. The baby feels safer, and safer people are happier people."  In the United States and Europe, strollers have long been controversial. Recently, some doctors and child psychologists have blamed them for everything from pediatric obesity to low self-esteem later in life.  Jane Clark, professor of kinesiology at the University of Maryland, said there is concern that Americans are overusing strollers for older children, causing toddlers to be less physically active. A growing movement among child advocates promotes the idea of carrying babies more and getting them out of their strollers.  At the same time, Web sites and magazines in the United States and Europe dedicate a lot of space to the subject of choosing a style of stroller or carriage -- front-to-back or side-by-side, a jogger or a sleeper, with or without a lightweight titanium frame, pneumatic tires, rear suspension, mud flaps and/or battery-operated blinkers. Some European-made antique carriages are status symbols for celebrities such as Madonna and Celine Dion, who spent $2,600 on the classic Balmoral Pram, described by some Web reviewers as a tiny Humvee.  Africans consider the traditional method of toting their children the only true version of day care. When it's time for feeding, the food is right there as a mother shifts her child to the front of her body, nestling the infant to her breast. The baby stroller could change all of that. But many people here said they thought the devices would be just another instance of Africans adopting the worst habits of industrialization.  "There are customs from a hundred years ago that are not relevant today for Africans. Our challenge is to pick the good from the bad," said Carol Mandi, managing editor of EVE, an East African women's magazine. "But carrying on your back, well, that is just a wonderful custom that keeps the baby emotionally stable and lets the mother feel bonded. We can't stop being African women just because we are suddenly thrust into the modern world. What next? They will tell us to stop breast feeding in public? No way."  Some women in Africa at first apparently hoped the stroller could help reduce the physical exhaustion suffered by mothers, the backbone of Africa's labor force in both domestic duties and small-scale businesses.  But because the pram is not only socially unacceptable but expensive, merchants are finding they aren't selling. The average pram, though far cheaper than some car-like U.S. models, still hovers around $60, at least half a month's wages even in Africa's most successful urban economies.  At the baby store in Nairobi where Wambui works, dusty models sat untouched.  "We've never used a pram. They are a bit pricey," said Nellie Mwanzia, who was shopping nearby while her husband, Roy, carried their 20-month-old son, David. "Just carrying the baby is no bother. It's more personal."  Mary Mwanzia, 32, a mother and part-time government secretary, popped into the store to buy baby bottles. Esmail corralled her potential buyer over to the strollers. But Mwanzia, even with her modern job and her braided red hair extensions and bell-bottom jeans, found the baby buggies "oppressive."  Esmail suggested a test drive. Mwanzia was not having it.  "It's just not Kenyan," she said. "For the child, the love will not be there if the child is cooped up in such an antisocial device." She purchased her bottles and left.

      Yesterday on the news a fundamentalist told a reporter that church law states that life is to be considered sacred from conception to natural death, and that stem cell research is therefore immoral and ought not be allowed. Given that each of us is required to choose our own moral standard (whether we subscribe to the laws of a particular church organization, create a set of morals ourselves by which we choose to live, or disregard questions of morality altogether in our decision-making) and given that our nation subscribes to a principle of separation of church and state, church law, even if it's the law of the majority of churches in our nation, ought to have no bearing on the formation of secular law. Secular law in our land is rightfully formed based upon the majority of individual opinions, and individual opinion often takes into account the human factor, allowing space between church law and civil law in which the individual may make his or her choices according to his or her own moral feelings in a given moment and circumstance, which is likely to bring the majority in this and any moral question to a place in which civil law either does not deal with the issue or deals with it only in the sense of setting appropriate and commonly-accepted boundaries and guidelines around them (saying nothing about the legality or illegality of stem cell research, for instance, but seeing to it that appropriate sources are used, facilities are maintained properly, research is conducted ethically, etc.).  My question would be, if life is sacred from conception to natural death, is it morally appropriate to take any measure to avoid death when it arrives by nature? In other words, is it appropriate under that church law to, for instance, have a surgery or take a medication that mitigates symptoms that would otherwise eventually result in death? Would one not eventually pass the point at which natural death would otherwise have occurred, and does the life then become profane, or simply worthless? Perhaps this explains the reasoning by which babies who are being aborted anyway are to be treated as waste once their unnatural death has occurred rather than utilized to discover and treat illness in those who are still alive.  Curiously and with love Peace

      (From a friend): I was wondering if you had any interest in the Venus transit on June 8th and what (if any) significance you feel it may hold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Our world's been exploring a heavily masculine dynamic for some time now. The feminazi movement (not to be confused with it's underlying current, the feminist movement, which has taken longer to take root but also has a much more attractive flavor) brought an explosion of grrl power to the scene, and this transit indicates a readiness to embark on the process of true integration and balance (which I expect to reach a significant point of culmination around the time of the next transit on 6-6-2012; you're probably aware of the cycle, the two transits about eight years apart every 121 years or so) between the two. The masculine goes to battle. When male and female are balanced, it will be the feminine who chooses which battles are worthy, and who inspires the masculine to fight for a cause. It will also be she who says, "Enough. Let's heal the wounds." Venus represents that which is irresistibly, magnetically beautiful. Even in this transit, where her usual twinkling pink and green are seen as nothing more than a black spot on the face of the huge intensely-bright Sun, she moves with poised grace and confidence and all eyes are drawn to her, just because these dark periods are so rare for her. The emphases here are on communication, forward (evolutionary) motion, and home and family, with several challenging energetic aspects. The next transit indicates a move into a more comfortable, more productive energy along the same lines but with a more mature, fulfilled flavor, but I suspect the years between will be fairly turbulent. At the same time, those of us who've been practicing living consciously are likely to find it to be a lot of what we've all noticed lately, anticipatory energy requiring patience and a close attention to balance within and around ourselves. As women, it's important that we treat ourselves and those around us well, especially concentrating on the appropriate use of our feminine traits (including our wiles). What's appropriate to each of us is of course going to be dependent upon our personalities, life paths, and worlds. There's a particular emphasis here though on our relationships with men. We are to be our most beautiful selves, in order that they will be called to put their weight and strength behind our passions (so of course we're also defining our passions), as the Sun stands behind Venus in these transits shedding light and heat on her in these dark hours and making a backdrop against which those who seek her may see her as clearly as in her more usual shining moments. (Even then, the light she sends our way originates with the Sun; she just makes it more objectively beautiful than any other body in the sky, including the Sun.) What we'll see coming about around the time of the next transit is the fruitfulness for which Venus also stands. Her beauty creates an undeniable attraction. The proper use of her beauty brings about an inevitable bounty, although that bounty is rarely attributed to her beauty; the connection is subtle, and the fortune she represents comes about so naturally that it can easily go unnoticed, but we're called in this time not only to notice but to take time to be appreciative of it. (The beauty doesn't need acknowledging, it simply is, but the bounty requires some nurturing and cultivation.) (Of course, beauty never *minds* being acknowledged, either, and deserves a degree of appreciation just for being. In being, it creates an atmosphere in which joy and love are more easily attained.)       There's more of course, but these are the things that stand out to me today.

      I wonder what we'll do when we realize that for every pathogen we think we've conquered as many will arise as need be to fulfill the functions of those we've eliminated. Just beyond that and the awareness that disease is a form of natural population control is the realization that an uncontrolled population is it's own greatest danger, which means disease is good, in the sense of being purposeful and beneficial in the grand scheme. Most of us have no problem with these basic tenets until the disease results in death, especially the death of someone we know, especially someone we love.  Perhaps beyond the realization that disease is good we'll find that even death is good. Perhaps that will open the door to finding death in ease, not needing all the pain and trauma of disease or accident to allow ourselves to pass from this life to the next. And there will always be a next life. Life could not exist without death, but neither can death exist without life. If when we pass from these bodies there is nothing else then we must hope that we've lived each moment as we saw fit and death has not harmed or helped us any more than any other life experience; it has simply come to pass in the course of things. It seems to me more reasonable and there is more evidence to suggest that when we pass from these bodies, while we still hope to have lived as has seemed best to us, every aspect of us moves on to something new, a new type of life. The body is of course passed back to the Earth and used by her and her many denizens as fuel and building material, recycled over and over again until it's been broken down into it's most basic elements and taken up again into some plant, which will somewhere along the line either die and give those elements back to the Earth or be eaten by some animal which will then either incorporate them into it's own body until it dies and begins the process again or perhaps pass them along through an entity to which the animal gives birth, and that infant will in it's time either pass those elements along or die, and the cycle continues. The spirit and mind follow the same patterns, but our present science is not capable of quantifying that progression. For most Earthly entities this is not a concern - their brains and neural networks or whatever approximates those things in a given type of body (animal, plant, fungi, protozoan, what-have-you) are designed to experience life in a given manner, to collect whatever data is pertinent to doing so and utilize it to fulfill their purpose. The human being is unique in that it's brain is designed to question, seek reason(s), and look to the past and the future in an analytical way, so we wish to understand what happens to those other aspects of ourselves as intimately as we're coming to understand what happens on the physical level both in life and death. The spiritual and mental aspects of death, as of life, are found in and followed through faith and reason respectively. Faith, in accepting that there are those things which it's not our individual lot to know at a given time, and reason, in which we integrate that which we know with that which we can't know and follow them to their logical and illogical conclusions. Each of us is going to find faith in those things, voices, and ideas that prove themselves out to us over time, and each of us is going to subscribe to our own set of reasons according to our experience, knowledge, attitude, and mindset, just as each of us decides what parts of modern science we'll accept as comprehensive and accurate.  So getting back to the topic at hand, it's commonly accepted in many, perhaps even most circles, that stress is a significant factor in disease. As we work at reducing stress in our lives and our worlds, perhaps a closer look at death is called for. Perhaps much of the disease our elderly experience is connected to their awareness of death's approach, whether through worry and expectation or that feeling some have, that still small voice that tells them it's nearly time to go (explaining the disparity of length as well as variability of age of onset and pathology of diseases) and the surrounding uncertainty and general unease with the concept. The elderly of many cultures go out willingly, many still in seeming good health or at a level of health from which our culture would consider it a sin not to retrieve them, and simply wait for death's arrival when they feel it's appropriate for their community. Some consider it an honor to die in war. Few object morally to accidental death, although the cause of the accident may play a significant part in the opinions of others as to the honor or dishonor of an individual's passing in such a case. When a death is truly accidental it seems to me most reasonable to treat it as one of the things that belong in a realm in which morality is not taken into account. Not all issues are issues of good and evil, and of those which can be debated in that light there are few reasons for doing so, the most common purpose appearing to be that of dividing groups of people into opposing camps. The space between then often becomes a battleground. Using the issue of life and death as an example, we have those who consider all life to be sacred and believe that it must be preserved at all costs, and those who toss it away as carelessly as many discard a used tissue or an orange rind. In between are the majority, those who feel that some life is worth preserving and some is expendable. These folks are divided along lines of which lives are which, does life begin at conception, ought it to end when nature brings death? Whose nature, and what level of and segment of their nature? Everyone has an opinion on such things. How do we define whose judgement is correct? The majority? Which majority? God? Whose God? And what about the opinions of atheists, where does one count those if God is judge? Does self decide? What do we do when my opinions differ from yours? How much disease in those areas of the world where selfishness and selflessness are out of balance is the result of trying to see to our own needs and desires and those of our households while keeping in mind and heart the needs and desires of our neighbors and communities, our societies and our worlds? Where the incidence of disease is low we find nearly infinite configurations from places where the individual accepts that he or she is merely a cog in a machine to places where there is almost no direction. The former can become very large but individuals will invariably arise who desire to be seen and treated as such and when there are enough such individuals in any society they'll begin a swing back toward balance or catalyze the society's destruction (perhaps to rise again, perhaps not, and perhaps to return transformed). The latter are rarely if ever successful beyond a given size as the chaos within such a society rattles it apart from within in short order. They may splinter into more small groups, simply disintegrate, or be absorbed into a larger, more directed society. In between are many forms of governance available to the modern human as is seen in the many successful societies around the world, and even in our global community, but the point is that no one approach is ever going to be the right one for everyone.  The same is true with death. For some it's appropriate to extend life at all costs, to preserve anything that may be construed as life in any way. For others it's appropriate to completely disregard the concept of life entirely, or to see it as at worst a hindrance and at best a nuisance. The majority, again, will fall somewhere in the middle, see some forms and degrees of life as worthy, even sacred, and others as moot or even pesky. Perhaps a part of the cure for disease is creating a world in which there's room for all of us, one way or another. Perhaps death is not the enemy. Perhaps there is no inherent enemy and maybe there's no reason that every conflict has to be or become a war. Is it really getting us anywhere, this chronic state of illness, or might we be more productive, happier, more contented and fulfilled, and at the same time freer, more confident, inventive and uninhibited, kinder and more well-mannered. This is not to say the rude would not be with us, and the crass and unfriendly, but when we respond to rudeness with kindness we, at least, do not create more of the same ill feeling the other person has brought us, and at best may prompt that individual to find something kinder and gentler within and toward him- or herself. Either fosters both the personal and greater good. A third option, to respond with more rudeness or another ill-tempered action, whether due to anger or frustration or whatever negative emotions arise within us as a result of the other person's actions, serves largely to create ill feeling within ourselves (which, left unaddressed may result in chronic disease) and often creates a ripple effect in our wider world, just as does acting through positive emotions but in a more chaotic, even destructive way. In the context of this posting, relating disease to death, perhaps it's not the proximity of death that creates illness around it for us, but acting through our negative emotions toward it, fear, anger, sadness and the rest. Of course, it's not the only thing that prompts us to negative action, thus it wouldn't be the only issue around which disease would be born in the body, and sometimes disease strikes those who seem least to deserve it and approach death faithfully and fearlessly. Perhaps those entities choose to be examples to us of the aplomb with which one is able to approach the end of life when life is lived in the way we feel is best within a community that sees our worth. Perhaps the truest way to honor them is to seek the message in their lives  and  their deaths, to feel them near and in ourselves and our friends and loved ones and ponder what it means if it's true they're still with us. What do we want to leave when it's our time to pass, angst and grief, joy and loving memories, some reasonable, human combination of the two, perhaps? If our energy does not go on, fine, at least we've surrounded ourselves with the best in each moment we have. If it does, what kind will it be?  Much love Peace

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-\ I'm  sorry to hear he's passed. But I have to say that he illustrates something  that's been kind of eating at me for a couple years now, the language of war  that permeates our culture. He doesn't look like a child who was wasting his  time fighting a disease, but like one who was living his life with a disease.  I'm sure he hoped a cure&nbsp;or at least supportive, life-extending therapies  would be discovered in time to help him and his mom and other folks with the  same condition, but he doesn't look and never came across as though&nbsp;he  spent a lot of time or energy *fighting* it. I guess it bugs me a little to hear  it put that way all the time (everything's a war or battle these days). Mattie  had such a sweet, gentle, loving spirit, it feels almost like it dishonors him  to think of him feeling ill toward his disease, especially when it was part of  what allowed him to reach so many. We've got the war on drugs, the war on terror  (*war* on a state of emotion :-|), wars on cancers and other diseases of all  kinds, we battle our weight, signs of aging, for and against various causes, we  never go gently or gracefully anymore as it's apparently ignoble to ever 'go  down' without a fight. (Funnily enough, since that's *exactly* what Jesus chose  to do that was *so* noble, to take his punishment with dignity and without  complaint or struggle, and it's most often those who follow him {not those who  walk with him as a friend and companion, but those who profess to believe in him  as savior} who use this language and take these fighting attitudes.) (Not *only*  Christians, but they're on the forefront of many, even most battles one way or  another.) How does one fight a disease anyway? Seems like a battle-oriented  mindset will only serve to perpetuate ill feelings which would only exacerbate  the general disease. I dunno. It's kind of nit-picky I know, but y'all know how  I feel about words, how they define our worlds and are one of the first steps in  manifestation.&nbsp;Seems like describing everything in terms of war would bring  about... well, pretty much what we've got in the world -&nbsp;division, strife,  contention and a general state of&nbsp;embattlement. It's part of what makes it  so hard for some to see what Bush is doing and what our military is doing  (which, by the way, is no surprise to anyone who's been around it for any length  of time) as the ugly, selfish behaviors they are, is that we've glorified the  ideal of battle for so long now that all they have to do is make the 'other  side' seem sufficiently evil and it becomes obvious that what we're doing is  right. Folks around here are saying now that, "... we oughta just nuke [the  Iraqis]." No regard there for the fact that the majority of people who'd die  would be civilians trying to live ordinary, everyday lives just like the  majority of people here, they're women, children, old folks, babies, men who  have nothing to do with any military effort except where they've become so  desperate that they feel they must do *something* and just despondent enough to  strap on a bomb and hope their action helps to wake us up to what we're doing.  It's sick. But these are the same people who say they'd kill other people for  minor offenses, never considering what a really strong statement that is. I  mean, we rejoice at the idea of killing *germs*, which is not only stupid since  germs are a necessary part of our world and nothing to be afraid of in  moderation but such an asinine thing to get puffed up about considering that  germs are tiny, essentially defenseless creatures. It's like people thinking  they're all that when they throw a rock at a cat and hit it or when they're mean  enough to a dog to make it the meanest one at the cage matches. (Dog fighting  rings are broken up here with some regularity, and that's a sick, sick thing.)  What kind of people take pride in those acts? The same kind of people who think  they're cool when they walk into a town with a machine gun and open fire,  ripping apart everything in sight including any available human being,  defenseless or not, just because they live in&nbsp;a country that we, in our  American pride and supposed&nbsp;moral and intellectual superiority, have  decided is inherently evil. Of course, it seems to be going unnoticed that  germs, tiny and essentially defenseless as they appear to be, are doing a fine  job of not only surviving but becoming stronger and more effective. If we choose  to continue on such a path we'll find, I think, that the same is true of the  people we consider so inconsequential that their lives don't matter. Or,  perhaps, we'll actually manage to eradicate all the pesky nations and germs we  hate so much, and then we'll be left with just ourselves to fight. I don't  believe for one second that those who commit and perpetuate these acts will be  satisfied until every opposing view is eradicated, but I do believe that diverse  perspectives are stronger than singular visions so I'm convinced that at some  point we who choose to seek harmony rather than unity will be the ones left  standing. But I'm sorry to hear Mattie's passed. Thanks for the update,  Julie.      &nbsp;    Much love     Peace        ----- Original Message -----       Sent:     Wednesday, June 23, 2004 4:10 PM      Subject:  [moonpyre] Mattie Stepanek    :-(                  Mattie    Stepanek, Poet and Advocate, Dies at 13           By STEPHEN    MANNING, AP            &nbsp;          ANNAPOLIS,    Md. (June 22) - Mattie Stepanek, the child poet whose inspirational verse made    him a best-selling writer and a prominent advocate for muscular dystrophy,    died Tuesday from complications of the disease. He was    13.            &nbsp;          Mattie died    at Children's  National   Medical   Center  in   Washington  , the hospital    said.            &nbsp;          "Mattie was    something special, something very special," Muscular Dystrophy Association    National Chairman Jerry Lewis said in a statement. "His example made people    want to reach for the best within themselves. It was easy to forget how sick    he was because his megawatt personality just made you want to    smile.            &nbsp;          Mattie had    dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, a genetic disease that impaired almost    all of his body's major functions, such as heart rate, breathing, blood    pressure and digestion, and caused muscle    weakness.            &nbsp;&nbsp;             His mother,    Jeni, 44, has the adult-onset form of the disease, and his three older    siblings died of it in early childhood.            &nbsp;          Mattie began    writing poetry at age 3 to cope with the death of a brother. In 2001, a small      Virginia      publisher issued a slim volume of his poems, called "Heartsongs." Within    weeks, the book reached the top of The New York Times best-seller list, the    MDA said.            &nbsp;          He wrote    four other books: "Journey Through Heartsongs," "Hope Through Heartsongs,"    "Celebrate Through Heartsongs" and "Loving Through    Heartsongs."            &nbsp;          Mattie's    poems brought him admirers including Oprah Winfrey and former President Carter    and made him one of the best-selling poets in recent    years.            &nbsp;          06/22/04    18:33 EDT             &nbsp;       http://www.oprah.com/spiritself/insp/psp/ss_insp_psp_mattie_tribute.jhtml

                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great query, Rae. I would run, not  walk, back to my life, let the holographic mom do all the 'chore-y' stuff for a  day, get&nbsp;her holographic hubby to go to work for Dude, gather all our  nearest and dearest and those who fill their days with love and joy&nbsp;(having  them/you replaced with holograms so you too could be worry-free), and spend the  day having a party of the sometimes loud-and-raucous, sometimes  quiet-and-intimate variety, one in which everyone could find something they  enjoyed to do at any given time as well as having plenty of time and space to do  nothing if you so desired. How 'bout you (all)?      &nbsp;    Love, and more soonly     Peace        ----- Original Message -----       Sent:  Friday, June 25, 2004 3:12 PM      Subject:  [moonpyre] Imagine this           it's time to remove    all the labels - mother, daughter, carer, sister, friend, therapist,    wife........  The wish faery pays you a visit. Your children are taken    care of for the day - even the babies have another holographic 'you' which    means you don't have to give them a second thought. You have no    responsibilities to your partner, home, studies, family, friends, land or    animals - everything is taken care of. Money is not an issue, neither is    travelling - you just close your eyes and you are there.  You have 24    hours to be totally *you*. What do you do in those 24 hours?  Rae    xx

       ----- Original Message -----   From:  Jenna   Subject:  [moonpyre] The Value of Grief     The Value of Grief   I remove the barriers to my sadness.&nbsp; And as I allow this grief to flood my being, it wraps around me and holds me tenderly.&nbsp; Though I've tried to avoid this sadness through distractions or anger, I now find this gentle sorrow to be a surprising relief.   I express my grief.&nbsp; And as I do, tears wash the poisons from my heart.&nbsp; They soften and calm me like a day of misting rain cools and renews the earth.&nbsp; This sorrow heals, for this is the value of grief: When I allow my sadness to be real, I go through it into the radiance of my future.&nbsp; Slowly, silently, I heal.    &nbsp;   (from,  'Beginning Again: Beyond the End of Love: Meditations for Starting Over' by Will Limon )

                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've decided to vote for Kerry.  Even if he only means a fraction of what he says (and we have no reason to  believe that he doesn't stand behind every word), he may not be just the lesser  of two evils but actually a force for positive change. We're impressed not only  by what he says but by what he chooses not to say. He actually brings forth a  sense of hope. Yay!      &nbsp;    Love     Peace
