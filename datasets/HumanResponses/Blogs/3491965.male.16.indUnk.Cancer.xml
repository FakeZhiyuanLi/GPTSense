      The Drugstore Rodeo is now open for business.  I can't say that I have any pre-meditated plans for this site, but I believe I'll just take everything in stride and see what kind of direction it may take.  Well maybe I lied, I do have the intention of grounding this site around a musical basis.  Hopefully this will be fun.  Felix Carmichael (Julian Bulaon)

      Ok folks, Felix Carmichael is finally making his journalistic debut on Alex Mayer's new site, which has been designed to provide reviews on contemporary tunes, flicks and books.  As you can see this is the music section, which I will oversee like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt oversaw his legions of slaves.  There will be times when you and I will celebrate at the magnificence of your favorite artist's newest release, and there will be times when I will defecate upon the reputation of that very same artist.  However I swear to you the reader that I will provide nothing but the most honest criticism.  If the question "Why does this guy think his opinion is better than everyone else's?" ever pops into your head, I will ask you to get the hell off my site and throw your money around in a Best Buy until you are convinced that there is no way you will find quality music without consulting someone else's opinion.  I'm not asking you to do what I say, rather I'm asking you to read about your music and to be informed about it. Get involved!    Felix Carmichael

         Five Iron Frenzy has, after 8 years, 6 full-length albums, one EP, countless 7" vinyls and appearances on various compilations, decided to call it quits.  In their farewell two-disc set, Five Iron combines an all-new full-length album ("The End is Near" - Disc 1) and a complete live recording of their final concert ("The End is Here" - Disc 2).  Having attained a huge cult following among America's youth, I don't think I can fully describe the impact Five Iron has had over the years.  I'll let this review speak for me:   By Aleem Hossain   "It’s impossible to do the album justice in a short review as it is quintessential of everything FIF has stood for. Reese Roper has long-established himself as one of the most creative and idiomatic singers and songwriters in the industry and 'The End...' showcases him at his best. There’s a vitriolic attack on capitalism ("American Kryptonite"); a ruthless onslaught on media spin ("Anchors Away") and savage swipes at the music industry ("So Far, So Bad"). The light-hearted "Wizard Needs Food, Badly" is a track for all those men who just want to play with big boys' toys. The aptly named, "That’s How The Story Ends" serves to bring a sense of closure with references to older songs such as "Where Is Micah?", "The Untimely Death Of Brad" and "These Are Not My Pants," as well as a farewell to favourite characters such as Combat Chuck, Kitty Doggy and the blue comb. "It Was Beautiful" is a sincere song of praise and thanks to God as the band remember the past eight years together. Musically, the band combines elements of rock, punk, ska and metal, whilst "See The Flames Being To Crawl" features the rasta vocal and groove that the band experimented with on 'All The Hype That Money Can Buy.' By far the brightest jewel on the album is the painfully honest closing track "On Distant Shores" which recognises the band’s struggles and seems to encompass everything that FIF writes about. The song borrows its closing lines from, what is undeniably one of FIF’s most powerful songs, "Every New Day". Clearly, a lot of thought and detail has been put into this project as it combines the best musical elements of previous releases with challenging, poignant and, in typical Five Iron style, humorous lyrics.   You could almost buy the record, which comes in a jewel case and cardboard sleeve, for Douglas Ten Napel's [album] artwork alone. Rumours are bound to be rife as Ten Napel's seemingly dead-and-buried Five Iron Bunny Monster nudges its box open [on the final page]. Suggestion, perhaps, that this is not FIF's final chapter, though I prefer to think that this is just an ironic prod at the rumours which seem to have been an inherent part of FIF's career. Only time will tell, I guess, but the band will leave a huge hole in Christian music as a band who continually sounded so fresh and addressed issues that most Christian bands pretend are not there. It is that ability to balance taboo issues, witty cynicism with a sublime sense of humour that have made Five Iron one of the most refreshing, challenging, unique and loved bands for the best part of a decade. I'm sure, even in years to come, their albums will remain as relevant as ever."     Yeah.   Grade: A-

         I'm trying a new format for music reviews, so bear with me...   Summary:  With it's third full-length album, rock outfit Pillar solidifies it's place in the alternative rock genre.  With a more cultivated, refined sound, Pillar's maturity since it's debut album  Above  shows in both the musical and lyrical aspects of their new record.   Pluses:  As previously stated, Pillar brings a much more refined and mature sound to the new album, and the lyrics show growth as well (for example, on "Rewind"). The musical quality is for the most part impressive, and this album can easily be counted as one of the top releases in the alternative genre this year.   Minuses:  A few tracks fall short: "Dirty Little Secret" and "Staring Back" are songs that cause me to usually hit the "skip" button on my CD player. "Underneath It All" and "One Thing" don't stand out as anything special, and the punk rock feel of "Holding On" - while a decent song - seems out of place on the album.   Standout Tracks:  - "Hypnotized," "Bring Me Down," "Let it Out," "Rewind," "Frontline," and "Aftershock."   Grade: B

         Like R&B but sick of the shallow, materialistic lyrics found in most R&B albums? Look no further than Out of Eden.  The veteran R&B female trio delivers yet again with their 5th full-length album, and after a decade in the music business, they've perfected their sound.  Smooth, harmonic vocals blended with heavy beats and catchy rhythms are OOE's trademark, and they offer up a fresh serving with  Love, Peace, and Happiness .  The album opens with the upbeat intro track "Make Way." The rapid-fire vocals accompany a sort of explanation of OOE's mission and overall message.  The next few songs, "Just the Way," and the title track, are positive, lighthearted diddys that pretty much exemplify the tone and message of the album (just take a look at the title).  "Soldiers," the heavy, bass-laden club anthem, is catchy and changes the tone, but the real standout is the next track, "I Know." Leaving the fluff and and happy tone of the beginning tracks, it's written in the form of 2 conversations with inner-city teens - a 14-year old prostitute and a high-school gang member.  First the lyrics go through a series of lines that begin "I wish-," then moving into the chorus, each line beginning with "I know-." A touching and heartfelt plea to today's urban youth, it's one of the best songs on the album.  "It's You" returns to the positive and light tone of the majority of the album, but the next two tracks - "Shoulda' Listened" and "Could've Been Me" - are more serious.  "Shoulda' Listened" details a prodigal-daughter type story with a young woman writing a letter about how she should have listened to the advice of her mother and pastor, but she didn't and not she's in a bad situation.  Hope still prevails in the end, however, as the woman says:    "But I've seen the light somehow / And I vow to listen now But you don't have to tell me twice / I'm gonna listen now."   "Could've Been Me" is a musically rich song, blending heavy beats with acoustic guitar and strings.  OOE gives thanks for their great lives, looking at more unfortunate people and saying "it could've been me," as well as encourageing listeners to remember this fact and lend a hand to those people.  "Drama Free" is a catchy, upbeat track that complains about a gossipy, shallow friend who lives life like it's a daytime drama.  "Secret" tells people of faith to live in such a way that other people will notice something different about them and ask them what their "secret" is.  The album closes on the slower, deeper "Sincerely," with OOE giving a touching, heartfelt thanks to their savior for saving them even though they're unworthy.    Grade=B-
