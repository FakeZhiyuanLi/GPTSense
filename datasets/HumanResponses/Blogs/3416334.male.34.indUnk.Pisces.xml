      The pressure of writing this particular post is immense. I mean, this the first and, more than likely, the last time I even logon to this blog let alone publish anything. This work will define my blogging future. How will the masses who are certain to flock to this anonymous web page receive what I have to say? I am reminded that this is an exercise I must endure to save my friends and co-workers from my inflated sense of self importance and, that no one is actually reading this anyway.  I awoke this morning to the usual banter of a local talk radio show. You know the type. Some wannabe pundit mines the local paper a couple of minutes before going on the air and picks out a few topics which might actually generate controversy and interest, and then shares an uninformed, narrow-minded opinion thereby eliciting a response from a like-minded audience. And yes, I know that includes me.   Sometimes I laugh at the stupidity, sometimes I am angered by it, and sometimes I actually agree with it. This morning, however, I had to fight my inner demons to avoid making that all too frequent “first time caller” mistake of actually picking up the phone and dialing the number to call and voice my opinion.   The really amazing thing about my reaction is that I have no personal interest in the topic, “Should gay couples be allowed to marry?”. I am not married and I am not gay. I am not aware that any of my friends or relatives is gay. In short, I have no horse in that race but yet here I am some 13 hours later still rambling on about it.  Should any two law abiding adults who are in love with each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together be denied the legal rights and responsibilities that are bestowed upon married couples? Of course not. Any other answer is indefensible. Let me see if I can tackle a few of the popular conservative objections being raised on the right.  The most common reason against gay marriage that I hear is that it will diminish family values in some way. This argument is stupid on so many levels it is difficult to respond. How does anything I do affect your family values? Can someone please explain to me how the marriage of Adam and Steve will somehow diminish the bond of Adam and Eve? Please don’t try and confuse this issue by citing some study about how children need a mom and a dad. That is a separate matter and in case you were unaware, the “should gays be allowed to raise children” battle was waged years ago and guess what, gay people can be parents too.  Next, I often hear an argument that goes something like “Marriage is an institution that has been around for thousands of years and we ought not to tinker with the definition of it.” While that may be a fact it doesn’t necessarily make an argument. I do not spend much time trying to judge the actions or standards of prior generations. I can only assume they did the best they could with what they knew and what they had to work with. Just because something has been unchanged for thousands of years doesn’t negate the possibility that there is a better way. History is replete with examples of bad institutions which needed change (slavery comes to mind). Our society is changing and our laws must keep up. Homosexuals make up a significant and growing portion of our society. Whether the actual number is 1% or 10% we are talking about a large portion of our people who need and deserve the legal rights our society gives to married couples.  Lately I’ve heard a lot of the “we can’t allow gay marriages because it will create a legal quagmire” argument. There is some truth in this belief. The Constitution requires states to honor the laws of other states, meaning that a marriage legal in one state probably must be recognized by others. This will undoubtedly lead to a horrific glut of litigation in family courts and possibly criminal courts as well. But should we deny basic rights to individuals because our laws are backwards or should we pass progressive laws to protect the rights of these individuals?  The truth about this entire deliberation is that it is not about gay marriage. This is a morality attack on gays. This is about a portion of our population disapproving of a particular lifestyle. This is a war that was fought decades ago and some of my fellow citizens sadly cannot accept their defeat. One reason I know that I am right is that those who publicly oppose gay marriage rarely have the intellectual honesty or the courage to come right out and say it. Why not just say that homosexuality is an aberration to your particular god and that you believe homosexuality is a sin? The reason you don’t is because you know that a religious argument has little merit in a secular nation and can only serve to alienate those with different religious beliefs.  Some have suggested that “civil unions” (a legal status that isn’t marriage but grants the legal rights and responsibility of marriage) might be the answer. Didn’t we try separate but equal already? Let’s give these people the full acceptance and recognition our diverse society allows. Life is just too short to spend it limiting the rights of others.  The real silliness about this debate is the timing of the recent public outcry. Unfortunately for those who think this cultural battle is just getting started, this race is over. The momentum behind the acceptance of gay marriage is unstoppable. More and more cities and states will allow these unions and because of the full faith and credit provisions of the Constitution others will be forced to accept it. Trying to undo recent events would be like trying to re-institute slavery or taking the right to vote away from women. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle and you can’t unring this bell.

      Welcome to the Pickled Pig. I am the Pickled Pig and I have an opinion about everything. The problem I face is that no one, not even me, likes to hear my opinions all of the time. It is not because my opinions are wrong or lack insight mind you, but just that it is inappropriate to outwardly opine in much of my real life. Therefore I find myself setting up this page and at the very least, maybe I can just bore you instead of someone I actually care about. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and maybe one day, it will actually be worth viewing.
