      OK my mom is the queen of bitches. It's 4:00 AM and shes making me do a buncha fucking homework and chores before I go to bed. I have a huge ass Bio test I havent studied for so I am screwed. But its not my fault its that bitch's.  She thinks shes helping me out by keeping track of all my shit and staying on my case but she is really making my life worse and making me resent her even more. And then once my grades do go up she will take all the credit and be like "Arent you glad I helped you?" And I say "Hey, guess what! NO! FUCK OFF!"  Oh yeah and here is something a good friend wrote in her diary I thought I'd share:  why do things have to get so complicated as you grow up? why do people have to grow up anyways? and more importantly, how does one draw a line between child and adult? is it really about age or maturity or life experience? im 14 years old and ive experienced the effects of growing up with an alcoholic father and a mentally ill mother. ive experienced love, heartbreak, a first kiss, and a life-threatening situation. sometimes im wise and deep and understanding, and other times i have the mental capacity and maturity level of a six-year-old. how does all that add up? i know im still young, but i feel like my life is passing by too quickly. the past year has gone by so fast. i feel rushed and pressured and burdened with all kinds of responsibilities im not ready for. what ever happened to the simplicity of hopscotch and bubble-blowing? i can hardly remember those days...im so caught up in focusing on here and now that my entire past is just a hazy blur of laughter and tears. and the same is true for any teenager, im sure. we all spend so much time pondering how-come's what-if's and the meaning of life and a million other things that no amount of pondering will ever reveal the answers to. our lives tick away more quickly than we realize while we sit around pondering life instead of living it. but in the end it all seems a waste of time anyways. the older you get, the more weight is put on your shoulders. you have to start figuring things out for yourself. its a long winding road of trial-and-error, filled with mistakes and bad luck and wrong choices. first its the aching hearts and the broken friendships and making the grades. then, before you know it youre being shoved out the door by the hand that once cradled you when you cried, and into the real world where you throw bills and taxes and paperwork into the mix. and you work hard and marry young and have children and grow old and get sick and spend the last three years of your life lying in a nursing home bed, wishing it had all just ended after your hopscotch and bubble-blowing days were over. but instead you were too busy trying to teach and to learn and to make a difference. but it matters not what you had to offer the world or what kind of contributions your bank account allowed you to make, because no one is invincible, and we'll all end up rotting under 6 feet of dirt anyways.

      This is me. Hello I am here to type stuff that angers me or amuses me or stuff that I just feel like writing so enjoy or whatever.  Well I havent been online lately because the female parental unit decided that I had a bad attitude and that my grades sucked. Ok for my sake only half of that is true. My attitude sucks sometimes but thats only because shes a fucking bitch and annoys the fuck out of me so I decided to do it right back but most of the time I am out of the way. And one freaking D is not bad grades in my book. Me mum and dad think I am like some sort of genius child so they expect all A's and B's from me. They were like you shouldnt be in this kind of situation or whatever. I'm like fuck you nigga I aint not no smart ass mother fucker who does all his work an understands all this shit and is some teachers pet mother fucker. I'm a lazy ass child who shows spurts of brilliance and amuses myself with the most lame shit. I know how smart I am and I am performing under my ability but these mother fuckers expect way way way too much out of Brian.  Which brings me to my next point, I'm getting it all out, my dumb ass sisters are ratting my ass out everytime I sneak online or what have you and they go tell mammy and then I get to hear her annoying ass voice. God it pisses me off just the way she fucking talks she fucking yells everything. Then she misinterprets every freaking thing I say or every paper she reads and shit. She goes through all these papers from like 3 months ago and will be like did you turn this in where is it let me see it, shes stupid as fuck it really is pissing me off now.  I guess thats all for now I'll post if I get anything else in the near future.

      I saw 28 Days Later....again. It's probably my favorite movie or at least top 3. It makes me mad because people that see it are all dissappointed and say it sucked because it wasn't scary. I didn't see it that way. The people that see that movie in that way simply do not have the mindset or intelligence to comprehend the severity, brilliance, and everything about that movie. It just makes me mad. Real mad. I hate the way a lot of people go see movies that have nothing to them they see movies that dont make you   do   anything. They dont go to movies that make you think or comprehend or interpret anything. They have no culture or intellegence they are just mindless stuck up mother fuckers who just get drunk and/or high and go to a movie, and thats the only way they have fun. It pisses me off.  On a more cheerful note I just saw a Loraine skit from MADTV. They are hilarious!!! If anyone shares this opinion word to yo mamma.

      UK won today I am filled with joy (sarcasm).  We honestly suck this year.  I like the way we play for some reason except sometimes it gets really boring the Cats just seem to make games boring whenever they play. I like the fundamental game they play but they bore it down a lot. This team is probably the worst shooting team we have had in years. It dissappoints me so, but it is getting better.  On another note, I want a job. I need moola and a car...I cant wait to drive I will never be home like ever. Watch the mammy take my keys away for stupid reasons like not doing the garbage and then my sister will get away with a speeding ticket (which already happened). What a whore.

      Bad day today very bad day.  I was sick and throwing up all day and then I get this email from my soccer manager about how I missed practice. He said there was no notification even though my sister tried their house but it was busy and then he asked on the email if he wanted me to remove my name from the roster. I was like bastard! I am serioously contemplating quitting though because it isnt any fun anymore. I might even switch clubs behind they back if someone else would take me. It could also be our Interim Coach but I think it's the whole thing. Somebody help me please.

      I just thought of the thing I hate more than anything.  I hate when people say RANDOM.  It is the most overused word in any Ballard person's vocabualry.  It is so fucking annoying.  People will go "That was random" or "you're random" I really don't give a flying fuck who or wut is random and the fact that you people use that word so much to represent such a stupid comment pisses me off to the fucking max. You should all die.  THose who agree with this statement please supplement the phrase "out of the blue" or the word spontaneous for the bad word.

      Let's see if I can remmber everything I wanted to say.  Ok first thing that comes to mind is how much I hate loud people when I'm not loud.  It's hypocritical I know but I just want to kill those people.  Like in my Business Class theres this group of people who just sit there and yell and talk and they have all these meaningless conversations about who they "go wit" and all they do is just yell across the room and don't even make complete sentences.  Stupid dumbfucks. they piss me off so unbelievably much it is uncomprehendable.  There's this new gay one and he is so fucking homosexual it amkes me mad, not that I'm a homophobe but his voice just annoys the fuck out of me.  He has this lisp and he thinks he's the shit so I want to kill him. I could go more in depth on my BM class but I don't feel like it.

      I hate trends so fucking much. I am a trend hater. I don't know whether I just hate the trend itself or the people or just everything, who knows.  So many little things I see that are starting makes me despise some people. Maybe sometime when I'm not lazy I'll go in depth with specific trends.

      The one thing I want to do more than anything in my lifetime would be to play soccer on the moon. I want to go to the moon, I think it is honestly surreal. Only like 5 people have ever been there in the history of the universe. It'd be fun to go around walking on air and then kick a soccer ball 200 yards, which is impossible on Earth. I don't know if I have it in me to train and study hard enough to do that though.

      School is driving me crazy right now. I have gotten really lazy in English and Math and it's all Ms. Welker's fault.  She is our longterm sub who has been here or will have been here for twice as long as she said.  Anyways she's this old wrinkley altzheimers lady who is trying to be young just like all the old ones these days. All she does is sit there and yell at people make us do busy work and then grades said work really strictly. She loses everyones papers.  She is so lost allt he time it's getting really old. Like her.  Ask anyone in Big Brinley's class. GOD DAMNIT I HATE HER.  Spring Break is almost here and I'm going to the beach! I can't wait to get away fo real. Hopefully I can bring a friend though, otherwise it won't be as cool.

      Big pet peeve. I know everyone has seen that stupid asian guy William Hong on American Idol, the guy who sucked at sining she bangs it was "funny"  But of course the press and music people had to jump on it. So instead of him fading into bolivian(sp) they over do it and give him a record contract, a FUCKING record contract, and all this press. All the people think it's some feel good story because he "had no regrets" and he "tried his best".  Well woo fucking who, you are a busted num shit who has some crooked ass teeth with fuzz growing out of them and can't even sing the right lyrics to a song. He is seriously dumb, have you ever heard him talk? God it makes me soo mad the way America rewards people that are sucky because they think it's soem sort of rebel thing to do. And now being a rebel is all of a sudden some sort of trend now. It's so god damn annoying and any of you who think this guy is still funny or anything go jump off a cliff right the fuck now. You should die.

      Why is it all of a sudden cool to be black? I mean honestly, I'm not racist but still all of a sudden everyone and everything cool is "ghetto" and gangsta". Seriously like that stupid Sprite doll thing, he is fucking annoying as fuck. And then there is all the wigger gear, FUBU, ECKO etc. why do white people wear that shit, FUBU means for us by us, and you know who makes it? So stop now. Another thing that contributes to this is Rap. Rap is very misunderstood. MTV stands for Music Television right, its a hipocracy because rap is NOT music in any form of the word. All it is is people yelling about their stupid beefs with other gangs rappers etc. FUCK THAT I really odnt think their little problesm are very relevant in the world and they should all just die. Fifty Cent is the leading one of these stupid assholes. Rap is degrading the quality of vocabulary in the world. Most black people are lazy so they come up with abbreviations for certain words and phrases, there fore they dont even talk in complete sentences. This carries over to rap music which a lot of people listen to which makes white people talk like that, with the exception of those who are individuals and actaually choose to listen to MUSIC and not follow the crowd. Evolution enters the picture and soon enough we will all be talking like that unless something is done. It just makes me mad that people think it is cool to be gangster, I hope they all die so the world is not ruined.

      Wellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll, I just got back from my big anti climax of a Spring Break. I was bored out of my mind, I had nothing to do at all. All my sister, her firend, and my mom did was go to the god damn pool and "lay out". What a waste. It sucked. I thunked about a lot of shit while I was gone and in the couple of hours since I've been back and caught up on some stuff. Dont get me wrong the vacation was better than being in Louisville and school.  It really sucks that school exists, next year will hopefully be my last at the hell hole aka Ballard. I'm hoping to transfer to Manual although my grades really suck so I might be stuck at the dungeon for the rest of my career. Chelsea wants to get out real bad nad her dad is going to talk to the principal and she wrote them a letter we shall see how it works out. But she wants to go to Waggener also which sucks because shes leaving away.   Soccer will start up on Tuesday and I will not be prepared. I was a fat ass on the break. I ate and drank and ate and ate and drank. On the last day I ate a whole 16 inch pizza by myslef. Thank You.  My sister called Pink Floyd boring I was pissed. She can fuck off, we got in an EPIC fight in the condo. But she acted like it was torture to listen to Floyd. And she forced me to endure My Morning Jacket. I like them for like 2 songs but the lead singers voie gets annoying and all the music sounds the same. Same wiht John Mayer and The Strokes, but lets not get started.

      We had to write this stupid open response in Business Marketing the other day. It was about databases and how people use them in the workplace. It asked us to name 4 functions and give an example. So I did and I ended up with like 6 sentences. I did what it told me to do, there is no use for SRE in that thing because it doesnt apply to the directions. Yet our teacher makes us fill out one of the charts. When I turned in my paper she goes you didnt tell me much and I was like I did what it told me. On the fucking pointless ass CATS test that probably woulda gotten a 4 but im gonna get 10 points out of 40 (a 1) because she doesnt know what the fuck she is doing.  Although everyone else in my class manged to write paragraphs, it still doesnt matter I follwed the fucking directions. SO BLAM MOTHER FUCKER!  That whole story wasnt really that big of a deal but I thought i would rant about it anyways and make it seem like it was.

      I used to think my life was bad. I mean I'm not satisfied with my life in any means but then again who is? I was reading this girls diary online and it was fucking depressing.  I mean people make fun of her and she really is cool. But that's the way my fucking school works, the rich preppy ones rule the world or rather they rule the ones that let them rule them, if that makes any sense lol. And they go and judge everyone else and want you to try so hard to impress them or else you're shunned upon. I really havent met anybody at Ballard, with obvious exceptions of some, that has really been down to earth and not all I'm better than you. They can all fuck off seriously. FUCK OFF all of you bastards. Sometimes I walk through the halls thinking to myself if I want to kill the people that pass me. Usually I do. A lot of them are black people yelling stupid meaningless jibberish in their little ebonics but a lot of them I know and hate and others are just asses I hate.

      I was watchin the McDonalds All-America Slamfest or something. And it was like a slam dunk contest and three point contest and some other thing. But it was really funny because all the commentators were like crtiquing the slam dunk contest and analyzing it. I was like comeon get a life. They were like their strategy should be to "dunk and advance" I was like they arent trying to win the god damn thing theyre just trying to have fun so shut up. They were like he needs to nail this to win and all this shit, he shouldnt be trying something hes never done before, he shouldnt just run up and jup and then decide, blah blah blah what low life losers.

      I haven't had my Limp Bizkit rant yet. OK Limp Bizkit fucking is the worst god damn band ever. They suck so much ass. They start out being some sort of wigger mix of rap and rock and then they go into some shit with that guy from Staind or whoever all soft and sad and mellow back to some other genre of music.THEN! THEN! They go and cover one of the best songs The Who ever wrote, sang, and performed. And not just that they did it but they made it sound like absolute horse SHIT. So it adds another little personality to the ever morphing band of sucky ass people. You see the video and they want you to be all sad or whatever, yea they have a lot wrong in their lives boo fucking hoo. You jacked a really good song, made it sound like fucking rubbish, and WORST of all you make everyone who had never heard the song before like it. To you Limp Bizkit I say  FUCK OFF  and to those who enjoy their version of that song I say you don't now what music is, and finally to those who have heard both and like Bizkits version better I hope you suffer the most fucking, violent, humiliating, public, vain, torturing, and painful death right now.

      One thing I really hate is when people are all like "I'm have A.D.D I have to or I have ADHD because blah blah blah" then they start laughing like it's funny. It's like theyre fucking bragging or something like OMG its so cool to have A.D.D or the other one. Like it's some sort of rebel thing or something. People dont understand that so much of that shit is overdiagnosed these days. There's this one really stupid girl in 2 of my classes and she like brags about how bad her life is, she wants the attention so fuckign bad. I would be mean to her but Nick does it for all of us. It's just so annoying how fucking dumb and shit she is and shes like I have ADHD look here's my medicine, or I go to therapy!, or I smoke now, then its I quit smoking. WELL FUCK YOU I DONT CARE!  Then there's abuncha stupid fucks who run around saying oh I think I'm bipolar or he or she is bipolar. Well bipolarism is even more overdiagnosed by doctors than anything. FOr some reason everyone thinks that mood swings are bipolar and all this shit and they run around saying al this shit. I HATE IT SO MUCH, when people act like or think they know something and then they go tooting it off everywhere well fuck them those stupid uneducated, untalented, conformist, rich, preppy, unindivdual assfucks.

      Well.... my life is over. Got my report card today AAACCU.  I told my parents that the U was actually a D but that didn't fase them from pulling out every punishment they could think of, and not to mention getting yet another lecture about how this is "unacceptable" and how much potential I have blah blah blah. So now I have to resort to the old we are going to sit down every day and go over everything you're learning and all your homework. Also I get to stay for tutoring every day it is possible for mathematics. I was like hell no but I dont really have a choice. My parents are so hypocritical as well. They are making me organize myself the way THEY want me to because my sytem obviously isnt working. SUCK MY DICK. This will probably be my last post for a little while, not like anyone actually reads this piece of shit.

      I hate people who think their lives suck when they dont.  They complain complain about all this stupid shit that really doesnt matter in life such as...well stupid shit.  Like some rich ass hot mother fucking bitch with some beemer for a car who starts crying because she has to make her own dinner, or people who have friends and loads of them and they still arent satisfied with life, school, etc.  Fuck them, and Fuck You.  Like all the clicks at Ballard have pretty much formed for the time being. And I am glad to say I don't belong to any of them.  I don;t really have as many friends as all the other fucktards out there and I don't really give a rat's ass. So good for you all you fucking preppy rich fucks, the wanna-be rebels who are really rich preps on the inside, and the people who want to be preps and can't quite get there. All of whom use the word random out of context and way too often.

      My mom is seriously the biggest bitch.  I have a soccer tournament this weekend like 3 hours away.  And we reserved hotel rooms for Friday night and Saturday night, game one being at 11 o clock Saturday morning.  So midweek she is having doubts about going down tonight (Friday) and her doubts grow and grow. So today when I'm leaving to go to watch a soccer game shes like I'm gonna cancel the reservations. I couldnt believe it so now I'm stuck here and I get to drive for 3-4 hours to get to a soccer game.   Highland-3 Kammerer-1  2 Years in a row

      We had this math project to do right and so we got the design all down, I did it, and of course it was wrong so me and Peden had to do it all over again tonight. Shane the other kid in the group isnt doing jack shit FUCK HIM. But I was cutting the box to make our "pyramid" at Peden's house and shes as holding the box and then the box cutter like slipped or I followed through too much and i cut her thumb. LMAO I was like all shocked at first but then we both started laughing real hard although she was bleeding like fuck. And so then her mom was like STAY AWAY FROM THE BOX CUTTER! Then later it fell when we werent using it and I caught it between my ankles and the blade was out but it didn't cut me. I'm SMOOTH.  So today was Ballard FUCKING Idol. The stupidest idea ever, just for some people who think they can sing to sing and embarrass themselves in front of the whole school. Kind of like American Idol eh? But there was really only one good singer. There was a horrible ass rapper, a guy who cold sing but chose some song from a play so all of the niggers decided to boo him because the cant comprehend the words, some girl who had to read her lyrics, and a couple of other people who dont deserve mention. And of course there was some FAGGOT who decided to act like William FUCKING Hong and he wasnt funny although I was the only one who booed, everyone else laughed, stupid fucks. I guess it was worth missing class for although I was in health and we probably would have been in the gym so scratch that. We had free time in English which was fun because we talked about this burn out annoying ass whore who had ISAP today so she wasnt there to annoy us and take all of our cards. And this one kid kept being really homosexual and annoying as he always is.   And finally the US beat Mexico today 1-0 with a goal on the Last play of the game, HOLLER. But Landon Donovan cant finish and he should die.

      Fuck everything and everything, I don't really know what to think about right now. I have this assload of homework, I can't wait til soccer practice and this weekend's state cup although we are playing a national league team first and I'm starting, of course. School is biting my ass I am going to fuck around so much this summer and have so much damn fun you cannot imagine. Fuck school and all it represents, but what does it really represent except a dark hole of depression and anger for everyone who has ever been there. I dont think I'm getting a yearbook because I dont care about our hell hole of a school. So many of these fucks that run around all day being hyper or sad or whatever the fuck, and well yeah. I think I might get bored this summer (notice how I just changed my mind in a matter of 30 seconds) wow I am just ranting arent I. So in conclusion I quit life for the second time in a minute.

      Well.... I had a somewhat decent weekend. We had State CUp for soccer in Lexington. Our first game was at 10 and I stayed at Derks house because I dont trust my family to get me there. So first game we were playing Mockingbird White. They're in National League and ranked like 3rd in the state or sumthin. We have had bets going around about how bad we were going to lose and crap, you see we are bad and we hadnt won a game.  I was starting in goal and I was really nervous about letting the team down and crap. So, they were really good and we both started off really well. We were actually very even throughout most of them first half. They had much better chances but we both had an equal amount. I had like 3 good saves which made me happy and to our surprise we went into the break 0-0. We were hyped. As I was going to the sideline the manager approached me and asked if I wanted to finish out the game(I usually split halves with the other goalie) and I said Hell Yeah! I wouldnt have let him play the second half anyways. So we kept at it in the second half but we didnt have as many chances. About 20 minutes or so left Joey sent a cross in and their keeper went up for it and got it. Josh was standing there and form my vantage point just stood there but the keeper fell into him and practically threw the ball into the middle and Lucas put it away. We went CRAZY. I sprinted upto midfield to greet everyone I was STOKED. But we had 20 minutes left to play. We really dug the fuck in. They had the best player in the state by far and our D just shut him down. I had a couple of other good saves but for the most part they either missed the goal or the defenders blocked it. They were getting really frustrated and they kept getting corner after corner and chance after chance but nothing went in. Then on some free kick they crossed it in and some kid blasted it over the bar. I took my time going to get it, and I took the goal kick. Once our player touched it the ref blew the whistle to end the game. WE FUCKING WON! We went fucking crazy, everyone was jumping everywhere and on everyone. Our first fucking win against the best team we had played all season. And Mockingbird was pissed but we really deserved it, we really did.  So after that we had a game at 4 but that was like 4 hrs from then so we all hung out at Embassy Suites and ate at Denny's. We were all talking about how now we could make it to the semifinals and stuff... getting way ahead of ourselves. We had played the next team already, and lost 3-2 (I scored lol) and if we won we would advance.  That wasnt the case at all, we were drained from the first game absolutely drained. We went down 4-0 ealry in the second half and luckily took 2 back and made it 4-2 in the end. It really jepordized our chances.  So we were to take on another team we had lost to, LSA on Sunday at 8. I had to wake up at 5 fucking o clock in the morning. So I was starting in goal cuz it was my turn and I didnt play the last game because of the little deal or w/e.  I didnt give up any goals or anything and we were up 2-0 at half. We needed to win 4-0 and have Mockingbird beat Jackson Purchase by 1 to advance. Well we went on to win 5-0, with a goal by me, thank you very much. But Mockingird ended up beating JP 3-0 so we were eliminated by goal differential. The reason is cuz there was a 3 way tie at the top and the tie breaker is supposed to be head to head EXCEPT when there is more than 2 teams, then it is GD. But, the most goals that can count towards your GD in a game is 4 which sux so the only way was for Mockingird to win by 1. So it sux but considering we won our first 2 games of the season and beat a fucking national league team I was satisfied. Also a lot of heads were turned in our direction and we had a lot of fans from other teams within our club, it really felt "special" lol.  So on a somewhat other subject, I was talking to this girl online about State Cup and she had these friend on Mockingbird. Se was like " I heard you won on a bullshit goal by running into the keeper" I was like " I didnt have a very good view of it but it was something like that" and then I said "but we still shut them out so yeah" and she was like "I also heard that a lot of their shots missed the goal". I thought well wtf do you expect. Then I commented abot a save I had made on one of her friends and she was like "well which foot did he shoot with" I thought " why the fuck does it matter BITCH" then she was asking how certain ppl played etc. and there was this guy who has this really hard shot we were talking about and she was like "well _____ still goes to physical therapy" and I asked why and apparentyl he broke his hip sometime back. He has only been on crutches once at Ballard so it musta taken place like last year. I was thinking and wish I said " WHO THE FUCK CARES, GET THE FUCK OVER IT YOU STUPID BITCH QUIT MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS WHO LOST TO US BECAUSE WE WERE THE BETTER TEAM GOD FUCKING DAMNIT!" and I have always hated this girl because she always seems to find a way to turn something negative or bitchy.  And that wasnt the end of it. She was like "dont u guys play LSA? and didnt you lose to them?" I was like " yeah but it was a fluke" and she was like "That's not what I heard" I was like alright bitch FUCK YOU YOU ASIAN LITTLE MAN VOICE WHORE SLUT. Like give it up. So we beat that team 5-0 the next day in her face.  I really hate her A LOT and I wouldnt care if she read this.  That's all I can stand to type for now.

      Well life sux.  We have been disecting pigs in Biology class, and the first day it was fun but it's just stupid and stanky now. School is almost fucking over just like however many days we have is left.   This one kid I hate with passion, he thinks drugs are the way to get accepted by the people I guess he wants to be his friend or something. But anyways he thinks hes a dealer, always selling shit, ALWAYS trying to get money off of ANYONE and EVERYONE. He said one time that he would burn me a CD for 2 dollars when I have a fucking CD burner at my house. What a fucking dipshit. Every word that comes out of this kids mouth is either an excuse, a lie, or some stupid pointless crap. So anyways this kid thinks hes a dealer and he sux up to this one kid all the time and thinks he's like "in" with this kid. LOL was he wrong, I laughed everytime he said shit about this kid.  And today the guy he sux up to took a lot of weed off of him and didn't pay or nothin and it made me laugh, wut a little bitch lmao, he has no idea how many people want to kick his ass, he is the most dense piece of shit that has ever walked the Earth...lmao.

      William Hung, He cannot sing, American Idol’s joker thing. His A.I. tryout failed, Now he’s a star— What a bomb! Yeah, baby!  Sings off key Like most of us. Hearing his voice makes me wanna cuss. He’s so tone deaf, But he’s hittin’ the charts Like a star! Yeah, baby!  Well, if radio plays his CD’s, I’m gonna turn that damn thing off! I’ll let them know They lost a lis’ner. That boy just can’t sing! It’s so aggravating!   CHORUS: He sucks, he sucks! Oh, baby, Yes, he stinks, he stinks! I’ll go crazy If I hear that Hong Konger sing just one more note, I’m gonna go and slash his throat! He sucks, he sucks! I’m pissed off by the way he sings! Can’t sing! No one ever had a voice Like his, So, I’m gonna boycott stations playing him, I’ve got no choice.   William Hung, He’s just bad news. I’d like to hit him with my old shoes! Why don’t that William Hung go home And shut up? Yeah, baby!  Well, if you ask me, his voice is a crime, And he should be locked up for life! He came here to study engineering, But he’s no singer, So unendearing!

      I talked to this kool kid from MS that I hadnt talked to in awhile. Yea so I was readin these peoples journals, and it osunds like Atherton is a lot of fun. Everyone is having fun over there and i'm stuck in the Eastside at BALLARD which stands for sucky ass preppy rich school that is dark and dungeon like and everyone smokes pot.  Which gets me to my next point. That kid, who I passionately dislike ratted a buncha ppl out...or did he. It was leaked to the school that he told on a crap load of people when only he told on 2. He told me this in an IM and I asked my friend how much of it was the truth, because he was there and he said none. Well apparently the kid that ratted told abuncha other ppl his little story and they believed it. Originally this summer was going to be full of his ass kickings and now a lot less people are going to kick his ass. Which sux because I might hafta get my lazy ass up and do it for myself. In our little IM he told me to go out and make the A team. And that was pretty hypocritcal considering he was cut from the exact same team. Stupid faggot. He said all this shit about how he would ride me out and that I used to b a friend or something. I thought " Are you kidding me? You're the one who ditched me for a buncha people for no apparent reason. You're a wannabe, a fucking poser, you do drugs so you can fit in with every fucking crowd at Ballard, which totally backfired especially considering all you ever do is annoy people. NEWSFLASH: no one actually likes you we just put up with you. Now you know that I don't like you and nothing has made me happier this week. I just wish you didnt have the ability to lie the way you do, thats another thing, I really dont remember one thing that came out of his mouth being truthful. Everything was some sort of gossip, drugs, brag, or lie. The kid can't have an intelligent conversation with anyone. I honestly do not think I have had a more pure hatrid for anyone in my life, that IM was the best thing that could have happened, even if it ends up with im saying shit about me or wutever and turning people against me, it wont matter because he knows I hate him and he wotn be bugging me EVER AGAIN!  MY MOM WILL NOT QUIT TALKING TO ME, she needs to stop telling me to do stuff, or else I wont do it.  I think I have more stuff to rant about, but for now I feel alright enough.

You just did what you thought was best. I dont care about you any less for it. Kevin      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I know the feeling. [versesolochorus]     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Nikki or whatever it is, you dont know her mind your f*cking business just because kevin is your f*cking best friend or whatever doesnt mean you can get up in chelseas business. Leave her ALONE!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   That was incredibly rude, and completely unnessecary... she simply asked a question, and gave some advice. No need to be such an ass. Grow up.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   well...i went through ur ENTIRE diary missy...and i must say that u have by far TOO MANY SURVEYS! i mean one survey lasted for like 20 pages! that is just ridiculous woman! tehe...well i was bored and read ur whole damn diary! i think it is funny how like in the beggining u wrote like "hey wuts ^" and stuff and now ur all sophisticated (if thats how u spell it!) well runnin outa room! xox-erin     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   WOAH sorry mister I know everything, Mr. I can give everyone advice, Mr POOSIE. She doesnt know Chelsea why dont u mind ur business, u can tell her urself since ur such good friends, you can answer her question. And the advice...was "unnescessary" because it was bitchy and not needed so why dont you go somewhere else and give others your little (hugs) faggot     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   PREACH IT BOYO!

Do you have a point, or did you just want to insult me? Nikki had every right to comment with her thoughts. She wasnt being bitchy at all. You had no right to be so rude to her about it. Nor do you have any right or need to act like this towards me. As for hipocrasy, you shouldn't talk. You have no idea who I am, and will     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (continued) probably never meet me, yet you insult me and act like you know what you're talking about all the same. I would suggest that you grow up, as you've only made yourselves look more foolish.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   OUCH! That one hurt, another blow dealt by Dr.Phil aka Mr Maturity aka kevin. Give it up YOU LOST!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ... continuation yes I AM A FOOL AND IM PROUD OF IT, WHY ACT LIKE YOU'RE 40 WHEN YOUR 15-17 BLAM!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   OH MY GOD IM SO SORRY! I DINT KNOW I WAS INSULTING THE ILL HIGH BIG GRAND DALAI LLAMA OF POOSIES! and no im going to cry in the corner because of your super dooper vocabulary. I can never compete. YOU HAVE ONE THIS TIME POOSIE MAN! BUT IT AINT OVER!   can i get an amen!      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Of the 3 previous entries the first 2 were from one person and the 3rd one was from another. JUST SO U WERENT CONFUSED!!!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Its truely pathetic that you cant even manage to show some decency. I'm not trying to "win" anything. I'm simply defending my friend, who did nothing wrong. If you want to turn this into a flame war, take it elsewhere.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Aint not your diary so shut the f*ck up! Don't try to tell me what to do when it's not even your diary. "But it's Chelsea I care about, she wouldnt want this going on, Im just trying to protect my ex-girlfriend"

      I don't rant in this thing enough anymore, although its not like anyone ACTUALLY reads it. I get so lazy when I need to yell.  So I saw 28 Days Later 2 times in the past 24 hours. The 2 newbies as I like to call them both had trouble understanding it. You're lucky I don't disown you because 28 Days Later is like a test to see if you can be friends with me. Or at least I should make it be one. But who'd want to be friends with me anyways right?  Yea I entertained a guest on Wednesday or was it Tuesday. Went to a soccer game hollerd at some people and got free pizza. Then I think my house bored him to death. So yea prolly never see that kid over here again. We got some movies, was about to rent 28 Days Later and then thought hey why dont I just buy it. So I did and now I own a movie. Just seemed to not entertain the kid tho, musta been a comedy person. We did get Eurotrip which was mildly entertaining. Previews ruined a lot of the stuff.  I also seen Day After Tomorrow wit Chelski and Derk. Twas a good movie. It was weird cuz the last movie I saw (Elf) which was 3 or 4 months previous, I saw the preview for Day After Tomorrow and said I want to see that. And turns out it was the next movie I saw. (I thought it was amusing). There was this one part that was funny though in the movie but absolutely no one thought it was, I guess maybe it wasnt a joke or something but I was laughin hard and no one else gave it a thought but Chelsea laughed after I was laughing for awhile.  Yea, err so people annoy me a lot. A lot of people annoy me a lot. But yea, theres this one Rugrats episode where Phil and Lil were like you know the more time you spend with each other youll end up hating each other? Well I think that is kinda true. It happens all the fucking fuck time. So yes.  I hate the way things turn out. Period. Just period.  Me and Derk, got into this fight with Chelseas X Kevin. And it was very fun in fact I think I posted it below or maybe I am lying.

      Smarty Jones fucking lost. That was the most homosexual thing that happened today, considering that nothing else was homosexual today.  We had a game today, last of the season. We kicked ass, 2-0. I had no goals against and I played pretty good at sweeper too. I kicked the shit out of the ball like 20 times and it was fun. I intimidated the fuck outta this kid and he missed his pk. BAM.   Oh yea there was something homosexual else. Durin the game someone from their team cleared the ball and it went rilly far and into these woods/brush shit fuck. The ball was Warrens and those mo fucks dint even help us look for it. Actually it was just me n Warren which shows how stoopidly fuck gay our team is, but we were kickin the piss out of those tree/bush things.

      I vent to the US Women's game today. Had some fun I guess. I mostly enjoyed seeing the American goalies who were very very talented.  I fucking hate Kobe fucking Bryant. He thinks hes the shit at basketball and he may be, but hes a fucking rapist. He has no room to be showing off when he is gonna be in jail soon anyway. I'm gonna murder him and his whole basketbal dream if he doesnt get convicted just because hes such a fucking faggot fuck.

      No one comments on my blog or writes in my guestbook. Yall fucking suck.  My mom pissed me off so much yesterday it was not even funny. I was supposed to go to KY Kingdom yesterday. And I asked her at like 5 when I was supposed to meet everyone at 530 and the only reason she was takin me was cuz I was supposed to get a free pass from one of our season pass holders but they fucked up and forgot that they only work on certain days. So i asked if I could go anyways and she was like "Well how much is it!?!?" So since I had to pay now she decided she needs to look through her big huge folder of coupons to see if there is one for KY Kingdom. And of course she sits there and stuies every coupon so in turn it ends up being her sorting al of her coupons to see which ones she will need. So I start bitching at her and shes like shut up im not at your beckon call. You fucking told me you would take me bitch. So then she wants to figure out if htey have a night admission price and she was like call them up! And I say hell naw bitch and so that ended that. Until bout half an hour later she decided she'll call. Then I say it's too fucking late anyways. And shes like ok then we wont go. Stupid ass bitch does not know how to make a fucking decision to save her life.  My dad keeps lecturing me on the same shit and I'm thinkin hey I've heard this before like 7 times DIDNT WORK THEN WONT WORK NOW DIPSHIT. He says I need to go to summer school to have the teacher be there so it can help me, when eskool would help me do my homework because that is wht the fucking shit is.   So yea there you go for another shit day.

      I was lookin at this girls journal and she took the country quiz and got USA. It was totally wrong but I read the description of the country at the bottom and realized how true it was. Then I looked at the flag and thought wtf? It doesnt mean anything good anymore. All it shows me is a buncha invaders into a country and needless citizens dying for another country's people in a horribly poorly planned out "war" for no reason. I see a stuttering bafoon leader, someone who cant communicate with his people, and can't even stand up for his decisions. I seee abuncha crapped out politcians slowly degrading our quality of life. Our freedom is eventually evaporating, we have no leadership all it is is politicians talking about other politicians when neither one is suitable for the job.  IMO, President Bush used to be a President. But where the fuck is he. He's never in the White House. Never has been relay. He's always been in Texas or Camp David. How can you call yourself a President when you arent even working in your country's capital. Sir, you took an oath, and you have broken that oath. You aren't doing your best to preserve, protect and defend, you just want kids to read and you want to get rid of weapons in another country. Your not preserving the Country when you are sending uneccssary men to another country to die, when "all major combat has ended." I didn't think I could see anyone in office besides you, but if I had a vote, I would change it.   Woah I totally just thought of that by myslf.

      Ah yes, I went to the movies tonight. The movie itself was good, but the movies themselves suck. I saw Arry Pottah (Harry Potter for those of you who dont understand a good british accent). It was the best of the movies by far, but that might be because the books get better as they go along as well. They did however leave out a somewhat big part, although it didn't affect anything important. I'm going to ruin it for the 3 of you who actually read this. They left out the whole Quidditch Cup win, which IMO was a big part because it was the only like happy part in the movie/book, and in all the other books and movies the quidditch never finished. With the new director there was a couple of differences as far as the set,scenery, which bugged me at times but it wasn't anything major. I thought the movie was going to suck but I enjoyed it thouroughly.   Im goin to play footy tomoro finally although I have already played this summer. It shall be fun. We're going over to Sweeney's house after we get finished and we r going to watch good movies. Kelly has this thing at blockbuster where she gets 3 movies at a time anytime for 30 dollars a month. Tell me thats not kool. We're watchin 28 Days Later supposedly, which will be itme number 7 but I dont mind because it RULES. Kelly hasnt seen The Shining and she calls herself a movie buff. PFFFF, I spit at that.

       FUCK  anything and everything. I have had a renaissance of sorts when it comes to hating shit. I FUCKING  HATE  FUCKING LIMP FUCKING BIZKIT. FUCK FUCK FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. OK I'm done wiht the fucks, I could have done more, but Fletcher Memorial Home is keeping me in tune. Good song it is. BUt you know what song is a bad song? Fucking Limp Bizkit's gay fucking ass cover of  The Who's  Behind Blue Eyes. FUCK. I just compared the two side by side, and it made me almost have a seisure...literally. Limp Bizkit is SHIT...FUCKING SHIT. I'm not one to hate on people's taste in music but if you consider that nasty white trash piece of shit (Fred Durst), and his band "music" you're a fucking looney tone-deaf idiot. I trully mean this, if you like Limp Bizkit in any shape or form I HATE YOU and will never be your friend or aquaintance or anything. Exceptions going to Peden and Samo, because they are special cases, and they were misguided. Very misguided. I warn anyone who hasn't heard either version of this song, to listen to the original FIRST. There will be no turning back. If you do however like Limp's version better, I wish you no good luck ever in life and hope you parish in a horribly painful death. I'm glad I know and understand the music hierarchy unlike stupid people these days who catch on to every single fucking punk-pop-rock-emo shit band that comes out every fucking week. Now there's a few who have the right thing going down, but a lot of them are just re-using music and lyrics, ideas, and inspirations. Music is about expressing yourself not others. That is what a lot of these little bands have fogged in their poor misguided minds. Certain people liten to music from the 70s an 80s and even teh 90s and say oh this sucks, I don't want to listen to oldies. FUCK THAT, seriously you must have no musical sensor in your fucking body. Classic rock is just that, classic. It is the original, it started all of this stuff. But back then it had a meaning. Today's little bands only point in life is to get on MTV and TRL. I pause here to say, in the voice of Ms. Booshay " MTV IS THE DEVIL!" MTV is probably the stupidest thing that has ever happened to music. Video killed the radio star. UH HUH it actually meant something! Video's in my opinion ruin the songs, they can make them brilliant, but really, they can change the meaning of songs for people, and that in my opinion is just fucking wrong. Maybe you are a fan of TRL where you get to see like 30 seconds of each video. It's like those little hit clip shit fucks. Who the hell gets entertainment out of those? Well its the same as you people who watch fucking TRL god damnit. I think sometime in the near future I will post a list of all the bands who have, in my mind, sinned the art that is music.  Thank you, and goodbye.

      I'm in a fucking pissed off mode at the moment. I dont know why the fuck I annoy people but somehow I do. And I'm done trying to be peoples homeys when they're fucking gay. Fuck you, you think you're so good at life and shit and everything. Why do people have to have lives with nothing wrong in them. Or is it just me thinking my life is so bad. I know it's not, but why does this one peron hafta have everything seriously. He has a girlfriend, money, soccer, grades, friends, stuff to do...all the time. And then he goes and acts like an asshole when he comes over here. Fuck that shit.Fuck you, sorry to be an imperfection on your perfect little life. Will someone tell me why I even care lol. I need to find something/someone new, im getting sick of the sameness of my life.

      Sorry Alex, I had not an idea s to the location of my phone and it was also on silent mode. Be mad if you want but it wasnt my fault.  I saw Saved tonight with Aruna. Twas a good time. I only have fun with Runa when it's just the two of use but shes my favorite. THe movie itself was excellent. It was very accurate to most if not all points. It makes me laugh because a lot of christians were offended by what, in my opinion, is the truth. You'll have to see everything cuz I don't want to ruin it like what Sweeney did. But it really SERVES all the little bible huggers who cant take a joke. Actually I would say it was my favorite movie so far this year. It was a bit chick flicky but still it amde it's point very nicely. I want to see Farenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine because they looked really interesting/eyeopening/funny.

      Have you ever watched the little graphics on Windows Media Player or Kazaa. It intriques me sometimes, kinda kool.   I ready to burst out, I'm sort of sick of living in this shell. I want to just be free once, and let the fuck loose, not that im uptight or something. I don't mean some normal party or something, all it takes is sometime when I am enjoying myself greatly. We definately forgot about our water fight we were supposed to have! Shit Sara I needa call you because I will not let this not happen. Oh and it's more fun when you're in normal clothes because then you feel like you ruined something.  Dont you wish that there was music playing all the time. Wouldn't life be better if your memories in your mind had some sort of music attached to them. It's like when you listen to the radio or something and then you're thinking and its like hey this song goes. I htink it'd b kool if there was music playing like there is in movies. Sort of to add to the emotion and feeling in life. It would be cool.  I had like 3 relaly weird dreams the last 2 nights. First last night I dreamed I had been in a sort of Day After Tomorrow incident where there was a big flood and there were these HUGE waves and we got stuck inside and then everyone was scared to go outside because of the unknown. Then I had this dream that we were playing soccer in a gym except whenever I would look at the goals it would be grass on the floor and regulation sized goals but we were still in a gym. And we won the game, I woke up all happy because of the plays in that game. It was like the kind you would want to be a part of in real life. And the other was like this really scary dream. There was some sort of science horror killer on the loose and she like ate people and shit. And so like we were all in this one room of the house but it had a front door and stuff on it and it had a dead bolt. And we had like gathered our stuff and then we forgot stuff. And the lady was in the house and we had to rush to get this other stuff and my sister like got in the door and we locked it as she came up the stairs and she just went back down and later there was this lttle girl at the screen door (dunno why the big one was open) and I told them no its a trick she just wants us to get out of the room. And she ended up being upstairs and she just rather easily ripped the door off its hinges and came in, but she didnt attck me or my other sister she just came in and looked around, and I was doing all I oculd to suck up, you know how it is in the movies and your dreams. And then the dream ended, but I was scared out of my wits for somereason. I always like to have the off scary dream.

      I'm having normal teeange drama for the first time in a long long time, I would say since the beginning of 8th grade.  All these soccer tryouts are coming up which I'm not looking forward to because tryouts suck basically. I'm trying out for United and MAYBE Mockingbird, I haven't made up my mind yet. But the only way I would play Mockingbird would be:  1. If I got cut from United (which I am told is unlikely but who knows right, I mean I was supposed to make Ballard too.)  2. If me and Derek make the team and I am guaranteed by Mockingbird that I would be the only goalie on that team.   You see Mockingbirds B team is a division lower than us, and I would never make their A team (THE ONE WE BEAT AT STATE) so thats my reasoning behind both of my reasons.  Tripp wants me to tryout for Oldham County but after the gamesmanship they showed in our 2nd and even 1st game I would never ever want to be on their team.  So theres the soccer stuff, once its all over its off to soccer camp which shant be too bad, fun almost.   Then theres Ballard tryouts so we shall see what shall happen.  Found a good song called Tom Sawyer by Rush. It rules.

      Saw Saved again, for no apparent reason except that everyone I was with except for me hadnt seen it. I need to get away from the movies, too many trips there too often. I haven't been roading in awhile and that would be fun.  I have decided not to try out for Mockingbird because I don't see a reason to anymore. Also i'd like to maintain my shutout streak against all the White players. Griffin might be mad at me but he'll get over it. That's all that happend in my ever dramatic life (jk). UM yes, United tryouts are in 4 days, and no one seems to know about them. Joey, who is an idiot in general didn't kno and is gonna miss them , and he better be playing next year because he was our best player by far well not by far but close to it.

      Oh yea, Sam's dad signed him up for COMUTER CAMP, which SUX ASS, because thats fucking 12 damn hours of soccer, I would have no chance to rest. If he can't change to daycamp I might still go if Derek does, but Lopey and I was gonna go together and it sounds as though that shant not work out this year. I might do the "Professional" training wherever the fuck it is, and however the fuck much it costs.   Why do I do this when I don't even give a FUCKING damn if I make the team. SOMEONE TELL ME.

      I know I am probably going to regret not trying out for Mockingbird somehow I will regret it. The only reason I'm not doing it is because I have some sort of mental disarray in which I always see the lazy side of things, I always say even "if I dont do blank blank blank, blank blank will happen, it wont be that bad." And so I have done today, although I REALLY don't think it will have THAT big of an effect on my life, I just told GPaul I'd be there and I didn't tell him I wasn't going. I hope GOD doesnt decide to give me yet another wake-up call by not trying out. But why would he, honestly, I didn't tryout as back up plan A although it would have been really the same because they were actually better than us at the time. But I stayed with our team and look where we end up. Beating the A team from said club, that I would have been on the B team of. So even if I don't make UNITED I can still play for LSA or Oldham County, assuming I make it. I would rather play UNITED than Ballard any day and if I make Ballard and not UNITED I will prolly quit altogether and I seriously will consider it even though soccer rules my world as it is known through my eyes.  It's really weird though, the story of not making Ballard. To be truthful without boasting or anything, I was nowhere near the worst player. A kid who had been on my MS team who I was indeed better than, made it but he did not play very much. I was VERY VERY pissed when I saw his name on the list. I thought HOW THE FUCK. Like if he had not made it I wouldn't have minded at all about getting cut...period. And I still didn't/don't really care. Another thing, is that all my friends from MS who were all a year behind me, playing Varsity MS soccer, although some probably could have, made their High School team, albeit freshman even though Alex was supposed to be on JV. And yea well we didn't have a Frosh team so theres your story. I HAVE SOMETHING I COULD SAY HERE BUT PEOPLE READ THIS SO I WONT SAY IT. Aaaaaaaaannnnnnnd I don't care if I make the team this year because I'm gonna have an ASSLOAD of schoolwork, with 2 count em 2 Eschool classes on top of my already NOT EASY class list. I dunno how I am to survive 10th grade playing soccer every freaking day. And Sam actually wants to make the team, so if he made it and I didn't I wouldnt give a fuck either because I just told you why.   So there's my soccer story/rant.

      All the letters and shit are fucked up on my websites. Theyre all big and shit and its annoying the fuck outta me. Help.  I aint not wrote in a lil while and I dunno why. Lots has been happening.   Tuesday was United tryouts. That supposedly went well depending on what way you look at it. In the beginning we divided up into who was on the B team and A team the year before and the people who didnt play the year before I call them the "newbies".  So the newbies and the A team were playing a full field scrimmage and the B team went to a smaller field and played around. That was fun because it was just like practices which werent necessarily fun it was just cool to be around the old team again. So then it was our turn to play the newbies. Derek started out in the goal and I just stood around until it was my turn or whatever. But Derek was being a selfish ass and wouldnt let me play. So until after they got like 7 shots on him he switched out. I aint do nothing either. Then the A team came on the field and we played them. I made one decent save and had nothing else to do. Then I switched with Derek. Bratso who is the A team coach yelling for me to come over to him. He coached us for like 1 half of a game of which I played goal in so he had sort of seen me before. And so he was like "What position do you play in the field?" and I said I dunno and he was like well where would you want to play in the field and I said I guess forward. And then he said "See I can't get you in goal but here and there, but if you want to go out and play field I can look at you there." I responded saying that I intended to only play goal. He said ok and made me go in for TJ who is the A team goalie.  After one sliding save and one other touch of the ball tryouts were over. After them I was hanging around with Gpaul and Samo and Muhammed yelled over at Sam and was like "Get him, whats his name? Get him" and Sam was like "Brian?". They called me over and TJ, Bratso, and Muhammed were standing there and then Muhammed started talking. He said something like "We want you to be a part of the A team, would you be willing to accept a spot on International team?" I thought to myself "UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM" it was sort of a surprise except for the whole thing Bratso said/did in the middle of tryouts. So I was like "Yea" and he goes how sure are you and I said 75-25. He went on to tell me how much of a commitment and shit it was and how I would be working with Tabani and crap. And I was like yea I know and so on so forth. So basically what they wanted was soemone who was decent enough to challenge TJ for playing time on the A team. It was kinda cool being singled out like that, especially being at the first tryout. So I asked them to give me until Thursday to decide.  Fucking hell was it a hard decision. I didnt sleep normal, like when I tried to go to bed I couldnt sleep so I ended up falling asleep around 6am for 2 nights. I was a wreck and worse off I had no fucking clue wtf I was gonna do. I mean it was the A team. State runner up, National League, lots of stuff. BUT, playing on the B team last year was an assload of fun, and I had alotta homeys on the B team.   I went in Thursday with no idea wtf I was going to do. He picked sum people to play in a scrimmages so most of us got a little break to sit and chill. We played a bit, I made like one dive and like nothing else. And then Bratso put in a whole new squad and it was basically the B team so I was like this is chill now I can yell at people. And like right at the end Jeff netted on me even though I got at least 4 fingers to it. Bratso called everyone over and he said some little speech and he was like I'm selecting 22 players that I want to see. So he did so. I was picked alongside Lucas, Jeff, and Josh from the B team. He took Griffin my homey and some other Mockingbird player. And the whole A team from the year before minus 3. And like 2 other newbies. Some of the people I didnt tell were like look at Brian amking the A team blah blah. We had a lil 11v11 scrimmage and then Bratso made his final cut. Muhammed was there to watch and was like have u decided about what we talked about on Tuesday and I said no. I felt like a douche saying that and then Bratso was naming off people and he took Griffin. So I was like well.............. and then I just decide alright I'll do it. So Bratso asked me if I had decided and I said yea I'm playing. And so there you have it. I am now a member of the 89 United Internationals. Woot.  And so my dilemna was supposedly over. I was relieved that I had made up my mind. But then I found out that the B team was basically the same people as last year. I was like oh well. Then yesterday we got an email from the A team manager and it was asking me to sort of officially accept my position on the team. It sort of made me regret my decision. For some reason. I just thought that you know the B team would be fun and its not as much pressure. But I had basically already committed so I wasnt going to back down and sent her a conformation email. So................ I still sort of regret saying yes to A, but I think its really cool I actually made A. But who the fuck knows. I have 4 months to get in the best shape of my life and work my ass off to get playing time. I think I'm up for it. I wish I knew whether playing Ballard would help me get in shape for it more than just doing A LOT of shit myself. I guess we will find out when I tryout.  I'm going to camp in like a day which sort of sucks but not really because it's gonna make me get started. It's pretty fun most of the time too, so it will be cool.  Nothing else really happened except I got tricked today and the littel faggot fucks who are behind it are gonna die, but they already have it coming for them so I dont even have to bother doing it myself.  Peace out yall  I think this is my longest post haha.

      What the fucking fuck? Im fucking lost in the black hole that is my life. Maybe on the outside I seem normal. I dont see how that is...but on the inside it is FAR FAR FAR from normal things going on in here. I needa escape someone take me on vacation or something. You stupid bastards who get to go on vacation. I wish my father and sister werent going to Chicago. I wish I could give the tickets to 2 of my friends so we could be on our own. That would be cool. 4 15ish year-olds alone in Chicago. Lol that would kick ass actually. Too bad my dad is an arse and my sister wont give her ticket up for no one or nothing.

      I start freaking goalie camp in like 5 hours. Why I signed up for it? I DUNNO. To get better and some shit like that. But its gonna suck. And you know what makes it suck worse is that I cant sleep and its 4:11 am EST. So whatever I am really sick of being an insomniac and having a fucked up sleep schedule.

      I want some god damn pizza. For fucking real.  I missed camp today, wasnt really my fault. My alarm clock is ga-hetto and it didnt go off. Sam was calling me but I had my cellular on silent so...  According to Derek it was mui easy, and I honestly couldnt care less.  Also pizza is good.

      Camp is now over. It wasnt that bad actually. Last year was much harder based on a combination of things. Last year I wasnt exposed to GK training and the kind of stuff they do there. And also this year we did a little bit less than last. I got good ratings on my evaluation which pleased me. In the PK shootout however Derek was a fucking faggot and made me retake my PK then saving it. Fuck him. For the finals it was this one little kid versus a kid from Nelson County. Patrick picked some little kid to play goal for the other little kid and for some reason he made me play goal for the Nelson County kid. Turns out this Nelson County kid is the same one who missed a PK against me in our last game of the season. So I pick the direction I am going. I fake to the other way and then move to that side. Well he hit it the other way (against my guess) but he nailed the post. So now the kid has missed 2 PKs against me...I like to think its becuase I'm just so intimidating.  I have a huge ass bruise/knot on my hip and it hurts like a bitch.

      My computer sux majora asso. It can lick my balls.   I played like crap the other day and I got really angry and punted balls everywhere.  Tryouts are in a week... most likely be ranting about this more...but at the moment I dont want to play because I dont expect to make it and I dont care if I do. I will play if I make it but only to satisfy my dad who thinks I am better than I am and also because I need to since I will be on the A team this year.

      Theres only one thing I dont like about soccer.  It always makes me nervous and anxious and shit. I can never have fun when tryouts or something is coming up because I'm always nervouse or tense about it. I guess it's like I dont want to do anything or get ran or stuff like that but I always get all stressed and  shit and it sucks. And it seems like I always end up having fun anyways. Which is weird. But I still cant believe that it wont be that bad I still have to think about the bad shit and so I still end up getting stressed. I really hate it.

      Fuck Kobe Bryant. I really hope is arrogant ass goes to prison for a good amount of time assuming he gets convicted. He thinks hes the best player in the world hes having fucking teams come to his god damn house to sign him. The Lakers are making him the center of their franchise it would be sweet (?)irony/karma(?) if he got convicted leaving them with nothing.   Today (its 1am) begins soccer tryouts. I dont know what to think. All of a sudden I cant say that I dont want to play. I mean if I didnt make it I guess its expected  but if I do make it I guess its a bonus? I really need to play and for somereason I cant imagine myself not making the team. But who the fuck knows. I know that because of my laziness disease I dont want to go the damn team conditioning but I will most deff suck it up because its just gonna be like that or worse at United. Ah why do I have to change my mind. Now I'm gonna be disspaointed if I dont make it.

      Jim Rome has the stupidest opinions on sports. I hate sports critics. The ones who write their little "columns" only to generate conflict and readers. Im pretty sure they dont even mean what they say I mean their ideas dont even make any sense.   The whole world is over analytical I'll rant when I get back.   I might also do these surveys which I havent ever done in one of my blogs.

      Everything and everyone is pissing me off. I'm sick of everything. I havent been able to listen to my music in like 2 weeks because my comp isnt working and its all on it. People in general piss me off. Just the way "these" people are being/are just pisses me off. I mean fucking hell. I wish people respected other peoples taste, opinions, views, music, interests, etc. Fuck people who are like that. I feel so alien sometimes. Theres stuff I do for fun that doesnt entertain people enough and I get "looked down upon" because I'm not interested in the same things as whoever. Fuck that, why cant people just fucking respect shit. I wish the world wasnt so GAY.  I have such complex thoughts. My inner "being" is so much different. I think way too much and analyize shit deeply and way too far. But I like it. It seems like other people I know are so empty. They just exist they dont think about stuff they just do whatever. I dont see how people get along in life without imagination or expression. Stupid people who follow the crowd, PREPS, GOTHS, etc. FUCK im also sick of putting labels on people but its SO DAMN TRUE. I'm a hypocrit mother fuckers LIVE WITH IT.  I fucking NEED my FUCKING MUSIC!  I made the god damn soccer team. Yay? The coach was like "if you're one of the ones who isnt here monday (the ppl who got cut) you're lucky " so we have conditioning for like a week and a half or something. I'm so not looking forward to it, but I'm actually glad to be on the team and if I can get through this next week of SHIT I can do pretty much anything. The only thing that sucks is that the team fucking sucks. So yea fuck.  I'm sick of _____ you pick what I'm sick of because it probably fits.

You jock people and all their ideas and funny shit, you are and example of everything I hate in the world. I hope you rot miserably in your new school, and I hope you know that wherever you go the people who have shit against you will find you. Oh yea and you're a NARC BITCH.  After that I dont feel like bitching about anything else, that kid is a faggot and still doesnt realize it so beware.

      Well we had a little mini controversy right here. To prevent furthur problems for me regarding someone else...cough cough lets not discuss who yall were discussing. Danka shane.  Day two of conditioning went by. I hurt all over and have no idea how I will make it through the length of time we are training with this coach but I will have to somehow.

      Well shit...I forgot what I was going to say.  Our conditioning coach is the biggest asshole I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. Today he was like "I dont think one lap really warms you up, do you guys? From now on we will be running a MILEto warmup!" I was like dude you are fucking gay. We had to run it in 7 minutos and 30 seconds. Which thankfully I did with a few to spare. But then like 10 people finished after the alotted time and only some of them would fess up to it. So he tried to make us all run it again in 6:30 but he just started yelling and told us to go strech. We proceeded to actually go play soccer which was sort of fun but all we did was drills.

      Today was last day of conditioning supposedly. We hadta run a mile at the beginning in under 7:30, as usual, and I did it in 6:30 which is the fastest I've ever run a mile. I was quite pleased.  Sunday sunday sunday....Sunday I'm going to CHICAGO, to watch my favorite club team in the whole wide world play Timmy Howard and Manchester United. SO STOKED I am! Its gonna be tizite. I think we are going to go around downtown a little bit before we go to the game. It's being aired Tuesday at 12:00 noon on channel 55 Fox Sports Net Ohio. It will be on Fox Sports World live at 3:00 central time. CANT FUCKING WAIT YALL. Aint even funny how stoked I am.

      I seen Anchorman tonite wit Aruna. It sucked major ass. It was prematively funny but at times I wanted to leave badly. There was one funny part, it had absolutely NO plot whatsoever. Do not waste your time.  Anyways, Day 4 of conditioning came and went. It wasnt too hard but it was hard enough. That stupid asshole Rob who is our "conditioning coach" showed up with like 10 minutes left. So I only heard his gay fucking ass voice once today. Tomorrow is supposedly our last day with him but it'll probably be the worst day of my life. I guess I'll get over it.

      Well what a weekend/Monday and Tuesday.   Sunday was THE GAME in THE CITY. It was in all honesty the coolest thing I have ever done in my life. Traffic really pissed me off badly though. It was slow from the skyway all the way to the stadium. We arived 15 minutes into the game, but nothing had happened so it was all good. Bayern Munich who is my favorite team played all their stars unlike Manchester United who played abuncha young kids and like 2 recognizible people. I was mad about that. Plus Tim Howard didn't play which means I now I have a list of things to do before I die, and number 1 is to see him play now that he skipped out on us. Anyways the game itself was actually bad for soccer. Had I been watching it on the tele I would have been very mad. I wasnt dissappointed however just because it was so cool to be where I was and everything. I saw Oliver Kahn and that was one of the big things. Anyway the game ended 0-0 and the crowd booed the shit out of both teams. Twas very very loud. And then they announced there was gonna be a shootout to decide a winner because that was the format of this series/tour. And Alan Smith who was making his debut for ManU and is a well known player shot and Kahn saved it. It was awesome I jumped out of my seat and was like the only one near me because a lot of the fans there were there to see ManU. And Kahn ended up saving another PK and Bayern won the shootout 4-2. I was stoked. It was oh so cool. You cannot imagine.  Monday was the first soccer practice. I played like total shit. It was temendously wet and I kept dropping balls. It was really embarassing.  Today was picture day for soccer and we got goalie jerseys with the resto f the field player unis. They were sort of ugly but I actually sorta liked them. I always tilt my head in pictures and I tried not to today and the guy had to make me readjust my head and I didnt think I was doing it but I guess I was.   I played better at practice following pictures but I still gave up 2 goals I wish I hadnt have. And that leaves me here... sort of. After some ammusing drama, so later.

I dont give a flyign fuck about going back and seeing whoever the fuck I didnt care about 2 months ago. Fuck it all. All I shall do is go to school, exist if even that, come home do shit, and then go with the few or numbered real friends I have and have fun on the weekends and exist until next summer. FUCK SCHOOL. FUCK BALLARD. FUCK EAST END RICH ASS PREPS.  I played better at practice today. Made some damn good saves and only messed up like 2 times. I still need to get better at some stuff. But Derek didnt say but 1 thing to me that was bad today. I did however hurt my thumb which sucks ass.

      I hate that little christian loser click that exists. Well clicks themselves suck but these people think they are all "individual" and crap. Fuck that shit. And they hang out with Tripp the fucking faggot fuck. Do they not know what he did? I mean seriously who would hang out with someone who narced on like 30 people just so he didnt get expelled and then he ends up not even going to our school anyway. If you cant take the shit you are going to get then why do it. He fucking narced to save his own ass and then he expects to be able to tell everyone and make some damn excuse up everytime it comes up. Even now when everyone knows he still thinks he can lie his way out of it. Stupid fucktard he is. I wish I could just get my licks now. And then he goes and files a lawsuit every fucking time he gets touched and tries to fucking frame a kid. Fuck that, he made a fucking false charge up and had a kid sit in jail for 5 and a half ours. Fuck that shit. That kid deserves what hes gonna get and I wish I can be there to see him fail at life. I cant wait until we play him in soccer oh my it will be fucking hell. No one will give a fuck how fucking violent it will be. I personally and know of others who will not care about cards and everything. The kid really should not want to play against us.  Ok, I'm done caring about whatever the fuck is going on in that little story for now.  No one is online right now. Usually someone is on at 3am but noooo not tonight.  School starts in 2 god damn weeks. I swear I am seriously not looking forward to school. Itll be the 2nd or 3rd worst day of my life. School sucks and I hope this year goes by fast as fuck so I can get the hell out of Ballard.   Soccer isn't going too awful good. I have had one good day of practice and I hate the god damn freshman who are on the team. They all suck except for one kid and theres also a good eight grader. But the frosh are fucking annoying as hell and I can't wait to bitch them out in games. Assuming I play, I'm worried that I won't get to play the games I want to and I hope the coaches give me and Sam equal time and/or ask me and him how we would like to split it up. My thumb is still fucked and it's making me mad, it doesnt help that I have like no break to let it rest. I even played today and like shit. It was sort of a waste of time, the grass was long as fuck and we all werent playing good and I wasnt really trying. So basically all it did was get us tired and make me jam up my thumb again. I think I'll just tape a spine to the thumb of my glove tomorrow so I'm not as hesitant to go down and slide, deflect with both hands, and catch with both hands.  I have to do the fucking recycling fuck/  I'm getting real sick of all the bitching that goes down in my household. My older sister keeps talking about her car accident, which I guess she has reasoning to but it gets old when she talkse about how her friends are going on about their "injuries" when the "werent injured" and how stupid they are. She has reasoning and everything I'm just getting sick of it. The younger one keeps bitching about the soccer team and how she wished she was on Varsity and how she should be on Varstiy. And then she starts going on about her little "injuries". She thinks her ankle is messed up or something and she wears a brace on it every chance she gets. All she did was fucking roll it. She's such a whiney ass BITCH. I really dont care about her little injuries and shit. Spare me. Then she goes on and on about how much attention the older one is getting because of the accident and how her birthday is ruined and no one is caring about her birthday. She needs to get used to it, I havent had anything fun done on my birthday in years but do I care, not really. She has enough shit as it is and she keeps saying "Mom I better get ____,_____,_____,_______ and ______ or else you'll be sorry!" Fuck those bitches have like the biggest ass bills from American Eagle and Gap and all those prep stores. They spend SO MUCH DAMN MONEY, it's not even funny. They yell at me for getting $200 cleats once a YEAR when they spend $600 in clothes every MONTH. It sickens me. I don't get anything except soccer stuff and I dont care. They get clothes every god damn week and they want more and more and more.  Ok I guess I'm done for now. Later haters.

      Some of me wishes more people read this but then again I think why do I think that. I do not use LJ because Blogger is less complicated and stuff. It dont go no damn gizmos and shit that I dont give a flying fuck about.  I was looking through my yearbook and I realised how little I want to return to Ballard. I dunno how bad the first, second, third and all 174 days of school will be but I think the first is the worst, especially this year. Seeing people after summer is so GAY everyones all fucking giddy and shit and I'm like WOO SHUT THE FUCK UP dont you realise school has started. Freedom is gone dumbshits. If you want to start school I resent you for life.   Soccer sucks I still feel as though I am playing like shit yet everyone tells me different. I do not believe what they say, I think they lie.  I do so often what it is that a preach about hating. Like prejudgment. I say that preps are asses and shit because they are, but also I say that they dont give people chances etc. a lot of times I dont eithr but it's usually the preps I dont give chances etc. so I guess it works out in the end anyways.  Me and Griffin had a little chat earlier about what we would do when or if we play Tripp in soccer. If you would like to know a funny thing I thought notify me, I don't want to put anything here for fear of a future lawsuit filed by the fag himself.  Peace

      Well soccer had its ups and down today. There were 3 or 4 goals I thought I could have saved. I still feel like I'm not playing as good as I am (although I'm not good). I took a crack at about everybody today everytime I went in on a slide i ended up knocking someone over, including the varsity coach lol. They need to learn that they're supposed to jump over me unless they want to get cracked. So the rest of practice people backed off of challenges against me.   Other than that I did nothing today. Sam invited me over but my mom decided I couldnt go, although she had no god damn reason.   Also question for the 5 people who read this. Should I get "GK" on the back of my hoodie or the number 1?
