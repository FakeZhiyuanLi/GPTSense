      When their elder son was married two years ago, Mary Rose and Sabah Nasser invited 400 guests and rented out the posh Alawiya club for the reception. The family hired the best band around and danced into the morning. Then the wedding party cruised in cars around Baghdad clapping and singing. The happy couple honeymooned at the Rasheed Hotel, the best the city had to offer.  For weeks leading to the day of their younger son's marriage recently, Mrs. Nasser, a devout Christian, says she knelt before a framed poster of the Virgin Mary in her living room and silently prayed, "Please, Lord and Mother Mary, let there be no explosions on Ziad's wedding. Please, God, keep car bombs and guns away from us on Friday. Amen."    Every week, hundreds of Iraqis get married and start new lives. Almost every wedding has to accommodate the security nightmare gripping much of Iraq. Insecurity comes in many forms in Iraq these days: American military actions, terrorist attacks, and robbers and kidnappers targeting ordinary Iraqis for a profit.  Many families don't hold a celebration at all. Those that do usually take extraordinary measures to ensure their guests' safety. Iraqi weddings now start in the early afternoon, for tea or lunch. They end by 5 p.m. so guests can be home before dark.  In a culture in which flash and extravagance suggest social status, low profile is now the order of the day. Hair salons catering to brides open as early as 7 a.m. on Thursdays and Fridays, weekend days in much of the Muslim world that are popular for weddings, so brides can be ready for early afternoon fetes. Florists make house calls to decorate the bridal car, so they don't attract attention at their shops. Caterers and restaurants complain that they have to serve food in haste so guests can hurry home early. Bands grumble that playing in the blazing afternoon heat isn't cool.  "Weddings are supposed to be care-free, happy occasions," says Bassam Hannah, the director of the Engineer's Club, which rents out its banquet hall for weddings. "Now it makes me very uncomfortable and nervous to have weddings here. I sit in my office and look at my watch and want everyone to leave early."   • Coalition Cedes Control to Interim Iraqi Regime           As for the wedding of Ziad and Rana Al-Bandar, the Nassers' son and new daughter-in-law, "Ninety percent of our planning was focused on security and safety. It was like I was preparing for a military operation instead of my own wedding," says Ziad, the 26-year-old groom, who studied computers in college but couldn't find a job and now owns a women's accessories shop.  The bride, Rana, an 18-year-old college sophomore who is studying pharmacology, was no more at ease on the eve of the big day. "I remember my friends who got married before the war were nervous about their dress, make-up and party. But I don't think about any of that. I wake up at night worrying whether the day will end safely."  The couple first planned to wed last year, in the spring. But the war broke out and they kept putting the date off. Security continued to deteriorate and, in January, they finally settled on June 18.  Rana's uncle, Dr. Samer Mikhail, who became her guardian after her single mother died two years ago, was anxious about the couple having a big party and tried to talk them out of it.  Ziad's family felt the same way. "I offered to give all the money for the party so they can go to Jordan or Syria and have a relaxing time together," says Sabah Nasser, a gregarious civil engineer educated in London. "Can you believe a father asking his son to take his joy and happiness somewhere else?"    But the pair were determined to have a party. "If we gave up our dream, it would equal defeat," says Ziad.  First, the couple kept the guest list to about 100 and settled for an early afternoon reception. Ziad spent days driving around the city checking out hotels and banquet halls for the reception.  He found that nearly all the nice halls were shut down or located in unsafe neighborhoods. All the good hotels in Baghdad have been taken over by foreigners -- mainly journalists and contractors -- and have been turned into fortresses encircled with concrete blast barriers and machine-gun-toting guards. At hotels, wedding guests would be required to pass through checkpoints and endure body searches. They would have to leave their cars outside and walk through hundreds of yards of labyrinthine barbed-wire passageways to reach the party.  A second option was to have the reception at Ziad's parents' house. The home, a beautiful old two-story house with a big well-tended garden, is in many ways perfect for the occasion. But it is located in a largely Sunni Muslim neighborhood, where loyalty to Iraq's former Baath regime is high and anti-American sentiment runs strong. They worried that one of the frequent U.S. military raids or an attack on U.S. troops might occur in their neighborhood during the reception. They also worried a noisy party could attract kidnappers or robbers who might follow guests when they left.  At last, the couple found a bland hall in an obscure alley in central Baghdad. It wasn't pretty, but it was just what they were looking for: no heavy fortifications, no armed guards, no foreigners and a banquet hall with a large generator to provide electricity in case of a blackout. "It's almost normal," joked Ziad.  To minimize the risk to guests of driving around Baghdad, the couple picked a church near the reception hall for the ceremony. They had to pass up the Nasser's church, which is near the family home and whose priest had married every male member of the family before Ziad.  But just as things were falling into place, a close call nearly caused Ziad to cancel everything. A week before the ceremony, he and his mother were driving to deliver wedding invitations to relatives when they heard gunshots. A car sped past them and gunmen opened fire on another vehicle parked on the side of the road. With masks over their heads and AK-47s in their arms, the men shot the driver, abducted the passenger and made off with the car. Ziad screamed for his mother to duck. She kept telling him to calm down. Afterward, he stopped on a bridge on the way home and sobbed.  "We don't want electricity, we don't want food. We just want our normal life back," said Mary Rose. "I want to go to my son's wedding and not be afraid of someone dying on the way."  On the day of her wedding, Rana woke up at dawn to get to the hairdresser by 7:30. Her maid of honor packed her a brown-bag breakfast. She didn't dare wear the gold jewelry Ziad and his family had given her as a wedding gift. The gold, along with her ring, traveled in a locked box hidden in the car. She donned it for the ceremony. Immediately afterward, it was removed, locked up and hidden once more.  Guests filed into the church at noon, in 120-degree heat, followed by a luncheon reception. When Mr. Nasser got out of his car, the banquet hall's doorman congratulated him. "Thank you," he said, before whispering to the man, "please be sure that no strangers park their cars around here."  Still, the couple and their guests danced with joy. "I want to forget I'm in Baghdad," said Ziad as he gyrated his hips to the beating drum of Arabic music.  By 6 p.m., after the guests and the bride's family had left, the couple sat in the Nassers' living room surrounded by his immediate family. They had decided it was too dangerous to stay at a hotel. American helicopters hovered nearby, and a faint sound of machine-gun fire could be heard in the distance.  "It wasn't perfect, but it was still our wedding and I had a great time," said Rana. Her husband squeezed her hand and smiled. "And there were no explosions, thank God," he added.

      Ads That Make You Go Ew Who buys hot dogs because they're "girthy"? By Seth Stevenson Posted Monday, June 28, 2004, at 5:56 AM PT      The spot: An obese man is tending a barbecue grill. He's cooking some Ball Park Franks. He says he likes his hot dogs "girthy." He keeps repeating that word—claiming he likes "the way it rolls off my tongue"—as he holds the frank up to his mouth; issues a guttural moan; and wraps his lips around the big, swinging dog. In all, he says "girthy" a full seven times. (Click here to see the ad.)   "Girthy" is not a common word. You don't hear it very often. When you do hear it, the context is generally penises.   Back me up here, people. I'm not crazy, right? This term gets used most frequently in discussions about male endowment.    Continue Article   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Now, I swear, I know this only because I once did a piece on the porn industry. The story never ran, which makes my excuse seem even flimsier, but honest, I had to do lots of reporting. I toured smut studios outside L.A. I visited sets. I met starlets, and directors, and porn addicts. They at times would use the word "girth," and I assure you they weren't talking about frankfurters.  A quick Nexis search shows that "girthy" made it into print only 23 times in the past year. Three times it refers to ears of corn (it appears to be commercial farming jargon). The New York Times employs it to describe an opera singer (of course they do). And oddly, it appears in four separate stories in Guitar Player magazine (each time, the word refers either to guitar necks or guitar sounds; all four stories are by a writer named Art Thompson—who either had an ongoing bet with friends, or was in a real bad adjective rut).   Ah, but there it is, just once, in a usage not so chaste. Thank you, University of Houston Daily Cougar! You know what I'm talking about. So do the readers who sent me e-mail asking about this ad (one writes that with "Frank's tone and pronunciation of the word, it's almost impossible to avoid some extremely unpleasant sexual connotations with the product"). A Web search (I don't recommend it) confirms my thesis beyond any doubt: This word is a dirty word.  Especially when it gets put in a hot dog commercial. Repeated over and over, in a lascivious tone. Followed by satisfied grunting. We have to face it: Hot dogs—sometimes called "wieners"—are a little bit phallic. So, wouldn't you try to avoid using words that bring this to the fore?   I've no doubt that many hot dog consumers also perform fellatio. And more power to them. But do they really wish to contemplate this act while noshing on a frank at a barbecue? Also, are they Ball Park's target demographic? In a corporate press release, spokesman "Frank" is described as a "straight-talking, All-American" guy who "believes in red meat, cold beer, [and] spectator sports …" I hate labels, but this sounds like your classic straight dude. Not so much a fellatiator.  In the end, we're left with two possibilities. The first is that Ball Park, and their ad agency, were unaware of the connotation. I can imagine how this might happen. Were I at the planning meeting where this ad was first pitched, as, like, a junior executive or something, I would not want to be the guy who brought up penises. So, maybe no one brought it up.  The other possibility is that Ball Park knows exactly what it's doing. That somehow consumer research has proven that folks like the hot dog/penis connection. It must have been a doozy of a focus group.   Granted, the ad is winning lots of attention. People are talking about it. I'm writing about it. I guess this could be a publicity-grabbing strategem—anything to steal the spotlight from market leader Oscar Mayer.   But I think it's tremendously dangerous to associate your food product with something that people really don't want to digest (that German cannibal dude aside). There was a spot this spring in which a sweaty guy rubs a Coke can around in his armpit, then hands the can to a friend who unknowingly drinks from it. Coke's president at the time, Steven Heyer, was a supporter of this ad. Some board members at Coke were, to put it mildly, not. Heyer has since stepped down and will soon leave the company.   Grade: F. I think many people, upon seeing this ad, will avoid buying Ball Park Franks. That's pretty much the acme of terrible marketing. Alternative: I am wrong, and Ball Park has happened on a brilliant—and profitable—means of letting straight men express their sublimated homoerotic fantasies.

      Snacks: Outstanding Marathonsession Food for Gamers    I have eating issues. As Theted can tell you, I have a tendency to forget to eat for days on end. I just...forget. As Rob can tell you, after a day or a couple days of not eating, I can eat an entire pizza in one sitting. I looked at the health content on a Papa Johns cheese pizza (link)...and freaked out. No wonder gamers are in such crappy shape! Eating that junk all the time, along with whatever sugary snacks that are available? Ack!   I wracked my brain, trying to come up with a good snack food. One that was low on fat, low on salt, low on simple sugars, would provide enough sustenance to equate to a small meal, and could be eaten without heating or cooking first. As a corallary, I also wanted to find something that didn't encourage me to pursue other nasty food. I mean, come on, other than beer and coke, what REALLY goes well with pizza?? I came up with one thing that met all of the criteria: dirt. Not exactly what I was looking for, seeing as I wouldn't want to eat it in the first place. I decided to make my own gamer food, with a long and clunky name that abbreviates to OMFG--much easier to use than the actual name, so just go with that.  I came up with a bizarre bastardization of a popovers. They're in the oven right now--I'll have to let you know how they turn out. Incidentally, I found a way to encourage water drinking instead of soda drinking....I included 3/4ths of a cup of Cholula hot sauce (SIGNIFICANTLY less sodium than Tabasco or Emeril's).

      Low Blow Dodgeball hits audiences over the head with its stupid, juvenile (but sometimes funny) humor. By David Edelstein Posted Friday, June 18, 2004, at 2:57 PM PT      Nice pecs, Ben   The explosion of interest among grown men in dodgeball—i.e., throwing balls very, very hard at people while trying not to get hit by balls being thrown very, very hard at them—confirms what many of us have known for some time: that American males would love to have a little toggle switch that would make them, in an instant, 12 years old. (Given their druthers, they'd probably switch it back only to get laid and buy beer.) It's too bad that the new comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (20th Century Fox) doesn't explore the psychology of this familiar character, dubbed the "rejuvenile" by the writer Christopher Noxon. But the movie, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, is pretty much a manifestation of the rejuvenile phenomenon. Modeled on such slob-comedy '70s/'80s hits as Meatballs (1979) and Caddyshack (1980), it's coarse, primitive, regressive, often very stupid, and sometimes, against all odds, really a hoot. Just watching grown-ups get bombarded by rubber balls, you know? Makes me feel 12 again.  The movie's premise is established so lazily that the script might have been written by its hero, Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn)—a feckless ne'er-do-well who runs a cruddy Vegas gym, Average Joe's, full of dweebs, nerds, geeks, and, for variety, outright loonies, like the guy who thinks he's a pirate and goes around saying, "Arrrr." For some reason (most of the picture's plot turns could be prefaced, "for some reason"), the owner of an upscale corporate super-gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller), decides that he wants to put Average Joe's out of business—although he'd hardly want its clientele showing up at his place. He sneers, "In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit heap you call a gym into nothingness." Faced with the demolition of their beloved gym/community center, the dweebs/nerds/geeks/loonies decide to enter a national dodgeball competition in order to win $50,000 to—Sorry, it's too demeaning to summarize.  So, unfortunately, is Vaughn's performance. His character is meant to be noncommittal, sloppy, and dispirited, but there must be a way to act those things without being them. Bill Murray, the genius of the prototype, brought an air of grace to degeneracy: He really appeared to be on a higher astral plane, far above such bourgeois concepts as hygiene and manual labor. Vaughn has no subversive wit, no comic motor, nothing. You want to see him slammed with balls just so he'll react.    Continue Article   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Stiller, at the other extreme, has enough energy for 10 clowns. It's true he's insanely overexposed, but at least this performance is a change of pace—a return to the demented extroverts he used to play on his old Fox variety show. He's muscled up here, with huge bronzed arms and a swollen chest—which means he gets to make fun of bodybuilder morons and still have us think, "Nice pecs, Ben." That said, Stiller has always been disconcertingly built up, like the quintessential runt in the Charles Atlas comic book ad who has had sand kicked in his face too many times. He uses that massive chip on his shoulder to give White Goodman real pathos. Every detail—from the feathery blond mane to the mutton-chop mustache to the toasty voice that keeps cracking to the gyrating pelvis—is an act of self-flagellation. The icing on this masochistic beefcake is that Stiller gets to put the moves on his own wife, Christine Taylor (as a bank lawyer who ends up on the dodgeball team), who is repulsed by him to the point of nausea and who gravitates to the barely-awake Vaughn.  The picture's wild card is Rip Torn—the ultimate chuckling nihilist bastard—as the wheelchair-bound dodgeball founder Patches O'Houlihan, who makes you laugh when he shows up and keeps you laughing until his untimely (and poorly staged) exit. Patches trains the team by pelting them with extremely heavy objects, with the movie's sound people helpfully overamplifying every bruising thud. The dodgeball competition sequences are a riot because they're edited not for coherence (coherence and dodgeball don't go together) but maximum pain: Bonk bonk bonk and lots of ouches and wounded glares. Nothing like getting slammed with rubber balls to bring out the blubbery child in a person. Dodgeball is junk, but now and then it's a scream—a primal scream.

      ne early clue that Texas prisons had a new contraband problem was a letter, intercepted in a routine mail check, from a mother telling her inmate son that she was putting more minutes on his cellphone.   Then there was the mother who wrote the warden complaining about the poor reception for her son's cellphone.  But Texas officials say they learned the seriousness of cellphones' being smuggled into prisons only during a recent undercover investigation of a violent gang, the Texas Syndicate, when electronic surveillance showed that a gang member was making and receiving calls on his cellphone from the Darrington prison, near Houston.   When investigators raided the inmate's cell, he flushed the phone down the toilet. But the prison has traps in its sewers, and when the authorities checked the traps, they found multiple phones.  Prison officials across the country say inmates' possession of cellphones is a growing and serious problem. In recent months it has led to arrests or convictions of scores of inmates and of prison staff members who have smuggled phones to inmates.

      Canada Day Background  How we got our national holiday   On June 20, 1868, a proclamation signed by the Governor General, Lord Monck, called upon all Her Majesty's loving subjects throughout Canada to join in the celebration of the anniversary of the formation of the union of the British North America provinces in a federation under the name of Canada on July 1st.   The July 1 holiday was established by statute in 1879, under the name Dominion Day.   There is no record of organized ceremonies after this first anniversary, except for the 50th anniversary of Confederation in 1917, at which time the new Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings, under construction, was dedicated as a memorial to the Fathers of Confederation and to the valour of Canadians fighting in the First World War in Europe.   The next celebration was held in 1927 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation. It was highlighted by the laying of the cornerstone by the Governor General of the Confederation Building on Wellington Street and the inauguration of the Carillon in the Peace Tower.   Since 1958, the government has arranged for an annual observance of Canada's national day with the Secretary of State of Canada in charge of the coordination. The format provided for a Trooping the Colours ceremony on the lawn of Parliament Hill in the afternoon, a sunset ceremony in the evening followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display.   Another highlight was Canada's Centennial in 1967 when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II attended the celebrations with Parliament Hill again being the backdrop for a large scale official ceremony.   The format changed in 1968 with the addition of multicultural and professional concerts held on Parliament Hill including a nationally televised show. Up until 1975, the focus of the celebrations, under the name "Festival Canada", was held in the National Capital Region during the whole month of July and involved numerous cultural, artistic and sport activities, as well as municipalities and voluntary organizations. The celebration was cancelled in 1976 but was reactivated in 1977.   A new formula was developed in 1980 whereby the National Committee (the federal government organization charged with planning Canada's Birthday celebrations) stressed and sponsored the development of local celebrations all across Canada.   "Seed money" was distributed to promote popular and amateur activities organized by volunteer groups in hundreds of local communities. The same approach was also followed for the 1981 celebrations with the addition of fireworks displays in 15 major cities across the nation.   On October 27, 1982, July 1st which was known as "Dominion Day" became "Canada Day".   Since 1985, Canada Day Committees are established in each province and territory to plan, organize and coordinate the Canada Day celebrations locally. Grants are provided by the Department to those committees.

      Former New Democrat MP Svend Robinson will plead guilty Aug. 6 on a charge of theft over $5,000, his lawyer said Thursday.  Mr. Robinson did not appear during a brief hearing in provincial court in Richmond, but defence lawyer Michael Bolton told reporters that Mr. Robinson will plead guilty next month.   Mr. Bolton said Mr. Robinson “has indicated from the outset he'll be accepting full responsibility for his actions.”  Asked by reporters if that meant he will plead guilty, Mr. Bolton said: “That's what that means.”  The charge was put over until August on Thursday after special prosecutor Len Doust told Judge Dennis Schmidt that more time is needed to complete the disclosure process.  Mr. Robinson will face a range of penalties from absolute discharge to a maximum of 10 years in prison.  The seven-term MP for Burnaby-Douglas took a sudden medical leave from federal politics in April – stepping down from the job he has had for 25 years after admitting to the theft a tearful press conference.  Mr. Robinson described the months leading up to the incident as a time of "severe stress," and said "something just snapped" when he pocketed a ring during a public sale at an auction house.  Mr. Robinson said he did not know why he took the ring, but was in agony over the incident. After trying to contact the auction house owners without success, Mr. Robinson called the police instead.  "I will not seek to in any way avoid full responsibility for my actions should charges be laid in these circumstances," he said in April. "I have sought and am receiving professional medical help to understand and deal with these issues."  Federal Auction Services Inc. of Brampton, Ont., issued a release shortly after the incident saying it accepted Mr. Robinson's apology and would not pursue criminal charges. Vancouver police subsequently filed charges.  Canada's first openly gay MP, Mr. Robinson was serving as federal NDP spokesman on Health and International Human Rights and had been Deputy House leader since February, 2003.  A member of the NDP since the age of 14, Mr. Robinson was first elected to the House of Commons in May, 1979, to represent the riding of Burnaby-Douglas.  His former constituency assistant Bill Siksay retained the riding for the NDP in the June 28th election by beating Liberal star candidate Bill Cunningham.

      In an increasingly bitter electronic-snooping case, Air Canada now suggests that the success of its leading Canadian rival, upstart WestJet Airlines Ltd., is based partly on access to Air Canada data obtained through ''corporate espionage on a massive scale.''  "Since January, 2000, WestJet has approximately tripled its share of the domestic market while other low-fare airlines are struggling to become slowly established or have failed," Air Canada's lawyer, Earl Cherniak, says in a factum filed in Ontario Superior Court on Friday. "There is substantial evidence that WestJet's access to the plaintiffs' confidential information has contributed to its recent success."  The big airline, poised to emerge from 15 months of bankruptcy, is suing WestJet for tapping into its seat-booking database through an internal website open to employees and retirees seeking flights on which they would qualify to fly free on a space-available basis.  WestJet, in return, accuses investigators hired by Air Canada of illegal trash-napping at a WestJet executive's Victoria home. Air Canada says it retrieved shredded documents from garbage put on public property.  The factum says: "Through the misuse of the plaintiffs' confidential information, WestJet has been able to schedule its existing routes and enter new routes much more effectively and at much lower risk. . . . In essence, the improper use of the plaintiffs' confidential load factor and flight booking information has given WestJet a significant and unfair competitive advantage in the very competitive Canadian airline industry."  It says that WestJet "was able to easily determine not only the plaintiffs' most profitable flying times on any particular route, but also the times when market demand appears to be strongest and when passengers might have a willingness to pay higher prices." It also says that the smaller airline "has recently announced its intention to commence flying regularly scheduled transborder routes which it selected after accessing the plaintiffs' confidential information."  Those assertions have not been proved in court. The document outlines facts, law and arguments on which Mr. Cherniak (who also represents Air Canada's Zip Air subsidiary) intends to rely in a hearing on Thursday. Among other things, he seeks to compel WestJet to preserve and disclose records of data obtained from Air Canada.  WestJet communications director Siobhan Vinish yesterday declined to discuss the alleged link between snooping and success. "The matter is before the courts and there's a lot of information that's being circulated in documents such as this one that have yet to be proven."  WestJet issued a statement last week denying that data on the Air Canada employee website was confidential. It did not deny looking at the data but said that none of it "was ever used by WestJet for any purpose." It alleged that any losses suffered by Air Canada were the result of mismanagement, underpricing, a high cost structure and poor treatment of customers.

      A crow found in the Parkland Regional Health Authority on June 25 has tested positive for West Nile virus.  As of June 29, 171 birds have been submitted for testing for West Nile virus (WNV) in Manitoba.  The bird surveillance program began May 5.  * The first positive bird identified this year was found in Winnipeg on June 19.  * There have been no human cases of West Nile virus diagnosed in Manitoba in 2004.  * Manitobans can help detect the arrival of West Nile virus in their area by reporting dead crows, blue jays, magpies or ravens to Health Links-Info Santé at 788-8200 in Winnipeg (outside of Winnipeg toll-free 1-888-315-9257).  Links to pictures of these birds can be viewed under bird surveillance at http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/wnv.  * Testing birds from the crow family provides an early indication of West Nile virus in an area.  Once testing has demonstrated the presence of WNV in a specific area, no further birds from that area are required for testing.  * Handling and disposing of dead birds and small animals can be done safely.  First make sure that the animal is dead to avoid being bitten or scratched.  Avoid touching it with your bare hands.  Use a plastic bag or shovel to pick it up.  After sealing the bird in the plastic bag, wash your hands carefully.  Dispose of the plastic bag in regular garbage.  Health Links-Info Santé and the Manitoba Health West Nile virus website have further information on how to safely handle a dead bird or animal.  * Few species of mosquitoes were found infected with West Nile virus in Manitoba in 2003.  The species of primary interest for human risk, Culex tarsalis, depends on hot weather to build up to high numbers and is often present in drier weather.  This and related species are most often found in standing water that may be polluted with organic material.  * Most nuisance species of mosquitoes depend on wet conditions associated with frequent rainfall and are usually found in relatively clean, fresh water from rainfall or snow-melt pools.  Current mosquito surveillance shows the large numbers of mosquitoes in Manitoba at this time are nearly all nuisance mosquitoes.  * While the risk of West Nile virus is expected to increase over the summer, at this time, the risk of human infection with West Nile virus in Manitoba is considered very low.

      But the crowd in the control room abandoned its reservation just minutes later, letting out cheers and trading high-fives as a translation of the radio signal indicated that Cassini's engine had begun its planned 96-minute long burn. The brief celebration was followed by at least a half dozen bursts of cheering and applause over the next hour and a half as the incoming signal revealed that Cassini was meeting each of its goals for the SOI as planned.  Still, the most exciting moment came at 9:12 p.m. when mission controllers announced that Cassini had completed its engine burn, marking the first time a spacecraft had ever entered into orbit around Saturn.  Project planners and most everyone else in the control room jumped out of their chairs, many of them hugging and shaking hands. "It really confirmed today that Cassini is a great instrument," said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, project scientist for the European Space Agency's Huygens probe that is piggybacking on Cassini.  Though the SOI marked the end of a six-and-a-half year journey through 2.2 billion miles of space for Cassini , it was just the beginning of its main mission to study Saturn, its rings and its moons.  Only minutes after completing the engine burn, the spacecraft reoriented itself to begin taking measurements of Saturn's magnetic field and photos of its rings. It was the ideal time to gather this data, since the maneuver placed Cassini within 12,400 miles of Saturn's cloud tops -- the closest it would ever come to the planet or its rings in the entire mission.  By midnight, however, the spacecraft had sped back through Saturn's rings and had signaled back to the control room on Earth that it was ready for its next task.  The probe will now use its 12 instruments to learn as much as possible about the Saturnian system over the next four years. During that time, it will complete 74 orbits around Saturn, 44 fly-bys of the mysterious moon Titan and 13 fly-bys of other moons.  Saturn has 31 known moons -- most of them vastly different from one another -- and scientists say they hope to discover even more by the time the mission is over. They also hope to learn what many of those moons are made of and whether they contain elements that are considered to be the building blocks of our solar system and of life itself.  To that effect, Cassini has already proved that it is living up to its expectations. On June 11, the spacecraft came within 1,250 miles of Phoebe, a dark, icy moon that orbits Saturn in the opposite direction of all its other known moons. That fly-by revealed that Phoebe harbors pockets of frozen carbon dioxide, a feature that makes it highly likely that Phoebe originated in the Kuiper belt, a region of debris left over from the birth of the solar system.  On Friday, Cassini will make its first pass by Titan, the only moon in our solar system to have its own atmosphere. The dense smog circling the moon is thought to hide vast ethane lakes, raging lightning storms and a large object thought to be a tall continent or a deep crater. The conditions mirror those on Earth billions of years ago, according to planetary scientists.  "It's really a planet in its own right," said Cassini project scientist Dennis Matson, suggesting that Titan may once have orbited the sun before being captured by Saturn's gravitational pull.  Cassini will study Titan again and again in the coming years. However, the climax of these fly-bys will come on Christmas Eve and in the weeks immediately after. That's when Cassini releases the Huygens probe, allowing it to drift down into Titan's atmosphere, where it will take as many measurements as possible before crashing into the moon's surface or splashing into an ocean of ethane.  "I just hope -- maybe dream -- that we'll see oceans on Titan," said Breton. "It would be very exciting to land in an ocean." But, he conceded, the actual composition of Titan's surface is anybody's guess at this point.  What Cassini measures and photographs from above and what Huygens gathers on its way down is sure to be considered a discovery.  "I don't know what we're going to see," said Breton. "We'll have to wait six months to tell you."
