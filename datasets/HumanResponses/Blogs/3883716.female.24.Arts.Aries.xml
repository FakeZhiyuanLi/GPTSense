      for being as punk as i am, i'm usually a pretty mellow pig. but, sometimes, due to Jess's insane schedule, i don't get to come out of my pen for days at a time.  this sucks.  but last night, i got my revenge. when she tried to catch me, i ran circles around the sofa, really fast! like, really, really fast! we are talking superhero fast!  it was badass!  don't mess with me!  xoxoxoxoxxxxx  cyd vicious

      Yesterday, Jess bought&nbsp;me some of that yuppie bagged lettuce stuff. I ate&nbsp;it underneath the sofa,&nbsp;and it got me to thinking, some lettuce is intrinsically more badass than other lettuce.  Frisee, for instance. That shit is in your face. It's all spiky and bitter and badass, like me. If I were lettuce, I would totally be frisee. But only if it had a different name, like razorweed or killsley.  badass.  oxoxox cyd

      I met a new friend last night, and though he was nice and all:  1. scratched me behind the ears 2. said i was a "great guinea pig" (fucking right!) 3. demanded that i be let out of my pen immediately 4. and decided right away that i must be named after Sid Vicious (badass!)  he was no PAUL.  Paul is one of my best friends, because we are both badass. When you are as badass as we are, you have to stick together. Because other people just can't handle it. I mean, sometimes me and Paul bust out with some real hard core shit, and everyone is just like, "whoa."  I miss Paul. He and Nicole need to come over and fuck some shit up. But I liked this new guy. Of course, I'd like him more if he came with red leaf lettuce.  xoxoxoxox cyd.

      A new bag of hay. A&nbsp;fresh bag of pellets. Litter. A brand new hammock to replace the one I destroyed yesterday. &nbsp; I was feeling very punk rock. &nbsp; Jess yelled at me for trying to destroy the stack of City Papers in the corner of the living room.&nbsp;It's dumb to keep destroying the legs on the end table, because she lets me do that. &nbsp; So I destroyed&nbsp;my hammock. For the third time.&nbsp; &nbsp; NOW SHE CAN BUY ME A NEW ONE. &nbsp; badass. &nbsp; xoxoxox &nbsp; cYd

      ROME (Reuters) - A retired Italian man could face up to a year and a half in prison if found guilty of killing his six pet hamsters and one guinea-pig by throwing them off his terrace into passing traffic.  The man, detained by police after the guinea-pig crashed into the windshield of a car, told officials that he had accidentally knocked the animals off his terrace while sweeping, AGI news agency reported on Thursday.  Police in the northern coastal town of Imperia discovered the hamsters' bodies littered across the street after the motorist complained about the broken windshield.  By studying the trajectory of the pets' bodies they were able to identify the man's apartment. Under a new cruelty to animals law, the man could be sent to jail for between three to 18 months for killing the pets. He will also be held responsible for the damage to the windshield.   If I ever meet this man, I will pee on him and bite his feet off.  xoxox cyd

      Jess still hasn't bought me a new hammock.  This is so far from badass, I could scream.  BUT, she did give me a paper bag, as a stop-gap measure. It was fucking awesome for two whole days. I hid in it, chewed peepholes in it, and took long, luxurious naps. It was wonderful. Comfortable. Lightweight. Very D.I.Y.  And I sort of felt like destroying it.  So I peed.  Jess needs to buy me a new hammock, damn it.  xoxoxox  cyd

      Bar tab at Frijoles last night: 107$ !!! For three people! Isn't that insane?  At least the bartender&nbsp;didn't make me pay for my food. I think everyone forgot about my food, even though it was delicious and involved mountainous quantities of beans. They put crack in the refried beans there. Seriously. I am addicted. Benn is addicted to the tilted windmill. Rachel and I tried "secret" drinks with incredibly effeminate, decidedly un-Mexican&nbsp;names("Two Tickets To Les Mis" and "French Bathrobe"), invented by a bartender who looks kind of like Ian Curtis, once you've had enough Frijolejitos and talked about Ian Curtis long enough. And haven't we, this week? HAVEN'T WE?  Anyway, lesson learned: Don't go out drinking when you feel sick. I don't even know what I'm even doing at work today. Maybe I will go home early, even. And even watch some Buffy and drink some ginger ale, even.  Ugh.  I wish I could go to Estrofest tonight, I really want to see Vestal Vermin and Secret Crush Society. Not to mention my odd fascination with bellydancers, induced by repeated childhood viewings of U2's ZOO TV tour video. Plus they have pretty clothes. Maybe if I feel better.  Two If By Sea is playing in D.C. tonight&nbsp;with some gamine-looking folk singers and some DJs and some shit. That's my little plug for that, though I won't be going, because I feel like crizzap.  xoxo j-money

      This week is kicking my ass. Things are picking up, Goucher-work-wise, and I have some sort of weird cold that makes me feel like my head is floating above my body. Combined with my recent state of mental flux, this is not a good thing.   But the sun is shining, and the Best of Baltimore meeting amused me(I am sworn to secrecy on the results, but suffice to say some awesome things/people/places will be getting their due, as a result of me interrupting Richard Gorelick, Wendy Ward, and other full-time staffers), and Nicolina and I plan to hit our favorite sketchy Persian place for lunch. Hopefully a steaming bowl of asch will make me feel better. And some hummus. I wanted to hit the gym today, so I need to catch my second wind.   Robitussin, anyone? DM, please.   Many thanks to j-ratt for finding the Ian Curtis videos I was coveting. They're interesting to watch, in light of my fiancee Thom Yorke's famous flailing dance style. Also they kept me from working for fifteen whole minutes. Next I want to read the 33 1/3 book about My Bloody Valentine's  Loveless . I was listening to that last night whilst playing Final Fantasy X-2 and literally chasing Cyd around the apartment, because the little fucker wouldn't go back in his pen.   Figures.   xoxo  j.   Current music: Loveless, My Bloody Valentine; Live Box, Bjork; Asobi Seksu, Asobi Seksu   The link to the dancing, for any curious parties: http://www.enkiri.com/joy/videos/videos.html

      Last night turned out to be odder than I expected...I stayed in due to rain and exhaustion, and got up to my usual tricks...watching White Zombie (a film from the 1930s, notable for its rasping, bone-crunching sound effects), reading Flowers In The Attic(that's some fucked up shit, yo) and reading a 33 1/3&nbsp;book about the making of Joy Division's&nbsp;Unknown Pleasures.   It was raining really hard, but I sat out on the balcony anyway, reading, and when I got to the part about Ian Curtis's debilitating epilepsy, all kinds of memories and bile&nbsp;from my own experiences came rushing back to the surface, sensations and feelings&nbsp;that&nbsp;I hadn't thought about in 10, 15 years. I felt really edgy for a few hours,&nbsp;keyed up as all fuck,&nbsp;before I realized that I was probably just experiencing the combined effects of a grande caffe americano, my usual medications, and the Tylenol PM pill that hadn't kicked in yet. So.   Drugs are bad, kids. Even over-the-counter ones that are made fresh&nbsp;for you by smiling apron-clad hippies with master's degrees! Don't do drugs!   TODAY is the City Paper Best o' Baltimore meeting. I hope I can contribute enough drivel to secure more than one category to write about so that I can write lots and lots of blurbs and earn a fat check. That is my run-on sentence dream.   Current Music: Psychocandy, the almighty JAMC; ( ), Sigur Ros; anything else that will calm my jangled nerves.   &nbsp;  xoxoxox   j.   P.S. I really, really, really want to see a video of Ian Curtis dancing. Anyone who can point me to one on&nbsp;el Internet will earn apotheosis.

      Well, the first practice of the Machine Age Lovers went surprisingly well.&nbsp;Tiff and I&nbsp;swigged bourbon, put together a bassline with an interesting little fill in it, and listened to Chuck nervously&nbsp;caterwaul and shimmy his way through a really depressing sounding song. Rock? Not so much. Spectacle? You bet. We "meet" again next Monday, possibly at a "practice space," with a "drummer."   Me: "So, the Machine Age Lovers. Does that mean we love the machine age, or are we&nbsp;kids who&nbsp;get it on during the machine age?"  Chuck: "Yes."  After "practice," a whole bunch of kids came over to Cris & Chuck's to watch a documentary called  The Weather Underground , about Vietnam war revolutionaries/terrorists. It was interesting, and sobering, and long. Afterward, everyone was just sitting around being intellectual, so I skipped over to Club Charles to meet up with Yuri and Lori, who were celebrating Y-Dogg's 24th.&nbsp;He was utterly delighted with the "Real Viper"&nbsp;I picked up for him at the Royal Farms, and kept hitting Lori with it, screaming that he had a "new reptilian&nbsp;friend." Love that kid.&nbsp;We ended up watching another documentary, called  Mr. Death , about this engineer named Leuchter who was heavily involved in revisionist history disproving the existence of the Holocaust.   This at 3 A.M.  My brain hurts.   In other news, the new edition of Splotch has hit the internet, including a middling-to-unembarrassing short story by yrs. truly.&nbsp; Check it out at  urlLink www.splotches.org  if you've got time to kill. Also check out new art by the ever-scrumptious Marc Fanberg and&nbsp;Adeye Deresse.   In more personal news, I really need to stop being&nbsp;paranoid and untrusting. Seems like I'm always bracing for&nbsp;the disaster, instead of enjoying & embracing&nbsp;the good stuff without fear of rejection. It takes a lot for me to trust someone, and in the past few days, I've discovered how much it takes. For someone who prides themselves on being laid back and easy going, I can work myself into a hell of a state, for no apparent reason.   This possibly&nbsp;points to the real reason why I always had a crush on LeVar Burton when I was a kid--he was honest, upfront, and you never had "to take his word for it."   Just my paranoia getting the best of me, I guess. I knew it would...it always do...

      >yawn.  Another Monday, kiddies. I had a good weekend...Friday at Frijoles, Saturday riding a horse, jamming with bluesman Eric,&nbsp;and kickin' it with&nbsp;my kids&nbsp;at Britpop night...you haven't lived until you've been chased by giant&nbsp;rats through the alleys behind the Ottobar, whilst trying to keep hold of someone's hand and avoid being hit by cars. Frogger, anyone?  And finally, I spent Sunday seeing the guy from the Homosexuals make an ass out of himself with leather pants, an MLK-emblazoned jacket, and much faux-punk posing. It was the saddest&nbsp;rock spectacle&nbsp;I've seen in a long time, honestly, ever&nbsp;since the time I saw the Sugarhill Gang huff asthma inhalers onstage. DJ Jazzy Tiff and Mary Smith rocked the upstairs bar much harder.   Today is, apparently, the first ever practice of the Young Machine Lovers. I wonder how long they&nbsp;can stand my noodling bass "skills" before kicking me out of the "band."&nbsp;Svengali Chuck&nbsp;says he doesn't care what we sound like, as long as it's "hot."   At least I'll be in tune. I bought a battery for my Quik-Tune and everything.   &nbsp;  as you were...  j.   &nbsp;

      The title of this post will only be amusing to those who have seen the seminal internet cartoon Zombie College. Which means, essentially, no one but me. Ah well. Zombie College! Zombie College! All right, I'm done.   I've decided to write a zombie column for the Mobtown Shank. This will ooze pus all over the travesty that was Emily Flake's pirate column, and quite possibly eat its brains. Look out for it.   Today is all about shopping. "Why," you ask? Because TODAY,&nbsp;Anthropologie has&nbsp;opened a branch in the uber-evil Towson Town Center. Anthropologie is its own kind of evil, because the clothes are way, way too expensive. And I am a fashion whore. No apologie.   Plus I just got paid!!!   Lunch break isn't coming soon enough.   xoox  j.   Addendum:&nbsp;Skirt, 2 shirts, underwear, and a motherfucking SOAP&nbsp;DISH. Fashion whore. Retail slut. &nbsp;

Please suggest any categories that you'd like to see in the annual BoB issue...I'm having trouble coming up with any, myself, and the first committee meeting is on 7/28. &nbsp; Short story forthcoming in  Splotch . &nbsp; Seeing Dillinger Escape Plan tonight, The Hives tomorrow night. &nbsp; Eschewing full sentences. &nbsp; xoxoxo j.

      I actually have a fair amount of work to do at work today, which is kind of cool. I am also hungry, and violently happy due to beautiful night air, vegan food,&nbsp;and boat watching. Followed that with an&nbsp;impromptu Bible study at Eric and Brad's, and a nice, hazy episode of BTVS. &nbsp; Yes, geek. I don't care. &nbsp; Why are all the bars in Fells Point so stupid? I never go in any of them, but I don't need to to know that they are horrible, pastel-drenched dens of crappy cover bands, Abercrombie-wearing winos, and businessmen out on the piss. &nbsp; I say this, despite the fact that I own a pair of Abercrombie cargo pants and work 9-5. &nbsp; Ahem. &nbsp; This weekend is Artscape. Get your arse down to School 33 in particular, their indoor/outdoor&nbsp;"Doppelganger" show looks compelling. Also, Goucher's Rosenberg Gallery has a classy show. And of course you need to eat a funnel cake, or an elephant ear(do they&nbsp;make those in MD?) or&nbsp;something equally deep fried. And get drunken. And check out the rock--Two If By Sea is playing on the UB stage on Sunday afternoon, and in my rather biased opinion, they kick ass. &nbsp; Rather biased indeed. &nbsp; Ahem. &nbsp; Current music: Neutral Milk Hotel, In The Aeroplane Over The Sea; Bjork, Post; Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Fever To Tell; Velvet Underground, Loaded.

Tonight marks the end of my six(6) day streak of going out on the towne, for the illustrious jules352 is coming to visit me. It'll be weird to be home for the night.

And let's not forget the new, more expensive apartment I just moved into.  But that's enough whining.  There are rock bands at the ottobar tonight, and I won't let this slow me down.

      This is the blog.  I've named it "Garden of the Jungle Gods" after a great postcard that my friend Lisa sent at me. Maybe I will sneakily use the scanner at work to post it on here. It's a pretty badass picture. Also badass: my liver, which has been taking quite the beating over the past few days. Holy Frijoles is the devil. As is Frazier's. As is the fact that I have a case of Heineken and a bag of fireworks in my car(aka The Delicious Piece of Toast).  Cyd has been eating parsley. I have been working on a short story about some stoners who accidentally resurrect a zombie dog, after consuming a lot of hallucinogenic cantaloupes which cause them to believe that their mustard-colored sofa is a giant rescue barge. This comes hot on the heels of the new, ongoing book project, which prominently features an orange knaugahyde sofa. (And here I wonder why agents say my work is too avant-garde).  I cleaned my apartment this weekend, which is quite an accomplishment considering that my lifestyle has been of the "come home, eat, change clothes, leave" variety. Not that that shows any signs of stopping, though.   Current music: The Twilight Singers, Blackberry Belle (thanx, Iseli); Substance, Joy Division; Bjork Live Box

      This week should be good--Goucher's closed from the 18th through the 20th, so I get a paid 5 day weekend. Part of it should be spent someplace sandy and sunny, damn it. I'll have to see how that pans out. I've got a hefty amount of freelance work awaiting me(Best of Baltimore blurbs, an article on manga), and it would be nice and responsible to deal with some of that. So I will.  Yes. Riiiight.  Lunch at Frijoles with Nicolina today, and heading to the o-bar later to drink my dinner. I should be able to squeeze in some writing and a workout before then. This is the first week in a while where I don't have a long list of rock shows to go to.  I feel lost. Abandoned. So alone. Oh, rock shows, where have you gone? How can I survive? How am I supposed to live without you? Why am I channeling Michael Bolton? BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ROCK SHOWS. Oh, it is a vicious cycle.  Even the almighty  urlLink www.pheer.com  is letting me down.

      It's a Sunday, and I'm hanging out at K7HD and Angela's place, looking after Sasha, doing my laundry, watching Rufus Wainwright concerts on the telly, and playing Doom 3(!!!). I went for a long hike at Loch Raven earlier, as well--a much-needed chance to clear my liquor-and-nicotine-addled head, accrue bug bites, and frighten deer.  Feeling good.  I saw two of my favorite local bands this weekend--Two If By Sea down in D.C., and Chester Stacey at the Talking Head. The rock was brought by all concerned.  Reading  The Rum Diary  by Hunter S. Thompson, and one of K7's books, about the cultural significance/history of tattooing. Looking forward to a relaxing evening of crack smoking and the History Channel.

      Okay, I've been accused of the "scenester" thing more than a few times. I know people who know people who know people. And yeah, I like me a rock show or a eurotrash dj night now and again. ("Now and again" meaning three to four times per week.)  But there's an ugly, callow, catty, and disturbing side to "the scene" that I really can't stand. People all up in my shit! Asking questions they have no right to ask! Making assumptions about things they know nothing about! You know, relating/making genuine connections with people is hard enough without a roomful of people speculating about who you're spending time with, and why, and to what ends.  Too many cooks in the kitchen, kids. Too much high school in my dj night. Get out of my stew!  A rather wise bookstore owner(Rachel) sez that "gossip is currency." She's probably right, and if so, I would like to enact some sort of recession. Or, maybe I should just run up to everyone, randomly, and be like "Excuse me, who are you sleeping with?" "How are those herpes working out for you?" "Did you pee today?"  I'll be the richest girl in the room.  xoxox j.  p.s.   Interpol's bass player is hot as hell.

      I didn't obey the Frijoles craving last night...I didn't even leave my house, to be honest...this week's review is kicking my ass, and coupled with the fact that last week's review(in this week's issue of City Paper, for all y'all who are on normal schedules), wasn't quite up to snuff, imho.  Several things are plaguing my mind this morning:  1. I've discovered an amazing invention. Tomato soap! It's by Burt's Bees, it's bright red, and it looks fucking awesome in my soap dish! The soap dish's many fans will be well pleased.  2. Sometimes I fantasize about chasing our secretary around with exacto knives. This morning, she announced that I "look pale." Well, thanks, "mom." I ALWAYS LOOK PALE. It's a whole side effect of, oh, I don't know, being IRISH and spending large amounts of time cloistered in pitch dark rooms writing! Please don't think I'm flying off the handle here, for this is merely the latest transgression in a long parade of annoying, cloying announcements from said secretary.  3. I don't have any quarters to do my laundry.  And now, a cartoon that describes recent events in my life all too well...  urlLink http://www.boltcity.com/copper_016_fall.htm   Lunch with my dearest Allison today. Three words, kids. Honey Sesame Tofu. Unless, of course, we decide to go to Frijoles...heheheh.  xxxxxx  sleepy j. the fire drill

      It's always nice when a gallery visit goes well. It only took 30 minutes to hit the Contemporary Museum today--30 min., 6 paintings, 5 artists, 825 words, yeah, I can do this.  It's Tuesday, and Tuesday means Frazier's karaoke. I crave Frijoles food for dinner...perhaps if I finish half of the review in time, and kick my ass proper at the gym. I'm too poor to do this right now, but fuck it, cravings must be obeyed.  xoxox j.

      Remember when people actually answered the phone? I just spent ten minutes navigating the "operator" at Baltimore's Contemporary Museum, which is actually one of those annoying perky recordings that urges you to press 90 million buttons before reaching--not a real person, oh, no, that would be TOO EASY--someone's voice mail, which cheerily informs you that they'll be at the beach until August 31. My deadline is Wednesday. I don't have time for this. Argh.  In other news, MUSE is the best live band on the planet. Argue with me if you like--I won't listen, I'll only stubbornly fold my arms across my chest and stamp my feet in righteous singlemindedness. So there.  This glue stick smells like lemons.

      TODAY is one of those days where absolutely everything feels like it should have an exclamation point after it! Fire hydrant! Cinnamon scone from coffee shop! The desultory wave that the human resources lady gave me when I got to work! Work! Chickens! Caravans! Camels! I'm not wearing any socks!  Welcome to Manic-Depressive Theatre! Which is a lot like Masterpiece Theatre, only instead of some stodgy old British guy smoking a pipe, there's me, indulging in Tylenol PM tablets for sleeping and quad-shot cafe americanos for waking.  I'm just joking. Everything's pretty good. Tomorrow is the Curiosa festival, featuring the badass talents of Mogwai, Interpol, The Rapture, Cooper Temple Clause, and the almighty everloving motherfucking MUSE...oh yeah, some band called The Cure or something is also supposed to be playing. I took off work and everything, because I am a big rock geek.  I find the fountain outside my office window oddly hypnotic. It changes direction with the wind, seemingly, and induces fond memories of the time Laura and I jumped into it with all our clothes on, stoned, and had to fish out a dead sparrow that was floating around on the top.  Now I work here.  Hahaha.   xoxoxxxxxx  j.  Current Music: Still, Joy Division; Bee Thousand, Guided By Voices; In The Flat Field, Bauhaus

      Blondes or brunettes? The eternal question went unanswered yet again at 2:30 a.m. last night, as Nicole and I *simultaneously* fended off the advances of a drunk, pimply kid outside Frazier's. He really turned on the charm, too, said he'd call us in the morning and everything.  Ewww.  Prior to that, I saw Avec, Karmella's Game, and a sweet all-girl outfit from Indiana called Arcade at the T-head with the ever-fashionable Yuri. It was a really good lineup, until some metal band from Florida took the stage post-Avec and blew everyone out of the club. After seeing Dillinger and the Bronx, I've been spoiled insofar as what metal should be. For me, at best, it is a curiosity...not really music I can get next to or connect with.  My recent wave of paranoia has given way to resigned apathy. This is, in a way, healthier.  Just bought my Guided By Voices ticket.

      This week's City Paper article continues to astound and amuse...spent another hour today talking to the curator, who was so zoned on Vicodin, she could barely remember herself.  When I got back from the gallery, I accidentally hit my crazy bone on my desk--complete chaos ensued. Stars in the air, stabbing pain, blackout, crumpled in a heap on my office floor. Fainting is somewhat enjoyable, as it sets off all my adrenal glands. But now I'm all shaky.  Whee!  Avec is playing the Talking Head tonight, I'll be there, I reckon.  xoxox j-killah

      "Complete with bubbles!" if i click on this pop-up ad 3 times, i will get a spongebob squarepants screensaver "COMPLETE WITH BUBBLES!"  Though i love that phrase, i fucking hate spongebob squarepants. Ah, well.  this weekend was fairly insular and thoughtful, considering that i had an evil head cold for the first half of it. went to maryland art place to start work on this week's art review, i got to stand in a bathroom with an artist while watching a film of said artist wearing a homemade steel chastity belt equipped with a phonograph needle. in the film, he was rubbing records all over his crotch. that was quite something. he said that he has yet to show it to his children, but intends to do so when they are a bit older. i also watched a woman fling molten sugar all over a wall. these are the moments that make it all worthwhile.  I also went to the free water school show @ talking head on saturday, that was just okay. they are very good at what they do, i'm just not all that into what they do. good to see yuri & lori &amp; nicole & paul though. also good when just one rum and coke gets you buzzed. now that's what i call economy.  Sunday was spent writing a lot, reading some Irvine Welsh, and playing video games. It was nice to have some time to myself, but I crave adventure...intrigue...excess...  Give me a ring if you've got any ideas, ducks.  xoxoxo j.
