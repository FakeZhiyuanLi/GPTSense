       Well here is my  first  posting and as is to be expected it is small.  Hopefully  not an indicator of things to come.

      Pretty much sums up my state of existence right now. I am expected to protest at not having anything to do, find some meaningful pursuit, or atleast take a walk. Atleast  thats what the world wants me to do. My problem why should I do all this if I am not uncomfortable with my status. Apparently no one likes me sitting around doing nothing. Why is it that we all have a problem with people who are doing nothing. It is not that I have anarchist thoughts or am seeking new ways of making life difficult for the rest of humanity. I just want to be. All my years of education have conditioned me so much as to tell me to get up and do something. All those sayings about idle minds and devils workshops dont compel me anymore to do something to change my existence. In addition there is something more basic, more primitive in me that tells me to enjoy the way things are. that tells me  'Just Be' .    To be sure it is my safe cocooned existence that makes it possible for me to 'Just Be'.  But a little indulgence never hurt anyone.....

      Always wondered what this meant. Is it that having loved before losing makes losing any better, or that losing after loving makes loving any better, or that the experience of both love and loss is better than no experience at all. Am confused.  But I know one thing for sure. 'tis only when you lose that you realise the value of what you lost. And this is certainly true with regards to a sentiment as fine as love. A feeling that is divine and human at the same time. So much so that when you feel it, you wonder if it isn't divine that you have so much of concern and thought for another, if it isn't human that you too long for the same in equal or greater reciprocation.  .................

      Hidden deep in the dark corporate jungles are little paradises. Often times the inhabitants of these little nooks fail to realise the value of the place they are in. The kind benevolent corporate high-priests decide that a newcomer needs to be trained. Fair enough the newbie is kinda green behind the ears and needs to be seasoned before he can be sacrificed at the altar of the client.  For the lucky newbie everything falls in place. The training ends and he is onto work. ....  Woe betide the unlucky one, seems to be the refrain that you hear all around you. Insinuations of being unfit for the job, being unwanted by your boss are subtly dropped by all about you. Enough to break down a lesser mortal. But not so for those who are privileged enough to see through it.  'tis natural law that every generation must have people who are suckers in the literal sense. They live off the sweat of another's brow and the toil of another. Seems to be a calling. One that not many heed. To be a sucker you don't have to do much, infact you don't have to do anything. You are chosen for the role. But being a happy sucker, that is a tall order, To be a happy sucker what is needed is an ability to accept 'doing nothing' of significance as a daily routine. Once you do that tis bliss unlimited. Many a prospective sucker have ruined their happy existence and been cast out of their personal Edens, just because they felt that it was wrong to be 'doing nothing'.  Wrong education seems to be the reason. IMHO the day educationists decided to teach and not make the pupil learn, was the death of any useful learning.  Well not everybody succumbed to it :-)  But I don't want to be the exception    Protest I need to do and protest I shall, not in full measure but very very substantially.
