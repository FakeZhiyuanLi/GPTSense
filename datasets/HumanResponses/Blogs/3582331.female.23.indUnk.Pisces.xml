      There has been a lot on my mind lately. I am just going to type and see what comes out.   I spent a day and a half with my mom and thought I was going to go insane. It's sad how depressed and lost people are without Jesus. It's hard to be around them sometimes. I love my family more than words could express, but sometimes I just want to run far far away.   I am leaving for Texas in about 4 and a half weeks and I am getting a little overwhelmed. There is so much I need to do and figure out before I go. I don't know where I am going to stay when I get there, where I am going to work, what classes I am going to take, anything....the reality of me going just seems to be crashing down on me all at once right now and I am trying my best to give it to the Lord, trust Him and relax. It's a little challenging.   I have been feeling a desire for deeper friendships. I have a few deep friendships, but I don't get to spend as much time talking with them as I would like and I would really like to develop some other deep friendships. I just want people around me who understand me, who I can be serious with and who I can be crazy and funny with. I want balance, honesty, love, trust. So many relationships are built or "kept together" with dishonesty and deceit and it's so sad. I just want REAL people who are willing to be REAL.   I miss so many people so much it hurts. I never knew I could feel this way about friends, about people I hardly know, but wish to get to know better. I never thought it was possible to miss someone so much, even when they weren't family. In reality, they could be more family to me than my physical family because they are my spiritual family. I just want to see them again, and I will soon....for a little while. I long for that family feeling, that understanding, common faith, encouragement, love. God has blessed me with so many amazing people, I am overwhelmed by His goodness and love for me.  Okay, I think this is long enough and random enough. I love you all....if anyone even reads this.... if not, that's okay too.   SMILE :-)

      I want somone to really know me  I want to share Christ with random people  I want my family to understand me  I want all the childern in the world to have loving homes  I want every person who is new at coming to Christ to have someone to disciple them  I want families to be reunited  I want to see my dad  I want my mom to be financially okay  I want the lost to see hope in God  I want the unloved to feel loved  I want to rest in God's arms  I want to talk with my friends and say I am sorry if I have ever hurt them, to tell them I love them and to open up to them who I REALLY am.   I want to cry....cry for the hurting. The lonely, those without families, without hope, without love, those who are slowly perishing, those who are knowinlgly turning their backs on God.   I want to have arms big enough to hug all the children who have never been hugged  I want my life to make a difference in this world, not by my doing, but because I have died to myself and allowed the Lord to live in me.   I want a life that glorifies the Lord in everything I do  Is that all too much to ask......?

      You don't see pictures of the hard times in your photo albums and scrapbooks, but they are what get you from one happy picture to the next.   Don't let go....hold on to EVERY MOMENT! No matter what it "feels" like or how hard it is. They are all a part of the life that God gave us. Be blessed everyday, and if you are not blessed everyday remember that it's your fault and not His. God WANTS to bless us every single day, but it's up to us to recognize and accept the blessing. Some times the blessing come in a disguise and we think it's a curse, but we must daily trust our Father.   I thank God for so many of my unanswered prayers. My life would be so much worse off if I would have gotten it "my way"  Be blessed and smile :-)

      So life lately has been difficult and I am going to write about it. I am not going to worry about who reads this, I am not going to be fake or censor what I type today. I have had a hard week and I need to vent. If you don't want to hear real words from a real person who struggles with real things then please don't read on....  So, I am a sinner....oh my gosh...I admitted I sinned....everybody does. I have realized lately that I have a lot more sin in my life than I recognize and I am a lot more fleshly than I want to be. I also try to justify my actions WAY TOO much. I haven't spent near enough time with the Lord lately (basically none in these past few days) and it hurts my heart and I know it hurts His. I am almost ashamed to go back to Him because I feel I have so deeply neglected my One True Love. I feel emotionally drained and overwhelmed, my heart is heavy. I have been condemning myself the past week and I know most of it is a lie from the enemy and I feel ashamed that I have fallen in to his trap. I am struggle to breathe and keep from drowning in my own selfish world. I have not spent any time recently around Christians. I have been with family and friends that I love dearly and desire with all my heart for them to know the Lord, but it is a draining and spiritually drying place to be when I am with them too long.   I miss feeling the true deep sense of joy that I had at Teen Mania. I can sense and know that I have the joy of the Lord who has saved me from eternal hell, and I am thankful for that joy. But, there is a feeling of true joy, laughter, healthy happiness that I miss. I want to talk with someone...anyone who knows me....who understands me and knows and agrees with my faith in the Lord. There hasn't been anyone for a long time. I long to be held by my Father, to rest in His presence again, to cry to Him and allow Him to comfort me. Something has been keeping me from that.   Lord, help me. I am so sorry that I have hurt your heart by neglecting you. I am in pain in my heart because I am ashamed of the way I have been and I know it has not been pleasing to you. Help me run to you again, to feel welcome in your arms, I want you....I need you....I am DESPERATE FOR YOU! Please hold me. I am sorry, I am so sorry, Lord, forgive me, I am sorry.....I don't know what else to say Lord, I am so sorry, I love you so much and am sorry, I want to want you again. Help me please. I am weak, I am poor, I am so broken, but Lord I am yours....please hold me now.

      I want to curl up in the fetal position and just cry for the sake of crying.  I want to throw myself on the floor and throw a tantrum.  I want to be a kid again and climb in my mom's lap and let her rub my forehead.  The more I pay attention to myself, the more I don't understand myself.  I am being emotional today. If a guy was talking to me he would probably roll his eyes and say I am emotionally needy...that's okay, guys just don't understand girls sometimes and that is okay. We don't understand them sometimes either.   There are a few people I would REALLY love to talk to right now, I always feel good after talking to them, whether it's on IM or phone or in person. There are just those people who I REALLY enjoy talking with.

       I am just being random for the sake of being random. I am soaking wet, because some kid that I am watching spilt Apple juice on me. I am IMing with my friend Amelia in Canada....gosh I miss her. I miss a lot of people. Even those I have recently seen. I feel so blessed to have the people in my life that I do.    &nbsp;   I am posting this from email...it's really cool. I am learning lots about the computer. I hope it works.    &nbsp;   LOVE YOU ALL   SMILE  __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

       Things in my life seem to be going really well. I know what I am doing next year, I am financially okay (praise the Lord), I should be happy. For some reason I feel an overwhelming sadness right now. WHY??? I don't know. I mean, I do have the joy of the Lord and I am content with my circumstances, but there is the "emotion" of sadness lurking around me. I HATE IT! Maybe it's because what I see in sight is still too far away to reach. Maybe it's because I want to help so much, yet seem so helpless. I want the people that I love the most in my life to know the hope and joy I have in Christ. My heart breaks when I hear of hurting children, not only in the world, but right here in my home town, and there is nothing I can physically do about it. Families are broken, lives are lost....and here I sit, typing, thinking, crying....because I don't know what else to do. God is so much bigger than all of this and I have to pray and trust that His will will be done. If I dedicate each day to Him, lay down my agenda for His, I know He is faithful. The problem is, sometimes I don't lay down my agenda, sometimes I try to live this life on my own strength and still expect God's will to be done. That simply can't be. It's the daily taking up the cross, dying to ourselves and allowing God to live in us that will make the difference. So maybe this sadness is because I realize I have been trying too hard for too long to make it on my own and I realize that something has got to die....and that something, is me. It's a hard concept to think about. Dying....giving up control, being broken and weak. But it's the only way for God to truly live in you, and for Him to get all the glory He deserves. So now, I choose to die.....

      Okay, so I gave in and did the xanga thing, now I am giving in and doing the blog thing, it's the thing to do. I feel so cool! Actually I just figured this would be the place where I just vent about feelings, thoughts and "deep" stuff. Where I won't care who or if anyone reads it, I won't worry about grammer or spelling, I can just get on and vent. I am still going to do xanga (what can I say, I am addicted) but this will be more of a journal journal. So if you don't care to read it, I am fine with that. I think better when I write so this is more to help me think. We'll see how it works. :-)  Peace out Chels-dog!

      I feel very blah today. I want to cry, yet I want to laugh. I want to talk with a friend, yet I REALLY want to be silent. I don't know what to say. I miss people a lot. I love people a lot. There are people out there who don't know how much they have impacted my life. There are people out there that don't know I still think about them, care about them or that I ever did. That makes me sad. I want to have a good deep conversation with someone that isn't shallow, petty or selfish, yet I don't know what I would say if I had the opportunity.   I feel blah today!

      So lately I have been talking to and reading a lot of emails and sites from people who are thinking about, wanting, desiring or actually getting married and having babies.   It seems to be a little overwhelming, EVERYONE lately has "love" on their mind. I realize as I am writing this, that possibly I, too, have it on my mind, I just don't seem to vocalize it like a lot of people these days.   I think this is for several reasons. #1) at this point in my life, it is not an option available to me, so why dwell on it and talk about it when it's not going to happen right now? That would just be feeding my emotions. #2) I have trust issues and I am afraid to let people really know how I am feeling and what is going on in my mind. #3) I assume no one cares....  I don't know, maybe I have issues.....  I do think about getting married, what it would be like, having kids, a family, working for God together, growing old together....I guess everyone thinks about that, but for some reason I have noticed it's been vocalized a lot more lately from EVERYONE....it must be that time of year.
