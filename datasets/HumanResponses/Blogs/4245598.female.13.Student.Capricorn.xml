       lemme start by saying THE ENGLISH PAPER WAS DIFFICULT!!! it was really tough expecially vocab.Singapore has tough exams. *sigh* . I dunno wud i'll be scoring but like everyone said it's not the end of the world. it isn't the biggest test yet but it's important too BUT the biggest test is yet to come and i have to study danm hard. The composition was okay but i forgotten to write my ques. no :@!!! I also spelled 'phoebia' wrongly.lol. I spelled it as 'phobia' which one is the right one? The starting of my compo was 'it was a windy day. I could smell the salty air of the sea' is it right? I think it's right but some ppl said not. I didn't do my Math hmk during the weekends. muahaha but the teacher didn't collect the papers as the math exam is tomorrow and she wants us to revise/revice??? My whole body froze when she said she wanted to collect but then she decided not to mark. phew . I would be so dead if she did. I actually slept in class while waiting for the english exam to finish.lol.like for 10-15 mins. I opened  my eyes when i found Mdm Hindon walking.lol. Lucky for me that no one noticed i was sleeping. Guess wud? Ronald HO wrote in Hannah's book??? He wrote 'if no one wants eileen i want her.Don't tell her okay?' lol wud crap..Eileen is going to read and find out. He's really full of crap. SO I'm really scared of tomorrow.MATH!!!! suxs man. I'm actually betta in Eng. MAth is Undestructable but it can destruct me easily.Wish gd luck to my friends for 2morrow's battle ... well that's all for now. Bye!     ffO ngiS,    anaid

       well...yesterday i went to Causeway Point no big deal but my mum was at Hejab Iran for 2HOURS!!! and i have to wait for her not only that but i have eyes that will turn red if i'm in air conditioned places for too long. so i waited with teary red eyes lookin like i was crying but i wasn't. Then we went to my places after that freakin two hours so i bought floss(lol pathetic) that's all cuz this isn't a place i like to be..i rather shop at orchard road which has more stuffs than at CP. The my mum went to wtf the lucky draw and guess wud if u spend $300 u'll get $5 voucher. DUMB! DUMB! DUMB! stupid right? i don't even knw why they give ONLY a $5 voucher after spending $300 not worth it at all. My mum bought a 'jubah' from hejab iran which cost $125 ..expensive for me. i could buy some shirts frm mango or somewhere with that   money.    my STUPID sis doesn't want to tell me how do i put a song into my BLOG. I HATE YOU!!!! I'll go to ur blog and never delete it in the history folder. muahaha!!! everyone go 2   urlLink  www.norizal.blogspot.com   ... her's and her nerdy boyfriend...    sign off,   diana

       hey ppl..well today i'm totally angry with that babilah..sumethin funny happened too (hehe izyan) That BABILAH said that she's not going to school with me anymore. I was like OKAY..WTF like i really need you. i just wanted to say to her U SUX!!! for 3/4 of the year, i was the one whose always early and have to wait 15mins for her to come down!!! she thinks like she's so important and everyone has to treat her like a princess.  Your JuST A PIECE OF CRAP and every1 knws that... so i went home with ezowen and azlyn..and we went to 7-eleven cuz izyan wanted to buy something.       So she decided to buy mashed potato frm the machine..she asked me to place the cup for her cuz she's scared.lol. and the mashed potato came out i dunno. disgusting. it was all watery so we didn't knw as it was our first time and the evil cashier said that it won't be watery after some time. izyan went to the counter to pay. when she was putting the mashed potato on the counter SPLASH!!! it all fell. the cashier wiped the floor and another one came. cut short the story. the other cashier came and examined the machine and found out that the mashed potato had finished .. she added more and Izyan got her mashed potato and this time it didn't fall.lol.funny. she said it tasted delicious. right Izy???? : )                                                                                                                                                   Sign off,                                                                                                                                      Diana[the unknown]

       well another day.. today i went home quicker than usual. I'm totally busy now because I have extra lessons on Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri. I'm alwayz going home late. Me, act as a fren to Nabilah, wanted to laugh at her for being childish at an age of 12. for a lot of people the brains have started to mature but for her doesn't seem like that. She was i dunno mad at her mum or whoever in her family and she didn't even talk to anyone in sch. when she went to sch, it seems that she was crying wud a loser.    I'm not mean or anythin but *sigh* it's totally IRRITATING....worst of all when our teacher was talking about natural hair color is brown, she said hers was natural too. Oh please right....thats wud i wanted to said her natural hair color, brown makes me want to laugh and puke at the same time. She had dyed it like 4 times. plez...almost everyone hates her cause she's bossy and proud of herself. She said she's totally independent but she's not. she can't even stay at home by herself at home pathetic... and she said that she uses her own money to buy stuffs and NEVER ask her mum. like real hello there u have been spending ur MUM'S money all along.     About me now  well...hmm..i'm getting$10 a mth now which is totally pathetic..can u imagine jusT $10.....!!! well good enough rather than getting nothing. I'm SO DAMN GROUNDED!!!!!!!!!!! cuz i didn't go for my religious..i went but i was late and there was no one teaching anymore..".........." The exams is just next week!!!!! My math is still poor but eng, sci and mly are okay..Here's wud i think i'll get in my report book...  Eng A Math F/C(arg!!!!!) Science A/B (depends on the paper) Mly A  I cannot get an F..it'll look real bad. these results and important as they are the ones which show me which sch i'll be going to. BUT it's not the most important. THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PSLE (primary sch leaving examination) right sounds lame but it's totally dangerous. ARG!!!!! well i wish my frenz all the best of luck in ur exams... : ) : ( :/ :      Sign Off,    Diana[the unknown]

I repeat NOT TRUE. so i started chasing him at the forth floor corridor.

      hi everyone..right..all my frenz knw me. well first day i write here. I'm really pissed off cuz i kept forgetting my username n hav to make a new one :/..well just went back frm sch.tired.no hmk today which is good. life is difficult for me cuz my parents are police.. everyone will be saying so wud right? BUT if u live with my parents..u won't last a day. wud can i say it's fated. it's like getting grounded everyday and everything i do seems to be wrong. well at sch i found out a frend of mine was reading my book..not any book but a special one. it's not a journal or anything like that cuz those r for girls who r lonely and alone. mine is filled with songs i wrote and a long story..dunno whether my songs r good but wud u expect from a 12yrs old right? but my friends says it's good. ONLY special friends are allowed. Some ppl just can't keep their nose to themselves. lol..just now my friend told another one to piss off. the person didn't knw wud that was so she was totally puzzled. I'm goin for guitar lessons and the end of the year when my final exams r over. that the time when i'll be totally happy but the results it's scary cuz with the  results,  it determines which sch ur gonna go. If i don't get the sch i want, i will be told to go to an all girls sch.lame. there's no excitement. just imagine if u say u want to skate all the girls will be like sheesh ur a girl and u want to skate. skating are for boys. if that girl doesn't stop that instant, i will punch her face but by doing that i will get into more trouble. sigh . well life.
