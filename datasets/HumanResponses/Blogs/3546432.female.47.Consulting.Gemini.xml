						   Mirrors are meant to be fractured.   I look at my reflection and fracture it in my mind to what I wish it would be--a flat belly, a small waist. The only part of my body I wish to fracture and re-build.  Would she do that for me?  An operation to fracture and rebuild.  They are out there.  Expensive.  To fracture.  The mind is lost.  I am 47 and wish for a flat belly.  Otherwise, I am content with the reflection in the smooth looking glass.  Content....

						   and then leaving like summer sky azure. No clouds today. Only the hot breath of God making us beg for the cool rain of monsoon. When I think of sky, I think of feathers, I think of wings unfurling pale cat's paws claws retracted ready to arch and scratch at moment's notice. Give pause to this thought. Then move on.  There is nothing else.  Naught.  None  Non  no

						   Smarty, ah, my dear, what a blow to your beautiful ego--I'm sure you will still be much-loved by your folks and trainers, as well as your jockey. Smarty, I love you yet...so sad...

						   I shall print out vouchers and itineraries for the morrow. When it is five, I will turn off the computer, check out, and leave. I will drive home and I will not arrive until after six. I may or may not swim. I may or may not drink tequila. I may or may not have a heavy dinner. I may or may not visit with my friend before she leaves tomorrow for a trip. I may or may not sleep. I do not know what I may or may not do; I only do. These are my thoughts.  I am water woman, born near a river, swam in a river, but now there is not water, only desert sand and sky and it is dry and hot and I wilt under the azure sky curved like an angel's wing blanketed over her blank face that reveals nothing for she has no eyes nor mouth nor nose only a fresco of emotions that run through her veins as the dark blood runs through mine. Water. How I long for it. To drink it. To pour it over my face and my body. To splash and delight in its essence, its crystals that change under the microscope of desire and heart beatingpoundinggrinding until it one day ends with single bleep, perhaps on a screen, perhaps not.  And thatis how I will end with a single bleep on a screen, miniscule. Once here, now not here.    Gone.

						   and I am sitting here counting down to 5 p.m. I have six hours to go, and six days left to work before a weekend of freedom arrives.  Our friends leave tomorrow and will probably be back next Saturday. We are to feed their kat. They leave us a key and we are free to eat their food, drink their liquor and beer, swim in the pool, and sit in the sun.  It's a glorious life.  Thoughts run through my head today like thugs out for revenge. Azul sky (cielo) climbs like a curved wing ever-expanding, unfurling like crescent moon rising over Pichaco Peak....

						   or at least those in cooler climates might view Arizona sunshine to be paradise, but when the temps are well over 100 every day, it seems that Milton's Paradise Lost might be a more appropriate way to view the month of June in Tucson AZ. The mornings are pleasant enough--that's when I like to go to my friend's pool (on my days off, which are few these two weeks--the ole' dollar calls when bills are to be paid)--anyway, back to the pool, and lie in the sun toasting. Of course I use sunscreen--only idiots from elsewhere refuse to block their tender skin. Five minutes and sizzling may occur. Went over there last night after work and dove right in. No hesitation. 105 I believe the temp was. Had a couple of Coronas with lime, had dinner, and went home, and slept so well that I didn't want to rise an shine. And now it's Saturday and I'm at work (not a usual gig, but it's okay now and then). I will work until 5, then it's to home I go. Perhaps another dip in the pool. Who knows? But it is an hour drive...thank God I'm moving soon. Only five minutes from work then, but an hour from my friends.  So is this a boring post or what? I don't care--it's just a way to release some pent-up anxiety and boredom....  Pissed off about the war, but what to do? A little late to pull out--not another Viet Nam on our hands. Blood shed for nothing. Double-speak is what we get. And how dare our government "confuse" the plight of Afghanistan with Iraq--how dare Bush link the Taliban with Hussein...sneaky, eh? Not so much, unless you're a sheep without brains and, apparently, without wool...

						   That all I can do is sit around and type on my blog. I wonder how I can find others...like that Japanese man who became an internet wanderkind with his blogging interests and so forth....Sure like to talk to some other bloggers...Anyone interested in a dialogue about whatever????

						   Today has been a thug day, not a thought day. And now you ask, what is a thug day? It is a day in which my thoughts are scattered and non-cohesive, like rain water sheeting through a Tucson sky (usually azure). There are days when thought days are worse than thug days because thought days lead to obsessing about tomorrow, over which I no control.   And I am new at this, so revealing too much at one time is not an option.  I wonder how to read others' journals...
