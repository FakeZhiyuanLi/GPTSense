      You may well ask why.  It is interesting that to show his lover the depth of his feelings, he will give her a dozen red roses. Roses are a metaphor for love.  Their intricate beauty and delicate smell. You need to handle a petal with as much love and care as the manner and thought behind which they were purchased. One wrong move can bruise easily, unintentionally.  Kept in the right place in the right conditions a cut rose can last for a long time. Indeed some roses have been preserved forever within a vaccuum packed glass vase.  Sometimes if you move too quickly - or make a wrong move - you can be hurt until you bleed - for even the most beautiful red rose has a thorn on its stem.  Handle with Care

      Remember  How we touched and caressed How we longed for each other’s presence How we imagined what it would be like To be together for ever and always  Events that pass and take root Behaviour to be unlearned Sometimes - unavoidably The past filters through  Today is different – today a new day The dawning of life in fresh form Forget what is gone and done The morrow is dawning  Children laugh and play In the knowledge of security Protected from harm Yet we can only guide  Hard to forget at times What happened and what hurt Children forget without due thought Can I learn from them?  Loving life in all forms We love once more Fresh and new Another chance, another view  Use what has gone to fulfil And move on from before Renew ourselves and realise We are born again, revitalised  Touch again – fresh it is Still the longing, still the certainty Life changes but our Constancy can remain   Inspired by Christina Georgina Rossetti (1830 - 1894)

      Remember By Christina Rossetti  Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand, Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay. Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann'd: Only remember me; you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray. Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve: For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad.

      Hope is a thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings a tune without words And never stops at all. And sweetest, in the gale, is heard And sore must be the storm That could abash the little bird That keeps so many warm. I’ve heard it in the chilliest land And on the strangest sea Yet, never, in extremity It ask a crumb of me.  by Emily Dickinson

      I think it's hardly surprising that in today's society women feel very confused about love for their child at times, considering the lack of proper support in for a new mother - we are very much alone when we begin our new "career".  Not to mention the underlying triggers that may be lingering just beneath the surface when a new mother recalls her own childhood.  I felt very much alone when I had my first-born.  What do I do today?  Oh I know, I'll get up and manage to apply a spot of make up, and wash my hair.  Then what - feed baby for the nth time that morning... shall I go shopping?  Go to a coffee morning and meet other mothers who are also feeling like grunge in these early months.. Oh dear, baby cries again, heart-piercing cries and I feel like I want to shout and scream.  There are too many facets at stake here and I think taking it down to a reductionist perspective may be one way of looking at it in terms of a mother's love being intrinsic, but I think there's more going on.  Our culture is very confused as to what is favoured, but not loving ones child is most not "PC", so there is plenty of guilt to hand out to those who feel they don't "fit in" for various reasons, PND being one of them.  Do we favour working mothers, or are they feeling permanently guilty?  Are we supposed to stay at home, or do we feel inadequate against "earth mothers".  Can we breastfeed - if not do we feel guilty - if we breastfeed in public many don't like it, if we don't then we're not doing the best for our child.  Do we get enough support if we want to breastfeed?  Usually we either chance upon the best source of support quite by accident, other times we are left to fend for ourselves.  Some prefer to fend for themselves, and that is right for them - others need the company of others and the wisdom that has gone before to tap into and find out then what works for them.  When we look at other cultures it seems there exists a much more relaxed attitude towards child rearing and the extended family - but far be it for me to generalise.  There are some cultures who want to raise fiercely independent children who are able to fight.  There are others who thrive on peace and family connections.  Yet more raise children to be able to kill for food.  No wonder many of us are confused!  Kate - 17 August 2004

      DADDY’S GOT A NEW CAR  A phone call from Hamburg:  “I’ve got my new car – it’s really great. It’s got programmable seat positions, a tiptronic gear box and a CD that gives you directions!”  So Daddy’s got a new car. It is green, with leather seats to match. The driver’s seat has three programmable seat positions, so that the driver can select position number one, and other “named” drivers can select positions two and three. If driver number two comes along and wants to drive the car, he or she simply steps in and keys in number 2. The seat automatically shifts into the relevant position, as do the wing mirrors. One almost expects it to leap into action with “Your morning paper, sir…”  “I want to go for a ride in your new car, Daddy!” came the chirrups of daughter number one, as soon as Dad had arrived home from picking up his new Audi A6 in pristine condition, all the way from Hamburg.  “Girls! Be careful of the seats! I don’t want any sticky marks on this car like on the other car!” “Careful opening the door, don’t scratch the paintwork!”  So off we went for a drive to Cirencester. We programmed in our destination to the CD and it began speaking in womanly dulcet tones to us. At last a female that knows where she is going….  “Road is being calculated…..” “Proceed along the road for 4 miles. Continue until further instructions.” “Turn right at next junction.”  We proceeded to turn left, believing the instructions to be incorrect.  “Make a U-turn if possible and take next left”…  We ignored the instructions again, went past a different turning and the CD began re-assess and then came out with:  “Proceed until the next roundabout and take the third exit.” A small diagram on the dashboard shows the approach to the roundabout, and the turnoff to take.  Unfortunately, after half an hour of sitting in this car all the way to Cirencester, purely for the joy, you understand, of riding in Daddy’s new car.. and my mind began to wander. The CD’s instructions took on a mind of their own:  “Proceed along the road until you hit the next lamppost…” “Please avoid crashing into the car in front… take the next turning and drive into the lake…” “I’m a woman. NEVER underestimate the power of a woman or else I’ll lead you up the garden path” “Next time you refuse to follow my instructions correctly I shall auto-destruct within five seconds” “No one is watching you right now, you may pick your nose…”  At last a female that will never leave her man, at least not while he’s driving…  Isn’t it wonderful, all this new modern technology? I enquired as to whether or not the windscreen wipers on the car were automatic, i.e. switching on at the first drop of rain. My husband sounded quite sad that in fact, no, they weren’t – but his colleague’s were! He’s got a new Mercedes….  Oh, and the best thing of all for us practical peeps? It has cup holders for drinks!

      Musings on Motherhood &amp; Marriage  Having children was the best thing that ever happened to me, but alongside with that was the deterioration of our marriage, perhaps not as strong as we first thought. We had totally different ideas which meant I didn't feel as "free" to enjoy the children as I would have liked.  Having your own child is a seriously wonderful experience - egotistical and perhaps even a selfish desire, yet you do have to give up your own life to a degree in order to put them first for a while...... although not necessarily to the exclusion of all else. Their needs are biggest in the first five years. People that say "always put your husband / wife" first I think are missing the point of parenthood. Maybe put them first emotionally in your heart but the children's basic physiological needs need to come first in the early years because they don't really understand otherwise. And your partner is quite capable of looking after himself! But I digress. Read on.  Thinking of your partner and keeping the bond alive is vital - once the children have flown the nest, there are just the two of you once more, so you need to have built some bridges along the path of parenthood. But this isn't straightforward and often there is a constant juggling act that takes place - especially on the part of the parent who may elect to stay home with the children for the first few years of their lives.  Be unprepared for totally unconditional love for your children that you might think you have now but you know it is a totally different love with your partner...  The most important thing about having children is that the man understands his partner sufficiently enough to cope with the hormones changes etc., and not demand her to do anything she isn't ready to do. The woman on the other hand needs to understand that she isn't the only one with hormones and feelings in all of this but that is the hardest part, because her emotions are crying out for her children, motherhood etc.... that is the biggest thing in her life once a child comes along. It becomes very easy to shut the man out with all this going on in the background, and many men find this exceptionally hard to deal with.  Having children is wonderful and can be a very unifying experience between the "right" people!  Oh, and there's nothing to beat the smell of your own baby's head when they are all tucked up in their beds, fast asleep.......
