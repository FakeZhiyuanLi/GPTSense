      Everything is going better now.  Gaby came home yesterday and I'm glad because he's part of the reason that stuff is better with me and Mikey. We went to his house last night and just being with him like I was made everything feel better like we had started over fresh. There wasnt any pressure it was just us watching a movie. It felt really good.  I really hope that Jonah can help us out. I'm not sure how thats going to work out though. Oh well.... it will definately be an interesting night Wednesday.

      Why do I have to be as forgiving as I am?? Last night I was seriously considering ending things with Mikey but i didnt. I talked to "Jonah" forever about what was happening between Mikey and I and was so aggravated that I felt like I was going to pass out.When Mikey tried to talk to me I had to walk away so I didnt hit him. He got frustrated with me so he went and talked with Jonah. I'm not exactly sure what was said there but whatever it was sure made Mikey think about what he's been doing to me. He apologized soooooo much and said Jonah was going to help him change. When I took him home we talked until 12:48 then he called me at 1:00 and talked until 2:30. I told him things had to change if we were going to stay together. So as of right now we are still together.  If you haven't already figured out what happened last night it had a lot to do with "Cinderella" the girl who is constantly with Mikey. I think they maybe spent a total of a hour seperated before he came to talk to me at 10:30ish.  Another thing that happened last night was Sherri. She was questioned about being drunk because she passed out after going on 3 rides. Me and Shane were walking thru the fair holding her up incase she passed out agian  with Brian walking behind us. A security guard stopped us and told Sherri to get on the cart thing because she was "drunk" and I told him where we were going and she hadn't had ANYTHING to drink that night. Brian stayed and talked with him as we walked Sherri back to the tent with everybody else. Apparently the cop person told him that we could get arrested or something for lying to him about Sherri if he found out differently.  I used to dislike Sherri with a passion but after last night I definately like her. I asked her opinion about the Mikey thing and she wouldnt give it to me because it was her brother. Thats not the only reason I've started liking her but it sure is one of them.
