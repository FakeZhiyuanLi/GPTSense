      Today we had combined activity.  Just the usual stuff (PT, playing games) but now with 02 scouts too.  Then there's something different.  Our science teacher, Mr Law Hock Ling, could actually  dance. ( btw, he's the head of the 02 scouts)    Trust me, I am not lying, Gabriel and Chin Yang saw him too.  He danced one song for an entire 6 mins (not funk dance, but live dance, well, pretty good anyway)  And that's our science teacher.  Cool.  The rest of the activity sux.  Cos it was pouring.  When we were playin' b-ball, it was like everyone was falling and the ball kept rollin' out of the court.  Some 02 sec 3s, like Cheng Zheng (or I think that's what he's called) were really rough.  Cheng Zheng created 2 long scratch marks on Nicholas Ong's face. When I say long, I say10 cm+  Talk about a  cat fight, lol.  Nic. Ong hasn't looked at himself in the mirror yet. Well, he should get quite a shock.

      Aww... man... we have to go and cheer our track team in the national stadium on Wednesday.  Well, we could see tons of supporters, all from different schools. Then, the most horrid thing of all (it rained) Well, I didn't have an umbrella, so guess what happened. Then when it was all bright and shine, we went out. 20 mins later, it rained again.  Well now, isn't the sky smirking at us or something? The next time we went out again, the seats were all dripping wet, and the stadium seats are cleaned like once in a lifetime??? So the water soaked up all the dust and the crap on the seats and cloth sucks up water, see??? So when everyone sat down, our trousers became black.  Anyway, the main thing is that I wanted to get home at 7pm for dinnertime. And by the looks of it, the whole thing is most probably going to end at 7:30 (not to mention the long queue for the bus to get to the MRT and the mass scramble to get ppl out of the stadium) So, me and Nelson tried to erm... sneak off.  Thrice.  First time: We told the rest of the ppl that we were going to da loo. Then we met Aaron Tan and co. from 2L. Anyway, they were also keen on zao- ing too. So me and Nel went to the toilet and we agreed that we should try and zao. So, then we came out of the toilet, ready to walk out of the stadium with the 2L dudes when this prefect happened to be walking past. Then Aaron said loudly (oblivious to the fact that the prefect was a feet away) "Nelson, are you zao-ing? You want to follow us???"  In front of the prefect.  How stupid can one get?  Then Nelson replied (loudly) "Like that how to zao??? YOu want to zao you all zao lor! We are loyal to the school and there are so many ppl around, we can't possibly zao and we don't want to lah!"  Smart.  The perfect move to do when a prefect is adjacent to us.  So we flunked our first try (thanks to Aaron)  Thenwe headed upwards, back to the seats. And then ho ho! We saw Christian and his father! So, we went up to them and said "Uncle, can we take a lift to Kallang MRT???"  So we followed Christian.  Out of the entrance to the seats.  But not out of the stadium.  Anyway, the stadium has four gates. We went for one of them. Then... how unlucky can you get???  FOUR teachers from RI and a handful of prefects were standing there. What to do now??? Zao (as in back to the seats lah!) Christian has the excuse that his father had already arrived but the prob. is that Chris's dad ain't our dad. LOL.  So, dejected, we went back to the seats.  And we saw all our form teachers there, lol.  Then I came up with a stupid, childish plan: (to Nel) "I tell you what, I take your bottle, u chase after me, we run outta the gates"   Hey man! That  stupid, childish  plan worked!!!   Thats REALLY the surprise of the century!!!  The good thing is, some schools (not ours) were leaving, so we mingled with the crowd to get outta the get unnoticed  The bad news is, now that we are out of the gate, then what??? None of us know the way well.  So we just followed some ppl out of the stadium, then Nelson was trying to be the tracker (well, he visited the stadium more than me) So, we walked, walked, walked and got lost.  Until we meet this construction uncle.  So we asked him where Kallang MRT was. He said "wah! Kallang MRT very far u know..."  Anyway, he did point out the direction for us.  Needless to say, we were covering our badges. I was folding my arms and Nel was slinging his bag strap over the badge.  So we managed to get to the MRT and go home.  NEXT DAY: Hi Justin! How was the track thingy? What time did you get home?  btw, he got home at 8:20. LOL  WE got home at 7.    &nbsp;

      Just watched an interesting documentary today.  Nothing much in AXN or Star World to look at, neither in the sportz channels as well, so I flipped to National Geographic.  The documentary mentioned about UFOs. They said that all UFO sightings were actually hot air balloons that were seen at different angles, hence the misconception.  They also proved it with a handful of scientists and researchers.  So now they are saying that all our idea of UFOs, aliens and spacecraft are actually balloons.  What an anticlimax...&nbsp;

      &nbsp; Right, these few days, a lotta ppl from our class are getting troubed.  Cos the teachers used OUR class for the sec 4s learning and discussion. And so... those ppl (like me) who like to hag around in class after school have to go home. Sad case...  Then the sec 4s started doing some funky stuff.  Like drawing manga on our notice board.  Funky.  But good for us. (really)  Know why? Cos I took out my handphone and took the pictures of some paper bits left by a broken hole puncher on the ground, a dirty, wet, grimy and stinky PE shirt left over by some funky sec 4, a plastic bag with a "7 eleven" on it, and previously, we found some can drinks, twisties and raisin packets left hanging around (not to mention a whole lotta comic drawing on the sideboard.  Sounds pretty bad huh? Anyway, I handed my handphone for the teachers to admire at (not my handphone, the pictures!!!)  Then our Head of Pupil Welfare Department Lim Jee Nee got angry and said 'Either they'll have to comply or they will be banned for using the classroom'  So I went back to the classroom and told everyone about the erm... good news.  Yay! Freedom to use the classroom for ourselves again for the afternoon!

      You know, I like swimming and hate it at the same time.   Like: Basically, I like swimming as a sport, as a recreation, as water polo.  Hate: My swimming training every sunday.  It ain't no joke being someone who is at lifesaving level and who has&nbsp;finished all survival swimming corses and achieved a gold star.   Cos for every lap that we do below expectations :20 pushups.  And our coach's expectations are WAY HIGH!!!   And then again, we big boys are the ppl doing da dirty job. Dunno what this means???   Our coach chose two girls to compete with each other (as in the two youngest and slowest)  Then if girl A comes in last, we do 10 pushups. If girl B comes in last, we do 10 pushups.   This is a pretty good strategy as the girls would feel guilty if they made ppl do pushups and would definitely work harder.   But then again, what about us??? We swam a total of 30 laps+   30X10 + (approz 10 laps unsatisfactory)X20 = ??? (fill in the blanks)   LOL.   My arms were aching for the next 3 days.   And the best thing is, every lesson we focus on something. Eg. this week we did front crawl.   And next week is butterfly (ie. 1:30 hours of butterfly training all the way)   How 'bout that???   Cool huh?

      Lol, ppl in class are having fun with our bio lesson in yeast production.   Well, first, they mmade the bread dough into many different shapes and sizes (actually, most just shape their dough into balls)   Then, we were supposed to keep the dough to see the difference between those that we put yeast in and those that were the controls.   Then, after bio lesson, ppl kept the dough to bring home.   Then, actually, no one brought the dough home cos ppl started PLAYING with the dough. They started making some curry puffs with the dough and some other pastries.   Worse of all was, dough is sticky when mixed in water, right???   Ppl in class were throwing dough around. These dough started collecting dust and all (talk about Singapore's humidity)   And the funkiest part was: they added water then throw it against the wall. Understand???   So anyway, 5 days later, we can still see two dough balls sticking onto the wall. No doubt nobody wants to go up there to get the shat down (oh, by the way, in open air, bread lasts for a short while, so those two balls of... stuff were attacked by fungi)   Talk about us being RI kids.   (I wonder which smart guy added dough with water in the first place)   And Sheng Hao (who happens to post a comment here) I was lubbing the dough at Zei cos he lubbed the stuff on me lol =P

      Ah well.. the 02 scouts campfire sux like shat...   It was just some playin of songs, dancing around and being out of your mind   Really.   Anyway, I personally feel that our scout group's campfire was much better than that of 02.   I was funk dancing all the way in front in EVERY song until all the other scouts from my batch asked me why do I like brake dancing and must I do that all the time, lol   Some girlz were looking and they said 'wow'   But then again, I can never match up to any of the sec 3 funkers. Maybe I need more practice.

      Just watched Spiderman 2 today. It rox (but not as good as the LOTR trilogy though). Dr Oct. looked kinda cool with his thundering metallic arms and the claw contraption at the end of each limb. Our dear Spidey wanted to quit. Aww... how sad... but then he decided to go back to being spiderman again. I wonder why they didn't throw the dumbed spiderman costume. By rights it should stink since its in with the trash right??? Maybe they were thinking that it could be used for some historic representation or something. "Shirt of Spiderman, Man who caused New York crime rates to go down by 75%" I wonder whether they should scribble this on the back of the web costume.   Well... this movie can certainly pump adrenaline in ye! Two negative points   -(regarding to movie) Dr oct was a wee bit to flabby  -(not regarding the movie) I was shivering in the cinema! I didn't bring a jacket!!!   Anyway, one movie I would most certainly recommend, with T-rrific graphics and all. 4.5/5, I am not like the newspaper person who rated it 5/5. Am I strict???

      Everyone in class goes crazy about the tennis ball. It is our most treasured possession. Losing it would be the greatest loss in the history of our class. It can be used to play throwing games, softball, baseball, soccer (including penalty shootouts. Trust me, but a tennis ball can be used for some hardcore soccer too!) and so on. Talk about losing it, it is worrying that a thief could come along and take it away.  Just like what he did to Jun Wei's $$$.  Last few days was real scary. People's wallets were lost, handphones stolen. This not only applies to our class but to other GEP classes as well (talk about our school being the top in Singapore) Even students from 2L reported losses. Personally, I lost some money as well, $2 actually. Not much, but then...  Anyway, the $2 was lost to Nelson (haha tricked you) not the thief. I betted on Greece losing against Czech (and I lost a dollar) then on Portugal taking the Euro cup (which it didn't) Talk about being unlucky!!! At least I lost $2 and not $5 in each of both rounds (poor Joel)  We were ordered by the prefects to tip our bags over. Looks like matters got worse from the the thief (let's call this dude X) X took away another 2 handphones from 2 pupils. Our teachers found out a few things about X.  1) X always lurks into classrooms when pupils have gone for Physical Education or other outside lessons (eg. Computer)  2) X is not from our class.  3) X likes writing vulgarities (a note with an F*** was found)  4) X searches almost every bag for his prizes.  Right. So we were also ordered to open our lockers after our bags. Yip Hei opened his locker, and then we found out why his name was 'Lubberman' (no, don't get me wrong, he wasn't a thief). Inside his locker was this Milo tin (from Scouts) It was meant to be shared by everyone in scouts during breakfast, but Lubberman 'lubbed' it and put it in his locker. Only his patrol members knew where it is (and so, obviously, they must have some delicious hot beverages during breakfast with no one knowing where they come from) Royce the prefect/scout was laughing so hard... looks like the mystery of the Milo tin is now solved.  You know how the name Lubberman was first created??? This Yip Hei, during the night of the group reunion, he took the opportunity that the dinner was a buffet and went to grab some mango pudding and slip them into his pocket. When he arrived at our diner table, we asked him why he only took one mango pudding on his hand, whereas everyone else took 2. So, what he did was, he took about 5 from his right pocket, then took the same number from the left. 11 pudding containers were left as the remains of his great pudding feast. And guess what? He went for a second serving of food (and returned with mango puddings that increased the total of the containers to 28!!!) Well, he ate 75 % of it, that means 21 mango puddings (estimated) Then we stacked up the pudding containers and it made this towering structure with 4 columns of 7 containers (actually, we did that as we wanted to attract attention from the seniors as we wanted lubberman to be in deep shit from his table manners).  Hail to the new English relief teacher! He forgot that it was his lesson and left us enjoying the free peiod in the class.  Adios...

      Ga!!! I feel so shag now, I've never ran so fast before, and I have never ran TWO consequetive events before as well.  I was the best shortputter in our patrol, and discus thrower, so my hands felt pretty weird after the shortput throw... (surprisingly, the shortput was only 4 kg)  Then I have a hell of running events coming up!!! I have to run 1.6km long D, and immediately after that, 400m. IMMEDIATELY. What the heck. I have just broken my 1.6 record (now its 6 mins and 46 secs), need to recover for 10 mins, and 5 mins after I barely rested, I have to run 400m. Surprisingly, I got 2nd place for 400m. Weird huh??? The top two runners (including me) hadpreviously ran 1600m. Ironic, cos we were supposed to be spent while the others were fresh, but somehow I managed to ruck the 2nd place...  Btw, my previous 1.6km timing was 7.13 mins. Thats a heck of an improvement (considering that my previous record was only 2 months back.  And I have 2 relays next weeks. Rox right??? I think my legs are gonna ache tomorrow...  Hurray for Youth Day for giving us an extra day off!!!

      First time I created a blog here. This is the very first entry I am puttin' in.  Everyone shouts hurray- the stupid Mockingbird analysis is finished at last!!! Even better, it was finished just when the bell rang!!! These few months Selvan's been dismissing us for recess ON TIME!!! I think that it was a good idea for her to become a year head as she now understands the anguish and hunger of pupils when she eats into recess.  That Jun Ren is seriously crap. When Mr Teo asked everyone the maths question, he kees saying he understands it and he "knew it all along". When Mr Teo then asked us whats the next step, everyone answered in unison, "Ask Junren". Jun Ren said, "Then solve the thing". Then we all said, "How to solve the thing???" He said, "Just solve it!!!". He is seriously crappy. He and Jun Wei, this funny little duo. Lucky Wen Tao is not following their footsteps or the entire class would be convulsed in laughter. I think we are going to die of laughter sooner or later.  I am seriously stressed out by work now... wonder why I am writing this blog in the first place. I have been sleeping at eleven -something for the past few days.  And another thing, please Lord, please let Denise go for replacement class this Wednesday. I haven't got the chance to really know her yet.  I really wish that we can rewind back to the holidays. Its so much fun going to America. The food portions are so big there compared to Singapore. The coca-cola's free flow too. Thats where we get cunning... we order a cup of coke then share it among 5 people. Hey! Its free-flow right??? :P  We went to see the giant sequoias at Yosemite. When they say giant, they are really giant. When you stand at the bottom of the tree and look up, you can't see the top. No, really, you have to stand like a hundred feet away before you can really see the crown of the tree. When I extend my arms wide, it didn't reach either side of the tree. Mind you, at 1.71cm my arm span is no pushver, but this tree's so humungous that I think a car can really drive through it. What the ppl say about it is true! It really is!!!  At Yosemite, the worst part was when we came upon this scenery. There was a crytal clear lake, mountains, forest, snow on the summit and so on. That was when our Cannon digital photos ran outta battery. This sux right???  Probably the best thing in America was the Playstation 2 that my brother-in-law lent me in my sis's house. I played this game; its called Ace Combat 04. It is a flight sim game. It rox okay!!! It rox so much I actually persevered and completed the entire game throughout my stay in the US. The game graphics are the coolest I have ever seen in a flight sim (And mind you, I am no stranger to flight sims). You can go up to 15000 feet and start to dive down. At 10000 feet, the graphics are hot!!! The landscaping is precise and detailed, and the sky is so realistic you'll think its really shot by a cam. As you accelerate downwards, at 5000 feet, the graphics are STILL hot. Now this is rare for a flight sim. In most of these, the ground starts looking pixeled even vefore you hit 5000 feet. At 1000 feet, the graphic is STILL detailed. This rox right??? If you are homing on a tank, you can see the features such as the gun, the main turret, the armour, the colour and all. Then after that??? You crash. What else can you expect from someone swooping vertically downwards at 700 miles per hour??? I know this is very stupid, but I always to that to flight sims to see how good the graphics are. Then I'll start to get serious after I continue after the crash.  The sound rox too!!! THis is the only flight sim that has a song that absorbs you so much into the game you'll have the rhythm of it pumping through your veins as you fire 2 missiles at the enemy bandits. The storyline rox so much, it keeps me pressing 'continue' for dozens of times in the entire 18 levels. The story has hand-drawn images, is beautifully constructed and is very touching. Originally, you would wonder who is the persona in the story speaking to you. Is it the pilot you are playing when he was young? Or is it his relative or friend? Or is he someone else? The story then begans to unfold. The missions you complete at the same time changes the plot. It is weird that the person you are playing, codename Mobius One, is a nameless, faceless person. I can tell the basic plot, it goes like this:  The story starts with this town, where war does not affect it, and the town is oblivious to what would happen the next few months. A boy is taking his bike out for a ride down the hils. As he returned home, he witnessed this two planes in a dogfight. The two fighters engaged furiously until one was shot down. The remnants of the destroyed aircraft fell... onto the boy's home. The result was this smouldering mass of debris. The boy looked up and saw that the victor's planes nose was yellow, and it had 13 on its tail. Yellow 13 was not the plane this boy was going to forget.  War began. Everywhere in the cities, chaos was found. Cars were destroyed and roads wa unusable. People were reduced to primitive transport. Horses and carts were seen around. And everywhere people held hopes that this war could end quickly...   This boy was sent to his uncle, who was supposed to 'take care' of him. However, his uncle is an alcohol addict, hence, the boy has to make a living for both of them. His uncle always goes to the bar, so the little boy tags behind. This goes on for a few days until one day, a group of men silenced the crowd. They were the pride of the enemy forces. They were the pilots.   A score sheet was recorded for all fighters, and those who shot down five planes was called an Ace. The highest score was 64 (if I remember correctly) All men looked at this man sitting in the corner. He was playing his guitar quietly, seemingly unnoticing the commotion about him. He asked the boy to sit beside him and play his mouth organ with him. The boy played. He had found 'him'. The pride of the Air Force. Yellow 13. Ironically, the song he played was the boy's father's favourite one, one that he would play every night.   Yellow 13's wingman said that she would not allow anyone to touch Yellow 13, even if he were to be on land. In the air, the boy could see how good Yellow 13's flying was. Yellow 13 always chose to fly in a squadron of five. He always make the sharp turns and only his drew sharp contrails. His wingman said that he was a very kind man who felt sorry for all that he shot down. He prided himself not on how many kills he earned, but on the fact that no one was shot in his squad.  The incomplete highway near the boy's house used to be silent. Now it was filled with activity, for it was the squadron's runway, and the uncomplete tunnel the plane bunker. There was an asteroid-shooting contraption that was deployed to protect the earth from asteroids. Now, it was used as the primary weapon of war.   Somehow, the boy's uncle disppeared, never to be seen again. It was not known what had cause his disappearance. The boy now lived with the Yellow Squadron, the most skilled squadron of all (remember Yellow 13???) The bartender was despised by everyone in town for he was letting the enemy patronise his bar. Secretly, he and his daughter were spies for the ISAF (the Allies) They opened the bar for the enemy in hope that they could receive secrets about the enemy plans. They were the real heros, the boy thought. Yellow thirteen and his squad were not. And yet he was living with his enemy day and night...  One night, the boy went to the bar. He found the barkeeper and his daughter staring over the computer screen. They were actually collaborating information to pass to the ISAF command centre. The barkeeper caught the boy and wanted to kill him. His daughter begged him not to do so, but this was only because of the boy's tender age...  The barkeeper's daughter insisted that she hated the enemy (Erusian) pilots and would do whatever she could to stop them. However, the boy could see that she was not telling the truth (Hey, for a boy, this dude's pretty mature!!! Theme of Apperance vs Reality) Secretly, she was in love with Yellow 13. She was exceedingly jealous of Yellow 4, Yellow 13's wingman, as she was with him all day. Yet all she could do was to wait, wait and wait for his love that can never be.  Over the next few weeks, bombs and ammunition was being sent over for war. This meant that the ISAF was attacking. War was lurking closer to the city (called San Salvanon) Yellow 4, Yellow 13's wingman, was the only female in the enitre squad. Her plane was damaged and short of ammunition. However, she took of, in hopes of distracting the enemy from their objective. She never came back. (Mobius One, that is the guy you are playing, shot her down. You'll see when you play. Btw, its a PS2 game)  The Yellow squadron was distraught. Yellow 1 did not seem agitated, however. THe boy talked to him and asked didn't you miss her??? He said that he took her into his squad as she had great potential as a flyer. It was the responsibility of the pilot to take care of his plane. She did not. He recalled of her training when she was barely an adult. The boy thought, he did not seem to talk to him, he seemed to be convulsed in his own thoughts. In his hands was this scented hankerchief, Yellow 4's one.  The Stonehenge was destroyed (a circle of 6 guns that caused the death of many ISAF pilots. Needless to say, this irritating weapon was destroyed by you, Mobius One). There was a headline regarding this incident. Yellow 3 said, "Look. Here's a fighter who deserves praise. This shows that not all enemy pilots are cowardly fighters."   One night, the barkeeper's daughter sneak out to bomb an enemy runway for the ISAF. She had done these sabotage missions several times, so this wasn't her first time. She walked stealthily. Walk walk walk, walk walk walk...until she was caught be someone. It was Yellow 13. He couldn't believe that someone who was so close to him could be the person behind this. He pushed her against the wall, then I forgot what he said (no, don't get me wrong, he didn't do anything to her, he just said something), but anyway, the boy came out and said, "Get out of our country! You (I forgot)". Yellow 13 said, "do you really hate us that much. At that point of time, both the boy and the barkeeper's daughter didn't know what to say.  Cheers went throughtout the city. The ISAF had driven the Erusian fighters from San Salvanon, and the squadron made a hasty retreat. The highway was suddenly empty. The boy and the barkeeper's daughter followed the Squadron to the next place, where there was the last ground and air battle before the Erusians lost the war.  Yellow Thirteen was shot down. Him and the other 4 fighters of his squad (Yellow 4 was replaced. Our dear 13 always flew in a 5 plane combo. Guess who shot him down??? Mobius One/ You) The two Salvanon people found a fluttering hankerchief fluttering down from where Yellow 13 was last hit. It was a scented one, Yellow 4's. The boy and the barkeeper's daughter buried the handkerchief. Both were unsure of whose grave was that, Yellow 4's or 13's. Both had mixed feelings about their deaths.  After the war, the once familiar smell of petrol and gas was gone, replaced by horning cars and other vehicles. The boy knew who the hero was (Mobius One) and wanted to write to him about his life in the war, of Yellow 13 and his squad. "Yellow 13 must have been elated to meet such a good fighter like you (Mobius One) before he died... I wanted to write this letter to tell you of Yellow 13 and of his squad. And so, I write to you."  ---------------------------THE END--------------------------------  The story rox right??? Its the best a flight sim can ever have, and I am telling you, I am really lookin forward to Ace Combat 05 coming soon. I also wanna mention that the last mission's music and opening was real cool, too. "Amidst the blue skies, a link from the past to the future, the sheltering wings of a protector."   Whats nice about this game too is that there are 18 aircraft to choose from and buy. 18!!! Thats a hell lotta planes!!! Anyway, you can't use the best at the start, you only get to unlock a few everytime you complete a mission.  There is weather and all in the game, which adds realism. Whats nicest is that in the intercom, people would shout "Fox 2, Fox 2" or "Mobius One shot 1 down!!!" or when the enemy know your power "Oh no! That ribbon insigna! Its the Grim Reaper!!!" Its real nice to hear some praise when you shot down a target. I really appreciate that.  Thats it, gotta end now, have a ton of homework, I am tellin you!

      Home's a great place with an MP3 player, a TV, a com. and other great stuff.  Especially TV.  Man I luv weekends bcos of that.  Fri: Animal faceoff. Yay. My fav. documentary. And there's also 7 days on 7.  Sat: I can watch the Chinese show the Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre. I remember watching the movie part of this series for 4 times in Malaysia in ONE week: Once in a hotel, twice in a bus, once in the airplane. Cool.  Sun: The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Sabre casts again on Sun. There is only one prob. though. Amazing race 5 on AXN clashes with it on the same time. What a pity. Two great shows at the same time. Why!? Anyway, I still can't decided which to put more priority in.  And we had Scouts on Sat.  Anyway, this week's activity was FAS = Fearless Amazing Survivor. SOme shag stuff. One of the events is that u have 5+ mins to go find as much shag stuff as possible and lub it into a pail of water.  My patrol lubbed some curry into the water, added lotsa mud, added some dust from a shag rope, added lotsa twigs, leaves, some bandung, some aloe vera green tea, added strawberry milkshake, added pepper, added spagetti sauce etc.  The other patrol was more cunning. They went to the rubbish bin to get a decaying packet of rice, and they poured all the rice and carrots and brinjal and chicken bones into their pail.  I remember another patrol telling me that they scraped off some red ants from the wall and put them in their pail.  Anyway, after that 5 mins, we are supposed to take our pail and lub the other patrol. May the patrol which cause the most shirt damage to the other patrol win.  LOL.  Right, so many of us wanted to go to the toilet then. Lol.  Anyway, we secretly told the other patrol to miss us and us missing the other patrol. So (yay) we didn't get our shirts dirty. Phew for us but anticlimax to the J1s that were watching the 'fun'.  Right, I know I like happy tree friends, but we didn't have to be so sadistic in real life right???  So another activity was, erm... stare into each others eyes for 5 mins. Gay shit.  Our PL caused us to waste a lotta time as he kept laughing (btw u were not suppose to fidget)  And after a few more activities we had Vertical Challenge. Right, so the J1 asked us, "Which one is the tallest HDB flat u can see from RI???" Then we knew what was next.  Running up the stairs of a 25 storey building as fast of possible.  Erm... *yay*???

      Yeah man, tuesday rox.  Me, Nelson, Raphael and Jiapala Ling went to have lunch in Seoul Garden as Nel has a coupon BUY 3 GET A 4TH FREE, as in the 4th person's share would be free.  As students, we also get a discount.  So in all, with an ordered free flow drink, we spent approx. $40 altogether (divided by 4 = $10 per head)  And so, we went there at 11.30. I stayed till 2.30. Nel and the rest stayed till 3 or 4, I forgot.  Anyway, for the free flow drinks, we shared it. each person approx went for two rounds of drinks. 2X4= 8 times refilling.  A normal can of coke costs 1.50 right???  1.50 X 8 = X (whereby X is a hell lot lower than actual cost)  So we got profit.  And we took at least 8 full plates of stuff to barbecue, and we ate and ate and ate.  And we took some more.  And we took more.  And more.  And more.  Its good being a teen. For one thing some of us can stuff ourselves up a lot due to high metabolism rate. For another thing, it comes in cheaper for students.  One of the cheapest and most profitable buffets that I ever had.  LOL.  And on Weds, during Geog, Jun Ren, the usual cock-up guy, said he knew how to translate Jap. to English as he had been to Japan b4 (its a lie!) So our geog teacher asked him to translate to Yoshio (the exchange student) what is 'I have been to Japan before'.  So, he said, "Watashiwa...  .........  .........  ... go to Japan."  LOL.  Everyone laughed.  So he didn't know what to say and asked me for help. I told him to say, "Watashiwa wu so des"  I said 'wu' meant go, 'so' means Japan, and 'des' is how u end it.  So he said, "Watashiwa wu so des"  Actually, it means "I am lying".  LOL.

      Yeah man, got a new MP3 player today.  The usual price was $339 but then today is nat. day, so the discounted price is $188.  Cool.  So I got it.  Its some 256 megabyte thingy.  Saw Jared's blog again, looked at his hate list, whew, lucky I am not inside (I wasn't expecting to get in in the first place) anyway, saw Chester, Joel, Yip Hei, Si Hao and so on in his hate list. Maybe I should have one.  HATE LIST: (GRR... TO ALL THESE PPL WHO I HATE-BE READY TO DIE!!!) (a)-none (b)-none (c)-none  Lol, nobody's gonna die, cos I hate nobody yet lol  Looks like I gotta start hatin' ppl, even cute little Jared is starting to hate lol.

      Alas, swimming today again. But against all odds, it didn't suck.  It rocked!!!  We did butterfly ONE BY ONE!!!  And there were abt 20 ppl in our class so 1 min X 20 = 20mins slack time before my turn.  Luckily we focused more on style than stroke.  Anyway, I got caught up more on AXN and the documentaries channel this week.  AXN has nice anime (as in used to have, now Ranma 1/2 has repeated itself for dunno how many times), it has '24 '(a very nice series about a guy who has 24 hours to complete his mission, and an hour is an episode), it has '7 days' (cool time travel series that really kicks ass) and of course it has the usual Fear Factor, World Rally Championships, Now See This, Maximum Exposure and Amazing Race 5 (yahoo, go go Collin and Christie, go go Brandon and Nicole, down with Mirna but not Charla, Mirna sux) I wish the military dad and daughter didn't hafta go out though, they were very pumped up in the race, they almost caught up with Marshall and Lance even when they were way back from the flight time.  Ah... I can't decide which is better, Discovery channel or Nat. Geographic. Nat. Geographic has a cool 'Weird Nature', really sucks u up into da tv, and it has Built for the Kill, real cool anyway. However, Discovery is always game, I used to like the past series 'The Future Is Wild', a must-watch documentary, and now it has 'Animal Faceoff', great for all die-hard animal fighting fans (like me). There's all sorts of predator vs predator shows (eg. tiger vs lion, croc vs shark) and it really blows the day up! THe machines used stimulate virtual fight scenes are wow... huge mechanical giants. Here's whats the result of different animals against each other (I actually got so interested I went to its offical site)  Lion vs Tiger- Lion wins. Elephant vs Rhino- the elephant kicks ass. Wolf vs Cougar- this time, the dog loses to the cat. Hippo. vs bull shark- who would have ever thought the 'thirsty hippo' mascot could win? it did! Saltwater croc. vs. Great White Shark- as everyone would anticipate, the shark wins Grizzly Bear vs Siberian Tiger- Hey man! The bear beats the tiger to submission!!! Lion v Nile croc- crocy wins this time, the king of the jungle gets gobbled up. Polar bear vs Walrus- its quite hard to imagine the lumbering ball of blubber could win (walrus) Anaconda vs Jaguar- quite obvious, the snake. What can a cat do to a 15 foot long reptile??? Gorilla vs Leopard- this time, our animal cousins take the lead. American Alligator vs Black bear- Teddy gets the trophy this round Giant Squid vs Sperm Whale- now this is really one that I would not wanna miss. (as in I haven't seen the results yet)  Actually, theory wise, the elephant wins almost about every animal (unless the predator is in groups) A frenzied bull elephant can just trample everything in its path.  Of all animals, I still like the wild dogs. U know, in one documentary, they were such an efficient hunting pack that they KILLED an ELEPHANT!!! And they chased up a tiger and its cub up a tree once. Talk about teamwork!!!  Argh... this week ended, was just about the most eventful week I ever had!

      On thurs, we had erm... english festival. Cool. Can slack all the way as we have no lessons, har har.  The first part of the festival was some acting shit. We are supposed to create a fairy tale that has a few fairy tale characters. In our case, we got the big bad wolf, Jack, Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the bear prince. Well, I was Jack. Personally, I must say that I prefer some Geography skit that we often do in class than this mixed tale shit.  The second part was Taboo!!! Its a guessing game like Pictionary, except that u dun act, u say! But then of course u dun say the word, u say something about it and then ppl in your group would guess it out. Anyway it goes like this. If the word is wolf, then I'll say a cousin of the fox, then ppl would guess it out. But then there are some words that u can't use because its too related.  For my case, the funniest one was doughnut. As in the word 'doughnut'. First, I asked, "What do squirrels like to eat???" Then my group guessed nut. Then what about dough??? So I said, "What are the two lumps at the back of the classroom, sticking on the wall?" So everyone managed to guess the word dough. How???  Refer to my previous July entry about 'Dough'. I think u would understand. Anyway, yes, the lumps of dough are still stuck on the wall. For one thing, they  are too high for us to reach without standing on the chair (and we are all lazy fellows). For another thing, those decomposing crap are too disgusting for anyone to want to do the job.  After that is 'Treasure Hunt'. My god, thats so 'yesterday'...  Then we had lunch break, then were supposed to watch a literary-related movie. I watched Shakespeare in Love, it was pretty good, probably the best in the list of movies given to us. Mind u, Shakespeare in love is R(A), but that was the cut version anyway.  And on Fri??? National day celebration!!! Yay, we get dismissed at 10am!!! Of course they started with the usual headmaster's speech, then they did some story which made us all sing. Actually, we were supposed to sing, not that we wanted to. Then, dismissal!  And today (Saturday) was history drama!!! I think RI did ok, wondered why it only got the 2nd runner up. In the end, Nanyang Girls won, like last year. I think that was cos our play was too humorous that the judges decided to de-grade us or something. Lol.  After that I watched i-robot, it was pretty cool, the storyline was quite okay. The ending was not a cliche one, the twist was nice, anyway a nice movie that I would recommend (though not a Spiderman 2 or something).  And what about tomorrow??? Sux as usual, swimming in the morning. Sheesh. Maybe it'll be backstroke 30 laps this time...

      On Weds, we had stupid, loathsome, irritating, agonising cross-country. And I wanted to do yeoman service (to slack off lol)  But then the number of ppl doing yeoman was far above expectations, so I was turned down.  And that morning, I entered my class only to find a Jap. student there (he's an exchange student). His name was Yoshio, if I put that in English. Well, so anyway, we had the good fortune of having an NMA that day (NMA= no morning assembly)  Talk about communicating. Its a wonder I can learn a bit of Jap through watching anime and hence, I am one of the ppl Aaron (who was Yoshio's buddy) chose to stick close with him.  Then we got quite a shock when our Chinese teacher Mdm Bek Su Ling saw him. She could converse in Jap pretty fluently!!! Talk about teachers giving us surprises! First Law Hock Ling could dance, then Bek Su Ling could speak Jap!!!  So, anyway, for the cross country, I put on the worst house T-shirt ever (my house was Buckley and boy, it sucked all right! We always got top five, but then again, there were five houses so u get what I mean) then got ready for the run, so on. Walked some distance to Mac Ritchie reservoir for our cross country trail. Then discovered something sickening: last year we did 3.2 km. Now, its 4.8!!!  Well, Yoshio-san said his CCA was soccer, so we figured that since Julian (our class monitor) couldn't run that day (talk about luck!!!) he could do some running too. So Julian lent his Buckle shirt to Yoshio-san.  So when we started, it was like omg, the first 100 metres were just squeezing and squashing and banging into each other. Aaron asked Yoshio-san to run with me (cos he didn't want him to run with Aaron as, well, Aaron's the fattest boy in class, so his running is _) but then he said that in case Yoshio couldn't keep up (I am the class 3rd fastest, but then we do not have much good runners in the class anyway) then Yoshio could slow down and wait for another guy from our class to run with him. Well, another slower guy, that is.  The trail was horrible. The first half was like pebbles and rocks and mud all over. I slipped for a few times on the mud at the sides, when I was not looking front (as in, Gabriel Quek and Yoshio were following me so I wanted to see how they were going). I hate the terrain, it was going high, then low, then high again. So, occasionally we saw a few first aid guys or house guys around a corner, waving the house flag. Then I would just shout "Buckley rox!!!" and continue running. Well, I prefer something to take me off my mind a bit. However, after about 800m, Gabriel started slowing down. So it was Yoshio and me now, with 30 or so more ppl at our front.  The second part was pavement and more pavement.Well, I kept looking down at the drain, then I did a dumb thing: I started getting bored of running and doing nothing, so I counted the no. of drains we had past. When I lost count, I counted the no. of bus stops we past (6 approx). The demoralising thing is the cars on the road. They hit 60-80 km/h so u would start to feel that u are really damn slow when next to the car. Well, humans are humans, and cars are cars, I have nothing to say.  So, when exactly did I lose Yoshio-san??? The thing is, I didn't. He ran with me the ENTIRE way!!! He was right next beside me for the full 4.8km! Omg, he's fast! I think he could be faster than me as he may think that it is best to follow a familiar face around than to run alone in a foreign land. Cool. Where our top class runner Nelson Chua was busy doing Yeoman service (hey! shouldn't a runner be running and not doing service??? I am growing jealous of him being able to slack) and Nelson is a true blue Buckleyian, Rafflesian and Singaporean, Yoshio-san was running with me, and he's neither a Buckleyian nor a Rafflesian, not even a Singaporean. Nelson should be ashamed.  So anyway, I came in the 31st of approx. 450 students in the sec 2 batch. And yay, top fifty get points for their house and get badges. So Yoshio got a badge whereby Nelson didn't! Who called him not to run???  Btw, we came in around 20+ mins. Aaron came in around 45 mins. LOL.

      Aw..man  As I expected, we were supposed to swim an *easy* 30 continuous laps of *simple* butterfly stroke.  It took me *only* about an hour.  *For all those Merchant of Venice readers, here's a key question: What's Mark's tone and attitude as he says these sentences???  Swimming really sux.  And guess what?? 3 hours ago, someone died of heart attack in the same pool 3 hours ago. He took a swim even when he felt uncomfortable.  So we are swimming the same pool which a man died in.  Maybe next swimming lessons, *I* might die too. Of fatigue.  Oh, and I added a few add-ons to my blog and went for some Personality Disorder Test. Check out the bottom for results. Btw, the highest one can go is Extremely high (which is bad) after which is very high. So I am quite okay after all.  Sheng Hao, u might wanna go try it lol.
