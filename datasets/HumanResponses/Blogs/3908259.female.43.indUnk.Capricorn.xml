      I sort of passed out watching t.v. last night. Someone tell me how JAG ended. I woke up at 4. And then crawled into bed until 8:30. Showered and went to the spa, had a free parafin wax dip for my hands (a very strange sensation), hair done, nails done, eyebrows done, pedicure (heaven!!!). I feel pretty relaxed I must say. So relaxed I'm actually tired!

      Almost too tired to eat but not quite. Tonight will be quiet. Some dinner (a treat -- pigout on pasta!). Some wine. Some JAG (yeah, it's in re-runs but so what of it). Some sleep I hope. Tomorrow a late morning/early afternoon at the spa.  Then  I can start cleaning and doing whatever I need to do before my company comes on Tuesday. But for now,  RELAX BABY!   And hopefully, nobody will bother me. I'm going into my cave now. Unless you're an available man that meets my exacting standards, who is willing to give me&nbsp;a foot massage .... Otherwise (or ReGina) go away!

      I got to work late yet again so I worked through lunch. But it's been non-stop. As a colleague said first thing this morning, "It is Friday I hope." I think we all feel that way. When your clients are developers, you are dealing with people that have huge sums of money invested in land. They are banking on developing that land. In the meanwhile, they may have more than $1 million on acreage, which they have loans on and are paying large monthly interest payments. They really do need those parcels developed, sooner rather than later. Of course, I work in a county that has a very large "no-growth" contingent in office because they are fearful of the area looking like the neighboring county to the east, and it is the fastest growing county in Virginia and one of the fastest in the country. So you have opposing viewpoints. The developers believe that the County is deliberately holding them back and the County believes it is just trying to keep up with the development applications they get on a daily basis. I think it's somewhere in between. I think that the developers forget that they are not the only people building on open land and the County, even if they don't overtly intend to, take too damn long to review documents. They have a luxury I don't have. My clients would be furious if I told them I'd take 6 weeks to review things for them. The County says "you want it approved? Six weeks." Sometimes they don't get things done in a timely fashion and then the client gets pissed off and wants us to yell at the County. Lot of good that does. "Fine, you want it back now? Not approved." So we avoid that scenario since that means another 6 week review process generally. Some days it's rather frustrating because frankly, the clients can be a bunch of prima donnas. Like the client that hung the phone up so forcefully the other day, it was really like he hung up ON me. He was here today, everything's cool, but at the time, it really did hurt my ear. Not to mention, ruffle my feathers a bit.  So, I'm glad it's Friday and that I don't have to deal with this shit for a few days. I'll go home and deal with home improvement instead.

      I've been mulling Andy's comment to me over, and was pretty darned close to doing a very long audioblog explaining my accent, but decided to wait. At first I thought, what was he expecting my voice to sound like, Chinese? But then I realized he was expecting some really thick Bronx accent. Well, I never had the thickest of 'em. And living outside of NY for more than 26 years hasn't helped, nor has the fact that I easily pick up accents. In another life I could have been a translator or linguist (nah, and I'm not going say I'm a cunning linguist because I'm not a man and I don't swing that way, and this isn't a post about fellation after all. We can leave that for another time). Hey, when I talk to ReGina or my sister-in-law, I twang. But if you like, when Pam and HK get here next week (6 days!!!), I'll audioblog for ya and you'll certainly hear something more Bronx. It comes out in the right circumstances.&nbsp; And that will certainly scare the cats out of the garden!

      How come the one night I DON'T have insomnia, I wake up to the sound of the alarm bleeping upstairs? Because there I was, fully dressed, on the couch in some weird position with my head half off it. Hell, I still had my glasses on, which means I attempted to watch t.v. Half glass of wine undrunk, plate from dinner sitting on the coffee table. Lights on in the kitchen. But from sleeping in such an unusual position, I am stuffed up and my throat hurts. Why can't I sleep  in bed  all night without waking up a gazillion times, or at 4 a.m. unable to go back to sleep?

      My dad has informed me, quite emphatically, that I am far prettier than any picture I have ever posted or sent via email shows. Basically, he told me to stop posting pictures of me that don't show how attractive I really am. Now of course, he is my dad and therefore, is prejudiced. But I've always said I'm not photogenic. I can count on one hand the pictures of me as an adult that I like. That portray me as what I see in the mirror. And they're on Kodak paper. So I suppose this means that I need the "Dad Seal of Approval" before I post anymore pictures with me in them.

      Rupublican or not, he is square shooting and I really respect him for it.  From  urlLink www.cnn.com :  Sen. John McCain of Arizona broke forcefully with President Bush and the Senate GOP leadership Tuesday evening over the issue, taking to the Senate floor to call such a constitutional amendment unnecessary -- and un-Republican.  "The constitutional amendment we're debating today strikes me as antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of Republicans," McCain said. "It usurps from the states a fundamental authority they have always possessed and imposes a federal remedy for a problem that most states do not believe confronts them."  McCain also said the amendment "will not be adopted by Congress this year, nor next year, nor any time soon until a substantial majority of Americans are persuaded that such a consequential action is as vitally important and necessary as the proponents feel it is today."  "The founders wisely made certain that the Constitution is difficult to amend and, as a practical political matter, can't be done without overwhelming public approval. And thank God for that," he said.

       Recent Musical Forays : Aimee Mann's  Lost in Space , by far one of my favorite records. When this record came out, I practically OD'd on it, I listened to it so much. Over and over and over again. It's rather dark and introspective. My heart was feeling rather dark and introspective and it spoke to me. It still does, even as I am not feeling dark. It still is great music and lyrics. To read more about this wonderful record, I always recommend AMG, All Music,  urlLink www.allmusic.com .

      Tried sending a post via email. Tried it yesterday a few times and it doesn't appear to have worked. It was an uneventful evening last night. I put up a Smithfield pork loin fillet. I haven't eaten it but it's ready to go for lunch today and a number of meals afterward, being that it's 3 pounds and I put up 5 packages in the freezer. What did I eat for dinner? Chips and salsa.  Very  healthy. Well, they were reduced fat. And I ate really good all day, sort of -- grapes, a few mouthfuls of sugar-free cream cheese cheesecake for a co-worker's birthday (I ate the strawberries out of it), a "flat out" flat bread with whipped chive cream cheese, coffee, tea, diet rite tangerine soda, another "flat out" flat bread with hummus, more tea, water, and a Kirkland (Costco) brand version of a Slim Fast shake. And chips and salsa. And a glass of pinot grigio. What was I thinking?! Have I salvaged the day by drinking a glass of milk?

      From Redbook -- Jada Pinkett Smith was asked "I hear you're very close to your stepchild, Trey" and she responded " Bonus  child.  Step  has such an ugly meaning."  I like that.   I liked it so much I wrote my stepmom and told her that from now on she's Bonus Mom. And after 27 years, she agrees. We are bonus family, not "step" family.

      I have already posted this on Ben Mize's bulletin board ( urlLink www.benmize.com ).  I realize that I am leaving out our friends from other countries for this request, so begging your pardon. I am taking this opportunity to ask anyone that is not registered to vote, to do so. Check out  urlLink www.declareyourself.com . This is a non-partisan effort headed by Norman Lear. Jimmy Carter, Lady Bird Johnson and Nancy Reagan are all involved. The idea is that we have such poor voter turnout and that your vote DOES COUNT! How you vote doesn't matter but voting is a privilege. I may be preaching to the choir on this site since everyone here is pretty astute, but I feel pretty strongly about voting. Perhaps it's from my upbringing, my mom being employed by the Mayor of NYC and being a delegate to state convention and waking up to God only knows who eating bagels in our kitchen on Sunday mornings (chief of police, school board, community leaders, the real meaning of "kitchen cabinet"). I have since age 18, always had a voter registration card. I make it my business to vote in every election, no matter for what. I won't lecture about who to vote for. I don't vote on personality but issues anyhow. I can't tell you what to think. I can ask you to vote. Thanks for your time.

      I don't know that I'll like this any better and truthfully, I was seriously thinking about using mblog instead since it uses moveable type, but this has an easier interface and I don't have time to deal with anything that isn't 1-2-3, click. But this is FREEEEEE! And Xanga is not. So I figured I'd switch over while I could because I really don't want to pay for premium xanga again next year. Let me know what you think. I'm testing templates right now.

      So I crawl in bed last night figuring I'd just chill and watch some t.v. At 3 a.m. I wake up fretting that I have to go to work and I'll be late if I don't get moving and why didn't the alarm go off. This constant feeling like I'm going to be late for work at 3 a.m., especially when it's Saturday and I  don't  have to go to work, is getting really, really old.

      You know if I could just stop feeling so tired, I'd bet my day would be going a lot better. My motivation, on a scale of 1 to 10, is about a -15. I just ate the most fabulous meatloaf sandwich from South Street Under and now I'm ready for a little nap. But I have to work. It's been a bad billing week. Luckily, last week was a great billing week and makes up for this week. Frankly, I'm just so fed up with some of the files and the clients, I could care less.   It happens. I'll get over it. In the meantime, it's Friday, thank God! Even with Wednesday off, this week couldn't have been any longer. In fact, except for Wednesday, which flew, it's been a dreadfully long week and today, I keep looking at the clock and it's still only 1:30. The only thing that flew by was lunch. Figures.  Tomorrow, I have lunch with Vito, where I get all the Martin & Seibert gossip. Then I go to Cheryl's grandson's birthday party and divulge all the M&S gossip. Should be fun. If I can get the energy, I'll go see F9/11 since it's playing in Hagerstown and Martinsburg and not in Winchester. I'll stop in Martinsburg on the way home then and see it there. Yup. The birthday party is in Maryland. Why did I agree to drive through two other states to go to a 2-year old's birthday party? Maybe because Cheryl's a really good friend? Yeah, well. I guess. And really Hagerstown's only 45 miles. No further than work.  One good thing about Pam and Sara visiting was that I finally got off my lazy ass and CLEANED and STRAIGHTENED. It's a mess again. I looked in the guest bath this morning and there are towels all over the place but it ain't no big deal. I have to do laundry yet again anyhow. That train never stops.

The Crows were fucking amazing. I don't know that I've ever heard them sound that good.  It was so friggin' hot and we were all saying "I feel gross" or "I feel disgusting". Makeup -- melted off. Clothes -- drenched. We were stinky and sweaty and well, gross. But it was amazing.

I want to go home, eat something, although I'm more thirsty than hungry, get undressed, crawl in bed and flip through the t.v. channels and chill.  It's raining and 77 degrees. Why couldn't it have been 77 degrees yesterday?

      Thanks to Vito. From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this. What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life? &nbsp; Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions: If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. &nbsp; Then: H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% &nbsp; and K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96% &nbsp; But A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% &nbsp; And B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% &nbsp; AND, look how far ass kissing will take you. A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118% &nbsp; So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that while Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, it's the Bullshit and Ass kissing that will put you over the top.

      I spent until 11 p.m. trying to get even more done. I changed the cat litter, washed the kitchen floor (a losing battle, it was in such bad shape from prior owners, nothing short of a steam cleaning will do), got rid of more clutter, and re-straightened up the kitchen (it wasn't cleaned up enough). Luckily, I have a doctor's appointment today so I can get home early and finish up.&nbsp; Ms. I Hate To Vacuum will have to break down and just do it tonight. Somewhere around the house is a good gold earring. Sometime after 3 p.m., I lost it. No idea where it is, I've searched high and low. Vacuuming will mean "bye-bye" but it has to be done.

      Just shut my mouth! When I realistically look at the list I accomplish at the end of a weekend, I know why I'm tired. I think it's that I set a list that no human could accomplish and then say, "well, didn't get anything done". But I DID!&nbsp; Four loads of laundry plus bath and kitchen mats, cooking for future meals, finally got most of the CDs away (cataloging is for another project somewhere in the next four to six months, not to worry about now), dishes washed and put away, kitchen straightened up, a whole lot of clutter cleaned up, bathrooms scrubbed. And I still found time to just sit and read the Sunday Post. I still have to FOLD the laundry, which is the part I really hate, but at least it's washed!

      I have to go back to my other time-worn staple -- my weight and my body. Honestly, I have been just this side of manic lately and I've been worried I'm going to go off the deep-end. I talked with Phyll (my bonus mom) and she told me it's not going to happen because I am so much more centered than I was 10 years ago and so much more aware of my triggers. Nonetheless, I think about my finances day and night and night and day and then I don't sleep and that makes me more likely to be anxious and then I'm tired and it's a vicious cycle. I'm seriously due for a long yoga session. In the meantime, I found this article on  urlLink http://www.fitnessmagazine.com &nbsp;and from what I've read, it's true and I need to remind myself of it. I won't go into a tirade about my thoughts on low-carb. My own thing about low-sugar has more to do with the diabetic genetics in my family than a diet craze. When your mother is a diabetic, and her father was, and his father, brothers and so on, you take the threat seriously. I have a big sweet tooth, so if I find a product made with Splenda that I like, I buy it and use it. Every little bit. Recently, I bought some grapes that have been so sweet, they rival any candybar. So here's the article:     10 Diet Lessons From the FrenchSay oui to Brie! Brie has 95 calories an ounce, compared to 114 for cheddar .&nbsp; By Anne Marie O'Connor     1. Petite isn't just a dress size . One of the reasons France has an 11 percent obesity rate (as compared to America's 33 percent) is portion control. "A croissant in Paris is one ounce, while in Pittsburgh it's two," notes Chris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., a professor of nutrition at Georgia State University. Buy one and share it with your beau.   2. Never say diet . The French don't get involved in the carbs versus protein debate, nor do they label food groups like dairy or beef "bad." "There's an emphasis on eating a wide variety of foods-fruits, vegetables, beef, poultry, fish, bread and cheese-without overdoing any one thing," explains Susan Herrmann Loomis, a cooking teacher in Louviers, France, and author of the cooking memoir  On Rue Tatin  (Broadway Books, 2001).   3. There's no French equivalent of Butter Buds . Most French regard processed foods with the utter disdain they usually reserve for instant coffee. In other words, they'd rather have a small piece of "real" chocolate than a big slab of some low-fat chocolate dessert. The fact is, the sugar calories in low-fat sweets probably negate any fat grams saved-which won't get you any closer to fitting into those YSL jeans.   4. Snacking is a faux pas . They rarely snack, and they eat meals only while sitting at a table. Americans, on the other hand, eat everywhere-in our cars, at our desks, in the checkout line at the grocery store. In fact, the average calorie consumption in the United States is 3,642 a day, versus 3,551 in France-a small difference that can add up to a five-pound weight gain in six months.  Quelle horreur!   &nbsp;   5. Soak up the color . French women fill up on bright-colored vegetables, whether they're in zucchini soup or a beet, lettuce and cabbage salad before their entrée. Good thing, too, since the antioxidants in these foods help stave off the free radicals produced by cigarette smoke.   6. Make the most of meals . The French space out their courses and eat them at a leisurely pace-generally with friends and family, reports Loomis. In addition to cutting down on indigestion, this practice makes them less likely to overindulge, because the sensation of fullness has time to develop.   7. Wine and dine . Bordeaux and Beaujolais are staples, but French women usually drink them with their meal-no guzzling one or two glasses at the bar before dinner. Plus, glasses in France are only partially filled-the better to taste the wine and cut down on calories.   8. C'est cheese . They love cheese, but treat it as if it were a delicacy-eating it only after meals and stopping after just a slice or two, says Loomis. And although French cheeses seem rich, many (like Brie and chèvre) are actually lower in calories than American favorites.   9. Park your car . Thirty-five percent of the time, the French get where they're going by walking or biking. Americans don't leave home without their cars a whopping 84 percent of the time.   10. Boycott the buffet . In France, you won't find many all-you-can-eat fests, such as brunch buffets, tailgate parties and unlimited pasta and dessert bars, where it's easy for the calories to add up quickly. The French realize that they will get to eat again in a few hours.

      I spent a very nice morning playing vegetable and reading the rest of last week's Sunday Post. Then I spent a busy but enjoyable afternoon at the museum topped off by a small gelato. I have spent a not so enjoyable hour reconciling my checking account but I am now going to relish a quiet evening, just me, the rain outside (it sounds monsterous -- all booming, but I'm indoors so I don't care), a nice glass of something (wine or beer or ?) and Alexander Hamilton. Me and relaxing in the same breath. Amazing!

      I went to Outback last night with Cheryl. We seem to get together so rarely lately and it was nice, just us girls having a gabfest. We ordered an appetizer. But the "law of restaurants" was working last night: If you don't order an appetizer, your meal will take 1-1/2 hours to reach your table, by which time you will eat anything. However, if you order an appetizer, the kitchen will get your meal to you within 5 minutes of the appetizer being brought out to you and you will juggle your appetizer, your salad and your entree all at the same time.  And then we got the evil eye a few times for not eating faster and getting the hell out of there so they could turn the table. So, I have about 10 oz of a 12 oz prime rib and part of a baked potato in my fridge, just waiting for me to eat today. When I got done with wings (they were really good) and my salad and some bread, I wasn't all that hungry anymore anyhow.  A Daily Grind opened next door and we went there to sit a little while longer since it was still so early.

      To everyone wanting a piece of me, mostly my money:  The gravy train is out of steam.  I have nothing left to give. I have come out of a very expensive six months and I am busted, broke, out of money. Don't even think about asking me to buy something from Southern Living, Pampered Chef, Boy Scouts, American Cancer, Polio Plus, local firefighters or whomever you are collecting for. All worthy but I have nothing left to give. If I haven't made it clear, let me say it one more time -- I have nothing left to give so keep your hands off my wallet.

      I thought that I'd take a quick nap before dinner. Next thing I knew it was 2 a.m.!  With any luck, that sleep, and it was a good sleep, will go a long way to helping me feel better. I still dont' feel "right" but I can say that I don't feel like poopie. It's a good running start.

      Sad&nbsp; urlLink     I wish I could say I felt better. I am starting to see a pattern however. Eating has a big part of it. Feeling stressed has a lot to do with it and they've been going hand in hand. I have little appetite and when I do, it's for junk. Last night I indulged myself with 2 reduced fat kosher hot dogs, sauerkraut, the buns and some kick ass maple cured bacon baked beans (almost fat free) and then, I ate some potato chips with homemade dip (sour cream and medium chunky salsa). And a sugar free tangerine soda. I was pretty happy. I'd say my meal was 70% okay and 30% junk.   After contemplation and discussion with my bonus mom, I am foregoing the gym until my next session with Dre and dedicating myself to pure hatha yoga. No power yoga, no ashtanga yoga, certainly no Bikram yoga. Just plain, old-fashioned hatha yoga. I'm not even going to concern myself with flow. Just asana and pranayama. Pose and breath.   It's been a little difficult doing yoga around Sweetpea as he thinks it's time to cuddle -- I have often found myself mid-Warrior 2 to feel his tail hitting my thighs, looking down and finding him standing and then sitting right underneath the space between my feet. I may have to close the door. OTOH, if I do any serious savasana, he'll just curl up next to me and that'll be okay too.

      On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.   My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.   But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.   While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.   Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west, all the way to Hawaii, in search of opportunity.   And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents.  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or "blessed," believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.   They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential.   They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride.   And I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters.   I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth, is my story even possible.   Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."   That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- or at least, most of the time.   This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.   And fellow Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college.   Now don't get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to.   Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon.   Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.   People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.   In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry.   John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service, because they've defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.   John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he'll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home.   John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves.   John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.   John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.  And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.   You know, a while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6-2 or 6-3, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week.   And as I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us?   I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists.   When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.   Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated.   John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.   John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are all connected as one people.   If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child.   If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent.  If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.   It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work.   It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. "E pluribus unum." Out of many, one.   Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.   Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America.   There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there is the United States of America.   The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.   We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states.   There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it.   We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.   In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?   John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here-the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it.   That's not what I'm talking [about]. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.   Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.   In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; a belief in things not seen; a belief that there are better days ahead.   I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.   I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.   I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.   America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president. And John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president. And this country will reclaim its promise. And out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.   Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.

       urlLink Mary Oliver: Online Poems   The Journey  One day you finally knew what you had to do, and began, though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice-- though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles. "Mend my life!" each voice cried. But you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough, and a wild night, and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds, and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own, that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do-- determined to save the only life you could save.   © Mary Oliver.

      Let's see, last night Pilates felt horrible. I was still so sore from ab work the night before, it was just this side of painful. Then Dre and I trained. Calves and hamstrings, not too bad, but then ab work. Today. my entire tummy is screaming "ouch!". How bad is it? Coughing hurts.  On top of which, I look like crap. I just looked at myself in the mirror and I frightened myself. Circles under my eyes. I feel so tired. I just want to sleep. I don't know how much of this is that I'm still not sleeping well or switching back to Celexa. He who shall not be named used to say that I had a small case of narcolepsy on the Celexa, that it made me drowsy. I don't really recall that but I do know that I already feel calmer inside. I'm pretty manic today despite the sleepiness but I can feel the core of me getting more relaxed.  I so want to go home and sleep.

      I don't even know why I'm typing this. I have nothing to say. Except that an hour of Pilates followed by an hour of training calves, hamstrings and abs (yeah, even after an hour of Pilates) and I am so fucking tired and worn out. My head is saying "sleep" and my body is saying "go, go, go!" and "lie down" at the same time. I think my head may win this war. Night.

      All day, my heretofore numb lower abdomen has been sore from yesterday's workout. There's the part of me saying "yippee" because I can feel it and it's taken 3 years for that to happen. I just loved going to classes where the instructor said "feel it?" and I said "no" because the whole area was numb. The nerves were cut and feeling anything in that spot is difficult at best. Yet, after much serious abdominal work, I CAN feel that area now, or at least the underlying muscles are finally letting me know they are still there. Or maybe the nerve-endings are growing back. In any case, I can feel that area and everything else too. All 14 some abdominal "muscles" (because they are really just one big muscle) are screaming a collective "ow!". So what am I going to do tonight? Go to Pilates. And then take my second to last training session with Dre, at least for a while or until some rich unknown relative adopts me. I am truly out of my mind.  The only reason I can give for this insanity is that it is the only thing that stands between me and some day looking like a shorter version of my mother, a fate worse than death IMNSHO. And I'm not talking about my mother's face, or her eyes, which are incredibly beautiful (green). But her weight. I like to eat. I like food. Food is comfort. Food is family. Food is friends. Food is good times. I am no longer going to feel guilty about it. I LIKE FOOD. No! I LOVE FOOD! But I don't want it to love me to death. I have the cholesterol thing that makes me a walking stroke possibility. I can't ignore the issue or that I have other genetic health issues lurking in the shadows. So while I have to admit (although it isn't always apparent), I really don't like going to the gym and I don't really like exercising, I can get excited about it once I get there (it's the getting there that's hard) and I need the gym and I need the exercise to stave off the mommy genes that I have hardwired into my system. And, I really do like the results. Because I've finally come to the conclusion that I will no longer be a skinny minny without starving myself and I'm not going to do that. So I must exercise and weight train. So if I can't be little, I can be fit. I can't wait until there's a Star Trek pill that will make it all go away without side effects so I can become my true self -- a couch potato with a love of chips and salsa.

      Is it possible for a day to drag on and on like this? The continuing theme. I work. I bore myself to tears. It's not that it's not busy. I am very busy. I just don't feel any sense of accomplishment. I can't work on any one project, without the tug of another. So everything is in a constant state of flux. It is not good.  The "new" meds seem to be doing their trick. I am already feeling better. Placebo? Maybe. I don't care. If it works, it's good enough for me.

      I had to force myself to go. The day after a migraine is usually pretty rough. I was tired. I was cranky. But I made myself go. 15 minutes on the arctrainer. Then about 75 squats, then crunches on the ball&nbsp;holding 8 pound medicine ball (50), then crunches on the floor (50), then pelvic lifts with 8 pound medicine ball resting on pelvis (50), then more crunches on a decline bench holding 10 pound weight (2 sets 25 each), then standing side to side for obliques (25 each side for 50 total), then 15 more minutes on the arctrainer.&nbsp; Not the best workout&nbsp;but certainly not the worst. I have training with Dre tomorrow. I'm down to 2 sessoins. I'll also try to get to her Pilates class immediately before training. Weighed in, no gain, no loss. Not complaining.

      But if the day went any slower I'd be going backwards. I cannot believe how slow it is. The computer clock says 1:56 and the telephone clock says 2:02 but either way, it's at least 3 hours til I leave and I want to go home NOW!. Actually, I think I'd better drag my sorry ass to the gym tonight before I get out of practice. As it is, it's about 2 weeks and I'm going to be hurting. But I saw Dre Saturday (eating Route 11 potato chips -- so she does go off diet occasionally!!!! Ammo!) and promised her I'd be in today. So I'll go in.    Music for a rainy afternoon:  Dishwalla,  And you think you know what life's about . This is one of my favorite CDs. I really can't say why. I just like it.    Once In A While      When you close your eyes  Do you like what you see?  Inside your mindAnd do you like to dream  About the stars above?  Once in a while   Don't go to the other side  For nothing at all  Better make it worth your while  Gonna break down that wall  Gonna take the fall   Don't go to the other side  You might mess up that hair  Just wait you might change your mind  To think that people might care  About your hair anyway   Don't go to the other side  Just get down on your knees  Show me what you are made of  I'm begging you please  Just please go away  Don't go to the other side

      Yup. Today was WalMart. At least this time I was there before everyone got out of&nbsp;church and it wasn't a total zoo. It was actually pretty empty for a Sunday. I much prefer Friday nights there but oh well. At least that's done for a few weeks. And I have a 90-day supply of Celexa so I won't need to go there for scripts for quite a while. Yeah, switching back to Celexa from Lexipro. I told the doc I thought it worked better for me and he said he saw no reason not to give it a whirl. I really love that guy.  Been fighting the mother of all headaches today. Even a nap didn't help. An Exedrin Tension Headache and a few large mugs of coffee have. I'm sure the large number of salty potato chips I've indulged in today have not aided my cause. I'm thinking a little yoga might however.  Working on the book update. I think I'm in better shape than I thought I'd be. I'm finding some very good material to use. I have realized I can't find the disks with the original chapters on them. I'm certainly not going to ask Steve to look for them. No way Jose!&nbsp; I have asked my editor however and I hope she can accommodate me. There really isn't another solution.  Well, back to editing and the never-ending laundry pile.

      Yesterday was a pretty busy day.   First, I met my friend, Vito, for lunch at Village Square. He fed me both lunch and all the dirt from my former law firm, where he still works, poor guy. Everyone is leaving. The alum list for that firm is quite long.  Then, I went to Hagerstown (MD) City Park Duck Island for the birthday party of my friend Cheryl's 2- year old grandson, Ashton. Shannon, Cheryl's daughter, did so much to enhance the duck theme of the party. She's really creative and did homemade invitations, gift bags, thank you cards, none of which looked homemade. She could go into business. We all got thank you cards for coming to the party with new pictures of Ashton, who's getting really big! There were also Hershey bars that were in special wrappers (of course with ducks) and the cake was also in the shape of a duck. All the kids got cupcakes that had little rubber duckies as the toppers. Never a dull moment, Ashton fell in the pond&nbsp; when they went to feed the ducks and his dad had to go home and get him a change of clothes. I was figuring it'd be cake and ice cream. I forgot that I was dealing with this wonderful family and that there was enough food to feed 3xs the people that were there. I was stuffed.   The park was&nbsp;a lovely little park in S. Hagerstown. I'd never been there. Across the street, are some very old mansion houses. It looks like it might have been the wealthy area of Hagerstown back in the day but those days are obviously gone. The park is beautiful though and has a number of natural habitat areas. There's also a museum in the park. I've lived in this area for 4 years and didn't even know it existed.  Since I was heading back through Martinsburg (WV), I stopped to see  F9/11  but missed it by 15 minutes so I saw  I, Robot  instead. I LOVED it. 2 hours but not once did I wonder what time it was. It just moved along and was engaging from beginning to end. Going by the theater in Winchester today, I noticed that we do now have  F9/11  so I won't have to go to Martinsburg to see it. Until this week, it was not playing in Winchester. Next weekend I think.

      Just me and a couple of magazines (September Fall preview, just heaven), lazin' away the afternoon.  This, after taking kitty to the vet and finding out that he has allergies. To what? Not sure. First, there's the low allergen food that he's been on for 3 weeks. Another 3 weeks should tell if it's something he's eating. In the meantime, he's had a prednisone shot which will clear up the scabs and crusties he's developed. I have to not wear any perfume or burn candles or do anything with scent (I am not giving up my shampoo!!), and of course, his only snack now is a handful of his low allergen food, but he seems okay with that.  I'm going back to loafing now.

      It is such an absolutely beautiful Fall day here. Yeah, it's Summer but tell Mother Nature that! Sky is robin's egg blue with nary a cloud. Driving in, I could say there were no clouds at all, not even a puff or wisp of one. I see a few now but nothing serious. Everything looks so  green . Lately, coming over the mountain it's been either foggy or hazy. Today you could see 10-15 miles or more. The Blue Ridge were earning their name. Things appear so in focus. And it's 66 degrees out with almost no humidity to speak of. And it's boring at the office with nothing to do and I am just wasting my time being here. So, I have the window open in my office (at least it opens!) and I'm enjoying the cool breeze and the clean fresh smell.

       urlLink http://www.yogasite.com/panicattack.htm   A wonderful article on yoga and panic anxiety disorder. Get a Grip on Panic Attacks by Rolf Sovik  Jeff was sure he was having a heart attack. His heart was pounding faster than it ever had before. His chest ached and the pain radiated toward his left arm. He felt shaky. As he tried to focus on what was happening to him, the world grew distant and unreal. Anxiety welled up. Jeff managed to call his physician, who arranged for quick transport to the emergency room. There, however, a battery of tests failed to reveal the cause of his symptoms. A second attack occurred a few days later, and still no physiological cause could be found. Before long, panic attacks had become part of Jeff’s life.  Recognizing Panic Disorder Everyone sometimes feels anxious for no identifiable reason. At these times we think, “Something is happening—I must stay alert.” Panic victims share these feelings, but for them the stakes are higher. Their distress is so overwhelming that the fearful possibilities take on mammoth proportions. “I’m having a heart attack,” they think, or “I’m losing my mind.” We all experience periods of vague anxiety, which often pass without our ever discovering or having to acknowledge the causes. Panic anxiety, however, is the cue for a determined (and often desperate) search for a source.  Panic attacks are characterized by rapidly escalating and overwhelming anxiety. In the beginning, panickers are rarely able to identify what has made them anxious, describing the episodes as occurring “out of the blue.” The attacks are triggered by frightening physical sensations that occur suddenly, much like an unconscious reflex. Among the most common are shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, a feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, and dizziness. Frightened sufferers develop painfully sharp sensitivity to these sensations, often making several trips to the emergency room before they finally realize that their symptoms are panic-related.  Physical sensations alone are not the core of the illness. Fearful thoughts, unpleasant emotions, avoidant behaviors, disturbing sensations, and deteriorating relationships all collude with one another to maintain panic. Thoughts such as the fear of dying or of having a mental breakdown are common. Even mild anxiety can trigger an attack, and any disturbing emotion can be interpreted as a precursor to full-fledged panic.  Gradually, the fear of having an attack in public leads the panicker to avoid those places—a disorder known as agoraphobia. Problems in relationships, which may have been the original source of anxiety, become worse as panic episodes develop. Difficulty with self-assertiveness and with the resolution of conflicts increases. Friends and partners are often frustrated because they cannot understand what is happening.   The Road to Recovery Fortunately, panic disorder can be treated successfully, frequently with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Panic sufferers are now turning to yoga for help as well, for yoga offers a wide range of stress-reducing tools. An ancient model of recovery can be found in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, one which is also embodied in the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha. In its briefest form, this model is an outline of the stages in the healing process, presented here as four questions:  1. What is the nature of the pain that all humans experience? 2. What is the cause of that pain? 3. What will be experienced when the pain is removed? 4. How can the pain be removed?  Yoga tells us that before searching for a cure it is important to look deeply into the nature and causes of illness. It is also important to get an idea of how things will be when symptoms have been removed, because otherwise we may have illusions about what recovery will be like. For example, eliminating anxiety is not the outcome of treatment for panic—the outcome is the ability to manage anxious feelings. If we rewrite the four questions of the ancient model, focusing on panic attacks, they might read:  1. What is panic disorder? 2. What causes it? 3. What will life be like for the person who has overcome panic attacks? 4. How is recovery accomplished?   Looking for a Cause Biologically oriented physicians have tended to attribute panic symptoms to problems of the nervous system. Jacob DaCosta, a Civil War physician, set the tone when he wrote, “It seems to me most likely that the heart has become irritable from its overreaction and frequent excitement, and that disordered innervation keeps it so.” This focus on biochemistry and physiology led to the development of tranquilizers.  Not long afterwards, Freud identified a form of anxiety that appeared in discrete, time-limited episodes. “An anxiety attack of this sort,” he wrote, “may have linked to it a disturbance of one or more of the bodily functions—such as respiration, heart action, vasomotor innervation, or glandular activity.” Nearly one hundred years later, this focus on the emotional component of panic has resulted in the psychiatric diagnosis called Panic Disorder.  More recently, clinicians have been exploring the role of disturbed breathing in panic attacks. As early as 1950, the physician R. L. Rice maintained that anxiety attacks were often the result, not the cause, of disturbed breathing; now psychotherapies for panic that include breath training are state-of-the-art. (Even so, very little training in this area is available to clinicians.)  Those who are familiar with yoga will recognize the classic body-breath-mind triad in these three points of view. But if a single cause for panic disorder exists, it has yet to be discovered. Instead, these three areas seem to interact with one another, forming feedback loops that grow larger if not addressed in some way.  For example, if someone is afraid of going to public places, then self-esteem plummets, fears increase, opportunities for relationships are limited, and panic-prone factors such as the fear of being labeled “incompetent” grow. Conversely, if the fear has been overcome, then self-esteem improves, fearful thinking is reduced, opportunities for relationships expand, and panic-prone factors are undermined.   The First Steps to Recovery We have already seen what panic disorder is and we have a general idea of what causes it. Our next step is to discover how yoga, coupled with clinical experience, can help panickers take the steps necessary to recover. The first priority is to manage the frightening physical sensations accompanying panic attacks, because they will make any other work impossible. Panickers walk on pins and needles attempting to avoid the sudden, uncontrollable symptoms of their disorder, and because these involve rapid arousal of the nervous system, it is imperative to find ways to strengthen the nerves and calm anxiety.  Arousal is subtle and is triggered in a number of ways, but the key to calming it is to learn how to “talk” to the nerves, how to communicate across the great divide between voluntary and involuntary functioning. Once the panicker has learned to manage involuntary reactions, the sense of being out of control is enormously reduced.  Yoga training can be particularly useful here, for yoga teaches us how to interact with the nervous system. If we want to soothe and strengthen it, we need to learn deep, relaxed yogic breathing. Regardless of the pathways of arousal, breathing is the language of nervous system balance and control.  To illustrate this relationship, imagine how you would react if you were walking along a dark street, and a pointed object were thrust suddenly into your back. You might gasp, then tense your whole body. Gasping is the natural reaction to sudden fear. If you discovered that the attacker was only a friend playing a joke, you might sigh with relief. Then your breath might become agitated as your fear turned to irritation. The way you breathe reflects how you feel.  This relationship between breath and nerves is a two-way street. Just as emotions create changes in breathing, so changing our style of breathing can alter the way we feel. Breathing is the only involuntary function that can be easily and voluntarily controlled. During times of panic, relaxed, controlled breathing will give us immediate access to the nervous system. This means that by changing our breathing, we can change the condition of our nerves when tension disturbs and frightens us. Then, when breathing is relaxed and the panic response has been calmed, the underlying anxiety can be gradually brought to conscious awareness for processing.   Learning Relaxed Breathing Practicing yoga is a good way to learn breathing skills, for it is a gradual process, often needing considerable support over a period of time. Yoga teachers quickly recognize when a student is having trouble (as is often the case with panickers), and they know a wide variety of alternate practices that will help the student master breathing skills.  The ultimate goal of breath training is to make smooth, diaphragmatic breathing a twenty-four hour habit. The corpse pose (lying on the back) and the crocodile pose (lying on the stomach with arms folded under the forehead) are both helpful training postures. Breathing with a ten-pound sandbag on the upper abdomen while lying in the corpse pose will help to strengthen the diaphragm and serve as a reminder to focus on the abdomen as well. In addition, it is helpful if the panicker learns to pay attention to breathing as often as possible during the day. Notice when the breath stops, notice when it jerks, for once an irregularity is obvious, it can be corrected. This practice not only fosters awareness, it makes the relationship between stress and breathing abundantly clear.  Panickers will find that diaphragmatic breathing not only calms the effect of arousal at the time of panic, it also provides an alternative focus for attention, allowing them to focus on their breathing instead of on the panic symptoms. As diaphragmatic breathing becomes a habit, the nervous system is less susceptible to panic in the first place. It usually takes about two weeks to become accustomed to the feeling of diaphragmatic breathing, and about six months of regular practice to make it a habit.   Special Problems in Breath Training There are a few potential problems that panickers may experience during breath training, and it is well for both student and teacher to understand them at the outset. The most common is that panickers have often developed a highly self-vigilant style that can lead to performance anxiety. (“Is it supposed to feel this way?”) Micro-managing has become a way of life to panickers. The teacher needs to be warm—reassuring but firm, letting the practice do the teaching, without becoming over-analytical. Breathing does not need to be perfect to be good enough.  Sometimes panickers carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies, and in these cases the natural unblocking effect of yoga stretches and postures can be helpful. Releasing abdominal tension while resting between postures promotes deep breathing. Covering the body with a blanket during relaxation and breath training can ease the feeling of being exposed or vulnerable.  A knot may sometimes form in the abdomen during panic attacks, making breathing difficult. As the attack continues hunger for air increases, but despite the need for air the panicker may feel that holding the breath is the way to “catch” it. Relaxed, continuous breathing, on the other hand, releases the unconscious tension created by holding the breath, and with practice it is possible to actually breathe through the knot that forms in the stomach during periods of anxiety. As increased awareness makes it possible to recognize tension early, it becomes easier to remain relaxed. To establish a smooth, unbroken flow of breath, the teacher might say, “When you come to the end of the inhalation and your abdomen has fully expanded, simply relax and let the exhalation begin. When you come to the end of the exhalation and your abdomen has contracted, simply relax and let the inhalation begin. Let each breath flow into the next breath by relaxing.”  Beyond Diaphragmatic Breathing Many therapists have begun to use breath training in their work with clients, but few have been trained to teach more than the basics of diaphragmatic breathing. Yoga, on the other hand, offers many additional breathing and relaxation skills that can help recovering panickers. Perhaps the most effective of these is nadi shodhanam (channel purification). As its name suggests, nadi shodhanam works to unblock tensions and resistance in the energy-conveying channels of the physical and subtle bodies, thus calming and strengthening sensitive nerves.  Normal breathing carries away wastes and brings in fresh energy with each breath. As energy is brought in, it must be assimilated and distributed efficiently in order to fulfill the purpose of breathing. That’s where nadi shodhanam comes in. The process of channel purification slows breathing down and focuses our attention on its flow. At the same time, according to yoga masters, this practice cleanses the subtle vessels through which physical and mental energy is passing. As these vessels become cleaner, energy moves with less effort, and its distribution and assimilation within the mind and body are improved. The result is reduced tension in the nervous system as well as a calmer mind.  Nadi shodhanam is not the only yoga tool for deepening relaxation. Techniques combining postures, breathing, and systematic relaxation kindle a sense of confidence in us no matter how much daily life seems to bend us out of shape. Exercises that relax both muscles and joints, as well as the 61-points relaxation exercise, lead further toward relaxed self-awareness. These techniques can be taught once students are familiar with the beginning practices. (For a detailed description of nadi shodhanam, see the Yoga International reprint “Balancing Active and Receptive Energies: The Practice of Nadi Shodhanam.”  Expanding the Recovery Process Along with breath training, panickers need to begin the process of resolving their fears. Sometimes they do this work on their own or with the help of friends and family members. Often, however, a period of psychotherapy is needed because the worries and stresses that initially contributed to the onset of panic require objective attention. Before treatment these factors are outside of the panicker’s awareness for some reason. As recovery continues, however, they become the proverbial elephant in the living room—there is no way to avoid noticing and dealing with them.  Often the stresses that are most difficult to recognize have to do with significant relationships. A question that can elicit awareness is, “Am I avoiding conflicts within myself?” As one panicker continued in recovery, for example, he was able to explain that his younger brother, who was in line to become a co-partner in the family business, was performing very poorly. Despite many signs to the contrary, the younger brother continued to imagine that he was doing well at his work. Addressing this problem raised many fears, for it would affect a complex web of family relationships. As a result, the older brother resisted speaking up and began having panic attacks instead.  There are many possible causes of panic attacks—stressful relationships, past traumas, fear of separation from loved ones are among the most common. One panicker’s attacks began when her husband’s promotion resulted in his being away from her and their infant twins at night. Pleased about the promotion, the husband had not been willing to see the effect it was having on his family, and the wife had not been able to express her fears directly. In the course of psychotherapy, this woman learned that finding practical ways to expand the scope of awareness and implement stress-reducing changes (ask for them, create them, or compromise for them in some way), although difficult, was the most satisfying process in the entire recovery.  There will inevitably be leaps forward as well as setbacks while recovery continues. This is natural, for the recovering panicker is learning to work with him- or herself in an entirely new way. Whether or not the panicker is undergoing psychotherapy, the psychological insights acquired through yoga can make a profound contribution to this process. A young student once remarked, “Yoga stands for You Oughta Get Aware,” because it provides such a wide range of tools to help everyone, including recovering panickers, do just that.  The Role of Meditation In addition to the body and breath, yoga works with emotions, mental images, thoughts, and relationships, seeing them all as part of an integrated whole. During meditation, for example, a normally disturbing image arising in the mind is greeted by a very different reaction than might otherwise be the case. Now the body remains rested and still; the breath sends messages of steadiness and balance to the emotions and nervous system. Though the image might seem upsetting at another time, now the meditator can witness it with equanimity. This neutral reaction allows time and space for the image either to be processed or to pass through the mind without disturbance.  What is more, meditation seems to pace itself; it allows the mind to gradually gather strength before bringing up the images that might prove most frightening or challenging. Trivia can be dismissed, but the thoughts and images that persist are the ones that have important consequences to us. For instance, suppose I begin to recognize a deep-seated unhappiness with my work, but at the same time I see no other way to support my family. This conflict haunts me, affecting my work and frustrating my family relationships. Panickers may force themselves to push such conflicts out of awareness because they cause a discord that seems unresolvable. Meditation will allow them to recognize it with less fear so that they can see their way through the problem.  Conflict Resolution Yoga psychology also suggests many techniques for resolving conflicts, including acknowledging and accepting the conflict in all its depth; recognizing the need for some kind of change; resisting the inclination to act out feelings or to do nothing; exploring alternatives; communicating with others without blaming them; accepting feedback from others; using discrimination in accepting or rejecting alternatives; surrendering to necessary losses; acting with determination; accepting outcomes with equanimity; working calmly on a problem even if a negative outcome, or no outcome, seems inevitable; and letting intuition suggest new possibilities. These strategies are derived from what in yoga are called the yamas and niyamas—the attitudes toward life that are the basis of all yoga practices.   Finding Refuge in Our True Nature Ultimately, yoga provides a philosophy that places the relationships between body, mind, and spirit in a new perspective. The Bhagavad Gita, a classic yoga text, tells us that “No one has the power to bring to destruction this unalterable entity [our true inner self]. . . . The body-bearer in everyone’s body is eternally undestroyable.” Anxiety arises from attachment to passing and impermanent things, but the more we are aware of our own true nature, the less anxious we become.  Yoga gives us a practical tool for working at this level of awareness—the mantra. This is a word or phrase that can guide and protect us. It serves as a focus of attention in times of panic, and it is a resting place for awareness leading to our true nature. Through its connection to the deep spiritual resources that lie within us, the mantra pacifies fear and encourages us to persist in the face of disturbing thoughts and upsetting emotions.  We cannot prevent life from changing. Life is inherently unstable. But during periods of change we can have the courage to identify and express our needs. We can look for ways to surrender gracefully to the inevitable. We can trust, through our experience of yoga, that the essential Self within us will guide us through the emotions of change successfully.

       I think that it's been important to take stock of my life and make peace with myself. I'm not very good at it. I'm an inpatient pupil at best and a stubborn mule at worst. Learning to live with myself as I am, not as I wish I were, is difficult. Yeah, of course, there are those things I can change, but one thing I have learned in this divorce, is that you can have change of habit forced on you, but given an inch, you revert to your true nature. You have to want the change and sometimes, I just don't know how much I really want it.       Like my weight and the way I look, which ReGina has so forcefully told me that I will keel over if I don't stop obsessing. I understand the obsession. My mother is, and my grandmothers were, heavy-set. I was a skinny person constantly being told to watch what I ate so I didn't look like them when I got older. Then of course, I married Steve, whose mother is anorexic and for whom food is a constant obsession and how you look is too. The woman is over 75 and weighs herself twice a day. Steve was always on me about my weight. The day he told me the 5-10 pounds I had gained made me unattractive to him, was the day I started my obsession in earnest. Six years of him calling me chubsie ubsie on top of my upbringing is a hard habit to break.  And I claim I want to have that lean strong body. But do I?  I want to break this habit of obsessing for sure. It's not healthy, and it is making me manic. I don't want to get depressed looking in a mirror. I don't want to be interested in a man and worry that he won't find me attractive as I am now, not as he'd like me to be. I will always be 5'3" tall. I will always be curvy. I will always be somewhat prone to pudge. And I am tired of fighting it all the time. I am tired of thinking "more, more and more" or "never good enough".  I have some ideas about it but I don't know how they will wash at the gym. I think the tendonitis in my arm was a call to arms (so to speak) that I was overdoing it FOR ME. I may be strong enough to lift all that weight but my 43 year old body is screaming "STOP IT!" So I will continue weight bearing exercise but not at that level. Some is good for your health all the experts agree. But I don't want to be in pain, have swelling behind my knee, have pain in my wrists from lifting heavy weights, be unable to lift my arm past my waist and be Charlie-horsed all the damned time any more. So do I really want the long lean thin look? I don't know if in my heart I really want it or think I have to have it to be loved. That's a dark corner I'm not sure I'm ready to look in.  I am increasing my yoga and meditation practice. I have been lax about it and I miss it but have done nothing to change it, focusing on the gym. It is too important to my physical, emotional and spiritual health to let it go any longer. I am not going to get crazy about "doing the pose" as it's not important to always do it deeply. It's important to have the form and the breath and to just be. In the moment. That's what it's about anyhow.  I am not going to stress if I am a little pudgy. This will be tough. I have critics all around me, namely myself and my mother. But I am not giving up the foods I love. I can eat them less. I can eat smaller portions. But I am not giving them up until the doctor tells me that it's life or death. Because giving them up without that ultimatum, I might as well shrivel up and die.  I am not giving up on a great love. I may never find it and I'm not going to panic about it. But I realize that 6 years has numbed me and jaded me and I can't be that person. I didn't like that person.  I have already given up on drinking cup upon cup of caffeinated coffee. As Phyll said to me today, I am my grandmother's granddaughter. But all that caffeine is just no good for this anxiety-prone woman. So, 1-2 cups in the morning, which I look forward to and then decaf or, as I've found I've gone back to my true nature, tea in the afternoon and evening. Without Singer, it just evolved.  I have got to stop the inner voice telling me to clean up my messes. That voice is Singer. I am not a dirty person. I hate dirty bathroom and kitchens, but clutter never much bothered me. Singer never let me have clutter. And I've been finding myself giving myself the business if my closet was messy or if I had the newspaper in the floor by the loveseat or if I have 6 pairs of shoes all over the house, and feeling guilty about it. What utter nonsense! What I have noticed, is how I've gone back to pre-Singer in that I am allowing the clutter.  I had dinner with Cheryl last Friday and she noticed my blouse and said something to the effect that it was very bright and cheerful and she wasn't used to seeing me in such bright colors and how much it lighted up my face. Pre-Singer, I was prone to rather bright clothing yet he basically culled my wardrobe. I bought the shirt before the divorce but wore it rarely because he hated it. Post-Singer, I am buying more fun clothing again.  Like I said, a habit forced on you will not remain. It's good to be me again.

       urlLink http://www.bravotv.com/   So, I've been chillin' today after doing laundry, cleaning bathrooms, working on the book update and etc. I'm eating lunch and watching this show on Bravo,  Things I Hate About You . This is what the website says about the show:    Sometimes true love can be truly annoying. Of course you love your partner, but admit it: there are a couple of things you'd change if you could. Maybe he drinks milk from the carton. Maybe she insists on singing, off key, on long road trips. You've wondered, "gosh, if only the world knew what I had to put up with...  " Wonder no more — Bravo has got just the series for you! Things I Hate About You is the show that lets couples document, for all the world to see, one another's most irksome habits and irritating behaviors. Armed with personal video cameras in and outside their home, each partner will capture their opposite doing the little things he or she does that drive them crazy. The video evidence will be presented to a panel of judges who will determine, once and for all, which has the more annoying habits. The more exasperating person will be required to grant one wish to their partner, who will also walk off with a specially-selected prize. Things I Hate About You is hosted by Mo Rocca (The Today Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) and features expert opinions from relationship advisor and author Jacqui Malouf.     So, I'm watching this show and I can certainly say that this couple are more than irritating! I would drown both of them. If I were the other one, I'd want to wait until my partner were asleep and then put him out of his misery. And how they don't do this to each other, I can not fathom. This couple were BOTH just miserable people. A better show? Them in 25 years to see if they haven't killed each other yet.

      What it Means To Be Young – At An Older Age  Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions.  You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as  your despair.  		--Samuel Ullman

      I have been suffering from migraines. Nothing new, I've gotten them for years but lately they are more frequent and stay to visit longer. This one has been since I woke up yesterday. I managed to get my hair done, go to Costco, go to the bank, go to Sprint and take care of a few things there and get the oil changed on the car. Then I napped. All night pretty much from 5:30 p.m. on. Sporadically getting up to take more drugs. I've managed without any so far this morning but I'm ready to start. I have laundry load #2 in washer. I need to get ready for the yard sale next week. I have to vacuum desperately and dust. And clean Sweetpea's litter box. And work on the book update. I want to do NONE of it. I am ready to lop my head off. I can barely think straight. And it doesn't help the anxiety. When I take something, the anxiety level goes down. Just from taking Tylenol. The anxiety must be from the migraine. Please God this thing should go away!
