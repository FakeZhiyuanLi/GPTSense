      a quote from a website   "originally known as Pixies in Panoply, they later shortened it to just Pixies"  http://www.geocities.com/caiproska/thepixies   funny how the website has "thepixies" in the the address  and on 4 seperate occasions he calls them "the Pixies", but it seems he's only doing it to make the sentence flow smoother, and dose not use capital T in "the" unless its the begining of the sentence.

      I have next weekend off and have decided to make the most of the opportunity to go to the snow. Anyone else keen? If I go on my own I will do the weekend option seen in the given link, or if other people are interested, maybe the self drive option. The car is always an option for transport and accomodation too! (in that case, the more bodies; the better!)

      Hi all,  I'll make this brief.  As I mentioned a few times in my previous xmas holiday ramblings, If you haven’t let me know that you are coming to Stuart's Point via the blog or my sfarrugia@gmail.com email address by August 1 then I'm assuming you aren't interested (although if you decide after the date that you'd like to come, I'm sure we can work something out, I just felt the need to draw the line somewhere)  So this is just a friendly reminder that time is almost up. I'm calling the park on Monday to attempt to book another caravan so that the current count of 9 people will all be able to sleep somewhere other than a tent.  So far those 9 people who replied to me are  1. Gav 2. Nicole 3. Troy 4. Marty 5. Kenny F 6. Kris 7. Geraldine 8. Tones 9. I  So if your name isn't on that list and you would like it to be. Blog it or email it to sfarrugia@gmail.com  Thanks

      This is a formal apology to Kris, Steve, Ken and Troy who's comments were deleted along with my uninformed question regarding the Bladeslo Cup (have a party on the spelling of that one Steve; I&nbsp;left it just for you!)  For anyone else wondering what I am talking about, or why a blogg was deleted; in short, I asked who was competing in the given sporting event, and the given nice young lads had a field trip on pointing out that it has only ever been between New Zealand and Australia.  My questions were answered, so I freed up the space and by doing so made some people un happy.  If necessary I will re blogg the exact same questions and you kids can post the exact same helpful responses received.

      This test does not measure your intelligence, word fluency or mathematical ability. It will give you some gauge of your mental flexibility and creativity. Only a few people have solved more than half of the 30 questions on the first try. Many, however, got the answers long after the test had been set aside – particularly at unexpected moments when their minds were relaxed. Some solved all the questions over a period of several days. Take this as a personal challenge. INSTRUCTIONS: Each question below contains the initial of the words that would make it correct. Find the missing words. Eg. 26 L of the A is 26 Letters of the Alphabet 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26 L of the A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Hello Group.  I've been informed that the cabin that was visited last Christmas holidays (Attendees were - Gav, Gez, Troy, Nicole, Kris, Marty, Kenny & Me) is available to us once again. But as it was last year, we are limited to 8 people, and the price has gone up (I can have exact figures next week). For those who don't know, the cabin is at a place called Stuarts Point which is about 1 hour south of Coffs Harbour.  The dates we can go there are  1st of January 2005 to the 8th of January 2005 . That's Saturday to Saturday.  I guess the best way to do this is to ask that  anyone who can make it to chuck a comment onto this posting, or to send me an email at sfarrugia@gmail.com. If I get more than 8 takers then we will have to go to an alternative holiday idea which is currently nothing, so suggest away.   I just need to emphasise that the cabin is  strictly limited to 8  (that is with 3 people sleeping outside in a tent, seriously)   ** IMPORTANT **   So if you are serious about going, get back to me before the end of next week (let's say the 1st of August is the cut off). If by the end of next week I have 8 takers or less then I will confirm our booking and we will be locked in. Considering how close we are to the end of the year we really have to sort this out A.S.A.P. to have any chance of getting a booking anywhere else for any time during the Christmas holidays. So I'm going to apologise in advance to anyone who can't give me a definite answer within the next week about Stuart's Point. Although keep in mind that if i get more than 7 positive replies then Stuart's Point is a no go and we find something else.    Cut off for Stuarts Point takers is 1st of August!   Apologies for repetition...

      iTunes music store reaches 100,000,000 legal song downloads. Now obviously I hate to be cynical, but Kazaa Media Desktop software claims to have 357,125,711 downloads of the software itself. So if each of these 357,125,711 people uses the software to download 2 songs illegally (that's being extremely modest), then that's 714,251,422 illegal downloads compared to Music Store's 100,000,000 legal ones. Anyone know what percentage of the 99c a song Apple would get? because US$1 per song isnt any cheaper than buying the physical CD version.

      Hey Guys Stayed an extra 2 days and drove through Kakadu - got back this morning alittle burnt and brown, but alot happier than when I left.

Hope to catch everyone up quick - anything on the cards? are we going back to the fiddler this saturday night? that would be cool - Almost as good as DJ Crikey. (top link :)         -Ken

      It has been confirmed I’m jumping out of a plane sometime after 8:00 Saturday morning, now in the event that something dreadful should happen, STAY AWAY FROM MY STUFF. Everything must be the way I left it (that includes my Good Charlotte poster), as a shrine for future generations to worship.  I also what to be taken to the Albion each weekend for a few drinks, Weekend at Berny’s style.  That is all, as you were.

      Some enterprising New Zealand schoolchildren have developed a cheap (about US$48) cellphone detector which they say is for use in deterring classroom texting, exam cheating, and unauthorised cellphone use in a variety of other environments (plane cabins, prisons, and so forth). We bet they’re really popular with their classmates now. At least they’re not out rustling sheep or something.   Source :   urlLink engadget.com

      WEll, like the title says - if you can read this, the site may indeed be of some use. If not, well, the alternative is obvious.  I also want to know: a) what is a contributor? how do they get this position? b) If you place a link - it goes to it automatically - at least Kris's thread did for me - so how do you comment on it? c) has this group of friends cemented itself in its nerdish behavior by creating its own website? d) will the photos from our Summer holiday be available some day in the near future?       -Ken

      Hi Everybody,  Hope everyone had a wonderful weekend. This Friday I will be going to the magnificent Punjab's Indian restaurant in the picturesque surrounds of North Parramatta. ETA about 7-7.30. This would probably be followed by a drinking session at everyone's favourite local pub (No smartarse comments, you know where I'm referring to). As usual, all comers are more than welcome although prior acceptance would be handy.  Kris

      So far the group compilation has 25 tracks, and I've gotta say it sounds pretty good.  Here is the progress top 5 for most popular year of release of each song  1. 2001 2. 1995 3. 1996 4. 2003 5. 1998  So far only one band/artist has been chosen more than one time.  The oldest song so far is from 1967, the newest 2003

      Hi Everyone.  The list is; Marty Kenny F Troy Nicole Kris Kenny McD Chris Gez Tones Gav Me  The dates are Jan 1 (Jan 2 for those planning a big new years) to Jan 8  That’s  Saturday, January 1, 2005 - Saturday, January 8, 2005   Here’s what we have booked.   1 cabin (sleeps 5)   2 tent spots next to each other (not powered)   The reason I booked 2 tent spots is because there is only 1 tent per site, so since we have 11 people coming and no-one has a 6 man tent I figured we’d get 2 sites for two tents. Also there is only one car per tent site, so that gives us 3 cars between 11 people. But I’m sure we can sneak another car in and park it in the outside parking lot.  Ok, now the important stuff   The cabin costs $600 for the week. That works out to $120 per person.   The tent site costs $189 a week (2 ppl) and $8 per night for each additional person. Soooo with 3 people on each tent site that comes to $81.66 per person.   Ok, so now all that is left is to decide who takes tents and who takes cabin. As you can see there is a considerable price difference between the two, so hopefully that will make the decision easier. The tent sizes are pretty big and we aren’t restricted to taking small tents, so hopefully 3 people per tent won’t be uncomfortable.  Just some additional information about the park for those who have never been there;    The cabin has a shower, toilet, fridge, tv, microwave, stove/griller  There are two shower/toilet blocks in the park, one is public and one is locked (each site gets a key)  The park is waterfront on the Macleay River, and it’s a short 5 minute walk to the unpatrolled Stuart’s Point beach, and a 5 minute drive to the patrolled Grassy Head beach.  There is a pub, a bowling club, a newsagent, a butcher and two convenience/petrol shops (there is an ATM) in Stuart’s Point. For more shops we can venture to Kempsey (40min drive), Coffs Harbour (1hr drive) or Nambucca (30min drive)  If anyone who has been there would like to add, please feel free.     Also I’ll just let you know I have already paid the $200 deposit on the tent sites with my credit card.  I guess decisions on the accommodation arrangements can be made when we see each other on the weekend.  Let me know if there are any other details you would like to know  Thanks Steve
