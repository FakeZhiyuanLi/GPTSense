      Life is sometimes like a good bolognese, sometimes you must just add more wine.  Still depressed but cooking. It helps. Pool is Friday!  Life must just go on as if nothing happened. Dungeons and dragons tomorrow.  Cooked a lot of bolognese.  We can just as well eat Italian. At least everyone is very excited about it.  Difficult to keep order at work.   I have never felt more alone.

      Life is just full of surprises.  It is like a very twisted kaleidoscope.  For instance, today I went to work with feelings of lost and regret and nothing to look forward to.  I walked out of work and I have a pool buddy for tomorrow evening! I can not wait.  I mist my favorite sport.  I also have started a Dungeons and Dragon club. And the first meeting is on Wednesday.  Just do not have a clue what we are going to eat for supper.  Speaking of which, the girls also invited me for another Chinese buffet evening.  I can so, not wait.  Also one of the best friend ever is going to come and visit one evening for a girls evening.  Cards will be read, nails will be painted.  Men will be discussed.  Fun shall definitely be had.   Wow, life is strange but it is unpredictable.  There is sometimes not pattern to life and must just be taken as it comes.

      And there was life.  Bang!! And what now?  No one has a clue what next.  Every one has one believe or another but no one really knows.  We do not even know if anything we do are worth it or not.  Maybe everything is just a pointless exercise. Maybe there is not goal for us.  Yes, Yes it is up to you to become what ever you want to.  Sometimes that is imposable.  Even if you put all effort in it.  Somethings work out and some do not.  It is not always up to you.  You do not always controle your own life.  You might think you do but that does just not work like that.

      Yes, feelings of self is apparently very important to yourself.  If you do not have good feelings about your self you can even end up mentally unstable.    That is all very well, but does society not try to make us all unstable?  Why must some kid's be picked on in school or why does one type of person not get along with others?  If you are another color,race, age, sex or anything different, then you are not excepted.  I personally do not understand why every person can not just make the most of everything and try to better things as a whole.

      Life, oh life, oh life! Is it good to be back ! PC's can really mess with a person. Just need to quickly say that if it was not for a very dear friend, there would be not change of being on the net again for a long time. Thank you so much.  Like I said previously, Life can through anything your way. Even illness of body and PC's. That is exactly what it was! And not always the best way to go. If body is ill, body needs rest. If PC is ill PC needs a lot of work doing. Some how that does not always mix! Especially not if you are working aswell.  Luckily the balance is yet agian restored. Juggling is some times just such a tricky busyness. It was a longer process but at least if is restored and that is all that matters.  There is a few strange other things that has happened in my life but I am still wondering if if I was not just in a part the bottom of a joke again. I just wish I could understand why it is such a big secret. But I will not get my hopes up that it really have been set up. The master plan might have already begun. There is a few goals now. We are making progress. It is wonderful if big problems are solved quick and easy.  Security is sometimes a very difficult thing to find.

      Maybe life is just a different episode every day.&nbsp; You never know what character is going to be in it and which not.&nbsp; Every day something happens.&nbsp; Even if it is something small.&nbsp; It is strange what leaves an imprint in your mind.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It&nbsp; is a very random &nbsp;script.&nbsp; You never know when there is a blessing and when something nasty is thrown at you.&nbsp; You have no choice of what is thrown your way.&nbsp; You might try and controls it but you can never be fully prepared.&nbsp; Although, it is better&nbsp; to work on it anyway just in case that is part of the plan.  &nbsp;  Absolutely anything can happen.

      Everything can not always go to plan and be good.&nbsp; But does it all have to go down hill and crap all at the same time?What has changed to cause such amount of unplanned damage and destruction.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There was a reason why there was short term insanity yesterday.&nbsp; Paranoia is sometimes a very good sign that some bad premonition is at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; That explain things. &nbsp; Well, must dwell on bad things.&nbsp; I will stay strong and it will not drag me down to deep.&nbsp; Altough it is very hard at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is ways out.&nbsp; Now just to find it.

       If you have nothing good to say, do not say anything at all.&nbsp; That is what my mom told me on many occasions and I think I will do just that for the moment.&nbsp; If I do not there will be to many swearing and ranting about things that will only put me in a mental institution.&nbsp; Hope to recover soon.

      The human thoughts process is always in some way calculated. The same can be said for sub-conscious decisions or thought processes. But the sub-conscious mind is very random. It is the sub-conscious where personality is form. Therefore personality is calculated.   Take for instance the dislike for cats. Quit a few people dislike cats but cannot give a reason. That is because they can no longer remember the reason why they dislike cats. If asked the reason for disliking cats they say they just always disliked cats. In the mean time they had a bad experience with a cat when they were a baby and cannot remember the experience. Or they heard years a go that cats spreading some type of decease. They have forgotten about the experience or of what someone told them about cats but it is in-printed in their sub-conscious. It is therefore that they have a dislike for cats. The conscious mind has already forgotten about the connection or reason for the decision but the sub-conscious has not. And that is why sub-conscious defies why you are what you are.  Therefore personalities or identities are calculated sub-conscious equations of experiences of the pass.    It is the combinations of all experiences that create the person.

      Life can sometimes, just out of the blue, turn in a good direction and everything just suddenly work out for no reason.  Strange if you consider that most of the time it is the opposite way.  Lost friends might just return. Sometimes they were not even really as lost as you thought they were, or as angry as you thought.  People that you thought does not like you suddenly stick up for you when you least expect it.    And even sometimes, a friend can bring in special chocolates to work for no other reason but to give you a sweet time.  It just go to show that life is one of the most random things that exist.    I concluded that sometimes you have to take it as it come. You have to see out the bad times and enjoy the good times.  You never know when it is going to start or when it is going to end.   I spoke to friend that I thought I lost forever. My D&D character is the coolest ever am going to go and play pool tomorrow evening for the first time in years. I know that my family is ok and happy. I made friend today and yesterday.  I went out to a very delightful lunch.  A friend brought the most delicious chocolates to work.  I am going to a beer festival next week and I think that bad thing at work got solved.   What can be more of a miracle than that?    Sometimes life is not out to get you.
