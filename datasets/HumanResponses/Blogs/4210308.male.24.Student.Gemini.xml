        Damn....   I missed a day...   It wasn't my fault, though...   tried to log in...   "Action Failed"....   sheeit!...   tried to keep my consecutive blog streak crackin...   at least I tried...   Just like my homeboy Edmark...   Yesterday we went to Friday's to celebrate his 24th birthday...   the plus was the Niners-Raiders game...   Raiders won...   but still....   Go Niners!...      Anyhow...   the universal plan for the birthday guy/gal...   is usualy to get them tow back....   you know...   Effed the eff up...   Ed kept it crackin...   2 hurricanes and a beer...   crackin until...   the Liquid Coca-een-a showed up...   "C'mon Ed, it's your birthday...   Just take it already!"...   20 minutes of coaching go by...   he finally says..."eff it"...   Shot in...   Shot out...   out in a spewing brown tone...   milkshake texture...   all over his brownie and ice cream cake...   at least he tried...   the worst part is that...   it was all...   Juvenile....-"Slow Motion...for me..."   i mean I was looking dead at the dude...   i'm pretty sure everyone else at the table was too!...   Karma's a beeya...   A couple a weeks ago...    my cousin Jr had his goin away party...   down at the 'Hukilau'...   Ed caught me gaggin off a sip of some Red Hook beer...   Nasty Sheeit, I tell ya....   He was crackin up at the time too...   You catch me gaggin....   I catch you yackin...   All good though....   Good Times...      Today...   Not much...   went to work....   Ooh!...   I'ma have Saturdays off for the rest of the year...   Aside from that...   kicked it with Steph today...   she came to the house...   had our "talk"...   we watched "Under the Tuscan Sun"...   Diane Lane...   Hott!...   It was an alright movie...   I mean I thought it was gonna be...   a sap of the mill...   full of cliches...   sob story...   chick flick...   the message I took from it...   and I always take messages from movies...   was something like...   "what you want and expect from life...   will come...   but not always in the way that you plan or want it"....   make sense?...   just watch!...   anyway...   tomorrow i'm off to prepay my Oly's...   Olympic Jordan 7's...   Not really feelin em...   but i'ma cop...   for fear of regretting not getting them when I had the chance...   I really really want...   the black/true red 7's...   but them bitches is like 160 online...   oh well!...   Liquid cocaine is bad...   Cocaine is worse...   brownies are the worst...

        Is it in every man's nature....   unless your're homosexual...   to oogle and google...   every attractive female that he sees...   I mean what is it?...   I work at a Costco...   you know...   everything in biggie size portions...   grocery/whatever the hell you need kind of store...   and beautiful women are a staple of the environment...   today...   mind you, I'm a cashier...   I had two sets of two stunners...   like..."Daaammmnnn" kinda girls...   come through my line...   one chick I knew from high school...   she got thick...   in a good way...   and all sorts of high school girls...   with their parents of course...   Back to School shopping...      I mean left and right...   was just...."Ooh"...."Damn"..."Wow"...   I mean I catch eye contact with a lot of these girls...   and that's about it...   partly because I'm shy...   but mostly because I have a girlfriend...   right now...   we're seperated...   if we make it to September...   that would be...   8 YEARS!!...   She's on some soul searching tip...   she needed space...   sometimes space is good...   sometimes space is...   lonely..      I guess that only time will reveal...   if me and her will get back together...   I give it about a 90% success rate...   yeah...   we've been through some shit...   but through the shit...   we've battled hard...   I mean I love her more than I dislike her actions and attitude...   She's a good girl...   who has never done me dirty...   I do miss her...   her mama's cooking...   her dogs..   her stepdad...   who looks like he would put murder on fools...   her lil brother...   reminds me of me...   her BMDub...   her stupid...   but cute songs...   and most of all...   her smell...

        So, I just get home from bowling....   not with my regular folkz...   with my co-workers...   The Pinoys....   the reason I decided to go out with these guys is because...   they gamble...   the very first time I went bowling with em...   I came up 65 bucks...   today, I lost 10!...   ain't that bout a beeyatch!...      bowling with these dudes...   sort of enlightened me...   I mean I don't speak any kind of Tagalog...   don't even understand it...   it was just trippin me out...   back in high school...   I woulda never kicked it with these fools...   you know,   the FOB stereotype...   I mean they ain't hard core TRU pinoys...   they're hip wid' it...   up to date...   so to speak...   people are just people...   that's the difference between me and you...      but anyhow...   tomorrow/today...   we get to rock Jerseys to work...   usually it's a collared shirt...   some stupid 2% promotion...   I hate when my co-workers do that part of the job...   they are sales people so to speak...   and I hate em!...   I think I'ma rock my Vick (Mike) Virginia Tech...   just cuz I got shoes to match...   Premium Trainer 1's...   I would like to...   Keep It Real...   and rock a Giants/9ers/Warriors jersey...   but the Giants one I got is like 10 years old...   in Ratty condition...   don't got a 9ers one...   got two J Rich Rewinds...   but their too...   the 'norm'...   Like Cheers...   never watched the show...   that's the difference between me and you...   eh, Vick it is!...   It's not what you rock...   It's how you Rock it!...   Ha!...   Peace out...   Pimpin'...

        So i'm looking through the font types trying to decide which one I should pick to write this here blog....   see, back in highschool i use to rock the "Times" font because it was the biggest font I had on my computer....took up most of the page space..   But what the hell is a "Verdana"?   Don't know but it is the biggest one...   thats just me....trying to find the easiest way to do things....   Anyhow or "who" or "wayze"...whatever you like...this would be considered my first blog...   I use to have a zanga or xanaga...whatever the hell it was called, but I wrote nothin but two entries and fell off...   so this here is my second attempt to hold a blog/ man-journal....diary?...I think not..      So..."It's not what you do, it's how you do it..."   the name of my blog...   why?...   just cuz!...   naw...was listening to this CD that my co-worker Evertino shot to me a while back...   It's this hip-hop/jazz mix....   some old stuff..   some Gangstarr, Dead Prez, Davina feat. Xzibit..Roots...   stuff in that nature...   you know that 3am creep through the fog type music...   but yeah, there's this one cut on there...   I think it's Bahamadia...some female MC...   excuse me!    a great lyricist    for those who wanna say I don't know shit about hip-hop   "Aww, whut choo know bout Bahamadia?"   Purists....   Fuck em'   but gotta love their dedication....   back to the title name...   I use to think that just doing what you do on a daily basis would be enough to keep you sane...   does that make sense?..   like are you gonna walk like a square-bear...or walk...   ...David Banner..."Like a pimp"....   something to that extent...   can't really explain it right now...   maybe on my 10th entry I'll try to break it down...   that's if I even make it to a 10th or 4th..      I want to be on some swol status...like my homeboy Jeff...   but I'm just so damn lazy...   but I did work on my shoulders today...      spoke to my cousin JR or "JRGeezee"..   see he just recently moved out to Puerto Rico...   4 years at optometry school...   I wish him all the luck and success...   and the finest piece of PR dunk-a-dunk(s) on the planet..   Yadadameen....!   Bay area lingo...don't steal...   Ever...
