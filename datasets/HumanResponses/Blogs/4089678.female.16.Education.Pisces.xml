      wow i dont have any clue whats going on right now...my mind is so foggy...i cant make since of my life right now..well donja i am gonna do something i hate and i am gona talk more about bert...yes let eveyone on here no my drama... well about 7 months ago i met a guy..he was 21years old (yea yea i know what ur thinkin)..well he was 21 and i was 15 at the time..and we knew each ther for 5months and then we dated for one month...and this is where i wish i would have listened to my gut feelin that...i liked him alot and that i could of possibly fallin love with him really fast and i did i fell for him really hard...and there for in the end i got fu**ed....the way things ended wasnt exactly how i wanted it to...but then again i didnt want it to end at all...but anywhos what broke us up is really something i am still confused about.... well i am gonna go into detail on this the best i can because i honestly am still confused after 7 months..i have sit there for hour going over in ove in my mind what happened that HORRIBAL night that changed the rest of my life...(Yea Im A Cry Baby So What)..well me and donja we have just got back from and feild meet for NJROTC and we didnt wanna be at home so we made up some lie and told my mom we where going with her mom to look for military ball dresses well my mom said fine be home by 10...SHIT thats where is gets bad...if it wasnt for that damn curfew...well we call our friend lida she is marks gf (marks berts friend) but so anyways we get over there and bert meets up with us..he has to go get his tatto and ask me if i wanted to go with him..i said yes of corse because since we had been dateing we really didnt spend much time together...and donja didnt care she stayed at makrs but the whole deal was i was suppossedto be back to marks by 10 to go home...well 12 rolls around i am leavein the tatto place with bert...we get ot marks donja is wasted..which doesnt help much... well anyways names get called shit gets slammed and the hole time i am just wanting to cry my eyes out becuase i had that feeling i shouldnt have left the house and the next day when i wake up..SHIT hits the fan my mom now knows i was with a 21year old...and my dad now knows to..and so does the hole world...wll anyways i try my best do make do with what u could to talk to ber well he didnt want anything eles to do with me...all the because the that small word MINOR...he had no problem with it befor but i can see where he came from with it...but i guess the thing that hurt me the most was the simple fact that he blew me off like i was a peace of shit that didnt mean anything...well a few months later i try talking to him he blows me off....and then a few months later i try again and he is just a prick and blew me off...well i have gave up since then its been 7months and my dumbass still isnt over the bastard...so honestly at this point i dont know really what to do about this i want him off my mind...he is out of my life but i guess the memory will always be there and thats a bitch... well anywhos this hole thing might not of really made any since but i thought i would try and get this out in the open..becuase i want it to all go away...i have really fucked up on this one..and i am honestly over the whole guy and dateing thing...because every guy is the sam and thats really sad..well i am not gonn read over this becaus it would take to damn long and im tired lol...well post me some comments and tell me what i should do

      Well here i am....they say to always try something new...well here i am...this is pretty new to me...there is so much i wanna say but so much i dont wanna say i dont wanna be juged by the things i put here...but i think i juge myself more then anyones ever has...i dont no why i do that but i just do i guess its a self esteem thing... my life has humor..horror..depression..and as any girl relationship problems..thats somehing i dont think anyone will ever get passed unless u find "Mr.Right"..im sure he is out there...just not in this life time..theses days seem that every guy is the same and i only after one thing if i have to say it then you need to be shot..men are pigs (No Joke)... the thing is i havnt been in many relationships..but the one i was in...was better then nothing...i wouldnt ever tell anyone this because i try to lie to myself about it because i dont want it to be the truth but the guy i was seeing about 7months ago i honestly saw myself with him for the rest of my life..but what hell do i know im only 16...they always say (I Wanna Know Who The Hell They Are  Because They Are Always Wrong)you know when you fallin love...well i know i fell in love...but getting off this subject..because its something that really wasnt dealed with the right way... Anywhos...well humor theres something i can go on and on about...i think im a fun person i love making people laugh and i love laughing at myself...i will try anything almost once...becuase there is no need to go threw life being serious about every little thing and being uptigh isnt to fun either..you only get one life live it to the fullest... i no i am jumping around alot and changing the subject but like i said this is new to me i am not a very organized writer but i love to write....i am a very strange person...but lets really just go to the basics about me i am ashley i live in navarre florida (Should Have Been The First Thing On My Page) i am 16 years old..when i get out of high school i have big plans for myself i want to go into the navy and be a nurs or something kool like that because i like dealing with people i just dont like blood or needles for that matter...i guess you can say my biggest goal of all is getting out of navarre i honestly dont like it here much...except for the fact we have and almost perfect beach (To Many People)..but i can always find another beach... and for fiends i dont have many...(Its Kinda Sad But Funny)..there is one person i know i can always count on to be there for me and go to anytime i want..you no who u are POOKY..(lol)but i guess i have a few oter friends but besides that i got people i talk to and i guess thats better then noting.. well this is the beginning of something new...and i have so much to say but i think it will need to wait fo another day...
