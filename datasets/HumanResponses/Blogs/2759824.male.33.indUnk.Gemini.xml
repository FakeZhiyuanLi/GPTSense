       urlLink    My first broken bone! ...and this is a good one... I broke the lower bone on my thumb, broke it into pieces, a few pieces. I was on my brother’s 4-wheeler riding a wheelie. I had the bike strait up and down and my hand must have slipped a bit and I hit the throttle and the whole bike just flipped out from under me and both me and the bike got tossed into the air flipping end over end. The bike came down on me and the end of the handle bars slammed into my hand. It was like someone smacked my hand with a hammer. It didn't really hurt but looked bad. My hand had a huge indent and the thumb was hanging down sideways. I thought it was dislocated so I pulled on it and moved it around but my hand still looked kind of funky and started to swell up so I spent the next couple hours at the hospital, got x-rays and found out that the bone was shattered so I have to go to an orthopedic doctor tomorrow. Hopefully it won't require surgery...

       urlLink    J ust came back from eating at the "Pho" ... a Vietnamese restaurant we usually go to once a week for soup and egg rolls (Mmmmmm.. egg rolls) Working late tonight so we went there for dinner tonight so that makes twice this week we've done the soup and rolls. Below Ed and Mike demonstrate the proper way to make love to an egg roll.

       urlLink    oh damn, those egg rolls are so good, a precursor to a great bowl of soup.  As Daisy said "it gets bettter each time I eat it", but the egg rolls  is there really anything better?  I am almost as thin as Ed in this picture, a little more to go...

      hahaahhahaha.  the best thing about working in high tech is being able to crank out code and drink a couple of beers.  No heavy machinery here.  The beer helps to relax and get things done.  Well we ran out of beers in the office, and Ed remembered he had a 30 rack in his car...Today was like 97 degrees out and the beers wree still warm when he took them in fromthe trunk of his car.   Now 28 are in the refrigerator and 2 are in our hands.  Ed just looked at me and said:  " You know the good thing about these beers?  They are getting colder.."  hahahahah

       urlLink    W e had a  little  cook-out with  urlLink lots of food  at Mike & Meg’s this weekend.  Mike bought a new grill and loaded it up with hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, steaks, six whole chickens!… After we finished eating more animals than you could find on a farm we started playing craps.  We usually play poker (Texas Hold’em) but this week Josh dusted off the craps table and brought it over to Mike’s.  No money was involved in this game, we just played for fun and I’ve never seen a game like it . . . We played for almost six hours and the dice only went around the table twice!  Just about every player had “thousands” of dollars in chips in front of them . . . if only we could have that luck with the real thing we would have all walked away rich!

       urlLink    mmmmm.  Saturday night's BBQ...well we had a great night of eating, drinking and playin craps at my house on Saturday night.  I started cooking on the grill at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon, then went and did a swim and a bike workout...8 o'clock the food was ready, and I was already drunk, the food came off the grill and everyone ate.  Then Josh worked as the dealer and 9 of us played craps until 2:30 am.    I was still drunk the next morning when I woke up at 10, so I had to postpone my long workout unitl 2:00, rode 56.72 miles, and broke the current D/M record for mile ridden in a day.

      Oh well, another week in the books...I didn't exercise as much as I wanted to this week, but I worked a lot more than I wanted to, which is always good.  I got another couple of pairs of flip flops at lunch today, I think I have a problem, but it is all good I guess.  I spent $7 for two pairs of patriotic flip flops, I will probally waer them inthe back yard all summer as I BBQ.  mmmm, I can not wait until diner tonight, I am going to cook hamburgers on the grill.

       urlLink    F ollowing the advice of Mike I have stepped out of the constrained world of shoes and socks and stepped into the new liberated world of Flip-Flops. I've always been a summer sandal wearer, but the old Jesus kickers were always a bit heavy and being made out of leather didn't breathe well in the summer heat.  The top pair is an American Eagle 100% cotton flip flop and retails for $19.50.&nbsp;  &quot;This flip flop has a rubber bottom with heavy-duty traction and a corduroy footbed that's padded for comfort. The corduroy upper features a suede detail for extra style.&quot ;  The bottom pair are an Old Navy $3.50 4th of July flip flop. &quot;Patriotic right down to your toes? These flip-flops are for you! Left foot bed features stars and right foot bed features stripes and Old Navy logo. Raised logo decorates rubbery thong. Sole measures 1/2 inch thick, with textured bottom for traction.&quot;

      Well, first off, we lost the soccer game. sux. It was our best chance of winning this session.  I tweeked my elbow pretty bad, so bad I felt I couldn't ride my bike to work this morning. again sux. Anyway, on the way home from soccer I buttoned Ed singing Counting Crows, and he was fixing Ronnie (poonbag's) computer.  I don't know what Ed knows that Ronnie dosen't know about fixing computers, Ronnie just seems really lazy (I love ronnie, I love ronnie, I love ronnie, ...).  Well they are painting my apartments black, so now I live in a black house.  I should look prety good when it is all done and we have shutters, I can't wait.  BBQ and poker this weekend, but first a couple of long days finishing up the upgrades to the interface..

      I went on my date last night with the ugly girl...It was a wonderful evening I had a couple of beers and pretnded to listen to her boring stories about her boring ass life.  The whole time I couldnt help but stare at the hot blonde across from me at the bar and  I wondered if being seen with the ugly hurt my chances with her.

       urlLink   This is week 9 of the 12 week " urlLink Gold's Gym Good Times 5K Series ".  It's a weekly running event every Tuesday night and each week they usually have some sort of themed competition for the race. This week was "Sandbaggers" night, it's where they handicap everyone's running time and then rate you by your time.  Since I'm in lousy shape and my goal is just to finish the race, I usually don't worry about my time - so since I tried tonight I ended up beating my best time by more than a minute and a half which when handicapped I ended up coming in "first" (not really first).  My time was 29:55 for the 5K (3.1 miles) not a great time but good for me...

      Diner Conversation:  Well we just got pizza from the pic for diner, and we talked about the stop on the way home from lunch.   You know when a new store opens up in town, I like to stop and get an idea of what the store is selling so that I know that I can stop there if I need to.  Enter "Snacks 'R Us", which just opened next to Dan's and the Korean BBQ.  We turned around cause I noticed that it was opened, and went inside.  What I saw I still can't understand, although I wonder if he can make money.  It was boxes of snacks, chips, broken apart cheese crackers into smaller groups of cheese crackers than you would get at BJ's for like $3.  I am really not sure what he is doing, but I hope he is successful.  He did say that he had 2 more stores in NH.  Ed thinks he must be selling drugs...

       urlLink    Sneakers or flipflops?   I could have arranged them artistically, but the fact that I have 5 pairs of flipflops in my cube made me want to send a picture to my blog.  The Painter might post a more artistic picture later.

       urlLink Jerry (the Painter)  won the sandbaggers night at the Lowell Good times 5k last night...I knew he was not trying over the past 8 weeks.  In other news, I was ".39" seconds away from clearing the 27 minute mark, damn I wish I ran a little faster over the bridge.  Anyway, I beat Adam's time which was 27:04, and now he is gonna have to come out of retirement to beat my time.  Either way congradulations Jerry on a great win.

      How different married life is from the single life.  Spent the weekend smoking ribs and chicken and eating an insane amound of food.  Sat around playing poker, carring sleeping kids upstairs and sleepovers.  Took out B and B for breakfast on Sunday morning.  Needed a long workout, so rode with dave 40 miles...

       Since Ed is a cool as Jesus - and I am the age of Jesus (33 yesterday) having a blog will now make me as cool as Ed (since Ed is cool and Ed had a blog) ... simple logic really (also assuming you think Jesus is cool).  Now that I'm getting old(er) and am trying to regain my youth, by copying the actions of someone more than 10 years my junior, I don't know if having a blog will make me cool or if starting a blog at the ripe old age of Jesus will have a reverse affect and will actually make me even less cool than before? …Sort of like wearing a toupee or buying a sports car during a mid-life crisis…       (I never realized how much Ed looks like Jesus until this picture!  Just give him a walking stick and a little lamb to carry around and he could be the next Messiah!)

      Since Ed is so cool and has his own blog, we decided that we will give up the last shred of anything that keeps us cool and follow what he was doing...     Well Dicecca was the first

       urlLink    The Single Guy - I have decided that after this weekend I am no longer getting a girls phone number after  I have been drinking so much that I cant see.....Heres the scenario I met this girl Saturday in Boston to watch Shakespears Much Ado About Nothing on the Boston Common.  I met this broad two weeks ago at some bar I cant even remember…..I though how bad can this chick be....so two weeks later there I am staring at this hideous old ass bitch...There we are sitting on a blanket waiting for this play to start in a hour...An hour...Fuck I didnt want to talk to this girl for another five minutes...So there I am thinking of how to get out of this desperate situation when thanfully I had to take a piss...There I am pissing in the port a pottie which was actually pretty clean for a port a pottie...In fact it was much more pleasant then the god awful bitch waiting for me on my blanket...Then it occured to me...I dont have to go back..Shit...its her fault for being so ugly...she should have realized once I sobered up I wouldnt find her attractive...So after a little debate with my concious..I  slipped past all the port a potties and bolted for the gate...I left her with my blanket and backpack...the only thing I would miss would be the combos an the bottle of water...I guess I wasnt a complete bastard it would be a long play and I am sure she would get hungry....
