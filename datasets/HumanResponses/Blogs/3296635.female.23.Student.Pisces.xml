Kalau perempuan tanya : You dah makan ke belum?  Makna Tersembunyi : Jom pi makan. Lapar ni!   3. Kalau perempuan kata : Lawa-lawa la baju kat sini, yek.  Makna Tersembunyi : Belikanlah untuk I.   4. Kalau Perempuan Kata : Rasa macam nak pening la.  Makna Tersembunyi : Tolong picit kepala.   5. Kalau Perempuan Kata : Letihnya hari ni. Mana nak masak, basuh kain-baju lagi...  Makna Tersembunyi : Kita makan kat luar jelah. Lepas tu, tolong basuh kain-baju sekali, yek.   6. Kalau perempuan kata : Kita lebih sesuai berkawan saja.  Makna Tersembunyi : I tak nak kat you. Tak paham-paham ke?   7. Kalau perempuan kata : I suka berkawan dengan you. You baik, memahami, bla bla bla...  Makna Tersembunyi : Hish... I rasa macam minat sesangat kat you.Rasa macam nak jadi awek you je.   8. Kalau erempuan tanya : You pernah tak teringatkan awek you yang dulu?

Aku kena berkorban. Habih, hangpa dua ekoq yang seronok.   10. Kalau perempuan kata : I tak kisah kalau memang betul you nak kahwin lagi satu. Asalkan you berterus-terang dengan I, bersikap jujur dan berlaku adil.  Makna Tersembunyi : Sapa kata aku tak kisah? Adil ke tak adil, aku tak kira! Langkah mayat aku dulu sebelum nak menikah lagi satu.    Well,get this thing from a friend and i have to admit that some of it is true i guess...but all...hhmmm i dont know...well women are complicated and sometimes we ourselves does not understand why we do or do not do things that is so obvious...but overall i still believe that women have reasons to say all of those things although they meant something entirely different.

						   well i do miss my friends xpecially the one that i'm close to...well i guess i miss da most is AZL.. because i miss talking and lepaking with her...it's just so normal being with azl and yet we will end up doing stuff that weren't plan...that is the best part...me and azl always end up doing something fun and spontaneous...for xample..during our stay in 1st college(holiday camp for romeo and juliet)that was last ramadhan and it was nearly 3am in the morning and since the college was quite lenggang sebab students semua balik kampung, suddenly both of us ware thirsty and unfortunely the nearest water cooler was infront of the guys block...and both of us malas aaa nak salin baju since dah nak tidor dah kan..but mengenangkan the next day nak posa, we had to go down and take the water...so we went down to the dewan makan 1st college wearing only our baju kelawar and i didn't even wear tudung...well althought it was stupid but the mission was for us not to be caught by anybody xpecially the guys...well nasib menyebelahi both of us since we managed to get the water and run back to our room before somebody saw us...we had a great laugh after that...although we nearly got heartattack when one of the cast (lady montigue) caught us while we were climbing up the stairs...but nasib baik aa pompuan and both of us buat muka selamber jer as if it's a normal thing and we've been doing it our entire life...hik..hik..thanks a lot azl for all the accidental memories!!!  I dedicate this post for azl since i already made a promise to her that i will mention her name in this blog...there u go one whole story bout u and me...miss ya lots!!!

						   yesterday when i went back from work, my beloved brother and sister were making karipaps..and the whole task from making the filing and dough was hilarious.My parents weren't at home as they were in Kl visiting my aunty in the hospital and as usual if my brother is at home he will definately create something or suggest something to cook and as always cha will agree to everything he says...anyway back to the karipap story...the filing was superb (seriously)but the dough ???!@$#!# well we put the flour+salt+water (that's the original recipe) +EGG and eventually the egg makes the dough very soft and it is hard to mould it...so we used nearly 1 packet of flour to make it hard heheheh...(btw the egg was my idea:)) and believe me or not they will keep on reminding me that the egg was my idea for the rest of my life...it took us about 3 1/2 hours to finally complete the whole thing... Then came the testing part...jeng..jeng..the filing was very yummy but then the "kulit" of the karipap was...MasyaAllah keras giler!!! tak der la keras sangat till tak leh nak makan but kalau compare ngan karipap org lain mmg ours waz the keras one aaa...my cousin was also there and she keep on comparing the karipap that we made with her mak tuk's...then again abang said cannot aa compare a spm level cook with a phd level cook...heheh what an xperience...overall i still think it was okay for novice cook like us but i wont try to make another karipap...not in 5 years time..ha..ha..ha the whole task was very tiring...  like i said before to cha and abang, beli jer la kalau nak makan sangat!!!

						   well monday come again and thank god it's gonna be my last monday here in penang port since this is my last week as a practical student...anyway i had a hard time getting up this morning..but yet again it was my doing ler...sapa suruh tido lambat kan...tuh ahhh tak larat nak bukak mata...actually i just came back from kl last night coz my aunty was admitted to the hospital 3 days ago and it was unplanned yg gi kl tuh....mama and abah still in kl coz they will be visiting my aunty and my toksu yg mmg tgh sakit and they have nothing to rush home since they dont have anything to do really...so kat umah tuh i've been staying alone but not tonite...tonite my aunty invited me to sleep over at her place(sebenarnya malas aaa nak gi but rather then making everybody worry bout me staying alone tak kisah aaa)  well back to the original story bout not being able to get up early...well since last nite i was alone at home, i decided to call hilya in klang and we talked and talked from 11pm to 2am...wheheh mampus aaa after this abah will naik angin when he sees da bill yikes!!!...tak kisah ler i planned to pay for the bill ler since dah guna banyakkan...but tuh aaa it was always like dat with hilya...we always will say "ok we better stop here if not the bill will be like hell" but the simple act like putting down da phone is soo hard to do when i'm talking to hil....we talked about everything from life as a student/working to current and past friendship to social life to family life to conflicks that we've been having and all sorts of topics aaaa and i always like talking to her...it's like magic whenever i talked to her...it seems that she understand me da best when it come to my frens(i'm not saying dat my other frens do not understand me but with hil and azl it's like they totally understand...sometimes i myself dont know me dat well..)well just wanna to say thanks a lot to hilya and azl for being there with me thru ups and downs( u guys are real jewel to me )

						   i just came back from a chinese funeral today...one of da staff's mother( to be specific..kak nor, one of my user yg will be using da system that i develop) passed away and today is da last day before da "perarakan" and da burning process...anyway,it was my first chinese funeral experience and defenitelly it was totally different with Muslims funerals...however da same thing with all funerals is the keadaannya...(everything seem so suram) well of course la kan org mati mesti aaa suram...heheheh....and benda yg before best we all semua dpt ang pau...(mmg chinese suka kasi ang pau)...tapi bukan duit but sweets.. i dont know da reason behind this but my guess would be to make the "living ppl" feel a little bit happier kot...:)  acctually i have a lot of question bout da funeral dat i wanna know...for example..da coffin...they will burn da body and take da ash and throw it in da sea..and what happen to da coffin? do they burn it down together with da body or they will keep da coffin and recycle it with other bodies? coz i looked at da coffin cam mahal jer and defenitelly berat....  and i noticed one thing...chinese kan slalu kasi bunga bila ada kematian kan..and i saw ler all those flowers...ingatkan they will put it there camtuh jer....actually they will take da flowers yg org kasi tuh and decorate da van yg nak bawak berarak tuh...patut la slalu jer van tuh penuh ngan flowers...  anyway, it was an xperience...and my deepest sympathy to kak Nor and da family (btw, kak nor is a chinese lady but married to a muslim man and she is a muslim lady now but her mother was a chinese still)

						   I got this from someone and i wanna share this with the rest of u hope it will inspire everybody man and woman!!!  Petikan buku Dr HM Tuah Iskandar al-Haj, "Membina Hati Bahagia",  (111-112) Suatu hari seorang profesor menulis ayat "Woman without her man is nothing" di papan putih dan menyuruh pelajar-pelajarnya meletakkan  tanda bacaan untuk memberikan penekanan dan intonasi yang lebih meyakinkan. Seorang pelajar lelaki tampil dan setelah merenung-renung ayat itu dia telah meletakkan tanda-tanda bacaan yang tertentu hingga  ayat itu dibaca seperti berikut:  "Woman, without her man, is nothing"  Usaha pelajar lelaki ini mendapat sorakan semua pelajar  lelaki. Dengan bangganya pelajar ini duduk dan di tempatnya dan  sorakan berterusan. Kemudian tampil seorang pelajar perempuan. Dia mengerling kepada  semua yang hadir di dalam dewan. Kemudian, dengan penuh yakin dia meletakkan tanda-tanda bacaaan yang berbeza hingga ayat itu dibaca seperti berikut:  "Woman! Without her, man is nothing"  Seluruh dewan menjadi sunyi sepi. Masing-masing tergamam. Akhirnya semua mata tertumpu kepada profesor. "Well", kata profesor itu."You can be what you want to be." Lalu  keluar meninggalkan dewan. Apa yang boleh kita pelajari daripada kisah ini? Banyak, tetapi kata-kata profesor itu yang menyentak. You can be what you want to be.  Maknanya daripada perkataan yang sama, kita boleh menjadi lemah atau sebaliknya. Pilihan pada diri kita. Kalau 'woman without her man is nothing' dibaca dengan nada yang selamba tanpa intonasi tertentu hasilnya berbentuk negatif bagi wanita. Tetapi apabila dibaca sebagai "Woman! Without her, man is nothing". Ia begitu memotivasi dan amat bernilai sekali.

						    Lessons in Logic                  If your father is a poor man,                 it is your fate but,                 if your father-in-law is a poor man,                 it's your stupidity.                   I was born intelligent -                  education ruined me.                   Practice makes perfect.....                  But nobody's perfect......                  so why practice?                   If it's true that we are here to help                  others, then what exactly are the others                  here for?                   Since light travels faster than sound,                  appear bright until you hear them                  speak.                   How come "abbreviated" is such a long                  word?                                   Behind every successful man, there is a                  woman.  And behind every unsuccessful                  man, there are two.                   Every man should marry.                  After all, happiness is not the only thing                  in life.                   The wise never marry.                  and when they marry they become                  otherwise.                   Success is a relative term.                  It brings so many relatives.                   Never put off the work till tomorrow                  what you can put off today.                   "Your future depends on your dreams"                  So go to sleep                   There should be a better way to start a                  day than waking up every morning                   "Hard work never killed anybody"                  But why take the risk                   "Work fascinates me"                  I can look at it for hours                  God made relatives;                 Thank God we can choose our friends.                   The more you learn, the more you know,                  The more you know, the more you                  forget                  The more you forget, the less you know                  So.. why learn.                   A bus station is where a bus stops.                  A train station is where a train stops.                  On my desk, I have a work station....                  what more can I say........

						   It all happen rite after we finished watching first concert of Akedemi Fantasia...i was lying on the bed with a book in my hand...as i just finished reading the first page of the book suddenlly i was in pitch black darkness...the electricity was out and all of my family members went out to the porch sbb kat dlm umah tu panas....and most surprising thing...our house jer yg blackout and the neighboring houses ada jer elektrik...so my aunty called ler one of her frens(or somebody who worked in TNB) and consult the problem to him...  as we were waiting for the TNB man to come, we were restless and mama sugested we eat ice cream...so apa lagi we all go to our uncle's kedai runcit and each of us came back with ice cream in hand...just imagine eating ice cream in the dark (and i could not even see the colour of the ice cream) at 1 o'clock in the morning...while chatting with my cousin and sistah...  after dat my gigi semua sakit rasa cam ngilu and dat was the first time i feel that way bila makan ice cream.. ye la selalu tuh tak lak rasa camtuh...anyway the TNB man came and i donno la what he did but he surely had done something coz the electricity was ok after dat....but yg paling kesian is my uncle ler...dah ler kena tunggu we all abis tgk konsert akedemi fantasia baru tv tuh dia bleh konker...alih2 baru jer bouat 10 minutes tgk bola terus jer tv padam..heheh terpaksa ler dia gi kedai kopi yg ada kat depan umah sbb nak tgk bola...but once the electricity dah ada balik dia balik tgk kat umah....hah..ha.ha.pity him...

						   yea..yea...after so long been waiting for this movie to come out..finally i get to watch the movie last night...i went with cha and abang and we did not managed to catch the show at 6:30pm instead we went for a 9:30pm nyer show...heheh thank god gak ler we went with abg..kalau tak gerenti mama would not allow us to go..hee(biasa aaa kat umah ada cinderella time)  anyway, after seeing da movie i somehow was a little bit dissapointed with the movie...maybe becoz this is the first harry's movie that i read before seeing the movie first...(socerer's stone and chamber of secret tgk movie dulu then baca buku dia)...i find that there are a few events in the book that to me quite important but the movie left it out...i do not know bout u guys who did not read the book, but to me if u guys really wanna enjoy the story u guys should go and read the book and u will be more satisfied wwith the storyline...above all i still think the movie is quite superb(ye la kena la kata gak coz harry potter is like one of my many favourite story) well kalau nak kasi bintang, out of 5 stars i will give the movie between 4 to 4.5 stars...  one more thing, my favourite character in all harry potter's books is in this story but somehow to me i feel that the movie failed to show the true character of of Sirius Black...and i feel that they also failed to potray dumbledore as a wise wizard( dont get me wrong...the dumbledore in the movie was wise...just wasn't wise enuff...)but the acting for harry, ron and hermoine still outstanding..  i guess i said enuff bout harry potter and i would like to welcome any comment from anybody bout the movie...for my frens yg belum tgk harry potter tuh,go and see the movie ler...best!!!

The UPSR takers are the twins (Akhbar and Abidin) and Fahmi (the 3 stoogies and believe me when the three get together alahai mcm nak pecah rumah) and da 2 PMR takers are Fatin and Syakir (yg ni pulak nampak ja pendiam but when they start to talk, non stop and syakir is da pak lawak guy...dah la muka cam Mr Bean)hope they excell in their studies and get good grades for da upcoming examinations...man..i miss studying,i miss da exercise books,i miss school life,i miss da sound of school bells,i miss taking tests(i never thought i will miss this part),i miss da blackboards and lots more but most of all i miss all my friends...lots of love..."pEAcE brOthEr"
