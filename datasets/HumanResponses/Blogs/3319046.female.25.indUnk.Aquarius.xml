      ..And wilt thou have me fashion into speech The love I bear thee, finding words enough, And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough, Between our faces, to cast light on each ?-- I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach My hand to hold my spirit so far off From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof In words, of love hid in me out of reach. Nay, let the silence of my womanhood Commend my woman-love to thy belief,-- Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed, And rend the garment of my life, in brief, By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude, Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief..  (Sonnets from the Portuguese, by Elizabeth Barrett Browning)

      i'm not alone, but i feel lonely, here in the office the deadline is over everyone is watching bajaj bajuri  actually i love the show  but i've no idea why i don't this time perhaps, it's my feeling for you that cause me this way the feeling of longing you,  the desire to have you next to me, to watch the dimple on your cheek that shows up everytime you smile,  to feel your hand touch my hair just like you do everytime we meet,  to hear your lazy but sexy voice on the telephone but, hell you just ignore me now well, you're still funny on the phone joking around and making me laugh so hard but that's all no other attempt you do to show me that you want me too how can you do this when you said that you want me,  yesterday, last week, last month, and your whole lifetime? is it a man's behaviour to be such a pain in the ass, to let a woman wait for something so bizarre?  i admit,  you succeed in blowing away my mind,  creating a thunder in my heart everytime i get next to you or think of you so, what now?  it's been a long time that i don't feel this crazy things inside me, the feeling i get when i read your sms  or watch you taking images with that heavy camera i don't wanna ask a lot but i just want you to know that i really miss you..

      Sex and The City's Miranda Hobbes once said (I forget the exact words), to get over the man you love, you need half of your time being in the relationship with him. So, if your relationship lasts for 2 years, it means you will be able to forget him in one year.  In my case, I've been in that relationship for 3 years. And we broke up almost 2 years ago. I'm supposed to get over him in 1,5 years, right? But, what now?  Well, perhaps the pain is not that hurtful anymore. I even had some boyfriends and a couple of flings during that "healing" period. But the feeling of longing him could not get easily erased from my mind. He's like Carrie's Mr Big for me. I can laugh with my friends, flirt with some men, do the jobs at my best, but when I'm alone, he always keep on coming back to my mind.  It happened yesterday. The whole day, all of a sudden, the memories of him depicted inside my head. It all started by "Somewhere in My Broken Heart" song. I usually don't like that song coz it's so cheesy and mellow. But yesterday, my mind started to blow away when this song was on the radio.  All pictures of me and him together were projected in my mind. And it's added by Carole King's "Now And Forever." Oh shit! My eyes started to burst into tears. But I tried to hold them coz I didn't wanna people to know this. I always keep my pride high by saying that I've already forgotten him.  At night, MTV played 311's "Love Song," and it made my mood fall again. Furthermore, there's Alanis Morisette concert on ANTV. The song, "You Oughta Know" really reflected what I felt at that moment.  Hear this:  ".. You seem very well Things look peaceful I'm not quite as well I thought you should know Did you forget about me  Mr Duplicity  I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner  It was a slap in the face  How quickly I was replaced  And are you thinking of me when you fuck her .."  Ouw..!! Love hurts, and it does me very well.  Perhaps, that's one of the reasons that makes me so cautios and alert whenever I meet someone so charming and attractive. I'm afraid of falling in love, if in the end, I am hurt again.   It's silly, don't you think?  Now, I always say to myself to perceive relationship as a game. Play it like a man--don't involve your feeling at all, it's only for fun-- so you won't feel hurt anymore.  Simple? Not at all.  But at least, I have the natural ability to camouflage my true feeling with some pride and confidence. Therefore, nobody will know it!

      Tante: "Kapan nih nyusul?" Gue: "Doain aja deh Tante" (the conversation taken place at my cousin's wedding, last week, and it's repeated again and again by so many people) Huh! Kenapa sih orang Indonesia selalu sibuk ngurusin private life orang lain? Gue selalu aja terpojok dgn pertanyaan2 seperti itu.  Kalo cuma ditanya ke gue aja sih gpp. Tapi kalo ditanya di depan muka bonyok kan, koq nohok banget ya? Gue gak tega ngeliat my favorite persons in the world sok tersenyum, sambil ngomong "jodohnya belum dateng" as an excuse, padahal gue tau, deep down inside they're hurt.  Well, mau gimana lagi dong? Gue juga gak mau maksa, emang belum ada yg cucok.  Lagian, gue belum bisa bayangin aja married sekarang. Di tengah2 pekerjaan yang numpuk, liputan yang segambreng, dan kebahagiaan gue being a single woman.  Yes, I'm happy being single! Banyak hal yang bikin gue ngerasa blessed being single rite now. Contohnya beberapa hari lalu. Waktu itu, gue naik taksi bareng2 sama 3 temen yang udah jadi ibu2. They kept on complaining about harga susu yang mahal, susahnya cari waktu buat diri sendiri--even hanya untuk gunting kuku or korek kuping,can you believe that?mungkin kd or titi dj teutetup cantik dgn french manicure mereka krn punya pasukan baby sitter sendiri--atau pusingnya ngatur waktu buat liputan dan keluarga.  Coz I'm the only single woman in the cab, ibu2 ini ngiri abis2an ama gue. Mulai dari betapa enjoynya gue belanja-belanji, ke salon seminggu berkali2, dugem semau gue, fitness, nonton konser, lirik cowok kanan kiri, dan hal2 lain yg hanya bisa dinikmati oleh single women.  That short conversation adds one more entry to my "unbeneficial things of getting married" list. Apalagi, dua orang temen kantor gue juga ada yang lagi hamil dan gue ngeliat mereka dgn perasaan kasian. Dateng pagi, pulang malem, belum liputan ke tempat2 ajaib seperti Kejaksaan, Pengadilan, Polres, dll. Capek banget deh kalo harus ke sana-kemari dgn membawa "gendang" di perut.  Emang siy, getting married ASAP pernah terlintas di pikiran gue. Waktu itu, yg kebayang cuma enak2nya. Bisa berdua sama pria yg gue cintai eternally, bisa having sex legally without having to feel guilty all the time, bisa punya baby yg lucu2, bisa nyenengin ortu, and so on, and so on.. Tapi makin ke sini, gue makin mikir2 ttg marriage. Apalagi setelah gue putus sama cowok gue dan keep on jombloing until now. Terlanjur enak kemana2 tanpa aturan, akhirnya I keep asking myself, "Am I ready for a commitment?"  Imagine, you have to spend your whole lifetime with the same persons, including his awful habits, demanding family, snobbish friends, etc. It's probably funny to hear, let's say, him singing "cucakrowo" in the toilet everymorning at the start. But what if you have to face it everyday? It will be irritating, rite? Apalagi, I believe, marriage is not a game. Once you do that, there's no chance to turn back. Marriage itu sakral karena lo udah berjanji di hadapan Tuhan. So, there's no permission to fool around, flirting sana-sini. Ini dia yg jd big problem. Can I stand living with one person only for the rest of my life?  Probably, I say this because I've never experienced the so-called "true love." Also, I always look something from the darkest side. If a couple can get divorced, why do they have to get married? Belum lagi ditambah dgn urusan mertua yg gak abis2, tetangga, anak, rumah, mobil, dll. Waduuh..pussyyiinng.. Makanya, sampai saat ini, gue salut banget buat temen2 gue yang dengan gagah berani memutuskan untuk menikah, especially getting married in their 20's. Selama ini, yang gue jadikan tameng untuk menghindar pas ditanya2 ttg marriage adalah status "jomblo" gue itu. Padahal sih, kalopun gue punya pacar, gue juga gak yakin, gue bakal berani memutuskan  untuk berkomitmen dgn orang itu sekarang2 ini.  Anyway, mudah2an someday Allah SWT memberikan keberanian itu ke gue, plus tentunya, jodoh yang terbaik in a perfect package. Ssst.. inilah isi doa gue setiap sholat. What an irony if compared to my perspective of marriage :)

      I heard this song every morning from my sister's CD  But I just found out the singer and the song's title last Friday  And you know what?  I feel like crying when I saw the clip  A sad and absurd feeling suddenly burst in my heart  I don't know why I did that,  but perhaps it's because I've got no one to sing this to Such a silly thing to do, rite?   Love Song by 311 Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am clean again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you
