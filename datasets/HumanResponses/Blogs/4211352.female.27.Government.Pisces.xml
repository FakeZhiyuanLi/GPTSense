      Hey what is happenin to the weather? I want some hot sunny days again so I can sit in my garden...I want to have a BBQ... Oh that reminds me - Marie if you are reading this..did you mention a BBQ at yours this weekend? Is it still on and if so will it be inside??????  Got my hair done last night. Had it highlighted and cut. The good thing was that I only had to pay £25 (normally costs about £60) cos I chose to have it cut by a trainee (She's cut my hair before so it wasn't a risk!). Soooooo with the extra cash I bought an intensive conditioner which cost....£12!!! Oh dear! Women's logic eh? Plus when I got to the hairdressers she asked me to come back in 20mins cos she wasn't quite ready. I went to Wilkos and spent £20 on rubbish (not literally rubbish - just stuff I didn't REALLy need like stuff to clean the car etc) ....  When I got home from hairdressers I felt really really sick. My stomach was churning and I had pains in it. David thought maybe I had eaten something that hadn't agreed with me but I haven't eaten anything different to normal. The only thing I did different yesterday was drink 2 litres of water. And other than make me go to the toilet about 20 times that can only be good for me can't it? Oh well, I feel ok today so its nothing too serious..  Oh I've just realised ...... it's FRIDAY!!!!!!

      Well it looks like all the early mornings, lack of sleep and junky food has caught up to me.  I feel (and probably look) wrecked!  So.... I have not been to the gym these past two days and have instead spent the extra time snoozing in bed.  Getting my hair done tonight as my greys are poking through - aaarrggh!!  I like getting my hair done - its really relaxing (except for the bit when you feel you should make small talk with the hairdresser and can't be bothered).  The weather is depressing isn't it?  Grey morning, raining, humid..... oh dear!   Well at least it is nearly the weekend!!!  Nothing to really talk about at the mo so maybe I'll catcha later...  Now what shall I get for my lunch today?.....

      Well we didn't end up having Chinese last night after all cos we went out for a candlelit dinner for two in the Botanic Bistro!!!   We were both shattered and so nearly didn't go but I am soooo glad we did cos it was lovely.   They have opened the upstairs of the restaurant now and so there is loads more room.  We got a bottle of house red, starters, main course and finished with coffee and mints  (we skipped the pudding although we did ponder over the menu for a while contemplating.  I'm glad we didn't have any though cos it would have been like that guy off the Monty Python sketch who eats and eats and eats and then has a "wafer thin mint" and explodes all over the place!!!  We were just nicely full...).   We went home after the meal and put a film on but I was too tired to watch it all so I went to bed before the end.   All in all it was a lovely and unexpected night out.  I would like to go to the Botanic Bistro at least once a month until I get sick of it and try somewhere new....

      1.00pm - 4 finger kit kat (yum)  Chinese tonight. All I did was ring Dave and say "What are we doin tonight?" and then then was a small pause and a snigger and he said "excellent!" and we both knew that we had just agreed on Chinese takeout - its great bein married and know what each other is thinking innit? Bad on the waistline tho..... :o(

      Wish I was in bed......  I am soooooo tired which isn't surprising since I didn't go to bed til 12.45am and then got up at 6.00am to get ready for the gym. Marie is on an adrenaline rush but I am drnking my first cup of coffee of the day, my eyelids are closing and I have a mouth ulcer which means I can't smile without inflicting pain to the right side of my brain (!?!). I must look like a right miserable old codger. I must be sending off vibes cos no one is talking in my office...  'Nimble' sandwiches eaten - 9.45am  Apple eaten - 10.00am  No lunch remains......  Will be starving later now - oh dear!  Weekend was ok, in fact it was pretty chilled actually. Friday night Dave and I just cabbaged in front of the tv, but Saturday Lou, James, Hannah and Bob came round and we watched Garfield and played Mars v Venus game - always good for an argument!!!! I love introducing couples to the game and watching them giving each other daggers from across the room (the looks say "Just wait til we leave - u are soooooooo dead mate"). Mind u Lou and James seem pretty chilled - Dave and I were always the worst!! Sunday night Marie n Craig and Sue came round to talk about going to Berlin. We sat in garden in dark and let mozzies feast on us whilst we ate my scones (strawberry jam and black cherry jam with dream topping - Craig is partial to my black cherry - hehe) and Maries spicy cakes ...oh and chomps of course.  Need to go and phone my dad now to check he can go to my house and wait for Eddie Blackburn to come and fix skylight. Hope it doesn't rain cos he might slip off the roof.

       I only started my blog yesterday and already there is a recurring theme...food! I am STARVING already.  What is wrong with me?????  I have eaten my sandwiches and its only 9.30am...      Plus I'm thirsty so I'm gonna start drinking more water like Marie.      Do you think I have an alien inside me who needs feeding?  I've always been the same.  Eat fast and eat A LOT.      Went in the pool this morning after working out for an hour in the gym.  I didn't do much swimming tho cos I can't swim very well and I get panicky (the depth of the water was only 4ft.... but people can drown in an inch of water can't they? - I'm sure I heard an incident of that happening..).  I need to take lessons cos if Phoebe and Gregor can do it they I'm sure I can learn.      I am sooooo glad its Friday!!!!!  Got nothing planned for weekend except for Sunday evening when Craig n Marie and Stu n Sue are coming round to discuss going to Berlin in October.  Will try and have a German theme - german beer, maybe some apple strudel, Schindlers List?  No maybe skip the film cos I tend to cry throughout and its got to be a 'jolly jolly jolly' evening not a depressing one....  I think Andy mentioned in his Blog that one of the most poignant scenes is where Schindler breaks down when he beats himself up over the fact that he could have saved more Jews.  I totally agree.  Dave and I always have tears streaming down our faces when we watch that scene (Dave will kill me for sharing this information...but I don't care I LIKE the fact that he's a BIG SOFTIE!!)      Think I'm gonna go home at 3 or 4pm today. Might sit down and read a book or colour in.... (DON'T ASK)

       I am sooooo glad that I am starting to get more active lately ie. going to gym, running etc cos I have been living off takeout and junk food these last few days....      I had Chinese takeout from Sun Wah on Monday (really disgusting - never go there...),    another Chinese on Tuesday (this time from High Park - a safe bet) with Ste and Nat while we watched Dodge Ball with Ben Stiller (not actually WITH him but..yeah u know what I mean)    and then had a KFC after going to see I Robot at Vue with Craig n Marie.       Wow that woman off 'You are What You Eat' would be traumatised if she examined my poo (she does this if u have ever watched the programme...honest! She described one huge woman's excrement as looking like small florets of cauliflower dipped in chocolate.... eeewwww!!) and she would be giving me a stiff talking to - as would my mum if she knew. She is always going on about me eating my greens or having more oats or taking some supplement or other - as advised by the guy in the health section of Woman's Own....       Anyway, Dave and I have decided to chuck away all the rubbish out of our kitchen cupboards on Sat and do a major shop for healthy grub. We have resolved to make the effort to make meals rather than just grabbing snacks and fast food. I say 'we' but what it boils down to is 'me'. Marie says that women have one breast for cooking and one for cleaning (is that where I'm going wrong? I tend to use my hands...). I told Dave this but he says I have one for nagging and one for moaning... I think he was hungry. I had just come back from a 1 and a quarter hour run with Marie (we had got lost and nearly ended up in Tarleton...) and was sweaty and tired and needed to get ready for going to the flicks. Needless to say when he said "What's for dinner?" he received a curt response...Poor Dave! I am a rubbish wife...but I can make great scones with jam and cream/dream topping (and if you tell me your jam preference I am happy to oblige!! The jam of the month is Black Cherry which makes Craig's eyes glisten with joy).      Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry. I have already eaten my lunch (had it at 8.55am...I get really hungry in the mornings after going to gym and/or cycling to work and it is too tempting to see my sandwiches and NOT eat them..) so I have arranged to go to Ronnies with Marie for garlic bread and wine. The healthy diet starts Monday.....
