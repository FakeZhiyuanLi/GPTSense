      The second that I am living in now, is that I know the moment is filled with Christ guiding my path. I told myself today I will let myself be submmited to Christ, nothing else. If there is any doubt, I remind myself, what is there to worry since you know you are being watched by the creator?  I shall walk in faith.

      Place: work station  If there is one thing that I tell myself writting this, I must understand that I am writing this, not to glorify myself. I am writing this to reflect a mirror to myself, a mirror that non can see but myself. I am writing for self-inspection. Writing, so I can live to be a better man.

      At this point of time, my mind is fully blank, but I know; I know I need to get this all out before I let my demons in me engulf me again. I guess, I can be termed as what a phycologist called "a nut case". To them, Im a patient. And to others, I am just another million faces who refuse to admit that I am sick.  People check into institution when they are ill. But not I, I dont have that luxury. Its me and my demons. No one can save me, not even God. God, from I understand, can only save if I let myself save by him. Being a sinner, that stray so far I have given up the thought to be save. Perhaps you can quote; "God allows U-turns" but I seriously doubt that. I have went so far with the demons in my mind tha tI seriously doubt that I can make a U-turn again. Even if I want to, my soul wouldnt allow me to. I have fallen, in what you can so called; getting used on being fallen.  Its Sunday today, I set my timer and woke on time today, wanting to see the last institution that would save me; church. But I struggle. I struggle. I struggle the thoughts of it. I struggle the possibility of me getting saved by his grace again. It has been a while since I last set foot into a church, and I remember the last time that I set foot in I walked out with my soul lifted. Yes, my soul was lifted all right.But I let it down again because I couldnt keep up with the demands on being perfect. I am not perfect, and I cant be perfect. I struggle to be perfect. I wish I am perfect so things can be okay, but I cant. I wish I can be perfect so I wont lose her. I wish, I wish. I wish I can walk my life again so I can know the mistakes that I made, so I avoid it. I wish I know how precious she was to me, so I wont take her for granted. I wish I can be a sinner who accept grace, to understand love. I wish I understand being a God's man is not the point on become perfect, but to accept the love on you... I wish, I wish...  ...  Yes, how I wish.  I know I will go nuts if I dont sort this demon out. I missed church today, I guess I want to miss it. I am, just not ready to step into it. I am not ready to face him.So before I face him again, I am going to sort this demon in me out. Today.

      You can say I am hitting a bit on my hyper side when I am wrting this. My ears kept hitting this recent new love I found through Yahoo music, King of convenience " I wanna dance with you." In love with it catchy tunes and the voice. It sounded like like a dance tune, minus its bass. Something is definitely wrong with my bladder, this morning I had nothing but just a cup of tea, and I am going to the gents like crazy. I am having serious thoughts that on that I may be suffering from something, perhaps some urinary or kidney infection or something, anyway, Im ending this here, going to check out how this bloh looks like.
