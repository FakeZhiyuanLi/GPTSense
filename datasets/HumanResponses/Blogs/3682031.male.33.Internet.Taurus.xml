      I'm thinking of getting a digital camera, one with a rechargeable battery and a gig capacity of storage or memory.  I was thinking it would be good to date and stuff, but, really I just need a few friends.  getting married having kids etc. is a lot of hastle that I'm not looking for.  Maybe a very casual female friendship in the future would be good.  I'm still deliberating on taking the job at Miracle Software Systems, I got another interview lined up at Chrysler this wednesday that will seal the deal.  If they like me and I like their project I will go with Chrysler, otherwise I will go with Miracle..

      I've been driving my old truck for a while.  for free basically.  its paid off and I am not paying for collision on my insurance.  It runs fine, but, the battery is going low each morning.  So, I am in the process of driving it every four hours to keep the battery going.  I will take it down to 'belle tire' tomorrow.  these things are troublesome, especially when I will need reliable transportation to my new job.  cross my fingers I'm able to hold it together for the next two years.  I suppose I need to relax, express how I'm doing, get out more, and get a girldfriend.

      well I think I mentioned it earlier.  that I got a job.  Its with a consulting company that does its primary business with ibm software.  The software industry is moving to be able for large systems to communicate with other large systems.  This is were ibm and its technologies I will be learning fit in.  its a 2year gig which is a formiddable contract duration.  The longest I've worked continuously is about 2 years so this will be a stretch.  hopefully it will be broken up into short work contracts of 6 months.  I am configuring a java j2ee container, tomcat, so that it uses a datasource, or jndi, to lookup database connections without success so far.  can't seem to find enough documentation on the topic.  on a personal note I've been hitting the personal ads, pleading my case to the various ads that I see.  I don't think its a real alternative.  A lot of work with a lot of people not really particularly interested.  I will give myself a month.  and I will try another site.  and then try it out at the next place.  my sleep schedule is all messed up, I am going to bed to late and waking up to late as well.  I need to bite the bullet here this week and get up early and stay up.  until I get it sorted out.  need to get regular before work.  all for now

      well, I found a potential offer.  Well, I have the offer.  I just have to agree to it.  It has some stipulations about agreeing to work with them for the next two years.  a bit draconian.  what if I have a breakdown and am incompacitated and lost the will to work, what then...or the work is too hard and can't make progress on it.  I don't know.  I will let the issues resolve themselves.  I got some other offers that I am checking out.  But, I think I will go with the first offer.

      well its another day, without a job.  another computer consultant looking for work.  However, work seems to find me.  me and a friend of mine have an idea for Jini administration client.  I have some reservations one its a daunting undertaking and the other is the ability to make shrink wrapped software.  Then, their is the question if I make it will they come.  something in the order of knowing your customer.  something I am not verbose in.  So, the next thing is another project in paperless archiving, which we all know is a multibillion dollar industry, ha.  But, it is.  And, that is the next venture I will undertake.  I am thinking I will undertake this one by myself and also work with my friend Austin.  I am partly torn towards by making something marketable and the chance to collaborate with a friend on something.  I don't know if I will particularly enjoy the Jini project with my friend however...  I don't know.  I don't know, if it becomes to taxing I can take a break from one and work on another  and about my day.  I slept pretty good, I can't say I dreamed or anything, but I didn't seem to want to get out of bed at about 11am.  I am watching what I eat now more carefully and I am trying to walk to whereever whenever I can.  Well I studied some spanish.  updated my personal of Yahoo, which I found out I was paying a subscription for the past year, without even knowing it.. argh.   I watched about a half hour of 'comedy central' and about another half hour of the discovery channel.  My ability to find interest in tv has significantly wained.  I know this isn't much interest to anyone as yet, but eventually I will get to something more interesting as I get more comfortable dialogueing my life.  what to put here.. I ate some sugar free bars which gave me the farts and the craps today.  I wonder if Google will ever index anything I put in here.  I may need to stay away from key words like Java and J2EE.  I am doing some dip again (Kodiak Ice flavor), its really strong.  And, I had a Swisher sweet cigar. nice.  lat8 dayz

      Hi all, its friday night and I'm tinkering with my computer.  I tried IRC'ing for the first time in a while.  Someone said shutup and I was wondering to whom he was referring to.  It got me a bit perplexed as to IRCing causing such high emotions.  This being my first post in my newly created blog I don't know really which tone this site will take.  geeky programmer stuff or things which cross me.  well. I went for a walk about 5 miles.  Went to see a movie, The Terminal, but it had been sold out by the time I arrived.  So I walked back.  well I am going to ponder my newly created blog and decide which content I want to express.  cheers for now,

      I am closing on closing out the third week of work.  Well, I must say that I have made substantial gains in self confidence.    I'm a little unsure of how to make proper eye contact at times but I feel atleast not as bugged out about it as I had once.       I don't know if I can make it through the whole duration of my contract.  I hope I feel up to it to that point.  I suppose it really depends on whether I feel I can learn all that I need in the time required.  So, as to reduce the amount of struggle and assistance I will require later on.    I may have to readily admit it to myself so that I can atleast work with the problem that I don't really feel like working all the time.  And, that I am missing opportunities to let myself shine.    Well, I decided I am going on a camping trip with my company this weekend.  Despite myself I don't believe I will have anxiety about going on this camping adventure.  I even hope to have a good time.

      I have to say, I am feeling to the point were I feel close to normal.      I am pretty content, not too much is bothering me.    I feel I can do whatever and not get to charged or ramped up about it.  I can stay calm and now who I am through out it, whatever it may be.

      well, today was another daY waiting for training.  I am waiting to be taught about IBM's Interchange Server.  I hope I am able to the task.  I will have one month down and 23 months to go shortly.  I will try my best to keep on the level for the duration of my contract.  I am using Mandrake Linux 10 Official.  I am trying to see if it supports SMP in the Community addition.

      tomorrow is my first day of work.  It should all go smoothly.  I won't truly begin my on-the-job training for a couple of weeks.  They are going to teach me about how to configure Websphere and how to develop using an eclipse websphere tool.  It should be an interesting time.  two years.  man.  I will get to travel bonus.  But, I may have to commute long distances that aren't considered expensable.  So, I may need to to a nearby aparment or something.  Or, live nearby with my sister.  I don't know.    But, I am pretty excited by the fact that I may get a chance to study and take the SBCD, sun certified business component developer's exam.  That is what I will be studying in the meantime.  I will buy a voucher after a week of studying for the exam.  I suppose I will buy also a practice exam, just to get the hang of the test.

      hey sports fans, well, I've completed  my first month of work.  And, a complete month of no sex.  Success!  I'm still chewing tobacco and I'm still working, Success!  I'm acting squirriley in the evenings and I'm worried and uncertain in the mornings, fretful that the worst may come.  My concentration is pitiful.  My focus is a broad beam on a lot of incidentals.  But, I feel some progress is being made.  cheers.
