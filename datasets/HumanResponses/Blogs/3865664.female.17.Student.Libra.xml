      Hey who ever is reading. I'm really bored today. I got up and went to volleyball and hung out with Caryn and Angie. Had some lunch and stuff. We went shopping at UP. I found some new shoes, so cute. They are pink with a flower design in them. I also got a pair of capris and a heart necklace for half off! I was so excited. Yes, totally sad this is my life. We came back and hung out at my house for a while. I let Care paint my toe nails pretty pink and then they left cause angie had to be to work and care was going to her bf's house. I ran into Zac at Walgreens. Actually he scared the crap out of me. I didn't see him and he grabbed my shoulders and said "Boo". Turning around to his to die for smile and those bright green eyes. I know this sounds like a major chick flick or somethin but like i cannot help it! I think ya hafta meet him to be able to see what i do in him. He's one of those guys that every girl within distance just stares at and like wants him just to say hi to them. I am like totally blow the heck away that he is a friend of mine. I wanna be so much more than friends but like i don't see that happenin cuz he's gonna end up with some hott girl who's gonna be perfect to him and she's gonna use him for his looks and money and then hurt him. I've seen it done to him before and I actually had to tell him he wasn't a bad boyfriend! what kinda crap that is! She made him feel like shit about who he was and like there is not a single flaw in his personality. He's gorgeous but he doesn't think so. He's rich but he doesn't flaunt it. He's sweet and isn't afraid to show it. He could get any girl he wants but he doesn't sleep around. How can someone be like this? I am sooooooooooo confused. asjfoiasfjpoidasgj i'm just gonna stop now cuz i'm soundin obsessed or somethin. I just really love him as a friend and more and i wish he could see. But like yea it was so good seeing him today. Every time i see him i swear his smile gets brigher and those eyes........oooo those eyes. They're peircingly beautiful. i donno if i spelled that right. hehe  so  yea that's my day today and my feelings on today..........i know i had a lot to say, sry.  Kate

      Hey blog. My name is Kate and i just started this for the heck of it. My life is pretty plain. I live in Indiana with my parents and my brother, Jake. He's older them me by 2 years. I'm kinda laid back. I like art, books, music, rollerblading, shopping, doing hair, make up and just like everything. I'm not prissy or preppy at least i don't think i am. I don't have a bf. Not yet at least. I have an eye on a guy named Zac. I've known him for a couple years and they have turned out to be the best years of my life. I'm not gonna get too much into Zac on this first post cuz i can bet you will hear a lot about him through these post. He's everything i could dream and hope for but he doesn't know it. I'm too shy. Anyway there's not much to say. I work at AE here in the mall and i'm pretty happy with the job. Hey it gets me money. Ok i gtg. I'll write back later  Kate
