      I'm tellin ya what, this has been a super hectic and busy week.  I've been training a new hire class of 9 all week long from 7AM to 3:30PM.  And it seemed like the later in the week it got, the later I was staying up at night - which is not a good thing when you've got to get your ass out of bed by 5:30AM.  The people in the class made it all worthwhile, though.  They're a great bunch of kids who've got solid blocks on their shoulders.  I liked em all and they'll be great at their jobs.  Are ya feeling warm and fuzzy yet?  And I've been (re-)introduced to  urlLink Friendster  this week.  That's an amazing little place.  I never knew that I knew so many people!  And to see all their cute, sexy, crazy, funny, phreaky pictures really satisfies my oft-neglected voyeuristic tendencies.  Oh, who'm I kiddin - they're not oft-neglected.  I'm a friggin snoop!  These are some of my favs:      This is a great picture - she looks like she's at the beginning of a good laugh.            Ho-Ho-Ho, shave cream styl-ee!           I love you Mimi!!!

      You know, some days are like gold.  Everything goes your way, strangers smile at you when you pass them, and there doesn't seem to be a care in the world. And then there are days like today.  I felt like Sisyphus just pushing that old rock up the hill to see it fall down again.  Except this time the rock rolled over my big phreakin toe on it's joyride to the bottom of the hill.  My boss overruled a decision she had previously approved.  I conducted second interviews for candidates that just weren't qualified for the job.  I put another person on disciplinary probation.  I'm worried about moving to Houston and finding a place to live.  The list just goes on and on.  And you know it's really bad when you get tired of hearing yourself whine.  Oh I need a vodka martini right about now, hun.  So in an attempt to make sense of all of this without turning to that blissful beverage, I've picked up Ticht Naht Hahn's meditation book.  And that's good - I tried it out, but when I lost my focus, I lost my drive.  Mindfulness is really hard (*there goes that whining again, gosh darnit*).  Well, I'm gonna go give it another shot.  On the upshot, the phone I'm selling on eBay got it's second bid.  YEE-HAWWWWW!!!  I'm just giddy with the thought of making money on eBay!   urlLink
