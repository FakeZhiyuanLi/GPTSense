       I just read a comment by active remise (or should I say the comment, since I've only got one comment so far). Anyway, it made me think. It made me think about a good reason to be depressed. But I can't find none. I decided I'm going to be more cheerful and happy and all that sort of things from now on. I'm good at these things, changing myself. I have this 'okey, it's difficult but I am going to do it and I will finish it' attitude. And difficult it's going to be. I've decided recently that I simply do not have a dad anymore, too. It may sounds strange, but it actually makes me feel better. My dad has a handicap. And apart from the fact that he doesn't show any affection at all and that he can't remember the fact that I'm his child. He's plain ennoying. But with my 'I'm all brigthen up attitude' I won't be bothered with this anymore. I've given up hope with the Albert thing as well. That's one thing less to worry about. I'm interested in this girl now, Marinda. I like her. She's funny. I always end up in strange situations with her. Once we met this homeless gay and he offered us food. That's strange. That's weird. But I like it. Hope she has an interest in me too. Time will tell. Today, tomorrow and the day after that I've to work. Last time I worked there were these German kids (about 15). They were friendly. They tried to have a conversation with me. But I don't speak German that well. There was this girl that liked me :) But I really have to go now, look at the time. I need to sleep because I have to work soon.

       Wow, they really improved those parties since the last time I went (a few years ago). Back then it was really boring. Now the had good music, people, cool lights, an sms-wall, pictures taken that appeared on a screen immediatly. Too bad there was no alcohol. It took some time for the party got really started. But after that. Glad I went. I went with Arno. A friend. I useally don't speak to him much. He's nice though. And he likes to party. I'm not really the partyanimal (no, really, I mean it). I really should learn to dance. I met Albert there. I really should go more often to these kind of things. But then there was this slow song. Made me feel down. And the whole party confused me actually. I saw really nice girls and no boys of such. It got me thinking if I were bi, maybe not. Maybe it's just a phase. How can people like Jamai (17-year old boy who won Idols, admitted to be gay in public) know these things for sure. I hope I've got stuff to do in the upcoming holiday. My mood is greatly affected by how many things I've to do.

       I had to go to school today. I went at 11 o'clock. I was home at 15.15. The time I spend at school was 30 min tops. After school I had to comfort some people that didn't make it to the next year and had to do this one over. After that I just hung around. I went out for ice after that. I originally asked Tjitske out for ice, but I asked Feline to come along. Good thing I did that. I barely even talked to Tjitske. And I had to pay for her ice cream! Grmf. With Feline I had much more fun. She makes me laugh. I talked to her for like 2,5 hours straight after the ice cream thing. That's long. But she had to go because she needed to do 2 book reports in 3 days (including this one). Else she's going to be kicked off school. And 2 book reports, that takes a lot of time. When you look at character, she definitely would be perfect ot be my girl friend. She makes me laugh, I can talk to her. She is the closest thing to be being in my situation (depression, brother has handicap; that's almost me). And she's in to doing things after school. The thing why she isn't my girlfriend is 1) I don't see her a lot 2) She could well be qualified as a strange person 3) She's not exactly easy on the eyes 4) Not really into having a boy friend, I'm afraid. There's this girl at work who looks horrible. Seriously. But after work, she does her hair different, put's on different clothes and some makeup. And then she looks good. Sure there are still a lot of people prettier, be you can't really call her ugly anymore.

       Pff, am I finally happy again after my little moment of being completely down, now I'm helping others with their thing. Yesterday evening I had this little thing. Memories came back. Feelings came back. Not a pleasant thing. There's someone online now who's being abused by her ex boyfriend. What do you say to such a person? And there's another person who's completely down cos she hasn't got a boyfriend. Haven't got much time to talk. Not really into blogging at the moment.

       So I'm jealous. Got a problem with that? Albert and Niki are boy/girlfriend and I want the same thing. Actually, I'd like the exact same thing Niki has. Why not? Who said boys should always fall for girls. I do like girls, but I like boys as well. Too bad I can't tell anybody. Not everyone is as openminded about things as I am. But me and Albert do have a lot of fysical contact. More than regular friends, I guess. I touch him, he touches me. He bit me, I tried to bite back (in a friendly way of course). His head was between my legs, yes, his head was leaning on something. His hands were in a certain spot and sort of carressed me there. I sat on his lap, close to stuff. I touched him virtually everywhere except for that one spot. I almost kissed him, but there were other people and so he doubted and turned away just in the nick of time. Well, how do get that with a straight guy? It just happens more or less. You need to carefully build these things up. Suggest things, but in such a manner so he doesn't know wheter your serious or not. Sit next to him and move a bit closer. Go a bit deeper into subjects that could lead to things. Like the kissing thing. I hurt him, he said he wanted a kiss to make it up (of course he was joking) and I took my chance. When you're sitting in a small bus with no space and no room to sleep (we're already up for more then 24 hours), you just go lay next each other. It ends with laying on each other. But I doubt if I ever get him so far that he'd actually do something to write about. He has a girlfriend. Maybe when they break up and he's really sad. But I'm afraid that could take a long, long time. They are so happy with each other. It's horrible. They were MY friends, not each others! I want love too! I want it, i want it, i want it. But sitting here wining, isn't going to make things better, sadly enough. Girls always like me, but never love me. Horrible. Albert does think I'm cute (for a guy). Jealousy is bringing out the worst in me. Depression, hate, silence (I become very silent when I'm jealous). The depression thing is already something I should be carefull with. I've had a serious depression more than once. That, my friends, is not cool. It's weird. When I'm seriously depressed I always get the feeling I'm being followed. When I'm depressed I always get a bad thought in my head that just stays there and I can't anything else but to think about that exact thought. When I try to think about something else, it just leads back to that thought. And of course the suicide thought. Not very pleasant thought. But the weird thing is that when I take this medicine it all goes away and I become happy with no reason. Chemics decide what I think, what I feel, what I do. Diner is waiting for me, so'll leave. Bye for now

       Filmplans didn't made it through. I went shopping for clothes with my mom instead. Was cool. Thought it would be boring. Normally is boring. But this time it was different. I actually liked it, the whole picking clothes and fitting them. Useally I'm half sleeping/ half braindead when I've to fit something. I got some really nice clothes. Hope I'll like them tomorrow. I useally regret buying clothes after a while. I fixed my website a bit. Made a test at school. Tried to play the piano again. I found out the sheet music I used isn't right. It just doesn't sound right. No, it's not me! I'll pursue this hobby I think. It's not like I'm going to be real busy the upcoming holiday. I'm going to try to improve myself yet again. This sounds a bit weird maybe. But that's just a thing I have. I'm always trying to improve myself. Then I'll try to change my character, my appearance, my way of thinking or whatever. I fixed a lot about myself this way. Before I used to be a really shy kid with absolutely no social skills and no idea of reality. Last Christmas I volunteered (somebody had to do it, so it might as well be me) to say something about charity and stuff at my school in front of 90 people. I'd loved it if it would be more, but that wasn't going to happen. And it went perfectly. No stumbling, no soft or too loud voice. Ordered the guys in the back to be quiet, they listened. I now have a vast network of friends. Most of them are more acquintencens. Some I just hang out not because I like them so much, but because they have something I want. But there are a few good friends. And I know everything about everybody, first hand. No gossips. Boy, there are many things that can go wrong in someone's life. I wonder why people trust me so much. Saw a movie on the tube this evening with my sis. My sis and I don't hang with each other as much as we used to. I miss that. Tomorrow: hear wheter I go a schoolyear higher or if I have to do this year over. Also I'm going to hang with Albert. Will that turn out right? Don't know. I do not really like his kind of people

       Just had a science test at school. Utterly boring as useal. Got an 7 for psychics. That was nice. Sometimes I'd just like to dissolve or something. Like now. I have not much to do, but I'm not really bored and I'm not really into doing something. Like think, but I always go think when I've nothing to do. Bad habit. Cos when I think, I useally go worry about something that's not worth worring or about something that I can't change. At the moment I'm happy with my life, but not thrilled. I don't have much to write. If I were smart, I'd be learning now. Tomorrow I have a test on Dutch. I think that's difficult. I've to learn about all the different spell/grammar/style errors you can make. I need to know the name, what it is and be able to correct them. Dutch grammar is difficult. With d's and t's everywhere. And things like 'incorrect concise bijzin (whatever that's in English)'. Pff, glad I've almost got holiday. What to relearn to play the piano. I used to play the piano. Still know all the notes, it's just I have to think too long before I know what note a note is. Have the sheet music of Hello from Evanescence. Cool song. I like Evanescence. Though they're not really my style. Thursday I might go see a film with some friends. Friday I'm going to hang with Albert. Hope that's going to work out. Not that after an hour or so he'll say he needs to do something else. That would be typically him. I hate him, but I love him, so I'll just use him until he becomes available again. Saturday I'm going to the cinema. See, if got two groups of friends. The first group consist of very good friends, too bad they are boring as hell and never do something. The second group consist of people who say they're my friends (just like I say they're my friends). They do stuff, that's cool. Too bad they are less social, backstabbing and they fix on somebody and hang with him/her and exclude the rest. They give me mixed feelings. I always think, are they my friends or not? But they are fun so I'll stick around. Sunday I've to work. That's my schedule for the next few days.

       At school I've the whole week tests. Tomorrow I've math and management&organisation. Sigh. I don't want to learn. Like if I'd ever do something with those subjects. Today I had tests as well. English was easy. Physics, mm, I don't know. When I started making the test, I didn't knew one answer. At the end I started again from the last question to the first. That went better. Afterwards I went to get some ice cream with Albert. I have no clue what to do with him. Where I stand in his eyes. Does he like me, doesn't he like me? First we were like 3 days of the week together after school. But since he has this girlfriend it's more like one day in 3 weeks. I don't know if I like him anymore for doing this. I try to spend as much time as possible with him, but he can't expect that everything should come from my side. And besides, when I try to get some time with him, he always comes with the remark: 'oh, i'll see if niki (his girlfriend) can come'. At those times I'd rather just walk away from him. About 2 hours ago, the dog needed to walk. So I asked Tjitske to come join me. She came. We had fun, we have this role playing game going on. It sounds childish, it is, but its fun. I really wanted to talk to her seriously, but neither she or me was in the mood for it. We were too busy laughing. Debbie asked me to play this computergame a while ago when I was online. It seems like if I got friends. But this is more a coincidence of friend-like events. At the moment everybody seems to have a girl/boyfriend, except me. Why doesn't anyone love me enough?

        I believed in you, I gave up everything just to find you   Christ, tourniquet, my suicide   I have absolutely nothing to do at the moment. I hung up some photo's at my closet, looks really nice. Feelin' kind of down again. I'm lost in my mind again. I'm now chatting with this girl who has an unipolar impairment (is that English?), anyway she has sort of the same thing I have and talking to her makes my feel that someone understands me, but she makes me think about things I don't want to think about.  A reason that I'm down at the moment could well be the fact that I discovered that my "dad" couldn't remember his kids (me) after his accident and properbly still can't remember them today. The only reason he knows that I'm his kid, is that people told him I am. That, my dear readers, is not a thing you want to hear. That is something that really ruÃ¯nes your day like nothing else ever did. But it ruined my day today. I guess I sort of felt it already before I knew. I never really felt loved by him. I hate everything about him. Why? particularair reason. I just do. If it were up to me, they'd put people like my dad away.  Belgian people talk funny   My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation

       Damn you Portuguese people. I just saw the Netherlands - Portugal. No orange hair anymore I guess. Should I get a different hair colour? Why not? Maybe it looks good. I just bought the CD of Evanescence. I think I should be more different then other people. Yesterday I saw this programme on the tube about bicuriousity. Why not? Maybe it's really cool to be bi, it's definitly different. I think I'm going to set 'being different' as my goal for this year.   At the moment I'm chatting to this girl. I hate the people I know. They 1) do not pay enough attention to me or 2) are not nice or 3) are so smallminded. Maybe I shouldn't complain that much. There are some nice people I know. And guess what, my (ex-)best friend is finally showing interest in me. Where has that been the past 2 weeks when I needed him? No he thought that being with his new girlfriend was more important then helping a friend who was thinking of killing himself. Yeah I have a problem and no I'm not going to see a doctor and I'm not mad. But it's over now (but for how long?).  I'm realling looking forward to when I'm able to go away from here for a year, this country and this continent. Not that things will be different somewhere else. But when I'm in a new enviroment I get the chance to make a fresh start. Life is like a science-test at school. I never get the first question right until I made the second one that is exactly like the first question but with different numbers.
