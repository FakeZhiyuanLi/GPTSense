      I'm sooooooo happy! Life seems especially perky for me at the moment. Though gloom hung over me last night, reality has set in and the sun shines brighter than ever....for one particular reason at this moment in time, my day just got better! Gotta go

       Doubt doubt doubt, worry worry worry. That's all I did last night. Despite the fact I'd had an awesome afternoon with my friend. We walked around pike place, down by the pier and went to see the salmon ladder at the docks. A perfect day, until I decieded to become a worry wart in fear that all that I had would be snatched away from me. Why do we do that? The enemy whispers his annoying little voice, or your flesh goes crazy & speaks just babble! The only voice I want to be listening to is the voice of the Lord's. Unfortunately last night, I don't think I was. But the closest thing to a brother I have here came through for me. Last night he text me, "Don't be down, but rejoice. Don't fear, but trust." Those words were comfort to my heart and soul as I realised all my fears were all completely irrational.   Isaiah 30:21 " Whether you turn to the right or the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you saying "This is the way; walk in it."  The Lord is good. His mercies, His love and His faithfulness NEVER fail us. He will perfect that which concerns us today. So, I find myself reminded to just simply trust the Lord with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding, like Proverbs 3:5-6 says.....and in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths.

      A large group of my friends leave for Mission France in 6 short days. It makes me sad...I will definately miss them. Previously I have found times of separation a good thing. When they return, I know that I'll appreciate them more. I can the look forward to the fun times that lie ahead this summer. Fun fun fun! But until then, I'll miss you!

      Ok, so don't see Stepford wives. Don't ask me why, just don't see it.  You'd be wasting your time!  I went with Brett, Adam and Arielle last night to see it...a little embarrassing. But we ended a night with a good old starbars!!

      1 Chronicles 22:19 "Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the Lord your God."  Lately I have found that no matter what decisions I need to make, or what blessing are coming my way, I need to make my number one priority to have my heart devoted and soul seeking the Lord. How can we ever expect to have guidance, peace and all that we desire when we are not doing this? "Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart." How true that is for me right now, but I know I must believe it even when I'm not getting all that I hope for.  I think if we take just a little time in our day to see all that He is truly giving us, the seen and unseen, we would be far far more content. I think the secret of being content is grattitude, at least one of the secrets. It will amaze you when you search your life to the smallest detail, you will see all that He is givng and has given you. Be thankful friends. Be a giver, not just financially, but with your time. Are you willing to give up part of your precious free time in order to minister to a brother or sister in need? Be that blessing!

        Today I'm not sure whether to feel excited about the current guy situation in my life, fearful or nervous. Fearful because as each day goes by I know my heart is becoming attached. Do I risk the chance of getting my heart broken yet again? I'm not sure if it can handle another blow. But, I choose to trust the Lord. My heart is in His hands. He WILL lead and direct me. For once, I think possibly the first time in my life I see definate hope in this.  Sorry not to be more open with you all, but until I know how this will turn out, I'd rather keep it between a handful of us. But please please pray for me. I feel I'm so new to this whole thing of "praying" about a relationship. I've never got to this point before....so keep trusting Him!!

      Did I ever tell you how much I love Yac? Actually, I should say how much I love Yac youth!   Tonight I get to lead our very first "Strand of sisters!". The alternative to Band of brothers. My vision is, and I believe it is the Lord's is to bring in more discipleship for all you wonderful young gals. We all strive to become women after God's own heart, an what an awesome opportunity we can have to come together and seek Him.  Just want all you girls to know that even though I don't always say it, "I love you all very very much." Whenever you need prayer or just someone to listen to you, I will always try to be there. After the Lord, you girls are my priority. What an awesome gift from the Lord each and everyone of you are!  Anyway, I must put together the worship set. I need prayer that He would fill me with His Spirit and anoint the worship. May we glorify Him in ALL that we say and do.

      Why is it so hard to wait? How can you be sure that you're really hearing from the Lord? I know at times we just need to takes steps of faith into the unknown, but when i ask? How am I supposed to know? I really want to take a big step of faith, so do I just do it? Well, maybe any of you could answer me, I'm puzzled...

       My parents called this morning, and to my delight they are coming out to California at the end of my stay, then driving up with me to Seattle.   Sometimes all that we plan just causes us to fall flat on our faces. We set our hearts on those things that He has yet to reveal are His will. So, I ask you this today,"Do you really want God's will above all else?" It's hard to give up those things we want. But, one thing we'll find as we delight ourselves in Him, He will give us the desires of our heart. We begin to realise that when being led by the Spirit, the things we chose for our lives, are the things that He has already chosen for us. Isn't that awesome. Praise God that not only does He give us salvation and pours out abundant grace into our lives, but He also desires to bless us.  One last thought...remember that we don't deserve the blessings He's brought our way. He blesses because of His love toward us. I say this out of experience of trying to turn down His blessing because I knew I didn't deserve it. The point is, I will never deserve them, no matter how good I feel, how much I serve, or how much I love. I, like all of us need to willing to embrace the blessings He's brought and going to bring your way.  Eph 3:20 "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly above all that you can ask or imagine."

      Well, maybe I spoke too soon. After a long and eventfull day yesterday, it turns out that I'm unable to get my passport back, or a temporary one to go to France. So, I pack my bags and get ready to head to California to see my sister, her husband and my niece this Friday.  I don't know why things turned out this way, but I do know that I need to continue to just keep trusting and obeying Jesus...there's no other way. Besides, having a holiday in California isn't the hardest thing to face now is it? Keep smiling buddies, you never know who's day you'll brighten!

       After having stayed up far too late pondering and praying about my current situations, I woke to face a beautiful morning. My usual climb up the hill by my house didn't seem so hard today. It's some what of a ritual for me when I make the climb,and without fail, I turn to see the lake. What beauty it held today. I can't help but remember the greatness of our Creator. No matter how the weather is each day, the view I see is always breath taking. I guess it's like our lives, no matter what circumstances we face each day, there's always beauty in it when we look at them through the eyes of Christ. The beauty is consistent, like God, and how we need to be.  The most beautiful place to be, at the center of His will. How can we know where that is if we do not pray? Colossians 1:9-10 "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God." 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18 "Pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus." The Lord is good and He withholds no good thing from those who walk uprightly. So everything that is good, in His timing He will give us. However we must remember that in His divine wisdom, He knows what is ultimately good for us. When something appears to be good and yet He's not given it two us, there is one of two things. Firstly, it's not His timing yet, or He can see, that though it may appear good now, it eventually will not be.  Surely it is better to lose now and ultimately win, than win now and ultimately lose. Anyway, have a great day in the Lord friends. Keep praying...

      Well, there's no other choice. I'm off to France. I need to cancel my visa application because my passport wouldn't be back in time for Whistler...so the only other way for me to be here is to leave overseas (mex and canada don't count) and get another six months on my visa so I can be at whistler. So, it leaves France as the only option. Sometimes things get so complicated, I feel like pulling out my hair. Then I stop and remember, "Be still and know that I am God". It's not our job to try and figure everything out, just let the Lord do it. He will plan your way before you. God Bless   Eph 3:20 " Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask or think."

      There You stand,  More beautiful than I had ever imagined. Can it be so,  that I have waited my whole life, just to see Your glory? Bright morning Star, I see You filling the sky, across the horizon. My heart can't contain, the measure that I am receiving, that I am receiving.  Now that You are here, please tell me this isn't a dream. Now that You are here, this is everything to me, You're the reason I believe.  I can't stop thses tears, falling so freely flowing, down my face. I fall to my knees, 'cause I don't know what else to do, standing before you. Your hand wipes away, every tear that I've cried, that fell from these eyes. What I thought was Your touch, has a whole different meaning now, a more beautiful meaning.  Now that You are here, please tell me this isn't a dream. Now that You are here, this is everything to me, You're the reason I believe.

       Just waiting around for the department of security to answer my call....should be a good 20 mins. So I got a letter today letting me know that my whole visa will take between 150 and 180 days!!!Arghhhhhhhh!! So, Mexico is out, but maybe if I can get them to cancel my application and just send back my passport I'll be able to go to France. Anyway, all is in His hands, maybe I'll be going to California to see my family.  ........still waiting!

      Ever feel like you've been hit by a bus? I feel like that right now. I do recommend to all you hard working folk out there, take time to nap! Don't feel guilty about wasting the time....you need to rest. Don't just be a Martha, don't just be a Mary, be a healthy mix. That's what it's all about..BALANCE. Well I'm about to head home, possibly I'll nap and freshen up for tonight. Going to an open mic with Seth and Joey, two gifted musician friends. Should be fun, especially as there'll be coffee around!!

      I asked you if you liked me, you said no. I asked you if I was pretty, you said no. I asked you if I was in your heart you said no. I asked you if you would cry if I walked away, you said no.  So I walked away ... You grabbed my arm and said ...  I dont like you,  I love you You are not pretty, you are beautiful You are not in my heart, you are my heart And I wouldn't cry if you walked away,  I would die.....  A friend cheered me up with this poem today, maybe it'll cheer you.

       Having come home after a long day I found myself totally anxious. So many things to figure out, so many things to wait for, so many burdens....so I found no other place to go but on my knees.  Do we find comfort in our worrying? Well I certainly don't, but one thing I know is my flesh definately feasts on it. So, finally I remember that no amount of worrying I do will change a thing, other than my stress level. Surely when He says "Be anxious for nothing", He means nothing. So I have no excuse. No situation, circumstance, no person, gives me or you the right, or the grounds to worry.   "The meek man is not a human mouse afflicted with a sense of his own inferiority. Rather, he may be in his moral life as bold as a lion and as strong as Samson; but he has stopped being fooled about himself. He has accepted God's estimate of his own life. He knows he is as weak and helpless as God has declared him to be, but paradoxically, he knows at the same time thathe is, in the sight of God, more important than angels. In himself, nothing; in God, everything. That is his motto.He knows well that the world will never see him as God sees him and he has stopped caring. He rests perfectly content to allow God to place his own values. He will be patient to wait for the day when everything will get it's own price tag and real worth will come into it's own.Then the righteous shall shine forth in the kingdom of their Father. He is willing to wait for that day." - A.W Tozer  -Cast your cares on Him for He cares for you. -Be anxios for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made know to God. And the peace which surpasses all understanding shall guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. -You will keep Him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on You. Because he trust in You.  When you feel like you can't make it one more day, ask yourself this, "Where am I looking?". Keep going, keep running the race friends.  That's all for now.

       "I don't usually take chance  Most would usually agree  Something in your eyes  Is saying you can ease my heartache I have a hurting inside And I know you're just a stranger If you can't I'll understand There's too many times I've lost My chance to talk with an angel Too many to count And life's so hard It's the little things that seem to be getting me today Yeah, life's so hard But I'm doing what I can not to be getting down While I'm going down in flames And I would tell you I am happy If I wasn't so darn sad And the lonliness both Overwhelms and keeps me empty, That's how it's been for a while I need some direction I need someone to listen Someone to tell me that they know that Life's so hard It's the little things that seem to be saving me today And life's so hard And I'm doing what I can And I'm doing what I can And I'm doing what I can I'm putting out the flames" - Mindy Smith

       Today my blogspot begins.... It's senior night, after making two huge banoffee pies with Jordan, and organising other random things, I'm pretty pooped. What's new? Well after a lady backed out of the france trip, she has donated her ticket to me!! How awesome is the Lord? Kind of crazy when one minute I thought I'd be going to Mexico, then california, and now I'm shocked, but more so, overwhelmed by the blessings He is currently pouring out on my life.  When we pause to stop looking around at all the things we want, and take the time to see what He has given us, how can we doubt His ability to supply our every need? Blessing lies in being a blessing. It's not about going in seeking all that you can, but the opposite. Go into whatever situation, whatever ministry you are in, asking yourself, "What can I give?" not "What can I get?."  So I find myself pondering upon what could be the Lord's purpose in having me so many miles away from home, so far from family? the answer? I'll probably never understand in full, but one for sure, to be a blessing to His people here in Seattle, here at Calvary Fellowship. Love you my friends...never want to leave.   Having attended school in England, for those that do not know, we have no social events....including prom!! Yes shocking, we Brits are pretty unsociable people. Ha! So, I was kindly invited to our youthgroup prom this friday. I have two possible dates, one would be like going with a little brother, the other a friend. So, although the brother type if more than willing, I'd rather go with the friend. However I'm not sure how comfortable he is with the idea, so we'll just see. Either way it's going to be a great night!

       This week has been somewhat busy for me, but these last two days...hectic and crazy! I'm sooooooooooooooooo tired. Anyway, last night was nice. After a long and exhausting day, I relaxed whilst watching the "Tour De Terrace" parade with Seth, Austin and David.  Seth and I then made it down to Edmonds beach in time to watch the sunset. I think I could very well be the luckiest girl alive right now! Seth is an incredible and amazing guy!  Any of you guys want to hep me get Whistler stuff ready, this week would be the time I'd really could do with the help. Tuesday after VBS Jordan and I are costco shopping for groceries, and the wed and thurs we 'll be dividing it all up for each room in whistler...22 in total! I have a real big job on my hands, so if you're just bored at home, please please please come on down to the church. Thanks Lauren, David and Famy...you guys were so a big help this weekend!  I plan on watching the fireworks at the "tour de Terrace" tonight with Seth. Should be fun!

      Well, it's been a crazy weekend. Headed down to Olympia for the weekend as I was in my friends wedding. It was a huge reunion, many of my friends were there that I haven't seen in some time, but to be honest, I was quite happy just spending the reception with my sister and her husband and Seth. &nbsp;There were the usuals dancing the night away, but I refrained. I have two left feet! Not really, just don't really have the knack for dancing. &nbsp;We raced home in time to see 'The Bourne supremecy'. Cool movie, definitely worth seeing. I've been to two weddings this month, plus I missed one this past saturday. Then there's yet another one in Oly in august and then back here in Seattle, Gina and Jeff are getting married too! It is most definitely the summer of weddings. There are many more, however there are only so many a girl can go to before she gors crazy...wait a minute, I'm already crazy.  &nbsp;As for me, I'm quite content with dating. I'm having so much fun, and are overwhelmed by the blessings He is pouring out into my life. &nbsp;"Every good and every perfect gift comes from God."

      &nbsp;To begin, let me make one thing clear. We are all called to&nbsp; serve...not to be served. I'm sure we've all grasped that,&nbsp;however, is that all that you do? At times, I think I'm guilty of this, and most likely many of you. It is essential for our growth in the&nbsp;Lord to be a healthy balance of Mary and Martha. Not just serving, but also sitting at His feet.  &nbsp;Here's a quote from Elisabeth Elliot's devotional book, "The music of His promises.&nbsp;"Pascal once observed&nbsp; that most of man's troubles resulted from his inability to sit quietly in his room. It is worth thinking about. Today's turmoil and trouble may be seen in God's perspective if we will take time,&nbsp; go into a room and shut the door, sit down, and be quiet&nbsp;before Him. He is God. He is in charge. Be still and know that."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;I'm sure I'm not the only one, who at times, thinks of the future and becomes so anxious. He tells us to be anxious for nothing. NOTHING! That's not one thing! So, I realised my need to be open to whatever He has for me. I truly thought that I was open to anything. It turns out that anything did not include giving up being here at Calvary Fellowship. It makes me feel sick to think that there would be such change in my life. &nbsp;However&nbsp;hard it is to think that one day I might leave here, I have peace that He will prepare me for that, give me the grace to do it, if that is His will.&nbsp;Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen, there are no plans to at the moment. But, I think the Lord wanted to challenge my heart. There should be nothing that we are holding onto so tight that He would have to pry out of our hands. So, here I am, my hands are open, take whatever&nbsp;You will Lord. &nbsp;Change can be hard, but in the long run it is always for our&nbsp;best. I used to think I wanted to move to Olympia, but God gave me Seattle. It was hard, but now I look back and see how glad I am that He&nbsp;gave&nbsp;me the grace to be obedient. I wouldn't know all you great people!!&nbsp;  Keep seeking His will for your life. No matter what the sacrifice, remember that He see the end from the beginning.

      &nbsp;I read this great quote by Elizabeth Elliot today. It really spoke to me regarding a couple of things. One, because it's beginning to look like I won't be able to make it to Whistler this year because I'm still awaiting the return of my visa and passport. I know I must trust that if I don't go, that He has other plans, even if I don't understand them yet. The second thing is I see what an awesome man of God He has given me. If the Lord had not given me a "no" on&nbsp; previous guys, would I be with Seth right now? Praise God that He knows what is better for us than we know ourselves. Anyway, here it is, "Prayer establishes a relationship between God and His child. An earthl;y father, because of his responsible love for the little one, says yes to some requests and no to others. So God does. Think back to childhood. What if our fathers had given us exactly what we asked for when we asked? What sort&nbsp;of adoloscents would we have become? What sort of adults?&nbsp;Thank God He loves us purely. He has often, therefore, said a strong, infinitely loving ,&nbsp;no.  Thank Him for that. He may say yes to a foolish prayer - as the father of the prodigal did - but that answer will give us a hard lesson, and ultimately drive us back to Him with a new understanding of what our relation to Him was intended to be in the first place. "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with great mercies have I drawn thee" (Jer 31:3). God's "No's" were some of those great mercies. &nbsp;

      &nbsp; "You know, you've always kind of reminded me of a deer!"&nbsp;  I thought about it for a few moments, and replied, "Like a deer caught in the headlights?".  &nbsp;So, this was his funny little way of paying me a compliment. Kind a strange but cute at the same time. I said he reminded me of a drum playing monkey at times....  Anyway, what animal do you think your friends would&nbsp;say you were? Do comment

      &nbsp;So, if you happen to be in the Calvary Fellowship youth room (the Yac room), watch out for mice...more importantly watch out for the numerous mouse traps. Craig got a little wild with them, they're everywhere. After reminding myself to be careful, "SNAP!", I stood on one. But praise God, the only harm was that I got a tremendous shock!  &nbsp;The repulsive dead mouse stench still lurks around the room. It brings back a flood of memories of when my late fat cat Sooty would bring me "Gifts" in the middle of the night. Not only would I have to get out of bed to pat him, "Good boy sooty!", but then in my attempt to fall back to sleep, I'd have to bear the sound&nbsp; of him munching on his snack...there's nothing like hearing the crunching of a mouse's skull! Sick, sick, sick!

      &nbsp;Yesterday.....Had a wonderful evening. We went down to the Seattle bite! For you guys that don't know what it is, well it's this big food festival down at the Seattle center. Lots of different restaurants from Seattle and around serve some of their best dishes. Unfortunately there are few free samples, but it it's totally worth it. A lot of fun!! Try the chili Verde, yum yum!  &nbsp;  We dropped by Divas for a Mocha, but Seth's decided to give up coffee, so he opted for a steamed milk.&nbsp; Giving up coffee when you work at Starbucks? Isn't that bad for business? Anyway, there's always steamers and Iced tea!!!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;After filling our faces, we went to see "Eternal Sunshine". An emo, but good Jim Carey Movie. Now playing at the Crest theater on 5thAve, only $3.  &nbsp;  Seth, you're a great date planner!

       So I woke this morning to the sound of my phone beeping, to let me know I'd just received a text message. "Morning sunshine!" it said. I just smiled and replied, "I'm no sunshine, more like a foggy cloud!"  Anyway, you are probably wondering what on earth I'm talking about, but you see, the reason this is a very special thing is because it was from my boyfriend Seth! Yes, the "special friend" I kept mentioning is no other than our friend Seth Oglesby. As of Sunday evening we became a couple. I'm so so happy and excited. Now that he's just announced it on his blog (angelsanddragons.blogspot.com), I have the freedom to tell you guys. Cool Hey?  Have a great day...keep trusting, praying and get in His Word today.

       I woke this morning to see the sun blazing through my window. I just love Summer, and with the way things are going right now, it's going to be a great one.  There is nothing like grabbing a toffee almond bar and a venti iced black tea on a warm summer evening. I guess being British gives me the excuse to drink as much tea as I like, right? Well, that's what I did last night down at Starbucks with my chums. Austin, what happened to you? We were looking forward to hanging out with you, but you never returned. I then walked around Greenlake with you know who, and headed home.   My mouth hurts. The roof of it, to be precise. It's probably from sucking on one of those dreadful mints from Tony Roma's. You know the ones that are really hard and as you suck them, they become kind of sharp in your mouth. I knew I shouldn't have. There was that voice that said, "No, Lydia don't do it." But of course, I had to ignore it and I'm now paying the penalty.

       With the amount of pondering I've done today, some would think I have nothing to do. Wrong, work just awaits me. I will begin...soon. I think most would say, one of the worst things about me is that I cannot seem to get out of the cycle of putting things off. Then suddenly, like a train off it's tracks, or a huge pile up on I5, I find there's a huge back log of things to do. I do not intend on getting to that point, but I know I'm near.   So I was thinking about these past six or seven months. I thounght back to such heartbreak, from which I thought I would never recover. However, I held onto the fact that the Lord always has better. He had a plan for me, a future. Even though I couldn't see it, I now look today and I can see where He has brought me. Repeatidly I have seen his faithfulness to me, and how my failures never cease. How can I embrace His blessings when I know how little I deserve them? That's a question I cannot answer. So, I thank you Lord that You love me so much more than I can imagine, and that You choose to look past my doubts, my failures and fears, and see Christ. It's a humbling thing when God gives you something you have longed for. When you're honest with yourself, you know you don't deserve it.    I began a journey this week, a journey that I don't know what the destination will be. All I know is that it's not just his hand I long to hold to take me, but the Father's hand. He who withholds no good thing from those who walk uprightly. He who loves us so much, that He doesn't give us everything we ask for. In His deep and divine wisdom He sees the end from the beginning. Lord teach me to only walk in Your ways. Help me to embrace this journey with joy and not fear, with trust and not doubt. May You be the center of our lives.   Over these past five weeks as I prayed and prayed that God's will would be revealed to me, I found my heart saying "Go for it!". But how could I be sure, what if my heart, my feelings were tricking me? So I asked that the Lord would clearly speak to me through His would about my heart. Sure enough, the Lord was faithful to speak to me. "Nathan said to David, 'Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you." Sunday evening it all came to pass. His will to me was confirmed. I feel like a child, entering the world of the unknown. Maybe like a kid at the gates of Disney world. There's more excitement and curiosity than can be imagined.  So, it's 4:30, about time to start finishing up and think about catching the bus home. Maybe I'll go out tonight, maybe I won't. Just waiting for him to call. Have a great night whatever ya'll doing.

       I have every reason to be on top of the world right now, but unfortunately I'm a little down. Please keep me in prayer my friends. On a good note, I arrived back from my friends wedding saturday night and then had church sunday morning. We had band of sisters that evening which went really well. I love you girls!  Something very exciting in my life happened that evening, some of you know exactly what I'm talking about, and the rest will soon know as the word gets around. For now, I won't be announcing it on my blog.   Remember the Lord wants to bless you. I really had to remember this over these past few weeks when I was so tempted to doubt and not trust. The Lord has been so faithful to me, and what He has just given me I can hardly believe is happening. The start of something new and very exciting. So if you're discouraged and thinking that the Lord is holding back on you, He's not, He waiting for His perfect timing which quite often is not ours.  'Til later...

      Well, my eyes are red, my head is pounding, and have a little sleep depravation (but I don't come close to you guys who just flew in from Paris!). My sister and I just completed a 14 hour journey from California up to Olympia, Wa. Man, it was a long day, but we did manage to get in two starbucks visits, and a few wrong turns!! So, for those of you wondering, I'll be home Saturday evening. I cannot wait to see you all. Or call me..text me....I'd love to talk...I always love to talk...but not tonight. My mind is about to shut down, so I will spare you any details. Sweet dreams......

       So, I've finally managed to make it to a computer. I'm still in california hanging with the family. I'm missing home a lot....I miss my buddies, but this time has been great. I think it's been good for me to be away for a while. I feel as though the Lord has being giving me clearer direction for the upcoming decisions I need to make, plus He has definately renewed my strength in Him during this time. Well, gotta go. To all you Yacsters, I love and miss you and can't wait to see you all.

       Though my head is pounding from having my eyes glued to the computer for the past three days, I'm quite happy. All my admin work for the Whistler trip id one! YAHOOOOO!  Just the big shop on Sunday and dividind up all the food. It'll be a pretty big job, however I am so organised I don't think anything could possibly go wrong.  So, if anyone wants to help after church on sunday, just meet me in the Yac room. We should do lunch first and then get started!  Nothing much has ben happening. It's Seth's birthday tomorrow, so I get the day off. It's been kind of hectic around here, but I'm glad to see that most of the work for the summer is coming to an end.  If you haven' been to the passion and purity study at my apartment on monday nights, check it out. We're having an awesome time  hearing what the Lord has to teach us regarding the subject. We won't have one this week as most people are away for Whistler, but the next for sure. The week after that we're having a sleepover, so bring your pillows and sleeping bags!  Hopefully I'll get a date tonight, but I'll just wait and see as a I get to spend the whole day with him tomorrow.....but then I am going to be away for the week...hmmm!  Have a great week, I won't be blogging whilst I'm gone.

      I'll just give you a quick update...Praise the Lord I'm going to Whistler. The Lord has been so faithful!! My paasport came in the mail this past Monday, plus my visa was extended. God is good!  Basically I've been at my computer all day doing room assignments, shopping lists, more lists, check lists and yet moer lists. I cannot wait for whistler, plus I get to go to Crew whistler too with our college group. Seth is also going, so it should be a pleasant break! It's Seth's birthday on Saturday, I got him a really cute gift...I won't say what it is incase he reads this. I made him a card...not what I'd usually would do, however, it's far cuter than any card I could have bought. I want to make it a really special day for him, so if any of you have any ideas let me know. I'm hoping to take him on the Kingston ferry during the day, walk the beach there and go for crepes. In the evening we're going to a show that a friend of ours is playing at. Should be fun! That's all for now....Happy birthday Jordan Taylor and happy birthday to you lovely Lockett twins tomorrow!

       I'm so frustrated, I'd rather not say why, I just am. I'm still at the church, have been all day. We had an auction so raise funds for our annual youth retreat at Whistler. It went really well, we made mucho bucks! Today is just one of those days...maybe because I'm tired. I should just go home but then I don't like to miss Father's house...so as Seth is having dinner with his friend, I guess that leaves me just chilling here, wasting time online!

       WOW! Had an awesome time last night. Seth, Austin , Karen and I went to the "Tour De Terrace". We went on the ferris wheel and watched the fireworks...very romantic indeed!!  Then, there is nothing like finishing the night with Dick's fires and a strawberry shake. YUM!
