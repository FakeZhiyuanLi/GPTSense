        lovelife?  what a broad topic!  just thought about it just now.  why?  simply because, at my age people are starting to ask why i don't have one?  well, aside from the fact that the right person has not yet come or just been a foolish one to see me, what else can i think of?  GOD's will.  i guess so.  this is not yet the right time, the right place, and most of all, i am not yet the right person as weel as my better half was not yet also the right one.  but what if there was really no one for me?  i could have my best friend, my siblings, my parents, my friends as my lovelife.  what do you think?

      As the night sets in, when my eyes grow dim,  My thoughts drift away. Better days, I pray!  For my mind is worn, and my feelings torn,  And my hope is fading fast.   In a silent song, for You, Lord, I long.  Can a wordless prayer say the load I bear?  For my tongue is weak, I can barely speak  Of the longings in my heart.     REFRAIN Let my spirit sing of the love You bring. Let Your mercy win over pain within. Let my life be blest, and my soul, refreshed. Let my spirit sing and in Your love find rest.    Walking endless roads, as my life unfolds,  Turning left may be right; not a clue in sight.  Where each path would lead,  Whether God would heed all the choices I decide?  (REF x3)

      The God of silence beckons me  To journey to my heart  Where He awaits  O Lord, I hear You calling tenderly  To You I come to gaze  At the beauty of Your face I cannot see   To rest in Your embrace I cannot feel  To dwell in Your love hurting but sweet  To be with You; to glimpse eternity   God of night, fount of all my delight.  Show Your light . . . that my heart, like Yours, burn bright.   Be still the torment of the night  Will not encumber you, if you believe  My child this darkness isn't emptiness  For here I mold your heart  Unto My image painfully you long to see   The self you yearn to be, but fear to know  The world from which you flee in Me find home  All these I give you, if you remain in Me   COUNTERPOINT:  I am ever here  My child, you need not fear  The dark will set you free  And bring your heart to Me   CODA:  The God of silence beckons me  To journey to my heart  Where He awaits me.

        actually, i just saw this blog tittle in my friend's own blog.  i think this is a good starter.  my first name is a unique one.  there is only a slim probability that i there is someone out there who had the same name.  if there is, please do check the spelling.  why?  simply because it is a combination of my parent's name.  my father's name + mother's name =  ME .  should i reveal my name to the whole web?  well, let me think about it first.        another thing that makes my name special is the love that i have from my parents.  they're not the perfect parents but for me, im blessed to have them.  they may not be the best, but just having them makes everything perfect.  they had raised me well and i owe a lot from them.        well, i guess for now, let's settle for this.  if ever, i changed my mind, i'll reveal my name.  to those who knew me, im just sharing a part of me.
