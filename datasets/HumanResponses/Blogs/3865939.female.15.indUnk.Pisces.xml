      wow...i learned a lot today. It seems like i know more about myself now then i have in a long time. An Amazing guy showed me this Bible Verse today...and it showed the reason for his breaking up with me. It brought back a lot of feelings and I realized that i wasnt over him. And i know i have this wonderful boyfriend right now. and i like him a lot. but i feel like i should maybe try and focus more on God and people that can help me learn to know my Savior more.   Mike~ You never did one thing wronge in our relationship...you showed me how great someone can be to another. You showed me kindness more than i ever thought you would. I know I kept telling you to stay by my side...umm but i think i was really saying to me...but i didnt want to belive that i was the one with the problem. I know even if we arnt together we will meet and it will be amazing...ummm...You need to expirience having a girl that you can hold and touch and see into her eyes. I know that person is out there mike and you will fall in love with her. But i finally got the life i've wanted at home back and i'm soo excited cause i have the trust of my family back and i'm getting all these openings to wonderful opportunities. Everything i gave to you was true...but i couldnt give you the warmth of my heart or the warmth of my own hand. Your an amazing guy, and you will make someone very happy some day. Well you already have made someone happy...me...thanks for all that you did for me...i'm sorry i had to end what we had...and i'm sorry that i cant be there for you. But right now i need to focus on God and the people that can show me how to love him more than i do now. i need to get my life in a path that will show hope in my future. We will be friends forever and i will always be here if u need to talk to me. I'm sorry Mike!!!  Shawn thanks for your help with this..you helped me through a lot in my life! thanks soo much...I'm so glad i talked to u about this.. i know the chose i made was the right one...at least for right now lol thanks soo much!    Grant~you showed me how much God can bring life into me ....Thanks...and i'm glad you said you'd be there for me no matter what! thanks soo much! I'm glad we had that talk...it helped a lot   I'm soo sorry Mike  ~*~Kristin Nicole~*~  Hurt....

I hate doing that.. but why would i want to ruin the world she loves so dearly??!?!?! Well i hope i didnt give up a friend for something that isnt gunna last.. i'm sorry lindsey... but i dont want to deal with your boyfriend yelling at me and telling me how bad of a person i am.. i dont need anymore of that .. expecially from him.

      Alright, Today my boyfriend mike was doubting our relationship. See he lives a short distance away and he feels like we might not work out. I feel that if we both work together this will work out. I mean he means so much to me, and i dont think i could take him leaving me. He's so wonderful to me and showed me a whole diffrent side to me. He's such a great guy and has the best ways of making me feel so special. I know that he loves me but he was doubting our relationship and that hurts when a guy says that. He says that he thought about everything and that he loves me so much and doesnt want to lose me, and i love hearing that, but i also have that thought that he is thinking...omgose this isnt gunna work what am i doing? and i dont want to have him think that. cause he means the world to me and i love him. I will always love him no matter what happens and i dont want to lose him. I was balling my eyes out today and i just relized how much he truly means to me, and how much it hurts when someone says that they have doubts about ur realationship. anywayz...my Great Aunt also died and my dad jsut told me about it. I didnt really know her well but i mean she is apart of my life.. so idk   Anywayz...I love Mike and i will always be here for you!  Luv yall  XoXo ~*~Kristin Nicole~*~

      Yesterday Grant came over!!! I hadnt seen him in so long! it was an awesome day! Me and him took a walk in the rain, and we danced in the rain! TANGO! lol it was a good time. when he held me it felt so...perfect! Like when he held my hand, it seemed like it was meant to be! I cant really discribe it! He's so amazing! One thing i noticed was i was my self around him. I wasnt afraid to be me...which is sometimes hard for me to do. me and him hugged in the park for like 2 min...and all i could think about was... "this is so amazing! i never thought this would be come true" and "man i want to kiss him" but i didnt cause i thought i would wait for when he was ready! ahh i cant get over how amazing he is! I will wait as long as i have to, to be his girl! i want to be called his girl again so bad...but i will wait...and even if it doesnt happen i will be happy just to know i had those moments with him yesterday! well i'll write later...  He's so amazing!!!  ~*~Kristin~*~  could this be love? could i be falling even harder for him! ??!??!!?!?!?!?  God Bless <>

I still like him a lot, but i guess i have to move on...but i'm not willing to move on so fast...i think i'll lay low of dating for a long time...i told him i'd wait...and i want to stick to that....even tho.. now i know nothing will happen ever...he's still amazing. some how i knew this would happen but idk i set myself up for a heart break. But hey...it's ok i have ppl to talk to about it... JUSTIN!! lol he's always there to talk to...thanks so much.   well i have nothing to do the rest of the day, i might go to easton..maybe i'll get my 2nd holes done on my ears!!! well thats an idea!!! lol i hope i do...i want something for myself...maybe a guitar and some lessons..hmmm...I"M BROKE!!! or else i would!!!! lol well i'd like to thank Justin for helping me through this.

      well...yesterday and today have been pretty well rough...but the Lord helped me through them...Me and Grant arnt gunna get together anytime soon...But i like him so much and i'm willing to wait...he's an amazing guy and even if me and him never happen again, i'll be happy cause i've had those days with him...and i'll always be here for him. He's so easy to talk to...and i'm myself around him. Which a lot of you know thats hard for me. but if he isnt ready then i'm gunna respect that. I just pray that i do have another chance with him.   Well idk if any of yall have heard the song "Our Lives" by The Calling...but the song has such a good message about life...it's like all i listen to now lol  Is it love tonight When everyone's dreaming Of a better life In this world Divided by fear We've gotta believe that There's a reason we're here Yeah, there's a reason we're here  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  See the TRUTH all around Our FAITH can be broken And our hands can be bound But open our hearts and fill up the emptiness With nothing to stop us Is it not worth the risk? Yeah, is it not worth the risk?  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives Even if hope was shattered I know it wouldn't matter Cause these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  We can't go on Thinking it's wrong To speak our minds I've gotta let out what's inside  Is it love tonight When everyone's dreaming Can we get it right? Yeah, well can we get it right?  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives Even if hope was shattered I know it wouldn't matter Because these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  ~Life can be over real fast...I used to be suicidal and i was so close to taking the pills and ending my life. I had one of my best friends from UA kill himself...and it killed me and my friends...it's like killing yourself is a selfish act...and i've learned that...cause you think that you've solved your problems..but you caused other problems with famliy and friends.  I found out that you cant live life without the Lord by your side...he does amazing things that i never thought i could see or have in my life...for example...Today when Grant told me that we should wait...if i didnt have the Lord i would have been like "NO I WANT MY WAY" but now that i have the Lord it's like "okay i can wait...and give respect to Grant" so it's like you should focus on others more than yourself...I thought my life was over after EVERY bad thing that happened to...(a few months ago) but really it's just the begining!  you have to live life like you dont know whats to happen next...But always remember if you dont have Jesus in your future...you'll be going down a path to no where...a place no one is happy, and no one will ever help you through the tough times...haha i go to this brigde...well it used to be a bridge lol and i will sit there and look down and the creek or if it's night time i'll look up at the stars and talk to God. it really helps..he just has such a powerful friendship...i'm so glad i relized that i cant make it without him..cause honestly I feel i would have never met Grant if God didnt send him to me to show me i cant be without God, And i'm glad i almost had the chance with Grant again. He's amazing and i know he's serving God in the best way he can...i'm not gunna give up on him. I like him a lot and i want to show him how amazing of a person i can be...it just felt so perfect to be in his arms, like it was meant to be...i like him so much and i will wait for him...Even if i have to wait forever...  wow i'm in a very powerful mood today! :) so maybe things will work out for the best for me...i just hope i dont lose something i want to bad...  ::i wanna make you smile even when i cant make myself::  Well God Bless <>  ~*~Kristin Nicole~*~
