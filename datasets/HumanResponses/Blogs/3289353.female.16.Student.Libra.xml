      The coolest person i have in my family is my moms family. The reason i say this is because my moms family likes to have fun and likes to go out. Compare to my dads family they are so borring  and never want to go out. My moms family actually talks mess about my moms family cause they are outgoing and they love having fun i think its nothing but jealous people that have no life and have nothing to do but talk mess. I understand they are my dads parents and family but i just dont like them talking mess about my moms family and us cause evrything me and my sister is wrong for my dads family. I think that all my moms family are the coolest out of anybody cause evertime im with them i always have fun and spend all the time laughing.

      Ive been throught alot in my life specially when i was in middle school, i attended Jackson middle school that was a good school in a way and it was also bad.In that school i learned alot. When i got out of 5th grade i was alittle angel i didnt do anything bad and i did all my work, but once i got to jackson people started to change the way i was they started giving me bad influence and telling me to do all this thinkgs that werent good for me.I stayed in that school and i started getting in trouble and i never did my work, they use to call my parents and i didnt even care i use to talk back to my parents always being rude to them and i always ignore them i was real bad that i started hanging around with bad people that did drugs and all that. I passed my 3yrs in that school going throught good and bad stuff.One day i got to talk to people and got tell them what had happen to me during my middle school year they gave me good advice and i decided to change i realize all the bad things i did.  People always tell me to talk to my mom about this and tell her that i regret everything i did and for me to tell her how much i love her but as much as i try doing it i cant!
