      we actually did play today. we had fun doin 7 nation army. Max is a lot better than we thought he would be. The hard part is matching up random guitar parts with random drum parts. we'll probably play every week.

      we will finally start playin on wednesday at my house. i havent decided on a time yet though. well i found out that if i play really fast random high notes, it sounds like i know what im doin. if we want ,we can get custom t-shirts with band name and stuff, but for $20, and the catch is that we have to buy two each...

      As far as material to play, I have a few ideas already. Me and Alex have made riffs and my friend has lyrics, max probably has his own beats. "seven nation army" seems like a fairly easy song to play on everyones part, except Alex who cant get over the fact that im lead and hes rhythm, backup, bass, whatever you want to call it... im learnin "purple haze", but the solos are freakin impossible. The hilarious thing is that we could theoretically just have practice at Phil's. Think about it, we've got better amps,  better guitars, drums, and no parents (or brothers) to tell us to be quiet. It would be really cool to have gigs like birthday parties, school parties, other crap. If we get good enough, we could even make a few bucks $$$...                      ps...   alex's aim address is squierplaya4now, mine is shadownet00, and max's is fingersturkey67

      i    was in my car for like eight hours today, but i went to a guitar store..    that was cool...    apparently my dads old band was pretty good...       man, im just typing what ever the hell comes into my mind...  we still havent practiced. we were gonna today but then we didnt... when i asked max what we should name the band, he said "microwaveable" thats kind of strange but i dont know if i could stand tellin my friends at school "of yeah, im in a cool band, its microwavealbe!" i was thinkin today maybe we should be "albino blacksheep" or "blacksheep". The funny thing about the swim meet last night was that like everybody was sayin " we  should name   our   band ......" like they were even gonna be in our band. Conner kept on sayin "you guys could play in the backround of my movie where i get hurt a lot" (i like the part about him bein hurt but not goin to his house"     if your readin this please email me at shadownet00@nirvanaweb.com just so i can see whos goes to this site...

      I might find out what kind of gear Max uses and when we will start playing tonight at the swim meet. We still don't know what to do about vocals, though... who knows, maybe I'll be the singer(hahaha). Me and Alex have made numerous guitar riffs and short song parts for us to use in our songs. Adam is writing some songs for us to use (just words, no music). The song he is workin on right now is about his evil ceiling fan so our songs will probably have really strange...

      As lead guitarist, i play an Epiphone Les paul Special (red and yellow)through a Marshall amp. Alex plays a Squier Affinity Strat with a Fender Frontman 15g amp. Also, once it is fixed, Alex will play a vintage Hammond organ. I have no clue what kind of drums Max uses...  by the way, Max, if you're readin this tell me your gear and if you use aim or not.

      I'll bet only like two people have read this because our band has yet to have been formed. The band, yet to be named (maybe "Orphan"), is Charlie(me!) on lead guitar, Alex on backup and rythym guitar and keyboards, and Max on drums. This will be a heavy, classic, and fairly good rock band (well, i cant really say were good cause we havent even started). So anyways, I"ll be postin once the band is started or if I have something to say...
