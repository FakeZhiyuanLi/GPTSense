      In politics there are certain goals, such as a "balanced budget" or "energy independence," that are so lofty that any politician who promises them is talking nonsense and deserves the mute button. Something similar should happen in religious debate to people who talk about "Torah-based" Judaism.  That is the chimera Dennis Prager calls for in this month's Moment magazine. He believes it&nbsp;"could bring vast numbers of non-religious Jews to Judaism." Specifically, Prager calls for a "Torah-based Judaism which honors rabbinic law but doesn't deify it," which, at a moment's glance, seems to make a dash of sense. Certainly it doesn't describe any of&nbsp;three major&nbsp;branches of Judaism; all three claim to&nbsp;take both the Torah seriously, but take cues from it selectively and are inspired primarily by the Talmud.  Prager correctly cites several instances where&nbsp;modernity has made&nbsp;a mockery of rabbinic law: "I see no reason to believe that&nbsp;kosher food is rendered non-kosher because the clean dish on which it is served to me once had non-kosher food on it." Of course, there is no good reason to believe this. But neither is there&nbsp;any good reason to believe, as Prager apparently does, that nothing in&nbsp;the last 3,000 years&nbsp;- not refrigeration technology, or the germ theory of disease, or the&nbsp;use of more sanitary eating utensils - renders any of the Torah's commandments about kashruth&nbsp;obsolete. Only rabbinic law may be questioned, because the Torah is&nbsp;"God-based."  OK, Prager.&nbsp;The holidays will be here soon. If the Torah is God's law, and you're serious about following it, do what the Torah says you should do to celebrate. Take an unblemished ox or whatever to a kohen and have it sacrificed on&nbsp;an altar.&nbsp;But we don't have a temple. Nu? Neither did the Hebrews to whom the Torah was given. They were wandering around the Sinai peninsula, so presumably the&nbsp;slashing and burning&nbsp;needn't be done in Jerusalem.&nbsp;Local ordinances might not permit doing this in, say, Skokie, but you can always drive out to the country, which seems a minor inconvenience compared to ignoring divine revelation.  I doubt Prager will do this. I assume he will instead drive to synagogue (he doesn't believe the Torah prohibits that; not surprising, since the Torah doesn't contemplate synagogues, let alone motorized vehicles).   Prager, of course, is not calling for animal sacrifice, although presumably he&nbsp;would if he really believed in the Torah&nbsp;as&nbsp;the literal word of God.&nbsp;What he wants is continued second-class status for gays within Judaism, because that is what is called for in "3,000 years of Jewish teaching." The rules of kashruth he dismisses haven't stood the test of time, apparently, dating only to the sixth century. So he disdains Conservative rabbis who "believe that preserving an extra day of yom tov is more urgent that preserving marriage as a man-woman institution."  No wonder Prager is uncomfortable in any of Judaism's major branches - he is liberal on angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin questions such as whether chicken is meat ("though chickens can no more produce milk than fish can"), but reactionary on the rights of actual people. As I said, it makes sense at a moment's glance, but only at a moment's.

       FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) Everybody knows nobody gets eliminated after a solo date, so Josh agreed to pay $275,000 of his $500,000 for one with Rachel. They saw a string quartet, so at least they were with people, unlike the weirdly empty beach and casino the guys on the group dates went to. It looked like a good buy until the limo ride home, when Josh started taking dating tips from Pepe Le Pew. Rachel, the scandalized ingenue, felt "mauled" and sent him home, along with Rudy and Alex.  WHO WANTS TO MARRY MY DAD  (Monday, 10 p.m., NBC 4) The dates and competitions are boring. Let's just sit everyone down for coffee, bring in their ex-boyfriends and hear the most embarrassing stories about these women we can find. They took a step in that direction this week, bringing up two "bad facts" about each of the remaining contestants. Suzanne and Stacy escaped relatively unscathed. Marilyn, we learned, once dated two guys on the same day and was once married and divorced in the same weekend. They did the polygraph thing and all that, but there was no point after the Marilyn revelations. She was toast.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) The contestants' task this week was to pitch a sitcom to a focus group. They had two hours to prepare their pitch, which had to be at least as long as it took to come up with "Joey." Tammy Pescatelli won with her pitch of " 'The Sopranos' meets 'Mama's Family.' " Would she have an act if her last name was O'Malley? (Yes. It would be about her family of alcoholic New York City cops.) The ejected contestants came back (stop us if you've heard this before) and got to vote for who would go on stage. John got four votes and challenged Corey, and in a second vote Alonzo was chosen for a three-way battle. Corey didn't put up much of a fight, getting sent home with 7 percent of the vote.  BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.; Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) Marvin put Lori and Holly up for elimination, but, judging by their joint bath, Holly had an ally in Jase. She might be the Yoko who breaks up the Four Horsemen. Even after Holly got disgusted with Jase's general obnoxiousness, he took her off the block when he won the power of veto. Marvin replaced her with Karen, breaking up the Lori/Karen/Will alliance. Nakomis got bored with changing her hair color and got a mohawk. CBS gives these people no food, but they have enough hair-care products for a Jessica Simpson world tour. Lori got voted out, and Drew is the new head of household.  NEXT ACTION STAR  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) Jared and Melisande went on a date, but their plans to become the next Hollywood power couple are complicated by the fact that Jared has a girlfriend back home. Which is where they'll be soon if they don't stop blowing screen tests. But give Melisande credit for realizing that her best chance at Hollywood stardom is to get there the old-fashioned way: sleeping her way to the top. Corinne and Sean look like the favorites at this point, with everybody else destined for community theater. Mark was an easy pick to leave, with Mae going home mainly to keep the Melisande-Jared drama going.  THE ULTIMATE LOVE TEST  (season finale) Amber has decided she's not happy with Diego. Heather is through with Frank: "Even if he asked me to marry him, I would say no." (This is known as foreshadowing.) So what do Frank and Diego do? Buy rings. Diego and Amber had a teary, piano-accompanied reunion in which Diego professed his love and auditioned for a daytime soap opera. Roy was quickly forgotten. Frank had an emotional reunion in which he proposed to Heather. And she accepted. (This is known as irony.) Those couples are still together, but Jayre and Carolyn called it quits.

      Jonah Goldberg is a disturbing columnist. As a Democrat, you hope he's not right, but you often wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat wondering if he is.   He's frighteningly perceptive in  urlLink this piece &nbsp;comparing John Kerry and Bob Dole. Of course, every presidential election inevitably gets compared to every other recent presidential election, and the one lesson history always teaches is that history only repeats itself until it doesn't. But there are reasons to think Jonah might be right.   And, not incidentally, that I was right. I have thought since the night of the Iowa caucuses that Democrats were out of their collective minds to nominate this mediocre careerist who could only dream of having the legislative accomplishments of Bob Dole. But what's done is done, it cannot be undone, and fight the real enemy and all that. So  urlLink go Kerry, I guess .   Jonah's point is that a lot of Democrats are adding "I guess" to the end of their slogans this year. It isn't just a lack of charisma that haunts Kerry, although there is that. Not all recent presidents were kings of the homecoming court. It's that, having no identifiable rationale for his candidacy other than to better his resume, he inspires little loyalty and less enthusiasm.   Don't get me wrong - a country that makes "Fahrenheit 9/11" the media event of the year is not lacking in left-wing passions. But the passion is not for Kerry, it is against Bush. Judging from approval ratings, and Michael Moore's box-office receipts, about half of Americans would vote for a pet rock over Bush. So just imagine how a real candidate could do.   This doesn't look like an evenly divided country anymore. It looks like a country with a hard-core minority of Bush supporters, an even bigger cadre of Bush bashers and a small slice in the middle that wouldn't mind throwing the bum out, if only there were a real president to take his place.   A&nbsp;candidate of presidential timber&nbsp;would unite those latter two groups to forge a landslide win in November. Kerry still has time to do this, so it's still too early to print up the "Don't blame me, I voted for Lieberman" bumper stickers. But remember, I had the idea first.

      If same-sex partners of Ohio State employees have health benefits six months from now, it will be partly&nbsp;because of the kindness of the religious right. Malfeasance by the university's Board of Trustees almost certainly has given opponents of gay rights the a  bility to delay giving the benefits, and it would be shocking if they don't.  &nbsp;  That's because it is now certain that the decision to offer same-sex benefits was hammered out behind closed doors before the regular Board of Trustees meeting, when the board approved it unanimously without any debate or prior announcement. The university has admitted holding private&nbsp;"briefings" at which trustees asked questions of university President Karen Holbrook, and that board members discussed issues with each other on a one-on-one basis.  &nbsp;  Wednesday, Attorney General Jim Petro - the university's official legal counsel - said, as all his recent predecessors have, that both practices violate the state's open meetings law. The university denied this both before and after Petro's warning, preferring its own unique interpretation of the law to that of the state's chief law enforcement official. But out of the goodness of their hearts - or, "in the spirit of openness," as a university spokeswoman put it (where was that spirit last week?), all future private "briefings" are hereby canceled.  &nbsp;  But the briefings, which the university says are perfectly legitimate and will stop immediately,&nbsp;are only half the problem. Said Petro: "Back-to-back or 'round-robin' meetings of less than a majority of the board in which public business is discussed prior to a public meeting is a violation of the (Open Meetings) Act."  &nbsp;  Said the OSU spokeswoman: "Both the board chair and the president believe that communication with individual board members is essential. Such conversations are not a substitute for meetings."  &nbsp;  But in this case, a substitute for meetings is exactly what they were; they were the only times the trustees ever discussed same-sex benefits before voting on them.  &nbsp;  In a letter to the  Columbus Dispatch , Holbrook said that same-sex benefits have been talked about in committee meetings and in the media, and that other universities have them, and that she and previous presidents have supported same-sex benefits, and lots of other things that won't help the university if it gets sued. What she did not say is that the trustees did not hold illegal meetings, or that any trustee ever said one word about same-sex benefits in a public meeting before voting on them.  &nbsp;  When Ohio University and Miami University provided same-sex benefits to their employees, members of the Caveman Caucus in the Legislature complained they were violating the "spirit" of the state's symbolic Defense of Marriage Act. Here, Ohio State violated both the spirit and the letter of the ostensibly nonsymbolic open meetings law. If conservatives don't try to do anything about that, what are conservatives for?

       FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) Fifteen guys showed up to meet Rachel and Andrea, pretty much like the women who met Preston, only with more tank tops and hair products. This time, the men got to see their checks, so they knew how much they were playing for. No, John Kerry was not one of the contestants. Steve made a production out of turning his back on the amount ($1). Andrea greeted Rachel with her usual courtesy: "I'm guessing he didn't choose you." The men had to vote on which woman to keep and, amazingly, it came down to the last man. He lined up behind Rachel, sending home Andrea and the seven men who backed her (including the self-righteous Steve).   WHO WANTS TO MARRY MY DAD  (Monday, 10 p.m., NBC 4) The announcement that the series would end with a wedding would have freaked us out - as it did Marty - but the women took it in stride. While the daughters watched on a hidden camera, of course. Melanie said she once got married to a guy she knew for three weeks. And her bad fact was about ketchup? Convinced that all the women were sufficiently desperate (or devoted - whatever), the daughters announced the wedding news was a hoax. But everybody went dress shopping anyway. Nicole got booted in the daughters' last easy decision, and Melanie was the second one out.   LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) The contestants' task this week was to entertain a group of kids, using props and costumes. Being a clown doesn't look that hard, but apparently there's a clown college for a reason, because these folks bombed. The kids hated Kathleen the least and gave her immunity. Jay put on a skirt and called himself "flamboyant," which didn't work for ANT and didn't work for him. Jay and Gary tied in the challenge vote, but it was no contest when they took the stage. Jay put on his usual persona - Steven Wright, if Steven Wright slept under a bridge. The audience's reaction was colder and quieter than Steven is. Gary won his second straight joke-off with 89 percent of the vote.   BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.;  Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) The Four Horsemen spelled apocalypse for Mike. After Jase put him up for elimination and Scott won the power of veto, Mike went to work against the ruling junta. This is dangerous business. He almost escaped when Adria and Diane made themselves a threat by trying to form a female alliance, but Mike's ineffectual scheming got him sent home in a rare unanimous vote. It's hard to see how one man can make so many enemies so quickly. It's also hard to see how the Horsemen can keep control of the house for three months. Marvin is the new HoH.   NEXT ACTION STAR  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) Only on reality TV does a team get rewarded for incompetence. The team of Mae, Melisande, Mark and Jared was so bad that the casting team couldn't pick only two of them to boot. So kept everyone around for another week. In unrelated developments, Jared was spotted in bed with Melisande. This is starting to sound like Toby Goldstein's column.   THE ULTIMATE LOVE TEST  (Wednesday, 10 p.m., ABC 6) You didn't really think the series would end this week, did you? We learned why Amber is so desperate to get out of Vermont when she reveals she's never been to an art gallery. Isn't she, like, a photographer or something? But then she said she's never been to a hair salon, either. C.R. took Heather to his apartment. So far, so good. Then he broke out the naughty pictures of her from their last stint together. And suddenly Frank was back in the game. You know the rest: The women got teary, the men started sweating, and we'll get their decisions next week.

      Ohio State University's decision last week to offer health benefits to same-sex partners of its employees was a step toward equality for gay citizens, and probably a smart business decision for the university.  But only if the school followed democratic procedures and state law in ratifying its decision - otherwise, it risks bringing the university a lawsuit that would leave domestic partner benefits in legal limbo. Something smelled fishy on Friday when the university's Board of Trustees voted unanimously, with no prior notice, and without debate, to extend benefits to same-sex domestic partners of faculty and staff members and their children.  The Columbus Dispatch  the next day said that "board members did not see the proposal until seconds before they voted on the nearly $1 million annual expense." Well, not quite. Actually, the board met privately just before the public meeting. And no debate was necessary, university officials said, because university President Karen Holbrook met individually with the trustees to discuss the proposal beforehand. With few exceptions, Ohio law requires public bodies, such as a university board of trustees, to meet only in public at preannounced times. A board's action can be voided by a court if it was precipitated by illegal meetings. Virginia Tretheway, an attorney for the board, called the private meeting a "briefing session," and produced unintentionally hilarious sentence in the  Dispatch : "She said there were no discussions and that members asked questions and listened to administrators talk." The Board of Trustees' world, in which questions and answers by key university decision-makers about crucial university business are not "discussions," is also one where board members have obligations other than to the taxpayers they work for. The board also "is there to support our president and administration," said board Chairwoman Tami Longaberger. It could be called the Ohio State University/Enron Board of Trustees. Another trustee said the board never votes on anything unless a unanimous vote is guaranteed. Longaberger could not recall a dissenting vote in her eight years on the board. It could be called the Ohio State University Politburo. All of this is probably illegal - certainty is elusive under Ohio's byzantine open meetings laws - but it definitely smells rank, and provides ammunition - legal and rhetorical - for those who oppose same-sex partner benefits. So here are some proposals for the board to discuss (if they'll forgive the term) at its next open meeting: First, establish a policy forbidding - as Ohio law seems to - serial meetings between trustees and administrators that hammer out policy in private. Then, consider hiring legal counsel who knows and respects Ohio's meetings law. That way, the next time the board takes a controversial stand, it won't risk setting back the very cause it is trying to advance.

       FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) We'll spare you the agonizing - for the women and the viewer - prelude that filled most of the hour. Preston chose PJ, Rachel freaked out, then found out she was worth $1 million, then freaked out some more, then got over it. PJ, whose golden hair is symbolic of her golden heart, of course chose Preston over the money. Preston also spurned the check in favor of PJ, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, until we read of their breakup in People magazine. Two weeks later, Rachel came back to join 15 men - and Andrea - in the next season of "FLOM."  WHO WANTS TO MARRY MY DAD  (Monday, 10 p.m., NBC 4) Marty took the ladies skeet shooting. When they had weapons in their hands, the safest thing to be was a clay pigeon. The least safe thing to be was a contestant, as they had "bad facts" revealed about them when they missed, such as that Tammy doesn't want to change her name when she gets married (imagine!) and Melanie eats ketchup by the bowlful. The girls, who are looking for a mom - dad is an afterthought - immediately sent Tammy home. Marty said he wanted to spend more time with Marylin and ditch Nicole. So the girls put Marylin in the polygraph, before ditching Sharon.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) Milton Berle is dead. Alan King is dead. Buddy Hackett is dead. So they went to the B-list of old-school comics to judge a roast of Jay London - Norm Crosby, Phyllis Diller and Rich Little. They liked Alonzo, but thought Gary worked too blue (for a roast?). Jay got immunity for letting himself be viciously insulted. ANT and his colony voted en masse for Gary. Bad move. Seeking revenge for the expulsion of Todd, Gary took on ANT and beat him with 73 percent of the vote.  BIG BROTHER  (Tuesday, 9 p.m., Thursday, 8 p.m, CBS 10) The 13 guests who moved into the house included Michael, who wears a cowboy hat to brush his teeth, and Jennifer, who announced that she prefers to be called "Nakomis," which means "daughter of the moon" (a word that means something similar is "lunatic"). As they talked about their famililes, Michael realized he and Nakomis had the same father. Nakomis thought that was trippy. Jase became Head of Household and exercised his authority by making the men wear women's underwear. Even more shocking was that the women agreed to this. Then he put up Mike and Nakomis for elimination. It was a major buzzkill.  NEXT ACTION STAR  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) The ten remaining contestants got advice from NASCAR driver Jack Sprague on high-speed driving, and from Denise Richards on whatever it is she does. Jared won the right to redo his scene, in which he was tied to Linda. They were both lousy in both takes, but Jared had shown enough previously to get another chance. Linda and House were sent home.  THE ULTIMATE LOVE TEST  (Wednesday, 10  p.m., ABC 6) While Heather and C.R. looked ready to live happily ever after, Frank decided he and Heather should live together. So even though he worried about "disappointing" his parents by moving out of their house (we suspect they'll get over it), he hauled all his worldly possessions over to Heather's apartment. Meanwhile, it looked increasingly likely that Amber will never see Vermont again, let alone Diego. That whack on the head Jayre got last week must have reminded him just how whipped he is, because he turned down a chance to go to Vegas with his three hotties and instead went home to Jersey. Carolyn was unenthralled at first, but he wore her down with gifts of flowers, cheesecake and his testicles. They forfeited the $100,000, but no doubt will share a blissful, passive-aggressive future.

      As long as I'm answering fan mail, I thought I'd add a note about "The Amazing Race." I agree with my correspondent that it is one of the better reality shows out there, and in retrospect I wish I had added it to my column. However, when the season debuted, I was already covering five shows, and "Big Brother" started the same week. I don't have room to cover seven shows (remember, Reality Check goes in a newspaper, not just on this blog), and I didn't want to drop a show I'd been covering all season, so I had to pick one new show to add. I chose "BB" because it has a more linear storyline and, if I'm not mistaken, a bigger audience. If I had planned better in advance, I would have ignored "Next Action Star" and saved room for "TAR," but on the list of my job duties, following the schedule of upcoming reality shows doesn't make the top 10. If I'm still writing this column next year, well, I'll probably blow my brains out, but if I don't do that, I'll definitely cover "The Amazing Race."

      Remember George W. Bush's "fuzzy math?" A few Dems are breaking that out to prove that their convention wasn't the flop it looked like.  My friend Pedro (see the comment on "Kerry's convention thud") went medieval on my buttocks for suggesting the Democrats' shindig went over like a whore at the parish picnic. I will address his points in the order he makes them:  1) No journalist complains about not being spoon-fed the news. The problem with conventions is that their only purpose is to spoon-feed news to the media, in supersized commodities. That's exactly what makes them not news, but advertising. And I've never even been to a Georgetown cocktail party.  2) Pedro is being very generous as describing anything in Kerry's speech as a "principle." Sentences that begin "I will not" do not count; they say nothing about how he will govern. His critique of the war was good but somehow never mentioned that he voted for it, let alone why, so we're still left guessing if he believes what he said about making decisions of war and peace. To summarize the rest: He's in favor of jobs, health care, old people and puppies (OK, I made that one up).  3) It matters not what George Will, Brit Hume or I think of the speech; it matters that it did nothing, Pedro's Web sites notwithstanding, to move Kerry's poll numbers up. If he gained support in some states after the convention, that means he lost support elsewhere, because I have yet to see a national poll, based on likely voters, registered voters, adults, Belgians or whatever, that showed a statistically significant bounce for Kerry. Yes, Bush's poll numbers are horrendous, and got worse after the convention — which I noted in my original column. That only makes it sadder that Kerry has such a small lead. (For the record: In the week after the convention, he was up 3 points by AP/Ipsos, tied by Marist College, up 6 by ABC/Washington Post, up 5 by CBS News and down 4 by CNN/USA Today/Gallup. The numbers are a little better if you exclude Nader, but that's less realistic and still doesn't get him more than a 6 point lead in any poll.) A real candidate would be up by 10 points and pulling away.  4) Finally, about my biases. They're clear to most people who know me, but so there's no confusion, I will vote for Kerry and November, and I predict he will win. Out of the six major Democratic candidates for president, he was my sixth-favorite, partly because I thought he would be as inept a campaigner as he has proven to be (although mostly because of his lack of a position on the war). I criticize him in the same spirit that baseball fans criticize a manager when their team isn't winning enough. You don't stop rooting for the team; you just wish they'd do better. Since the Iowa caucuses, I've been consistent in wishing the Democrats would do better.

      The Democratic National Convention won rave reviews from the media. So did "De-Lovely." Have  you  seen it yet? For all the claims that John Kerry's coronation went off without a hitch (other than the a stage manager cursing into an open mic), this convention will be remembered as a warp in the political space-time continuum. The Democrats held a four-day informercial, and after the confetti was swept up, it was as though they had done nothing at all. A staple of election years past has been the "convention bounce," the boost in the polls that a even a weak candidate gets after his convention. Bob Dole became competitive after his convention, despite facing a popular incumbent and having the charisma of a rice cake. Walter Mondale's convention was electrifying, featuring a keynote address by Mario Cuomo that was the best many political veterans say they have ever heard. Even Michael Dukakis led after his convention. John Kerry's convention had all the bounce of a brick. Before the convention, Kerry's support was in the 46 to 49 percent range in most polls. Afterward, it was in the 46 to 49 percent range. At least one poll actually showed a bounce for President Bush. Bush's approval ratings, overall and on his handling of the economy, dipped a little - not a lot - but if Bush was a little scuffed up at the end of the week, Kerry hardly looked any more polished. Some of this was caused by factors beyond Kerry's control. The major television networks have drastically cut their convention coverage. (Political professionals, having made sure to purge the conventions of any newsworthy content, now lecture the networks on their "responsibility" to cover what has become a four-day group hug.) The electorate is remarkably polarized for so early in an election year, leaving fewer persuadable voters. Also, Kerry drained his convention of excitement by choosing his running mate weeks in advance, and by naming the well-known John Edwards. Most recent nominees have chosen lesser-known running mates closer to the convention; what looked to the pollsters like a convention bounce may actually have come from introducing the running mate to the nation. Edwards required, and received, no such introduction. Still, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the convention that went over well in Washington didn't play in Pleasantville. Keynote speaker Barack Obama - who might as well change his name to Rising Star Barack Obama - looked dynamic partly on the strength of his own speech, and partly in comparison to the mediocrities who surrounded him. Edwards, on the ticket only because of his ability to work a crowd, disappointed even media cheerleaders. Teresa Heinz Kerry ("Today, the better angels of our nature are just waiting to be summoned.") should have remembered the maxim that people look to clerics, not politicians, for moral guidance. As for John Kerry ... He wasn't nominated for his spellbinding oratory. But a minimum expectation for a presidential candidate is that he at least give us some idea of what he might do as president. Of the 112 paragraphs in his speech, three contained something that resembled a policy proposal. One was self-contradictory: to add 40,000 active-duty troops to "strengthen American forces that are now overstretched" but simultaneously "end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists." One was reckless - to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission "immediately." And the third, to raise taxes on the wealthy, is just what everyone expects from a Democrat. What in this was bounce-worthy?" America can do better. And help is on the way," Kerry said. He's right. But it was Obama's speech, not Kerry's, that proves it.

       FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) It was four-date day, with Rachel getting the opportunity to take multiple dates with one guy if she chose. Mike, David and Caleb got the first three dates, so when Rachel called Mike back for the final one, Morgan started to sweat, and for a different reason than the last time he dated Rachel. Who's in the lead? Whoever Rachel saw last, as far we can tell. Mike's pretty comfortable, but so was Morgan last week. This week he got booted and the last $1 million check went into the fireplace.  WHO WANTS TO MARRY MY DAD  (season finale) Expenses for this show included rings, evening gowns and Gatorade to prevent dehydration from all the crying. The show needed conflict, and a villain, so Suzanne confronted Stacy, saying Marilyn would have been a better runner-up. The lie-detector tests hit a new low when Stacy proclaimed she would gnaw off her own leg if she and Marty would caught in a bear trap (she passed). We would rather put them in a bear trap and make her prove it. That would be something to cry about. Marty made it clear he wanted to marry Stacy. The girls thought Suzanne would make a better stepmother. For once, they listened to Dad and chose Stacy. Suzanne went home in tears, Stacy wept with joy, and the girls cried because they're saps.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) Getting sent home were Kathleen Madigan, who got this far mainly by not having to perform, Jay London, whose one-liners were one line too many, and Tammy Pescatelli, because we've heard her one joke quite enough, thank you. The final three are John Heffron, Gary Gulman and Alonzo Bodden.  BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.; Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) Diane became HoH and went straight to the heart of the Four Horsemen, putting Scott and Jase on the block. But Jase won the veto and was replaced by Marvin, setting up Adria as the swing vote. She was lobbied by the Horsemen and Diane's girls - Nakomis and Will. She cast her lot with the ladies, sending Scott out 4-3. After the vote, in came Adria's twin, Natalie.  THE PLAYER  (Tuesday, 9 p.m., UPN 53) Finally, a new take on the reality dating show! Just kidding. This is "The Bachelorette" with a hop-hop soundtrack. In their first attempts to impress the star, Dawn, and her "girls," Jinelle and Ananda, the 13 guys used 45 seconds for performances that ranged from freestyle rap to jumping in the pool. Federico was generally obnoxious, but Dawn was most annoyed when he corrected her pronunciation of his name. What you're supposed to say is: "It's beautiful how you say my name like that. It's not right, but it's beautiful." Live and learn. Federico can try that on his next playee, because he got booted.  AMISH IN THE CITY  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., UPN 53) This week's borrowings from other reality shows included the fight over a messy bathroom (pioneered by "The Real World") and visits to a horse farm ("The Simple Life") and race track (most recently, "Who Wants to Marry My Dad"). Arrested Development performed after the races. Yes, they're still doing "Tennessee," and the Amish liked the religious theme. They were split on the non-Amish church they went to, however.

       FOR LOVE OR MONEY  (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC 4) Mike is the odd bird of this group, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a tank top. The guys had draw a portrait of Rachel to win a solo date. Mike drew a rose growing out of concrete to symbolize something or other, and was genuinely surprised when he didn't win. Then he threw an archery competition to let his friend Caleb get alone time with Rachel. But when Morgan (with his portrait) won the right to switch his check with somebody else's, it was Mike who told him Caleb had $1 million. Guess who Morgan switched with. In a convenient slip-up, Rachel called Morgan "Jordan," and the guys got an inkling that she might know she's playing "FLOM." Morgan vaulted into the lead in lovin' as well as cash, and Chris was sent home.  LAST COMIC STANDING  (Tuesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., NBC 4) It was wild-card week, and the five booted contestants competed for the chance to get back in the game. No surprise that the underrated Bonnie McFarlane finished last and the unfunny Corey Holcomb was next to last. ANT was a disappointing third, and the one voted into the final six was ... Jay London? Well, if Carrot Top can have a career, we guess he can too.  BIG BROTHER  (Saturday, 9 p.m.; Tuesday, 9 p.m.; Thursday, 8 p.m.; CBS 10) We suspected Holly would be the Four Horsemen's Yoko Ono, and we looked more right than ever when Drew put Holly and Nakomis up for elimination. The mortar holding the alliance together crumbled some more when Scott started flirting with Holly, and Jase walked in on them. Nakomis won the veto and was replaced on the block by Adria. It looked like Marvin would cast the swing vote. Then Jase was spotted on the spy screen kissing Holly, and her fate was sealed. She went out 7-1, and we'll give you one guess who the dissenting vote was. The HoH competition was ongoing at the end of Thursday's show.  NEXT ACTION STAR  (season finale) NBC was so excited by this show that it couldn't wait to get to the end, so it skipped an episode and aired the finale this week. Melisande and John were booted in the lost episode, leaving four at the start of this week. Nobody wanted to work with Jared, making the casting card crucial. But when Corinne won it and chose Sean, they ended up bickering more than Jared did with any of his partners. But come screen-test time, Jeanne blew the fight scene, Jared struggled with his leather pants, and Corinne and Sean won the starring roles.  AMISH IN THE CITY  (Wednesday, 8 p.m., UPN 53) "You think you're gonna be living in this dope house, you're gonna be partying, you're gonna be hooking up, and Amish people show up?" Thus did city chick Meagan introduce "Amish in the City," the world's first Amishploitation show. Actually, this is probably one of the least exploitative reality shows, as the young Amish adults brought to Los Angeles to live with six city kids are going through their  rumspringa , a traditional coming-of-age period in which they experience the outside world and decide whether to return to the Amish life. What better way to send them running back to the farm than put them on a UPN show? But, at least at the start, they were pretty excited about living in a dope house, partying and hooking up. This week, the producers borrowed from every other reality show ever aired, giving the farm kids makeovers, taking them to the beach and revealing that Miriam and Randy are a former couple.
