      Ok, it's been a few days. Here's the summary:  * Went back to IKEA - Bought proper desk and built it  * Went to work at LONI - Went to meeting and talked to the point of embarrassment >_  * Tried to figure out how to go to the Offspring concert on Sunday with my cousin - Half-Failed :-( Not quite though :-D... :- * Found out that I weigh 147 pounds - I'm ~5'9"  * Volunteered at Hospital - No, Jessica wasn't there :-( (4/16)  * More math as usual  So yeah... life's boring. It'd be less boring if something went REALLY wrong. Well, come to think of it, it'd probably be more interesting if something went REALLY right (like me getting into MIT or Jessica dumping whoever she's going out with for my non-jewish ass). I'd probably walk around for a few weeks confused regarding what I did to make it all work. Anyway, it's not as bad as I make it out to be. I just work a lot and go for the unattainable but from what I hear, it builds character and mylinates axons. That alone is sexy enough a reason for me to keep workin'.         -- Fea'

      Today:  * Did some more math -- Algebra II (I'm not behind or anything, IMP just has it all spread out)  * Called orthodontist -- Tried to change appointment and failed  * Went to LONI -- talked to Rebecca, calculated some volumes, did some other stuff  * Went to IKEA -- bought a desk and a couple lamps and some other small things  * Came home -- Started building desk  * Got a call from Babak -- He just called and yelled at me, partially justified, but still. I mean, who calls just to yell at them and not hear them out? Jackass -.-  * Realized something was wrong -- We bought the wrong desk after building half of it. >_  In conclusion, not a bad day for the most part but it could have been better. I mean, !jeez! that phone call alone can ruin anyone's day especially when I wasn't as wrong as he said I was. Grrr. Yes, that was a period, not an exclamation point(!).      -- Fea'

      Today:    * Two point five weeks of math done in six hours. -- Is the book as effective? I doubt it but I need it done.    * Printed like 6 neuroscience papers, but ran out of ink on the 7th of 9 -- I'll read 'em later.    * Didn't load DICOMs with Java Applet -- I'm not surprised though. I didn't put any time into it.    * Practiced Guitar -- Bothered sister, Broke a pick, and I've almost mastered the G and C chords! Watch out, rock and roll hall of fame! Here I come!    * Set up AudioScrobbler Thingy -- Check it out here: http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/TheGermic/    * Drank a lot of various fluids -- And subsequently pissed like 9 times today    * Hugged mommy -- :-)    * Wrote some e-mails  All in all, it's been a pretty boring day. I listened to a lot of music as usual, I worked a lot as usual, I occupied a good chunk of my day with random stuff as usual. Yep... I think it's been a pretty boring day, but at least it wasn't a bad day... Well, kinda -_-          -- Fea'

      Here's the gist of it: I feel physically and somewhat mentally exhausted, but I feel extremely restless inside. My parents are getting divorced and I swear it's taking its toll on all of us. I try not to let it effect me but there's only so much I can do. To compound my anxiety, I have those SATs coming up on the 5th of June, which reminds me that I have to write Rebecca an E-mail saying that I can't make it for the next couple of weeks because I need to study for the stupid thing.  I don't like work, I don't like play, I don't like family, I don't like 90% of my life but that's a lot to ask for. I don't think that most people like their lives, but they take what given to them and make the best of it. I've got to try and look at things positively and look at what I do have and try not to focus on what I don't have, and if I do focus on it, not just whine about it, but try to fix it as well. It's not always easy, but no one has it easy. Everyone's got their set of shit.  The 10% of my life that I find enjoyable is the time that I spend with friends and my guitar. There is nothing I value more than a couple good friends. While my cousin Peter is technically family, I consider him more of a friend than a relative. I have to worry about what I say in front of my relatives because of what they might think and how it might reflect on my parents and whatnot. With friends I don't have to do that. They accept me and my beliefs for what they are and don't BLAME anyone else for my position. I wish everyone was like that.  I've known only two people in my life so far who I could trust like that. The first one was Shannon, my ex-girlfriend. She single-handedly helped me grow more than anyone else that I could name. I cared for her deeper than anyone before and to this day, still love and care for her. There is so much that I wish didn't do and so much that I wish I did. I miss her. The other is Peter. My relationship with Peter isn't so deep, or perhaps is deeper just subliminal. He's great to hang out with because he doesn't judge me. He listens, sometimes disagrees, is almost always funny, and has a marvelous singing voice (not really >_  NOTE: If family isn't listed, that doesn't imply that they're a friend or anything like that. If they're listed, they deserved it. If you're not listed, too bad, this is the truth.  ANOTHER NOTE: I'm not listing buddies. I'm listing true friends.  Here's a short list of my friends: Peter Peggy  Here's a short list of former friends: Shannon  Here's a short list of semi-friends: Sara Dan Ali  Here's a short list of people with whom I want to be friends: David Damian Charlie Maria Megan Jessica Monica Joe Leslie Fiona Jim (Added on June 2nd) Kat (Added on June 2nd) Lauren (Added on June 4th) Jenni... or is it Jenny or neither? I don't know, she's a Kaiser (Added on June 2nd) Everyone in the world who doesn't have an evil agenda.  Perhaps what I need is a girlfriend or "significant other". Then again, maybe I don't need a girlfriend or "significant other". I think I just need a person who I can trust with anything and everything, someone who will both listen and talk, someone who wont judge me, someone who will always be there for a favor, and in return I would always reciprocate. I don't care on the gender, but those are all things that are a must for me in a life-mate. Again, that's a lot to ask for though. I have it good and shouldn't bother with what I don't have.  In conclusion, life will always be harder than you want it to be and if it's not, you're either doing something wrong, mentally challenged, are in the top one ninth gajillionth percent of the population, or just haven't waiting long enough. Be patient, it'll get to you sooner or later. For those who never see it, I congratulate you.  One line: Parents getting divorced, SAT on 6/5, work sucks, life's hard, it never ends, it's that way for most people as far as I know.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      Haddockbites and Codshoes! Siphmonkies!  Ok, those were all made up explitives that are surprisingly effective. I no longer need to say "shit" or "fucktonkies", which is also made up. It's great, people get the idea that I'm pissed and I don't seem as unrefined. It's like a half-win, win situation, which I guess would be a 3/4 win situation.  Anyway, nothing happened today. I woke up at like 7AM after going to bed at like 4AM reinstalling my OS after accidentally breaking the kernel to oblivion. Man, I was tired last night. I was looking through my directories and finding out what needed to replaced when I thought "damn, I'm really tired. My eyes are closing by themselves and my fingers are sitting on the keys when they should be floating... I want to sleep but I have to get this done so that tomorrow morning I will think it never happened." And then it hit me "Man, I am a now a loser along more than one axis. I broke my kernel because I didn't know how to 'fix' it 'properly', I obviously have no social life becuase I'm sitting in front of a black console with green text at 4AM, and I don't know my limit. This sucks." But then I changed my perspective. I was like "Hmm, perhaps I'm not as big a loser as I thought. I actually TRIED to understand my computer better and break it without damaging it. A lot can be said for people who are brave enough to try. I mean, you can never learn without trying and failing miserably, right?" And then I felt a bit better for being an idiot.  Ok, I went off on a tangent. After waking up, my sister, the most productive little daemon on earth decided that early morning is the right time to watch the movie "In America". I, being tied down to the room with the TV in it, was forced to watch it and found it to be actually quite enjoyable but would have rather done something more useful like study for those SAT's which are on June 5th. Please pray for me >_  Alright, so I'm standing there, right, just brushing my teeth when my sister, J, decides that her hair can't wait and that she NEEDS the only mirror/sink in the house. I wouldn't have needed the mirror for brushing on most days and would have just gone to the kitchen sink but today was different. I needed the mirror because I was trying to popcorn kernels out of my gums and braces (very nice image, i know. Reeeaal appitizin'). So, pissed off, J decides to punch my shoulder-blade with the tip of her index and middle fingers. She called it poking, but really, a poke doesn't hurt for 2 minutes after. Anyway, I punched her back on the outside of her shoulder and then, resenting it, punched my back, but this time on the top of my back so that my head jerked forward pushing the plastic part of the toothbrush into my gum. One word, Ow. So I punched her back and then she punched me back harder so I punched her back harder. She just kept getting angrier and angier that I kept hitting her back and then all of a sudden she unleashed the knees and shins and toes of fury of my shins, upper thiegh, chest, and almost that special place >_  After that whole exchange, I asked for money and left to work. At work, I masked and ate. While out eating I met this dude. He was a cool dude, a guitar playing dude who wrote songs and played them in Westwood Village. So I gave him a couple bucks and asked him to play a song and then I found out where he was playing and I hope to see him there. Then I went back to work and masked some more. After that I went to silly Kaplan for my silly SAT course. After that I caught a bus home and watched some TV, talked to Peter, ate some stuff, and started writing this post.  In conclusion, most of this post was boring. I'd say that the best parts were the first 2 paragraphs and the part about the fight with my sister, but that's just me. I probably just like it because I finally got to gripe about J :-). Thank you for reading a possibly semi-interesting reflection, and a almost certainly boring log... I guess that gives new meaning to Blog :-P.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      NOTE: The bitching and whining that is about to be mentioned isn't real bitching and whining. It's fake bitching and whining.  Squish, splat, sploot, boing, pitewie!  That's all I have to say for now... aside from the usual random bitching and whining.  Here's a sample: There's never any damn food ready around this freakin' place. I have to actually open a can of soup and HEAT IT UP!! Do you have any idea how stressful it is to have to worry about things like the dirty pan or what to do with the can once I've put the soup in the pan for heating? It's absurd what they expect me to do around here.  Also, what ever happened to respect of personal space? I mean, jeez, is it too much to ask for a 10 foot radius? Sure, I live in a 600 Sq. foot place, share it with three other people, and occupy ~12+% of the place with my furniture, books, and instruments, but shit! I need my desk cleared of EVERYONE ELSE'S CRAP... even though it's the only surface for putting things aside from the floor, kitchen or dining room tables (both of which are taken up by food and decorations. I'd put up a picture but I don't have a good digital camera.).  Further more, why is my stuff such a mess? Really, I should have a personal slave clean all this up FOR ME! Why when I work as much as I do on important problems like removing semi-useful features from Mac OS X.3.4 am I also required to clean up after myself? I swear to god other people can NOT have to deal with this! It's just rediculous.  I'm 16, I'm important and I deserve everything good that comes my way and think that everything bad is just an unjust authoritarian figure out to get me.  Ok, that was a joke. All of that was a joke. I don't think that any of what was just said is reasonable. To be honest, I'm actually feeling pretty good. Today was not as productive as I would have liked, but only I am to blame for I was the one who decided to spend most of it trying to take out ME 262's relentless drive to make sure Finder is always running (even after I killed Finder).  Well, I guess now's a good a time as any to study for those damn SAT's. I hate the College Board for everything it does, and that's not because I can't ace this piece of shit. It's that I don't feel I should have to to make my case to MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cal-Tech, and Berkeley.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      I came to a serious conclusion today, fish don't eat cheese. Also, cheese makes the fishbowl really yucky after a while.  I'm not feeling too hot right now because of a certain something called "giving the machine that I've been using that isn't really mine, but rather my dad's work's machine, which is much nicer than the machine i'll be going back to soon" syndrome. It's a real bummer for a number of reasons. One is the performance. I'll actually have to wait a whole few seconds for Safari to open a new window... It'll take longer than 10 seconds for Fireworks to come up... Mail will take a bit longer to check... Ya know, things like that. Then there's the part about HD space. I've gotten so used to 160GB. I'll have to go back to a lame old 135GB. I know, I know, it's not much to complain about, but when you think about how 115 of it's taken by default by other people's backed up data, it is a major hit. Thirdly, screen real estate. I also got used to 15 inches of places to put stuff. It'll be hard to go back to 1024 x 768 :-(. A lot of it's also sentimental. I have a tendency to get really attached to my machines. I still have my old Tangerine iBook, Tangerine iMac, 600Mhz iBook (that's the one I'll be going back to, if not the iMac), and first rev (5GB) iPod. I can never bring myself to sell my old technology. I'd be like selling a piece of myself, but not THAT much of myself. Probably just like ripping my index fingernail off (that's actually happened to me once) and selling it. That's how much it would hurt, but it would last like 8 months.  Anyway, this could be one of the last postings from ol' ME 262 as I like to call him. Farewell, old friend, farewell!         -- Feanor

      Yeah, I know. This post is like less than an hour after the previous one, but they're different topics. This one's about things I don't like to do or see.  1. I don't like lying but I feel ok to bend the truth if the question isn't direct. However, I hate being lied to, but only when I asked the question directly. At least I'm consistent. Also regarding lies, I don't like it when I point out to people that they're lying and then they stick do their guns. It just pisses me off.  2. People who misuse the word "Fuck." Guys, it's a precious word and contrary to what many of you might think, it can be over used, or even misused. Here's a good example of something I heard yesterday: I was walking down to the bus stop when I heard some lady with a heavy jewish accent yell at me "Look fuck where the ya goin'!" as I crossed the street Boston-style. First off, it's poor grammar to use it the way she did. Secondly, if you don't know what other words in english mean or how to use them, do you try and use them to sound cool or appealing or pissed off? I didn't think so. Stop misusing a perfectly fucking good word. Fuck.  3. Shitty drivers. Dude, if you don't know how to fuckin' drive, get off the damn road. I am sick of flying all over the fuckin' bus because of some fucking chink who's thinking about some random irrelevant shit that isn't the road. I don't even drive yet and I know that as soon as you get behind the wheel, you need to focus. God dammit!  4. People who give me queer looks. Firstly, what reason do YOU have to look at me funny? I am relatively presentable, stand with half-decent posture and my chin is right where it should be; not too high and not too low... Well, sometimes maybe a little too low, but that will soon be remedied. You on the other hand, often either drive a 50k+ car and think that you're better than me because you're a superficial assfuck, or you walk by in a shirt that costs more than the computer on which I'm typing this and reek of way too much cologne. Not that any of these random jerks would read this, but seriously, don't be so judgmental. Just because I try and keep what's in my backpack worth more than what's on my body, it doesn't mean I'm less than you. It just means that I have different priorities.  5. People who rant about shit that will never get fixed. Yep, that's me. I don't like a lot of what I do... but then again, who really likes everything about themselves? Here's my flaw. I try too hard and end up not caring in the end because the goal is either just too far or... I scare people away while I try and reach it.  Thanks for reading rants.         -- Feanor  P.S. There are more interesting blogs out there. Read 'em sometime.  P.P.S. God, send me a sign and show me how to interact with all the people I want to interact with!! Namely M- -a -ari- and J- -a -essic-

      NOTE: The title of this post has nothing to do with it's content... Aside from the fact that it's author likes toast... with a little bit of butter and maybe some jam or preserve or something.  I've got this thing about angels. Well, it's more of a thing with god, but whatever. Anyway, if god is all loving and all giving and infinite and bla bla bla and he created us (humans) for no other reason than to share his love with us, then why did he make angels? I was once told that the reason god creates anything is for only good purposes with no selfish motive. If that's the case, why are angels there? I mean, really, if you only make things to be free and choose whether or not to love you and only to share your love with them, why would you make something thats entire purpose is to serve and worship you.  Another thing, I've got this strange feeling that it's impossible for Lucifer to ever be forgiven of his deeds. My reasons for thinking about this issue is Lucifer should be feeling eternal suffering of the worst sort because he's the second most powerful thing in existence and has gone beyond the bounds of his definition (serving the number one dude (god)). Now we have a reason why Lucifer would want to be forgiven; he doesn't want to feel the worst suffering EVER! Now, here's why I think it's impossible for him to ever be forgiven: If he were ever forgiven, the entire purpose of christianity would be lost; all humanity would be in perfect communion with god by default and there would be nothing to draw them away from the head hancho's "love".  That in itself, to me, is a contradiction of the logic that god is "all loving and caring and forgiving and bla bla bla" because if he were all those great things, why wouldn't he have forgiven ol' Lucy by now? I mean, really, if you had a son who was constantly killing himself just to spite you, but was also asking you to take him back into your house of ultimate love, would you turn away and tell the rest of the family "oh, he's just pure evil. once upon a time he thought he was better than me and I just can't live with the thought of letting him back into my house EVEN THOUGH he feels eternal suffering because of the way I created him. I dunno, it just... it just doesn't feel right." I didn't think you would.  So, with that said, God is not infinite love and therefore God is not infinite and therefore God can be defined as a useful construct created by human perception (which is finite) to help manage their (and others) lifestyles and understand the mysteries of the world around them.  This was not a complete analysis by any means, but it's something to think about while you're on the bus :-).         -- Feanor  P.S.

      Yeah, i know, it's been a while since I've posted on this piece of shit. I'm not gonna obligate myself to following any of the rules that I initially set out for myself in this posting. I'm gonna make it as fast and painless as possible. Here's what's been happening:  I am one sexy bitch, as usual. I've been listening to a lot of Modest Mouse and it's been effecting how I play guitar. I like a girl by the name of Maria Krestyn and I have little to no idea of whether or not she can stand me. She smiles at me though and when she does I was to strangle myself because I never know what to do. But how is that different from it has always been? Born an socially-inept geek, always an socially-inept geek. Peter and Megan totally like each other and wouldn't it be great to see 'em together? (YES!)... That's what I thought. I'm becoming a hardcore catholic in the name of Maria and Peter and Megan and all the other fine souls at St. Thomas Aquinas College. No, I'm not going there for college. I eat more than usual. I just got a sidekick and have been IM'ing the crap out of all my friends with it. I got a blister on my second toe on my right foot.  That's about it. Peace out.         -- Feanor

      After reading through some of my old posts, I noticed something. All of my footnotes are more notes to self and things that I meant to put in parenthesis or after a semicolon than anything useful to the reader. I'd fix them now so that they'd mean something, but that wouldn't be as amusing to me. In conclusion, just for the records, it's not that I don't know how to use footnotes. I choose not to use them properly, ya see? I've got a feeling this will get old very soon though so I'll just use them properly from now on.  Anyway, time for something funny, and since I'm too lazy to look all over the place for funny and satirical stuff, I'll just put the address to a funny site.  urlLink The Onion  I'd list my favorite articles, but I think that this week's whole thing is funny.

      Here's another guess the song for everyone's time-wasting pleasure :-). Ya know, I've been thinking lately (pretty much for the past 20 minutes) why I like doing these things and I think I know what it is. I think I like doing these things because it makes me think that people care that I'm doing something like learn how to play guitar, or even that I'm doing anything. I guess it also helps reinforce my delusion that I'm getting decent. Well, whatever the reason, I like doing these so regardless of what you people want, I'm doing more. It's my blog after all and if you don't like listening to them, just don't click the link. It's not like anyone's forcing you.    urlLink

      Today, as I was playing some really hot lixx (because you know I'm just such a guitar master) my high E string had the audacity of breaking. The string whipped around, hit my left arm, and left a nice thin red curved mark from my wrist halfway to my elbow. I guess what bothers me isn't so much that the string broke or that a part of my arm stings like hell though, but that now I have to go out and buy new strings. This is like the third set of strings I've gone through in a month and a half. It's ridiculous. And on top of that, I'm probably not gonna be able to get a ride to Guitar Center for like a week. Sigh.  Anyway, enough of my whining. Check this out (Pete sent it to me):  urlLink The American People Ruled Unfit to Govern   That is all.         -- Feanor

      Ok, so I was sitting here in my room fiddling around with the guitar when it hit me, why not make a post of you playing a song that everyone can guess what it is? Then I thought, whenever I play my guitar over the phone to Peter to see what he thinks, he says it adds distortion so it might not sound very nice... But then I figured, if I told them that it doesn't have that crisp sound, would it be so bad? So here I am with a post of me playing a piece of a song that I'd like everyone to take a guess at what it is (Do it in the comments). Oh, and also lemme know whether I should do this again.  NOTE: I already know I am not a very good guitarist so there's no need to rub it in that I should be switching between chords faster and more cleanly. I know that already and that's why I practice.    urlLink

      Well, it being 4AM and I having nothing to do aside from listen to music through my headphones, read the news (which depresses me deeply), or blog about nothing, I think I'll post something nice.  This is about a friend of mine that I met while looking for Modest Mouse fans on blogger. She's really funny, got a head on her shoulders, a cool person to talk to, and most importantly for most of you, taking after it's author, her blog is really cool*. Perhaps a little too cool for her own good o.O. Her name is Christina and a link to her blog is here:  urlLink  Orange Ink    Seriously, if you're not gonna check it out, you better have something better to do than just go look at someone else's blog (even the rest mine)... Like paint a picture... of a guy... with a big knife... or playing some hot lixx like "meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedleeeeeyy" or something productive like checking out  urlLink  Strong Bad E-Mails   But even if you do these other great things like paint, play guitar, or watch e-mails, I think you really should check out her blog on top of it all :-).

      I love the Death Cab for Cutie   Forbidden Love - EP   I bought yesterday. I've been playing it over and over and I can't figure out exactly what's so appealing about it. It's probably his voice, but *shrugs*.  I love the semicolon; it's cool, isn't it?  I am much too distracted. Period.  New paragraph. New sentence. I went to work today and got some stuff done; less than I would have liked, but you know, you can't have it all. You can't just go to work for 7 hours, goof off for 3 of 'em and expect to get 5 hours out. Well, actually where I work, you can. You just have to arrange the goofing off properly. Between every mask, there's a period from about 3 to 30 minutes or more that you have to spend waiting for the computer to do some calculations with the data you manipulated and generate new file based on it, upon which you work and proceed to the next stage until you have 3D models of each hemisphere. It's so cool and exciting. I feel sexy*.  Moving on, after work my mom and sister (younger) picked me up (no car and no money for bus fare) and dragged me to the Laundromat. It was kind of surreal. I had been to the laundromat before, but it felt different this time. This time it felt like I was in a movie or a cheesy television show. Ya know, the ones where like the more-likely-than-not normal dude's just sitting there with a magazine, maybe some headphones waiting for his load to be done and this hot lady walks by and she looks at him all sexily and you know where it goes from there**...  Anyway, no hot ladies walked by and I just sat there wearing my usual outfit of a soccer jersey and gap relaxed fit light blue jeans (I'd put a picture up, but my camera's being retarded***) with big ol' dorky looking (They're ugly, but they sound damn good)  urlLink Bose Triport  headphones bobbing my head to the beat of The Get Up Kids and Death Cab For Cutie. The whole thing felt very odd.  Oops, I left something out. We went to get something to eat before we went to do the laundry. I work at UCLA, as you know, which as you may not know is in Westwood. In Westwood, there is an  urlLink In-N-Out **** and my sister wanted to get something to eat there. Knowing our family's tight financial situation and the incompetence in "doing the math", I recommended we order strategically at  urlLink Jack-In-The-Box , but Noooo! Ol' Javaneh***** is too good for Jacky and decides that she HAS to have In-N-Out so we stop there and spend like 7 bucks feeding 1 person; that's just way too much for fast food! With 8 dollars, you can feed 3 people comfortably at Jack's if you order properly. Anyway, my mom and I decided not to order anything and hold out until we saw something more reasonable.  On our way to the laundromat, we passed a Pizza Hut and I spotted a deal that said 6 bucks for a large pizza on Mondays. So, it being Monday, we stopped and got a large mushroom pizza from which we all took at least two slices. Now,  that's  what I call strategic eating. Ya see, all you have to do is draw out a game plan before you order and you end up with A LOT less waste. I am good. Being cheap is unattractive, I know. And Pizza Hut isn't the healthiest thing around, I know. And we could have just eaten something healthier at home for a fraction of the cost, I know. But try and get two whiney women on their periods who haven't eaten all day to wait 2+ hours for food. Bad move.  Anyway, I think that just about covers it. Sigh. I'm probably boring everyone who reads these things. I don't think that most people are as charmed by the everyday things that happen in one's life as I am. And I also bet that what everyone's been saying for the past four years is true (they all say I'm gay), but there's one problem with that. I've only had girlfriends and I don't get into men. With friends and family like this, who needs assholes and bitches?  Whoa, I just reread the post before I published it and it's not entirely coherent. Thanks for reading this far (and if you skipped to the bottom of the post then shame on you! Go read the rest! :-P). Oh, and I'm actually not cheap, I've always managed my personal funds such that I have a large balance after a while that I spend on something big. I just try to reduce waste when possible. Take that how you like, but I   know   that I'm not cheap.  That is all. -- Feanor  * This is not your standard issue sexy.

      Lately, I've been going though all the great DVD's that I've bought over the course of the past couple years and watching them when I can. I've only bought like 40 DVDs because I've been kinda selective of the movies that I buy. Mostly due to my lack of funds. I felt inspired half-way through The Untouchables to share the list of my favorites with everyone.  Anyway, here's the list of my personal favorites of the ones I own (in no particular order): The Untouchables Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction Arlington Road The Big Lebowski Monty Python and the Holy Grail The Nightmare Before Christmas Fists of Fury For a Few Dollars More A Fistful of Dollars The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly The Boondock Saints The Apostle The Wall 2001: A Space Odyssey Don Jaun De Marco Big Fish Grease Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Princess Bride  Here's a list of the movies that I love to watch for the hell of it (sub-great movies included too): Dude, Where's My Car? Animal House Kung Pow! Wayne's World Wayne's World 2 Airplane! (I'd add Airplane 2, but I don't own it) Top Secret! Super Troopers Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy Dogma Clerks: Uncensored Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Shrek Zoolander Clueless  Okay, okay, I admit it. So I love almost every movie I've bought >_  Ok, this was pointless. Well, not entirely; everyone knows a bit about my taste in movies now. I guess my work here is done.

      There seems to be a lot of confusion about how to pronounce my name. It's pronounced Feh-ah-nor or even Fey-uh-nor. Here's what it's not: Feener, Feeaner Fayner, Fee-ya-nor, or foogle-google. None of those.  It's not my birthname, but the reason that it's the name I use for everything is: He was the character in The Silmarillion that stood out to me most. This may sound cheesy, but I think that, in a way, he represents what's in all of us as human beings (even though he was an Elf).  If you want to find out more about him, check out this page:  urlLink http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/f/feanor.html   Or you can read the Silmarillion.

      This is not new. It is a post from Unpasteurized made on the morning of June 24.  Man, I'd be so lost. I guess I'd just do nice things for people, like teleport some pigeon turd that's about to land on a nice person's car to some dicksniffer's scalp. I might save some souls, possibly freak people out with voices in their heads. Throw a giant knife with a blade the size of the longest side of nebraska into the astrology council's main headquarters. I'd probably kill some evil fuckers too, but I would make it an easy death, ya know, something more painless than painful. All in all, while I think I'd be a nice god who would do a better job than the one we have in power now, I'd hate his job. It's kinda like the presidency of the United States; we could all do a better job than Ol' Dubya, but would any of us really want to spend 4 years in that shithole? I didn't think so.   ...

      This is not new. It is a post from Unpasteurized made on the morning of the 25th.  I have come to the conclusion that soap, deep penetrating thingies, foams, exfoliators, astringents, and facial scrubs are only capable of going so far in terms of clearing up my acne. My theory is for me to really combat this problem I'd need to make a life-style change and we all know how I hate those. Now, as I've said before, I'm no chemist or biologist, but I think that my diet of ho-ho's, sugar'd popcorn, ramen, and shrek candies are my worst enemies at the moment. There are also reports of high Dorito and Lay's Stax consumption that may also be contributing to the problem. Well, instead of a real change in my lifestyle that would fix the problem, I think I'll just do the american thing and just settle with declaring war on it.   We, the people of Unpasteurized, declare an all out war on Acne!! We won't stop until every pimple is destroyed!   ... but we won't  actually  do anything about it.

      This is not new. It is a post from Unpasteurized made on the night June 25.  Here's my position on AIM Away Messages: I don't have one...  But I prefer the ones that have something funny in them. I don't really care where you went, just as long as I know you'll come back eventually. One thing though, people who put suicidal notes in their away message piss me off. Oh, or these people who think that it's acceptable to put a very personal message in a very public place like "I hate you, Griff! You're a fucking dirtbag and you should go to hell and bla bla bla PMS shit!" Or these people who make inside jokes in their away messages also get on my nerves. You check someone's info and you see "R U   GoNNa eAt ThE bUNnY? !? LOL.

It's also not technically proper to use more than one punctuation at the end of a sentence. Also, What is up with these people who mix the caps? Not only do you waste time mixing them, you're making my life harder because I can't even read the sh -- shhhtufff (yeah, stuff) when it's like that. Sigh.

      Ok, this post is pointless, but some might consider it funny. In fact, it probably belongs on Unpasteurized, but I'm not sure so it goes here. Come to think of it, I think I'll move (probably just copy) the Acne and AIM Away Messages posts to this blog. Anyway, moving onto the post...  I was just taking a shower an half-hour ago or so and was reminded of an irrelevant rant I meant to make a while ago about the plumbing of the apartment complex in which I live. It seems that all the hot and cold water pipes are linked together or something because whenever someone in THE WHOLE BUILDING (it's just like 20 apartments, but still) flushes a toilet, turns on the shower, or even does so much as use the sinks, there's either a HUGE spike in temperature that results in the occasional burn and almost guaranteed high volume, high pitched scream of agony or there's a huge drop in temperature that usually results in a loud, low-toned grunt.  Speaking of extremely uncomfortable hot water, in this last shower, I experienced pain that I didn't know could be felt by only hot water. The shower that I use has the water come out at an ungodly high pressure. I mean, the pressure is so high that if you have a pimple on your forehead and you put your face under the water and the main stream of water hits it, it hurts as if you smashed your head against a wall or table. Anyway, I was taking my shower and the water temperature spiked and I happened to be turning in such a way (I think I was getting the body wash) that the stream was aimed at that special place. There is no word to better describe the pain felt than a monotonically said "Ouch*." I'd say it hurts worse than spilling hot coffee on yourself.  I think I've gone into more than enough detail, but here's the point: If you're a guy, learn how to avoid this situation and situations like this. If you're a girl and are considering doing some kind of practical joke on your ex or plan on ending your current relationship, setting him up with hot liquids is just not the way to do it. It's cruel and unusual punishment.  What did I tell ya? Pretty pointless and irrelevant, eh?  That is all. -- Feanor  * Followed by screams, shouts, some expletives, and the victim waving his arms around ridiculously trying to get it off.

      This hasn't exactly been a great week for sleep. I've been averaging less than 6 hours a night. For some reason, I can't fall asleep before 3AM and even when I do, my sleep is disturbed by a phone call, a bad dream, my mom or sister, or bright morning light that shines onto my face through the blinds of (THE) bedroom window*. As a result, I am constantly tired, groggy, and slightly irritable. What makes this even odder is that I haven't taken any stimulants for over a month. Sigh.  On a happier note, since I think my past posts have mostly ended up negative notes, I think this one should be different. Work is becoming fun again. I bring my iPod, turn up the tunes, and just mask the day away. It's also nice how it's summer because the machine on which I work in an old disabled freezer that gets really hot when the light's left on so I usually end up sitting in the glow of the monitor. The room's about 9 feet by 5 feet with no windows (what kinda freezer do you know has windows?) and when I leave for the day at around 5 or 6, the sun is still out. It's nice for me to feel like the day hasn't been completely spent yet.  Anyway, I should probably get to doing what I have to do**.  That is all.         -- Feanor  * My mother, sister, and I share a one bedroom apartment that can't possibly be bigger than 500 sq. feet.  ** Neuro-imaging, building-websites, math, prep for the SATs in autumn, physics, and chemistry (prioritized first to last from most important to least important).

      This is the summary of the long 3000-ish word post below.  My parents fucked up my education and I have a lot to get done now in a very short period of time because of them. Is it really their fault for not giving me the proper resources such as time, books, learning aids, a half-stable house for eight years, or was it just my lack of creativity? I certainly can't say anything about the opportunities that they've provided. Those, admittedly have been amazing, but what good are opportunities if the resources to take advantage of them? I'm probably just passing the buck.  That is all.         -- Feanor.

      Alright, I can't take it anymore! I have to say this out loud. My parents have fucked up big time over the majority of the past 7 years of home schooling me. The only two good things that "they" did for me was done by my dad (who, trust me on this, fucked in many other areas to balance it out to the far negative). He put me in Harvard Extension classes in which I had the best time I've ever had and he took me to work with him on a regular basis where I got to work on cool electrical engineering problems and interact with some of the greatest up and coming minds. I thank him profusely for that and my appreciation is undying for the good things that he's done. But shit, man, there is too much that just WASN'T FUCKING DONE for my education.  Let me introduce you to my family during the turn of the millennium. My father, after getting his Ph.D in elementary particle physics at UCLA decided that it would be a good idea to move to Boston* and get yet another degree, but this time from the most prestigious technical university in the world, MIT. This was a great move for me in a lot of ways. I got to see Boston, the place that I consider to be my true home. I also got to hang around MIT and, as I've said, chat with great minds. It inspired me to be great, but here's where a great plan goes sour.  My dad had already accumulated a lot of debt from being a student and having to support a family for 10 years so we couldn't afford much of anything other than the bare essentials. Even when discussion for supplies such as textbooks came up, it was actually debated as to whether it was worth the money even if we could afford it. Now, I don't mean to knock my mom too much, but I'm just trying to state facts here. My mom has always had what she called a "pragmatic" mentality so whenever such a discussion would come up, the first thing that came to mind was not the possible payback of investments in our (my sisters and my) education, but rather the financial burden of it. Whether that attitude was entirely a bad thing for me is kinda debatable, but it led to MANY extremely unproductive days where I would surf the net looking for things like sports stats, game strategeries, and funny pictures. At least I learned how to use google like a master :-\.  Anyway, my parents also didn't clean up the legal issues of us being home schooled so my sister and I have been both   technically   playing hooky for the past 8 years, which is a bit of a problem because if either of us want to go back to a public school, we can't really because my parents could be charged with what's-it-called (essentially being reckless with your kids and not being responsible and bla bla bla). It's not like either of us want to go back to school, but still, having the option open is nice.  Well, after my dad got promoted through a very confusing set of hoops from graduate student to research scientist**, things were starting to look up. We had to move out of our old apartment because he wasn't a student, so the cost of rent went WAY up, but it was ok because he got a big fat raise. I got my first personal computer that year. It was an Apple 300Mhz Tangerine iBook. I used it for things like logo, starlogo, java coding, web surfing, and gaming (only old games, though. It wasn't exactly top notch graphics-wise).  I also got my first math textbooks in 3 years that year. My dad had been looking but wasn't satisfied with what was out there until he found a publishing company called Key Curriculum Press. He bought the first two years of the Integrated Math Program (IMP). I had a tough time with them, but was always hesitant to ask for his help because for one, he'd get mad at my inability to figure it out faster than I was and would hit me in the head (sometimes he'd to more than that too (I've got enough stories to fill a book (and not a small one), lemme tell ya) (that's really helpful for learning, ya know)), and because he'd always pat himself on the back for finally finding a book that was good enough for me. So after a while of hating math just because of my father's immaturity, I got over it and started again when I was 14.  This time instead of asking my dad for help though, I'd use the internet and I'd ask the MIT undergrads for help with my Algebra I and Geometry problems. Once I knew my resources and had them set up, I was breezing through my books and ended up doing over 3 years of math in a couple months. That was a big and much-needed boost for my ego. After I finished all of my math books, I moved on to reading every book that was on the shelves in my house that had more words that I could understand than words that I didn't. Mind you, we had a lot of bookshelves that were pretty full of big books. I finished that self-assigned task before the start of the summer***.  After that I had little left to do academically in terms of what I had resources for so I started playing soccer and computer games. I went to Brigg's Field (The massive field at MIT where one can join any number of pick-up games between April and October) everyday for 5 hours and played the entire time. When I wasn't at the field, I was either outside practicing my skills or inside playing StarCraft. This was the summer before the attacks of september 11th.  Somehow I managed to slip into laziness and didn't do an ounce of productive work for an entire year and a half. As much it may be my fault for not finding something to do, I didn't have a whole lot to do so I continued to play soccer and computer games all day.  When the following winter**** ended, my dad set my up for a couple Harvard Extension classes of my choice. I chose An Introduction to Digital Logic Physics-123b and The Language, History and Culture of Indo-Europeans (I forget the exact names, but I think those are pretty close. I got a B- in the Linguistics class and a C+ in my Electronics class, but I left a bigger (positive) impression on my teachers than those grades would lead most to believe. During that semester, my dad bought the 3rd book of IMP (but not the 4th for some reason unknown to me) and I didn't touch the thing until December 2003. I guess that really is my fault though; it was sitting around for quite a while, but remembering the struggles I went through to go through the first two books, I certainly wasn't looking forward to this one.  Summer (2003) passed again without any work getting done, except this time there wasn't any soccer either because MIT kicked all the soccer players off the field for tearing the field up with their cleats. I got really mad when they kicked us off because it's a goddamn field; that's what it's there for. Autumn came and I was enrolled again in Harvard Extension classes. This time I chose American Political Thought and Introductory German. I had a really hard time with a rally bad teacher and decided to drop it. It wasn't just me though, a bunch of people dropped the course for that reason. I managed to get a solid B in my hardcore government course. That professor may quite possibly the best I ever learn from. I felt particularly proud of myself that semester because I got an A- on my first of two papers (my second was like a B or B- :-\). I also learned a valuable lesson: Study for finals. They'll kick you in the ass if you don't.  My mom moved out from the apartment to Los Angeles in like September or October of 2003 (I don't remember that date too well) to pursue some kinda ridiculous acting career with my little sister. Over half of my family is fucking retarded, I know. They make me want to vomit sometimes with the things they say, think, and do. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm no perfect person, but I think I'm doing pretty well for the shit that's been dealt. Anyway, they moved out and I had a lot of responsibility put on me all at once. I now had to do all the laundry, all the cooking, all the cleaning, and all the shopping, on top of my already full-ish academic plate. Thanks, mom.  So time went by and my relationship with Shannon (9 months at the time) began to wear thin so, along with the number of opportunities that my uncles had set up for me at UCLA, I decided to move to California in January of 2004 to help keep the relationship going. Whenever I think about it, I miss her. I am so stupid; not for missing her, but for doing all the things I did that she just didn't deserve. Ok, I should change the subject before I bury myself with a feeling of regret and feel the desire to kill myself.  Moving on, I was now in LA and things were starting to pick up again. I picked up my math book again and was going through it (slowly... very slowly). I also set myself up for volunteer positions at UCLA hospital as a Patient Escort and did that until my other two heavier-duty volunteer positions (research and personal work for professors) fell into place. They eventually did and I worked really hard on both of them. It looks like I'll be getting two recommendation letters and my name as an author on a neuro-science paper (in a very new, unexplored, and exciting part, I might add).  My mom had found and got a job at the Beverly Wilshire hotel (with a great deal of help from my uncle's girlfriend) and had been working there for a couple months but got fired before her three month probation period was up. My mom was unemployed for a while, but started to find things to do around the house and on the internet. Even though she was home a lot of the time, she's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and therefore couldn't help me on my math except listen to my rants about how much I hate it.  We now go back to April/May 2004. My mom had been talking to this guy who she thought was kind of attractive and wanted to divorce my dad because he was "too angry" for her and "she just couldn't take all the negative energies anymore". I'll tell you right now, I'm one of the first people to bash and make stabs at my dad, but there are a couple things that he isn't. One is "full of negative energies" and the other is "an angry guy". If he ever gets angry, it's provoked and he's got some tolerance before he blows. He even lets you know before he's about to get pissed off; he'll tell you flat out "you're really pushing my buttons, I'd watch it." But no, my mom just ignores all the signs and keeps pushing him until he blows up and yells loud enough for the world to hear (you thought that was thunder? Giggles.).  Anyway, my mom's reasons were all crocks of shit because they've been together for over 17 years of bad-ass crap (most of which I've seen first hand). It was all worse than all the examples that she could site during any fight that they had about this guy. To make matters worse, she tried to hide this guy's existence from me while letting my sister know full well. The women in my family are both rotten liars and have no problem keeping a secret if it means that they will get what   they   want  when   they   want it. Feel free to IM me if you're curious about the history of my mom's marital fidelity (it's not spotless) -.-.  Now, you might wonder what this all has to do with my academics, and here's the answer: My SATs as some of you may remember were in June. I was taking a Kaplan course in May to help get my score up (it worked really well, by the way; definitely worth the money.) and I just couldn't study. "Why not go to a deli or a diner or something and study?" some might ask, here's the answer: I live in a very protective household, no matter how fucked up so I couldn't really leave. If I left they called my cell phone incessantly. If I didn't pick it up or turn it off, I would have gotten an endless speech and some yelling about how not to leave the house by myself after dark. Point is I was fucked because I didn't have anywhere to go and study and home was a battlefield because of my mom's need to fuck someone other than my dad and my dad's inability to handle the problem effectively.  So here I am now, still on year three of my math curriculum, applying to colleges in the fall with 3 letters of recommendation, a long resume of extracurriculars, no working knowledge of chemistry or physics, AP Biology, and some work experience. I wonder how I'll get everything I need before November knowing my family of self-consumed pricks.  Then again, I guess my lack of progress during the years of limited resources isn't really their fault, but mine rather for not being creative. I'm just passing the buck, aren't I?  That is all.         -- Feanor  * We arrived on the cold, foggy morning of August 9th, 1997. I was 9 years old.

      I don't like it very much, but I have to do it. That last sentence wasn't entirely accurate. I don't like doing math for the hell or "beauty" of it. God seems to have given me the gift of being able to do it with speed and accuracy but I don't really take to it. I don't mind doing it if it's helping me solve some more interesting, tangible problem that I'm working on at the time, but just doing it for kicks seems stupid. Then again, I'm only just now getting to calculus so it might get better and more interesting as I get more advanced. We will see. Until then, I do what I must to get into the colleges of my choice. Today will be a long day*. At least it's not too slow... But then again, it's not very fun either.  That is all.         -- Feanor  *  8+ hours of math.

      It was pointed out to me recently that I'm screwed any way I go in terms of fads. Supposedly anything can be called a fad so my being upset about fads falling on me is just a fad and will pass. But that would mean that I am an actual fad-follower. But if I ignore the fads and act like they're not there, then I'm screwed too because that   could   also be considered fad-like behavior. I could also just not mind being called a fad-follower, or being misunderstood, but that's not me. It seems that the only option for people who don't want to be associated with fads or their followers is to just join the crowd of mindless, culture-less, and uncreative zombies that follow what their parents and peers tell them to and to not be bothered by being apart of the group. I am now very sad. I am sure it will pass within the half-hour though.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      Peter is funny. I found out recently that he didn't know the phrase "steal your digits" and misused it. Supposedly, he heard it in a Modest Mouse song called Lounge (Closing Time) and thought it meant "cut off your fingers". With that in mind, when he got mad at this girl named Cecilia* and said "I want to steal your digits" in an angry tone. I wonder what she thought he meant. Knowing that group of people, they probably laugh at, or at least talk about him behind his back. Poor guy.  I just thought this story was hilarious and wanted to share it.  That is all.         -- Feanor  * There's a bit of a history with him and Cecilia. They were in this Fiddler On The Roof play together and she would always laugh at him while he would say his lines. She also purposely tried to screw him up and distract him when it was obviously pissing him off. Now, some people might think "oh, she likes him, but is just immature" but we doubt that because she's like 15 or around that area and she's not a socially inept bloke like myself. She's probably just mean.

      I have really gotta get cracking on that website I was gonna build with my cousin, Peter. It's a website that will extremely detailed tabs, audio clips, video clips, some technique, and some exercises to help the learning guitarists. It started as being just a reference for my cousin and me after we became so fed up with people who write and post extremely poor quality, and even inaccurate tabs. Then we thought of making it a service and maybe even a learning reference for everyone, but we'll see. Neither of us are expert guitar players, but until we become considerably better, I definitely want to put together the tabs of extremely high detail and get 'em up on a site for all to see.  It probably wont realize itself until like August though and even then it'll probably only have modest mouse, the get up kids, and they might be giants tabs :-(. The thing is that for anything to get our seal of approval, it has to be so detailed that no one has the patience to do it. If you think you have the patience to tab out all the guitars of an entire song accurately (close enough doesn't count) then please leave a comment, or better yet e-mail me at thelordmeowmix@gmail.com Help is always welcome :-).  That is all.         -- Feanor

      Last night, there was this guy I met in Westwood who played guitar and was doing a show at a bar and grill. I have him like 3 bucks and said that I'd be at his show, but the thing is that I never got to go. I really wanted to go, but my mom was "oh her feet all day long and it was just so exhausting" and I can understand that. She's 39 years old so that might be a little difficult and she's my mom so she deserves a break every now and again. Besides, it's not really her job to drive me around from place to place.  That was a bit disappointing for me because he seemed like a nice guy and he seemed to be looking forward to me meeting him there, but ya know... Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you. What's that even mean anyway? It doesn't matter. I guess the number 4 thing I need now is a way to get around the city. Back in Boston, I could walk everywhere and while there was the bus and train, I didn't really NEED to take it. But in Los Angeles, it's a whole different ball-game because I'm like 6 miles from work and there are some big fat hills that are right in the way.  Since our money's a little more than "a little tight", I can't exactly be asking for my own car. But even if I had one, I'd have to go back to Massachusetts to get a full license that I would then have to turn into a California license because of a bunch of stupid California laws aimed at making the roads "safer". I personally think it's just a way for the state to charge more processing fees than ever before, but that's just me. Anyway, aside from all the trouble and a stupid class I'd have to take, I'd have to pay a bunch of fees to both states and take a total of 4 driving/road related exams. Assuming that was taken care of though, there's no car for me to drive. We're leasing a Volkwagen Jetta and that's the only car we have. So if I were to drive, I'd need to not only buy a new car, but also pay absurdly high insurance on the car because I'm under 18. The whole situation is stupid so I'm just waiting until I'm 18 so that I can avoid most of this logistical mess.  Then there's the option of the bus pass. This one seems to work really well for my needs because I don't usually need to get around anywhere farther than a mile or two after 2AM or before 6AM and there's a bus that takes me a block away from work. I actually don't know why my parents don't get me a bus pass. For only 50-something dollars a month, I could be out of their hair ride-wise and I'd be a little more independent. I'd start to pay for the pass in a month or so because I'll be getting a job with my uncle at his Car Rental place doing things like clean, park, move, and install parts into the cars.  Hopefully that job will allow me the financial freedom to eat more than ramen and popcorn everyday. It's amazing how much two 5's, a 1, and some pocket change can get you at Ralph's and the Farmer's Market if you know how to use it. I think this poor diet business, while not effecting my weight much at all, is really getting to my internal stuff because I feel groggier and even less healthy than I usually do. I know you probably wouldn't believe this, but I used to be a star athlete. I totally raped at soccer and could run for over 4 hours straight. It feels good to look back on those days sometimes, but it makes me sad in a way, so I'll stop.  Moving on to a completely unrelated topic, I called my orthodontist this morning they said that the earliest appointment they can give me is on the afternoon of July 16th to get my braces off (Hoorah! I hate these fargin' things!), which is a bummer because I fly out there on the 2nd of July which means that I'd have to stay in Boston for at least three weeks. Now that wouldn't normally be a problem, but I have that thing called a JOB that I need to be at and my taking month-long breaks this frequently is not good for my image! Sigh. At least I'll get to spend more time at a place I like :-).  I think I've run out of things to say at the moment, but it probably wont be long until I remember something else. If you've managed to read this far, I admire you. I would have probably just skimmed it and said to myself "too long, too boring, nothing funny. I hope his next post is funnier." If you want something funny to read, you might enjoy the "random crap that's on our mind" type blog that I set up with my cousin.  It's at  urlLink http://unpasteurized.blogspot.com/   That is all.         -- Feanor

      I am groggy and actually feel "tired" on top of it. Kinda funky. Anyway, I need to be at work in under an hour and it takes half an hour to get there with the bus, yet here I sit posting in something that no one will read instead of getting ready. I am a genius, I know.  I work at UCLA in the Neuro-Imaging department as a volunteer. You're probably thinking "Oh, he's just a volunteer who's taking his job WAY too seriously. I think I'll go laugh at him now." and you would have been right to laugh if I were just doing hours of Patient Escort at the hospital, but I might be getting a recommendation letter out of this, so it's important that I show up on time and consistently and bla bla bla. Laugh if you want; it's not like it really bothers me, but what are you laughing at? Meh, you might find this story kinda funny.  On Tuesday, I went into work armed with 5.25 hours of sleep. While I was working on a mask (explanation on what that is in footnote (no, not what Ann Coulter means by footnote)*) for one of the infant brains and forgot to bring my music with me. I use music to keep me up in times of exhaustion and focused in times of awakeness(?). Anyway, after spending 3 hours on something that should have taken 1.5 hours, I went off into a long reflection and fell asleep sitting up and with my eyes half-open (not normal for me. I usually collapse onto the nearest desk with my eyes shut). When I woke up, I noticed that 23 minutes disappeared and thought it very odd, but went on my "merry" way working. My boss, Rebecca, didn't see me sleeping or anything, which was good, and I could have kept it good if I wasn't stupid. When she asked how far along I was on the mask, I said "It's not done. I feel asleep half-way through." After taking the 1.342 second rule (I should really up that to 8 seconds for people who have a big effect on my future), I said it not realizing the ramifications. When I thought about it in those 1.342 seconds, it didn't sound nearly as stupid as when I uttered it and heard it back. As I said it, I thought "damn, this is a REALLY dumb thing to say and if there was a way to stop and change it, I would" but I was already saying "aslee" and at that point I knew I was screwed. Sigh some more.  Well, at least today I will bring my music, but my being stupid again will leave me with only 3 or so hours of music out of a 5 to 7 hour workday. I'd sigh again, but I'm too tired. I'll just say the word like I usually do. Sigh.  That is all... except the footnote.         -- Feanor  * Masking requires pretty much four key skills: using a keyboard, using a mouse, knowing how to get around UNIX relatively fluently, and knowing what you're looking at when you see an MRI. You essentially color in the brain of the MRI scans that get used for modeling, data analysis, and some other cool stuff.

      Ok, to be honest, while it took me until 4:30 to get to bed, I didn't try to get to sleep until like 2:45 because I was reading a certain person's 155 posts. Yes, I read each and every post. It's kinda hard to stop when you've already been reading 80, 90, 100, 120, and 135 posts because you keep thinking "well, I've made it this far, why stop? Besides, what she's writing is funny. Just 30 more minutes and then I'm definitely sleeping." That's how it goes for me anyway. Well, I'll tell you while that may have been a good idea on a Friday or Sunday night, it's a really bad idea when you need to be at work tomorrow because it means that your sleeping time is cut in half. Bad idea.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      It hit me last night while I was trying to get to bed -- errrmm... sleep, rather. I was lying in bed for over 2 hours trying all kinds of trick that usually work for getting me tired at 3:40. I even tried doing those relaxing anti-stress things, but just ended up exhausted and still unable to sleep.  Anyway, it hit me much, MUCH earlier this morning that while I may good at about everything I try (except dancing, any and everything that requires "grace" (except soccer), and being without my music collection), and while I may have been raised an engineer, I think I might want to be a political scientist or even a musician. I don't know how to read, write, or even play most music, but I just have so much fun when I learn how it works. It's got that cool "it's theory, but it's also tangible" factor, which is really appealing to me. Political Science seems cool to me though because I took this class at Harvard Extension on American Political Theory from 1600 to like 1890(? I forgot the exact dates, but it was pretty much from the colonies until woman's suffrage) and I think that it was the best class I've taken (well, I've only taken 4, but it was the most interesting reading I've done in a long (*stretched 'o' sound* I just feel stupid typing a bunch of o's and it's kinda ugly) time). So, I dunno what I'll do. I'll probably just float back to engineering of some sort because I've been around it for so much longer and feel more cozy with it. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  Oh, what ever will I do? Well, I guess we have until sophomore year of college to figure that out, don't we?  That is all.         -- Feanor

      I made a guest post on my cousin's blog upon his request. It can be found at  urlLink Andres Corner .  Speaking of my cousin, I have also started a new blog with him called Unpasteurized with random stuff that seems funny at the time of posting. A longer and more accurate, but still brief and incomplete description can be found there; there being:  urlLink Unpasteurized  . Just spend a minute or 8 skimming it, will ya?

      Somethings that have been vexing me highly lately are one, that the iPod doesn't count the number of times you play a song on it and add it to the play count of the iTunes library. Secondly, iTunes is being a jerk that really gets into crashing and taking the machine down with it. And thirdly, Audioscrobbler doesn't base it's data on your iTunes library; it bases it on how many times you play the songs while this specific plugin is running, which is a real bummer because I listen to a lot of music while I'm not on my computer, or running that little plugin. Sometimes it makes other applications sad for some reason, so I'm forced to quit it >_  My Get Up Kids count should be around 400 songs higher than it is on audioscrobbler. It should also have a real top 50 favorite artists, but it doesn't because, like I said just a moment ago, it doesn't base it on the iTunes library file.  Sigh. Mucho grande la bümmer (I know it doesn't make any sense, but I think it sounds funnier than "Much big of bümmer").  That is all.             -- Feanor.

      Upon taking a shower today, I discovered these new big bottles. It said something like 3 in 1 shower gel. Supposedly it does everything that other gels do, but in one bottle. It says that it can be used as a bubble bath, body wash, AND shampoo. Now, I'm no chemist, but I can't imagine why for all these years they'd use separate sets of chemicals for each job when they could have used one set for all the jobs. Well, ya know it is with that technology and stuff and how it goes so quickly. But even then, they still have different sets of chemicals for each job. There must be like 5 jillion shampoos and conditioners alone, not to mention the googolplexes of body washes and bubble baths that are on the market. At least the all-in-one things smell ok. They smell kinda like candy, jelly beans in particular. One's called "Coconut" and the other's called "Marine". The writing on the bottle's also kinda amusing, it's got some common phrases, but they stick the flavor of the all-in-one in place of a word. I forget how it goes, but a couple of the lines were "A Marine to end all Marines" and "The Coconut that ate the big apple".  I imagine it's been there for a couple days or a week... or so, which is about the time we went to Target. I usually find something new around the house after my mother and sister go there. It takes me a while to notice things in the shower though because I'm usually walking in more asleep than awake and most of the process happens with my eyes closed and me ready to fall over. Hehe, I imagine I look pretty funny in there; grabbing at the plastic bottles of shampoo, body wash, and facial cleansers like a blind man. Giggles. That is all.         -- Feanor

      Now, first off, I'm not a fad-follower. I don't like fad followers and I most certainly don't want to be thought of as a fad follower. Thinking about it though, that must be how I'm perceived. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I HAVE to be different from anyone or anything popular or else my world collapses. I just don't like looking like I follow the fads for reasons I'll explain in a bit. It just seems that whenever I change something about something that's been the same with me for a long while or if I happen to really like something that's new, it happens to be a fad that's just coming in. I know, it's frivolous to worry about such stupid things as this, and I don't worry about it. I'm just noticing and being bothered by it. Just a few examples of fads that I happen to fall in: My hair, my music, my machines, and my extra-curricular interests. Back in late 2002 / early 2003 everyone was either wearing their long hair or trying to grow their short hair. It was about this time that I decided that it might be a good time to try longer hair because I've had short hair all my life, but I didn't decide that now was the time because everyone else was doing it; I didn't even know that everyone else was doing it. How could I know about it? I'm a home-schooled, 93% socially unaware person who doesn't pay much more attention to fashion than a roach does the meaning of life. It wouldn't have been a real problem except that I got labeled as soon as I left the friggin' house to buy some juice or a sandwich or ride the bus to work as someone who's "followin' that hair fad". They wouldn't come and tell me straight out or anything, but you can tell when they look and interact with you differently. The other thing that reminds me of this constantly is my music taste. Again, it's not like I have to be listening to something that's totally different from what's popular to be "ok" in my mind. I just don't like people getting the wrong impression of me. An example of this is Modest Mouse. I was introduced to them a year and a month back by my late cousin, John Marie, but didn't take to it (Probably because he only played "Mice Eat Cheese" for me, as far as I can remember anyway). But when his brother played it for me again in early February, I liked them and started listening to them. Then Modest Mouse released their new album "Good News For People Who Love Bad News" which is kind of a hit now. I hear it being blared out of car windows every now and then and they've been getting some airtime on MTV and MTV2. I feel great for Isaac and the gang and they've been together for over ten years and really deserve their popularity and fame. Whether they're popular or not doesn't bother me; it's what people think my reasons are for liking them that bothers me. I don't change to follow fads, I just seem to land in them. I don't think I need to explain any further than I have because I think the main idea is pretty clear. But in case it's not:  In short, I hate being misread / misinterpreted / misunderstood / mis-anything and my uncanny ability to unintentionally stumble into fads doesn't help my cause. Sigh.  I know the contents of this post were frivolous and stupid in a lot of ways (one being "why should I care what people think in terms of something as meaningless as that?"), but I just wanted to type it out. It helps me think about this issue at hand and I usually end up not being bothered by what I was complaining / thinking / reflecting about. In this case, I'll probably forget about it and think "ah, fuck it" whenever someone mentions it. That is all.         -- Feanor

      Note to self that I will probably not see until it's too late: Be sure to look for a guitar teacher, practice guitar on Friday, finish up that stupid math book, and get 9 hours sleep in one go.

      ... I'd use it. But there isn't one.  Well, it's been like 6 days since my last post, which is, if not surprising to anyone else, is at least surprising to me because this week hasn't been terribly busy, which means that I have like no excuse for not writing anything. That last sentence was run-on, I know. I feel terrible about it.  Anyway, as usual, nothing's happened. Not even any epiphanies. This was quite possibly the most boring week of the past 3 months. I say three months because, for one I can't remember much further back than that, and I remember there being an extremely boring week right around that time where I didn't do anything except work, work, work on a boring project that ended up turning into nothing. I think it was right around that time that I had just finished one of my math textbooks, and whenever I finish one of those things, I take a week-long break and end up spending the time either playing guitar or StarCraft or something, something boring. Random thought of the moment: Halo is fun.  Random thought of the following moment: Smarties are really nasty after two years of being left out in an environment that isn't dry or cool. *choke* *cough* Try to avoid learning that the hard way.  Not that anyone would care about this particular bit of information, but I've had to go to the bathroom for the past 2 hours, but I've been debating whether or not to actually get up and walk the whole 20 feet to the bathroom because of a number of stupid things. One of the few stupid things is the music that's playing. iTunes happened to give me some really good songs in a long list with Shuffle and I haven't wanted to take off my headphones to get up because I would risk missing yet another good song on my list. Another reason is my e-mail. I was working on this one reply for 25 minutes and I worried that if I got up, it would ruin the flow of the message when I came back to finish it up. When I finally got it done and I thought I might have an excuse to get up, another message deserving of a long reply came! After spending 15 minutes replying to that one, I thought "alright, this is it. I finally have no reason to sit here anymore. I can finally go." as I lifted myself out of my chair... but then I heard the sound of doom. *Big drum pounds dramatically* An incoming IM from a certain someone who manages to always get on my nerves after 5 minutes of talking, but I still manage to leave unblocked on my buddy list. Plopping back into my chair, I respond as if nothing is wrong and I have no reason to leave the computer... ever. Acting on this stupidly given cue, she types and types and types, but she doesn't just type statements like she usually does. She asks questions this time. Lots of questions that need answers and fast. Now, this personality of mine is set up such that I can't just leave questions in open IM windows unanswered, so I spend the time to answer her questions. Now, this part's kinda amusing. I'd been holding it for so long that I'd forgotten that I had to go. Then I started this blog post and wasn't reminded that I had to go until I mentioned it. Now at like 2 hours and 20 minutes of having to go, I think I'll try and end this post with something interesting to think about.  I've been thinking about this one for a while and actually wrote a post explaining my thoughts at the time on the issue, but for those of you don't want to read back right now, the question goes something like this: If you believe that god is infinite along every dimension, which can be proven "logically", then why did he create angels? I'm too lazy and I've been holding it for too long to explain the whole background to the question so either read about St. Thomas Aquines or read my thoughts on the subject which contain a brief description of the whole story in my post "Toast" written in early May. That is all.         -- Feanor

      8 Days since my last post. This should be in the papers :-).  Moving on, I have two gmail accounts now. TheGermic@gmail.com and TheLordMeowMix@gmail.com. I also have one invite left for anyone who's interested and is pure of heart :-P. My cousin took the liberty of giving himself an account after noticing that I had three invites. I gave him the password to TheGermic a while ago because he wouldn't stop naggin' about it and he was just so excited to see it. I just couldn't resist.  Moving on again, I stayed for a long time at the Steven's place, which is most of the reason for my not posting. While I was there, a lot happened. I beat all of the GDI and NOD missions of Tiberian Dawn, yes, the one for Windows 95. I also beat all of the Allied missions and every Soviet mission except the last one. Oh, and I also got half-way through the Allied campaign of Red Alert 2. Ah, and we can't forget about getting through half of Halo on Legendary with Peter. We spent a lot of time gaming, but it's not like that's all we did. Peter spent most of the time sleeping and eating because I was taking his computer. Poor guy, I feel bad now for what I did. I swear not to do it again, and as all readers of this as my witness, bla bla bla... or something like that. I forget how the rest of those types of things go. Anyway, we also played guitar for a bit, tabbed some songs, played Gravity Rides Everything a million times looped, and ya know, the usual.  Speaking of which, we got two new controllers for my x-box. I used to have two of the older bigger ones, but then we needed two more so we could have a halo party type-a thing with people. It's kinda hard to have a party with only two people at a time playing :-\. When I first got the controllers, I didn't think I'd like the smallness because I was so used to the big ones for over 2 years, but I got used to it pretty quickly and I really like it now. Just feels a lot more comfortable.  Lauren's party is tomorrow and I want to go. I have to call her tomorrow morning/afternoon to make sure that 1) it's still happening 2) What time it is, and 3) Where it is. There is this slight problem though, my mom isn't sure she can give me a ride and my dad is worried about the milage of the car, but knowing my life situation, things will go through pretty well. My life is easy, nothing bad really happens, and anything that does is just my looking at the situation in the wrong way. Ya gotta look at everything positively, as I like to think to myself when things start looking rough. I usually end up forgetting the bad things and feeling really spoiled and getting kinda depressed. Not having friends to help keep things in perspective doesn't help either, but there's gotta be a reason I don't have friends in the greater scheme of things ;-) ... ... ... :'(. Anyway, I hope I can go because it sounds like oh-so-much-fun and I just really want to go.  I've been talking to Kat online more often now ever since her online time has increased. It's always nice to talk to her, she's always so nice and has something interesting to talk about, or is open to listen to whatever stupid thing I have to say. Sigh. I like her even though I've never met her in person and have never even seen a picture of her. But wouldn't that then say that I really just like her personality and nothing more? I guess it would. There are a lot of nice people in the world, but few really ring with me. I think she's one of those people who can be a friend for a while. Then again, I've only known her for like 2 or 3 weeks via AIM. History on Kat: Peter went to school with her in CO. She likes to act and dance and sing. She's got brown hair and blue eyes and white skin. She's really nice :-).  Anyway, I think I've said all I need to say. If I have more to say, I'll just throw it in another post, I guess... That is all.         -- Feanor

      It just doesn't have the same ring as Alabama, but whatever. I tried to give it a spiffy name :-\.  I feel homesick. Sometimes I feel like I just want to go home and live my old life in Boston with all of the family together and getting along. Supposedly my mom and sister were "unhappy" but you could never tell that when they were actually living there. I think they're lying to themselves, but whatever. I miss the change in seasons and unbearable weather 80% of the time. I miss waiting for the bus and knowing how it all will happen and what I'll say and what he'll say in response. I miss the culture; that "I'm way too stressed and busy to waste time 'chatting' attitude. It makes me want to be better. It creates a thirst in me that I can't find here in LA.   I want to go back and I will someday. I will go home and raise my family where the kids know a little more than the weather, time of day, and local news.   I LOVE BOSTON!   Knowing me though, I will just wish I was somewhere else as soon as I live there for a while again. But I'm different now. I can feel it. That is all.           -- Feanor

      I have recently had a series of unusually odd, well, completely off the wall, dreams. I don't usually have odd dreams and I almost never dream of the same thing twice and remember it, but these past few days have been really different. I have this one dream where I'm in a futuristic mall type place and everything is neon and has a 50ish foot ceiling and I always walk into the same store. It's a video game store with the same kids there and the same guys walking aroud, but each time I go there I do something different. What's particularly odd about this is that the NDC (Non Dreamer Characters) remember what I said and did while I was there last time. That's never happened to me before. There's this other dream I had too regarding my recently decieced cousin John Marie where after being decieved by my own perception and realizing it and being pissed off I find a 12mm handgun and start emptying the clip into a wooden fence. I fire 9 rounds and realize that someone might be on the other side of the fence so I go and check to find that no one's dead, but I find a group of suspicious people who I later find out are from a secret political party. This one cloaked guy tries to stab me with a kitchen knife. Of course he fails after I do some tricky stuff with my left hand to disarm him. I am now surrounded by 3 men, 1 stabber dude, and this one cute girl who were all in the original group. I stab one of the people under the ribcage after thinking that it would be too difficult to push the knife in and pull out if it went through his ribs. And when I pulled it out his wound was open but no blood poured out, however the knife was bloody (which I guess is pretty normal, but I have never dreamed in such detail before). It's kinda fuzzy after that but I end up shooting someone who I see later in the dream who doesn't die. When I shot him though, when the bullet entered, it was insanely realistic. No movie-type special effects or bullet wounds that don't bleed or anything. It was just so detailed and graphic. I also stab the girl after she tries some move on me, but I'm careful not to stab her tit so I stab right under the ribs again. There was a scene change and the story progresses on and on, but I won't bore you with it. I guess the dream isn't that weird, but my attention to detail is what amazed me.  THESE LINES ARE UNRELATED TO THIS PARAGRAPH: I HATE PETER'S KEYBOARD. ALL THE KEYS TAKE 2000 POUNDS OF FORCE TO RESPOND AND STICK ONCE YOU PRESS THEM. I GET EXHAUSTED AFTER USING THEM FOR 3 MINUTES/ I REALLY NEED TO BUY HIM A NEW KEYBOARD. HE SEEMS TO HAVE THIS DILUSSION THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SUFFER WHEN YOU USE A COMPUTER. wRONG-o, MAN. TOO MUCH DILBERT FOR YOU.  Getting back to what I was saying about my dreams, it's just weird. Like I said before, I don't want to go into too much detail (even though I went through a lot just then) because it's pretty uninteresting to even people with the most boring of lives. There's this other dream that I've had like three times in the past week and it also picks up where it left off. It's a dream about JM. I think I might not fully recognise that he's dead yet, but I am so confused by it all >_  ^ There is all kinds of redundancy in that past paragraph but I'm too lazy and I hate Peter's keyboard too much to fix it now. I'll work on it later. ^  Moving on, I still hate this stupid keyboard. I am exhausted. Peter is just asking for RSI. Ok, now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the important issues. Moronic tabbers on olga.net. I hate morons who tab a normal chord as something absurdly awkward. A perfect example is tabbing C, G, and D as something other than the way they should be played. Someone decided it was smart to take a perfectly normal chord and arrange it such that three fingers are on one fret. For all of you wont don't play guitar, you almost never put more than two fingers on the same fret unless you're barring the whole thing or the fingers are at least a string apart. It's just so stupid. I am gonna make a site dedicated to taking stupid and poorly written tabs and rewriting them the way they should be, and of course it will be free. I haven't decided on a domain name or anything yet, but I will over the summer and news and updates and the like will be posted here among other places. I hope I can get Peter in on this, but he's got a lot of school work to avoid -- Eehh, I mean do.  We went up to the hill that JM crashed on yesterday and had a mass for him. We didn't have any beers or anything exciting like that, but we DID play some songs on our guitars for him. T'was nice I think, but a bit disturbing to see where it all went down. I miss JM. Rest in Peace, cousin.  Anyway, this keyboard is making me sick to my gut and I feel like vomitting so I am gonna go now. That is all.         -- Feanor

      That's how it goes right? I took the SATs today and I feel pretty good about myself. Deep breath and long exhale. It's a big relief to finally have that off my chest. To describe my feeling, I will use an old analogy of mine: It was like holding it for like 4 hours and then finally letting go. It kinda hurts the whole time because you were holding it for so long, but it's kinda relieving at the same time, but at the end of it all, you feel a WHOLE lot better. And for all of you with sick minds, that was not a sexual reference thing... even though it works for that too :-\.  After I got back from taking THE TEST I chatted a bit, Halo'd a bit, guitar'd a tiny bit, SC'd a bunch and ate. It was a good day off. Oh, tonight I also saw Shrek 2. I liked it, but the whole time I felt like I was laughing harder than everyone else in the theater. Pout.  Man, it's good to be back on bnet sometimes. I get to talk to old friends like PoundCake, tarElendil, Eld, the moronic xojoe, and others. Today in a game of diplo PC and I were reminiscing about the good old days of hy and how it was once REALLY elite. The place is full of newbs now. It's just a really pisser because we can never get a decent game of die, tfh, or anything going without some newb fishstick leaving in the middle. It's just so aggravating, but it's nice to have had those days of perfect pulls from bob, amazing barbs, and near-perfect trigger prep. Good times.  We'll miss you Redender, Refugee_2, Virusfromhell, Eld, tarElendil, Mafia, Little~Mang, and all the others who have departed from our realm. Tear.  I'm going to my uncles graduation tomorrow and then I go to my cousins before I go up north with him to the hill to see the crash site. We will always remember you John Marie St. Francis. Rest In Peace. (This one's a real dedication. The last one was more a joke than anything else. We do miss them too though, just not as much.)  In conclusion, lawyers lawy, fathers fath, mothers moth, and sisters sist. There is nothing we can do about it so why complain? Actually, that reminds me! I heard that they might reinstate the draft in the US which sucks because I'm drafting age. I hate George W. Bush's guts, by the way. I personally think he's a dickhead and I can prove it logically to anyone who's interested. Anyway, I've been thinking about whether I would dodge the draft or not and at first I thought "Shit, man! I'm dodging that thing. EVEN if I have to move to CAMBODIA! I'm not fighting for a draft-dodging prick like Dubya. What a cockbiting fucktard." But then I thought about how that might effect my future career options and then I realized that if I dodge this draft, it'll look really bad on my record if I want to run for president or senator or congressman and I just can't afford to make a mistake like that this early in my career. I'm still torn on the issue so please help me out. Slantface.  In [real] conclusion, I still haven't had any fish yet but I had some Lay's Stax and they were really good. I am tired.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      The hardest part of writing in this blog thingy is the friggin' title. I can never come up with good ones, in my opinion anyway. It doesn't matter really.  I like fish. It's been a while since I've had some, must be approaching two or three months now. Anyway, I think I'm gonna go find a place to order a good filet o' salmon after the 9th or so.  I take the SAT tomorrow morning at 8. I actually forgot that people did stuff when it was 8 other than take midnight leaks or eat midnight snacks or fight incessantly over whether it's wrong to cheat on your spouse right outside your friggin' room which is divided only by the thinnest of plywood and some whitish paint. I'm looking forward to it in a way, and really dreading it at the same time. Well, I guess it comes down to this, and if not this, to November and if not November, next year. My life is bigger than this test, so it won't end if I do less-than-par on it. It will just disappoint me and wish I studied more. But would I ever do anything about it?  PFFT!! NO! That would defeat the purpose of... not umm... WHATEVER!    Moving on, today was good. I followed all the directions.     1. Relax    2. Don't cram    3. Relax    4. ... Uh...    4. ... Relax.  I followed all the steps and for relaxation I figured out how to play a bunch of songs on my guitar and beat Pillar of Autumn, Halo, and The Truth and Reconciliation levels of Halo on Heroic. It's actually easier than I thought it would be. Those invisable sword dudes are a real bugger though. And the entire time I was listening to either Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, or The Get Up Kids.  Let's see... what else did I do today? I ate some chips and a chicken sandwich and some twizzlers... Oh, I also took a shower and brushed my teeth... made my bed... Ah, I also played a bit of SC this morning.  So yeah, my day was very relaxing. Boring, but relaxing... kinda. :-)  I am tired. I must get to sleep now so that I wake up at a reasonable hour for the test.  That is all.         -- Feanor.

      It's like looking over the horizon...  ...  ...  ... and seeing a massive armada ready to smash the crap out of you while you cry wishing you had something with which to defend yourself... Except that there's no horizon, no ships, and I have something with which to defend myself. So I guess it's not a very good analogy.  I have those damn SATs that I've been mentioning in the last few posts the day after tomorrow. That evil saturday morning. I bet there's a reason for it being on Saturday! It's some kinda... not-Jewish conspiracy to make us all take the test on the jewish day of rest... yeah, that's it. Makes perfect sense to me :-P.  Anyway, I hate those things and so in an effort to calm down as the test approaches, I've been relaxing and playing my guitar and listening to music, chatting online, looking up tabs, playing the occasional game of SC, and I mixed in studying all day. I'd say I worked a good 3 hours today. The rest went to the things listed above and a couple meals... Oh, and a shower.  I practiced that Built to Spill song called Big Dipper. I'm getting a bit better, but the chugga-chuggas are throwing me off. It's a cool song that was passed down to me by Peter who learned it from his brother, John Marie who learned it I-don't-know-how. I submitted the tabs to OLGA yesterday afternoon and still haven't gotten a response. It's not posted on the site either so I guess they haven't gotten to it yet. They said to wait a week so it looks like I've got some waiting to do.  We're (The Michael Stevens are bringing me) to "the hill" on the 8th where we will be remembering great people and playing and doing a few things in their remembrance. It'll be kinda hard for me but I think it'll be for the better.  Moving on, I got 50 bucks today from my grandparents that I am gonna save up towards a new electric guitar (~$1300) :-). I know it'll be a while but still, we have to start somewhere, right?  I am tired. Thank you for reading. May the faithfully departed rest in peace.         -- Feanor

      For those of you who've seen The Big Lebowski, good for you. You'll get what I mean when I explain the title.  For those of you who haven't seen The Big Lebowski, seriously reevaluate your life . . .  No, I'm just kidding . . .   Not really. . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   No, really, I'm not kidding, go reevaluate your life.  Anyway, getting back to what's important, today I realized something. I am a lot less like the dude than I want to be and than I thought I was. I am not cool, I am not relaxed, I don't "fit right in there", I am not "the right man for my time and place". I am not "The dude". Now, that's not very useful information for all of you, but here's where it gets useful. It led to me thinking about everyone else around me and even those who aren't around me. It hit me, none of us are the dude. Yes, I know, it hurts to hear it but think about all the things that make the dude unique and compare it to you and you'll see that I'm right. You don't "fit right in there", you're not the "right man" for your time and place, you're not the dude.  If you doubt it, that's cool, just think about it more and you'll realize that I'm right. And in the end, whether you are the dude or not is just like my opinion, man.  Alright, moving on, I got invited by extension of the Stevens' to the Tom Kaisers' house for memorial day. They're so always so cool and gracious about my being there. I hope I can make it up to them sometime. Always hospitable, always gracious, always... good. I want to be more like them in a lot of ways. I'll be workin' on it for a while now. Anyway, it was just us, like 4 other people and the Tom Kaisers. Before that, on Sunday, I went to mass at TAC as usual and enjoyed it. Megan was there but didn't get to stay long at all; just for like half an hour. Nope, Maria Krestyn wasn't there, but that wasn't the bulk of my reason for going to mass like it used to be. She doesn't show up for Sunday mass anymore during the summer, which is a real bummer for me, but it's not like I'll stop going to mass, as I said earlier. I don't do anything that I'm not pushed into half-assed. Since I'm becoming a catholic, I'm gonna be going all the way, communion, that thing after that, confirmation, that other thing after that, and ya know, the whole thing, fun and not-fun.  I think Megan doesn't just not like me, but actually DISLIKES me. I hope it wasn't anything I did or said. i.e. I hope it was something my family did that reflected badly upon me.  Oh, and I took my 5th practice SAT today. I didn't like how it went. I was forced to omit like 28 questions total, which pisses me off. I have the real thing in like 4 days and I have to get a half-decent score. I hate that thing with such passion that I want to blow up the moon. Yeah, I know it would throw off some kinda solstice thing but I don't really care. Anyway, next couple days will be pure math pain. Sigh.  Ok, what else, I wore really ugly clothes that didn't match at all and I hung out with Peter a bunch and I ate some food and drank a Jamba Juice and ate some breakfast bars and watched the big lebowski and part of the lord of the rings the return of the king and played some command and conquer 95 edition and im'd some people with my sidekick and talked to Kat (she's cool (and pretty)) and got some good words from Ali and listened to Built to Spill and Modest Mouse and came home and watched some red vs blue and cursed at some slow speed internet connection action and yelled at my sister for whining about me not studying (of all people. yeah, i know). Anyway, that wasn't written in any particular order. It was just what I did that came to my mind that I've done in the past few days. So, concluding my long run-on sentence, I will start another because I forgot some stuff. I also practiced my guitar and I'm learning Big Dipper and I'm practicing everything and I went to see JMs grave and I cried to myself and I miss JM and whenever I see a picture of him I hope he didn't die and sometimes I try and make myself believe that he's happier now and that it's worth my suffering and I hate it when people die so don't die because I'll hate it unless I hate you, in which case I'll thank the good lord above :-P. Have a nice night and a pleasant and safe tomorrow.  In conclusion, the fish will swim and the man will talk. The cow will walk and the dog will do tricks. None of that has anything to do with anything. Bye.          -- Feanor.

      Ok, so here's the first real post in a while. Sorry about that shoddy business back there, but I just have been kind of lazy and discouraged. Actually, lazy's not the right word, "being in a perpetual semi-exhausted state" is slightly more fitting, I think. In any event, as you hopefully know by now, I'm in LA now. I landed on the VERY early morning of 27th (like ~1:30AM).  So, the day before yesterday I went to work and ended up sitting around most of the day waiting on other people for information and help so I ended up getting very little done, but at least I FTP'd my filed to my computer so that I could work on them. Yay!... I guess. By the time I got home I didn't want to do anything 'cept sleep and/or talk to one of my few friends, so I did just that.  The next morning, I decided not to go to work and do something useful like mask brains because Peter and Co. were coming in from Ventura and I didn't want to miss 'em for work that I could do later. It turned out that they showed up like 7 hours late and I essentially wasted the day waiting. Thanks a lot, guys. When they finally came though, I whipped out my old mic  and we recorded some fun stuff of us just messing around with guitars and singing slow sappy songs :-D. Leave a message in the comments if you want me to post 'em temporarily, meaning for about a week (they're kinda big and long), and I will gladly do so :-). I think it's pretty funny, but that might be because I like to be embarrassed. I don't know why exactly, but I seem to be noticing a pattern.  Anyway, today we recorded another one of those 10 minute session things, ate, walked around, messed with the guitars, walked around my house, and did some other small things like get a Jamba Juice, which, for those of you who don't know, are these fruit smoothie things that are pretty gosh darn friggin' good. I didn't get one though because I didn't feel like it enough to spend 3 bucks on it, so yeah.  After spending most of the day doing things around the house, my cousin and I took a couple busses and our legs to get to guitar center to buy a mic stand and a strap and to try out the electric guitars. We got there and met this guy who worked there named Andy who we later found out is pretty friggin' awesome in terms of guitar skills. We asked him where what we needed was and he pointed us in the right direction and we looked around for a bit and decided that we don't really NEED a mic stand and that it was 25+ bucks better spent elsewhere, or not spent at all. After deciding on that though, we went to the guitar strap section and I picked one out that came out to about 15 or 17 bucks. It's made out of the same material as the safety-belts in cars, at least it feels that way. At first I didn't really like the pattern, but stuck with it because it was the lesser of the many evils. However, after having worn it for a couple hours, I kinda like it. After buying my strap, we met up with Andy again and we got a history lesson on electric guitars and he played a bit for us to demonstrate the difference between the two main types. I was inspired to practice and learn and be awesome :-). I also found the guitar that I want to buy. It's an 800 dollar red fender stratocaster. Ya know, after playing acoustic even for as little as a few months, the electric guitar feels so damn easy. Also the sound is so friggin' cool! Woohoo! I think this might become a dangerous addiction >_  After our adventure in Guitar Center, we were pretty hungry, so we went down, or was it up? Anyway, we went some way on Sunset and passed this place called Mashti Malone's Ice Cream, where Bahador had taken me once before, so we got some ice cream. I also decided that I was hungry, so after getting the ice cream, we went to Burger King and ordered two of those 5 piece buck-twenty things off the menu and he got a drink. We ate both the ice cream and the chicken at the same time, and all was good. After eating, we realized it was late and decided that it would be a GOOD idea to run whiles carrying a guitar stand, 100 CD-R's, and other assorted goodies after having just eating just a few minutes before. I don't know what inspired us to do that, but we did it, and boy did we regret it.  We ended up being 6 minutes late to meet with our ride, so they kinda flipped at us, but they didn't seem to mind too much, so whatever :-). Once we got home, we played with the guitars some more, my mom and fiona made cookies and argued over some stupid walnut issue. It was pretty funny because it was more like bickering than anything else, and over what? Walnuts and peanut butter cookies :-)! Peter danced a bit, Javaneh decided that learning the guitar would be a good idea, Peter and I tried to teach her, Peter and I played a couple songs together taking advantage of my new strap and picks :-).   All in all, I guess this was a pretty darn good day. I got to find my true guitar, hung out with my favorite cousin, bought a bunch of stuff that is normally considered frivolous, but is in fact useful, and to top it all off, I didn't get an ounce of work done :-D. Rock on, Feanor!  There were a few other things that were done today too, but I've forgotten them. I'm sorry that this post was unorganized and kind of like just another brain dump. I promise that I will get this place in better shape soon. Please bare with me :-[ >_  That is all. -- Feanor

      Ok, I'm sorry. I haven't been in the mood lately to blog much. I guess I'm a little tired of editing so much darn text. I have a ton of idea to write about during the day and I write about most of them, but deciding which of them are really worthy and which ones to make longer and shorter and then doing so is so long and tedious for me. Anyway, here's another raw brain dump. I took these notes on my  urlLink sidekick  over the course of the day and most of them don't mean anything to anyone except me because I wrote them as something to remind me of the bigger story to tell. Anyway, the post:   Height equality and nation wide ice sticker things. Eaves dropping armchair polititians and running with an idea 4 words long repeated until I have an opportunity to write it down somewhere to write a real post about it. How was it decided that drinks always go on the right and the fork and knife goes where and where? Will to live isn't great for me. I don't really care that much. Stressed spelled backwards. Running out of movie ideas. Sport utilitity ridiculousness, like SUTs, for rizzle. Parking guys who are way too into their job. Halter top for your ass skirts.  As you can see, it's pretty random and meaningless. I swear that I'll do my best to be more entertaining later. I'm sorry, guys :-[.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I just thought I'd let everyone know that this is the 101st post of the blog. Damn, this thing grows faster than I thought.  Anyway, I guess I should do something to celebrate, so here's some stuff I wrote on the plane from Chicago to Boston in SPECIAL UNEDITED FORM :-D. I'd sort it all out and write a nicer post, but I'm in a rush to get to work, so I'll do that later. Just a warning, but each blog post usually goes through like 2 or 3 edits, so I just thought I might warn you. Also, just a random fact, but I start my posts with the hyphen things and expand each idea. They just serve as a kind of reminder of things I deemed worthy to blog, and each one of the hyphens comes out to about -- I dunno, one or two six-sentence paragraphs? I also hack out a bunch of stuff so you might find in the edited version after this, that there will be entire paragraphs missing. It's not that I'm evil, but I try to save myself SOME embarrassment. Anyway, the unedited version i.e. Brain dump:  - didn't want to leave boston... at all - thought i over-slept this morning, but didn't, had mixed feelings - talked to people this morning - read "something positive" - cleaned up the attic a bit, consolidated boxes and the like - read more comics - cleaned a bit more - played guitar for a bit - fell asleep briefly in the lovesack left by andrew and anindita - thought about what to do with PB the piggie and went to pet store to buy a carrier for him and went to the vet to get his papers, but in our valiant effort, still failed to get him onto the plane. Fucking AA bummerness. - went to the airport to drop me off and try to get the people at AA to let me take him on the plane, but like stated above, failed - i got other stuff through fine and waited in terminal - talked to people on sidekick and ended up missing plane because i never heard any last call made, and had mixed feelings about it - set myself up for a later flight through Chicago that would arrive in LA at like 1AM. hey, it's better than nothing, right? - found out that on domestic flights, regardless of whether or not the passenger is on the plane, the luggage still stays on the plane. I didn't know this and thought the international policy went with everyone - bought some food and donuts at the airport, the food for me, the donuts for javaneh because she had asked for them - waited around and talked on sidekick some more. - i miss kat when i don't talk to her for a while. i feel myself getting addicted to her, along with christina. i miss christina a lot. i hope everything with her is going alright - i got on the plane to chicago and it all went well except for the constant nausea I was experiencing. I discovered I can't wear my retainer when I fly because i get freaked out and gag for some reason. Creepin' myself out, here. the flight attendant gave me club soda and i felt a bunch better. i slept most of that flight and sang modest mouse in a half-asleep drunken fashion for the rest of the time - i landed in chicago and walked to the gate and all was well. i got to see clinton speak and he was FUCKING AWESOME!! i mean, wow. just wow. I also met some interesting people from just north of lost angels who were quite funny armchair politicians - felt sick at the start of the flight from chicago and got more club soda, but this time made me feel worse. creepin' me out more. also, i had a headache and asked the dude if he could get me some asprin, but he didn't have any pain killers so the dude in front of me gave me his advil liquid gels and the headache went away. what a nice guy, aside from the fact his chair was down the whole time, the pills made up for it though :-D - found out just how unfitting bob dylan really is to the movie "laws of attraction" - wrote this list on the plane and will probably just obsess over kat and christina and dream about them for the rest of the flight. I'm a bit of a loser, i know. I miss them both so much. i wish i could talk to them online on the plane, even though Christina's in like Florida without an internet connect. It makes me sad. Anyway, i was talking to kat before the plane took off and i told her that i liked her personality, as flat out as i could without having my heart and head explode. She said I was "such a suck up" to which I replied "that might be true, but I can't help it, really... Well, I guess i could but I REALLY don't want to. :-)" Isn't she pretty? She's the one on the right with dark hair.   :'( before i make myself throw up at my own loser-like obsessive behavior, i'll just stop and keep it all in until i crack. that's how i usually handle it and while the tactic's never worked the way i wanted in the long run, it's the only one i can do without hating myself while i do it.  Moving on, the past days haven't been bad. they were like the other ones though. i mean, andrew and anindita moved a lot more stuff in and i got taken out to dinner for helping at route 99; not a bad place. "cheap meat" as chloe likes to say. She's cute too :-), but i don't have any picture to show. Andrew's mom and sister (Chloe) saw the house for the first time last night and really liked it. How could they not? The place is great. Really, it is great and I'm not letting my 5 years of living there taint my rating.  A few thoughts of the day, I feel like I never had a real childhood. When I think back to when I was little, from about 7 to 15, I don't remember things like friends, family, and fun times. I remember more things like worry, fighting, loneliness, tough and painful existential questions, and self-hate. I also remember this constant pressure to be something greater than I could possibly conceive at the age. I miss the days when I knew I had the option to just spend the day and waste it. I think that's why I'm having such a hard time growing up now. I don't feel like I ever had a "real" childhood, so I keep craving it and since there's no real structure in place to force me to grow up, i try to go back. Whenever I think about it though, I just get depressed because it only amplifies the fact that now I'm 16.65 or so and I just simply don't have the time to do that anymore. I need to grow up fast now, get my act together, and my ass in gear to get into a great college because I know if I don't shoot for the best, I'll hate myself for selling myself short and will want to die. I hate the catch 22 that my mind has for me. I know that somewhere in me there's the key to the box with the solution to this problem, but that would take time to find, time I don't have because i've got so much shit to do, like learn a fuckload of math and study for those damn SATs again and just all these things that MIT or places like that would want to see. Maybe I fucked up. Maybe I need to take a year off and take my time. Why am I killing myself to get to the same place as everyone else at the same age? My life situation was not normal by almost any means and, while in a lot of ways it was easier, it was made dramatically harder in other ways.  It also dawned on me today just how few friends I have that aren't related to my dad's work. I know close to NO ONE that I can speak openly with without worrying that it will effect my dad's career or something like that. It's so depressing for me because it makes me feel truly alone in the world, like if I were to die, how full would the church be, really? Would the few people who knew me in life fly from their cities to see me for one final time? I'd like to think so, and I know my family would show up, but they're kind of obligated to. But would Ali show up, would Dan show up, would Chris, Tim, or Andrew show up? I honestly don't know if they'd show up more for me or the ramifications of not coming because of my dad. It makes me just... :'(  Anyway, I think I've whined to all of you enough and if you actually read the paragraphs above without just skimming, you're one of my new favorite people.  Moving on, I'm writing this post on the plane from Chicago to LA, and I'm now listening to the audiobook for The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien, and I feel I have to say that I like the theology of Tolkien a bit better than the christian one. I mean, perhaps if christianity weren't taken so literally, it might be more reasonable, but people seem to be stupid and like to take things as they see it and not read into the important parts of it. The Silmarillion, however, is kind of hard to take as pure fact, even though I'm sure some silly people do, because it's so... fanciful. I've listened to The Silmarillion a few times before, so I know the majority of major parts of the stories by heart and I think that they are all really great because they carry the same great morals of the biblical-style stories, but they don't... what do I mean to say? They don't make it out to -- well, it's, like, harder for me to take as pure fact and seems harder to turn into a tool with which to breed hate. I don't know, I just REALLY love the books. They're awesome. I think that if people here get into reading in general and have 15 bucks, go to a book store and buy the purple paperback with a picture of elves sitting on grass by a body of water and some trees. I'm sorry for not just giving the publisher's name, but I've forgotten it so I did my best to describe the cover. In any event, it's a great book so go buy it and read it when you get a chance :-).  Oh, also, by the way, I've been spelling Anindita's name Anandita. I've been wrong. It's Anindita. I just thought I'd make that clear :-).  That is all. -- Feanor

      So, I was thinking tonight, as I lied on the couch staring at the imperfections in the paint no the ceiling, what would I do if a foreign country, as opposed to a domestic one, declared war on the US and landed on it's beaches and started razing our cities and raping our women and the like? Would I leave and go to a neutral country and wait it out? Would I fight for my homeland? Would I fight for the other side? And in trying to answer all these questions, I had to ask myself "What does America mean to me?" meaning why do I love it? Do I even love it? Is it the land, the people, or the philosophy or the ideals or a little bit of all that makes me so attached to the place? And of course, what makes me not want to move to any other place, even after taking into consideration all the flaws in this country?  I came to the following conclusion, I would fight for my country, but not because any president or leader me so, but because I'd be fighting for something more than just an individual. I'd be fighting for an idea, no matter how poorly US keeps to it now, that you are nothing if not free to express and think what you want. It's kind of like how that guy, I forget his name, but he said something to the effect of "I may disagree with what you say, but I respect it and will die for your right to say that." So, yeah, I'd fight for my country despite it's flaws because the ideals are great, not necessarily the individuals we have in place now.  In conclusion, I'm not afraid to fight and die for something, I'm just very skeptical about what is worth such an expense.  I love The United States of America, forever my home.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Sorry for not having posted this sooner, but I've been kind of distracted... That, and a little lazy. In any event, I'm just gonna sum up what's been happening over the past few days, to what I look forward and what I dread over the next few days, and a little bit of what's on my mind. Anyway, onto the actual post...  The past few days have been almost identical in terms of what I did, thought about, and just everything, so I'll just say it once. I woke up at around 11 and read the everyday funnies, checked out the front page of new york times and compared it to foxnews.com. It's a really funny comparison, I think. I find Fox News to be incredibly sensational and lacks real content and instead replaces it with essentially an opinion or someone's "spin" on it (because they love to say that they don't any of that... right), while new york times is just sensational, occasionally lacks real content, but opinion and fact are almost always separated clearly. It also doesn't have an obvious cant to either side, left or right.  Moving on, I've been getting into Bob Dylan lately and he's kind of a god in my mind right now. There's nothing like a jewish cowboy, I say ;-) (Robert Zimmerman is his real name). My third grade teacher actually went to the same high school as him at the same time. She says she knew him and that he was a cool kid, which is just friggin' awesome. In any event, I've been really getting into his music and so far, if I had to pick a favorite song, it'd be either 'Along The Watchtower' or 'John Brown'. I like the lyrics to 'John Brown', they can be found  urlLink here . He's so cool, man. Too cool, perhaps.  In any event, I've also been playing much too much Warcraft III. I recently got frozen throne from Ali so I installed it I've been going through the campaigns. I'm on the undead one now, chapter 4 I think. For those who know the game, it's the level where you land on the beach and you have to kill a blood elf base before a base can be established. Anyway, I've been playing too much and that's been buggin' my head. I'm getting kind of sick of the game though so I think I'll be fine by the end of the week. That game has horrible replay value. SC is a lot more fun in terms of replaying it. That's just my opinion though.  On a happy note, I've been playing my guitar a bit and it's been fun, as usual. It's funny, I think, how whenever I do a guess the song, I mess up like 5 times in the recording, but just days, sometimes even hours later, I play it flawlessly. It's kind of frustrating, but maybe I mess up because I'm nervous :-[.  Speaking of things that make me nervous and awkward, I've been staying up to wee hours of the morning every morning for the past long while talking to a certain someone on AIM. I enjoy it... a lot. It's, quite honestly, the best part of my day and I've been wondering what I'm gonna do when she goes to florida with no internet connection >_  Another topic that I'm not too comfortable with, but one that's a relatively big part of my life now is cleaning the house up and preparing it for Andrew and Anandita. Ya know, when I went into my old room and cleaned up and emptied it's remaining contents into my sister's old room, which is being used a temporary "put your random and to-be-sorted crap here" room, I sat on the bench that's now in there and nearly broke into tears. It's really depressing to leave this place for me. Just thinking about not ever really seeing it again makes me immensely depressed and a little angry, but I try not to let either overtake me. I mean, I lived in this apartment for 5 years and I have a lot of memories of just... stuff that's happened here. I guess it would have happened eventually though. I mean, it is, after all, an apartment and we don't own the place, but I wish it could have been after I went to college. We, my immediate family, still don't have a house or piece of land or anything to call our own, so I guess until we buy something, I'll be doomed to painful moving experiences from apartment to apartment. This stupid knot in my throat is making my typing very difficult...  Moving on, the weather in Boston is really humid and a bit hot so no matter how much I bathe, I will always feel disgusting. I developed a heat rash on my chest and back a couple days back that lasted a day or so and it kinda freaked me out, but it's gone now. I've asked myself this many times, and I still have no real idea what the answer is: Why in god's name, would anyone set up a colony in a place like this with crappy weather and soggy land, despite the innumerable previous failed attempts to colonize it? It boggles my mind.  I get my retainer tomorrow morning at 8:45, which means that I either have to go bed really early tonight, which I don't think I will, or stay up all night and go in the morning. I think I'll end up doing the latter just because it's a bit easier for me and the sleep schedule I have now. When I go there, they're also gonna look at my molars and check if I have any cavities because I called the orthodontist's office up today and said that I'm no extremely sensitive to cold, and moderately sensitive to hot foods, and not that it's new, but I'm also sensitive to citrus. My teeth suck, I know. Anyway, they said that it's normal for teeth to be sensitive for a few weeks or months because of the bands that wrap around the molars protect 'em and make 'em kinda wimpy. So, they're gonna take a look and let me know tomorrow. I hope it's nothing too bad :-\.  I'm lonely right now, but it's not because I'm staying in the old house alone. I feel lonely no matter where I am or who I'm with. It's really crappy and a little more than a little cliché, but I just feel like I'm missing something or someone in my life. I don't know what it is, but whenever I think about it, my heart does this weird thing it does where it feels like it sinks in my chest and it's a yucky feeling that I remember getting in certain situations with Shannon. I don't know anymore. Why -- no, What -- na', How -- shit, I don't even know what the question that I'm trying to ask myself is. I'm horribly confused, but god forbid I show it to the world in person. Everyone would try to "help" me by asking questions I've already asked myself and run through 400 times from the 5+ personalities/perspectives in my head. I'm sorry, I don't really WANT to let this out, but for some reason, I feel I should. Thanks for reading this far, anyway.  Tomorrow I'm gonna finally do some more math. I have a three-quarter-hearted goal to reach so I'd better put 135% into it, maybe it'll make up for my lack of enthusiasm, or perhaps even create it. Who am I to complain though? My life is good for the most part. I have a family that loves me and calls everyday just to hear my voicemail greeting and I'm sitting here, on top of the world, and yet I still manage to find something to whine about. I've got food and a roof over my head and I don't have to worry about my country breaking out into civil war anytime soon... Or do I :-P?  Anyway, I could go on and on trying to justify my complaints, but I just don't see the real reason in them anymore. I came up with those arguments for the point a year or so ago and it's just old to me now. It served it's purpose and I feel like they're not valid anymore because they're old. It's stupid. I know it's almost the same exact scenario and the argument still holds true, but I can't bring myself to see it as valid. What's worse is that I CAME UP WITH THE ARGUMENT MYSELF! AKH!  Anyway, I think I've whined enough. I'd be amazed if you actually read this far, and I thank you very much.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Today I noticed a note left on my desk in my handwriting saying to write a post about this funny story about a fish when I was in LA. So, I was called here today to write a story about a fish and, what the note apparently says, a marmot. The only thing is that I don't remember ever having a funny story or experience, or even someone else's funny story or experience to share. I don't remember having one. Period. New sentence. And so, comma, with that said, comma, there will be no story told. Period. New sentence. There is no story. Period. New Sentence. There's nothing more to see in this post except a signature, comma, so... Short pause. sorry :-\. Slantface. Period. New sentence. I'm sure you'll find something to do on the net other than read a story about a fish and a marmot. Period.  That is all. Period. -- Feanor

      FINALLY!! Here it is, the fifth guess the song. I'm still working on that other one, by the way. I felt kind of bad though not doing anything music-wise, so I thought of songs and this is just the first one that came to mind. I looked for the tabs and figured out how to play it, so here it is. It's pretty simple, but still :-).  As usual, leave guesses in the comments, and please guess even if someone already has put what you think is the right answer or wrong answer or whatever. Just say hi, even.    urlLink

      This is the eighth and final installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  February 2nd, 2004  Just Another Day  It's just another (It's just another day) It's just another (It's just another day) It's just another day--When people wake from dreams  With voices in their ears--That will not go away 	-- Oingo Boingo  "Yeah, it's kinda like that"  So ends another day in the same old fashion. Mom's looking for a job, I'm listening to music, writing my 'blog, surfing the net, talking to people i.e. Being unproductive. The whole of the day wasn't much different. Instead of playing SC, I played civ2 today. It wasn't bad and was, in fact, kinda fun. But it still stopped me from doing something better with my time all the same.  Anyway, mom wanted us to all go for a walk today and I didn't really want to go but in the end decided to go with her and my sister. My mom tried to convince me to buy a Jamba Juice, but knowing our financial situation, I decided against it so she tried to convince me "to feel ok buying one" by calling my dad and having him tell me that we had the funds, or that even if we didn't that I should feel fine getting it anyway. MY dad didn't say that and as usual my mom's plans backfired and ended up making me look reasonable (Which I was). But he did say that if I wanted it, I should get it.  So once we got that done with, Javaneh decides that she's gonna throw an insult my way and maybe be funny or something but I didn't think it was funny and replied with something sharp and quick-witted, which my mom didn't appreciate because it kinda hit her too. So my mom walked back home and shouted "I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm going home! I can't take this!" so Javaneh and I tried to get her to come back but she wouldn't come back. We did, however, get her to stop at the corner of Beverly and Charleville and talk about possible places to go and hang out if she didn't like being at home. But we came to the conclusion that not only did our finances allow us to do something like that, but there wasn't anywhere that we really wanted to go anyway.  Once we were home I started playing games after doing a few small things like eating and sitting on my bed and the like. I've been playing for most of the time since then :-( I hate it when that happens. In any event, not much happened. Mom still looked for jobs and I didn't talk to anyone or anything. Javaneh watched TV and we found out that our apartment has a plumbing problem. Whatever goes in the garbage disposal shoots out of the shower drain. That sucks... a lot. And so ends the majority of meowMix's day. It's the same ol' same ol' thing if you know what I mean. 	>>meowMix  February 2nd, 2004  Ya know what I mean?  This is regarding Shannon and me, how I wish we connected better and understood each other's different life-styles better.  It seems to me that Shannon doesn't know exactly what I mean... Every time I see her she's mad at me when I leave even after I've told her how hard it is to get any time with her. I think I get what she means when she says that I should just disregard my family and do what 'I' want, but maybe that's just an illusion and I don't really understand her frame of mind.  I talked to Peggy about this and she said that she understood the situation but didn't know what to do about it. She said that Shannon's never had a family so she doesn't understand what it means to have family or the pressures that come with it. I told Peggy about how the only time I tell Shannon about my family is when I'm mad at them and that her perception of them is probably off and perhaps is leading to her lack of respect for them. As you can tell, I had told her about how Shannon never really says thanks to people who give her some kinda service.  Anyway, I just feel bad now because I love Shannon and I'm near-certain she still loves me but I don't know how to show her anymore because it just always feels like I'm never doing enough. I want her to feel loved but I need to feel loved in return to a certain extent. I miss what we had before Jordan. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to place blame but it just feels different now. Maybe we've just grown up and the shallow things that we would use to express our care for one another don't mean anything anymore because we're passed it. Maybe we've just grown out of it and we're a stronger bond, but maybe I'm just dreaming. I wish there was something I could do to make her feel the same way for me as she used to. And I wish I could do the same for me.  I miss the tingle, the little nuances, and the excited, non-paranoid, doubtful Shannon. I think I'm just reminiscing on old times. I don't know but I know that I love her and I want her to know that. 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of and the series 'Blast From The Past'. I hope you enjoyed it. Actually, I could give a rat's ass is if most of you enjoyed it. I only hope a few certain people did and I hope that no one reasonable was offended by what was said.  That is all. -- Feanor

      AH! I haven't been in the mood for writing much lately, so I haven't, but I have a very keen memory so I'll be writing the usual logs again pretty soon. I'll also write the stuff that's been happening over the past couple days, so just be patient. Oh, and I haven't forgotten about guess the song. I've been practicing this one song for a while now, but I keep messing up at this one part, so just lemme get it right and I'll have it up. Thanks for waiting, guys.

      This is the seventh installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  February 1st, 2004  A Great Day That Ended Sadly  A day with Shannon that went just like any day with Shannon can be expected.  I woke up relatively late. I'd say about 9AM or so. And I got up and succumb to SC as usual. At around 11AM I got off the game and took a shower. Then my mother, sister, and I got into a fight about differences in mentality and it ended with my mom and sister leaving to sit in the car. I later went back and apologized and she said "oh, forget it" but I know what that means. It means "yeah, whatever. I'm still mad at you but I'll pretend to be the bigger person and just say 'don't worry about it." Whatever.  Anyway, after that my mom called my dad and my dad called me as I was leaving to see shannon at around 12:50. We talked and he gave me some advice such as "keep your mouth shut. Just listen and be frustrated but keep it in." I'll keep that in mind from now on. Anyway, after that I went to catch the bus and waited for 10 or so minutes for the Santa Monica West 720 at Beverly / Wilshire. When the bus showed up I realized I didn't have any dollar bills (but I forgot that I had dollar coins) and traded a 5 dollar bill for two dollars and 35 cents from another guy who was waiting at the stop. He was very grateful so after realizing I had dollar coins I didn't feel as bad about it.  Once I was on the bus I was happy enough because I was on my way to see my Shannon but this silly Los Angles group of people decided to "dance", not on the corner of the intersection, but rather IN the intersection. The bas couldn't be stopped and hit one of them in the arm or something like that. I didn't see it first hand but I heard a lot about it and the whole situation just seemed stupid. I hope the bus driver isn't held responsible for it. Anyway, after the first bus was stopped I got on the next bus, which was a 720 West Westwood bus and I told him I needed to get to Barrington and Wilshire so he stopped at the next stop and gave me an all day pass at no additional charge. After that I called Shannon on the phone and told her about the whole situation. Then the bus came and I hung up and got on.  When I got to my destination I was standing at the back door of the bus and this grouchy gay guy was mad at the driver and told everyone by the door to push it open (even though the door said "opens automatically"). The man then shouted at the driver saying that it's a crowded bus and a solid "Fuck you!" I then walked up Barrington and called Shannon again and talked all the way up. I hung up and asked her to let me in before I got there so I wouldn't have to wait so long, but I still ended up waiting a minute or two.  I hung out at her house for a bit and a few things happened... not a lot, I just waited for her to finish up her game, while surfing the net. Some drama occurred that's not really worth going into too much detail about, but whatever.  After this whole episode was done we went down to San Vincente and bought a subway and thought of stories to tell the parents in the event they ever asked what we did the whole time and came to a conclusion. We went to subway where she got a wrap and I went to ColdStone where I got my ice cream. We ate our food and went down to Peggy's shop. We hung around there for a while and when Peggy was done with her last client, she took us to get her a sub. Shannon and I wanted to go to Westwood and walk around but my mom wasn't up to that so we just went to her house and I talked to Peggy about how I felt regarding Shannon.  I told her about how I felt that no matter what I do, it feels like it's never enough with her and how my parents felt about her and why it was so hard to get a day to see her. She totally understood and was able to compare and contrast the two life-styles. I think that Peggy's a great lady and I still love Shannon. I want her to trust me and love me back but I don't know if she could do that in the same way she used to. 	>>meowMix  February 1st, 2004  Shannon and I  Are the feelings mutual?  I love Shannon but I don't know if she loves me. I feel so bad for not being able to do more for her and I only wish I could make her happy. I need Shannon to love me and care for me and need me and want me to be with her always, the same way I do. I miss her. 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  I actually don't ever remember being THAT needy. How odd. Well, if the blog says so, it must be so because I don't lie in these things. I never lie anyway, I just forget or honestly remember things inaccurately :-\.  That is all. -- Feanor

      This is the sixth installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  January 31th, 2004  The Tale of The ÜberLoser and The Man of ÜberAspirations  If The ÜberLoser is one who is addicted to computer games and wastes at least 3 hours a day on them, then am I The ÜberLoser? But if The Man of ÜberAspirations is a man who wants to do great things then which am I?  Well, it looks like I've failed in trying to break my SC addiction yet again, but did you really think I'd succeed? At least yesterday I did something productive to not make me feel so bad and today I went through a week's worth of math but I don't feel satisfied. I MUST DO MORE!!!  So, with that said, I vow to, at the cost of my sleep (if I must) to get at least 7 hours of solid work done a day. This will probably fail too though :-\ But really, do you really expect me to succeed at anything? Wish me luck anyway.  My self-assessment is "ÜberTormented"... Whatever that means. 	>>meowMix  January 31th, 2004  Hermit? Naw...  Socially Inept? Me?! I am offended, however true it might be! :-P  To be honest, I don't see myself as socially inept but I sometimes wonder if I'm "normal" because I don't feel much drive to ever leave the house unless I have something to do. Anyway, before I left the house yesterday, I hadn't left the house for 4 days and today I didn't even step outside of my door. I'm kinda surprised at how long it's taken for me to feel depressed and why I still don't yet feel depressed.  When I was back in Boston I had to leave the house at least once every other day otherwise I would go insane and unleash on my poor father. (Looking back, that wasn't very nice of me. Poor dude.) Anyway, I should be going out to see Shannon tomorrow if my mother will let me, so I will get to see one person up close and I'll be able to observe all kinds of other people at the same time. That should be nice. I'm looking forward to it and hope it will be as pleasant and I imagine it :-). 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'.

      Ok, so if you've been reading this blog, you probably have this impression that I hate my mom or at least dislike her, while I love and admire and bla bla bla my dad. While it is true that I all-those-good-things my dad, my mom is also very cool too. Just keep that in mind. My mom is a good lady and is highly cool. Period. End of story. And I don't even want a comment on the subject, unless it's from my mom agreeing. The silly lady found out about this damn thing and now feel really bad, but I'm not just writing this to make her feel better. I honestly mean it, my mom is cool and awesome and very nice lady and all that good stuff.  That is all. -- Feanor

      This is the fifth installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  January 29th, 2004  The Random Ranting of Old  Mother Dearest yelling and crying and whining over a site that was down but gave obscure error messages  My mom was looking for a job and in her search she found out about surveys that you could take online for which you would be financially compensated. So she looks around the web to find some sites that offer this service and shortly after starting, finds one that she likes. She looked around the page to see how she would get the money after taking the survey and she was totally fine with it so she clicked on the thing to sign up.  There are three ways to pay the one-time $35 down that you have to pay to use the service. This is where it gets ugly. She first decided that she wants to do it through PayPal but was unable because she forgot her password. So she decided to pick another option that was labeled "pay with credit card or check online." She clicked the link and filled in her state and zip code... (and here's where it gets good) She clicks the continue button and (BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUUUUMMM) IT DOESN'T WORK!!  "HOLY FUCKIN' SHIT!! A SITE WITH A FORM THAT DOESN'T WORK!! WHA HO HOOO!! THIS IS REALLY FRIGGIN' HEAVY STUFF!" my mom must be thinking to herself as she starts getting mad at the site and doing the same thing to it over and over and over again. So she asks me what's wrong after several attempts at fixing it  the same way over and over again. I suggest that the site that's responsible for payment may be down or they're doing maintenance. This seems reasonable enough to her so she waits... and she waits... and she waits... for a whole 5 minutes. And she tries again and it still doesn't work. She does this twice again and finally cracks.  She unleashed fury of which even Melkor would have been afraid and she cursed Illúvatar and told Tolkien to shove his gods up his ass and that god was not on her side. And then she changed her rants to a whole different subject. That of her cookies, for which she had thought she had a perfect recipe (and she did). Here's the thing, it's not like the recipe she used the first time didn't pan out. She changed it and then ranted as if her old cookies failed! She went on for like 10 minutes doing this. I amazingly managed to keep my mouth shut.  The moral of this story is that my mother needs to grow up and smell the withering tulips because life is not a rose garden in which all things are perfect and will always go your way no matter what you do. LORD, save her please. And if not her from her ignorance, save me from being subject to it :-P. >> meowMix  January 30th, 2004  Better Late Than Never  This is a log of the 29th of January that I forget to put together at the end of the day. I will be writing the message as if I were doing it last night. I met the lady with whom I'll be working at UCLA.  Well, today I woke up at at the ungodly hour of 5:45AM to go to the UCLA volunteer orientation and to meet some people for whom I will be working. I got out of bed at 6:15 to find that The Postal Service was playing. I knew that I had turned it off last night so I thought it had to be my mom or sister, AND IT WAS! My mom said that I had gotten her used to listening to music in the morning and she was so used to hearing them in the morning that it felt quiet without it. I feel special.  At 6:45 we left for my uncle's place so that we could go to UCLA together an on the way he gave me a talk about how to hold myself and behave. I had no problem with this and was, in fact, thankful that he pointed out a few things. While at UCLA I checked at the volunteer office to see if I had to fill anything out only to find out that the orientation was cancelled.  After finding out about this, I was very disappointed but helped Babak set up, clean up, and while he was working on his first patient I called my mom to see if she could spend an hour in Westwood with me. She said that it's take a while to get to UCLA from where she was so I spent that time downstairs looking through the BioMed Library. I found some journals on Diabetes that were cool but I didn't understand them.  It was about 10:20 when my mom finally showed up and we went to get some food at In-N-Out. We also picked up a salad for Babak at Corner's Bakery. When we were done eating, it was about 11:20AM so my mom took me back to UCLA. I went see if Babak was done and he wasn't so I went down to the BioMed Library again and found a really cool journal called "Evolution and Human Behavior."  After Babak was done with his first patient we met up and he introduced me to Dr. Younai who is for whom I will be working. She's a nice lady but I was very nervous and so I stayed quiet most of the time. I'd like to think I left a good impression though.  After meeting with Dr. Younai, Babak had an Endo (Root Canal) patient and I didn't have much interesting in watching (aside from the fact that the professor who was there at the time didn't like anyone watching anyway) so I called my mom again and she picked me up.  After getting home I didn't do much more than play SC and talk online. I really hate it when that happens and want to stop :-(.  Overall I think this was a good day and hope that more days can be more like this. 	>> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.

      Last night I stayed up all night again and talked on aim and read things and exchanged funny stories and the like. I really enjoy doing that for some reason. I think I'm nocturnal. Anyway, she had to go to bed so I had to find something else to do because I couldn't sleep anymore, not that I'd want to, but I couldn't because the sun was up and in the room and everything and I just have a hard time sleeping with light, generally. So I decided I'd read the news, but got tired of it so I just walked around the house and eventually picked up the guitar and started playing. I also organized and packed up the house a bit more.  I had an appointment at 2:15 so at around 1:37 I left to catch the bus to Harvard square from where I would walk up Mass Ave to my orthodontist's office to do nothing less than take off my braces. "Hoorah!" I thought as I walked there, "I'm finally getting my braces off! It's all done. Go ME!" I arrive there like 5 or 10 minutes early but they take me and they do their whole thing, which was painless for the most part except for when they needed to pull the bands around the molars off because my teeth weren't cooperating with them and their tool wasn't cooperating with the band so it hurt a bit, but it wasn't too excruciating. After I got 'em off, they took impressions, my picture, and some x-rays, which all went smoothly.  I have to say though, I'm not sure that I don't prefer having braces. I never realized how big my teeth were until they took 'em off and I looked in the mirror and saw: BAM! BIG WHITE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT TEETH! and it was shocking because for two and a half years I saw metal brackets and arch-wire over these big white chompers. Anyway, I don't exactly feel comfortable smiling anymore and it bothers me, but I think I'll get used to it pretty quickly. I get used to everything pretty quickly. I remember when I first got my braces on, I had no inhibition about smiling with them. It's not that I was proud or anything of them, but I didn't see anything wrong or "ugly" about them. I thought they were kind of cool and added to my whole personality. I guess I, in a way, became the braces... or did the braces become me? I don't know, but the point is that I just... I just... I miss my braces! :'(  I'll have a picture of me without braces up as soon as I can take one, though.  Anyway, after I got 'em all off, I took the T over to my dad's work and showed him and he was all like "wow, great. that's great. I'm happy for you." and then I explained my predicament and he was like "pffft!!" so whatever. I went home after that and played the campaign from Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne because I only just got an illegal copy of it from Ali because I really don't like paying someone to waste my time. It's not a bad game, but it's not terribly great either, but I think I'll just go through it and beat it like everything else. While playing, I got a call from my dad inviting me to dinner with him and Erik. We went to Pinnochio's or however the fuck you spell it and ordered the same thing as ever, I got a cheesesteak thing, my dad and erik each got two slices of tomato basil pizza, Sicilian style or whatever they call it. It was, as always, good. We walked around Harvard Square... AGAIN, but this time got ice cream at Toscanini's. I hadn't had it in a really long time, but when I had it tonight, I was reminded why I love the place so much. The ice cream fucking rocks.  Then we came home and I wrote this post. On the way home though, before I end this thing, I heard this very "enriching" conversation between like 6 high school students. It was quite possibly the best show of intelligence that I've seen in a long time. I mean, these wise folk are our best and brightest.   This one is not --> I think that if and when the reinstate the draft, they shouldn't try and make the polling more even. They should pull the lazy moronic fucks like the ones I heard on the bus and make them get their acts together. I mean, if they can't think, at least give them a gun to kill people that my elected officials think are dangerous. God, just don't pollute the american air with your retarded scat about beating the shit outta some motherfucker who borrowed a box of fucking tic-tacs. America is doomed by it's political correctness. We need to stop being so politically correct and start saying things for what they are. Not all high school students are stupid, but the majority of the ones that I see don't have the mental capacity to think about a single issue more complex than whether or not to dump their current significant other or something ridiculous like that. And YET, "in an effort to make the army a more diverse pool" (or something along those lines) the US Govt. is actually gonna take people with a brain and hopes and dreams and opportunities and send them off? FUCK THAT! I'm dodging any fucking draft that comes my way because I know I'm better than some nameless soldier on the field, however heroic his actions may be. I'd much rather send the douche at the back of the bus because he probably isn't gonna be as much service to the US in the long run just talking and thinking about what he is now, so yeah. I think that just about sums it up. I'm sorry if I repeated anything, but I'm too tired/lazy to check and fix it.  That is all. -- Feanor

      This is the fourth installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  January 29th, 2004  An Ideal Morning  :-D... Finally.  This was a good morning. It's about time I had one of these. Perhaps I'll actually go out today without being forced. I love it when things like this happen. May the light of Illúvatar continue to guide me. 	>> meowMix  January 29th, 2004  When good days go bad!  How my good morning progressed...  Well, today didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. 6 hours went buy and i didn't get anything done except consume over 2300 calories and win 8 games of LA.  I'm gonna swear an oath to myself, and MARK MY WOR-R-R-S -- emm... there's no need, I forgot. They're already marked here so here's the oath. I swear to not play more than 22 minutes and 44 seconds of SC a day. :-P  But like most oaths that I swear to myself I will probably break it... :-\ I feel kinda doomed to this addiction. >> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'.

      This post was meant to be posted at around 1:09AM on July 16, 2004, but due to technical difficulties, it was postponed.   Mmmmm... Generic.  Just a warning to everyone, ya know, just to let everyone know before they read, this was mostly an uneventful day with. So, today starts off like every other day. I wake up, I go to the computer, I walk around, I get tired quickly from too little sleep, I go back to sleep, I wake up again, I look in the mirror, do my daily hygiene, go back to the computer, do some stuff on it including learn C, pick up the guitar, play a little, listen to some music on the stereo, pack up the house some more. Ya know, all the same stuff I've been talking about since I've gotten to Boston. To be honest, it completely lame. I've been looking for the cheapest PC that I can find that I will be able to keep for a couple years for programming applications and the like. So far I've come to the conclusion that Compaq is my best option, but I'll keep up the search and look for an even better price than 950 bucks for the system I configured.  I  also  went out to coffee with my dad to meet with someone. His name is Ali, but this is a different one from the one I've been talking about before. They talked about stuff and I listened and occasionally threw some thought in there. The conversation somehow managed to move from science education to world affairs and we started talking about the chinese and indian economies and outsourcing and the like and I think I've realized what's been bugging me so much about China. As much as I want to kill the whole fucking place, I can't because they have that stupid nuke. Anyway, I don't  really  want to kill them all, I just want them to be powerless... and even that I don't  really  want. Whatever, that doesn't matter. In my ever-lasting quest to find out more about me and what makes me work and get mad or sad or upset or happy or whatever about certain things, I decided to think about what was really making me so upset about China and I came to the following conclusion.  I feel uncomfortable with China's growth because it would not be possible without the sheer number of people that they have populating their nation. It's like 1.5 BILLION vs 350 million, it's not exactly the same ball game. Anyway, the chinese government doesn't believe in human rights it seems so whenever they need people to work, they force them to and don't give them all the little niceties such as a bathroom break or a decent wage. And if there's a riot, they just kill them all because they know they have more people to do their stupid labor work. On the other hand, you have a nation like US who believes in human rights (at least for themselves) and supports a healthy work environment and better productivity per capita, but might not be able to compete just because of sheer mass of China. What makes the whole situation worse is that I feel like China is just using its complete disrespect for the human condition to further its growth. It just bothers me. I really wish that I was like some kind of ultra-powerful dictator who could just assassinate the whole chinese government and put my own nice one in. The world be a better place, man. Vote Feanor for president.  Ok, so after that little discussion/meeting thing, my dad and I came home and ate dinner. We didn't eat anything much because both of us were too tired to cook so we just pulled out some of those microwave dinner things from the freezer, heated those up, and ate those. While I was eating, I looked up some more computers that reinforced my thoughts about the compaq and the Doom III beta image that I've been trying to send my cousin, Peter, finally finished after two days. I hate his stupid 28.8k. Anyway, I think that just about covers it because I had just finished my little dish thing when I started this and... yeah. That covers it alright.  That is all. -- Feanor

      This is the third installment of the 'Blast From The Past' series in which I take the old posts that I've found from a previous blog and post them here.  I figured I should do this before I get really tired tonight and think of it as more of a chore than something I  want  to do, which it isn't. That was kind of confusing. I want to do it, but I don't want it to feel like a chore and I know it will when I'm really tired tonight. Anyway, these're the next two posts that I wrote as far as I could tell.  January 28th, 2004  With days like these who needs days?  Status and reflection on the past few days  As I said in It was Cloudy I haven't left the house consistently for a little more than a few days in a row and it's really starting to get to me. It's bed-time now and I'm listening to The Postal Service as usual, which doesn't have a saddening effect on me, but for some reason I feel depressed now and I think I need to get out more...  I think that when ones hygiene and mental state are at risk, one should go out and it doesn't matter where. Perhaps I'll do that tomorrow, but knowing me, It won't happen until someone drags me out of this place by the ears. So what will most likely happen is I will end up being further depressed and end up looking, feeling, and acting like shit when the time for volunteer orientation at UCLA comes around.  I'm gonna hope for the best and try not to let the bright blue glow of the LCD in a dark room get to me. 	>> meowMix   January 28th, 2004  Do you see me going around saying...  The womens' "poor me", "we're gonna rise up against the men attitude" and how I'm sick of it.  Here I am sitting at my TiBook curious if I got anything in the mail so I unassumingly start up Mail and what do I find but an e-mail from my father's aunt talking about how women rising to power is freakin' us men out and making us scared. I've had a problem with messages like this nearly forever but before I get labeled as a chauvinist please hear me out.  While I can't speak for all men, I feel that I can safely say for myself that I am glad that women are having a more prominent role in society than they previously had and I admit that past society has been oppressive to their gender. However, I do NOT appreciate it when people, women or men who feel that they have to somehow over-compensate for the actions of the generations before them by writing articles saying that women are somehow better than men or that the majority of men have some big, demonic plan to control them and make sure they can't do anything more than wash the dishes and raise the kids.  I take no responsibility for the actions of the generations before me and I don't think that others should either. It is for this reason, among others, that I get offended by the descendants of holocaust survivors suing companies that helped the nazis for their actions over 50 years ago, or worse, suing companies that didn't even exist at the time.  Anyway, the point I mean to make is that I'm sick of people acting like I have some big evil plan to keep women down because of my own insecurities. And if I ever say or even hint at the fact that the world is becoming emasculated then I must somehow be a primitive cave-man chauvinist who thinks women should sweep all day. The fact of the matter is that I hope that women and men can be on the same field and there not be any animosity on either side. I mean, you don't see me going around saying that men are great all the time for 'x' and 'y' reason.  All that I ask is that the whole "feminist" movement shut their traps for a bit and think about how current generations feel towards women, rather than looking back 4k years and pointing their fingers excitedly as if to make a point about the modern world. Please, grow up, look at your current situation, think of ways to improve the future, and (PLEASE) don't mourn over the past. 	>> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  Well, I think that just about covers the purpose of this post. If there was anything that bugs you about either of the posts, good for you. This was me about 5 or 6 months ago and I change a lot fast and often, so just keep that in mind. I will write another tonight about today that might contain some kind of reflection. These things often do.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Well, today went picked up the C book that Ali gave me and started going through it. I was always told that C was an ugly language to learn, but I think it's quite possibly the best language I've ever seen. It's so succinct, so tight, so efficient, so beautiful that it inspires me to get in the guts of my computer and make it MY slave. I haven't felt this excited about coding since I first picked up a Java book. Wow.  While, I was doing this, since I had made a plan to rip all the CDs that I hadn't yet, I was doing that in between the little exercises. Doing this reminded me how much music I bought and how much of it I thought was cool and still think is cool years after I bought it, like Bob Dylan and The Police.  So, yeah, I also talked to a few people over AIM while doing these other things and it was fun :-). I ate like 6 of those "Chewy" brand Quaker granola bars that are loaded with sugar and the like. They're surprisingly addictive, despite the canker-sore that I've developed that gets irritated more and more with every bite. I feel really dumb eating them, but man, they're just so tasty and right next to the computer. Don't blame me, dammit!  Moving on, after most of my nice day had passed, it was about 7:10 when I found out that my dad and Ali were gonna have another meeting, so naturally I tagged along and listened. Business meetings are fun to listen to, in my opinion anyway. We at this mexican place in Harvard Square called Border Cafe. It's pretty good. After dinner, we walked around and got some tea from another place in Harvard Square called Tealuxe. It's a great place with an amazingly large selection of tea and a great aroma. It's also got a free wireless connection for customers, which is cool because you could do almost anything with a good laptop and the internet :-). Ali and I didn't get anything, but my dad got a cup of the tea of the day.  So, after my dad got his tea, we hung around outside the door and talked about stuff and the conversation evolved into one of my future. I really like these talks because they give me a little kick and a reason to wake up in the morning. Anyway, I now know what I need to do, not that I didn't before, but it helped to hear it all again to get into a good college. I know, I keep flip-flopping around, but I think that I should take advantage of the cerebral frontal cortex that god's given me and besides, being an engineer doesn't mean I can't be a guitarist and be in a band too. It just means that I'll be one busy motherfucker. Anyway, often during these discussions I phase out and think about what I want to because I've heard most of it already, so when it starts to get uninteresting, I tune out, nod regularly and mutter uh huh's every now and again for a short while as I squeeze in my own thought. Getting back on track, during this time, I remembered that over the course of one of these similar talks, telling my dad and Chris (a.k.a. Scooby) that "I don't do plans" when they suggested I draw out a strategy, and both of them just essentially walking off and calling me stupid for thinking that. I just thought that was kinda funny how I was so dumb back then and how I've kind of matured a bit. I need to make a plan for the next year of my life to get into MIT and just get the entry process done and over with. Thanks, ol' Pops and Ali for the help, not that either of you read this, but whatever.  Oh, right, I almost forgot about the old posts that I was gonna throw in to these daily ones. I've decided that I'll just do my best to figure out what was written when and just stick in two a day. Anyway, these're the next two posts I wrote:  January 27th of 2004  The Ever-Growing, Ever-Irritating Growths  The Gory Detail of My Toenails  I clipped my toenails today after waiting for over two months and I accidentally cut a little, tiny, incy-wincy bit of my big toe off with the clippers and it bled forever. I also had a lot to clean up when I was done. Well, ya know what they say, "People in glass houses sink ships". Naw, but seriously, "St. Peter loves and has never turned down a well-groomed, short-toenailed businessman."         >> meowMix  January 28th of 2004  It was cloudy  Feelin' lonely and lazy  Today was a cloudy day and I've been lonely. I haven't left the house consistently for over a week and it's been getting to me. I sit at home and play SC, sometimes do some math, or pick up an old Political Science book, or on some days like today, fixing an iPod. I don't know what has been up lately. I just seem to have lost all motivation to do anything other than eat and laze around the house, but what's odd is that I don't really like doing that.  Perhaps what's causing this is my moving to the massive city that is LA. When I lived back in Boston I could just take a bus and a train and my two legs to anywhere I wanted, but in LA, while I may be able to take a bus or 4 to nearly anywhere I would WANT to go, it's not pleasant to walk from bus-stop to bus-stop, nor am I particularly fond of the looks I get when riding on the busses around here. Another thing may be that there's not much to do in this city without 40 bucks in your pocket... and I don't have 40 bucks. In Boston I still didn't have 40 bucks lying around but there was almost always a bookstore within a mile or two from where you were standing, and since the place is filled with students, there is always a pleasant place to eat for under 5 bucks. Perhaps it's just what I see when I walk around... Everyone drives a $45k car and wears fancy clothes, but doesn't care in the slightest about what's happening outside their circle of friends.  Aw hell, maybe I'm all wrong about why I'm not going outside but I don't know what's up with me and I don't like it. This place doesn't feel like home and I'm not sure how long it will take before it will :-\.         >>meowMix  Well, I'm not even gonna bother explaining these things. You can figure it out yourself for the most part I think. I'm kinda tired from today anyway.  That is all. -- Feanor

      So I was doin' my usual thing today when I decided that I should go outside and play in the rain, or at least walk in it or something. I really enjoy the rain. We never really get any rain out in CA and when we do, it's crappy rain. It's not any fun to stand in and tastes funny. Anyway, I wrote Ali and asked him if he wanted to go out and eat something or drink something or get a Jamba Juice or just hang out or whatever and he said sure. But then I realized I needed to take a shower and get ready because well, why would one take a shower and get ready if all they're gonna do is sit and home, eat, play guitar, program a bit, chat, and read all day? Anyway, I needed to take a shower and make myself presentable to the world so after much avoiding the shower, I finally got in and started the whole process of shampoo, body wash and bla bla bla. But then it hit me while I was wetting my hair before I put the shampoo in, "Too much time gets wasted in the shower. Most people take 10 toe 15 minute showers. I think that if I could shorten this time by even the littlest bit, we could make the US a more productive place." And so in an effort to save time in the shower, I tried to do multiple things at once. I took the shampoo and put it in my hair and massaged into the scalp and all that good stuff and then I got the body wash and tried to apply it at the same time as I rinsed the shampoo out of my hair. It turns out that this is 1) really hard, 2) it doesn't really save much time, and 3) hurts a lot. I ended up not being able to see where I was putting the body wash and accidentally opened my eyes while I was rinsing the shampoo out so all the shampoo got in my eyes and, being the quick-thinking individual I am, tried to rub the shampoo out with my hands, which happened to be at the time, still covered in body wash. So, in conclusion, not only did I not save a lot of time, but I made a lot of noise, and irritated my eyes to the point of staying red for 30 minutes after. I do not recommend using this technique.  Anyway, I got out of the shower and got dressed, but then remembered that I had to empty out the entertainment center for Andrew and Anandita (sp?) so that they could use it after we left. But I had to do this all before I left to see Ali because I needed it done before my dad got back which, while I knew would be late, I knew that I would not be home long before he was (we actually came home together after I met with Ali). Ok, so there I am being all quick'a'like takin' all the CD's outta the drawers when I realize "damn, most of these CDs are mine... and I've got over 300 of 'em. That's kind of a lot, when you think about it considering that I bought most of them at 15 to 20 bucks, which means that I've spent over... 4500 bucks on music. The RIAA must love me... but then again, they must hate me too because I'm a pirate. YARR!"  It's kind of interesting to me that the RIAA got all bent out of shape over pirates and then started going after small-time people like me. I mean, really, who are they to come to me for stealing one crappy pop song after I've bought probably over 5000 dollars of music. I mean, god, some things just really bug me about America, but when I think about it, I think "at least I'm not worrying that someone will bomb me because at least the US government, while not fixing a lot of stuff at home, has been busy spending my parents tax dollars to kick everyone else's ass. I am damn lucky to be an American, not necessarily proud, but damn lucky." I believe in the old, classic American values, but I'll be damned if someone called me proud to be an American if it's associated with killing small children with million dollar missiles and calling it the american dream, the american way, or the true expression of american values. I love my country, but damn, it's gotta clean up it's act a bit. Maybe if we stop fucking with people, they'll stop trying to fuck with us. I dunno, that's just my theory.  Moving on, I went to MIT and met up with Ali and we were going to go to Jamba Juice, so we walked over to Boston, which is about a 20 to 30 minute walk, but the queerbees over there decided that they were gonna renovate or something so it was closed. Since we were in Boston, we decided that it would be a good idea to get something to eat so we went to the Prudential Center (a mall) and were uninspired by the selection, except for a Krispy Kreme, to which we both went and got donuts. I really don't think Krispy Kreme is really all that good especially for the price. I mean, the actual donut itself in terms of the dough is debatably better, but they've got nothing on the cream or chocolate of Dunkin' Donuts, and since my favorite donuts are the ones with either chocolate frosting, cream filling, or both, I really would much rather go to Dunkin' Donuts. Also, not only is Krispy Kreme's not as tasty as Dunkin' Donuts, but it costs more; A single donut at Dunkin' Donuts is like 65 cents, if I'm not mistaken, while a single donut at Krispy Kreme's is 90 cents. I dunno, the whole thing just bothers me because I think Dunkin' Donuts is better than Krispy Kreme's, but everyone else that I talk to says Krispy Kreme's is much better. And I guess eventually, if everyone feels the same way that the people I've talked to feel, Dunkin' Donuts will be forced to go outta business and I won't have anywhere to go for great coffee and breakfast sandwiches in the middle of the day. Sigh. I guess that's one of the problems with open markets, capitalism, and democracy.  Getting back to what I was doing today, after blowing three bucks on donuts and being disappointed, Ali and I went over to this greek place on Newbury St., which is a cute street with a bunch of shops and places to eat on it. It's a tourist attraction and it feels a lot like Europe... minus the funny accent the words you don't understand. Anyway, we went to this greek place called Steve's. It wasn't bad, and in fact was kinda good, but a bit hefty in terms of the price. After that, we went to Trader Joe's which was about a block away, if that and looked around for a bit. We didn't buy anything though. Then Ali and I went back to his dorm and hung out and talked about the OS he's writing, TV shows, computer games, and some other chit-chattery type'a'things. After that my day was pretty much over because I ran over to the Media Lab, met up with my dad, caught the train, caught the bus home, talked to people online, and wrote this post.  My life is good. I am privileged and I am acknowledging it here. Thank you, supreme being and all others who've allowed me to live, be, feel, and all that good stuff this way.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I can't help but smile whenever I go to catch the bus because of the way the intersection is set up. The intersection nearest my house also happens to be one of the intersections at which the bus stops, which is nice because it means that I only have to walk about 300 feet from my door to catch the bus. However, the pedestrian crossing button thing is set up at that intersection, like most of the boston stop lights, pedestrian-centrically. It works such that if any one person hits the buttom to cross from any "corner"(sometimes there are more than two streets running through the intersection and sometimes it's not perfectly perpendicular and you end up with 5 places to stand, and just stuff like that.) of the intersection, it turns ALL the lights for the cars red and ALL of the lights for pedestrians to walk. This wouldn't be so bad though if the intersection near where I lived didn't have such high traffic. Whenever I need to cross the street, I end up stopping all the traffic and creating a long line of cars and everyone looks at ME so it feels really awkward. Anyway, I feel this urge to smile I guess because I feel kinda bad for stopping everyone and I'm embarrassed by my own arrogance... Even though it's not really  my  arrogance, it just feels that way. Anyway, I have nothing more to say and I feel now like I've wasted people's time... Yet again :-\.  That is all. -- Feanor

      NOTE: As the CPD tag indicates, this is not a new post. It was originally posted on Unpasteurized on July 13th, 2004 at 14:14 EST, but has been duplicated and posted here for your convenience.  I bet he comes on sometimes and just reads 'em for kicks. Not that his omniscient self doesn't know what he's reading before he "sees" (with his entirely intangible being) the word, but he might, like, focus on it and just laugh. Then again, how would an intangible being do something like laugh? Isn't laughter something that is by definition a certain physical expression of a certain emotion? Maybe Jesus laughs (as opposed to the father or the holy spirit) o.O, but that's only plausible if you believe in that whole holy trinity thing. Even if he couldn't express his "feelings", that doesn't necessarily mean that he can't be aware of it. I confused myself and forgot my point... again. Fuck.   That is all.  -- Feanor

      So it seems that I forgot to look at the post dates of my old blog and because of this, I didn't notice that the computer thinks that I wrote the bulk of my posts on January 28th. This isn't accurate though because it was based on my system clock and that was busted for some reason that I've forgotten. Anyway, since I don't know when I posted what, I'll just spam you guys with all of the posts of a day in one post here in the best order that I can guess it was written. The format was also a little different on the old blog. I had a title, an abstract, and a body, so I'll write them in that order on separate lines following the date. It was also pointed out to me after showing my cousin the post that I wrote initially, that it cuts out the stuff between the --'s on PCs so the sig marker for my old posts will be changed to >>.   January 26, 2004  Who am I?:  Who is writing what you're reading?   I am a 16 year old male from Massachusetts who just moved back to his birth-state of California after 7 years of being in MA. My name is •••• • •••••• but I prefer meowMix and theGerm in the online realm. I am of mixed blood but I am half persian, a quarter chinese and the rest is a mix of German, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish. I am part of a family of 4 with two parents and a sister, but I have a HUGE extended family. I am addicted to StarCraft but I'm not amazing at it.  I use macs primarily and would under very rare circumstances put my money down on a Windows PC. I like electronic music (but not techno) of all types, most of rock, and some pop. And for those of you who get into that new age bigotry also known as Astrology, I was born on 11/24/87 in the Roman Catholic Calendar at 5:20 Pacific Standard Time in Martinez California.  I imagine you'll find out more about me as you read this growing blog... 	>>meowMix  There ya go. For some reason, I felt that I should introduce myself to no one. Just some updates though, since Shannon really picked up on that name, meowMix, as a real life nickname, I never use it for anything anymore except my AIM name which I am stuck with people a lot of my friends are retarded and would be confused if I got a new name. Now, if you're curious as to why I don't use it, it's just because it brings back sweet and sour memories; kinda like that chinese sauce stuff, but not so tasty and more like something that would trigger vomiting. Another note, I'm no longer addicted to StarCraft and right before I quit, I did become awesome at it, so just keep that in mind if you want to challenge me to a UMS game.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Ok, so today I was eating a bowl of soup and I was thinking about random things, as I usually do while I eat. There are a few funny stories where this characteristic expresses itself at all the wrong times in public places, but there's no point in telling any of them here; besides, I've forgotten the bulk of most of them. Anyway, of the few things I thought about, one was that movie 'Good Will Hunting'. I remembered in one part Robin Williams is asking Matt Damon something to the effect of whether he's met anyone who truly challenges him or something, like a partner who's like the dudette to match all his dudeness... or something like that. That's at least how it stuck in my head.  In any event, I started thinking "hey, have  I  met anyone that challenges me in that true sense?" and then I thought for a while, as I slowly ate the clam chowder that was prepared far too hot. Finally, I came to the conclusion that the most challenging people for me to deal with are smartasses. I was then depressed by my recognition of my own simplicity because even after further thinking, the only thing that I could think of that really made me want to be better was... well, nothing except being a smarter ass than the smartass that just bested me. Perhaps it's just a phase, but if this is true (that I only need a smarter ass than me to become a better person and grow and bla bla bla), then my life is pretty damn easy in terms of finding a wife that I'll be happy with. So far it looks like these are the requirements (in no particular order):  Good Looking Intelligent Aware of general events in the world Less lazy than me Wants to have more than 2 kids (but not too many more) Doesn't mind animals Doesn't hate outdoors and finally, a smartass  When I look at that list, I think "damn, feanor, you sure you're not more picky? I mean, really, this list is really general and you must be kinda desperate to come up with such a list and then post it." and then I reply to myself "naw, I'm just a simple dude who doesn't ask for much." Then I say to myself "i.e. desperate, buddy. go and get a life, dude." to which I reply "*wimpers* *cries* *runs away* *stays gone of like 45 seconds* *comes running back screaming with a big kitchen knife and stabs the other character to death* *grins* *walks off as if nothing happened at all*." That's a pretty active imagination if I say so myself. It's creepin' me out!  Anyway, I don't even know why I wrote this thing or if it even portrays what's actually happening in my head, or if it even makes sense within it's own context, but thanks for reading it anyway.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I was recently looking through my computer for old files that have accumulated and I stumbled upon my old blog from January and February. I didn't post it in a public domain, but I still wrote it and it was on the net... just really well hidden. Anyway, I was reading them and I thought that it would be cool to post them in chronological order. There are a total of 15 posts, so I think what I'll do is post my first old post first and two a day after that for the following week.  When I read them, it was a very interesting experience. It was like I was brought back to the time when I was writing it. It seems that I remember it so vividly that when I reread them, I had all the feelings that I had  while  writing it. It was like I was kinda taken back in time in my head. I don't know if that's entirely common, but it was the strangest sensation I've ever had.  Ah yes, that reminds me, when I was going through my old files, I also stumbled upon a picture of last year's* halloween costume. I made it out of cardboard, black (main body) and silver (letters) spray paint, aluminum foil (pins), theater tape, and a 20,000 dollar laser-cutter (used to cut out the letters, pins, the pin 1 indicator (inset circle) in the top left corner and the semi-circle thing cut into the top of the chip to help further show which is pin 1) at my dad's work. Total cost of materials sans laser-cutter: ~30 bucks. I still have it. It's sitting in one of my closets in LA. The picture of me isn't very good, but it's the best one that I have (there were three taken, of which this is the best). I wore it out of the airport when I landed in LA with it and I got cheers and laughs. People wanted to take pictures with me wearing it. It was awesome. Anyway, the picture:   urlLink     Click to Enlarge   And so, in conclusion, my first post will be put up here tomorrow and then we shall just go from there.  That is all. -- Feanor  * 2003

      This picture was just way too cool for me to pass up showing everyone. It's a real picture released by NASA from the last shuttle mission taken on one of the extremely rare days where there aren't any clouds. The sun is setting and you can see that in western Europe, it's still light out, but in central and eastern, it's night time. The lights in Paris are on anyway, however. I was really taken back when I saw it. I thought it wasn't real, but whatever. Enjoy.   urlLink     Click to Enlarge   That is all. -- Feanor

      As the title suggests, I'm tired, so I don't think I'll be posting anything tonight, but I swear I'll post about what happened today tomorrow, so yeah. Just gimme some time to sleep and stuff and I'll be back to my excessively posting self :-).  I feel kinda guilty though for troubling people to come and then not posting at least a little something. And I mean, yeah, sure, I didn't ask anyone to specifically come and check this blog out, but still, if people are gonna come, I feel I should do something for them, kinda like how my irish friend would sometimes drive into Watertown from Allston and just stop by for tea and crackers or something like that. I didn't invite him or anything, but it was always great to see him and talk to him so the cost of the tea and my expensive crackers that he'd munch like one would saltines with clam chowder. It was worth all the trouble though, even when I didn't want to go through it. And come to think of it, this analogy's a pretty loose fit, but I like the story so I'll leave it here.  Moving on, I bought a couple Dire Straits albums and a couple singles from the iTunes Music Store and I've been listening to them all day. I particularly like  urlLink Sultans Of Swing . I just think that the guitar in that song is so awesome and I could just sit and listen to the couple solos in there and try to practice them all day. It's just so cool to me how someone can do that. I want to do that.  Moving on, I'm feeling a little better now so I think I'll just write a full post about my day. After buying the songs, I got to my hard work of practicing guitar, reading the news, checking my buddy list, reading assorted blogs, and the like. Meanwhile, my dad was moving shit up and down from the attic all day until he got to the tables, which he needed help with. In the process of moving them up the stairs to the attic, we managed to break a window that I ended up picking up the glass to. I didn't get cut or anything though, which is really good because I hate sucking wounds for hours on end.  Anyway, after that brief period of strenuous exercise, I went back to my extremely busy work schedule and listened to more Dire Straits and read more news, read more blogs, wrote a couple posts, played some more guitar, and talked online. After doing all this extremely hard work, I decided that it was a good a time as any to finish up my work for one of the recommendation letters I'm getting from UCLA so I whipped out the CDs that I brought from LA and put the proper one into the drive, copied over the files and was working until about 45 minutes ago. Over the time I was working, Erik came over and he and my dad discussed more business. My dad just left to take Erik back to his place about 20 minutes ago and I've been looping Sultans Of Swing since around 9PM and I'm still not sick of it. I imagine my dad will get back pretty soon, and I think that just about covers everything anyway.  My thoughts of the day were pretty bla, but I did solidify a few things in my mind. I'm going to find and get a job using the skills that I've accumulated over the years in my effort to get into MIT to make some money so that I can afford my expensive life-style. I think this'll be really good for me, and my dad supports it. He's been through A LOT, so I trust him with a lot in terms of my choices in life. I trust him because he's a genuine guy who would never lie to me when it mattered. Not that he reads this, but I want to thank him for being there when he was, despite all his shortcomings because without him, I can't imagine where I'd be now.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I feel like I really shouldn't post the following picture because I hadn't shaved for a few days and I stopped believing in haircuts (until it gets unmanageable) and it shows, but I'll post it anyway because I think it's funny. I also feel some strange compulsion to post a picture of myself for no good reason. I think it looks like a smily mugshot... of someone with enough money to buy half-decent clothes.

      Ya know, I felt this when I first got off the plane to Boston and stepped out to breathe the air of my home city, but I've just been too forgetful/lazy to post about it.  It felt different this time when I arrived in Boston from Los Angeles. I didn't get the same rush as I had so many times before. At first I was confused as to why that familiar feeling wasn't there, but when taking a walk through Harvard Square with my dad, it dawned on me. My family's situation is very different now. Even though my dad might still get 1 or 2 more paycheck from The Media Lab, he doesn't hold the same position that he did. He's now only a visiting research scientist, where before he was an assistant research scientist (better). Then it all came down on me at once and I felt this cold feeling run through me, I don't feel quite so much at home in Boston anymore because my dad doesn't have his standing at MIT anymore. While I wasn't consciously aware of it, I seemed to 'know' that things were different now and I could feel it in me. For the first time in my life, I felt illegitimate. I felt like I was walking in place that didn't belong to me. It was one of the worst feelings of my life.  I told my dad about it and he said "You finally get it. Your bloodline matters. I worked my ass off so that you could be here and get things like this. You finally get it that your standing in the city has to do with your family members." "But I knew that already" I replied, to which he responded "Yes, but you feel it now. It's clicked for you and you can feel it. I love you. I still have a standing here in Cambridge though, and regardless, this place will always be your home, whether I have a place here or not. You grew up here so it's yours. Besides, I still have a number of connections at the lab to have no worries, boy." That was comforting.  In conclusion, while it was exceedingly disturbing to feel illegitimate, I somehow knew that I would always have a right to the place regardless of my dad, but it just seemed to make me feel better to let it out and get some feedback. Interesting.  Now, not that anyone cares about semi-random things like this, but I do... and it's my blog if I remember correctly so I'll post what I want here, thank you very much.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Just a note, but the title refers, not to the bulk of the post, but the part of the post that is most significant to me, personally. Anyway, the post...  This morning I had to wake up early so that we could get an early start on canoeing for Anandita's b-day celebration. Her birthday's on like the 14th, but no one was in town, including Anandita to celebrate it then, so we did it today. Anyway, we got up at like 8:00 and left the house at 8:50 (10 minutes late) to get their house by 9:00 so that we could drive up to Ipswitch (~45 minutes) to get there by around 10. It's all very precise, you see. Anyway, we went up and got all set up, and managed to squeeze 18 people into a 14 passenger van, set up the canoes and were in the water by 11. It took a couple hours to get used to the canoe because my dad and I had only gone once before and it was a while ago, probably about 3 or 4 years and even then we weren't very good.  Regardless, after an hour or two we were getting better, but it was almost unanimous that we traveled over 3 times as much distance as everyone else because while they went in a straight line, we zig-zagged across the river at almost 80 degree angles. My dad didn't know how to steer, but really wanted to learn, so I'd let him try, but whenever he'd try and i'd let him go, I'd either almost die from the blunt end of a fat tree branch hitting my face, or almost capsizing, or just run into a bed of those water flower things. It was all very fun and I am now sore.  They also had some hella mean/big bugs out there. One of them, I think it's called a deerfly bit a whole in my leg and it started bleeding and wouldn't stop for like half an hour, and it friggin' hurt too. Felt like someone used a wire-cutter on a tiny piece of skin on my calve. Owie. We were also the only boat to have flipped over entirely. We both managed to kill our cell phones, but hopefully they will dry out and be fine. We canoed from around 11AM to like 3:45PM, a very exhausting exercise.. All in all, a good time canoeing despite my dad's inability to steer, muscle soreness, and dead cell phones.  But the fun didn't end there. After canoeing we went to the beach, Crane's Beach and ate some lunch, got some tans, got sand in my shoes, and swam in the ocean. The weather has been really, absurdly nice out in Eastern Mass so the beach air wasn't too hot, the sand wasn't too hot, nor the water too cold. 5 of us went into the water and swam, talked about stuff (like american politics and how australians are wild adventurers), and I managed to lose my rubber bands for my braces. So... after this, we sung happy birthday and ate some cake and met an old friend from the Media Lab and left back for Cambridge.  When we got back to Cambridge to pick up our car, we (my dad and I, well, my dad) drove home and we took showers and tried to get the stuff from the beach and river out of our hair. It seems that the stuff in the river is pretty hardcore stuff that shampoo is too gentle to break up/clean out of one's hair. My dad tried scrubbing it out like three times and it still wouldn't come out so I suggested using the body wash, and guess what? It came out. Funny stuff, that river gunk; it turned my beige A&F baggy short things with lots of big pockets yellow.  After getting ourselves cleaned up, and listening to some music, we got ready to leave for Harvard Square. We found some parking shortly after we got there (a godsend, and anyone who's looked for parking in Cambridge knows this) and went to Finalé. Finalé's this dessert place that's really nice and highly sexy and tasty and glorious. We ran into our neighbor Sara and her family on the way and conversed with them briefly before continuing on our way.    This is the most interesting part to me   When we got there, we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table so we hung around inside the little place talking about various small random things like the relationship status of Sara (provided upon request. It's not like I just divulge this information for no reason. Jeez, gimme some credit here.) and I "flirted", as my dad's uncle and cousin would call it, with the girl who asked for our party name by complimenting her on her Brass Rat*. I only make reference to that because they hassled me once for complimenting this girl who was wearing this way-more-than-awesome pocket protector, I just couldn't resist.  Anyway, we sit down and he asks me what's on my mind so I tell him and he, being the really helpful dude he is. Yes, I call my dad "dude". I even call him dude in conversation, sometimes I'll be all like "hey, uh, dude, watch where you're goin'" or "Uh, hey, dude, can you get me that?" and he'll be totally cool about it. Getting back on track, he asks me how I was doing and I said that I was really confused about my life situation and I needed some help (Really, what else is dad for?... aside from the occasional 'loan').  So he asked me what exactly was up and I explained about how I have this fear of failure, and how I feel that I have to get into MIT or Harvard or CalTech or Stanford or Berkeley or any prestigious university of college, and how I hate having to worry about money to the extent that I do** and that I want to be financially independent of the rest of the family unit. So he asks me about detail and I say that I want to get a job because I need the money to buy things like music, bus fare, food, an electric guitar, an amp, things like that, but I feel that I can't get a job because every single thing that's been said to me says "It's a bad idea for your future to get a job in high school because it takes time away from other things you should be doing." Being the trusting dude (who also happens to be afraid of failure) I am, I decide to hardwire into my brain that it's a bad idea to get a job because it interferes with this bigger goal that you have of getting into a prestigious university because you're one of the best, so you deserve one of the best and if you don't go to one of the best, you're a waste. Now, my dad never said these things, but that's the impression that I got whenever I had talked to him before, so I had this very warped image of what the world and life were all about. Anyway, over the course of the night he convinces me that my world view is inaccurate and has been clouded by a life-long lack of resources, delusional mother (and trust me on this one, she is), and immature father (trust me on this one too, he was/is). And so in the end, he says something along the lines of the following, and I say it not because I think that it will apply to everyone, but I think that if you're confused about what you want to do, but feel pressured into doing something because you've invested time and energy into it, you might find this helpful. And if you want concrete stories about people who're like the ones described below, just AIM me at TheLordMeowMix and I'd be more than happy to tell a story or two (if I'm around. If not, just wait for a few hours... or more. You'll get a response by the end of the day for sure).  Ok, so he said something like this: Living life is about a negotiation*** with your situation in life and what you fundamentally need to live. It's not about following the path that's been laid out for you by others. That path is meant to be a safety net, and for my entire life I've used that safety net. There's nothing wrong with using the safety net depending on what you want from life. If you want to just follow the rules and go to work 9 to 5 and meet with your friends and do the bare minimum for a paycheck, maybe raise a family, that's perfectly fine. However, if you're not sure what you want to do, and your mind is always wondering and you're a curious individual who's into doing whatever is interesting not because other people say it's interesting, but because you think it's interesting and you're passionate, more power to you because, from my experience, that's the path to true happiness. Look around you, he said, siting examples of people I've known over the years who fit the latter description and how they're so happy with themselves and their lives. He said that they were happy, not because they follow the straight path, but because they didn't, again, not that the straight path is bad, but it's only to say that it's not the only way to go. They let their passions guide them and not some already determined path set out for them by their parents and society. And then he ended it on this note: Feanor, do what you want and you will be great as long as you go in full-heartedly. Don't play this game of life to beat others at their game, but rather to beat yourself at your own.  I dunno how interesting that is to anyone else or how that might even apply to anyone else's situation, but it really stayed with me so I figured I should post it. It has made me think and I feel better now because I think that my head's a whole lot clearer now. I'm probably gonna start laying out my skills for myself so that I can know where I can go and apply for a job or two.  I love my father, and that's not a word I throw around lightly for people****.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Class ring for MIT students  ** When I take the bus to work, it's hard to find the fucking buck-25 to use it not because we don't have change lying around, but because we don't have a fucking buck-25. Good lord.  *** Based on an analogy made by a swiss professor comparing the west coast to the east. She said "The way things on the east coast are laid out is a negotiation with the earth about where it's ok to do something, while on the west coast, it's much more like people just came in, tore it all down, poured concrete over it, and put nature where it wanted it." It's a very good analogy when you think about it.  **** I use it on other things, but very, very, rarely for people.

      Ok, so remember how I took those naps yesterday? They threw off today's sleeping schedule. I actually woke up at a reasonable hour, but it felt weird to greet the day at 9:47 AM* so I went back to bed for a couple hours and woke up at the reasonable hour of 11:56 AM. My dad had woken up at like 11 or something though and was really excited about cleaning out the attic and readying the house for Andrew and 'Dita to move in around the 24th, which makes sense to do it now because if we don't, when will we do it? Anyway, he managed to get me out of bed before 12:30, but didn't help at all with the cleaning of the attic because he was busy with some kind of e-mails or something from work. I can't really blame him for not doing helping me though. I mean, his e-mails and the like are paying the bills, so whatever.  While cleaning the attic, I got to organize, count, and estimate the value of all my old macs that I've collected over the years and I now know that I have 7 ADB** keyboard, 6 ADB mice, a big box of wires, two 640x480 resolution old-school mac connector monitors, 2 monochrome monitors, 2 old-school apple 800k 3.25-inch floppy drives, 1 really old-school floppy drives (ya know, the kind where the disk actually flops around. I forgot the proper name of it), a ton of floppies of both sizes, a midi to mac serial converter, 4 scsi hard drives (3 160MB, 1 40MB), and 14 (11 functional) computers. I estimated all of this to be worth close to 750 bucks if I know how to sell it, but unfortunately, I don't know how to sell it so I'll probably get close to nothing for it. At least I had fun playing with 'em and I learned a lot from them about computer diagnostic and repair. Farewell, old mac-ies, FAREWELL! :'(  Moving on, after cleaning the attic for a bit, I went to the old Tangy iMac, let's call him OCiBubble, and did some reading outside of my required humorous and blog bookmark lists. It was surprisingly fun. Then when I read about everything that struck my interest, I saw that no one was online so I started playing guitar. I've almost mastered that hard part of Doin' The Cockroach. Go me!  Hmm, let's see... Oh, and then once I was tired of playing the same thing over and over again, I picked up the book I bought at the beginning of the sumer called "The Simpsons and Philosophy". It's a really funny and high-quality book. Then by the time I was getting tired of that (I'm a very distracted individual who has a hard time focusing on anything for longer than a couple of hours), I called the people at DHL to see if the driver had come back to the station thing with my package. I would have had it, but I slept through the dude knocking on the door this morning at the ungodly early hour of 11:20AM. Jeez, who's even up at that time of the morning?  Anyway, I called and the driver wasn't back yet so I asked my dad for a ride to Best Buy for an adapter to hook my iPod up to the home stereo here and some CD-Rs and he gave me one gladly *mutters* after making me wait for a really long while... but we'll forget about that.   GEEKY JOKE UP AHEAD   NOTE: If you go to Best Buy and don't know exactly where what you want is, make sure you walk in with a TTL (Time To Live) of more than 10 because you'll get rerouted through the store by the employees way more than you'd expect.   THE GEEKY JOKE HAS PASSED   Then when we got home from the pleasant outing, my dad got back to e-mailing and I set up the speakers and iPod and central receiver thing. It's so nice now, I can listen to all my music through the big speakers. It makes me so happy to be able to listen to music on good speakers again. I really don't think I can live without high-fidelity sound. Seriously.  Hmmm... after I made myself happy with music, I picked up the guitar again, and started playing the tune that I've been working on and made close to no progress, but it's ok because I had a good time with it and I learned what not to do when trying to write a song. It's kinda hard for me to explain, so I'll just spare myself the embarrassment by trying to share it here. Then I got sick of playing my little tune and started playing some Modest Mouse songs instead. Of course, I eventually got bored with that and picked up the phone to call DHL again and this time the box was there so I asked my dad for another ride and he granted my request, of course after much waiting. I got the directions from MapQuest, copied them down and we went on our way.  Supposedly, the place we went is in Newton, a neighboring town of Watertown, but for some reason, MapQuest said that we needed to go in a semi-circle to get to our destination through Needham. It was kind of interesting getting lost on the way there. My dad and I always get lost when we try to drive around here, but usually have a pretty easy time getting unlost because the exits are numbered, as opposed to named. The system actually makes a lot of sense once you get used to it and it starts to feel weird to have no idea where something is relative to something else because you can't use the exit as a reference point. I dunno, it's just cool, or maybe I'm just a geek. Anyway, we got lost along the way, but finally got there and I picked up my computer and hugged and kissed the box and we went back home merrily. Just a note, but I really love the highways of the northeast coast. They're surrounded by trees and greenery and keep the artificial materials to a minimum so it just looks orders of magnitude prettier than west coast freeways. Just saying...  On the way home, we stopped off at the store where I got to buy a number of unhealthy, but tasty things because they were on sale. I love sales, but my pancreas, kidneys, and liver don't (poor things). Then we got home and I started up the machine and I was glad to find that they didn't mess with the hard drive and I didn't need to copy all of my data back over. Thank you, Apple for not messing with what you didn't have to, like you sometimes have a tendency to do. After that, not a lot happened. I just made dinner for my dad and I, waited for Erik to come over so we could all meet (I really like meetings), I played some more guitar, ate some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, wrote the post before this one, read a friend's blog based on his request, burned some Modest Mouse CDs for Erik, and now here I am writing this post.  None of my friends are online, which makes me kinda sad, but I'll survive. I've got a guitar, music, TV, math that should be done by now, and the rest of the internet to keep my busy. This modern age is so nice.  Reflection of the moment: I think I'm too smart for my own good because I know myself so well that I can trick myself into thinking that I've done something worthwhile so that I don't feel bad at the end of the days that just go by, but what's worse is that I can rewrite my memories so that what's actually happened is a very hazy blur and what I want to think actually happened is there in place of it. I think I should see a shrink or something. 6 people have told me over the past couple months so far and I think they might have a point there. We will see.  This post was longer than I estimated it to be.  That is all. -- Feanor  * According to the little Sony clock thing by my bed  ** Apple Desktop Bus

        THIS POST WAS WRITTEN ON ME 262-A    Ah, finally my good ol' trusty computer is back and it still has all it's data still on it. Hoorah! It's not like they had to the change the hard drive or that the problem that it had had anything to do with the hard drive, but you never know with those people at the Apple Repair Center thing. Naturally, but unfortunately, they didn't give me a better motherboard than the one that was in it. The problem with the machine was on the video card which is one with the logic board, literally. So, when the video card goes down, the whole logic board needs to be replaced. It's dumb, I know. I'm sure that Apple's heard of modular design, but I guess they have their reasons.  In any event, I have my ol' ME 262-A back from Texas and it's working just fine. I was so happy after getting a ride to Newton (via Needham) to pick it up, that I gave the box a big hug and kiss as soon as the lady at the DHL place passed it over the counter. Grin.  I'll write a post about what's happened today, including the drive to the DHL place, a little later tonight, I think... But for now I'll just stick with this.  Welcome back, ME 262-A.  That is all. -- Feanor

      In an effort to break my habit of writing incredibly long posts, I will try to make this short.  My dad and Erik were going to eat at this burrito place, but it closed when they got there so they went to the mall instead to get something to eat. My dad, being the thoughtful dude that he is, brought me back some Panda Express. Of course, after finishing the meal, I looked for the fortune cookie, found it, ate it and read the fortune as I munched on the cookie. Rarely, anymore is the fortune in the cookie an actual fortune, but rather some comment about what kind of person you are, or something non-fortune-like like that; mine was one of these. Anyway, my cookie read "You are cautious in showing your true self to others." Upon reading this, I denied it as if it were totally absurd and impossible and thought "Pfft! Yeah! Right! Me?! Me not honest about who I am and showing it?! 'HAHAHA! Laughable, man! (In the voice of 'Jesus' from the Big Lebowski)'" Then I thought about it a while longer and realized "Huh, how true it is. I actually am kinda hesitant showing 'what I really am'. I guess it's because I don't have a real 'am'. I'm kinda like a chameleon, I change colors to match my surroundings. In fact, I'm so much like a chameleon that I actually believe that morals are relative so that I don't have as hard a time changing surroundings... I must not like showing that whole picture because I think that people won't accept me because it would be made clear that I'm just a sheep in wolf's clothing -- eeeh, I mean wolf in sheep's clothing... or something like that. Wow, that's one hell of a fortune." Don't get me wrong, though. It's not like I think that god was planning on me seeing this cookie or something. It just happened to kinda fall into my lap and it's just a very odd coincidence.  I wonder if my want -- well, more of a need to fit in is a bad thing?  That is all. -- Feanor

      Today was not nearly as exciting as yesterday, but was a bit more enjoyable. I woke up late again, as usual, and went on the computer to skim some news and listen to music and the like. Then about an hour through, I got hungry and decided to eat something; I chose kix. Then I got out the guitar and started practicing this song I like called "Doin' The Cockroach". I think it's a really cool song. Then I got sick of it and started messing around with some other tunes and things that I've been working on and realized that it's a lot harder to make meaningful music than most people (including me) think. I called Sara to ask if she was free today, but she wasn't. I called Peter and I forget what we even talked about, but we talked about something of no great importance, seeing how I don't really  remember it. It wasn't bad or anything though, just... irrelevant. Then I lied around the house, finding different places that were comfortable. I picked up the guitar yet again, practiced some more, got sick of it, and then went online again. I saw Christina online, so said hi and we talked for a while. That was nice, as always. I got some irritating messages from my sister too though, which wasn't as nice. My cousin IM'd me too, but we didn't talk about anything worth mentioning here, so whatever. I made something to eat* while talking to people, too. Surprisingly, those lean cuisine things aren't as bad as I thought they were. I mean, they're not exactly the finest culinary experience, but they get the job done well enough :-). It was about the only thing in the freezer that didn't take like 3 hours to make and the only other options were cereal with water, raisins, various spices, maybe some popcorn (I forget and I'm too lazy to check), and soup. And since I had already had soup that day, I didn't really feel like having it again. Then I took a nap at around 1800ish and woke up an hour later. Then I wandered around the house and took another hour-long nap and woke up at around 2030ish. While I was sleeping, my dad called and invited me to dinner with him and this guy he's starting one of his businesses with, named Erik. He's got a PhD from the Media Lab and a masters from Harvard. He's pretty hardcore, but human at the same time. Anyway, being the deep sleeper I am, I didn't hear the phone vibrate all over the hardwood floor from across the house and so I couldn't go. And here I am now, writing a post about my uneventful day. Judging by the length of this post, one might guess I had a pretty exciting day, but I just went into unneeded detail about some obscure things. I guess that's just what I do though.  Thought of the undefined-time-period, I have a theory that most teenage bloggers are spoiled runts who just have way too much for their own good. I'm not excluding myself from this, by the way. I am spoiled. I mean, really, everything that I've done that's worth mentioning was not from my own perspiration, per se. I have had all kinds of opportunities provided by my uncles and dad, only though which I was allowed to do most of the things I do. Then again, to be reasonable, everyone has their own set of opportunities and hinderances, so to call someone spoiled because of something they couldn't control seems unfair. Perhaps a better metric is their attitude, outlook on life, and relationships with other people (no, not just something as stupid and remedial as dating. I mean like everyday interactions with people. e.g. Are you arrogant?) in relation to how many opportunities they've had. I try not to be spoiled, but it's damn hard. Meh, I don't know anymore. I'm probably just talking out of my ass, but I guess if there is one thing I want to walk away thinking from this section of the post, it's this: Don't resent your position in society, but rather accept it and learn how to use it to not only help yourself, but as many others as you can. Never be condescending, conceited, or arrogant. Don't be an elitist, and don't act like 7/8ths of the jews you've known in so far as helping your own for unfair reasons. Oh, and of course, be fair and honest.  On a semi-related note, I should reread Ben Franklin's autobiography. That's a really good book.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Reheated it in a microwave.

      Regarding my prediction of what would happen last night, I wasn't too far off except that I was lucky enough to instead of listening to NPR on the way home, talk about epistemology, learning, and educational systems. It was an interesting idea and I got to hear him rant about how he doesn't really like Seymour Papert and that while he agrees with him on a lot of issues, he just doesn't get it beyond a certain point. But, after we got home, it was pretty true to my prediction except that I went to the bathroom and fell asleep briefly in the process so decided that I was too tired to brush. Meh. I did it this morning which wasn't too much later considering that I went to bed at 0400 and woke up at 0954. I didn't really wake up until 1209 though because the first time I was just, like, walking around a bit, brushing my teeth and taking a leak, but again decided that I was too tired to do anything useful so went back to bed. Why would anyone care about what I just said? I have no clue, but I'll leave it up there because, ya know, what if someone DOES want to know about it.  On an unrelated side-note, the cable modem we have here at home just feels so much slower than the T3 we have at the lab. It's like getting off a horse to ride a donkey. Damn, that thing is fast! I'm think I'm just spoiled because I know there are some people in the world who are still on 28.8k* and actually have to wait for news pages to load.  On another entirely unrelated side-note, my cousin, Andres, Peter, whatever you want to call him, asked me a very interesting question once. It's harder than the question that inspired it, which makes it kinda interesting. Here it is: If you're good looking in a forest, but no one's around to see you, are you still good-looking? I dunno how interesting this actually is, but I found it quite interesting because the attribute "good-looking" is defined entirely by the subject looking at it, so, like... yeah. You think about it... if you want.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Andres, don't kill me! I'm too good-looking to die!

      I woke up at like 12 or 1 in the afternoon as usual after going to bed at like 4 or 5 last night doing some interesting things like stare at pleasant words sent from over a thousand miles away from one of my favorite far-away people. It was by no means a one-way conversation though. A bunch was being said by me. In any event, I woke up late.  Then I called my neighbor who's litterally, like, across the street and asked her if she could come over to clean the guinea pig cage. She gets payed like 5 dollars a visit and the visit is like once a week for less than 10 minutes. I'd do it myself, but I have a VERY light stomach and I once threw up all over the place when I tried to clean it myself. When we first got it, I had a heavier duty system and when I couldn't do it, my mom or sister would do it, but since I got meningitis a couple years back, I haven't been able to do it. Funky, huh?  Moving on, I then went to her place after being invited for lunch. It was pretty good, but I forget that I have this thing with eggplant that also makes me throw up. I don't know what it is about it, but it just rubs me the wrong way and I gag whenever it comes in contact with my tongue unless it's, like, cooked this special way. Again, that's kinda odd isn't it? Well, after hanging around her house for a while, she got bored and wanted to play cards, but I don't really like cards so I brought something from my place to entertain myself between the turns, my guitar. It was fun to play because people seem to really get into dudes with guitars, especially ones who play. So, I'm playing a little song and her family comes back from their walk and they all want to hear so they all gather around and now I'm really nervous and mess up on like everything, but I manage to make jokes that cross the italian language barrier because I managed to have them laughing by the end of it. I had a good time, anyway.  After that, let's see, I had to go because Sara (my neighbor) had to take a shower and well, it's not proper to just hang around when she's in the shower so I left and hung around the house, played some more guitar, talked to Christina for the littlest bit, made the Guess The Song IV post, and actually did something productive (in the formal sense of the word), but forgot what.  Then after all of this action, I got a phone call from my dad that interupted my conversation with Christina, but I'm talking to her as I write this post, so it's all good :-), asking me if I wanted to go to dinner with him and Ali (the ultra cool, ultra geeky, awesome dude) at John Harvard's. I accepted and took a bus over to Harvard Square and ended up waiting for a bit while they were late. Eventually they came and we went in and ordered and the like. We talked about some business stuff and computers and computers related to business stuff and just some purely random things.  Then, after dinner, we walked over to the Media Lab where I ended up waiting around most of the time, but it wasn't a bad thing. Ali and I got to talk about stuff and I ended up learning some stuff about processor architecture. Man, now THAT is a really cool field to get into... if only I had the patience to go through the boring math required for it. Oh, we also went over to talk to this other person we know, her name is Jacky. She's from England and is also highly cool. We talked about the economy, bush, world war 2, stalin, home-owner's insurance, cheap generic viagra, and diplomas without the work. I'm going to go see Fahrenheit 911 with her sometime soon... I think. That's at least what  she  said.  And so, after a little while of talking to her, I went back to my dad's office where he's been updating his computer and installing some apps that he'll be needing. It really is a lot of fun staring at progress bars for like 2 hours. Anyway, he wasn't done so I sat down on one of the couches and realized that I could sign on to AIM and check my e-mail and add to my blog with any of the bajillion machines sitting around here. After checking my mail and continuing a conversation with Christina, I started this post in my blog. I'm still talking to Christina now and my dad's waiting for me to get off the machine now so that we can go, but whatever. He's managed to busy himself now :-). I think that just about covers it.  I imagine that the last hours of the day will go down something like this, though: We'll walk over to the elevator, we'll wait for a bit, we'll take he elevator down and walk out of the building, through another building, and across a parking lot to get to our car. We'll get in, I'll put on my seatbelt and ask my dad to put his on, but he probably wont listen and will turn on NPR. We'll start to drive off and I will sit in the passenger seat awkwardly as I wished the radio was set to something more entertaining or at least less... monotonous or off so that I could tell him what was on my mind. Then we will finally arrive at home and I will check my messages on my mac and maybe reply to a couple of them briefly so that I could get to bed as soon as possible. Then I will probably brush my teeth and wash my hands. And finally, of couse, I'll take off my socks, shoes, over-shirt, shirt, and pants (in that order) and lie in bed until I fall asleep.  It's such a routine now that I think I should do something to make it more interesting, but knowing me, nothing will really happen. I'll pretend to make a change, but will get too lazy to fix it. Damn, I even know where I'll fail in an attempt to fix the problem! This sucks. I am now sad.   That is all. -- Feanor

      Alright everyone, it's that time of the... something again -- well, it's just that time again for Guess The Song. I'm not giving any hints for this one because I think it's on the radio enough for people to know right off what it is. I know I messed up a couple times in there, and I'm not entirely sure about that arpeggio in the rhythm, but I hear something like that in the song, so whatever. Guess away, and as usual post guesses in the comments.    urlLink

      NOTE: This is not a new post. It was originally posted on Unpasteurized on July 7th, 2004 at 18:16 EST, but has been duplicated and posted here for your convenience.  So, I was walking from the Kendall T Stop here in Boston to this pizza place called Emma's, which is really good, by the way. And I see this sign that reads something like "Lost Cat. Reward $600". The first thing I thought was damn, that's a lot of money. Then I thought, aww, what a cute cat. Then I thought, my cat's not really cute at all, she's old and fat and balding and getting stupid and mean. I would probably pay less than $50 reward for her. For 600 bucks, someone might actually spend time to look for a cat like that... Then it hit me!  Why not make semi-absurd sign that offers a massive, but realistic reward for something either incredibly common or incredibly hard to find. And so I visualized this sign in my head that read something like "lost possum. $300 reward" and I started giggling to myself after imagining a guy looking for a possum to bring me for his $300. What a fool he would be. Then my thoughts grew more humorous, to me anyway, and I began to think about putting Lost [x] signs up for things that are by definition fixed. Like "Lost Oak Tree. Last seen on the corner of Arlington and Main. Has 'I [heart] Shirley carved in bark' and 'Scott & Tiffany forever' etched inside a heart on the other side. Reward $400 cash." And then I would have the whole thing set up with a hole in the grass on one of the corners of the intersection about the size of a tree's trunk. Oh, how fun that would be. I mean, beyond a certain extent, it's not very funny, but I think it'd be very funny to see a Lost [x] picture like that... Or where the reward was something useless like "Reward 30 Twinkies" or something.  This was a waste of time, but it made me giggle. On an unrelated side-note, on that trip to Emma's, I found a 20 dollar bill lying on the ground and had a hard time deciding whether or not to take it. I ended up taking it after my dad said "God, Feanor, just pick up the damn money. Finder's keepers in these situations. If you don't pick it up, someone else will. It's not like the guy will come back and get it." That was 110% irrelevant.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I HATE CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE THAT THE STATE GETS CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE FUCKING NATION! It's the most fucking obnoxious state in terms of every fucking set of laws that one can imagine. Their marriage laws are fucking retarded, their divorce laws are fucking retarded, their tax laws are fucking retarded, their business laws are fucking retarded, their miscellaneous laws and principals are fucking retarded and most importantly to me right now, their driving laws are fucking retarded. Supposedly, even if you have a full out-of-state license, but are younger than 18, you have to go through their whole stupid fucking set of driving laws or just never take employment or residence in CA. It just gets under my skin and I'm no saying this as some elitist north-east coasty. I've lived there for while, and I still live there. It's things like that that make me what to just kill entire coastlines.  Wow, I need to cool off.  Deep breathe... Long exhale... Deep breathe... Long exhale... Woooo... woooo... much better.  I feel much better now.  That is all. -- Feanor

       NOTE: THIS POST WAS STARTED ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 5TH, 2004   I'm sorry for not having posted this much sooner, but it's kinda hard because my dad's been over my shoulder the whole time and it's a little hard to post anything when he's like constantly reading it as it's being typed. His computer etiquette needs a little work -.-. This is the long-awaited post that has been delayed by parties, sleep, and (something else). It's pretty much just gonna go into some detail about the stuff that's been happening lately, at least what I can remember of it. Some of it goes back a whole three days and my memory is kinda hazy between 1.5 and 4.5 days. If I remember it for longer than 4.5 days, then I'll remember it for a long while, usually.  Ok, so let's start with how I am doing now and what I feel like because god knows that this post will be so long that I'll forget what I meant to say at the start. I keep forgetting it actually, as I type these introductory sentences so whatever...  Anyway, I miss my G4 TiBook. I sent it in for repair and I wont get it back for like a week and a half :'(. I knew this would happen. I guess that's why I've been putting it off for so long. The machine had ben broken since February, but I got it to work off and on for since then until I came here and when I did, it was all over and I just had to take it in. Sigh. Farewell, beloved mac.  My lack of my-own-computerage has also been effecting my music listening action because I don't have any way to hook my iPod up to this ancient Mac (I love it anyway) and I didn't bring my speakers from LA with me. But seriously, who travels with a set of speakers? That's the kinda thing you put on a moving truck. Imagine me walking through an airport with a studio monitor under each arm... Well, I don't actually have studio monitors for speakers, but I have these little BOSE ones that are a little awkward to fit in my backpack :-\. I wish I had cool studio monitors like that though.  So, yeah, instead of listening to music on real speakers (I brought my TriPorts (which broke in my backpack on the trip here), I've been playing it on my guitar. Recently, I've been practicing "Doin' the Cockroach" by Modest Mouse from The Lonesome Crowded West. It's such an awesome song. Check it out on the iTunes Music Store. Aaah, so much awesome in so little time.  Oh, right, and I also will be getting my full Massachusetts driver's license before I leave the state, which should be around the 23th'ish(?). That's cool because that means when I go back to California, I don't have to wait forever to get a provisional piece of shit and that I can get a real one right off the bat*. I'd stay with a Massachusetts license, but California has this stupid law that if the car is insured in my name, that the out of state (Massachusetts) license is only valid for 10 days. Fucking retarded californians. Anyway, that's good.  Oh, and I can't forget what I did today either because I've already written down a list of things I needed to blog about in the past few days, so before I forget, I played a bunch of guitar today and cleaned out the attic because we have to move out of the place we're in now so that we can move to California and give the place to a friend of ours. His name is Andrew, his wife's name is Anandita (sp?), and they're both exceedingly awesome. Anyway, cleaning the attic wasn't a lot of fun because it brings back a lot of painful, not bad, necessarily, but painful nonetheless memories of when the family was together and my mom and sister weren't fucking moronic, retarded bitches who let their "dreams" interfere with their real lives and practicality. It also gets me really angry to know that I'm even related to these people, but whatever, I have to live with it. It's not like I have a lot to complain about. It's the lot that god's given to me so I guess I have to work with it. Sigh.  On a lighter note, I went to see my old neighbor Sara, and she is still cool. A little more cool than before, but a not a big difference. I talked to her briefly from outside her window because she wouldn't let me in because she said that she looked like crap. She ended up having to give me something though so I ended up seeing her anyway and she looked fine. Girls, go figure. Anyway, she said she'd call me when she got outta the shower and that if she didn't, I should call her, so I did but she didn't pick up on either of her phones. I think she's avoiding me for some peculiar reason. Maybe she's so deeply in love with me that she knows that if she lets me come even the slightest bit to close, she could not resist and would have to make love to me right there on the spot and would never be able to let me go and will be eternally pained from my having to leave her to go to LA (just like in those cheesy** latin movies)... But my money's on it being something I said outside her window like "You know that's a logical loophole, right?" I should learn when to keep my mouth shut.  On a sidenote, I learned that it is damn easy to just not tell people what's going on and act like they're stupid if they ask you a question. It was fun. Oh, and I couldn't find the pruning shears so I wasn't able to prune the trees. Ah yes, and it rained. I love the rain.  Ok, I think that just about covers the day. So, moving onto the list of like a million*** things to talk about. They're not in any particular order though. It's just about whatever came to my head at the time I was making the list. I hope I got everything.  Alright, so I was interrupted half-way through posting this to go out to get some dinner, so I saved it as a draft and here I am returning to it. It turns out that a lot can happen in a few hours... Not very much happened with me or anyone that I ran into, but I just thought that was worth noting. Anyway, we went to John Harvard's, which is this bar/restaurant thing in Cambridge. It's my favorite place to eat in the Greater Boston Area, actually. Tonight was trivia night or something like that so there were these trivia questions being asked the whole time and there were these like 8 groups competing for a prize. A team of 5 guys each won 50 bucks to starbucks coffee, not bad if you ask me. So, after we went to dinner, we went over to the MIT Media Lab (my dad's old, but still going work) and picked up some machines to bring back home so that we could both get some work done. It was cool. I forgot, during dinner I remembered just how much I miss my late cousin. I wish so much that he was alive today because I'm just getting to the age where we could have had a really good time together, traveling, listening to music, going to concerts, hanging out, just everything. I almost started crying at the restaurant and my throat ended up hurting for a bit. I love John Marie. Rest In Peace, dear cousin.  Alright, so now here's the rest of the post... Damn, I'm tired. I think I'll just save what I've got so far as a draft and finish it tomorrow morning.  .. ... ..  Morning of July 6th, The Long Awaited Post continued... The Day of July 6th passed and I didn't get a chance to write anything so here starts from the very late evening of the 6th of July.  Ok, so here starts the long awaited post...  I don't know how much of this I've already said, but I'm too lazy to check so whatever. Since I've arrived in Boston, the weather has been amazingly good. It's a little humid, but great for this time of year in Boston. On the first night, I unpacked all my stuff and discovered that this house, being mostly empty and made of like all wood and not having carpeting, acts as a really cool amplifier for guitar and vocals. Mucho neato. On the second day, which must have been like the 3rd, I went to the mall with my dad to see Ali, one of the friends I have here in Boston. He's a hardcore geek, I'm talking seriously hardcore, like this guy is building a real operating system from scratch that uses only the best algorithms and has all kinds of ungodly features that even windows, mac os x, and linux don't have. This thing he's making is totally gonna kick all ass. Anyway, we went to the mall and we dropped off the TiBook at the Apple Store after like months of procrastination and just not wanting to do it because I'd miss him too much. Anyway, it finally got done and my dad and Ali had some kind of business meeting in the food court until I got back. When I got back, we, well, they really, started talking about how much Apple sucks just to bother me. They did have some valid points though. Sigh. Poor Apple. Oh, and I hadn't been sleeping much the nights before (I think I was on like 18 hours of sleep and this was the 7th day) so my back muscles were extremely fatigued so I couldn't walk straight, so I ended up walking around the mall for like half an hour like a cripple. Supposedly, I looked pretty funny, but it wasn't any fun for me. Then we all went down to Harvard Square and got some chocolate and walked around and my dad, Ali, and I talked some more about stuff, including business and Ali's OS. I think his geekiness is contagious because whenever I'm around him, I become geekier too and start to remember stuff I learned a long time ago about computers and just start looking at the world differently. It's kinda cool. Then after that, I think we went home and I chatted with a few people on AIM and my dad yelled at his computer and my mom over the phone (well, it was mutual. I could hear my mom yelling through the receiver) and I played guitar and probably fell asleep way too late. I don't remember very well, but whatever. It's my blog and I'm lucky to remember any of it so that I can write it down. Oh, one more thing, I think it was on that night that I made a million mis-comments on LizMartin's blog and managed to supposedly make her laugh. That made my day. Oh, right and another thing is that I ran into my neighbor and we started talking and I gave her a gmail account. Wasn't that nice of me?  Anyway, on the 4th, I was at home, doing the usual, playing guitar, taking a shower, reading blogs, chatting on aim, until Alice, the neighbor across the street called me over and asked me to help her move like 60 big-ass packages of shingles out of her car for her for like 10 bucks an hour. Me, being the broke and mostly unoccupied teenager I am took up the offer and moved all her shingles and got myself a whopping 20 bucks. Only thing is that now, even though I'm well rested, my back still hurts but from lifting all that weight this time. Wow, will I ever learn? Later that day, we went to Andrew's party, a former student of my dad's who's going to be one of the people starting one of the companies that my dad's working on with him (this sentence is really confusing for me, but whatever; it's late.). It was a good party, nothing too wild or anything, more of a get-together with beer and burgers and chips and bean-dip and cake and some other good stuff. I didn't drink anything though. I figured it might hurt my dad's image and when my dad's image gets hurt that means less money for the family, and when there's less money for the family, there's less money for me :-D. It's all so logical. At the party, I met this guy named Nick, who's Andrew's cousin who's been playing guitar for like 10 years and he's like 24 now and he's so friggin' awesome at it. I wanted to get a lesson or two from him while he was here because he's leaving in a couple weeks for Detroit, but I dunno if I can because my dad isn't too cool about it and you know how it goes with him. More brownie points with dad = more cash for ol' Feanor. I feel evil. Anyway, he's totally cool and after we were at the party, we went to see the fireworks, which were recorded and posted earlier :-P. On an unrelated side-note, Andrew has a very cute little sister who's like 15 and she also has some very cute friends, but that's all totally irrelevant. Why did I say any of that? I guess it's some kinda subconscious thingy.  Moving on, the rest of what I meant to post about is scattered and would take way too much energy to organize so I'll let you do it :-).  Here are the scattered facts about my trip so far that I'm just too lazy to find the proper place for in this already very long post, so I just threw 'em in at the bottom. I really like being back here in Boston and the longer I stay, the more I love it. It will be hard to go back to the fantasy land of mansions and expensive cars and millionaires that is southern california. I also really like having a yard. Since I've gotten here, I've been wanting to work out there, but I haven't got the tools to do so. I need the prune the trees so that they grow properly, but someone lost the pruning shears so I can't do that and it's been raining a bunch so I can't water the lawn, and the grass isn't growing very fast so I can't mow the lawn. It's just all very sad, but it'll be fine. It all will fall, fall right into place, in the spirit of Modest Mouse. Well, at leas I got to use the weed-wacker to clean up the edges of the walkways and stuff; that was fun. Oh, and since I've come here, I have a new diet of kix cereal and Total, which reminds me... I think I know how they manage to get all those vitamins into the cereal. They just make the cereal denser and taste less good by adding way too much sugar to cover up the icky texture of it. Total raisin bran does not compare to Kellogg's. GO KELLOGG'S!! Oh, and on the night of the third I think it was, I went over to a friend's (scooby) apartment to play his three pinball machines and I had a lot of fun.  I'd like to separate this piece of semi-random data from the rest of the mess though because it's of more importance to me and I feel it deserves some breathing room:  urlLink Christina  is so totally awesome for one, having a very funny blog, and two, for knowing what song I was playing on Guess The Song III and for commenting where it counts :-).  In other news:  urlLink LizMartin , another very cool girl, commented on my blog and I appreciate that. Her blog is more than worth a look, so if you get a chance, go check it out. It's Texan and therefore, good... Well, that's not always the case, but this happens to be Texan AND good go check it out :-D. Also,  urlLink Missy  joined the ranks of awesome when she participated in the ridiculous game of "decode my extremely obscure message hidden in 'Answers to Guess The Song I and II'". Her blog is also worth reading and is occasionally seen dancing naked in the rain or swimming and/or sun bathing at nude beaches. Let's all give a big round of applause to all of the awesome ladies who comment. ::claps::  Alright, let's go down the list... this, that,, that, got that, this, that, there, yeah, we did that, uh huh, yep, oh, what?, no, wait, yeah, we did that, yeah, that, that, that, ya huh, yeah, yep, aaaand ok. I think that just about covers it all. Damn, this post was long. Thanks for reading, and if you skipped to the end without reading the whole thing, you should be ashamed of yourself! Go to the corner right now!... Or you  could  just read the whole thing... Aww, I just can't stay mad at you.  That is all. -- Feanor   * Plus like a hundred bucks or so and another road test and some kinda written thing.  ** Cliché  *** This is an exaggeration. It's more like 18.

      Alright,  sorry for not having posted that long awaited post today. I've just been really busy lately. I had to be rushed out of the house this morning only to end up waiting on someone else to take my stupid picture for this site I'm doing for this rec letter I'm getting, and not a shabby one, if I may say so myself...  Anyway, I went to the Media Lab today and waited around for most of the day and called my grandmother (Mother's Mom). She's a really cool lady. She's old, but really over-worked. I hate my uncle (mom's brother) because he's a bigoted, cock-sucking coward who talks lies and shit behind my back because I'm smarter than him. What a cunt. Oh, and he also has like 8 kids and isn't stopping anytime soon because he has some kinda insecurity complex about being a good catholic. I hate the fake fuck more than the devil (and I hate the devil, trust me). He gives HIS OWN MOTHER a friggin' salary for taking care of his fucking army so that he and his wife can copulate (fuck) some more and make more and more kids and have their nice jobs to support it, as opposed to doing the reasonable thing and just stop fucking for a minute or two to take care of their own kids and just let his mom have a rest for the last bit of her life. Meanwhile, my 74 or 75 or something year-old arthritic grandmother has to take care of, raise, and home-school all of his little runts. I just hate his fucking guts and feel bad for her. MY GOD, and he's friggin' one of these conservative assholes who only watches fox news because god-forbid he ever see some real facts without a mucho grande rightward spin on it and then calls me unpatriotic for being liberal. Ya know what I'll tell him next time I see him? "Go fuck yourself, you old fat, first and half generation chinese fuck with an identity problem. I have more of a fucking right to be here than you, assfucking, orphan abondoning shitface (that's a whole other story). Second generation, you ignorant old fart, so dont for a second question my alliegence and patriotism and citizenship and whatnot to this counrty. I love it not for how it pampers me, but for what it stands for, unlike your stupid, republican ass*." And I'll say that right to his face, in front of all my cousins and aunts and uncles and his wife and my grandmother. I will have the entier family know how much I despise the existance of this man. Footnote Below**.  Anyway, getting back to my original story, after I called her, I got the pictures taken and sent them to my dad's brother (one of the ones I don't hate at all, and in fact think is really cool), but didn't get a response. Whatever, at least I did my part. I also saw some old friends and got a Mac OS 9.1.2 disc from one of them to fix one of my macs. Then after that, I hung around and then came home to fix up the old mac that I want to turn into a music server for the house. It didn't work though, so I guess I'll just have to take it back to Los Angeles with me or something. Actually, I don't know what I'll do with it. Then after that, I played guitar and yelled some random words that actually turned out to be pretty cool sounding songs. I forgot how they went though >_  I'm going to go work on the Long Awaited Post now, but no guarantees on quality. It's just   REALLY   long. I think I'll also write a post for Unpasteurized. It's been a while since I've done that so I guess I should... I'll leave a copy on this one too though.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Not all conservatives/republicans are stupid, but he is.  ** If anyone wants to know why exactly I hate him so much and why I think he should be killed in the fashion of the spanish inquesition, just leave a comment saying so and I will write a post about it, gladly. I need to vent a bit, ya know?

      It sounds like I'm just making this shit up now, isn't it? Well, I'm not. I went to an old friend of mine's party and talked to a bunch of people and now I have a new guitar teacher/helper for 20 days. He's such a cool guy. Oh, and I worked for my neighbor for a couple hours emptying the shingles out of her car for like 20 bucks. Not horrible for unskilled labor, if you ask me. Anyway, that's about all the time I have for posting because my dad is on my ass yet again for being up so late. Oh, right, one more thing... Andy Roddick (#2 in world tennis) is kinda hot in my opinion. I dunno what most girls think, but he's got a nice look about him. I know some girls really hate beards and stuff, but I think that I'd rather have 'em a little scruffy than baldy-faced. That's just me though, but even still if Roddick shaved, he'd still be hot. I have a theory, a weak generalization with no proof whatsoever is more like it, but it goes like "Guys look better when they're sweaty than when they're not in most natural* scenarios." Anyway, that was dumb, and no, I'm not gay -.-.  I will be sure to make a massive post about everything tomorrow. I don't have a lot to do then.  That is all. -- Feanor   * Clubs, raves, discos, (whatever you want to call it), restaurants, the dinner table, a party, things like this are not natural. They are totally man-made and are like, unnatural.

      I recorded almost all of the Fireworks from he Boston 4th of July celebration thing with my phone and posted them here. It turns out though that you guys are missing like 5 or 6 minutes of it because instead of pressing 1 on my phone, I hit the (end call) button and i only realized it like 5 minutes later. Sorry about that. Anyway, here are the sounds of the fireworks from the celebration:  Part 1:   urlLink

      Sorry again everyone for not posting when I said I would. This time I swear upon it on my recent great grandfather's grave. Man, that's a lot of pressure...  Damn, I really shouldn't have gotten myself into that...  Anyway, here's a short summary what's been happening today: I practiced the guitar, I woke up really late, I watch Wimbledon final, found out my friend is a liar (It was harmless, don't worry), and will be pruning the trees in the yard today. I also have to catch a bus, ride a train, and walk to a RadioShack to buy some batteries and some adapter cables. I am so stupid for not having brought those from LA.  Long-ass post to come about everything over the past few days in detail tonight. I bet it will top a couple thousand words.  That is all. -- Feanor

      NOTE: If you want to guess the song before you read the answer, don't read the rest of this message, but just in case you do accidentally, I'm write the answer in a code.  This is a little depressing. It seems that no one is posting guesses for songs 'cept Missy here who didn't know the artist, but was nice enough to at least post a comment. Let's all give Missy a round of applause and check out her blog. Anyway, don't think that just because you don't guess, it'll make me stop doing these. It wont, and in fact will make me want to do it more, so just guess even if you know you're wrong or think that your guess will be stupid.  The code is my left and right hands are shifted right a key so that my left hand has it's fingers on sdfg and my right hand has 'em on kl;'.  Here are the answer Guess The Song I: Noh Fo[[rt nu Niol;y Yp D[o;; gtp, Yjrtr Od Moyjomh Etpnh Eoyj :pbr  Here are the answer Guess The Song II: D;rr[es;lomh nu ,pfrdy ,pidr gtp, Niolf Dp,ryjomh Piy Pg Mpyjomh  He he.

      I feel that I should apologize to everyone in advance for not having posted anything for a bit and not being able to post anything now. Here's a really short summary of what's up, but I have to go soon because my dad's being a bit of a hardass about me getting to sleep and justifiably. I've only gotten like 18 hours in the past 4 or 5 days, I forget >_  Anyway, I'm in Watertown (a small city next to Boston) now and I just got back from playing pinball at my friend's place in Cambridge (Right across the river from Boston), which is about 6 miles away from my house. I had a great time, he's a really cool dude and I'll write a nice long post about it and my other adventures tomorrow morning. I wrote a little draft post for myself to remind me of what to write about so I guess that'll have to do for now.  Sorry again for the Sleep-Induced Delay.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Alright, so in this Guess The Song, we have a guest guitarist (Peter) because the song requires 5 guitars. Only the two main of which we played at any given time. I am the rhythm guitar (the one that comes in first) and he's the fancy-shmancy melody guy who does the stuff I can't do yet. I'm learning though :-). Oh, and please forgive me for messing up a bunch of times through out the tune on the strumming pattern. Anyway, post guesses in the comments. Ah, that reminds me, apparently people have no idea what they're listening for, so I'll give you a hint.    urlLink

      YES! The time has finally come! I am going to Boston tomorrow afternoon* for a three-week trip to get my braces off, finally. I started out with a messed up mouth with crowding and crookedness, but ~20 months, 15 broken brackets, 8 broken bands, 4 bend and/or broken arch-wires, and 4 round trip plane tickets later, my teeth are finally fixed. Hoorah!  As you can tell, I'm totally psyched about this trip. I mean, the braces, walking around my true home-city, seeing my old friends at MIT. It'll all be so nice. Sigh. I'm sure of... almost. I'll also get to see the fireworks out there, which are really amazing. They seem to get better and better every year. It's good stuff. If you ever get a chance, go to Boston for the 4th of July and camp out on the Cambridge side of the Charles River on Memorial Drive right around Kendall Square in MIT. It's good stuff.  Anyway, I'm really excited and might not post for a few days due to lack of connection, but I doubt that because I have an old Tangerine iMac (Rev A (can you believe it?)) that's more than plenty to write a post and surf the net and check my mail and whatnot. Worse comes to worst though, I can always do an audiopost and practice using my higher speaking voice. I REALLY don't like how low it is. It's... boring.  I'd try and make some kinda joke or something to make you feel a little better about spending your time to read this post, but I can't think of anything funny. Sorry :-P.

      I went to work today for the last time for the next 3 weeks at least. It was quite possibly one of the least productive days for how many hours I was there, but at least I learned something and earned hours. I learned that neuro-imaging was a massive pain in the ass back in the day where everything needed to be done by hand, before the days of programs that automatically aligned the brains to a space, before programs that automatically generated a native mask, and before the days of programs that made no-cerebellum masks for you. I'm so glad I wasn't doing this back in those days. I almost exploded after trying to align a brain to the atlas. Cries.  Moving on, after work I realized I didn't have any money and that I was kinda stuck in UCLA until I could get a ride out. After waiting for a few minutes, I called my uncles (Babak for work, and then Bahador for fun) and Bahador answered after I didn't reach Babak. I talked to him for a bit over the phone and explained how I didn't have any money and so he offered to pick me up and I graciously ( :-P ) took it. We went to Fantastic Sam's to get him a haircut. The one we went to is in one of the standard issue plazas that litter the Los Angeles CityScape. On just about every corner, there's one of these little plazas with a little parking lot with anywhere from 5 to ~18 stores. They're not very pretty or very much fun to walk around, but seeing how I didn't have much else to do other than wait in Fantastic Sam's, I walked around and walked into each of the little shops and asked the owners questions. They weren't bad questions or anything, I was just asking about what they did or about items on their menu or the history of their place. In the process I found out that the dude who either works at or owns "Hong Kong Chinese Food" is an ass and that if you're ever in Los Angeles (or Lost Angels as I like to call it) to not eat there because he's a jerk. Not that this paragraph has any sharp point in particular, but here's the point I was meaning to make...  While I was walking between the stores of the plaza, it was incredibly quiet. Lost Angels is not usually quite... ever. Especially not at like 6 or 7 in the evening. It just felt very surreal. I kinda liked it and I kinda didn't. I was kinda hoping that some persian jerk (I'm persian so I get to make fun of them. Don't PMS (it's a verb now) me out.) would speed by in his nice, new, fancy, black, loaded Beemer with some persian dance music blaring, only half paying attention to the road because the rest of his attention is going to how his new Armani shades look and go with his overly-gelled hair and how all the ladies are reacting and thinking that he's all hot. What a dork. -- Eehh, I went off on a tangent. Now back on track, I was also half-hoping that no cars would come so that I could continue to feel this extremely uncomfortable, yet comfortable feeling. It was just weird.  Oh, I also realized that I can't read or watch or listen to the news anymore because I realized today that it's all so disgustingly inaccurate in favor of current American policies and not the real american principals, or even (and god forbid this ever happen) the facts. It makes me sad.  After we got his haircut, we went over to his place where we just hung out as he played the keyboards and we listened to Float On and talked. We also saw Spider-Man 2 tonight. I had a really good time, not because the movie was amazing though. I mean, it was pretty good, but the physics was, as you could expect, extremely unrealistic and there were a few extremely cheesy lines. Anyway, what really made it great was these 5 black girls behind us who kept making hilarious  commentary on every part and cracking jokes about various cheesy lines and rhetorical questions. There was also this one girl who, judging by the pitch of her voice, was like 4 who screamed "STOP IT!!" for all to hear at this one messy* kissing scene. Upon hearing this, the entire theater busted up laughing uncontrollably for like 3 minutes. Oh, and my uncle was also pointing out pointless, but funny details about stuff in the background. Like there was this one part where the evil dude throws a car, and my uncle, being the car-rental owner, car salesman, and auto-body shop owner, noticed that it was a brand new Ford Focus that was thrown and started stating prices for the amount of body damage that was done. It was just funny and it was a really good time.  Hmmm... let's see... I think that just about covers the day... Yep.  That is all. -- Feanor  * The kind that's only in movies and stuff. I mean, no one REALLY kisses like that. If they did, their faces would be all wet and would need a towel to dry off. I shudder to think about what their sex would be like if their daily, public kissing was that long and wet and messy. >_

      Audioblogger has taught me a few things, believe it or not. I learned after listening to my voice back through the machine, that it's a lot lower than I thought. I don't like it being so low and I think I'll start working on my tenor singing. If you're all lucky, you might even get to hear me if I ever work up the courage to sing into a phone. Last time I did that, Shannon (ex-girlfriend) asked me to and I was in that stupid early-teen love. Ugh. Just thinking about it, makes me depressed at how degenerate I was. Ewwww!!  Anyway, getting back to audioblogger making me sad, my cousin and I did a Guess The Song III but with a song that requires 4 guitars. Of course we only did the two most-main ones though. Here's a hint for what the song is: It was used in a few Nissan TV ad. I have nothing more to say, that I can think of now -- oh, right, if you see two audioposts without text attached to them, they weren't really checked and they're kinda messed up, but the main idea comes across.

      Note: That title means nothing.  So, last night I stayed up until like 5AM working on masks until I decided that it's better to collapse onto my bed than to fall over and drool on the palmrests of my TiBook. Anyway, I woke up at like 8 and damn, was I tired. I finished up the last few slices of the one I was working on last night and completely did the other one in 2.5 hours. I left for work at 12:30 and got there at like 13:15 and did what work I could until I got stuck and talked to Rebecca. She said that she wouldn't answer my questions anymore and that I should save them all up for question sessions once a week, which to me seems kinda stupid, but whatever. She's the boss, so I guess I have to follow her rules. Anyway, I got there and only had like an hour or two worth of work, TOPS before I got stuck on the pipeline, so I just left at like 15:00 or so because I saw no point in working on nothing and called Babak asking him what was up with the Younai situation. He said we meet her tomorrow and that he was at Sharzahd (I think I spelled that wrong, but whatever) which is on Westwood Blvd. just down the road of the Westwood Village, if I wanted to meet up with him. I did, so I walked down and met up with him, his fiancé and her brother, who happens to share my first name. It can get irritating especially because they speak farsi all the time and I can never figure out what they're saying or whether they're calling me or him. Whatever, some more, I guess. After lunch, we headed over to a little persian bookstore, looked around a bit, then went to Borders and looked around a bit more, didn't buy anything though. Then we headed over to this field to play some soccer with some people Babak knows, but we had to stop off at his house first because Amir didn't have shoes or proper clothing or anything. After we got Amir dressed, we headed over to the field and played a bit. It was an ok, leaning towards bad game. I mean, the people in Boston are just so much better when it comes to pick-up soccer. I'm probably just being reminiscent though and looking at the situation through a warped lens. After an hour, if that, of soccer, we went to Jamba Juice and got some smoothies and all was good. We then went to Babak's house and hung out for a while until we had to go get Babak's car, which was still at Sharzahd. And finally, after this long and exciting day, Amir and his sister (I really don't wanna mess up the spelling of her name >_  I haven't been feeling very good today, or the past few days, really. I don't know why. I think I feel kind of like Boston is so much farther away than it was before and that really hurts. I mean, I helped the new tenants of the place that I lived for five years move in. Thinking back, that was really kind of disturbing. I miss the days when the family was united and at least felt like a unit. I don't think it will ever have that same level of unity again, despite my dad's moving out here. Something fundamental about this family got FUCKED when my mom and sister left for this hellhole in the first place. I don't hate them or anything for it, but I kind of resent it in a way. In any event, I also realized I've been having this very odd feeling for the past few days. I feel both loved and lonely at the same time. It's horrible because I feel lonely and therefore sad, but I feel like it's not legitimate or grounded in anything real so I end up hating myself. I really don't like things now, but I guess I should hope for the best and have a positive outlook because, as has always been my philosophy, if you have a negative outlook, you'll never see the good in anything. I guess I should stop whining because I have it pretty good. I also feel kind of anxious. I don't want to prep for the SATs again and I don't want to study math and I don't want to do anything but sleep, play guitar, and talk to people. What in god's name was I meant to do? I mean, jeez, I'm technically a fucking Genius, or at least close (163 IQ; test taken at third grade) and I have no direction or drive or anything. WHY IS GOD DOING THIS TO ME?! FUCK!...  Fuck is right. God, send me a message or something because this really sucks.  Looking back on this post, it doesn't make much sense, it's unorganized, and lacks... ness. Whatever. I'm too tired and busy self-loathing to care.  I miss christina :-(.  That is all. -- Feanor

      I'm sorry to all the readers of this blog. A few days ago, one of my [often] month-long waves of depression started and I just haven't been in the mood to do anything that I don't HAVE to do to not get my ass kicked in a major way. In any event, sorry everyone. I've been add the raw stuff you saw earlier to a file and I think I'll just not be such a self-pitying pussy and post something I find interesting sometime soon.

      I've decided that I'm going to become one of those people who define any word bigger than two syllables as if the definitions are different for different people. By 'definition' I mean the meaning of the word, and by 'different people' I mean people who aren't the same.

      One thing I’d like to do someday is get an army of little kids with PVC swords— in fact, what’d be awesome, is two armies of little kids with PVC pipes charging at each other. I’d gather all my friends around, we’d have bets (“Alright Amir, whom’re ya puttin’ your money on? Shirts or skins?”). Only problem is resources, where would I get all that PVC? Getting’ kids is no problem, my uncle Gin must have approximately  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  (which actually adds up to a billion) by now.

      I am now, officially old enough to get a permit. Even though I won't actually be driving for several years. but that's not the point, the point is not that I'm driving, it's that I'm driving age. Pure cool. Hmm, seems like such a waste.    I remember once, when Amir was over at my house, his cell' phone had an internet connection, so we were at  urlLink Pick the Hottie , and we were discussing whether or not we should stay up all night. Amir asked what time it was, and I told him that it was six o'clock in the morning (I didn't actually say, "in the morning" because I think he realized that it was already the morning). He replied, "Everyone's going to come through here and make lots of noise and wake us up in two hours anyway, so we might as well stay up." I replied, "OK," turning back to the phone, "which one is hotter, first or second?" There was a pause. "Amir?"  That isn't the first time that happened either. Once, he and I were discussing how to go about writing a certain algorithm for a 3D engine, I asked him a question, and he replied, "Let me think with my eyes closed." Pause. "Amir?"  That's Amir for yeh.

      Dear Unpasteurized Readers  I've messed around with the template for this blog. I'm not a complete Javascript or HTML expert, in fact, I'll probably find out next week that I was actually programming in PHP or something.

      I think I just discovered why people dance on the stage during a live performance. They don't want people to see what notes they're playing.  Take Noodles, from The Offspring, he must have lost his legs (maybe back when he was a janitor) and had them replaced with pogo sticks or something; because he just hops up and down throughout the song (or at least in all the videos I saw).  Do you want to know what I think? I think all bands play a reasonable chord when recording, but when it's time for the live show, they tune their guitars to something ridiculous like A G B D F Y and change the fingering around so that tabbers can't figure out what they're playing.  Modest Mouse, when playing  Bury Me with It  live, what one sees him play totally contradicts what one hears him play. Well at least there was a guy in the audience with a mohawk.

      When I grew up, I was the kid whose parents bought generic fruit soda while the other kids got the cool snacks and drinks; such as fruit-by-the-foot, coke (with its 36 tablespoons of sugar, or whatever it is), and the disgusting sugar packed marshmallow cereals for breakfast lunch and/or dinner. Who cares if they suffered from severe acne and nearly died when they were ten? It's not the girls I'm trying to attract-- actually, well yes it is. So, thank you mom and pop (yes, I call my dad 'pop'), you did the right thing.

      Here's my position on AIM Away Messages: I don't have one...  But I prefer the ones that have something funny in them. I don't really care where you went, just as long as I know you'll come back eventually. One thing though, people who put suicidal notes in their away message piss me off. Oh, or these people who think that it's acceptable to put a very personal message in a very public place like "I hate you, Griff! You're a fucking dirtbag and you should go to hell and bla bla bla PMS shit!" Or these people who make inside jokes in their away messages also get on my nerves. You check someone's info and you see "R U   GoNNa eAt ThE bUNnY? !? LOL. I krak mislf ^. gud tyms,,,, good tyms.,.,!?!" and the first thing I think is "Man, I'm embarrassed to even know this piece of sh -- I mean "person". Aside from blatantly disregarding anything she learned about punctuation, grammar, and spelling, she can't even type because those are commas, not periods. It's also not technically proper to use more than one punctuation at the end of a sentence. Also, What is up with these people who mix the caps? Not only do you waste time mixing them, you're making my life harder because I can't even read the sh -- shhhtufff (yeah, stuff) when it's like that. Sigh.   It's not like any of those idiots will ever read this so with that said, I'll break into some quick  7331 speak:  Hoo r u?! !> d0oD u sukd bgtym dat gam I ttly pwn'd u wen we wer plaeng u dnt std a chnc >| mi! !? !? I rxrz ur bxrz 2 hel,btch! ha ha, koknoker. u sux!   That was disgusting. I feel... dirty after even typing like that for 5 minutes. Sad part is that I've seen worse on bnet, much worse.

      I have come to the conclusion that soap, deep penetrating thingies, foams, exfoliators, astringents, and facial scrubs are only capable of going so far in terms of clearing up my acne. My theory is for me to really combat this problem I'd need to make a life-style change and we all know how I hate those. Now, as I've said before, I'm no chemist or biologist, but I think that my diet of ho-ho's, sugar'd popcorn, ramen, and shrek candies are my worst enemies at the moment. There are also reports of high Dorito and Lay's Stax consumption that may also be contributing to the problem. Well, instead of a real change in my lifestyle that would fix the problem, I think I'll just do the american thing and just settle with declaring war on it.    We, the people of Unpasteurized, declare an all out war on Acne!! We won't stop until every pimple is destroyed!   ... but we won't  actually  do anything about it.

      What’s with all this talk about unbiased information? Who the hell wants unbiased information? I don’t want to know the whole truth; I want to know part of it because there’s a significantly smaller amount of truth in the biased truth. How much information out there is biased towards Bush? Hmm? Not very much! Why read  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  (which actually adds up to millions) of articles out there against Bush? I mean, everybody and his brother, American or not, has written something against Bush. First of all, it seems like a time wasting subject anyway, so why waste time reading millions of things against Bush when you can read one thing for him? There you go, time saved on political crap, go to Chipotle and buy two burritos and hide them in the park outside my house (don’t worry, I’ll find them).

      Today I proved the evolution theory false, I took my fish out of the bowl, and it didn't turn into a monkey. To offer more proof, for you skeptical people, I put a grasshopper in the aquarium and he didn't turn into a fish. I'm surprised by my own genius, I can't believe that for so long people have believed the evolution theory and it is proven false by something so simple. On a related note, I need money for a new fish, if anyone would like to donate, leave the money anywhere in the new park that's still under construction outside my house. Don't worry, I'll find it, just make sure it smells like steak for my dog to detect it.

      Man, I'd be so lost. I guess I'd just do nice things for people, like teleport some pigeon turd that's about to land on a nice person's car to some dicksniffer's scalp. I might save some souls, possibly freak people out with voices in their heads. Throw a giant knife with a blade the size of the longest side of nebraska into the astrology council's main headquarters. I'd probably kill some evil fuckers too, but I would make it an easy death, ya know, something more painless than painful. All in all, while I think I'd be a nice god who would do a better job than the one we have in power now, I'd hate his job. It's kinda like the presidency of the United States; we could all do a better job than Ol' Dubya, but would any of us really want to spend 4 years in that shithole? I didn't think so.  ...  Well, maybe a masochist like me, but really, anyone else?  That is all.         -- Feanor

      This post has been in the making for more than a month (since June 26th), mostly because I didn't feel that it ended right, and that I didn't criticize enough games. If you have any games for me to criticize, please post a comment, or e-mail me or somethin'.      How many of the readers have played  Halo ? To those of you who have, so you're in a campaign with a teammate, and you have low health, so you have your teammate shoot you (or hit you on the back) so that you regenerate with full health, right? Imagine for a second, a S.W.A.T. team or military squad' of sorts performing this procedure and others that are performed in  Halo .     Sarge : OK, let's go.   John : Hold on, I'm low on health.   Sarge : Sigh, Pete' take John into that room away from anyone and shoot him. Make sure you use the plasma rifle; we can't waste any of that precious assault rifle ammo.   Pete' and John leave the room.    John   from the other room : I'm too good-looking to die!   Pete   from the other room : Sarge! John isn't regenerating! Are you sure there aren't any terrorists around?   Sarge : Sigh.   Pete : Did you just say 'sigh' sir?   Bill : "No Terrorists", ya had to open your mouth!   Sarge : Ugh, I hate hearing that line, I'm killing Bungie for it.       Another thing is Real-Time Strategies, the unit responses when you click on them. Man, they're so realistic, I bet Westwood talks to people from the army and asks them, "What do you say when your commander gives you an order?" And the guy replies, "I usually like to say 'This gun is heavy' over and over again. I never get tired of it."       The great thing was that  Command & Conquer  music. It was always great. No, seriously.       OK, I take that back. But the only time  Command &amp; Conquer  music  wasn't  good was when the composer thought that smooth jazz or island music would go well with napalm and hand grenades.       In  Red Alert  though, there were some ridiculous weapons. First of all, the unrealistic weapons such as chronominers and mirage tanks and that business (you know the game started out as 'what if Hitler was never born'?), but then there's the just plain stupid weapons like parabombs. You'd think they'd want to speed up the fall of a bomb, but Westwood, they think differently, they actually slowed it down. That might actually do something for spreading lots of bombs out on a windy day, but it barely does anything with only five bombs. And obliterates the concept of accuracy. Why not just make a bomb that whistles while it falls (like those footballs with John Elway on them) and has the words 'Sincerely, Dubya' painted on the nose instead?        "All I want in the next  Red Alert  is dolphins with fricken sonars on their heads, is that too much to ask for?"    (There actually were dolphins with sonars on their heads in  Red Alert 2 )       Original  Command & Conquer  (also known as 'Tiberian Dawn'), greatest game ever. Had many pros, like weird storyline, an intro', a sneak peak at all fifty games that Westwood was working on at once including  Tiberian Dawn 's sequel,  Tiberian Sun . Also had its cons, like extremely pixelated graphics; as a result, whenever the commando spat (which was his 'idle animation'), the spit was the same size as his head.        Sarge : Take that Daemia!   Daemia ate Sarge's rocket!    Sarge : What the hell?   Narrator : Three frag's left!   Sarge : Who said that?        Command & Conquer: Generals , the dozer, he says some pretty stupid things. "Made in the US of A." Seriously, who says the prepositions out in an acronym? If you say, "US of A" instead of "USA", why don't you say "As S as P" instead of "ASAP"? I actually am willing to bet you, that unless EA Pacific (formerly Westwood) reads this and foils my plan, they will have the dozer say, "As S as P" in the next  Generals .       Some day soon, a guy at EA Pacific is going to say, "We should have the Crusader tank say '10-4' whenever you tell him to go somewhere", and someone will reply, "Isn't that a truckers' thing?" "No. It's an army thing." And none of them will realize that Google is a just a few clicks a way.       Speaking of truckers, Modest Mouse wrote a song called  Trucker's Atlas , which inspired Amir to want to go into truckering for a little while after college. It'd be fun, if I could tag along, and program better games while we drive, see the  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions  (which actually adds up to trillions) of sights. The song is one of Modest Mouse's best, except it's really long; in fact, a trucker could probably go from Washington to Florida before it's over. But go hear it anyway.       Sometimes one looks at these games and each of its little details, and one thinks, "Man, someone was assigned to that task." Imagine working at Bungie and your boss says, "OK, you, you program the gun moving while the player's walking. And make it move  more  while running." Sometimes you can tell who did the programming too. Like in the  Tiberian Dawn , you can tell that the boss' five year-old programmed the harvester pathfinder (which, apparently, is different from the regular unit pathfinder); you can also tell that they used the same pathfinder in  Red Alert . We have reason to believe, however, that the chronominers (which automatically transport themselves back to the refinery) were invented because they didn't know how to program a better engine.       Just kidding, no offense EA Pacific.       What's ridiculous is games where explosive barrels are spread out across the base. In Doom 95, the barrels of explosive poison were actually strategically placed, as if they knew that they would accidentally open the gates of hell and there'd be a demon standing right there. Who hides behind a barrel anyway? Apparently when you go to hell you leave your brain behind.   Another thing Doom 95 had was pools of poison. Makes you wonder what the UAC really was doing on Mars. Maybe it was just a side project, rodent repellent or something.        "I'm sorry ma'am, your husband died; and his body melted into the ground so the graphics didn't get too laggy."      In  Civilization III , it's funny because what do you do to solve riots? Give them entertainment.       "As you can see, here in Boulder near CU, there's another riot of underage drinkers demanding alchohal. The police are taking a different route to stopping the crazy CU students, they're sending in the clowns. They figure, if it worked in Sid Meier's  Civilization III , it should work here. And the clowns have special flowers that shoot tear gas."       In WarCraft III it's funny, the entire orc horde consists of eight grunts.       I would try and mock The Sims and the way they talk, but that would just get me killed.       Maybe I should have gone for quality of joke, rather than quantity. Oh well, I'm not redoing this thing.

      If you're ever forced to go to a dance, for whatever reason, and you don't want to dance with anyone, here's a plan that (theoretically) won't fail:  Attach a remote-controlled buzzer to your mom (you can attach it to anyone, but for this example I will use your mom), and whenever someone asks you to dance, set off the buzzer and your mom will make some sort of noise; either of shock or of pain. At that point yell, "MOMMA!" and run to your mom, leaving the person asking you to dance behind you.  Of course, this plan probably won't work more than twice. But if more than two people ask you to dance, you should consider yourself lucky.

      There needs to be a limit on what can be advertised on TV. Tampons, diahorrea, breast enhancement, Viagra, and anything period-related, just to name a few.  First, the Viagra ad's are really annoying, but then when I have to explain to my little cousin why everyone is smiling, well that just makes it worse.  Tampons I hate when they say stuff like, "It's sooo comfortable. It's like riding a bike." And they have disgustingly detailed (yet still vague) illustrations.  Breast enhancement mostly just because it's awkward when my parents are in the room and it says, "Increase the size of your breasts in half an hour!"  And then I'm watchin' TV one day with my family, then comes on this ad' with three girls at a beach and one says, "You're wearing a bikini during your period?" Then it goes into a series of things like, "Aren't you worried about bloating..." UUUGGGHHHH.  Now, those Geico ad's, those are funny. Like the one with the gecko doing the robot. Or the one that looks like a soap opera, and the guy says, "I've got some good news." Then the girl responds, "You broke up with Jessica?" "No, I just saved over 15% on my car insurance," she walks away, "I saved! I thought that meant something to you!"

      Those of you who like to eat ice during the summer because "It's refreshing," be warned: eating ice takes the enamel off your teeth.  And when you bite into ice cream with your two front teeth, every single person of the six billion on the entire planet will laugh at the expression on your face all at once and the noise will be so loud the vibrations will start earthquakes and destroy all of the major cities, and all of the minor cities, and pretty much anything really, and all the tall buildings on the planet will fall and since there are more tall buildings in New York City than anywhere else, when they all fall, the entire planet will be thrown out of orbit in the opposite direction of New York City and we'll be floating in space until either we: a) freeze or b) fly into a star or another planet  And  that  won't be very refreshing.  Stop eating ice.

      You know what'd be funny? If there were these two spies, and they put this tracking device on this guy, and they're tracking him via their spiffy computer equipment, and he's not moving, and one spy says to the other, "Where'd you put the device?" and the other replies, "On his shirt, why?" "Did you ever think, while you were doing it, that maybe he would eventually change his shirt and the device would come off with it?" Then they'd probably just laugh and get over it, but who knows?

      Don't you hate it when you ask someone a question, and they don't answer? They just remind you of things that might tell you the answer-- or just call you stupid.   Me : "What's the diameter of the earth?"  Bob : "Well what do you think?"  Me : "If I thought, I wouldn't have asked the question."  Bob : "Remember in science class, when Mr. Vierling was talking about the diameter of the earth?"  Me : "Well obviously not, because I wouldn't be asking you now if I knew what it was."  Bob : "'Member in that movie with Tom Hanks? They were arguing about the diameter of the earth."  Me : "Do you know the diameter or don't you?"  Bob : "And they were talking about how the diameter from pole to pole is smaller than the diameter from equator to-- other equator."  Me : "Just tell me the damn diameter!"  Bob : "7,800 miles."  Me : "Thank you!"  Exeunt   And then there are the people who are overly paranoid.   Me : "What's the diameter of the earth?"  Bob : "Why, what have you heard?"  Exeunt   P.S. As far as I know, there wasn't a movie in which Tom Hanks was talking about the diameter of the earth.

      I bet he comes on sometimes and just reads 'em for kicks. Not that his omniscient self doesn't know what he's reading before he "sees" (with his entirely intangible being) the word, but he might, like, focus on it and just laugh. Then again, how would an intangible being do something like laugh? Isn't laughter something that is by definition a certain physical expression of a certain emotion? Maybe Jesus laughs (as opposed to the father or the holy spirit) o.O, but that's only plausible if you believe in that whole holy trinity thing. Even if he couldn't express his "feelings", that doesn't necessarily mean that he can't be aware of it. I confused myself and forgot my point... again. Fuck.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Every war movie  absolutely must  have a scene where mud is flying everywhere from mines and bombs and such, and there's this guy who's squinting from dust everywhere, then his face straightens out as if he had suddenly realized tht everyone around him is dying and he's trying to find some profound, sentimental sort of thing to think. And then the carnage is showed in slow motion, and there's some slow sort of choral type of music, or else a single violin playing slow, slow scales; and everything's quiet except for echoes. And the echoes don't just echo anything, it's selective echoing; When the main character, who's really buff, stubs his toe, it echoes for five minutes, and they show the look of pain on his face, but when a generic private gets his head blow up by a friendly artillery shell, there's not a sound.   If I ever was in a battle, I'd wear a handlebar mustache and a bushy wig. I figure we'd all have a laugh, a couple cold beers (or the beverage in fashion for that particular time and place at whatever temperature it tastes best at).

      From now on, I shall no longer say grace before meals, instead, just before I die, I'm going to say the following:  "Bless us our lord, and these, thy gifts, which we have already received from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen. And may the souls of the faithfully departed, and the about to faithfully depart (me), through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen."

      My theory is that because 'septic' sounds like the Latin word 'septem', it must be related. It probably was the word for "The seventh element". If you forgot what the other elements are, they're Water, Wind, Earth, Fire, Love, and The Abilitiy to See Dead People.

      So, I was walking from the Kendall T Stop here in Boston to this pizza place called Emma's, which is really good, by the way. And I see this sign that reads something like "Lost Cat. Reward $600". The first thing I thought was damn, that's a lot of money. Then I thought, aww, what a cute cat. Then I thought, my cat's not really cute at all, she's old and fat and balding and getting stupid and mean. I would probably pay less than $50 reward for her. For 600 bucks, someone might actually spend time to look for a cat like that... Then it hit me!  Why not make semi-absurd sign that offers a massive, but realistic reward for something either incredibly common or incredibly hard to find. And so I visualized this sign in my head that read something like "lost possum. $300 reward" and I started giggling to myself after imagining a guy looking for a possum to bring me for his $300. What a fool he would be. Then my thoughts grew more humorous, to me anyway, and I began to think about putting Lost [x] signs up for things that are by definition fixed. Like "Lost Oak Tree. Last seen on the corner of Arlington and Main. Has 'I [heart] Shirley carved in bark' and 'Scott & Tiffany forever' etched inside a heart on the other side. Reward $400 cash." And then I would have the whole thing set up with a hole in the grass on one of the corners of the intersection about the size of a tree's trunk. Oh, how fun that would be. I mean, beyond a certain extent, it's not very funny, but I think it'd be very funny to see a Lost [x] picture like that... Or where the reward was something useless like "Reward 30 Twinkies" or something.  This was a waste of time, but it made me giggle. On an unrelated side-note, on that trip to Emma's, I found a 20 dollar bill lying on the ground and had a hard time deciding whether or not to take it. I ended up taking it after my dad said "God, Feanor, just pick up the damn money. Finder's keepers in these situations. If you don't pick it up, someone else will. It's not like the guy will come back and get it." That was 110% irrelevant.  That is all. -- Feanor

       Spiderman 2  at the 50 cent theatre, nothing better. Major plot spoiler:  Spiderman dies!   You see, Spiderman, along with his webspinning and wall climbing abilities, he also aquired the ability to bite people and turn them into spidermans (or spidermen, whatever) too. Kinda like a Count Parker. Near the end, Spiderman goes to a Lakers game with Mary-Jane, and after they win, Spiderman bites Shaq on the neck. "Doc Ock" picks up a gun and aims it at Spiderman. Spiderman (or 'Spiderman' as I like to call him) uses his web to spin himself a bullet proof suit, but he spends too much on the crotch support and Doc Ock shoots him. I know what you're thinking, "But Spiderman didn't die in any of the comics, therefore he's immortal!" Don't send e-mails with lots of swear-words to the messenger, I'm just telling you what I saw. Oh, and Mary-Joe gets married (get it?!?1 MARYd?! HAHA I KRAK MISELF ^!!?!?1.,.,111tgvags).  Also, it's fun to read the credits at the end because sometimes they have really funny names. Like there's this guy in special effects, his name was Dr. Krakohedovich, and everyone cracked up as soon as they saw the name-- I mean, what doctor goes into special effects?! Haha! BTW, does anyone know who played Bobby-Joe?  Good news though, there's going to be a  Spiderman 3  and Shaq's in it!  Sincerely, Andresman  P.S. i wundr if spydrman nos how 2 swingdance (get it?!?! SWING!!?! i MadE A JOke!?!?!1!?,.  P.P.S. From now on, I shall no longer known as 'Peter Pan', I am 'Peter Parker'.  P.P.P.S. Why was the burrito place closed? Fourth of July doesn't apply to Mexicans-- but I guess if I follow that logic, I shouldn't take the day off either, I'm British/Chinese.

      I'm going to start a new acronym to be used in IM app's like AIM, the acronym shall be LIQ ( L aughing  I n  Q uiet). It shall be used either for those laughs where it's not really a laugh, it's just a puff of air generally interpretted as laughter ("heh heh heh"); or those laughs where you're laughing on the inside. Basically you're not really laughing, you're just saying to yourself, "That was a good joke."    As well, I'm going to go up to someone, ask them, "Do you know what 'ASAP' stands for?" they'll reply, "As soon as possible," and I'll say, "Just a simple 'yes' or 'no' will do." Then walk away.    I've never been good at threatening people, so, until recently, whenever it came time for a threat, I would just use someone else's threat. Well "Expect a beating from a certain girl with short hair and glasses" isn't a great threat it turns out. I thought it was good when Megan used, I don' know why it worked then and not now.

      I just got back from a birthday dance. It was fun, I danced with a total of three girls, I danced about six times, for a grand total of two moves (swing basic, waltz basic). After quite a while came the time for the cake, they turned down the lights, Pat asked, "Why are they turning the lights down?" I was tempted to say, "So the ugly girls have a chance to dance," but I figured I probably shouldn't. They weren't any ugly girls there anyway; it's bad enough to call an ugly girl ugly, but to call a pretty girl ugly...  While I was standing outside, George, the brother of Margie (the birthday girl) came outside and said, "I hate it when that happens!" I said, "What?" He said, "I got a burrito in my pants." I looked at his knees and there was a lump and a wet spot from the sour cream and salsa. What's funny is that he said it as if it's happened before.  At the house they had some pictures of Bush dressed up as a fighter pilot with some real pilots, and the first thing Charlie notices is that they're all wearing cups. I think wearing cups is a perfectly reasonable thing-- what, with all the triple a's and the missiles flying at you all the time, you need some protection*. You don't want a SAM, or God forbid, a SCUD (just in case you accidentally hit one on the way) in that particular part. Plus, according to movies, the joystick is right in that special spot; if you slam on the brakes really quickly, that would hurt.   *"Ma'am, you husband was shot down, this is all we recovered of him."

      Why did they pick arrows to go with bows? If you put a row of weapons out consisting of a sword, an arrow, and a flail, we all know the person will go for the sword or flail. Most likely the sword. Why? Because it does more damage. So why not fire swords out of bows?

      Next time I hear someone play an instrument before me, when they've finished I'm going to say, "You're really good." Then later, if they ever bring it up again, maybe say to their friends, "[Insert my name here] thinks I'm good at the piano," I'll just say, "It was a metaphor."
