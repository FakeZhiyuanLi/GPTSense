      I know I'm coming off like an alcoholic and I know I'm not I swear to you all dear readers or reader? I am a failed drag queen that's bitter with the world and sometimes I think that is all I'll ever be. And that's okay with me because we are all going to be all right. Right? As you may notice from these two previous sentences I am now capitalizing all my "I's". I guess I just want to take this blogging thing a little more seriously. So yes, I awoke with a huge hangover at Fifi's today. We went out drinking in the design district. Me and my beatches. Only 4, including me. So when we finally got up(2:00) Fifi's mother made us waffles and then we went to Wal Mart. The homestead Supercenter Wal Mart that has every fucking thing you can possibly think of. The moment you enter it's almost like being in a Sci-fi  movie. How big can our stores get? So me and Fifi and her mommy and hangovers like you just hit Nirvana and this huge whiteness. Have you ever had a hangover like that? Your head doesn't really hurt but everything seems crisp and calculated and the world makes sense and everyone is beautiful. I know I'm fucking special to have hangovers like those. But let me tell you, it seemed like the world was there. I'm seriously gonna fucking stop drinking. I was floating in Wal Mart and everyone was on the ground. Tomorrow I'm going back to the beach I've been hanging out too much in the mainland.

      Yesterday i was sitting in with a Vocational school counselor that told me she had just bought a home in Homestead. I told her I had a girl friend that lived in Goulds. She was a hot councilor. She was from Boston but looked Dominican and she had that body too. She was yummy. She said she went to a church in an area that is still probably considered Goulds. Then as she kept yibber yabbing about how I could end up paying back my loans after I graduate and that it's a small sacrifice, to get into $7,000 dollars in debt for a six month course, because my certification would pay in the long run...but who thinks about the long run when you're broke right now and already in debt. But anyway, i recalled that last Saturday or was it Sunday morning as I came home tipsy but still capable of driving(DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE PEOPLE)...I did pass by that church where she goes...I was looking for some quick action and my beatch My Ling had told me she noticed some girls walking abouts in that area! So i was on the hunt...and i found one actually, it was two. One was falling apart like the Mona Lisa an resembled a zombie in the way she scurried and followed my car as a I slowed down. By the way, I own a Toyota corolla and its a hell of a car!....So as i was saying ...i kept driving and made a U turn. The zombie bitch had scared me but I was really horny and tipsy so I came back,....(did I mention I was there only to go sleep over at my girl friend's house? FIFI?) So I made a U turn on US1 and by 220....I slowed down and SAID "FUCK THE ZOMBIE!" Slowly, slowly, rolling...and...She looked good enough-the other one. I stopped and she got in and asked me if I was a cop. I said no and it was on!.I asked her how much for just head cause she was kind of nasty looking and she said $30 and then I asked her how about everything and she said $100 so i said cool and drove to a gas station to get money. The fucking clerk gave me an attitude cause he didn't want to open up and i was worried this beatch might just run off with all my CDs!...After i got the money she showed me where to park which was a a street behind the other side of the gas station and facing a church. (hint,hint, [insert irony here]) So i get a good look at her face and settle for just head but she seemed kind of upset and i figeted with the money in the dark and gave her forty....She pulled down her tub top and i started playing with her tits and she pulled my pants down and put a condom on my cock as fast as any hooker could and proceeded to give me head. I was not in drag but had mascara. She sucked until I came which wasn't long...I was kind of lonely and weak that night. I gave her my dirty talk as she sucked. She didn't seem too interested. "Can I get a tip at least?" And i'm thinking hell no!...But I say, "I gave you forty" She leaves my car and slammed the door.I waved and decided to go to my poppy's house in  little Havana...It took me an hour all the way from fucking homestead. When i got home I tiptoed to my old room. My underwear was cum stained and i proceeded to take it off when lo and  behold, there is a wad of fucking gum stuck to my pubes. Motherfucker. That fucking whore. As soon as  I start to try to get it off my drunk father is trying to open the door. "What you doing there?!"?                    "Nothing daddy! I wanna go to bed!"                    "What the fuck is going on!"                      "Nothing, go to bed," I say, as i rip my pubes like a mad man. It didn't begin to hurt until the next morning. That is the last time i pick up a whore in Homestead. Mark my words. And i'm still not exactly sure about vocational school.

      I have to fucking write this all over again. This the beginning but i have to start a few weeks back at Fifi's birthday party. We were there and it was all a bunch of dicks and Ike disappeared into a bedroom with his ex after whispering in each other's ear on the couch. And i danced with a girl that wasn't oval but round and wide and had a security guard uniform and was apparently on  her break and she fell on top of me and I'm on the floor in the gutter trying to look at the starts but only the ceiling!....And Mary misery left because her dead beat husband who is a stripper kept calling,....or did she leave because she didn't want to be there? She said,"Fucking sell outs!" ...I didn't leave because i started dancing with a hot Jamaican bitch. She left me and then before i knew it i was on the floor and this huge girl was on top of me....and my friends took photos......and God how I wish i was Britney Spears.....and that's my beginning....on the floor looking for the stars and no i wasn't on drag.

      Okay, okays, so Rhonda's been in a coma. But she's about to break out!...Break out!...O how I love third person...It keeps me grounded and let's you step out of yourself. But anyway, isn't South Beach just simply horrible now?? That place used to be soooo CHIC? It used to have personality and now it's just like a LA on Xanex. Yuck!...Oh well, what can you do?....Catch you later then...or to be continued.
