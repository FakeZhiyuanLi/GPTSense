      Hi! It's me again! Well, today is about the same as yesterday, except for one small detail.....I'm cleaning!!! Yes, be very afraid....SHANNON IS CLEANING HER ROOM!! Please refrain from dying of shock at the mere idea of me having clean living quarters. Besides that, everything's been quiet. Ah! It's cold outside! It was warmer during Fall Break! Darn the weather! Ah well, it could be worse... OOh! I'm having people over Saturday for DDR!!!! I can't wait!!!! And I get to see a certain someone else who I miss very much (ain't sayin who though, but you know who you are). And besides cleaning, I'm going to start exercising again today. Hehe, about time too, I'm gettin flabby again! Well, that's all I've got for right now. (I can't write as much about my day as Chelsea can..lol) Well, ttyl.

      Hi everyone! Today's about the same as yesterday, with one small exception....I'm cleaning my room...yes, SHANNON IS GONNA HAVE A CLEAN ROOM! Please refrain from dying of shock at the idea of me having clean living quarters. Besides that, today has been pretty quiet. It's cold outside today! It was warmer than this during Fall Break! Darn the weather.. Ah well, it could be worse, I suppose.  Ooh! On Saturday I'm having friends over for DDR! I can't wait! I get to see a certain someone who I haven't seen all week and who I miss very much (not sayin their name, but you know who you are!!!). Wow, I'm amazed at how very little I've got to say to the world today...can't type near as much as Chelsea, lol. Well, ttyl.

      Err- yeah. Today was PRETTY boring...lol. I got to watch alotta television, but that's about it. I think the most interesting part of the day was when I got to talk to Nick and Chelsea....I live a sad life, or so it seems. (lol) Ooh, this is my first post, so that's why it's so uninteresting!!!!...yeh, that'll be my excuse for today's post. Well, that's all for today...or maybe it's not..?

      hi again. How is everybody?  Today started off really good, and tended to stay that way for most of the day. I woke up, took a shower, got dressed, and waited for Cory to pick me up. Then we all went to the anime convention. It was fun, but I don't think it would have been nearly as fun if Nick wasn't there. He told me that I dragged him there! I feel so guilty about it! ah well. He made my day a whole lot brighter. ^_^  I bought a fan at the con, but I lost it! I must have set it down somewhere. I'm really sad about being so forgetful. It's rather frustrating at times. I don't know if I'm going to buy another one though. *sniffles* I feel so stupid for forgetting to pick it back up from where-ever I sat it down.  After Nick left, I started to feel physically ill. Not because he left, but just because I felt sick. So, around 4:30, I called my dad and asked him to come get me. He arrived at 5:15, by which time I felt a little better, and we went to Rosie's to eat. I didn't eat that much, I wasn't too hungry. Then me and my mom and Inky went to the mall to exchange the candle I bought her and accidentally broke for other stuff. I bought a disposable camera and a necklace.  We went home after that. I got on the computer, then called Nick. I believe he is frustrated. I was only kidding about fate being against us, Nick! That'd be terrible if fate really was against us, because I care for you very much. I love being with you, and no matter how long I am around you, the moment we're apart, it feels as though we haven't seen one another in days. I suppose that sounds a bit obsessed, but I don't care. That's how I feel. Chelsea, don't worry about April or camp. Everything will work out for the best. You'll see. And don't worry about you and Barry, I'm sure you two will stay together for a long time. ^_^ You need to stop trying to be paranoid like me! No one can be as good at being paranoid as I am, so don't even try. And I already know that I can't write nearly as much as you, and NO I wasn't counting my music list. hmph.... I'm kinda tired, but I don't want to sleep yet. It's a complicated thing. I've got alot on my mind, I suppose. The thing is, I don't know exactly what it is. It's like I'm supposed to be concentrating hard on something, and I don't know what it is that I'm supposed to be concentrating on. It's almost frustrating. Ah well. Tootles everyone!

      Today went pretty well, I do believe. Considering I was running on 4 hours of sleep, it went VERY well. I presented my project for Spanish today, which wasn't too bad. Hopefully I get a good grade for it, or at least an 80. If I don't, it won't make my grade drop too badly, because I had a 99 in there last nine weeks.  Second block we had an open book test. It was easy. Then me and Melanie discussed the times and such for Persacon!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait.  Third block.....I love Mr. Lewter! He's so awesome. I just wish that everyone respected him more. He's a good teacher, but nobody knows that cuz they never listen. Me and Chris Jones finished our work today and talked about DDR. He said he was going to play on my dance pad in the nude......scary images, I tell you. *sniffles* I'm gonna need therapy from that statement too....... ah well!  TOMMORROW IS ANIME CONVENTION!!!!! I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight, I'm so excited! It's going to be sooooooo much fun, and the best part about it is that I'm going to get to spend the WHOLE day with Nick!!!! or at least, I hope I am! His parents better not schedule out his day for him!! I'll be angry. Hehe, maybe I'll just come over there and kidnap him. That'd be funny, but I think that I'd probly get in trouble with his parents if I did that. I'm really bored right now, so that's probly why I'm still writing in this blog. Blogging always helps me eliminate boredom. Nick made me a Cake CD the other day, and I've listened to it 6 times already. I think I'll have some of the songs memorized before long. lol. hmm.......what else to write about. Chelsea writes EXTREMELY long blogs, in case anyone HASN'T noticed. lol, no offense Chelsea, cuz I like reading your blogs. and Nick! he doesn't write enough in his, by comparison. gonna have to beat him up, I tell you. Have you ever noticed that in the song "When you Wish Upon a Star" that Jiminy Cricket has a big range in his voice. I just listened to the song, and I don't have a range like that. My voice doesn't go that high!! lol.  Wow, my blog is getting conspicuously longer.....better stop, or I might beat Chelsea's longest blog...(though not likely) Love, Shannon "Don't ya wanna know why we keep starting fires?

      hi everyone......It's late! anywho, I just got back from watching Les Miserables. It was so friggin awesome!!!! I loved it!  Today was pretty good I suppose. I'm starting to feel paranoid about stuff again...which isn't good. When I say stuff, I mean how people feel about me. I think that I've always been a little paranoid about what people thought of me and such, but I just get worried. For example, I worry that I'm, for lack of a better word, smothering Nick. He told me I'm not, but that doesn't mean that I don't worry about it anyways!!!!! grr.... Two more days til Persacon!!!!!! *ish excited* Anyways, I've still got a project to finish in Spanish, so I'll probly be up later than usual. It's almost 11:30!!!!! Well, I'm off. Got things to do.

      hi all! ^_^ Today was pretty nice, I suppose. Not much happened though. I DID, however, wake up at 1:30 this morning and got up to take a shower, thinking that it was 5:30. Then I looked at my clock, thought it was broken, and went to talk to my mom, who had just woke up to answer the phone. Anywho, I went back to sleep, then woke up at 5:35, cut off my alarm clock, then fell back asleep. I ended up getting up at 5:50, took a quick shower, got dressed, and left the house. got to school...nothing very extraordinary happened. lol. gah!!! TIM'S GIRLFRIEND WAS TELLING ME ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO STEAL TIM FROM HER!!!!!! who would go out with Tim in the first place, let alone STEAL him from someone?!!!!! She said that she didn't think I'd try and steal him, and I was just in shock thinking......why would I steal HIM?I mean, I've got a guy of my own who I'm perfectly happy with, heh, got no business trying to steal Tim......*ish disgusted at the mere thought* I'm such a cruel person for saying such a thing.....ah well. ANIME CONVENTION IS FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!! It's going to be so much fun!!! anywho.....I'm going to go exercise now.

      hey everyone! It's me again. Today was a really good day. School was good, (didn't do anything all day) and then, after school, Chelsea and I took Nick home. He gave us a tour of our house. It's so pretty!!!!! *ish a wee bit jealous* eh, I'll leave. Maybe I'll kick his brother out and start living there......that probly wouldn't work out though. lol Anywho, it was reallly sweet of them to think that up, cuz I didn't know a thing about him riding home with us today. He just kinda hopped into the car. Then, after Chelsea and I went to my house, he called and said that he didn't have his notebook. So, we had to go to his house again. Not that I minded, lol. I mean, I really like him, so it doesn't bother me. ooh! we might go play tennis Thursday, me and Chelsea I mean. Maybe Nick could come too...??? *ish hopeful* hehehe... umm......................let's see, I think that's all for today. It was a really nice day.

      Hello everyone! or well, at least everyone who reads this blog. Anywho, today was pretty good. Got up, ate, took a shower, went to church. Chelsea spent the night last night, so she went with me. lol, she sorta got frustrated with having to wear a skirt. Then we came home, changed, watched Grease, ate, and Chelsea went home. I still haven't straightened up my room. The trundle bed is still out. lol! *ish a lazy bum!!!* anywho..... I couldn't sleep at all last night! It was driving me crazy! I stopped talking to Nick online last night, then I went to bed, (Chelsea had already fallen asleep) and then lo and behold....I couldn't go to sleep!!!!!! but ah well, I got to think of Nick, so it wasn't all that bad. lol. Actually, I think it was probly Nick's fault I COULDN'T go to sleep until maybe 2 this morning. but don't worry about it darlin, it doesn't bother me.   Anywho, after Chelsea left, I didn't do too much. made a meatloaf, watched The Sound of Music with Inky. pretty calm day, if ya ask me. actually, it was rather boring. Glad school is tommorrow. ANIME CONVENTION IS FRIDAY!!!!!!! *can hardly contain the excitement* I get to spend 2 days with Nick! and with other people too...but still!!!! I can hardly wait! hehehe...must be going now.

      hey everyone! Today was fair, I suppose. I'm really bummed out though.. well, I got up this morning, talked to Nick, then Chelsea, then took a bath, got ready to go to cyberspace cafe, then left. I got there, say, 12:30ish. I was supposed to meet Nick there at that time, but he got the pleasure of spreading straw all around the yard. so, he didn't arrive until 1:40ish. It wasn't so bad though. got to play checkers again Tuan and Colton. Tuan beat me, but I beat Colton. I just wish me and Nick got to spend more time together today. ah well... After that, me and Chelsea went to the movie theatre. 13 going on 30 was so hilarious! I loved it! The only problem at the movie theatre was that I spilled my drink all in the floor and on my pants. But that wasn't so bad.  We then went to the mall, I bought my mom $25 worth of candles and such from the Yankee Candles store. we then went to eat supper at Sbarro's.  Then we went to the sock hop for Girl Scouts. It was alotta fun. We went home after that, and I dropped my mom's candle!!!! I almost cried, cuz the glass is broken and such. I feel so STUPID!!!!!!!! *sniffles* eh, I'll live, I suppose.  Anyways, Chelsea's over right now, so I'm going to go.

      hi everyone....yesterday was pretty good. me and Chelsea had a campfire going after it rained, which was fun. But the meteor shower was nonexistant...Which was a bit of a disappointment. Oh! we had to use a diaper to light our fire, cuz the wood was all wet. lol, it was so funny! Today was alright...I guess. We didn't do much today, which was fun, BUT it was a bit of a disappointment as well. I sound like such a spoiled brat, but I just feel like me and Nick are cursed! I tell you, we're never going to spend any time together AT ALL!!!!! I've been on the verge of tears all afternoon after I got home and learned he wasn't going to the Exchange. I mean, it's not HIS fault, it's mine..I suppose I'm expecting too much. ah well, I'll get over it. I always do. ^_^; but I can't help but feel disappointed. I mean, I love spending time with Nick, and when I don't get to, it feels like someone offered me a present or something like that and then decided to take it away...sorry Nick! I'm not try to make you feel bad or anything. Tommorrow me and chelsea are going to see a movie. That'll be fun. I can't wait! haven't got to hang out with Chelsea much all week!!! I love spending time with you too, Chelsea! lol ^^ Well, must go. Love, Shannon "Happiness depends upon ourselves." Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC)

      Hi again. Today was average, I suppose. I woke up, went to school. Talked to Nick, then went to class. Club day was today, so I got out of class several times today. Came home via April, then called Chelsea. We talked for a while. I'M HAVING CHELSEA WITHDRAWAL!!!! I MISS HER!!! My mom hasn't let me go over there all week!!! It's so unfair *cries* umm...anywho...We didn't do ANYTHING in ANY of our classes today! It was great. Mrs. Hamlin came into our class to talk to us about setting goals. I've been thinking alot lately about what I want to achieve in life. I'm still not sure what I want to be when I get out into the real world. I was thinking about teaching American Sign Language and/or Spanish. I think that teaching in a deaf school would also be worthwhile. Basically, I want to make an impact on other people's lives.  I want to help others. That's why I do Girl Scouts, though in all honesty it helps me even more, I think. I know that the people who usually read my blogs already know that I want to leave my mark on the world. I suppose I just....I want to be needed......Is that being selfish? I feel so, for lack of a better word, useless. I feel as though I don't do anyone any good whatsoever. And I don't want to feel like that anymore. I suppose this blog has kinda went downhill in the amount of cheerfulness, and I apologize for that. I just have to express these feelings, and this is the only way I'm comfortable doing so. Tommorrow will be more cheerful, I promise....well, I hope it will be more cheerful anyways.

      Hi all! Let's see....today's Tuesday. Hmm.....what happened today.....eh, not much, to tell the truth. Lemme think. Well, today I went to school. I wore a more comfortable shirt today than yesterday, so my sunburn didn't kill me. Ooh! and I took 2 benidryl before class started, and half way through class I fell asleep, then during second block I fell asleep again, for the majority of class. I felt so lazy. I seriously think that in the long run I'm going to get skin cancer from gettin sunburnt so much. Ah well, hopefully I won't. umm, went to Lewter's class. Chris was kinda gloomy today, which is most out of character, for he's usually obscenely hyper and cheerful, at least towards me. (?) Ah well, I suppose if he wants me to know, he'll tell me. Nick, I love you! Thought I needed to throw that in there. Chelsea, I love you too, but not THAT way...lol. Well, I'll blog at you all laterz. That's all I got to say about my day.

      Hi all! How is everyone? My day was wonderful. I got to see my boyfriend, which is always a plus. We got our yearbooks back, and I don't look like an idiot. or at least, I don't think I do, lol, I might. Also, I got my Graduation Exam results back and guess what?!!!!! I PASSED EM ALL!!!!!! *ish extremely happy* We didn't do much work all day either, which is also very good. Ooh, I had to go to the nurse's office, cuz my sunburn hurt so bad today, and I got Aloe Vera rubbed on it. It felt so good. But anywho, I had my shirt pulled up to let the aloe dry and stuff, and a guy walks in! He was so embarrassed, but I was in too much pain to be care. lol. He was in maybe 8th grade, but I think probly more like 6th or 7th. Anyways, the patch of sunburn on my chest is itching really badly now. It's not even as bad as my back, either. I think I'm going to die from sun poisoning!!!! *cries* Well, gotta go and try and get rid of the itch!

      Hey everyone! It's me! Shannon! lol. It feels likes a century since I've updated, even though it was only yesterday. Anywho, not much happened today. I stayed inside most of the day, since I'm terribly sunburnt on my back and chest and arms. It hurts like the dickens. Ah well. It's 10:20 at the moment, just for the record. I also talked to Chelsea and Nick today. It was very fun. Oooh, and I got to watch Aladdin. hehehe. It's such a good movie...*ish a nerd* well, goodnight everyone.  Love, Shannon

      Hey!!!! I've been out of the loop for a good long while now. I just got home from Birmingham!!!!! I missed Nick and Chelsea so much while I was gone! Anywho, the trip was pretty fun. I felt a little left out, considering that I usually don't associate much with the people that were on the trip. They were really rather nice though, and fun to be around. Laura Clines got State Secretary!!!! Woohoo!!!!! *ish happy* Well, I'm going to go. Gotta dry my hair and get ready to go to the Renaissance Fair.

      Hey all. Well, today was very good. I went over to Chelsea's after school, and we got in the hot tub. It was fun! and then we went to Girl Scouts, and i got sat on by a buncha little girls. I almost suffocated! ah well, enough of that. I've still been doing alotta thinking, and I just can't get this outta my mind. I'm afraid that I'm going to die before I leave my mark on the world. You know what I mean? I-....well, I'm just afraid that I'll die and leave so many things undone, leave so many people unsure about how I felt about them. Probly just being paranoid...but still!!!!! I can't help it! I'm scared that when I die, people will remember me as the b*tch that only thought of herself. again, just me being silly. I know that people care about me. I guess I just need reminding sometimes. Blog at ya laterz. Love, Shannon What if you never let them know how much they meant to you?

      Sunday......Easter Sunday at that! wahoo! Went to church like I do every Sunday, came home and at lunch at grandma's. I ATE SO MUCH FOOD. Then I played Kingdom Hearts, and then talked to Nick for 41 minutes on the phone. After that, I went back to church. The last church service got me thinking though. I realize that I'm really afraid of dying. I don't know what to expect from death. I don't know where I'm going, and I'm scared I'm going to leave so many things undone when I die. I'm afraid that....well, that the people I care about will not know what they mean to me. And, I'm also afraid that I'm not doing anyone ANY good in life..afraid that I've let people down...of course, I haven't shared this with anyone until now. and also, I don't think that my sister likes me at all. I'm really scared that I embarrass her and that she hates me. I know I sound terrible and whiny, but it's how I feel. Guess I'm just a downer at heart. Course, I also got to thinking about how short and uncertain life can be, and how we should never take anything for granted, especially each other. It sounds corny, I know, but oh well. blog at you all later. Love, Shannon "Possessions dwindle; I mourn their loss.

      Hi all!  I would have blogged yesterday, but I was busy puking.....(thought you all might wanna know that). Anywho, yesterday was boring anyways. Today was okay though. Me and several people discussed a joking we're going to play on someone, so that took up most of the day at school. I gotta make sure I don't laugh though, or the jig is up. lol. I just hope that nothing bad happens from this joke. Ah well, I'm sure it won't. After school we went to Goody's and I got a shirt. It says "I make dirt look good." I had to get it! lol. Ooh, and we went to Logan's after that and the bartender accidentally shattered a glass, which flew into my food and on me. So, our food was all free. I really REALLY miss someone....and you know who you are. ^^ Well, blog at you all laterz. Love, Shannon "If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?"

      Hello Everyone! It's me again, the amazing Shannon..well, except that i'm not very amazing. lol!! Anywho. I'm over at Chelsea's today as well. We're about to go exercise for the day. She's showing me the pictures that she has from camp.  Today was pretty good. Actually, today was very good. I got out of 1st and 1/2 of 2nd block today because the entire 10th grade went on this field trip to Athens High School. It was pretty fun.  School was terribly boring though. The best part of school was probably break, cuz I got to see my friends. (especially you know who...*wink wink* you know who you are!!!) Well, I gotta go.

      Dear Losers who actually bother reading this very poorly written Blog,         I am writing this from over at Chelsea's house........My computer was acting stupid so we had to wipe it out. This started happening about Friday, so I didn't get a chance to post Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. It sucks,I know. I mean, I'm sure that everyone is obscenely interested in my life. You all are probably having withdrawal from not being able to see what's been going on in my life lately. So.......let's start with Friday then to catch up, shall we?         Friday: The first words out of my mouth were "OH CRAP!" You'd think that this would be a sign of a terrible day, but it was really good, after the yardsale.......Yardsaling mania!!!!!!!!!! WOOHOO!!!!!!!!(not really woohoo, but we'll pretend I had fun) Anywho, that was about 5 hours out of my life. I made $40!!!! Not a total loss, eh? After that, my mom came and picked me up, and we went to Rosie's Cantina and ate lunch. Then, we went and I got my hair highlighted!!! It's got almost platinum blond streaks in it now! It's so cute...I'm proud of it. lol! Ahem...after that, we came home, I called Chelsea, and she told me that there was some girlscout thingy at the pottery place. So, we went there. I painted a penguin!!!!! It's so cute! I get to see the finished product by next Monday. Some guy named Cameron kept flirting with Chelsea and me at that place, but other than that it was fun. OOh, and after that we went to the little fair in Huntsville in front of Books-A-Million. We rode the Ring of Fire.......IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!! I LOVE ROLLER COASTERS!!!!!!!! Chelsea was acting like she was scared stiff, but I bet she loved it too. lol.            Saturday: IT WAS SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, well, before my DDR Party it was a little boring, but once Chelsea arrived, the whole evening and night was awesome!!!!! Nick came over, so that made it worlds better. I don't think I'd have enjoyed the evening as much without him there. *sigh* lol, anywho.....okay okay, I'll tell ya, I got kissed!!!! *blushes* I'm a terrible kisser, but ah well. Zach saw us, and he freaked out like you wouldn't believe, but I suppose it doesnt' matter.             Sunday: Sunday was pretty nice, I suppose. We went to Wal Mart (me and chelsea did) after church was over. It was pretty fun. Chelsea got her hair cut!!!! IT'S SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^_^ She got about 5 inches cut off. While she was getting it done, I fell asleep in my chair..And for some odd reason, I was rudely awakened by SOMEONE(you know who you are.........CHELSEA!) clapping in my face really loud! It scared me so bad. I think I'll need therapy for it. After we got back from WalMart, I didn't do too much. I called Nick and talked to him for a while, then I called Chelsea and talked to her for an even longer while. We're planning out our exercise program. I can't wait to get started! YAY!!!!!!!!!!             Today: TODAY WAS WONDERFUL! I got to go back to school and see all my friends. Well, not ALL of em, but most of em. Adrienne started asking questions about me and Nick today....which was interesting, to say the least. lol. Amy doesn't approve of him, but ah well, she'll just have to get over it. Hehe, Chelsea told me that Amy could kiss my @$$ and get over it. (those were my thoughts exactly, too) Anywho, I think I've written quite enough for the moment. See ya all laterz.

      Well, today was a good day, much MUCH better than yesterday! I made some money...though I had to get up at 6:00 A.M. Grr.........anyways.. OOH! I DID make $40 though. I'm loaded! lol. No! you can't have any money! hmm, in other news, I went with Chelsea to this place called Pottery for you and Beads too! It was fun, though Chelsea took FOREVER to finish painting her clay figurine. The guy that worked there was 16, and he was flirting with me AND Chelsea (who is 19). lol. He found out she was 19 and sorta backed off after than. Of course, I didn't enjoy him flirting with me or anything. OOH! TOMMORROW IS SATURDAY! I'm so excited!!! I mean, overjoyed! wahoo! I can't wait! anywho, after we finished at the pottery place, we went to the ickle Fair that was in the Books-A-Million parking lot. We rode The Ring of Fire, and I got to hang upside down for 30 seconds over 60 feet in the air! The view of Huntsville was great from up there. LOL! Chelsea was so nervous about being up there though. I wanna go ride it again! I fear no ride! What I really wanna do is go to the Morgan County or Lincoln County Fair and ride all the scary rides there. I'll show everyone up sooooooooooo bad. hehehe..I love roller coasters! ooh and I got my hair done today. It looks so pretty..and blonde. lol, really blond. People won't recognize me tommorrow when they come over. It looks sexy *wink wink* MY COMPUTER IS BEING HOMOSEXUAL AGAIN! I think we'll have to wipe the memory on it out entirely and start over again. I'm writing this on my parents' computer. Well, I'm starting to write almost as much as Chelsea does. I might wanna stop before I write an entire book. Oh, and Nick, if you read this, I want ya to know something........I LOVE YOU!!! -- Shannon  "Pray for mercy from PUSS...and boots." --Puss 'n Boots from Shrek2.

      Hey hey hey! How is everyone? It's Thursday!!!! Meaning that there is only one more day until Saturday! Wahoo!!!! Anywho, today is again a quiet day. Last night I got scared cuz Lumpy was making rather odd noises that sounded like someone breaking into the house. Fortunately, it was only Lumpy. Dang, Chelsea writes waaaaaaaaaay too much on her Blogs. I can't possibly ramble THAT much. (lol, had to say it, Chelsea) My granny is sick today, and she took too much cough syrup, so she's been acting rather odd....err, extremely odd. Heh, she sounds rather drunk, if you ask me, or like she's got a hangover. If she's stop smoking, she'd be alright! But NO!! She won't listen to the voice of reason(Me)!! Ah well, she'll do what she wants no matter what any of us say. Ooh! my room is clean! I'm so proud, I almost wanna talk a picture so I can prove that it was clean at one point. Well, I must be going. Nothing to do, and all day to do it.  Love you all, Shannon "Everytime that I look in the mirror, I can't believe how awesome I am!" --Strong Bad

      dear friend, sorry for the lack of entries lately. I haven't had anything to write about, but I suppose I shouldn't neglect my blog any more than it's used to. Anyways..... I just got back from the movies. We went to see Van Helsing. I took someone with me. Yes, I suppose anyone who reads this on the regular basis would expect Nick to have been the one to go with me. Nope, wasn't him. Though, I was GOING to invite him to come with me. He wasn't home, so I asked Charlie. Nothing personal, Nick. I know you've got other things going on.  There was a tornado last night. The tree in the back yard on the property line got alot of the branches blown off. The tree beside our house has a big branch ripped down. Other than that, we didn't receive any damage. Though, all these people around us did. There were plenty of uprooted trees on Wooley Springs Road, as well as our road.  I'm afraid that the reason I haven't blogged much lately is because I'm becoming depressed, or I'm REALLY incredibly bored. I'm trying my best to get over it, but it's hard. I mean, all I've been wanting to do lately is sleep. Probly I'm just really bored and I feel isolated from my friends. I just wish I had someone to talk to over the summer, that's all. I'm not trying to put a guilt trip on anybody, I just felt like getting this out of my system. Ah well, I'll get over it. Sorry to bother everyone.  Umm, I promise to blog more cheerfully tommorrow. I will!!!! really! lol, tootles all. Love, Shannon Today instead of a quote, I'm going to pose a question. Anyone who reads can answer if they want. Just to get people thinking a little while out for the summer. Question: What are you most afraid of?

      hi Today was slow and tedious. alot unlike yesterday. But anyways, we went car shopping today, which wasn't that much fun. Car dealers can be such pricks. And I can't find a "nice" car. Though, we've found several cars in our price range which is $2,000. Not that much for a car, so I shouldn't expect too much from it. If anyone knows of a car that's not a piece of sh*t that is around $2,000, give me a call. Please? lol Other than that, we went to Wal-Mart(oh joy). I got LOTR: The Return of the King. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, though. Ah well, I will eventually. And I got this really cute pair of undies!!!! It's got the scorpio symbol on the front with the word "scorpio" embroidered on the front of the left hip, and then on the back it says the characteristics of a scorpio. It lists: perceptive, passionate, resourceful, magnetic, masterful on the butt on em. They're so cute! I just wanna show em off to everyone. But I won't, since someone would kill me for it. Ah well Chelsea's back in town! yippie! Though, she only came back to "pick up some things". Feh, I know she only came to see.....someone. hehe, I didn't say their name, so dont' kill me!

      Today was a REALLY good day. I got to spend nearly 3 hours alone with Nick at the Boy's and Girl's Club park. It was really nice. We haven't had a chance to spend time together since school has been out. Hopefully we'll get to go play tennis next week too. I mean, if he wants to, anyways. That'd be lovely. lol  Other than that, I haven't done that much today. I went to Inky's ball game, then Taco Bell, then Kid's Dugout. Came home, got a shower, got on the computer. Pretty easy day.  I can't stop thinking about this one certain person, and he knows who he is. Well, I'm off to bed now. Love, Shannon "Put your dream away for another day, and I will take their place in your heart.

      Hello. Today was dull. Terribly dull. and a little disappointing... but then again, maybe I expect too much out of everything and everyone. Well, I woke up at 9:30, and right after eating breakfast, started doing laundry. Talked on the phone for a few minutes, then started doing laundry again. Had lunch, then went outside and cleaned out the pool. I also pruned this big plant in my granny's flowerbed and push mowed half the front yard, as well as washed the car. Then I came back inside, and tried to call Nick in hopes that he would be able to go to Inky's ball game tonight. But lo and behold, he spent the night wtih a friend, which is fine. Ah well, at least he has friends to hang out with. Alotta my friends are guys, and I can't very well spend the night at their houses, that'd just be wrong. I'm sure me and you'll get to hang out some eventually this summer, darling. ^_^  After I called, my dad brought this Lincoln for me to test drive. It wasn't bad, just rather bulky and not so new. So, I had to go the store to buy newspapers and look in the classified section for used cars. In all honesty, I don't care anymore. After that, I started watching House of 1000 corpses. It was wierd! really wierd.. But then, Rob Zombie directed it, so I didn't really expect anything normal.  So, after that, it's off to the ballgame. 2 of em. They were okay. They won the first one, lost the second. So, then we went home, and here I am now.  Thursday me and Nick are supposed to play tennis,  if that doesn't get screwed up. Hopefully it won't.  I'm sorry about being such a pessimist lately. I'm just feeling kinda let down for some reason. Summer just isn't feeling like it usually does. I usually really like the summer, but now I wish school was back in session. Ah well, tootles yall! ^_^ Love, Shannon "In other words, please be true.

      Dear (fill in the blank): today has been good, I guess. Nothing to bad happened today. Just a bit boring.  Let's see, today i went to Ardmore to drop granny off at the drugstore and also to drop off Charlie's belt. Nobody was home at Charlie's, so I accidentally walked into his house that had no one in it. It freaked me out, so I scuttled out of there pretty quick. Then I went to CyberSpace and picked up a sandwich for granny, went and picked up granny, got some gas for her car, and went home.  I watched these wierd movie called I Posed for Playboy. Actually, (and this is going to sound really wierd) posing for playboy looked kinda fun. lol, I mean, I don't wanna get naked and let people take pics or anything, but photoshoots in general look like they'd be fun to participate in. anyways, after that we went to Inky's ball game. Nick was going to go, but he had a dentist's appointment. hahaha! Though, in all seriousness, I dunno if he really wanted to go chill out at a ballfield anyways. Not that I blame him.  I'm trying to diet and exercise now. I'm cutting out all carbs and sugars that I can, only I suppose I'm doing so gradually. Ah well, that's what I get for being so darn fat!!!!  There's not much else to talk about now. As I said, dull day. Well, tootles all. Love, Shannon "Come into these arms again and lay your body down.

      Dear whoever reads this: Today has been somewhat dull. Went to church, went to Logan's Roadhouse, then Sam's Club. Came home, went back to church, then went to Coulter's house to pick up House of 1000 Corpses. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, though. anywho, after that, I mowed the grass around the pool, hacked down a wild rose bush and a small tree. Then I pulled a pine tree out of the ground. I was really quite proud of myself, tell ya the truth. Then I came inside and took a bath, then went to Ardmore to get something to eat. We got back around 10.  I don't know what's up with me anymore...I feel so sad and listless, and I'm always wanting to sleep, but I'm not sleepy, or at least, i shouldn't be sleepy. It's an odd thing, really. And I'm always feeling like I'm about to cry. I don't show it all the time, but it's still there. I HATE SUMMERTIME!  Maybe tommorrow will be more fun. I don't get to go play tennis with Nick tommorrow, though I bet he wasn't going to be able to, anyways. Either that or he forgot to ask his parents. *big sigh* Ah well... I'll talk to you all tommorrow. tootles. Love,  Shannon "When I want rain, I get sunny weather. I'm just as blue as the sky. Since love walked out, can't get myself together.

      hi everybody.  Today was pretty good. We went to go see Shrek2 today! It was so funny! I agree, Chelsea, I dun think I've ever seen a better sequel. oh, and do you think that Elmer will be a good name for your plant? I think it'd be cute. Either that or Ping. Ping is cute too. And it's a brand of golf clubs. lol. Anyways, it's late. I'll miss you this summer, Chelsea, but I do hope you have fun. Tha'ts what's important, well, that and making money! lol, I'll guard Barry for ya, make sure he doesn't get too flirtatious with other girls. gotta go to bed now, tootles all! ^_^ Love, Shannon "Fire in the Disco!"--Electric Six

      I just got done exercising!!!! I'm so excited now! At 9 I got back from Graduation. That was really fun. I drove to Chelsea's and got there at 3:30. Then we went to Cyberspace cafe to drop off a DVD that I accidentally left in the DVD player. Ah well, can't complain, I got to see Nick once more. He didn't really pay that much attention to me, but I'd seen him earlier today and we had talked earlier and stuff, plus he was playing Quake, which is fine. I mean, he doesn't get to go chill with his friends that much, so I can't expect him to drop everything just for me ALL the time. Umm, not that I expect him to EVER drop everything he's doing just for me. That wouldn't be right.  lol. I'm in such a good mood now that I've exercised.  I don't think anything could make me mad at the moment. We went to Dairy Queen after graduation, and got a salad (good) and ice cream (good, but bad for ya). Then we dropped Randall off at Joe's, then I drove home. Two horses and a guy ran out in front of my car!!! I had no idea what it was. I was SO glad that I wasn't going more than 40 mph, or I might have hit one of em. That wouldn't have been good at all.  So yeah, that's about all that's happened since my last blog.  Tommorrow I'm going to Chelsea's house and DJ's, then on Saturday we're going to see Shrek2!!!! I can't wait!!! Ah well, I suppose I'll HAVE to wait, won't I? woohoo! okay, I'm shutting up now Love, Shannon "In the wee small hours of the morning, that's the time you'll miss him most of all."

      Today has been pretty good. Can't complain.  Went to Ardmore, ate at cyberspace cafe, saw Nick. Yup, fairly good day.  I'm going to graduation tonight, which will be fun, I guess. I wish Nick would go to it though, even though he says he doesn't know anyone graduating. I'd at least get to see him again. (I'm sad, I know. lol) Ah well, can't have everything we want....can we?

      okay, first of all, I'd like to apologize for being so down and out earlier. Today was a little odd. But I'm better now. Me and Chelsea figured out that I was having a panic(or anxiety) attack. Yup, that's what it was. But now I can't catch my breath, and it's bothering me. I talked to Nick, and I'm now thoroughly convinced that my worries about him were for nothing. I love him so much, and I hope he knows that.  As for Chelsea, I'm happy for her being able to go to camp this summer. Even if it means that I don't get to see her for a while. I was just worrying over nothing. And I'm also glad that her and Barry have started going out.  Well, that was my first panic attack. I don't know if I want any more. lol, okay, well, I definitely don't want any more panic attacks. They're not very much fun. Well, I'm going to bed down now.

      hi everyone..... I don't know what's wrong with me today. I went to get my license, and I got it. I was really happy about it, but now I'm just so down and out that it's not even funny.  We're out of school now, and I'm supposedly happy about it, but I don't feel very thrilled about it at all. It's a funny thing. I'm so close to tears right now, and I don't know why. Being depressed really sux. I was really depressed earlier this year, but got over it, but now I feel depressed once more. I don't know why!!!!  Chelsea and April are going to camp soon. I won't see them until school starts back. Hell, I probably won't see Nick until school starts back, either. He probably won't care though. He told me otherwise, but I just get the feeling that I'm crowding him, that he just doesn't care to see me anymore. I don't know!!!!! It's really upsetting, and the worst part is, I have no real evidence to back up my feelings. I'm just too freakin paranoid. I know I shouldn't write all that and upset the people who read this, but I don't think they really read my blogs anymore anyways, so it doesn't matter. I just don't know what to do anymore. Summer is supposed to be fun!!!!! I swear, I'd rather be in school for the rest of my life. At least I'd be busy and have SOMEONE to talk to.  All I've been wanting to do this week is cry and sleep. Either sound appealing at the moment. I'm just being stupid, I know, but I can't help it. Gotta get this frustration out. I'm going to go now, and maybe I'll be in a better mood later today and post more.  Love, Shannon (no quotes today, sorry)

I haven't got any complaints....or at least, no REAL complaints. lol  This week has been wonderful so far. I can't wait for Saturday!!!!!! It's going to be so much fun. Though I do wish Barry could have come. Ah well. Charlie's coming! ^_^ He hasn't come to a DDR Party in ages!!! I don't have the heart to write a long blog today. Too much other stuff that needs doing.  Love you all! Shannon "Does it look like a Q to you? How about now?" Quagmire from Family Guy

      hi all. I haven't updated in a while. I haven't really had the heart to blog lately. not sure why, just don't have any inspiration to make an interesting blog. Actually, this week wasn't that amazing or anything like that. Just you're average week.  Truth be told, I'm not ready for school to be out. It's not that I enjoy my classes that much, it's that I don't want to go without seeing my friends for 2 months. I mean, I won't be seeing all the friends that I ONLY see at school, and I won't be seeing April or Chelsea AFTER school. They're both going away to camp for the whole summer. But hey, good for them.  The other reason I dun wanna be out of school is because of Nick. My luck, we won't see each other much over the summer. Though, if I had it my way, we'd see each other almost every day. lol, but I have a feeling that this won't be happening. The best we'd probly get would be once a week (?) Course, I'm pretty sure his parents probly wouldn't like we hanging out with him too much. Ah well. We'll work something out.  Thursday I played tennis with Chelsea, Nick, and Charlie. Jacob was going to play, but he didn't. He got there, then didn't play. I was almost offended. There were alotta annoying kids there, so we didn't stay TOO long. lol.  I also had a band concert Thursday. It went pretty good, if I do say so myself. Well, I have family over at the moment, (oh joy....) so this blog is going to stay fairly short.

      hi all! I didn't blog last night, I was too tired.  Yesterday: well, Saturday went pretty good. I went to the con, hung out with April and Sammy, then played Soul Caliber with Nick. I kicked his butt; however, I think he was letting me win. Ah well, it was lots of fun. Around 1:30, I left with April, Sam, and Garrett to go to the mall. I wore Garrett's Kenshin costume into the mall and walked around for a while. people kept staring at me. Oh the hilarity. After that, I went home, got ready to leave, and left for the band auction. It was soooooo boring. But it was rather interesting. Matt Hill's mom has been really sick lately, so I asked him about her. Then we ended up talking about our current situation. Me and him, as everyone who reads this knows full and well, haven't been getting along at all this year. Well, he somewhat apologized, gave me a hug, and then told me he loved me. I wasn't really sure how to respond. I mean, if he had done that the day after all that stuff occured, then I would have gladly accepted that things could get back to normal. But now, what was once normal between us will never be normal again, no matter how much anyone might want to believe that. I WON'T let anything like what happened between me and Matt ever happen to me again. I just can't. I mean, if it wasn't for the few of my friends who actually knew and cared about mine and Matt's falling away from one another, I don't think I would have made it through this year at all. I was depressed for probably 3-4 months, but sometimes nobody noticed, which was a good thing. I don't want to seem like I'm trying to get attention or anything. But, thanks guys for helping me out this year, I really needed it. I love yall! Today: Today is going pretty good, I suppose. I went to church, then went to Garon's to eat lunch. It's sorta odd, Garon's is now a family restaurant, but it used to be a bar!!! Anyways, after lunch, we came home, and I've been trying to straighten up my room. It WILL be clean!!!! ish certain of it! lol Last night: I had a really really odd dream. It was somewhat scary, except for the fact that I think it will never happen to me. Anywho, here it is.  In my dream, I was just walking around with someone, I don't remember who, I just know it was one of my friends. Then, someone else who looked suspiciously like Saddam Hussien jumped out of nowhere with some army type guys and attacked us! They tied us up and then told us about how he was going to blow up the nuclear plant, and they then sat us down in the middle of the nuclear plant, next to a few of my other friends who were all bound and gagged. I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID!!!! Then, they left, and we saw the timer for the bomb. The timer hit 00:00, and I heard an explosion, then woke up. I was just thinking, don't nuclear weapons basically make your skin melt off the bones? That would be a crappy way to die.  Coincidentally, the other day I was listening to the radio, and they were talking about nuclear weapons. Interestingly enough, they now make nuclear weapons that are ecosystem friendly!!!!!! HOW STUPID!! lol, " Why honey! of course this bombs kills thousands upon thousands of people, but they're environmentally friendly, so you can rest at ease." gah!!!!! Rediculous, if you ask me. Tsk Tsk people!  I've been thinking about the war on terrorism alot lately. It confuses me, so I have mixed feelings on it. Why are we fighting this war? I know that we have reasons for hunting down Osama Bin Ladin(can't spell) and Al Quieda for what they did to our country, but we don't seem to be getting anywhere. Every day more soldiers die. Just a few weeks ago, an army vehicle was blown to smithereens and some psycho Saudis were dragging a soldier's dead, charred body down the street! It's highly disturbing that things like that could go on over there. It really makes me thankful that the war isn't being fought over here. But when will all the fighting end? I know that there are some things worth fighting for, but when will we have what we want to achieve? Childish, pale questions I suppose, but they ARE relevent. I mean, I have friends who want to be in the armed forces, and I don't want to see them on the news being tortured or blown up. I just want this to be over. And I hope I don't sound unpatriotic or anything, because I love America as much as the next American. I just care too much about what will become of our country if the fighting doesn't stop. Will there be another draft instated, so that all men that are 18 or older get the pleasure of being forced to fight for a cause that they might not even believe is worth dying for?  All that I've said right there, I say because I have the right to, because I'm American. I appreciate and love my rights as an American citizen, and I'm NOT being unpatriotic. If you disagree with EVERYTHING I said today about our War on Terrorism, then please feel free to tell me so.  I'm off now, gotta finish cleaning my room. Sorry if this blog was so long, but I had to write all this down.  Love, Shannon "I might not believe a word you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."--Voltaire

      oh my goodness! It's been forever! okay, sorry guys! Didn't mean to neglect you or anything. I just haven't had the time to blog. Anyways.... Lately hasn't been TOO bad. I have my car and my cell phone, so I can go places without my parents tagging along. Which is fun. I'm starting to REALLY miss Chelsea. I mean, I missed her before, but I really REALLY miss her now. And Chelsea, if you read this, what weekend are you coming home? Cuz I need to know ASAP. Send me an email or call me at 777-1939 to tell me, please? thanks.  Okay, you might ask "What has Shannon been doing lately?" Well, I've been loafing around doing nothing and getting fatter. Yup, that's almost all I've done lately. I went and got a physical Friday. The doctor told me that I need to lose 60 pounds! That I need to way 120 or 130! umm, news flash....I'm 5'8"!!!! I'd be sickly and dead if I weighed so little. My goodness!  I took my ACT Saturday. I don't think I did as good as I was hoping to do, but I doubt I made a 2. maybe a 21, 25 at the best. Who knows. The thing is, I couldn't concentrate because I had a few problems with my dad that morning. But, there's not a darn thing anyone who reads this can do about it, so I'm not going to share. I'll have to deal with it on my own.  Anyways, Saturday night I had a DDR Party. Though, we didn't play TOO much DDR. We hasd a fire in a barrel, and we roasted marshmallows and sparred and played in the rain. Then we played DDR and got in the pool. Ooh! and me and Nick got to kiss in the rain! I've been wanting to do that since we started going out. I dunno why, I just really wanted to. lol Well, I've gotta go. So, I'll blog at you all later. I'll TRY my best to blog at least once a week from now on.  Love, Shannon "Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head."--Blink 182

      konnichiwa! O genki desu ka?  Anyways, now that THAT'S out of my system..... today was pretty good. I went to church, came home, watched Conspiracy Theory, talked to Nick on the phone, entertained my little 4 year old cousin, then went back to church. When I got home, I called Barry to chat, because I was bored. He asked if I wanted to come over and watch a movie, so I went over there. When I got there, we went to Bethel to rent movies. We watched Cold Creek Manor, but it was boring, so we turned it off. Then after a while we watched Evil Dead. To be honest, we were both rambling, so we didn't watch too much of it. lol. Then we went to check on the fires he had started before I got there. It was so funny because I couldn't see and there were alotta holes in the yard, so I had to hold his hand the whole time we were outside. I was half expecting Chelsea to leap out of the bushes and mug me for holding her boyfriend's hand. Of course, I also halfway expected NICK to leap out of the bushes and tackle Barry. But, it's not like either of us have feelings for each other. I mean, we both have someone else. lol, it's just that we never get to see them, so we end up talking to each other more than the people we're going out with. Don't worry, Chelsea or Nick! Barry misses you, Chelsea, and I miss you, Nick.....even THOUGH you don't really have an excuse, whereas Chelsea does. OOH! I forgot to get Barry's address for you, Chelsea! sorry! I'll get it tommorrow, if I can remember. Well, it's nearly midnight, and I'm pooped, bushed, fried, dead on my feet....whatEVER you would like to call it. So,I'll talk to everyone later! Tootles! ^_^ Love, Shannon "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam.

      Let's see here..... This week has been fair, I suppose. A little dull. but, guess what?! I GOT A CAR!!!! woohoo! It's a 95 Corsica, and it's white. It's my baby. lol. I also got a really nice cell phone. It's very pretty and shiny and new. Besides that, nothing has happened. I sleep, I eat, I watch Sailor Moon DVDs, as well as movies that I own. That's basically all that I've done the past four days. Ooh, but I DID go to Ardmore this evening. I went to April and Sam's to drop off DDR, then on to Ardmore to McDonalds and hung out with everyone there. Joe tried to get me to go out with Rusty. Though, he tries to get EVERYONE to go out with Rusty, so I'm not taking it personally. It was so good seeing everyone today, I've been so lonely this summer.  For some reason, I've been really ill ALL week. I mean, really wierd things trigger it off too. I just....I just want to say really hurtful things to everyone. well, not everyone.....just a few people. And these people don't do anything wrong. I'm feeling angry right now too, but I don't know why. Maybe I'm just in an angry mood and I need to let off some steam. Majorly pissed for NO reason. ohhhh, I'm just glad I didn't feel this way driving home.  Why can't I just have a COMPLETELY normal day for once, were I don't feel sad or pissed off?! ah, I'm cursed, I swear I am. Okay, I'll get over it, hopefully. anyways, gonna go now and calm down.

       I'm so confused...    &nbsp;  Should I be feeling so lost right now? I just feel like I don't know ANYTHING anymore. I can't help it. and, I know that not many people read this, but I still like to vent. It's like my little diary.    The thing is, I'm so unsure about me and Nick right now. He's told me so many times that he loves me and that he cares for me, and he seems to, and he has plausable excuses for when we can't be together. I  want  us to be together...SO MUCH! But, when it comes right down to it, we just can't. And, well...I think that I'm just now accepting it for real. We  can't  spend time together, outside of school. His parents won't allow it, because I'm older, I can drive, and we'd be alone. There's NO way they'd allow their son to be with me for very long, where they can't get to him in 2 minutes if that have to. And, being in this relationship will only tie him down, limit him. I don't want him to be tied down when we can't even spend time together. And I really don't think he wants to be tied down either. Don't take this wrong, I'm not saying that I want to break up with him, I'm just saying that, if he wanted us to, then it'd probably be for the best, because it would make him happy. Heh, funny, isn't it? I just wish that it was  really  funny to me. Because it's not funny to me at all.    I really REALLY wish that Chelsea was here right now. I really need someone to talk to. I've tried talking to April, but she doesn't know what to tell me, and if I talked to her any more about it, she'd probably not feel comfortable trying to comfort me. I just don't know what to do!!!!    Well, other than my relationship turmoil, I guess things are alright....a little dull, perhaps, but peaceful, none the less. I'll keep you all posted with what's going on in the wonderful world of Shannon.     &nbsp;  Shannon    &nbsp;  Question of the Day: If you could wish for anything, what would it be?

      Hey everyone. I've been gone all last week camping in Decatur. Well, we weren't REALLY camping because we were in a camper. but still, it was alright. A little on the boring side. well, ALOT on the boring side. I got alot of chiggers too. probably around 40-50. They itch so bad. and when we got back Friday from camping, we left Friday afternoon to go to Franklin, Tennessee to go to Inky's softball tournament. That was alright too, I guess. Also a little on the boring side. Band camp is next week. whoopie!......not really. I'm NOT excited about band camp. not at all.  School starts back in roughly 2 weeks. Which is good. It'll get me out of the house and away from all the food. The only bad things is that I'll have to get up early again. I haven't talked to Nick since Saturday, which makes me sad. We haven't seen each other in over 3 weeks. I think he's trying to avoid me. jk! but seriously, I was gonna invite him over Wednesday night, and I dunno if I'll be able to get in touch with him by then! He's never home, nor is he online. grr. Ah well. See yall all laterz.  Love, Shannon

      hi There hasn't been THAT much interesting stuff going on in the past 3 weeks or so. So, here's the few things that were mildly interesting. I joined the wellness center a little over 2 weeks ago. I go 4 times a week, if I can, and I work out for an hour at least. I don't know if I've lost any weight yet, but I have toned up a bit. Not many people have noticed it yet, but they will. Someday, I'll be really hot, and get all the guys. OR at least, they'll all WANT to get me, but I won't let em have me. lol jk yall. I'm not going to fool myself into believing any of that.  Me and Coulter went to Charlie's house 2 Wednesdays ago and watched 50 first Dates. Thus we went to Barry's house the next Wednesday and hung out there. lol. I think we might be going to my house this week.  Me and Chelsea and Charlie and Lacie went to go see Spiderman 2. It was SO good. Chelsea told me that me and Charlie were acting like a couple when we were at her house. This worries me a little, because I don't mean to be so flirtatious. Chelsea spent the night at my house that night.  Friday, I didn't do a whole lot.  Saturday, I was somewhat frustrated. I had some friends over to swim, and Nick was going to come, but he got into another arguement with his parents, which didn't do a thing for him but get him grounded. This in turn made me REALLY mad. I was so mad that I cried. and not just a little crying, but full on violent sobbing. I was just so mad, because it was the second time that had happened. I mean, the first time, I didn't care TOO much. But this time, it just made me think that maybe he didn't want to spend time with me anyways. I guess I should just believe him when he says that he wants to spend time with me. eh, I should just stop being so paranoid. Love, Shannon
