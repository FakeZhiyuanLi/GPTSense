       Wow it’s been a while. So much has happened lately. I’ve done and felt so many things I never thought I was capable of.  Work has been crazy. It’s insane how inconsiderate people are during a sale. They become vicious animals destroying everything in their path. Customers steal from each others carts, throw things on the floor, become totally irrational, and abuse random sales people all in the quest for a good bargain. What part of FINAL SALE do you not comprehend?!  After many long hours I finally had my first day off. Today offered no funerals or harassing morning wakeups to go back to that fluorescent lit supermarket with a supposed “heart”. Thank God. I did wake up extra early though to call Tim to wish him a safe flight and a good trip. ;)  So on my fabulous day off I watched the first season of “Sex and the City” and forgot how much I absolutely love that show. They incorporate everything I love about life all into a one hour episode, commercial free! There’s lots of high fashion, an amazing wardrobe, lots of sex, humour, and bare honesty. That show makes being single look so attractive and is so empowering to women. Wow I love it……  Tim left me for two weeks in Maine. He is such an amazing guy…I’ll miss him a lot. I think it’ll be good for him to get away from everyone and spend some quality time with his Mom. I wish I could leave my family like that, wow must be nice.  He is so good to me and everyday I can’t believe how lucky I am. I never thought relationships were for me, but everything feels so relaxed and comfortable. Did I mention I got flowers? Wow how totally sexy…..

         Well would you look at the time? Things can really change in the span of a half hour. So far I’ve gotten 1 pair of fabulous UGG boots (technically), 1 submissive parent, a ride there and back (WOOT!), and one French vanilla that would normally cause me extreme duress.     &nbsp;   Summer for me has finally arrived. 2 weeks of sitting in a class for 8 hours straight with a bunch of retards has come to a halt. I improved by 21% which no one thought possible (including my parents who agreed to buy me the aforementioned boots,&nbsp;ha!ha! to them :P) Here’s to week old hair, waking up at 2 in the afternoon, and all things summer (including tan lines). &nbsp;     &nbsp;   So lately not much exciting has been going on, I’ve worked about 21 hours this weekend at the hell hole aka FORTINOS. Some gaydoo complained that I bagged his romaine lettuce with his onion and it all got squished. He then proceeded to return all his groceries to the entirety of $247.63. Wow what a fuckhead. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   “Hey dear, let’s spend 3 hours grocery shopping on a Sunday morning, wait in line for half an hour, then return everything!!!!” sounds like fun………. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   So other than that I’m looking forward to doing nothing and enjoying every moment. Today started off first-class, I hope the rest of the week can continue being this good…better than 5 secound bacon. &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;    ON MY SCHEDULE:&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Happy one month Tim       urlLink  http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deathcabforcutie/passengerseat.html

       To my astonishment I woke up this morning with a little surprise on my neck. Thanks Tim, really appreciated. I can’t wait until my parents notice………..   I hate early wakeups more than anything. I hate that feeling when the alarm goes off and it felt like you just closed your eyes. Only one more day, one more day and I don’t have to worry about anything for six weeks, six goddamn weeks. Though fourty-two days seems miniscule in the lifespan of the average human, to me it means a lot. People and things can really change in 1008 hours.

       Alright, so I am totally computer illiterate, I'm surprised I actually figured this thing out. Lately I've been browsing all these cool journal sites and I picked this one because it seemed the easiest to understand and the most organized, but WHERE CAN I POST PICTURES?! Where's all the hot pink fonts? ARGH!   So how did my day go you ask? Pretty  normal  nothing out of the ordinary. Summer school is ALMOST over thank you fucking God. Two weeks of hell in a freezer surrounded by dumbasses is starting to get to me. Hopefully I'll get over 70% and get the lovely UGG boots my Mom has been promising, if THAT actually happens I'll eat my hat (shout out to Rob the Baker).........right.......   Did you watch Big Brother 5 last night? WTF is up with that chick Nicomis' hair, and btw WHO THE FUCK wants to be called "Jennifer aka Nicomis" hmmmm I wonder. She comes on the show with putrid purple hair and then dyes it green. "Nicomis aka Jennifer" then remarks:  "I like to express myself, my hair is creative...." Ookie there if that's what you call it. Such a pretty girl who unfortunately is walking around with cat piss for hair....   So enough of my bitter ranting,  I AM NO LONGER A FUCKING VIRGIN BLOGGER, HA! :P
