      I am reading William James' 'Principles of Psychology', written in the 1890s and thoroughly relevant to many debates about the relation between mind and body. It is refreshing to observe the way he weaves neuroscience with the kind of exhortation to personal development one might expect to find in popular psychology titles. He suggests that one should do at least one thing every day simply because you don't want to. Today I spent an hour beginning to tidy my study, with a gratifyingly reinforcing effect on my mood and self esteem.

      I am, as perhaps are most of us, struggling with integrating my values with my behaviour. In particular, I wish to be able to look at my everyday life and feel satisfied that I have lived each day to the full, and made choices (including the choice to keep to habits, which are choices that are held to over a period of time) that are in pursuit of my values. I am writing this far too late in the night, for example. This blog will be to some extent a personal confessional, although I aim to keep it positive and solution focussed. I will record the basics such as when I go to bed, rise, and whether I have achieved some of the basic daily/weekly goals. There are a whole load of things that I am not happy about in my current everyday life. The first aims I have for the next week or two are to be regular about my bedtime and rising, my exercise, and my core goals. I will go into more detail as I progress. Right now I am going to go to bed, much too late, and get too little sleep, and hope to make the most of tomorrow nonetheless.  The hope is that by 'going public' with my goals, I will leverage social pressure as well as my own self-regard/respect.

      Ok, this is my first ever blog entry, something of an experiment. My reason for starting this is to give me somewhere to tell the world what I am reading, thinking, wondering at and about. Perhaps I will make contact with occasional like-minded people.

      Long relaxed conversations with good friends are much to be savoured. A friend of mine was testing the coherence of my views on religion over a good meal. Basically I was proposing that a person would have a more meaningful life as a  urlLink humanist  than as a christian. Now this might sound rather bold. Mother Teresa? Your neighbour whose faith helped him not to crumble when his wife died? Surely I couldn't be suggesting that all those people would be better off without the beliefs that give their lives purpose? Well, I think that this question depends for its rhetorical force on the implicit comparison between the person with their faith, and that same person bereft of any guiding, inspiring source of passion for life. The implication is that particular individuals wouldn't find purpose without their religious beliefs. But this would be like defending the use of a clapped out old banger to get from A to B on the basis that it is better than walking, when perfectly good vehicular alternatives are on offer. Chesterton is often quoted as saying             "When a man stops believing in God he doesn't then believe in nothing, he believes in anything‚Äù            According to  urlLink Quotemeister , he never quite said this, but the quotation is popular with those who argue that religion is essential. Isn't society in such a mess precisely because it has abandoned the spiritual fundamentals of its culture? Doesn't the abandonment of religion leave a God-shaped gap in your life that nothing else can fill?              Sorry, but I don't think so.         For many, the beliefs they considered essential to their happiness can backfire like an old banger spluttering to a halt on the steep hills of life's road. Abandoning  urlLink Robin Reliant  Christianity does not mean purposeless pedestrianity. There is another way! I feel quite as passionate about my life and purpose now as I ever did, and that without the need for the authority of used-car-salesman assertions.

      It is one of the frustrations of being a humanist/ urlLink Bright , that we don't fit very well into the otherwise religious categories. Our presence is given a nod in the ugly phrase 'of all religions and none'. The 2001 urlLink  UK Census  says there are 14.6% who described themselves as 'of no religion', the second largest group after those who ticked 'christian'. So how are these people to be represented when goverment and others wish to consult? The philosopher  urlLink Daniel Dennett  amusingly  urlLink commented  that organising atheists is like trying to herd cats. In the public arena, I think we can work with the word 'belief' if not 'faith'.  Is it not true that humanists have beliefs? In fact I would go as far as to say that we therefore must be 'believers'. I must say that even in this cheeky mood I find it hard to say that I am part of a 'faith-community'. I will not for the moment push the idea that we have 'faith', as the word so often means believing in the face of contrary evidence. But we DO have beliefs. I wonder if a good approach to explaining humanism is that the difference in our beliefs is  where we get them from . Isn't this the crucial, central question, from which all others radiate? A public presentation might include asking those present how they 'know' things in general, and asking pertinent questions about whether, for example one 'knows' something because someone in authority says so, or because millions of people believe it, etc. I'm a believer!

      It is a great encouragement to meet people with a similar history. In the past few weeks I have had occasion to meet some lovely people and have had a rather similar conversation with them all. The person will have started adult life with very clear views about what the Truth is (as with me, it was  urlLink evangelical  christianity. Most were leaders and active proselytisers. In each case something happened in their life to provoke a reorganisation of their beliefs and they are now  a lot less certain and make far fewer claims on their own or other's behaviour. The annoying thing is that my Dad always said this would eventually happen to me - that I would mellow in my dotage. Well, he was right, but unfortunately he died before I could apologize to him for promoting beliefs that are without good foundation, and for looking down on his position as 'woolly liberal'. One of these people had simply got older and wiser, another had lost an adult child, another's marriage broke down. I wonder if it is generally the case that people mellow as they mature. Of course for some people (including me now), maturing  requires  mellowing by definition. Many of these people have moved from evangelical faith to a broader, more inclusive faith.  I went to a barbeque on Saturday. Never one to bother much with smalltalk, I spent most of the evening talking about religion and philosophy with a lovely couple who started off life in the Jehovah's Witnesses, shifted to evangelical christianity, and having studied philosophy are now much more liberal. It was particularly interesting  because the last time I met them, perhaps six years ago, I was a senior evangelical minister and they were solid members of an evangelical church. I was much relieved and encouraged to find that their pilgrim's progress had been at least in a similar direction to mine. This conversation raised the issue of the values shared by liberal christians and secular humanists. In both cases the agenda is 'this-worldly' and reason is highly prized. I must say I have found that some of the discourse in some secularist discussion lists is unnecessarily negative about liberal christians. It seems that believers of all types are easily lumped in together, as if there is anything much in common between a liberal and an evangelical christian. I am very much of the conviction that there is far more in common between the liberal wings of any religion than there is between the liberal and conservative wings of the same religion.

       urlLink 'Think'  by Simon Blackburn is part of my preparation for some teaching on philosophy of mind. Despite too little sleep last night, I understood some of it. It was mainly about Descartes and theories of knowledge. He summarises this section by identifying four main approaches in  urlLink epistemology . Descartes' Rational Foundationalism (you can trust your powers of reason and build your knowledge from there - Descartes); Hume's Natural Foundationalism (you can trust your sense-experience); Coherentism (main thing is it all fits together, never mind that it has nothing to do with 'reality'), and scepticism - the view that there really isn't any sound knowledge about anything. Now that last one would be a good one to keep in store for those exams children!  I have recently joined the  urlLink National Secular Society  and the  urlLink British Humanist Association . I will probably go into more detail about why I have on some more permanent web entry, but briefly, since changing from evangelical/charismatic to Agnostic/Atheist five years ago, I have felt the need for a more positive statement of my life-stance (eurrgh is there a better word?).  urlLink The Brights  is a less formal initiative along these lines. Am I a 'Bright'? I feel a little uncomfortable with the possible interpretation that people with a naturalistic world-view are obviously bright-er than those with a different position. Still I will probably go along with the term as I do think there is a need for one.  I was accosted on the tube today. Happily, it was a very good friend of mine. I broke my journey at his home and we (as always) had a wonderfully stimulating conversation about the above paragraph. He was of the opinion that the NSS in particular was rather unnecessarily anti-religious, and that humanists tend to be left wing (obviously bad according to his ... life-stance). Yet he and I were agreeing wholeheartedly that there is an instinct in humans towards some sort of ritual and ackowledgement of a sense of otherness etc. He was saying that his tenacious vestiges of spirituality are due to a feeling that some sort of Other (my terminology) is the best (of a bad bunch) of ways of explaining this instinct. I really am not so sure. I think that a basic understanding and appreciation of evolution is a cause of utter wonder (cf Dawkins'  urlLink 'Unweaving the Rainbow' . However the context of this discussion was the playing in the background of a Bach Cantata, and for me there is no denying a sense of *worship* that it stirs up in me. Should I have this desire to worship? If not, why do so many have it - pathology? If I should, what should a Bright/Humanist/Securlarist do with the desire? My best answer so far is to worship money sex and power. Only joking, although soooo many would love me to say this as they consider it the only alternative to worship of their concept of God. My proper best answer is simply to celebrate the wonder of being alive and ... listen to Bach Cantatas. But in German (if you don't know much) so that you don't have to feel awkward about the Pietistic personalism of the words.
