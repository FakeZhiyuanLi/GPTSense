      Venue: East Coast Park, toilet at Car Park B (the 1st car park when you enter from Fort Road, not counting the car park for heavy vehicles) Date: 23 May 04 (Sun) Time: 6.30 pm (about) Stats: 18 – 24 yo (est)/1.75m (at least)/65 kg (est) Chinese Bod: very tanned, well-built chest, lean thighs & legs, perfect V-shaped bod with absolutely no fats at all Looks: boyish, but aloof & expressionless Attire: topless with black Nike shorts  When I finished my run, he was already doing his warm-down. Sitting on the grass patch just beside the running track, he was spending an unusually long time doing his stretching. At times, his legs were wide open for all to see. But unfortunately nothing was revealed because of the inner lining. After a series of stretching, he went to his car to get his towel, change of clothes & toiletries. He then proceeded to the open shower point just outside the toilet. For those who are not familiar, this open shower point is covered on one side by a wall & the other side by a perforated sheet with holes of about 3 cm in diameter. Both the wall & the perforated sheet are about 1.6 m tall. There is an entry to the shower point that is not shielded. He was showering himself at the point that is furthest from the entry. I was sitting at the seat near the sink & looking through the perforated sheet, pretending to be looking only casually rather than ogling intensively. Being in a public place, he was wearing his black shorts throughout the shower. He took an inordinately long time to shower, unlike the normal person who would do it as quickly as possible when in a public place. He applied shower foam liberally & did a series of elaborate circular motions on his chest & abs & down to the sides of his waist. Then he dipped into his shorts to clean his crotch area. His shorts were pulled down slightly & I saw the tanline, which was pretty low. It was also at this juncture that it was obvious that he was not wearing brief under his shorts.  Then he did the same to clean his butt. After that, he went on to soap his thighs & legs. After an extraordinarily long time, he walked out of the shower area to dry himself with his towel in the open area beside the bench. He also took a very long time to do so. When he was happy with the drying, he went into a cubicle to change. Show over.    Have any of you seen this guy before? My assessment is that he is either a super straight guy who is unaware of the temperature that he was raising with his shower show or he is a narcissistic exhibitionist. Throughout the proceedings, he avoided eye contact with anyone. Let’s hope he does his run every Sunday & his shower show is a regular performance.  It certainly was a nice finish to the weekend & gave me inspiration for the new workweek. But it resulted in much unsatisfied craving as well!

         On recommedation by Sean, I recently purchased Renee Olstead's self titled debut album. Not a bad entry for this new comer. Interesting renditions of remade old favourties, with silky vocals which are versatile enough to handle the jazzy subgenres of swing, big band and ballads. This is a reasonably priced album which leaves one yearning for the next, which will hopefully feature more original compositions.  Check out  urlLink http://www.reneeolstead.com / for a listen.

      Decided to change my handphone on Saturday. The thought popped into my head whilst I was reading the morning papers and happened to chance upon all the handphone ads. Actually decided to get either the Sony Ericsson K700i or the Motorola E398 but when I got to the M1 shop was put off by their sizes. After comtemplating for (quite) a while at the shop, finally decided to buy the Nokia 6230.  Fell in love with it instantaneously. Especially the MMC card capability as well as the ability to use .mp3 files as ringtones and msg tones. Not to mention the camera which I am beginning to put to good (artistic) use. :) It also comes with a video recorder and screen savers. A huge step of Nokia. Although design wise it was nothing much to shout about.  Went to gym after that, and was glad I was able to get a locker despite the Mega-Combat event going on. Managed to finish my workout before the crowd returned and made my way to GWC. After not being able to get tickets for Spiderman2, Super Size Me and Mean Girls, decided to just have dinner @ Zion Rd with Jeff. Had yummy prawn noodles and curry chicken. Slurp. Went over to Balestier only to find the cinema only half full. Managed to get good seats for Spiderman2. Not to mention beside Leslie Kwok and his gf. :)  Went back, watched QAF, and headed out for supper @ Joo Seng. The old wet market had been renovated and the soy bean stall was no longer around. Had fishball noodles and packed you tiao, humcheepeng and a you-tiao-butter-fly-hybrid which Jeff termed C*eeB*e. Yummy!  Fell asleep watching QAF and woke up at 1030. Headed down to AMK for economical beehoon breakfast before heading back to more episodes. The sky was looming with malevolent grey clouds and the sounds of not-too-distant thunder was the perfect lullaby. Slept till 1630H, only to realize that the skies were crystal blue and the sun, brillantly strong. Dismal at having missed an entire afternoon of precious sun, we promptly headed to ECP for our run.  Covered 16km today, 2km up from last week. ITB started giving problems 500m into my run. Sigh. Hurts like hell now...  Had a sumptuous dinner @ Siglap Jap Restaurant before heading home.  Had a brief chat with Mel (he knows I run @ ECP - must be Jim's doings...) and we made an appointment this coming Saturday, after I return from Code Red.  Fatigue's setting in now. Going to bed. May there be sun tomorrow!

      Overslept this morning and decided not to go to work. Was woken up at 920 by a wokr-related phone call. The sky was cloudy and hence decided not to swim. Was reading the papers when I received another work-related phone call. Dr Loi called to ask if I could locum this evening and I reluctantly agreed. Realizing I would not be able to gym this evening, I decided to hit the gym before my 2 pm meeting at Sembawang.  Met Terry on his last day @ work. Finished my workout, unwound in the steam bath before making my way to the EVO KPI Workshop. Left early at the first oppurtunity and went for a swim @ SAFRA Yishun. Made my way home after the clouds hid the sun and started toying with additions to my blog.  Came back from locum and continued to fiddle with the alterations. Have been trying to find a free webhosting site which will allow public assess to php, ini, swf extentions (for my radio.blog). After a rather extensive search, I'm giving up hope. At least I managed to add the tagboard and links. Learnt a little about HTML code through trial and error.  There goes my Friday night I suppose. No borders or velvet I guess. Contemplating supper @ Serangoon. But company has not logged on yet. Busy perhaps...

      Managed to catch some sun on Wednesday afternoon before my duty. Had fish soup for tea to make up for my fishball noodle brunch. Ruined it all by making a huge detour to Fong Seng for 3 packets of banana-leaf nasi-lemak and 3 curry puffs. Dropped by West Coast Park on my way back to PLC. Nicely done up, with a huge white-sanded children's playground and a McCafe. Chatted with Mel abit over ICQ. Progress? Slow and steady.  Woken up this morning by a call from Ken Jin. Had asked me to pick him up from SAFTI since he didn't drive. Didn't have to do it in the end 'cause he'd asked Saiful instead. Decided to make my way to Sembawang - caught the last few minutes of capital budget allocation (more work) and resuscitator demo. Had a long breakfast on a rainy Thursday morning with the boys. Everyone seemed to be in a jolly good mood. Adjourned to Siglap for yong tau foo with Minghao and Jeremy, after which we idled the entire afternoon away at Jerm's place, reminising on the good 'o times, bitching on the current issues, and deliberating on our futures.  Got to the gym only around 6 but managed to finish by 730. Had fish soup dinner (I'm getting used to this) @ River Valley with Jeff before rushing home to 'The Apprentice'.  "Coffee gives him tremors... How cute I thought..."

      Was at the Fullerton yesterday evening for the wedding dinner of Cher Heng and Wenxuan. The lovebirds first met in Hwa Chong and started dating since Year Two. I suppose they'd reached a point in their relationship when marriage seemed to be the next natural and logical thing to do. It was a good oppurtunity to catch up with old classmates - probably the only reason making these dinners even marginally tolerable.   When I met the couple during the cocktail, Cher Heng reminded me of a question I posed him during MOCC.  "How do you know that she is the one?"  I cannot seem to recall his answers. Both then and yesterday.   Is there such an entity as "the one"?  As I struggle to remember his answer, as well as to find my own answers, one thing remains certain. The world was one bachelor less.

      Sunday Times Lifestyle 4th July 2004  Sumiko Tan   When an emergency like a huge blackout strikes, it's the small things that suddenly matter   The dogs started barking when the lights went out.  And when they came back on 1 hour and 45 minutes later, the neighbourhood dogs were at it again.  I don't know about you, but The Big Tuesday Blackout was the most exciting thing to have happened in my life for a long time.  Okay, perhaps that's not the politically correct thing to say (though it does say a lot about my life.)  There's no question that the blackout was a terrible thing and it shouldn't have happened.  Three hundred thousand households were affected. Thirty-seven people were trapped in lifts.  Thousands were on the road and a motorcylist and his pillion rider were hit by a car.  Imagine the terror of driving in pitch darkness flanked by the heavy shadows of silent buildings.  A colleague found his car suddenly swimming in a sea of ink on the PIE towards Bukit Batok.  It was surreal, he said, as though he had entered the apocalyptic movie Escape From New York.  Policemen worked frantically to direct traffic. Engineers raced to restore power supply. Businesses were hit.  Singapore's reputation was hurt as wire agencies rushed out sneering copy about how 'tiny Singapore', 'which prides itself on its first-class infrastructure', had suffered an extensive power failure causing 'some alarm and widespread irritation'.  But if you, like me, were safely ensconced at home, the blackout was - how shall I put it without getting flak? - an interesting experience.  The day after The Big Blackout, everyone in the office was comparing war stories.  Where were you when it happened? What time did it strike? What did you do? What time did the lights come back on?  Excited, almost exhilarated, by the experience, we were bonded by a sort of brotherhood of the blackout.  Pity those who lived through June 29 in total light yet oblivion.  IN MY part of the woods, the outage happened at 10.15pm.  I was at the computer when, without warning but with an almost audible sigh, the world went dead.  The lights died. The murmur of the TV and the drone of the air-con were no more.  Shoot, I thought, yet another power trip. I live in a 30-year-old house, so power outages are not unexpected.  Then it occurred to me that this was different.  For one thing, the purr of the generator in the nursing home behind my house was gone.  I looked out the window. The neighbourhood was cloaked in the blanket of night. Not a light twinkled.  Then the dogs started barking.  AS IN the other 299,999 households, the blackout resulted in a desperate search for light at my home.  Using my mobile phone as a mini beacon, I fumbled for torchlights and tealights.  The phone networks were down, but SMSes worked. Thousands of messages flew across the island as people checked if friends were hit too.  As the house got increasingly stuffy, we opened the windows and balcony doors.  Actually, it was a beautiful night. The moon was nearly full and a slight breeze blew.  I could see neighbours drifting out of their homes to share the experience and to find out more.  For half an hour, I had no clue. Then I remembered: We had a transistor radio somewhere.  I found it and learnt that the supply of gas from Indonesia had been disrupted, causing a blackout that stretched from Clementi to Sengkang.   If there are lessons to be learnt from The Big Tuesday Blackout, these are what I took with me:   Simple things still matter  Whoever deemed transistor radios irrelevant in this age of iPods and whatnot should think again. If not for the dusty contraption I found, I would have remained in the dark about what was happening until the power came back on.   Silence can be beautiful  How peaceful it was just looking out of the window on a quiet, dark night free of distractions like the TV. Perhaps I should do this more often.   The importance of neighbours  A colleague found himself without a torchlight, but a kind neighbour gave him a big, fat candle. Be nice to your neighbours. You never know when you need their help.   Family bonding  A friend of a friend said his father walked into his bedroom during the blackout and, for the first time in years, they actually had a chat.  At my place, my mother, a visiting aunt and I sat, Survivor tribal council-style, around a row of tea-lights.  I listened as they reminisced about the war and those faraway days when my aunt had to study under candlelight because the family could not afford electricity.   Vulnerability is not a bad thing  In those first few scary minutes of the blackout, did not the crazy thought occur to you that there had been a terrorist attack?  And when power was still not restored after half an hour, then an hour, then an hour and a half, did you not rue how easy it is to take things like electricity for granted?  The blackout was a reminder that Singapore is vulnerable and fallible, which is not a totally bad thing for the nation's soul.   Be Zen; have a sense of humour  Was there really a need to get upset and point fingers at the police, the power authorities or the telephone operator who did not pick up your call because hundreds of others were also calling him?  What good would that have done for your health, or the situation?  Sometimes, it makes better sense to be Zen about things, that is, be relaxed and detached, to ride out an inconvenience.  IN MY case, power was restored at the stroke of midnight.  I was dozing off already, radio by my side.  Just as suddenly as the lights went out, they snapped back on again, as did the air-con and other appliances.  The blackout was over. Life was back to normal.  Outside, under the full moon, no doubt spooked by the hum of power surging back through the cables, the dogs were barking again.

      Slept in for once on a Sunday morning since there was no locum. Woke up at 1030H, not being able to sleep anymore. Browsed through the Sunday Times and had pork porridge brunch. Sumiko Tan's article on how Tuesday's island wide blackout made her appreciate the simple, often overlooked things in life which we take for granted stuck a chord. Decided to head for the pool despite the clouds. Weather didn't hold. Started to drizzle rather heavily and took shelter and read 'The Light of Day'. Clouds cleared after a while, and there was even a little sun. Read a while more before heading to ECP for my run. The SAFRA couple were there and tried to make contact again. To no avail, of course. My pace slowed to a crawl again today, thanks to the excruciating bilateral ITB pain i was experiencing. Speaking of which, met Jason (the sports physician) whilst I was warming up. Tried not to acknowledge his presence but he came up and said hi. Hope he doesn't tick me off for not sticking to my abstience schedule. Met Jeff on my way back. Both of us were suffering from some form of knee pain or another, so we were both jogging at an embarassingly slow and disgraceful pace. Managed to finish my 14 km though. Washed up and changed up before heading to the Grand Copthrone for David Chew's wedding. Expected a platoon gathering of sorts but was disappointed to find only 3 other platoon mates. Was David that disliked? Sigh. Perhaps everyone else was at the Beaufort for Steven Teo's wedding, which I was (thankfully) not invited to. It was good catching up with Bang Teen, Andrew and Roland, who couldn't stop harping on the grading. Had to act blur and not reveal the fact that I knew my ranking. Dinner ended past 11, and I got home, limping up the stairs, checked mail and chatted with Mel. He asked for my name (I thought he knew), and suggested me met up soon. Perhaps sometime later. Need to work on the wretched Cochrane Protocol. Was sent a reminder letter yesterday. Contemplating passing it on the Dawn. Hmm. Let's see if she gives me the NDP tickets first? :)

         “Private Parts, with its remarkable performances and poignant message, is a special production that should not close until every person in this country has seen it.” The Straits Times, 1992  It took Singapore by storm when it premiered at the 1992 Singapore Arts Festival, generating a buzz that lasted well past its two sell-out seasons – both during the festival and its immediate rerun, when it played to an estimated audience of 20,000.  Many feel that Private Parts is popular playwright Michael Chiang’s best play to date; definitely, it is his most politicised! The man who defined Singapore comedy with runaway hits like Army Daze, Beauty World and Mixed Signals, surprised many with this pointed yet poignant piece of writing.  Pushing the envelope the way no other local production had ever done, Private Parts was a play many agree was ahead of its time. You get involved with a talk-show host who soon finds out the true meaning of reality TV. You get a glimpse of the brutality of media competition: how far would one go for higher ratings? Plus, for a nation of gawkers weaned on the night-time beauties of Bugis Street back in the 60s, here was an up-close peek into that mysterious world of drag queens. What more could you want from theatre in the rigid, pre-RA days of Singapore?   Hype aside, Private Parts made news because it was able to engross even the most conservative of audiences with its bittersweet (and unexpectedly moving) story about three transsexuals trying to find their place in life. Way before Hollywood was feted for daring to do the same by putting Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving in heels and makeup for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994). Not to mention Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguziamo donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything (1995)…   The story? Briefly, a Star Search winner fronts a current-affairs talk show to improve ratings. His life turns upside down when he ends up in a sex-change clinic with three transsexuals. After befriending them, he tries to get them on his show…   Private Parts proved to be such an audience favourite that it was revived in 1995 for another run, this time including a Mandarin version (which starred Edmund Chen and the late comedian Hua Liang) as well!   And now, 12 years on, Michael Chiang’s much acclaimed play returns to the Singapore stage for a limited season, to wow new audiences, and hopefully bring back some of its old supporters.   But alas, lack luster acting by both the lead male (Timothy Nga) and transsexuals (Christian Lee and Yeo Yann Yann) made it quite a chore to sit through this remake. Though hilarious at times (during the orgasm faking scene ?on national tv!!!) there were many times when the energy just wasn't there. Somehow the message that was supposed to be put across was done so a little too literally. Whatever happened to the art of delivering themes subtly through dialogue, actions and humour?  An overall disappointing theatrical experience.
