      I cried myself to sleep last night. I know, what a manly thing to do, right? ... Even though Chandra forgave me, I just can't forgive myself that easily. Something she said last night also kept popping up in my mind, aside from all the things she said to keep me from bashing myself as I deserve. When she came back, she said "I'm not that strong". That just made me think...that I'm making her weak. I know it's not what she meant, but that's how I felt. Anyway, yeah so last night was not a good night. I had a dream too.  It went all the way back to Florida, in January. This was during the time that I hadn't talked to Chandra at all for awhile. I had died, but everyone had thought I'd run away. So my spirit wandered around...and finally I found Chandra. But she couldn't see me. She heard that I'd "run away", and for awhile she cried, thinking I forgot about her completely. But she moved on eventually. Years passed, and she met someone. With this person, she was never sad, never hurt. She was blissfully happy...happier than I could ever make her. She had children, and she adored them and the man she was with. She was finally able to realise that she is a beautiful person...something I feel I have been unable to do despite my best efforts. The last thing I noticed...was that she completely forgot about ever knowing me. In Florida it was already discovered that I was dead. My family were the only ones who grieved for me. I was forgotten by everyone. And my soul, me...I lingered. Lingered in the presence of Chandra, who no longer remember even being with me...who had no reason to.  Of all dreams, this one had to be the most in depth one. Wonderful...

      I'm an asshole, as usual. Instead of spending the time with my girlfriend online as i should have, I was roleplaying, while she felt ignored. I think this is the lowest I've ever felt...maybe because she actually said it this time and didn't take it back that I did something wrong. I don't know. All I know is my eyes are watering up and my skin is getting hot, which I don't know if that's a part of it but it makes me feel worse physically. Nothing like saying if we were going to spend time together only to get back a 'I'd rather not since I've felt ignored this whole time'. ...Now I sound like I'm blaming her. Wonderful. Aren't I the greatest boyfriend ever... -_-

      I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 yesterday, and man was it great. Laughing one minute, appalled the next. Imagine, Bush being buddies with the people many thought were the enemy. Contradicting himself, and the stupidity. Oh it was crazy. I suggest everyone see this movie, especially Bush supporters, though I know they won't because they wouldn't want to see anything antiBush, even if it is all true. I'm speaking from experience, and I know not all Bush supporters would be like that, but the ones I know are. I found out there's another documentary on 9/11 and after. It's called  urlLink 911: The Road to Tyranny , by Alex Jones, and it actually came out two years ago. It says a lot more than Moore did, and doesn't just point to Bush, but to the government as a whole, including the CIA and the Pentagon. This one has to be my favorite thought:  FBI TRAINING MANUALS THAT ARE BEING GIVEN TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT STATE THAT CHRISTIANS, GUN OWNERS, AND "THOSE WHO MAKE FREQUENT REFERENCES TO THE US CONSTITUTION" ARE TERRORISTS  Gotta love that, right. I like  urlLink this flyer  not because of its protest to Moore's film getting praise when Jones did it first, but because of what's below the bold, black line, which gives more info on what happened during 9/11. I also found on a  urlLink British online news site  an article, which had one sentence that really caught my attention:  "Throw Bush out, throw Bush out," an audience in California's Orange County, a conservative stronghold, chanted as the lights went up after one showing.  One thing I don't like is the now supposed link between Moore and The Carlyle Group, who he bashes in the film as an organization profiting from the war and such, that they are now part owners of Loews Cinemas which is showing his film. What the hell does that mean? Doesn't mean he's directly linked with them or anything. It could be a ploy to stop his movie after all. Oh well, that's the New World Order for you.  Here are some sites worth looking at:   urlLink infowars.com   urlLink underreported.com   urlLink americanfreepress.net   urlLink prisonplanet.com   Stay informed people. Knowledge is power, and it is the only power we have against a corruption to the highest degree.

      I am so seeing this movie when it comes out Friday.  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  was written by Michael Moore, and basically documents what happened in the Bush Administration and in the country after September 11th. I'm seeing it, whose with me?

      I feel dead inside. Is there an official term for that? Like my eyes are half closed all the time, and I just feel like I don't care about anything. It's the feeling that "bla" describes perfectly. And like I'll feel tired, sleepy at night, but not want to go to sleep. I start getting frustrated about stupid things, and that frustration just adds to the feeling. I don't know what else to say, other than bla.... They need to make that an official word or something.

      Well I'm feeling really crappy right now, like I want to throw up. Sometimes I wish I had no emotion at times like this, at least then I wouldn't feel like garbage one moment, a complete asshole the next, and like shit almost all the time. I think I'll shut the blinds and sit here staring into space for awhile as I contemplate why I'm such a dumbass.

      Now Chandra thinks I'm pissed at her. I hate when one side of my life screws around with the other, i.e. Parents and love life. Darn parents, always screwing with everything
