      I watched this movie last week.  I wasn't harbouring high hopes when i decided to watch the movie, it was a treat from a friend, so i went with it; just hoping to get a good laugh out of it.  Indeed, laughing was all i did throughout the whole movie.  It was so funny seeing Jack Black so obsessed with rock music & his electric guitar.  The kids made the show even better.  However, i'm not sure if it's just me or someone else might be thinking about the same thing; some feelings i had after watching the show.  Isn't Dewy (Jack Black) very much like what we are in our teens?  The aspirations to be like our idols, whether rock or pop.  We all wanted to be able to break free from the conventional way of studying & desired more freedom to do the things we LOVE.  We listened to our kinda music where our parents want us to be the best in school, if possible, the best in the neighbourhood; so they could show us off like a commodity.  We were forced to learn the things we HATE, ballet/piano/computer; almost everything that ain't enjoyable.  Being interested in the alternative were always deemed undesirable and 'good-for-nothing'.  You name it, there's always the proper way of doing things; in the eyes of parents.  (1) Classical music vs Rock  (2) Mini skirts vs Knee-length skirts  (3) Academic study vs Art/Design; the list goes on.  Our childhood is dictated by our parents, how can we enjoy it at all?  I wish i had the chance to live in a kampung where  all you do after school is playing five stones, catching or catching tadpoles in the river, compared to homework, tuition &  more HOMEWORK!  So much of being a child....we thought they were carefree....

      It's the beginning of another boring week again.  Yesterday has got to be one of my lowest point in life.  I was feeling so lousy at work and worthless.  I wanted to leave the job so so much, you can't imagine.  I felt like i was strangled by the politics in office & the hatred of my lady boss towards me.  She was just god-damned biased towards those she favoured (whom don't deserve) and deprived me of the impartiality she should be showcasing.  I had wanted so badly to tender my resignation yesterday.  I had the letter all typed out & kept it in my bag.  I was hesitant to hand it out as I have alot to think about before i really really decide to quit my job.  The financial strain would be drastic, i have my installment loans, insurance, bills to worry about.  I'm not without a care in the world that i can just quit & be free from the clutches of that bitchy boss.  Anyway, alot of times; we are often cornered by the facets of reality.    Ideally  , we should be pursuing a career aligned with our interest.    Realistically  , it's often not the case; many of us are stuck in jobs we hate and can't wait to escape from.  There aren't many people i know whom are able to invest all their time and life in their area of interest & still able to make it their job.  More often than not, they usually have to forgo/sacrifice their material comforts and risk social acceptance.  That's reality for you, both you and I go through it & ended up as victims of reality vs idealogy.

      I'm now sitting in the classroom of my Macromedia Dreamweaver (MMDW) lesson.  Today's the last lesson of this level, i'm so happy & relieved to have reached where i am now.  I have learnt alot from this class & have definitely reaped rewards from it.  Hopefully, the newly acquired skill would help me in getting a cushy job & enhancing the chances of me snagging a job in the media industry...haha! (can't wait for that to happen, man!)  I also have to say thanks to my friend, Lian.  She was the one whom encouraged me to take up this course with her.  We have been close since we finished our Adv Dip classes with MDIS last year.  I'm both grateful & thankful to have a friend like her for motivation & guidance.  I guess all of us pick up new skills & techniques everyday, the world's revolving everyday; it doesn't stop & waits for you to catch up.  Life is indeed short, make use of what you have & do what you want.  Legally, of course.  Don't let yourself down, be true & not deprive yourself of what you wanna achieve in life; regrets are wasteful.

      Times passes by so quickly, do you ever wonder what will happen tomorrow?  Life's so unpredictable, everything gets thrown at you for no rhyme or reason.  Sometimes, i do wonder about the happenings in the world & how it would affect me or the community.  Yet, life can be so simple and we can make it through without much effort.  However, not that many of us are that fortunate.  We go to school in the rigid study environment, autocratic parents, pressure to excel & sometimes; inferiority sets in.  I remembered my ambitions when i was young, i aspired to be a doctor when i was in primary school.  The thought of wearing a crisp white robe & being able to save lifes all felt so great at that time.  Then came secondary school, the aspiration changed directions.  I wanted to be a journalist/reporter, though i was rather strong in my languages, the education system then didn't allow you to enrol into an educational institute based on your language merits alone; you needed Maths/Science & Humanities.  I'm hopeless in those subjects, barely passed during the Biggie Os!  There's goes the aspiration again...  In the end, i settled for an engineering course; which i still find unbelievable when i think about it now.  Which idiot would opt to study to be an engineer when they are hopelessly aimless with Maths & Science?  I'm that IDIOT!  As expected, my grades weren't that great; i gave it all up with a year left; another moronic move!    Then came worklife at the Social University, with only an 'O' level education to boast about at that time; i settled for a retail job.  The hours were long & the pay was pathetic.  But i was happy, with my other colleagues, we would sometimes get together for supper after we closed the shop at night.  Those were the carefree days, no exams or tests to cram for & no pressure to excel, just make sure & pray hard that I do not offend a customer.  A year or so went by, I started feeling inadequate.  I saw an ex-classmate of mine from the polytechnic while i was working.  I suddenly felt so ashamed of myself, i wanted to hide & wished i was invisible.  But alas, she saw me & i avoided eye contact with her.  She didn't say a word when she saw me, but i knew that she definitely recognised me.  Was she too ashamed to be associated with me?  I wonder...  Now, with a quarter of the century gone; I'm proud to say that i have been able to fulfill some of the aspirations i harboured during my younger days.  I have managed to attain higher education on the area of my interest, Mass Communications.  Armed with the higher qualifications, i've begun looking for a job that will consume & exploit my interest in the industry.  But, the big break hasn't arrive yet; at least for me.  Who says life is so predictable & all planned out for you by the Man up there?  It is what you make out of life that matters the most.  I forgot where/whom i heard the below phrase from, but i find it real meaningful & tries to live by it.    "You Only Live Once, Make it Worthwhile"

       urlLink       4th Team to go...&nbsp;    urlLink      Phew, unknowingly; we have come to the 4th week of The Amazing Race.    &nbsp;  You can't help but notice that the teams are more scheming & definitely more competitive.&nbsp; They are strategizing more than the teams in previous series.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Brandon & Nicky just showed how true that was on this week's race.&nbsp; They were originally in a pact with 3 other teams (Colin/Christie, Chip/Kim & Marshall/Lance).&nbsp; Colin/Christie managed to get the 3 teams&nbsp;bus tickets which departed later but arrived&nbsp;at&nbsp;the destination at the same time.&nbsp; The time gained gave them time to hop to the travel agent to discuss &&nbsp;get&nbsp;their flight bookings to St. Petersburg, Russia.    &nbsp;  In the end, Colin & Christie were given the gracious go-ahead from the 3 teams on the earliest flight.&nbsp; Brandon & Nicky were the smarter team out of the remaining 3 teams &amp;&nbsp;scooted off to the airport earlier to secure them the&nbsp;second earliest flight out to St. Petersburg.    &nbsp;  However, the 2-pound of cavier at the Roadblock was the bomb.&nbsp; Colin/Christie & Brandon/Nicole lost their lead at the cavier.&nbsp; They would never advance if this was Fear Factor, hah!    &nbsp;  Anyway, was kinda sad to see Bob & Joyce getting eliminated.&nbsp; They were the slow & steady type whom everyone likes.&nbsp; Nonethless, they have at least got each other for the rest of their life now.&nbsp; Sure everyone is glad for them.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink   &nbsp;    Ouch   &nbsp; urlLink      Today has got to be one of those painful days.&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed my aerobics class due to the usual lousy work commitments, was feeling moody the whole day & finally had to suffer the pain of my&nbsp;recent&nbsp;ear piercing.  My left ear lobe was swollen so badly that&nbsp;i had no choice but to remove the earring from the 2-week old pierced hole.&nbsp; True enough, it had began to swell badly & had pus oozing out from the hole.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was horrific & painful to watch, according to my younger sister (who happened to have 10&nbsp;ear piercings; both ears combined) whom helped me to remove the stud; at least i was spared from watching the mildly gruesome scene,&nbsp;phew!  Now, I have another&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;earrings on.&nbsp; Hopefully, they hold up & i'm able to keep the piercing.&nbsp; I certainly do not hope to go through the suffering again, it sucked pretty bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink        Eliminated -- I Love Them !!   &nbsp; urlLink      What a shame!&nbsp; The father & daughter tag team of Jim &amp; Marsha were eliminated this week on Amazing Race.   Marsha was confused at the ticket counter at the airport & got Brandon/Nicole confirmed places on the flight; but missed out hers.&nbsp; What a pity!!&nbsp; So much for being nice.   Both Jim & Marsha were great during the&nbsp;3 weeks&nbsp;they managed to&nbsp;stay in the Race.&nbsp; Jim survived a terrible gash&nbsp;on his knee in the 1st week & managed to climb up to the 3rd place&nbsp;in the 2nd week, before getting eliminated in this week.   Well, i guess the race goes on for them after the elimination; at least they seem to have known each other better&nbsp;during the race; judging from their parting comments.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp;

       urlLink    Jazzy Jamie &nbsp; urlLink    &nbsp;  I was at Aquadisiac at Wisma&nbsp;last Fri for Jamie Cullum's exclusive showcase&nbsp;in Asia.&nbsp; It was simply awesome, i never knew jazz could be so appealing &amp; welcomed by the young.    &nbsp;  The crowd were mostly youngsters in their&nbsp;mid-20s, though there were groups&nbsp;of older crowd; but i dare say that the younger crowd definitely outnumbered them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Jamie Cullum was so full of energy &amp; friendly, he played the piano with soul &amp; spiced it up with jazz &amp; pop sound; simply irresistable.&nbsp; It sounded so good that you could almost hear his songs over &amp; over again.    &nbsp;  The&nbsp;recent success of young jazz artistes like Michael Buble &amp; Diana Krall may have paved the path for Jamie.&nbsp; However, Jamie made his songs more interesting with an element of pop; probably that's why he's so well-received by both the young &amp; old.    &nbsp;  Anyway,&nbsp;Jamie's CD is&nbsp;what i have in my discman now ..."I'm singing in the rain, just singing in&nbsp;the rain, what a glorious feeling; i'm happy again" ....(JC -- Singin' in the Rain) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink         The "Lion"      &nbsp;  Recently, I was caught up with watching the World Pool Championship on cable.&nbsp; I never knew i had an interest&nbsp;in 9-ball pool.&nbsp; It was certainly interesting.  &nbsp;  In fact, I had just finished watching the&nbsp;extremely exciting quarter-final between Alex Pagulayan (CAN) &amp; Chao (TPE).&nbsp; It was certainly nail-biting,&nbsp;I was rooting for Alex.&nbsp; The young Canadian didn't disappoint, he won the game in the end; just edging the no. 1 seed, Chao by 1 rack.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow, the 4 semi-finalists would play the the semi &amp; final, almost back-to-back.&nbsp; Hopefully, the Lion keeps up to his amazing performance &amp; win the title.  &nbsp;  I'll&nbsp;definitely be watching.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       urlLink      another young team ELIMINATED    It's the 2nd week of The Amazing Race.  As usual, some teams hurry off to a great start & catching up; while some fall behind & never made up for the lost time.  It's a pity to see another young team getting eliminated again.  Donny & Alison were first at pit-stop last week.  What a change of events & turn-around!!  They made several time-wasting mistakes & weren't able to get back to where they started from.  Also, the cousins & the twin sisters are getting on my nerves now...hope they go soon.  Ok, another week of anticipation, till next Wednesday.

       urlLink    Dennis & Erika : Eliminated First&nbsp; urlLink     The season premiere of The Amazing Race 5 was simply awesome!  I watched the whole 90mins of it twice!  Once on AXN on cable & another time on Mediacorp Channel 5, it was simply too good to be missed & extremely pulsating to watch it twice.  For this time, there were only 11 teams of 2, instead of the usual 12 teams of 2.  Wonder if 1 team backed out or they couldn't get enough applicants (not likely). Anyway, if I ever get the chance to go to the States, I would do anything to get myself in TAR.  It must be th best thing it would have happened to me IF I'm successful during the selection process.  I'm so excited that I don't even know what I'm talking about, hahaha!!  Unfortunately, it has to be one of the younger teams whom was eliminated first.  Dennis & Erika are such eye candy to start with & they lost because they were too nice to let every other team get their taxi first; you can't be nice on TAR, it would cause your demise.  Nonetheless, I'm so looking forward to next week's show....can't wait.

      I'm not sure if you realised, our habitat is getting worse.  The environmental damage & abuse of our already limited natural sources of engery is ongoing everyday, God knows how long we can keep it going.  With global warming & the waning of our energy sources, experts & scientists have predicted that the end is nearing and could happen within this century or the next.  Indeed, we are are still taking things easy.  No sign of worrying or scrabbling among us as yet.  Of course, that's understandable.  The population of Singapore is so sheltered under the "great wing" of protection under the ruling party, PAP.  It's no wonder, they are not at all worried or having the jitters yet, until PAP says so.  If we look at how the major blackout last week left almost 3/4 of Singapore in complete darkness, it just shows how vulnerable our small island is.  Anyone harbouring the thought of dealing Singapore with a blow to the economy & internationally can just strategise to bring the natural gas supply from Indonesia to a halt & disrupt the water supply from Malaysia.  There, we would be without electricity & water.  The 2 most fundamentals of our daily essentials.  To think that we have always professed ourselves to be the business/economy hub of South East Asia & a cosmopolitian country.  What would we be if we are without the sources of energy & water from neighbouring countries.  Probably it's time for us to ponder upon instead of being just being contented with being the "best" in the region.

       urlLink      Merciless time wait for no man, how true & realistic can this statment be.  Try as i might, I can no longer pretend to be young.  I'm already in my mid-20s, soon the dreaded "30" wil come and go; without me even noticing it.  However, there would always be a little part of me that refuses to grow up.  I would always wished that I'm still a child and be freed from the annoying and vexing problems of adulthood, don't you too?  I have just finished reading "Harry Potter : The Prisoner of Azkaban" yesterday.  I've never expected to be so absorbed in the story like a little kid.  I started on it & I simply can't wait to finish the book.  I thought this kinda excitement was only reserved for kids 1/2 my age.  However, I have to admit that J.K. Rowling is a damn good author.  Well, it's grow-up time.  I gotta go & scan through the classifieds, hopefully there would be a few suitable job openings I can try applying for.  Ciao for now!

       urlLink    National Day - 09th August 04  urlLink     It's the nation's birthday in another 9 hours.  What amazing progress we have made as a nation for the past year.  We got through the frightening SARS & fought it; standing unified as a nation.  There are definitely images that belonged exclusively to Singapore.  I was at Bedok interchange's food centre this morning.  An elderly & feeble man came up to my table and shoved me 4 packets of tissue, 4 for a dollar.  I gave him $1 and took the tissue packs.  Also, I saw another elderly man going around the tables to pick up the aluminium drink cans that the diners had finished.  I reckon he's collcting them for the meagre cash he's able to get by selling them to recycling companies.  I'm sure these aren't unfamiliar scenes to most Singaporeans; cos i'm sure all of us had the chance to dine at a food centre at one time or another.  Sometimes, i wonder if these elderly folk have a place to stay or the food centres are their place of rest every night.  Don't they have children whom can feed & clothe them sufficiently, so that they wouldn't have to peddle tissue packs at food centres at the risk of falling &amp; shoving around by inconsiderate crowd.  Have we done enough for these old folks?  Have we imparted the correct morals to our future generations on how to treat the old folks?  We are fast becoming a nation with ageing population, are we ready for the challenges; as we celebrate the nation's 39th birthday?     HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SINGAPORE !!

       urlLink       No Elimination this week     urlLink     This week's race was nail-biting. so many events making it one of the most exciting, among the others.  Bowling moms, Linda & Karen survived a scare &amp;amp; avoided elimination; with a bad twist though. Other than the ankle twist they suffered, they had to surrender all their accumulated cash throughout the past weeks & wouldn't be given any for the start of next week's race. How frightening is that!  This week, we also saw a  very very different  side of Chip. He became "Mr Nice Guy" instantly by helping Brandon pull his stone boulders &amp; even helped his "arch rival", Kami & Karli when they couldn't find the Roadblock. How amazing!  Nonetheless, i was truly impressed with Colin &amp; Christie this week. Not only did they managed to get an earlier flight, they got a flight that reached Cairo easily 12 hours before the others could have arrived in Cairo. IMPRESSIVE !  Can't wait for next week's race, to see how Linda & Karen survive the race without cash; and how Colin &amp; Christie manage their massive lead over the others.
