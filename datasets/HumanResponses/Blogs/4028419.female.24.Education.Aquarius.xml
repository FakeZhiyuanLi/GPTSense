       Wanna know something funny? Whenever I'm in my "feeling lonely" mood and driving in my car, I can't stand to wasn't bad at all! I don't know what things may be looking like for me in the future, but I alisten to anything but the dumb songs that make no sense like "White-Tee" and "Get Low" and the other crazy, but popular songs. I don't know, I guess I just feel like the DUMBNESS of these songs has GOT to lift my mood;) At least I don't focus on what was bothering me in the first place-something about hearing "till the sweat drops down...etc." that makes me forget my troubles at least momentarily-lol.  Yesterday wasn't bad...m blessed with the ability to grab onto those days where the sun seems to be shining just a bit brighter for me and hold those days closer to me than the rest. Some people in my depressive state only harp on the bad days and that's what draws them into their depression even more. But that's why I think I'll eventually win out: I can recognize the blessing of a beautiful day and it, at least for the time being, eclipses all of the bad ones that seemed to haunt me previously.  All I have is this life. That's all any of us have--at least that we know of. So I am trying my best to spend it loving and/or being loved. So even though I may feel the absence of the romantic love that I know I deserve right now, I feel like I can at least make someone ELSE'S day good by letting them know how much I love them.     It's funny because I can always see everyone else's life SOOOOOO clearly.  I mean I can straight "Dr. Phil" them to death! But when it come s to me, I'm just freakin' "Jerry Springer"--LOL:)  That's why I need to hurry up and publish one of my books--so I can read my own advice through my characters.  Well, like I said, yesterday-last night- was a  good  one. I hope there are many more to come. If there aren't, I guess I can brace myself for that. If there are, I'll be ready.

       Sometimes I felt like I was just going through the motions to keep myself afloat. I couldn't have love at the time, so I closed my eyes and pretended the one I was with was loving me--ME, not just "that part" of me. I guess it works for the 15 minutes. But after that is done, I want to feel more. I want to be ABLE to feel more. I DESERVE to feel more. But I smile and pretend that it's enough when I know that it's not. I just make it enough. But I feel so empty.  So, I called H and told him that I didn't like the way he kinda hung up on me when he found out that I wasn't coming to see him. He told me he was sorry that he made me feel bad, but that I had gotten his hopes up and he had really wanted to see me. I told him I thought it was about sex but he said it was emotional for him. That he wanted to really see me, just hang out with me-be with me. I wish I could believe him. I need to believe him. If it's true, then I will feel really good. But who knows with him. I think the thing with H is that I am too aware of his ability to play games so I want to try to peep the game before I let him play it--he could very well be sincere, but time will reveal that-as it does everything.  When I love me. When I SEE me. When I NEED me. Then, and only then, will I  truly  BE. Easier for me to say it though...

        So after it's all over, will people remember me?  Will I be remembered for something other than being someone's daughter, cousin, teacher, neice?  One of the things that really sunk in when my uncle passed was how, despite everything, he was luckier than many other people because he had experienced true, undying love.  A lot of people have love in their lifetimes, but not everyone gets that "union-of-two-souls" kind of love.  And I know that sounds existential but that's how I see it.  Now I'm cooking some chicken alfredo...I hope.  It depends on what it comes out as--LOL---Okay, so the alfredo was great.  Now I'm starting to get sleepy.  One thing I have yet to figure out is why people say they're gonna call and don't?  I mean, if you think you might or might not call, then just don't say anything at all.  I think maybe I put too much faith in people. Then again, maybe I need to calm the heck down and stop assuming so doggone much:)   Well, gonna turn in now.

       I'm sitting here because I can't sleep.  I'm trying to find some kind of fancy words to say to start this, but I'm at a loss...that's funny, ME at a loss for words.  I guess I'm just thinking about the way I can get myself so excited about life one minute, but the next minute I'm worrying about what's the point of it all.  Will I ever be happy???  I know that the happiness is only going to start with me, but how am I supposed to be happy when it seems like the world is crumbling around me one day, but then I'm sitting on top of it the next.       Rambling, I know.  Let's see if I can head in some direction.  I've been dealing with someone I shouldn't be.  All things tell me that much; yet I can't let it go.  Did my self-esteem reach an all time low?!(didn't mean to rhyme) I'm not this person I'm allowing myself to be with him.  You know, part of me is scared to let go because I don't want HIM to be hurt...funny isn't it?  I do think I loved him, but I honestly don't see how it's going to work...yet I don't see how to let it go.  And if it's timing that's wrong, why can't I let it go and let the plan unfold if it's meant to be?  I really need to get it together.         My ex, J, has ticked me off again.  I just wonder if he gets off on saying things to hurt me.  It's funny how he acts as if I was more deeply involved in the relationship than he was--when his best friend told me that he was planning on proposing to me sixth months later (told her this a week before he broke it off).  Every time I express my feelings about something, being hurt or possibly uncomfortable going to his going away party because his new girlfriend might be there...he tells me "oh get over it!"  (she's not gonna be there, by the way, but still).  And I keep TELLING myself: you don't want to be with a guy like that ANYWAY!!! But it just seems like he was the one...but he couldn't be.  Reason tells me he couldn't be because "the one" would never, I mean NEVER, cut me in the places where he knows I'll bleed the most (figuratively speaking, of course).  J was good for my life because he showed me many things I never even knew I wanted in a man--but I think the biggest requirement I have to remember is to find a guy that takes care of my heart.  Love is all we have left at the end--and I don't want to be left empty handed.       I met a new friend tonight and enjoyed talking to him.  It was really easy.  I can tell within two minutes whether I'll feel like talking to someone more than once...we talked for about 2 hours.       I worry about myself sometimes.  Sometimes I feel like there's so much to look forward to; other times, I couldn't care less if my world ended right now.  Scary thing to live with, isn't it?

        *this post is dedicated to K--the rainbow of  my latest storm...*          Well, after the rain, there's always a small measure of calm that's still blanketed by the dampness of everything, but it's calm nonetheless.  That's how I feel now--like the "after-storm".  After yesterday's post, I felt kind of drained, but I think that's a good thing.  I think feeling drained like that must mean that I'm being purged of those bad feelings--otherwise, why would i feel "drained"? (didn't think about it like that, did ya?-lol)       Well, I think one thing that helps is validating the idea that the people in your life really should be there--although you  may never know in what capacity.  I can just say I really have to thank K for being the person that he is.  He came by today to hang out and I made dinner (which he SAYS was good, but he's nice like that...)  Well, not that I expected anything less, but we had a really good time.  We bounced back between playing playstation (he sucks at tennis-lol-j/k) to seriously discussing how we felt about life/love/etc. in general to being REALLY silly at Connect Four.  I don't know 'bout K, but that was one of the FUNNIEST things I've done in a long time--I had a good time.  I am very glad to know him--we ALL need a person like him in our lives, trust me.  So anyway, that totally lifted my spirits.  Also learned a lil more about him and how he sees things; explains a LOT for me(not in a bad way)--I like the way he thinks.          I am so sleepy I could just....uh...well...sleep!-lol.  Sorry, nothing profound to say there!:)            I know there's always gonna be a storm--ALWAYS.   The thing to remember is that wherever there's a storm, a rainbow lies somewhere--maybe not in your direction every time--but eventually, you'll see your rainbow.  K is a person I am so very happy to know and he, unknowingly, helped me remember that the rainbow does exist, even if I can't always remember to look for it.  (hey, K, did I blow your head up enough?!:))

        3-2-1, 1-2-3 what the HECK is bothering me?!!  Whew! had to get that outta my system.  I am just frustrated with my life and most of the people in it.  I do not understand why people just use their word so loosely-knowing they have no intentions of keeping it.  And what's with these people that ONLY decide you're worth something once you stop giving them the time of day.           *KB is starting to call me and saying how he wants things to be the way they  were....UUUGGHH! I had TOLD him a long time ago, when he first started actin' up, that once a person takes me for granted and keeps letting me down and never making me feel like I have at least SOME importance in his life, then my heart slowly, but SURELY moves away from him.  It's like getting cut too many times in the same place; you start to get used to the pain and therefore your feelings become numb.  And the only reason he's started to try to come around and do right is because he senses that I had pulled away from him.  That's BEEN over! The thing about me, I'll love someone completely, but if he abuses that, doesn't return it, or whatEVER, then I close that door!          Then it seems like the guys who ACT like they're SOOOO interested are so darn caught up in trying to be a player that they neglect the fact that I'm a good person...until I've LOST interest!          Oh, and let's not forget the married ones!  What the heck is wrong with you?  If I'm supposed to be the one you think you would just loooooove to be with, u shoulda took a bit more time BEFORE getting married to think about that possibility--heck, don't  I  deserve someone of my own?!  Maybe I don't...          My GOD! I deserve so much more in my life and I know it.  I know I'm not perfect, but I have so much in me that I know is good and I deserve a good person that WANTS to be in my life....not one who feels OBLIGATED to be or feels THREATENED that I might not be "pining away" for him anymore.  It has me so sad because I feel VERY alone right now.  Even the few friends I do have are ignoring me...okay, I might just be making that up; U know I can make a mountain out of a mole hill--but it FEELS that way!!!          I just feel so sad right now; very let-down at every, and I mean EVERY turn.  I think the problem is that I put my trust in Man(not as a substitute for God)...and we know, Man will disappoint you every time.  Knowing this...how do you stop hurting?  Sometimes the pain is unbearable and everyone around me thinks I'm okay 'cause I manage to keep a smile on my face--If they only knew...          I seriously feel like giving up--not on LIFE! (lol)--but on being happy, at least not in the "true love" way.  I just don't think it's in the cards for me.  It seems like I get my hopes up for no reason bc the person only wants "something else".   I guess there are people in this life who are meant to just be used for sex, leaned upon for emotions, and disregarded for everything else...am I one of 'em?          *Disclaimer:  This sounds really depressing, but it's how I feel at the moment!  Don't worry, I'm not about to jump off a cliff!--lol

      Well, it's been a few days....A lot has gone down..kinda.  Not really, nevermind-lol.  So, I just had the WORST day emotionally.  I don't know WHAT is going on.  I talked to K and he is one of the brightest spots that I can think of.  He's really a dear because he actually bothered to listen to me.  Quite special, I would say.  So anyway, I am trying not to concentrate on feeling so sad and confused--but I guess because I can see so clearly the way my life COULD be, it is SO hard to be patient.  I don't know; why do I feel as if being patient is not the thing.  I feel like "why wait?"--although these things are rarely left up to us.   I really miss Aaliyah (lol, like I knew her).  But I was just reading through some old articles I have of her and she was just such a beautiful person with a beautiful soul.  You could see it in her face, in her eyes, in her life, in the people she left behind.  I think the most tragic of all is that she was so YOUNG.  But from the sound of it, she experienced a lot of things before she died--love, success, etc.--so she was still quite lucky.  I think, no, I KNOW that when she died, I had told myself that I was never going to waste a minute if I could help it.  Her being so young (about my age) and my "growing up with her" made me see my own mortality in an alarming way.  I just don't know how much time I have here and, as morbid as it may sound, I'm trying to capture EVERYTHING I can as soon as He sees fit, before I die.  I just wish everyone else would jump on the darned bandwagon...

      Okay, one thing that has been bothering me has been the fact that in like every movie and book I've been reading lately, there's a man that is having an affair.  It is driving me crazy because, although it is fictional, it is making me believe that NO man is capable of being faithful.  I think that's the one thing that worries me about whenever I get married and stuff--having to deal with a husband who cheats.  I think that would totally demolish the very core of my heart! (powerful, huh?!)  ... I know, I know, sounds wild for a person without even a HINT of a marriage proposal, but I'm an Aquarian--we think far ahead more than we do in the present.  But seriously, I just had a talk about this with one of the "bruhs" and he was saying how he KNOWS he won't cheat on his wife--whenever he finds one.  But, it's not that I don't believe in a man's capability to be faithful, it's just that we, as young ladies, were conditioned by society to think that a man can't control his carnal desires...often times that is not the case, often times it is.   Either way, it still bugs me--then again, I'm just that type of person who FINDS something to worry about--lol.  I pray, I PRAY, that I can just be blessed with a person who is honest with himself and KNOWS himself very well.  I think that is the essential ingredient of all lasting relationships: each person is fully aware of him/herself so that he/she can be fully aware of what it will take to REALLY satisfy him/her.  Well, the thing about me is, I KNOW I have this thing on lock; the man that ends up with me will be the HAPPIEST, most FULFILLED man on earth!!!  So, if he cheats, that would be HIS dumb butt!--lol;  I mean, I know that in order to have this grand thing called love truly exist in your life, you have to be willing to let go and take that risk;  I told a friend, just like if you play the nickle slots at the casino, yeah, your chance of loss isn't that great, but neither is the size of the reward if you win.  Conversely, if you play the dollar machine, yeah,  you put up more money and stand to lose a bit more, but the if you hit the jackpot...

       How often do we tell ourselves "I love you"?  I mean, we're quick to tell a girl/guy that we love them, yet it feels awkward for us to tell ourselves the same.  Don't believe me?  Well, get out a mirror RIGHT NOW and say to the person in it, "I love you."....do it for real! --well, if you did it (and especially if you didn't), then you see my point.  But the thing is, why have we conditioned ourselves to give "love" so freely to everyone else but ourselves!? Isn't that the FIRST person (note: person, not being like God) to whom we should say "I love you"?  I know a lot of people, me included, who wonder why they don't have love in their lives; but the thing is, how will I ever know if someone is loving me right when I don't love me?  And this kind of thing shows.  People can tell when you don't love yourself.  Well, before you can really seek this "everlasting love," you must give that same love to yourself.      My approach is to love me COMPLETELY; this way, I will know what good, true love is supposed to feel like...also, when "he" comes along, I will love  him  the way that he deserves, also!  I'm not about that empty "I love you" phrase, and this life is too short to fill it with a bunch of nothingness!

      Today is just one of those "blah" days.  A day that is masked more in gray than in color or black-and-white.  Well, I went with a friend to see Jamie Foxx's new movie "Collateral".  I think Tom Cruise was supposed to be the star (and he was good), but Jamie did his thing.   Everyone should see it and support the black man:)  Well, I had to wake up at the butt-crack of dawn...well, okay 9:30, but that's still early.  I went to finish up my classroom.  Funny thing is, we had to be out of there by 3, and I put in the last staple at 3 on the dot! Go figure.  Then I went to get some last minute items (i.e. lunch stuff, shoes, etc.).  When I got home, I washed my hair and straightened it.  A friend called and wanted to treat me to the movies (which is how I ended up at "Collateral").  Talked to K tonight.  He's great.  He's a decent person--hard to figure out, at times--but a very decent person.  Talked to H.  He's still crazy--still saying the same ol' same ol'...Man, I'm glad I'm such a game peeper!:)  Well, gotta go get ready for my students to "tear up" the new room--lol;).   Peace up, A-town...lol, naw just kidding:)

        For All We Know --a song sung by Donny Hathaway (I don't know if he was the original, but his version is hot!-my favorite song)      "For all we know   We may never meet again   Before you go   Make this moment sweet again   We won't say good night   Until the last minute.   I'll hold out my hand   And my heart will be in it.      For all we know   This may only be a dream.   We come, and we go   Like the ripples of a stream.   So love me, love me tonight   Tomorrow was made for some.   Tomorrow may never come,   For all we know."         This song is my absolute favorite.  I first listened to it shortly after Aaliyah died.  In one of her interviews, she said it was her favorite (I am SUCH a biter) and I decided to check it out.      I think I love this song, the way Donny sung it, because it embodies my philosophy for my life.  I just feel like I want everything here and now and I want to grab onto and possess and cherish EVERYTHING that feels good to me--or is starting to--because I never know if/when it will end.  Be it death, or even plain ol' circumstance, we don't know what can cut short the existence of all things beautiful and dear to us.  I think having this philosophy is a blessing because it allows me to pretty much never regret any of my relationships or dealings with people.  I think that I'm only bothered by the fact that so many people just don't think with this philosophy and spend so much time doing negative things (to me as well) and don't realize the fact that everything may all end before their eyes.       I treat people with love; if I do something wrong, I apologize; if I feel a certain way, I tend to let that person know--it presses you to do these things when  you listen to the truth of these lyrics.      For all I know...

       Well, tonight I decided to go to a jewelry party hosted by my sorors.  That was rather fun and it felt good to get out--even though I was DOG tired before going--I think I should do it more often.      I feel like I'm nowhere near done with the stuff in my classroom that I want to get done...but I have a friend coming to help me put some stuff up tomorrow, so that should move it along;)        My AP keeps coming on to me; it's kinda weird.  It's not that I feel threatened by him, it's just uncomfortable--not enough for me to report him or anything, though.  I guess it's harmless as long as he doesn't actually cross the boundaries--I'd never wanna get a black man in trouble for something trivial (too many of 'em are getting in trouble for the serious stuff!)      I think I'm gonna chill at home tomorrow and watch movies.  I plan to enjoy myself (remember how I'm starting to enjoy the existing moments?!:))        Well, kinda short winded tonight 'cause I'm sleepy--I will write some more in the morning...when I should probably be doing some work on my room-LOL!

       Today, one of my fellow teachers said, "Girl, your hair is getting so long!"...please tell me, what was I supposed to say???? I mean, this is a thing that is unique to the African-American girl. I guess longer hair is so unusual in our demographic that it places some special value on it. I mean, I've never had short hair, and I'm letting mine grow longer, but I didn't know that warranted a compliment from somebody--after which I'm supposed to make a reply! I've heard some of my other sisters reply "thank you," but I have made a concerted effort not to do so--what am I thanking you for?? For telling me my hair is getting longer? I dunno, that just seems like placing this huge emphasis on long (or even "good") hair over shorter hair--which is more common among my fellow BAPS- (Black American Princesses). LOL, I know to some this seems so stupid, but I guess you have to know the culture to feel me--I'm just not going to try to perpetuate any more of what society is telling my folx is "beauty".  I don't know what happened to me today, but I suddenly decided to stop worrying. I decided that what will unfold will unfold, whether I like it or not and whether I stress about it or not. I have been protecting myself for so long that I don't know how NOT to be in defense mode. But the thing I must realize is that by constantly surrounding myself with armor, I will (albeit unintentionally) be blocking the TRUE me from view.----So, my question is this: in light of the praying about this situation as part of my quest in understanding and learning more about God, could it be that He is answering me by giving me this peace? I mean, someone once told me that if I wasn't sure about God, to try praying and asking him to guide me. I wonder...   So, this week we are back at work fixing up our classrooms. I love that. Sometimes I think the darn decorating is one of my favorite parts of teaching! I really get to put my creativity to use during that time. I have so many goals and dreams for this year. I can't wait to start. It's wonderful knowing that you've chosen the right profession!  I've always believed in letting all those around me know how I feel, in case I or they should suddenly be taken away...I think that tonight I'll add on to that: I'm going to learn how to take risks--not stupid ones--but risks in faith. I'm going to learn how to put trust in tomorrow by living and loving the heck(coulda used a stronger word-lol) out of today! There's nothing, NOTHING to stop me from having my world; I'm a good person and ready to be a good person to everyone that I can be. Whew! I just gave myself quite a tall order--time to drink up!

        When you find your way to a clearing amidst the tangled woods that have become your life, you're almost afraid to be happy with it all. My mother often tells me that I don't know how to be happy. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop, some would say. Well, not anymore. I'm trying to live. I'm trying to live as fully and as safely as possible.  It's the funny saying I have about guys in my life : "When you have none, there's no one...when one comes along, there's many". Meaning: when you're alone and feeling like no one is EVER gonna love you--no one ever seems to call, be around, ask you out, etc. BUT when someone takes an interest in you, all of a sudden you have darn near a fan club. I mean new ones, "just friends" ones, even ones clawing their way out of the back of your heart. It's just not right, you know? I met several guys while I was out today and it was just kinda funny bc I can instantly tell whether or not I need to ever speak to the person again! (I try to be nice and open-minded, but when you KNOW what you want/need, why waste either person's time).  So anyway, life has felt so crazy.  You know I met K.  K and I have a cool connection as I already mentioned the other night. Well, K is great, nothing bad so far. --I don't know exactly what K wants. I definitely do feel a good connection with K, but I can never tell what the heck he's thinking.          So, like I said, I'm trying to live. I am going to spend more time on experiencing the process than on worrying about the outcome because that's what living is about. We can't spend our whole lives worrying about what our death is going to be--life is about all the days in between.
