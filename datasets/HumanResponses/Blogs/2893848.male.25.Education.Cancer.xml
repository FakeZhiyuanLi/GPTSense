      I was doing some research for my novel, searching the web for a little history of the term 'WASP' and when it was first used. One of the links that came up on Google led me to a White Nationalist web site called  urlLink Stormfront.org . I poked around it a little bit, and now I feel somewhat sick.   It's easy to forget how many hateful assholes are out there. But what's really surprising to me is the fact that they're actually literate. I mean, the spelling and grammar in their bulletin board posts (with subject lines like "Cultural Differences, or are Blacks Just Plain Stupid?") is actually not bad. Which suggests that these people read books. And if they read books, how can they be so goddamned ignorant? I suppose if the only books you read are along the lines of  Mein Kampf , you can write a decent sentence and still have Neanderthal views of race and humanity. Still, it amazes me that people who think like that aren't living in caves and eating their own excrement. As they ought to be.

      Thought some of you might like to read Paula's article at: http://www.listener.co.nz/default,2034.sm  Why doesn't everyone check and post on the blog as obsessively as I do?

      I cut and paste this quotation from Matt Bivens' "The Daily Outrage" Blog which appended to thenation.com's home page.  ______________  It's hard to improve upon the opening to this dry, tiny Reuters report :  Two rehearsals for his prime-time speech were not enough to keep US President George W. Bush from mangling the name of the Abu Ghraib prison that brought shame to the US mission in Iraq.   During the half-hour televised address, Bush mispronounced Abu Ghraib each of the three times he mentioned it ... English speakers usually pronounce [it] as "abu-grabe". But the Republican president ... stumbled on the first try, calling it "abugah-rayp". The second version came out "abu-garon", the third attempt sounded like "abu-garah".   White House aides, who described the speech as an important address on the future of Iraq, said Bush practiced twice on Monday before boarding his helicopter for his trip to the speaking venue ...   If you want to see it for yourself, go to the White House web page for the President's speech, and click on the video option. Start listening 20 minutes into the speech -- just at the two-thirds mark -- and all the various mangled iterations of Abu Ghraib come in quick succession.   Reuters gets it basically right. But they don't quite communicate the look of angst that grips the President's face at his first effort, which actually comes out:   "Abugah ...   [Pause; President bobs head in internal struggle to shake free third syllable; a truly anxious moment when one feels a stab of sympathy for the man, and wonders if he'll be able to pull it off;]   ... rayp."   [Heavy sigh of relief. He did it! Hooray! George W. "low expectations" Bush surprises and pleases us once again. And to think he only had to practice twice beforehand!]

      Items of possible interest: 1.  I and my books and my pots & pans have arrived at  urlLink my destination .  16 hours of driving over two days--decent time, uneventful.  I spent the night in  urlLink Barkeyville, PA .   2.  In Illinois there was a conspicuous amount of fluffy floating seed-carriage whatevers being blown across the interstate.  Makes me suspect that the cottonwoods are blooming.  If they are, you should take a walk in the park near where I used to live, on the corner of  urlLink Benton & Mormon Trek .  With the seeds drifting down the place looks like a set from  urlLink Legend . 3.  It's hot as fuck all on the East Coast.  My balls are sweating!  Sorry, but they are.  (No link on this one--)   4.  I must have listened to Pavement's  urlLink "Range Life"  ten times in the last 48 hours.  I love Pavement.  They seem always to be saying, "Be sad, just not too sad.  Also, be excited." 5.  I do miss Iowa.  I also hope it never goes away. 6.  I am in the middle of reading Aleksandar Hemon's  urlLink "The Question of Bruno."   I love it so far.  Two awesome descriptive fourishes that seem recently appropriate and of which I am jealous:  tomato slices at a cookout "sunk in their own slobber"; a TV in a motel room "facing the bed patiently, like a dog waiting for a treat."  (Suspiciously enough, I saw no dogs in Barkeyville.)  Anybody reading anything good lately? 7.  I love you all.  D says hi.  Be good.

      I'm sure I'm not the first one to posit this theory, but it seems to me that America's fondness for disaster and apocalypse movies, such as the about-to-open destruct-o-rama,  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow,  is akin to getting off on being spanked. In other words, as an adolescent nation we sublimate our guilty knowledge that we are too wealthy, too powerful, and eating too big a piece of the world's pie. That repressed knowledge manifests itself in a desire to see our cities flooded by tidal waves, destroyed by earthquakes, invaded by aliens, and the like. We've been a very naughty nation. Ooh, it hurts so good!  One would think that in the Post 9/11 world, this sort of sanctioned, masochistic pleasure-seeking would ebb a bit. For awhile, it seemed to. But I'm guessing Americans will throng to the theaters this weekend, salivating and slightly aroused, to watch America be destroyed (by global warming, no less) in glorious technicolor. The same way we glued ourselves to our TVs for hours on end on 9/11. Did we really need to keep seeing the planes crash into the towers, the people hurling themselves from the windows, the buildings collapsing, again and again? No, but we watched anyway. I did, too. And part of me would love to go to the theater this weekend and see a tidal wave take out Manhattan.  Somehow I suspect that if I were French (or Indian, or Korean, or Polish, or Rwandan, etc.), I wouldn't feel this way. If I were Canadian, I suppose the desire would still be there, but more in a sadistic sort of way. Burn, America! Burn! Come to think of it, I might feel that way if I were French, too. But I digress.

      I just ate at the Lincoln Cafe for the first time, and while we didn't get dessert (we brought our own bright orange Orioles birthday cake), I feel like a dope for not going sooner.  The food was most excellent.  The people were great, and while Ian wasn't working, they all said he was great, too.  The wait staff all had slices of our hideous orange cake and played Graham Parsons on the radio.  Wally the wine-guy from John's was there, and he sent us over a bottle of something good.  The people at the table next to ours ate some cake too, despite the awesome fact that they were BoSox fans.  What a great place.  I like Iowa.  I hope it never goes away.

        In Carroway's Dictionary of Symbols and Their Analysis, the entry for 'hat' includes the desire to protect or keep oneself hidden.  The bottom of the entry said, 'see also beard and armour.'  A cherished hat, however, can sometimes usefully be seen as a soul since it houses the most cherished (symbolically speaking) part of the body.   'Fire' was a four page entry and there was no 'barbecue fire' sub-heading.  Most of the entries have to do with hell, although many were also concerned with the transformative "phoenix" aspect of fire.  Under the aristocratic title of an 'Earl,' Carroway concludes by a process of inverse transference, given an Earl's lofty position in the social milieu, that sometimes the best symbolic translation of 'Earl' can mean 'little buddy.'  The act of 'throwing' something was almost universally seen as a sign of love, eg. rice at a wedding, or a pitch at a ballgame.  The exception here was the throwing of incendiary devices.   Given all of this, if somebody were to have stripped off somebody else's hat and tossed it on a barbecue flame, Carroway's analysis would suggest that a proper symbolic translation of that act would read something like this: Little Buddy, Sorry I put your hat on the barbecue coals last night.  I was attempting to transform our souls in a phoenix-esque manner and burn through the barriers that divided our love -- including drunken inarticulateness.   Glad that's cleared up.

      It probably doesn't take a PhD in dream analysis to interpret the separation anxiety in the dream I am about to relate.  I was in the Uiowa Hopsital when ER style chaos broke out.  All sorts of EMTs raced into the building  with full stretchers.  Then hospital people in blue garb started falling in the operation rooms and corridors.  They moaned theatrically in their dying.  The loudspeaker announced (helpfully) that we should all run for our lives because a virulent case of FATAL strep was on the loose.  Naturally, I ran.  Sadly as I ran, I passed many of my friends from the workshop who were in the process of succumbing to this very virulent strep.  Sucks to be you.  I won't name names other than to say that Chang (sorry Chang) was the first to go -- which makes a kind of pleasing symmetry to my experience here at the workshop but only in a perverse kind of way.  Rest assured that if you're on this blog you were a goner.  In any event, I survived the plague quite nicely thank you, and the next segment of the dream took place in the motherland where milk and honey were mine for the asking.  My advice for you all:  Run for your lives without looking back.  Iowa City is no longer safe.  Not for any of us!

      Most of you probably don't know this, but I am in love with Strong Bad. Who is Strong Bad, you ask? Quite simply, he is the awesomest guy in StrongBadia. To meet him, and see why Strong Bad has my heart, you must visit  urlLink wwww.homestarrunner.com  and check out the emails to Strong Bad. (Especially recommended: Dragon, English Paper, and Japanese Cartoon)  Strong Bad's own animated series, "Teen Girl Squad" (under 'toons,') is also highly recommended, and will give you further insight into the sensitive, mysterious, macho man that Strong Bad is. If not for Strong Bad -- and, in fact, the whole Homestarrunner gang -- I would be a much more productive and prolific writer than I am. And I thank them for that.

      I was thinking about yesterday's strange and lovely little graduation ceremony and how nice it was to have a graduation be so personal and funny. And then I was thinking, I wonder if we appeared to be a bunch of assholes to the outsiders there. You know -- a bunch of smug, self-satisfied, wise asses. And I thought: yes, probably. And I realized that it was the first time in a long while that I've felt on the inside of an incidence of smug wise-assedness rather than on the outside, looking scornfully in. And I have to say, I rather liked it. Does this make me a bad person? Please advise.

      I hate to have to break the news to you, Pete, but Troy was a stinker.  Bad dialogue, confusing action, all moneyshots and silly close-ups.  Like a porno without the penises.  I was bored.  Most suspiciously current exchange: Nestor:  If we leave now we'll lose all credibility in the region. Odysseus:  But if we stay and fight, we should do so for the right reasons. (I'm paraphrasing.  I might have added "in the region," but "credibility" was definitely in there.)  Big Bad Brad's best line:  "Everything is more beautiful because we are doomed."

      Dear Blog Team,  On behalf of all of you, I would like to offer myself a very warm welcome to the blog team!  I have joined the blog team for a variety of reasons which, mostly, are personal and not for you to know.  However at this time, I would like to explain the much debated meaning of the moniker, 'The Granimal.'  I did not choose this name.  This name was chosen for me and recently bestowed upon me by the wisest of the seven-foot Coco's.  That he was able to see into my soul and celebrate my connection to all of creation was really quite astounding.  I had thought my inner animal was well hidden from the rest of you.  In any case, please do not be afraid by the implied hostility in the name 'The Granimal.'  Hostility is a human term and has little meaning for the modern part-man, part-animal.  At this point I would like to thank you all for welcoming me to the blog team and provide you with my most febrile assurances that I will work with harmony and self-control to ensure that the honour of the blog team is at all times reflected in all of my future posts.

      Has anyone dealt with their health insurance for after graduation?  I'm trying to figure this out and wonder if I'm getting the runaround.  It's not clear that COBRA is worth it if you leave IC.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.

      I want to encourage everyone to fill out a profile. If you want to include a photo, image hosting is easy to find for free, and could prove useful for your future posting. I use  urlLink walagata , though they are occasionally frustrating.    That said, there are plenty of other good  urlLink options  out there.

      Last night I proposed marriage to Kristin, and she said, "Yes."  We are engaged.    I suppose this is a venue for sharing thoughts with one another.  I haven't really had time for that, so I'll have to get back to the blog on the matter at a later date.  All I can think at present is: I love this woman.

      Hey guys  I'm concerned, as I hope you all are, with staying in touch after graduation.  This got me thinking that we could start a blog intended mostly for each other.  The reasons to do this are many:  1)  posting on a blog is only slightly more complicated than writing an email, and only so when you want to include a picture or link.  Either way, it only took me about ten minutes to figure it all out.    2)  We can stay in touch together, as a group.  Think of it as a virtual Mill.  I think there's less pressure but more incentive to stay in touch this way.  If there are enough of us, pressure is considerably diluted; no one has to post with any particular frequency.  3)  I will do all the administrative work.  All you have to do is post.   5)  Invite anyone else who you'd think should be involved (and please explain that I didn't email them at first not because I meant to, but because these were the addresses in my contact folder).  6)  If you're unsure, just sign on.  You're not really committing to anything except for future options.    I think this will be great, but only if you guys think it will be great.  Let me know.  I'll get started on it right away, this email will be the first post.

      Thanks in part to last minute pleas by Ralph and Micheal Moore, (and also to the taped comments of a conservative candidate promising to tample on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms regarding gay marriage) the arch forces of evil in my country suffered a temporary set-back last night when the Liberal party was elected to a minority government.  Thanks for all your mental efforts on keeping Canada from the Conservative Jack Boot.  Anyone seen Fahrenheit 911 yet by the way? For Ian's sake I will not be posting riding by riding results for last night's elections.  Happy 25th Pete.  Brace yourself for a year of fantastical spiritual enlightenment.  25 is the year it all comes together.

      Prepare to grillify as I quarter-centurify.  Wednesday night, 7:30, my house (email for the address if you need it).  I'm not sure who is in town and I'm a really lazy inviter, so bring whoever in addition to any meat, beer, processed non-meat, non-processed non-meat, etc, that tickles your fancy.  Needless to say, if you are reading this blog and I don't know you, consider yourself left out.  I don't want any cokehead child molesters showing up unless I know them.

      Here's a poem.   On our way out of the parking ramp a herd of bachelorette-partying secreteries  cross our path like ducklings.  Like ducklings, except when she sees us one grabs her crotche and licks her lips. We make the mistake of eye contact.  Dozens of hands pound on the car.  I think of hail until  One celebrant makes an obscene gesture against my window with an inflatable penis the size of a premature infant.

      Buried in a comments strain, Chang asked: "Where is everybody?  What's everyone doing for the Fourth?"  Sorry, Chang, for the pitiful job at paraphrase.    Well, I wonder, too.  And I'm sure others are curious, so I'm giving the matter its own post with its own comments and saying, "Thanks, Chang, for the great idea."  I'm still in IC with Kristin Hall-soon-to-be-Gilchrist-if-I-play-my-cards-right.  We decided to stay at least another six months but probably a year in order to be married without the stress of new jobs in a new town and etc.  No date yet for the wedding as we must wait for a pastoral change at St. Patrick's.  We're both working for local test scoring syndicates.  I'm blogging, cooking, gardening, reading, and even writing a little.  For the 4th, I'm attending my cousin's wedding in Cedar Rapids.  We had a bachelor party for him on Saturday from which I fully recovered this morning (Tuesday).  Kristin is running in the Alliant Energy 8K Very Early Morning Race before the wedding.  Anyone interested in running or spectating should drop me a line.  There.  My update complete, may we hear from the rest of yous?

      I just got a gmail  urlLink account !  And guess what: other members of this blog maybe eligible too... provided they are cool enough.    Just go to  urlLink www.blogger.com , sign into BAF and if you are eligible, the offer will appear on the right column.  Try it out and let me know.  I have no idea if the offer is to all bloggers, or if there is some requirement beyond basic membership (length of membership, number of posts, etc.)  Who knows.  These things are quite valuable, going for up to $60 on ebay, and  urlLink some people will do almost anything to get one .  For me, the prestige alone is worth keeping.  I so rarely get to be on the cutting edge.  If anyone would like to gmail me, email me at my old address and I'll give you the new one.  Sorry for the paranoia, but who knows where the spammers troll and I have a virgin account to watch over.

      I don't suppose anyone's been following  urlLink this  story, by any chance?  Or  urlLink this ?  The story concerns one of our own, who gave up his literary aspirations in order to get filthy fucking rich, on the backs of thousands of elderly pensioners and mutual fund investors.  Sounds good, no?  I'm thinking the new workshop library should be expanded to include a jacuzzi.  Oh, and our friend the Hurricane should ask for a raise.    Hope all is well with everyone.  Sorry I haven't posted more.  I'll invoke my all-purpose excuse: wedding planning.  Other than that, I've just been kickin' it here in the IC, making desserts, making up for lost time with Nicki, getting my ankle horribly sprained by Alistair Moock, and reading, little by little, Grant's exhaustive history of Canadian electoral politics.

      Our garden is thriving on the south side of town in a park I doubt you knew existed.  You are all invited to peruse the lushness and admire it in comparison to neighboring plots.  The park is called Wetherby and is found at the end of Taylor (just East of Broadway) off of Highway 6.  Our plot is number 6.  When you visit, pull a weed or two from the tomato patch if you find any, would you please?   The veggies growing inside our rabbit fencing have made their homes in little rows and on mounds and in patches.  After some time in the sun, bending close to carrot shoots and reaching beneath nervous-system-like broccoli, I have wished that these little living things actually possessed the voices my imagination attributes to them.  I find it somewhat unbelievable that beautiful food can be so simple.  The work we did and nurture we provided was minimal considering the results.    What’s new in the garden?  The tomatoes are staked, morning glories are planted along the back fence, corn is sprouting, one pepper plant has produced a single pepper, we’ve harvested a few onions and sautéed them for wonderful pasta sauces using the greens of the leaves as well as the onions themselves.  Old news: the rabbit fence continues to protect the lettuces (whose imaginary plant voices resemble your corpulent eldest auntie), fried green tomatoes are anticipated in our kitchen by the end of June, and a neighboring gardener offered praise on the pleasing appearance of our plot.    In other news: I’ve been putting many of your leftovers and left-behinds to rather tasty use.  Upon their moves Tom and Leigh gave me a crock-pot, Grant and Kate a food processor and spices, and someone left in my freezer a package of turkey bratwurst.  In the crock I simmered the turkey brats for hours in two cans of beer with whole cloves of garlic and sprinklings of several other spices.  The tender and flavorful result will never be exactly duplicated, as I don’t record my recipes.    Enough for now?  Probably.  Sorry for my laxity in posting.  I make no promises to be a better blogger, though you may all be assured that I wish I were.

      Please, everyone of us, use single-minded strength of will to make TD join our commune.  Today he should have no choice but to sit down at his computer and register at blogspot -- TD: "Why do I have such a strong desire to sit down at my computer and register at the blogspot?"  Yes that is that is the wish of the Borg.  As for the rest of you non-contributing borgmates, I am the Borgmaster, [not to be confused with Pete who is the Blogmaster] and I command you to write.  Chang, Gillymonster, Possum, Michelle, SER (anyone else?) all of you will feel a strong desire to sit down at your computers and update the baby-borg on your whereabouts and doings -- All: "Why do we feel such a strong desire to sit down at our computers and communicate our whereabouts and doings?"  In order not to be a hypocrite, let the Borgmaster offer this wee update. I'm still stranded in Moose Jaw.  Tomorrow, Calgary.  The day after that, Vancouver.  Kate and I finally found out where we're going to be in Japan, beautiful Hondo City!  It's just off the south eastern coast of Kyushu island on one of the Amakusa islands.  It's a moutainous, coastal city of 40,000 and very rural which I suppose will be like IC without the football players or the hotpants but with a lot more water and moutains.  We like visitors.  Book now with your travel agent.  The rent for our three tatami aptmnt will be CDN $212/month so you might even consider saving up and moving in next door.  Otherwise, I've been doing my best to stay on the right side of Kate's family and to get informed about the upcoming federal election.  Last night was the leaders' french langauge debate on tv.  This is quite a comic event as none of the leaders speaks french fluently.  This kind of french is my kind of french.  Bonjour tout le monde.  Je m'appele Jack Layton et je voudrais etre le "Prime Minister" de Canada.  Tonight is the English language debate.  Those Blogmates with satellite tv should prepare yourselves for a real treat.  At the moment, it looks as though there will be a conservative party majority -- the conservatives are planning to spend more on the military, Americanize health-care, ban abortion, and make gay unions illegal, not to mention getting tough on crime and drugs.  Anyone who told me you'd move to Canada if Bush got in again, please use your impressive powers of mental control to elect the NDP or Greens.  Canadians: "Why do we feels an overpowering urge to vote for NDP or Green?"  If the conservatives win, plan on on staying where you are for the next 1-5 yrs.  This is an interesting election year since the less powerful parties are showing well in the polls and are expected to split the vote on the left.  There are five contenders.  In addition to the Conservatives there are the liberals who have been in power for the past forever and who presided over the country's biggest ever $ scandal which has been coming to light over the past year; the Bloc Quebecois whose single goal is to dismantle the federation (they only run candidates in Quebec);  the NDP who are very left and who I wish would win a majority but will happen when pigs fly; and the ever likable Greens.  I'm hoping for a minority government situation where there's a coalition between the liberals and the NDP.  The liberals need to be punished for their corruption and an NDP government by itself would likely get us invaded by a re-elected Bush.  So far since coming home my polictical highlight has been when longterm NDP MP (Member of Parliament)Svend Robinson stepped down after stealing a $50,000 necklace at an auction.  He turned himself in to the police the next day when he couldn't get in touch with the auction house which was closed for the weekend.  Miss you all.

      Would anyone still in IC be comfortable giving me a trim around the ears?  It shouldn't require too much skill, but A is unduly worried about messing it up.  Oh yeah- we're back.  Still jetlagging, but if there's anything going on tomorrow night, let us know.

      Last night, Alastair and I watched "Grease," which is on TV basically every day on one channel or another, on the Women's Entertainment Network, AKA "We." The little animation that came up before and after commercial breaks referred to the showing of the film as "Cinematherapy."  This set me off on a little rant about how insipid and unfeminist and annoying the current women's self-help / psychobabble / Oprahfied /Bridget Jones pop culture is, and how infantilizing I find it to constantly be told to "go girl!" and "get self-actualized" (what does that  mean ?) and eat ice cream and burn scented candles when I'm feeling victimized by men/work/my weight/etc. (As for personality quizzes, don't even get me started...)  So then there was a commercial for a show called "Bridezillas" which seems to be about bitchy real-life brides who throw tantrums when the cocktail napkins for their reception are the wrong shade of Ecru, thus ruining the wedding they've dreamed of all their lives. (Jane rants some more, while patient, long-suffering Alastair goes and gets another beer.)  But this was the best part: the voice over said, "That's tomorrow night, on WE."  On We.  On We.  On We.  Say it three times fast....YES. Exactly. Coincidence? I think not.  I rest my case.

      Can somebody explain the IRC system to me?  I tried to purchase a couple at the local post office today and the woman said I needed to know exactly how much it costs to send a letter from the other country.  This does not sound true to me.  I suspect that she didn't like the look of me.

      My DSL is finally operative, and so, as promised, more items of possible interest: 1.  How glad was I to hear yesterday that Verizon's grip on the teletech industry will only become tighter in the years to come?  Not so glad.  They needed a month of lead-in time to move our phone line, and still they were late with it.  We didn't even change our phone number! 2.  Have you heard the new joint from the roots?  damn that shit is hot.  East.  Coast. 3.  Ryan also just sent me "Lifted or..." by Bright Eyes.  Track 2's pretty great. 4.  Did anyone read the article about the giant squids in the New Yorker a couple weeks ago?  I read it last night.  I bet they're smarter than we think they are.  They're like giant brains floating around in the ocean, and  hiding from us.  Spooky.  Henrick Herzberg especially. 5.  Speaking of giant brains, has anyone read Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris"?  I really liked it.  A few months ago I watched Tarkovsky's adaptation and thought it was decent.  Word on the street is that when Lem saw Soderberg's version he took back everything bad he'd ever said about Tarkovsky. 6.  Shrek 2 was fun.  Puss in boots, yes.  I also recently watched and loved Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train." 7.  I just read a bunch of stories by Peter Taylor.  He was a monster of a writer!  How come I've never heard of this guy. 8.  So 7 was a veiled plea for recommendations and brief reviews.  It's one thing the lot of us are good for, for God's sake.  9.  I'm getting carried away, though.  In the future I promise not to post as many of my own. 10.  Have I mentioned that my apartment came with a piano? 11.  Rob Neyer's column on ESPN.com is no longer free.  Bastards!  My baseball IQ just plummeted.  12.  Reagan had a teabag coming to him that never got administered.  And that's the last that I'll say about all that.     Toodles-

      When the news of Reagan's passing came, I was reminded of his re-election bid in 1984 when my parents took me and my brother to see him speak at a rally at our town hall in (mostly Republican) Fairfield, Connecticut. I was nine or ten, and boy, was I excited.   My brother and I waved our flags and cheered "Four more Years!" We jeered the Mondale supporters and liked the Republicans with the "Fritz Busters" signs (Mondale's face fashioned into the Ghostbusters logo). We made our parents rush us down the street afterward so we could wave to his limo as it passed.   Why this outpouring of GOP enthusiasm from two tykes such as ourselves, raised on PBS and whole wheat bread? Well, he was the PRESIDENT!! What did we care if he was funding the slaughter of villagers in Guatemala? Nuclear proliferation? What's that? Iran-Contra huh? He liked Jellybeans and we wished our grandpa was more like him. We didn't care what our parents thought about him -- we didn't even know! (I have since learned that my father voted for him both times, something I like to give him shit about when he spews venom over George W. and sends checks to Kerry.)  What is my point? Oh, I don't know. I guess just this: if you see cute little kids on TV in the next few months' campaign coverage, cheering for Shrub, don't judge them too harshly or take them too seriously. They may turn out to be card-carrying, bleeding heart, pinko liberals like me. As for the kids cheering for Kerry -- well, let's hope they turn out that way too.

       No, it isn'the chocolate, or the bread, or the cosmopolitan attitudes.   It's the preponderance of swords, maces, plate mail and other pre-modern instruments of death/death avoidance.  In America, you only see these things on the cover of heavy metal LPs and inside Dungeons and Dragons manuals.    As a lifelong purveyor of both heavy metal LPs and Dungeons and Dragons manuals, I feel like I'm coming home for the first time.  I'm telling you; this shit is everywhere.  I almost bought a turkish sabre in budapest flea market but I thought better of carrying it around for a couple weeks, let alone across a few borders.    Today, in a castle, we saw a set of scale mail with fucking wings on the back.  Truly. It had feathers and everything.  Bad ass.  You could put Jerry Lewis in there and I wouldn't fuck with him.      We'll be back next week.  I hope everyone is well.

      So I just got back this week from my 10th reunion at Princeton (that experience may be worth a different posting, once I've sorted out my complex feelings of nostalgia with Tom Derr, who has a doctorate in the subject - could someone force him to join this blog, please?).  I also saw the article in the NYTimes a couple of days ago about the Princeton senior who did an analysis of short stories in the New Yorker for her Operations Research thesis ( urlLink article here  ).  These two things reminded me that you can go onto a Princeton website and look up anyone's senior thesis.  Here are just a few:  Donald Rumsfeld '54: The Steel Seizure Case of 1952 and Its Effects on Presidential Powers (Politics) Brooke Shields '87: The Initiation: From Innocence to Experience: The Pre-Adolescent/Adolescent Journey in the Films of Louis Malle, "Pretty Baby" and "Lacombe Lucien" (Romance Languages and Literatures)  Jonathan Safran Foer '99: Before Reading The Book of Antecedents: Intention, Literary Interpretation, and the Hypothesized Author (Philosophy)  More  urlLink here .  Rummy was on campus for his 50th reunion, incidentally, although I never saw him.  I did see a guy I know from the class of '54, who's been married 5 times and told me that Rummy was "the best man at his worst wedding."  I did not investigate further.    Another amusing  urlLink time-waster :  Find out which candidates your neighbors are supporting!  (Edit:  Added Hyperlinks.  PC)

      Hi All,  Kate and I made it back safely to MJ around two this morning.  About thirty minutes out of IC we drove straight through the wickedest storm I've ever seen.  I looked over at Kate and said, "Do you think this is a fucking Tornado we're driving through?"  It looked like nuke-u-ler winter outside.  The only colour I remember was grey.  That's when we tuned the radio to an Emergency Broadcast Beep and a man saying a Tornado was touching down within miles of Vinton and that if you were in the area, you were to seek immediate shelter behind concrete walls.  Go little Ford Escort Go!  And it did.  We ran into a Pizza Hut yelling Tornado! Tornado!  The people there just looked up at us and kept on feeding.  We hung out for a while until the T-advisory was let down then made our way home.  The advisory said Iowa City itself might see some action.  Did it?  I hope everyone keeps on posting, because I'm feeling sad to have left Iowa.

      Should I become a postman?  I'd have to give up Cheeba because they  definitely  drug test, and philosophical objections, gallons of water and internet miracle flushes aside, it would likely be many months of ascetic self-denial before I could even  seriously consider taking the civil service exam.  But the pay is  good, and I could grow that handle-bar moustache I've always wanted.    Unrelatedly, I'm glad and mildy self-consciousthat in my two-week absence everyone has been posting so much.   I guess I was smothering you guys.    Chicago is great.  I'll write more about that later.  If anyone wants to pick up some impeccable slack until I have my own internet access, please let me know.   Then again, at this point, I've probably lost all my readers anyway.    Barrack Obama is my new hero.   I know Kerry has adopted Langston Hughes's line, "Let America Be America Again," but watching this badass speak, the better line seemed to be "Let the Democrats be the Democrats again; the party they never were."    Did anyone else catch David Brooks's comparison of Obama to Tiger Woods?  What an ass.  Whenever I see him on Jim Lehrer, he talks like he's fighting back the self-conscious and bitter tears of a playground victim.       I'll see some of you in Philly.  If anyone wants to come see Modest Mouse and Deathcab for cutie in Chicago on August 14, you can stay with me.

      &nbsp; I finally had the chance to go into downtown Boston yesterday and soak up a little bit of DNC hubub. The city was decidedly abuzz. Secret service, cops, and&nbsp;troopers&nbsp;everywhere. But no major traffic snarls or chaos. Actually, it was all quite festive (machine guns aside).  I had two "celebrity" sightings: Dick Gephart and Mike Dukakis. Both were just walking down the street with one or two other people and I did double takes both times. Not exactly John Cusack or Matt Damon (both also in town for the occasion), and definitely not Jon Stewart, but at least I got a little bit of that goofy frisson that comes with spotting someone famous. I also waited for about fifteen minutes in front of an outdoor&nbsp;restaurant in Quincy Market (a place nobody from Boston ever goes, incidentally) because there was a rumor that Bill and Hillary were coming. They didn't show, but I chatted with a congressman from Georgia who pointed out a number of senators and congressman in the restaurant, some of whom looked familiar.  Otherwise, there were lots of people with big plastic DNC tags hanging around their necks (Delegates, I presume) and lots of flair all over their shirts. ("Office Space" fans will know what I mean.) There were some small coteries of protesters, most for left-leaning causes, a big group of Falun Gong-ers,&nbsp;plus the requisite pro-lifers with bloody fetus posters. What I found most fascinating were the lone ranging activists -- just individual people carrying around signs or passing out fliers.   Sadly, I was unable to join the Billionaires for Bush march as my alter ego, Mimi Furst, due to the fact that I&nbsp;am overloaded with work for my CTY course (incidentally, did anyone read the 'Nerd Camp' article in last week's NYer? That's the same&nbsp;organization I'm working for).   Did anyone catch Clinton's speech on Monday night? Man, that guy can talk. But Barack Obama, the Justin Timberlake of the Democratic Party, is one helluva rhetorician himself.   I don't know. Can we win this thing? I am envious of all you folks who get to vote in Iowa and actually have an impact. Voting Dem. in Massachusetts is like spitting into the ocean. (Another thing I plan to do, soon.)  Over and out.  &nbsp;

      I read this blog a lot, but I don't write on it much.&nbsp; My life, you know, is sort of mundane.&nbsp; But, I have some bad news, and since Fern was the most perfect dog ever (sorry Lucy, Annie, Harvey, et al) I had to let the world know, in at least this small way, that she is gone.&nbsp; She started having seizures one day on our afternoon walk, and after four days at the emergency vet's office, in and out of consciousness, she came home with me.&nbsp; She died under an elm tree on Summit Street, very peacefully, and we buried her out at Jan's (Jan at the Workshop) farm near Solon.&nbsp;   It's been over a week now, and I'm past the stage of being sad and lonely and tearful and sort of angry, although I still think I see her on the couch when I come home at night.&nbsp;   God.&nbsp; What a great dog she was.   Okay.&nbsp; Remember when I said I'm past that bad stage?&nbsp; I guess that was a lie.&nbsp; But I thought you all should know, since you all met her at some point, and experienced that big, mellow head pressed against your knee.

      Lo for the settling of&nbsp;the righteouserness&nbsp;between Philly&nbsp;or Boston,&nbsp;for the unwinding of the&nbsp;stand-offing between Austin and IC, for the Kerry versus Bushing, and the driving&nbsp;of cars with tanks of fat-fry grease, MJ will descend like an angel descending to make peace&nbsp;amongst the Americanites.  Donought&nbsp;of the&nbsp;sky at night,&nbsp;the peace she brings&nbsp;will be&nbsp;infinite, dusted in sprinkles.  Enough cleverality/stupidiatlity,&nbsp;I too have not posted much recently to the Blog of Blogs and will deign to do so now.  Kate and I are readying ourselves for Japan.&nbsp; She leaves in a week, I the week after.&nbsp; We've been catching up with friends and their children over the past few weeks.&nbsp; Why is it that whenever you leave a&nbsp;friend alone for two or more years, they reappear with three or more children?&nbsp; Anyone on this blog with fertility issues wanting fecundity, should just make sure to check in with me&nbsp;after May 2006.  Actually, it might be easier to go back to being clever now that I realize I don't have all that much to say.&nbsp; I could pretend that I've been losing myself in rereading both the Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon series but such would just be useless cleverness.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have finally been reading William T. Vollman's The Royal Family -- which was on the remainder table at Prairie Lights.&nbsp; He's a strange writer.&nbsp; When I read him,&nbsp;the little Offut/Ethan on my shoulder cry foul&nbsp;(pleasurable in and of itself).&nbsp; Economy of word is not Vollman's gift but his general sense of over the top has always been mesmerizing.&nbsp; Does anyone else have thoughts on Vollman.&nbsp; I kept telling Derr to read him while in IC.&nbsp; Now I'm not so certain.  I probably could write a long passage on the meaning of home, that's what I've been thinking about lately -- as my sense of America&nbsp;(and my involvement in her politics)&nbsp;recedes and is replaced&nbsp;with time in&nbsp;my default landscape (cedars, hemlock, and firs)&nbsp;-- but I won't bore you&nbsp;all with the details.  Anyway,&nbsp;a question to end, does anyone on the blog have the authority to invite people to g-mail.&nbsp; If so, think fondly of me since I'd like never again to delete another email.  Hope everyone's doing well.&nbsp;

      &nbsp; I've been remiss in posting for a good while now due to the tumult and exhaustion of moving. But here we are, back in the greater Boston metropolitan area, and here I am, back on the blog. Mostly, both big&nbsp;Al and I are suprememely&nbsp;disoriented and tired and discombobulated. But slowly, the reality that this is our home is sinking in. A few observations: &nbsp; I went for a walk at dusk last night&nbsp;and caught a whiff of subtley but distinctively salt-water-scented air. That was nice.&nbsp; Not that I have anything against the smell of manure, but, you know. &nbsp; There are a lot more Kerry than Bush bumper stickers on cars here. But a lot more cars in general, and they move a helluva lot faster and more frantically. &nbsp; A much larger percentage of the young&nbsp;women around town -- and this I find especially comforting after two years of being surrounded by spray-on-tan, midriff-baring,&nbsp;bottle-blonde&nbsp;Iowa&nbsp;undergrads -- are curvy and pale and wear cool&nbsp;clothes.&nbsp;Less makeup, too.&nbsp;(Foundation? What's that?) &nbsp; Our car insurance is going to cost us twice as much. Mother fuck. &nbsp; I can hear church bells from our house when the windows are open. &nbsp; I miss our herb garden, and all the blue jays and cardinals in&nbsp;our old&nbsp;backyard. But I really like being able to get good&nbsp;takeout&nbsp;Indian food, which we had the other night. &nbsp; I miss all of you guys, but I'm sure as hell glad not to be in the Workshop anymore.  &nbsp; In any case, we have an absurdly huge apartment, so please let us know if you're ever nearby and need a place to crash. (That goes for you, too, FBI guy....) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Dear Iowa Mafia,  I am sponsoring an essay contest.   You are all strongly encouraged to participate.   First prize is a cash award of a presently undisclosed amount.   The contest rules are as follows.   Well, before I get to those, I’ll give you a little history, a little background, implicit in which the aforementioned contest rules may, or might, be.  When I asked Frank Conroy to write me a letter of recommendation, he said he would be pleased to do so, wholeheartedly and without reservation.   However, there was, or is, what I perceive to be a catch.   He said that he is, in any case, pleased to write any graduate of the Workshop a letter of recommendation because the level of discourse at Iowa is of an order of magnitude to ipso facto warrant one, but that (and here’s the perceived catch) the student himself must write the letter.   That is, I write the letter, send it to him, he laughs, edits, files it away. It turns out, however, that I am too self-loathing to recommend myself, let alone to assume the voice of Conroy in the doing so.   The letter, Frank said, is nothing more than a form letter, one that should (or perhaps he said “could”) end with: I recommend….wholeheartedly and without reservation.  &nbsp;  In fairness to Pete, I asked him to write this letter for me, and he said he’d be pleased to do so, wholeheartedly and without reservation, but that was weeks ago, and Pete, by his own admission, is an out-of-sight-out-of-mind sort of guy, a poor corresponder, and calls to mind a passage from Proust:   “The process which had begun in [Pete] – and in [him] a little earlier only than it must come to all of us – was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world.”  &nbsp;  I suppose it’s possible no one will when this esteemed contest, but I hope that’s not the case.   I encourage collaboration and plagiarism, and should it be the case that I end out using not a single essay but a combination of essays, bits and pieces from here or there, I will divide the amount of the currently undisclosed cash award by the number of words in the final eclectism, and pay each author on a wordly basis.  For you organized thinkers out there (Sarah, Michelle) we're talking three or four minutes of effort.   But, I understand, wholeheartedly, that people have other shit to do.  I wish you all the best of luck in this prestigious contest.   And remember that, given the level of discourse, you’re all winners to me.  Cheers,  Thomas E. Derr, Olympic Hopeful        &nbsp;

      Has anyone else seen  urlLink this contest  advertised in Vanity Fair?&nbsp; I saw it in the issue that has David Beckham on the cover and a mustachioed Tom DeLay in its inner pages.&nbsp; For those too lazy to link through, it's for $15,000 and a trip to an Italian writers' colony (not to be confused with an Italian-writers' colony), the deadline is July 31, and you have to explain the character of the American people (such as it is) to the rest of the world in 1,500 words.&nbsp; Submissions are via email.&nbsp;   Montblanc is sponsoring it, perhaps as some sort of feint at improving Franco-American relations in the wake of the Freedom-Fries spasm.&nbsp; Judging, alas, is blind, so the staffers at Vanity Fair can't be impressed by our Workshop credentials, only by the meaning, sense, and clarity of our sentences (and perhaps not even then).

      Due to the sudden influx of high school children in my life, both wanna-be writers and wanna-be lawyers (interesting sidenote--wanna-be writers infinitely more mature than wanna-be lawyers), time to post has been limited.&nbsp; And the imagination hasn't been working properly either, which spells doom for a certain as-yet-unwritten novel. &nbsp; Re the latter, I query you, my blog-reading friends: I'm curious to know, now that you're full-fledged denizens of the blogosphere--what blogs are you reading?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; What is it that draws you to a blog in the first place, and what keeps you there?&nbsp; Trust me when I say this is a more important question than it sounds, at least for me. &nbsp; Here's the bonus: Paul Ingram, of Prairie Lights fame, has started a blog, so those of you no longer in Iowa who are still looking for recommendations need look no further.&nbsp; Here's the link:  urlLink http://misternouse.blogspot.com .&nbsp; Enjoy!

      Just kidding.&nbsp; I have nothing to say about Martha or her corporation; I just like saying "Omnimedia."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, though, it was a little weird that she plugged her magazines and products in her post-sentencing remarks.&nbsp; In any case, I just wanted to say hello to all of you and give you a tedious update.&nbsp; I am pleased to see that Derrcules has joined the blog, but has he posted?&nbsp; Are the Grranimal and Kate in Japan (or, should I say, Nihon de)?  &nbsp;  I have forgiven Blogspot for getting a Trojan Horse onto my computer from a malevolently altered pop-up ad.&nbsp; Actually, I'm still a little mad, but the allure of your witty remarks was too potent.&nbsp;   Anyhoo, here are a few things:  &nbsp;  1. I have been going to lots of weddings in California.&nbsp; This has adversely affected my finances, although this impact is less severe than the negative financial impact of actually getting married yourself, not that my finances have recovered from getting married, but at least I'm not&nbsp;getting married more than once this year or, ideally, in any future year or, really ideally, not ever again.  &nbsp;  2.&nbsp;I have long thought that conspiracy theorists give too much credit to the alleged conspirators by believing that they are actually both crafty and organized enough to execute something complicated, and that collusion is more likely to occur after something shifty has occurred.&nbsp; That having been said, I find myself these days convinced that the Bush Administration is stage-managing intricate conspiracies at all times.&nbsp; I totally buy this current rumor that Bush will dump Cheney late in the game (for health or other reasons) and replace him with someone more palatable, thereby&nbsp;ensuring a victory.&nbsp; I can only hope that McCain and Powell hate W enough that they'd never go for it.&nbsp; In any case, I can't decide if I'm losing it and will soon be setting up a card table with pamphlets and diagrams&nbsp;on the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, or if our current President and his cronies are actually this clever after all&nbsp;and are managing to set in motion such plots while also managing to escape the notice of most people.  &nbsp;  3. The Terrapin in Iowa City has shut down, but apparently the overcaffeinated owners won't admit it and keep telling people that it's "closed for remodeling," when, in fact, it's deader than a peeled egg.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was away, but I heard that an article appeared over the weekend in one of the papers, and, in it, the brothers contended that they were bought out or something because the landlord had received an offer he couldn't refuse.&nbsp; It's all strange.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  4. There was a shooting in the Red Light District!&nbsp; A clerk at the Adult Marketplace was shot by a robber, but he's alive and they caught the dude who did the shooting.&nbsp; In other Iowa news, some farmer near Pella was arrested for growing loads of poppies in the rows in between vegetables.&nbsp; Perhaps he can lend his business savvy to the owners of the Terrapin.  &nbsp;  5.&nbsp; Back to politics.&nbsp; Are all you people registered to vote?&nbsp; Are you volunteering with your local Democratic parties?&nbsp; Are you giving money - even a pittance - to campaigns?&nbsp; I really hope so.&nbsp; Anyone in the Boston or NYC areas, incidentally, should check out the upcoming marches by Billionaires for Bush at  urlLink www.billionairesforbush.com .&nbsp; They're also doing a limo tour through the swing states, and will be at the Iowa State Fair on August 18.  &nbsp;  6.&nbsp;This summer, I have read Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem (good, but not as good as I'd expected based on what people had told me - it may just be a case of disappointment due to inflated expectations), Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh (loved it), Little Children by Tom Perrotta (enjoyable but ultimately sort of light, even though there were nicely surprising observations sprinkled throughout - I just can't remember any of them after completing it), and The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon (felt sort of like some of the odd dreams - and now conspiracy theories - I have).&nbsp; I am about to embark upon another Waugh novel, Scoop.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  7.&nbsp; But no one reads else&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp; What are we to do?&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/weekinreview/11mcgr.html?ex=1090641600&amp;en=48072a44fb858d95&amp;ei=5006&amp;partner=ALTAVISTA1   &nbsp;  Your pal,  SER

      This morning I finished Middlemarch, and man oh man was I not disappointed.  How much did I want Dorothea and Lydgate to be real people?  This much.  (Imagine a gesture indicative of vast hugeness.)  Good God, I was so deeply moved so often that I find it hard to talk about.  5 stars from this reviewer.  It's a book about idealisim, ultimately, I think.  Why it is dangerous and necessary and problematic, etc.  Does a good job of undercutting (and sometimes fulfilling) romantic expectations to that end.  It was just so complex and real, despite the stuffy strangeness of that world.  Anyway, enough about that.  I started Breece Pancake's collection this afternoon.  I thought Jim's introduction was very good.  I also just watched The Barbarian Invasions, which I liked a lot.  Made me cry, but I'm a sucker.  And a question--how is one supposed to care for copper pots?  Anybody?  (Chang?)  D and I were given a set at her bridal shower.  They're copper outside, stainless inside, with an aluminum core.  I've gotten them all spotty already, and D left one on a hot burner, which caused the copper to sort of blister.  Is that normal?  I'll leave you all with one of my favorite lines from Middlemarch (from p. 686, in the Finale):  "He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains."  Anyway, it's much more devastating in context.  PS--Our basil is doing very well, thankyou.

      The  urlLink big city folks  make IC seem a lot more interesting than it really is.  (Rock on with the mention of the Lincoln, though).   Now that we've (sort of) moved on: do you guys really like this place?  The workshop experience and the people aside,  I kinda fucking hate it.  The problem is not the midwest-- I lived in Madison for four years and loved it-- it isn't even  urlLink Herky , though I wouldn't really mind if that mangy vulture were  urlLink murdered in a ritual fashion .    The real problem is  urlLink Coralville .  The problem is TWO enormous but horrible china buffets across the street from one another, the mini-mall of America, the fact that a town was basically invented to house fast food restaurants, shitty hotels for visiting college athletes, landlord offices and strip clubs that are difficult to locate.  (Not to mention the most evil dog-trainer I have ever met.)  Sometimes I wonder if Coralville was modelled after a level of Purgatory, the particular place you go for driving like a jerk, or for masturbating too much.     Maybe I'm overreacting, but when I think about Coralville too much, I get depressed.  And this isn't a leftist, elitist, whateverist rant.  it just depresses me.  Everything that is wrong with Coralville is everything that is wrong with this country, this world, and me.  If I ever write a manifesto, Coralville will be of central and metaphorical significance.

      I started  urlLink Natasha  yesterday.  I've read  two stories and both were great.  I know a  urlLink lot  of  urlLink reviews  have compared Bezmozgis to Isaac Babel, and even though this is just the sort of comparison that annoys the hell out of me, like I'm buying a brand or something, it's actually pretty accurate.  I like Babel, I like Bezmozgis, though the latter's tendency to write about stoned ethnics and their dogs is troubling to me on a personal level.  I never thought someone would beat me to the market with  that  subject matter.  Fucker.

      Are you asking or quizzing?  If it's the latter, then I've cheated.  I googled the phrase and found that it comes from Sir Thomas Browne's   urlLink Hydriotaphia  , or  Urn Burial ,or,  a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns Lately Found in Norfolk .  It looks like good stuff.  As for this Uriel, a google search turned up  urlLink this Eurasian mountain mammal  that looks to be something between a deer and a ram.   urlLink Here is an encyclopedia article on the horned bastards .  That said, the passage does seem to indicate Urial is a single person, as far as that goes, all I could find was  urlLink a klezmer musician  and  a lethally injected  urlLink murderer  in TX, both post-dating Elliot by many many years.    Anyone else have any ideas?  This is fun.

      More items: 1.  I am noticing that Derrcules has bumped Hurricane Earle from the top of the pile.  I am not amused.  But in other news, Derrcules--where have you been all my life?  Can you make my computer go faster? 2.  Since last we spoke I saw Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes, which I very much enjoyed.  At first I thought the premise was cheesy and overly-mannered, but by about a third of the way through I was thoroughly won over.  Jarmusch has a wonderful sense of humor, I think.  The scene with Bill Murray was off the hook!  I also watched Down By Law, which I liked, although I do get tired of Roberto Benigni pretty quickly.  Possibly an explanation for my resistance to C & C? 3.  Of course I also saw The Chronicles of Riddick.  Don't ask. 4.  Is the numbered posting getting old?  I think I'll stop with it after this post. The little Offutt who dances on my shoulder is telling me it's just an excuse not to write the transitions. 5.  My herbs are going strong.  The basil is a big bully.  Will have to be isolated.  I planted tomatoes and peppers, too, but the sociopathic squirrel in my backyard (it's the one who fell out of the tree, I am certain) uprooted and ate all four of them.  Seriously, I caught him in the act--I walked out to my kitchen in the morning just in time to see him leap from my rail with leaves and stems and a dirty ganglion of roots all spilling from his little mouth.  The little guy looked too ridiculous to make me angry.  (OK, I got a little angry.) 6.  Michelle, Middlemarch is tremendous.  I have had my socks knocked off on every page.  She's continually expanding on our understanding of her characters without ever seeming inconsistent or reticent--they're all just interesting and complex enough to warrant the attention.  I've seen her even give five pages of exposition on a character she'd thoroughly introduced two hundred pages earlier.  Awesome!  She also makes these hilarious and compassionate authorial asides.  Anyways, I like it.  Here's a section I've been saving for blog (from Chapter 41, p. 340 in my edition):      "Who shall tell me what may be the effect of writing?  If it happens to have been cut in stone, though it lie face downmost for ages on a forsaken beach, or 'rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many conquests', it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:--this world being apparently a huge whispering-gallery.  As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe.  To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the Sun, the one result would be just as much a coincidence as the other."  Anyways, I'll give the final word when I've finished it.  Extra credit to anyone who can 1. identify whom she is quoting in line 3; and 2. tell me who this Uriel is.  (You see, I even think in numeric sequences.)

      Anyone want to read the same book and talk about it on the blog?  It needn't be a "club" per se, because it doesn't matter if we all do it.  But I was thinking: I miss the  urlLink spiritual guidance ,  urlLink the softspoken wisdom , and the  urlLink incisive wit  that I enjoyed/was compelled to sit through every Tuesday afternoon for the last two years.    Some books I will selfishly suggest because I've been meaning to read them:  St. Augustine's Pigeon (Evan S. Connell) The Iliad (Homer) Mickellson's Ghost (John Gardner) Turn of the Screw (DH Lawrence) Death Comes For the Archbishop (Willa Cather) Natasha (David Bezmozgis)  Or, you know, whatever.  I say we keep it informal:  Whoever wants to makes an effort to read whatever book we agree on and then posts on it when they feel compelled to.  Let me know if you're interested; I'll be happy to do whatever work needs to be done here.

      The Cedar Rapids Kernels play at home this Sunday, July 4, at 5 pm. The big Moock and I will be there, in the lawn seating area, eating brats and drinking beer. (It's a small area -- you'll find us.) Tickets for the lawn are only $5 and can be purchased at the door. (We went last year on the 4th, and it wasn't close to being sold out.)   After the game there are fireworks, but there's some serious lag time between when the game ends and the 'works begin, unfortunately. So, bring a book, your knitting, your conversational prowess, etc.  If you haven't been to a Kernels game yet during your Iowa sojourn, this is something you absolutely must do!! The mascot is a big gray (?) kernal of corn. And if that ain't enough to get you there, what is?  Hope to see you there. We can give 2 people a ride, if there are any takers. If you need directions or info, see the  urlLink Kernels' Website .

      The Scudder Road Circus and Literary Journal (director: P. Morris/animal trainer: T. Moody) has arrived safely in its new home in New Orleans. Apparently, it's inferno-hot here pretty much all the time, and thunderstorms approach from the south and north as well as the west.  The choice of events and activities here is a little overwhelming. Last week, for example, we could choose between a Voodoo Discussion, a Hurricane Preparedness Seminar and the Mermaid Gardens Flea Market & Polka Party. (We went to see the Finn Brothers at the House of Blues last Tuesday, and to White Linen Night, a street party organized by the art galleries in the warehouse district, on Saturday).  When the cable guy is called Claude and the mailman is called Cartier, you know you're not in Iowa City anymore.

      Greetings, everyone.  I've been at another wedding in the San Francisco area.  While there, I went to a Kerry fundraiser, ate Ethiopian food, purchased jeans, and so forth.  Anyway, here is the above-referenced list:  1. I saw no Bush-Cheney bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one.  I thought I saw one, but on closer inspection, it said "Bush-Orwell." I get the point, but Orwell obviously does not even facetiously belong  on  a totalitarian ticket but rather outside of it, providing prescient commentary.  In any case, I also saw no Nader-Camejo bumper stickers in San Francisco, not even one, which is quite different from 2000.  People in SF are big into making their own political posters and hanging them in their windows for passers-by to see.  Despite the number of stylish graphic-arts types in SF, most of these window displays look as though they were word-processed using some sort of manifesto software and/or on an Apple II-C, and printed on an old-school dot-matrix printer where the paper has strips of those little holes at the edges that hook onto the printer and are later torn off.  2. I saw on IowaBlog that there's a rumor that Frank will retire after this coming year and that the university is in discussions with Jonathan Franzen to come in.  Does anyone know whether this is true?  I assume the same source that told Vu this has told one of you.  Please confirm/deny/discuss/masturbate.  3. The sweet corn here in Iowa is fabulous at present.  4. After having few visitors, aside from my parents, since Feb. 2003, we are receiving no fewer than 7 in the next month.  What the hell?  Perhaps everyone wants to see a battleground state up-close, or maybe they've heard tell of the butter cow.  5. While in SF, apparently, I got a stress fracture in my second metatarsal bone (the long bone that extends down your foot from your second toe), and it's killing me.  I can hardly walk, much less engage in aerobic activity or ass-kicking.  I suspect that some combination of poor foot construction (high arches), the high-heeled shoes I wore to the wedding, and my zipping through various airports with a heavy backpack created this situation.  So watch out, those of you who are similarly aged and whose warranties may be running out!  I hope everyone is doing well, particularly those of you who have recently been married or are soon getting married or are establishing a new life as FatWhiteGeisha.com in Japan.

       (Let me hear you say yeah) Yeah   Yesterday, I picked up Solomon Burke's most recent album  urlLink Don't Give Up on Me .  It's a good album, but missing are those great moments of backup vocals found on all his old recordings.  Not that there aren't back up vocals, its just that the don't quite achieve that transcendent, “us girls in the back here can’t just quietly say ooooh ooooh anymore.  Now that we have arrived at this third and final verse, we can’t  help but cry out, we’re so overcome by the pathos here.”  Al Green had great backup singers too, but to me they always sounded cool, sort of stoned; into it and everything, but a little incredulous and inexcitable.  A bit Minnesotan (they were, apparently, white, and thus conceivably Minnesotan, but of course I’m being metaphorical, like Chris Cornell on the same subject).     Whereas both Burke and Green have that “if you don’t love me my head is going to pop” quality, Burke chose for his back up symbolically sympathetic voices; sisters, perhaps, a sort of greek chorus that legitimizes his pain via public sympathy.  Green’s back up voices contrast then, as the mildly interested but also distracted (and perhaps disappointed and angry) headpopper herself.  Like, "whatever, Al.  I 've heard this  love and happiness   speech before.  It doesn't excuse you from forgetting to take out the trash.  But wait!  What's this?  I can't help myself.   I'm dancing.   The beat is too strong...   Must resist... Can't.  I am under your spell, Al."  Is it me, or did Otis not really use back up singers all that prominently?  There are all the duets with Carla Thomas, but I think it would be hard to count this without insulting her in some way.  It goes to show, that poor guy really was alone in the universe.  It isn't easy doing research on backup singers.  They are generally anonymous, or, if named, just that.  Stevie Nicks, however, is the notable exception, providing each of her singers with a bio on her  urlLink webpage  (click on "Singer pages').   urlLink Features journalism  is on the case.   urlLink A king and his court ; urlLink The madness of said king ; urlLink some inexplicable crazy shit  that came up on page five of a google search on "backup singer."

        The Best Band No One Ever Heard Of   By Impeccable Jones   I'm not as cool as I used to be.  I hang out with more writing dorks these days than music dorks, and the Iowa City Public Library is the closest thing we have to a hip record store around here  (no- I don't count  The Record Collector , because it sucks).  I don't play in a band anymore, and whether it is maturity or lifestyle, I no longer have the resources or the drive to claim hipness.  The library has deepened my appreciation for the likes of  Cheap Trick, Little Feat, Donovan  and  The Isley Brothers , but its not the place to find out when the next  Dillinger Four  album is coming out.  (They might not even be hip enough anymore to demonstrate the point, but if that's the case then I think I'm proving a larger point with my lameness.)  That said, I am proud of one my recent musical discoveries, The Nerves.   urlLink Not these guys , although they sound pretty cool, but  urlLink the Los Angeles   urlLink power trio  that only put out one  urlLink EP , in 1976.  Their most obvious claim to fame is that Blondie covered their tune "Hanging on the Telephone," and as hard as it is to argue with Blondie, the original is even better; an angular missing link between proto-punk and new wave, complete with the most desperate, earnest vocals ever not to suck.    The EP is out of print and notoriously scarce, but two of their four recorded songs can be heard on the Rhino compilation  urlLink D.I.Y.: Come Out and Play: American Power Pop I (1975-78)  which is also out of print, but more reasonably available if anyone is curious.  The two Nerves songs featured, "Hanging on the Telephone" and "When You Find Out" are, easily, the best on the whole compilation.  (Generally, the rhino D.I.Ys are fantastic, my personal favorite being  urlLink Teenage Kicks , a chronicle of pre-Costellonian pub rock.)  Thinking about the Nerves makes me wonder:  what other bands fall into the category of "could have been a contender"?  For the purposes of the discussion, let's try to limit it to bands that put out a great first album but were then never heard from again.  Those that were great and then went on to suck (or stick shotguns in their mouths) seem to be of an essentially different nature.  I'm talking about the bands who broke up so the bassist could go to seminary, or because the singer had twins, or, well, you know what I mean.

       Soap River   By IJ   I was walking across the Burlington Street bridge today in Iowa City and it looked like someone had dumped a couple tons of laundry detergent into the Iowa River.  The suds piled so high as to almost touch the lip of the dam and extended all the way down to the Benton Street bridge, about a halfmile down river.  What the fuck?  Does anyone know why this would be?    There's a scientific explanation for everything, I guess.  But that's so final.   I myself prefer pseudo-scientific explanations, because there's about a million explanations for everything that way, as opposed to science's measly one, and hey, they all might as well be correct.  One explanation is that with the recent thaw, the extra water is rushing over the dam at a greater velocity and more air is working its way in.  But still, this stuff was foamy and sticky, clearly something more than just water.  Perhaps a better pseudo-scientific explanation would have something do with salt in the ice and/or snow.  I was pretty confident about that last one until I wrote it down.  Any notions?

       Chabon is still a Fraud   By IJ   A number of you, via comment and email, have taken issue with my appraisal of Michael Chabon.  It seems, then, that further attention to this matter is merited.  My complaints with Chabon center largely around two elements to his style.  One, his writing prioritizes a seeming novelty over an actual substance.  There's a real dissonance between each image and all the images in aggregate.  There is no consistency I can see beyond the novelty of each.  There's nothing holistic about it; its like flipping through five hundred channels of television, stopping on each long enough to transcribe a line of dialogue, and then calling the whole thing an epic poem about the human condition.  Two, even if I am sure that stylistic novelty is a virtue in the greater context of substantive fiction, I don't think Chabon is all that novel.  I find it interesting (and troubling) that Chabon is identified as some sort of generational voice existing in diametric opposition to writers like "Updike and Orwell," the old guard, as it were.  I don't think that's good enough.  Chabon is feeding us the same shit in a new bowl.  There is still the realization of an expected effect, a flat and presumed mysticism to the mundane, and ultimately, an abject familiarity to all of it.  Now- we wouldn't read fiction if we didn't know that we enjoy reading fiction, and with that comes a reasonable expectation of what it will look like.  I'm not, exactly, calling for a revolution.  But there's something that makes me uncomfortable about the overestimation of novelty.  Perhaps it is a simple consequence of  business, but the ratio of products claiming to be novel : products that are genuinely novel is absurdly large.  It all smacks a little too much of being told how to think for one's self.   So I'm going to stick to my guns on this one.  Chabon still isn't good enough.  Not that he's bad, mind you, just not good enough.

       No, Really.  God Told Me.   By Impeccable Jones   As  urlLink Dirtdogs  points out, Johnny Damon is looking a lot like Christ lately.    What if ol' Jesus did come back, but decided he wanted to use his powers as a leadoff centerfielder for the Boston Red Sox?  Would this confirm my suspicion that Steinbrenner is the anti-christ?  That the 2004 WS trophy is, in fact, the final Rambaldi artifact necessary to melt the polar ice caps, compromise the salinity of the Atlantic, and make inevitable the worldwide chaos that would allow for Georgie's total domination?    While we're on the topic of righteousness, I have a question about those anti-gay marriage people:  they claim this is not a question of homophobia, but the sanctity of marriage.  Okay.  But why don't they picket outside Vegas wedding chapels?  Courthouses granting divorces?  Larry King's fourteenth wedding reception?  Why don't they lobby against the marriages without children?  There seems to be some serious cognitive dissonance going on here.  Then again, even if they were ideologically consistent, I'd still think they are assholes.      Oh, and MEL?  I didn't see your face at the last supper.  Why don't you stop trying to get yourself into Heaven, grow back that mullett and make more movies the dudes like for all the shooting and ladies like for the gratuitous inclusion of your naked ass.  I haven't seen  The Passion , but I do know that Gibson has defended the film as historically accurate despite the inclusion of demons and insistently nefarious jews.   Sure, Mel.  And William Wallace, (who you conflated with Robert the Bruce anyway) fathered  urlLink Edward III .

       A Master of Dungeons                          By IJ  I received a sackful of angry email for assuming that  urlLink this guy  is a dungeon master.  "How insensitive of you," you people wrote "to assume that just because he is overweight, bearded, and in a purple and teal striped shirt, that he is a dungeon master."  Well, it looks like the hunters have become the hunted here folks.  I didn't assume anything this fellow didn't advertise.   Not only is this dude a DM, he's been doing it since 1982, presiding over the  urlLink Company of the Righteous Fist .    Those are some badass motherfuckers.  Consider  urlLink Cethorlyn .  While his wisdom may be "dubious," his strength is "mythical," his dexterity the stuff of legend.  Sometimes I wish I had stuck with roleplaying games.  The moral clarity is so attractive.  That, and the fact that you can objectively evaluate yourself on a fixed scale.  Even Cethorlyn knows his own limitations.  Imagine living a life based on an honest and accurate understanding of your abilities.  We'd all find ways to be heroic, or at least, justify our own suicides.

       Reality, reality, let down your hair.  by A Better Mousetrap   from impeccable's last post, it seems i must say something about knowing cats from reality shows. mike royko, the ol chicago cynic/columnist once said that if you live in chicago for 5 years, you'll know someone who has been mugged, 10 years, you'll know someone who has been killed. (it's true, oddly, for me at least.) we can amend this cosmic law of averages now to reality shows: if you watch reality shows for 10 years, you'll know at least one moron who feels the need to take off his or her shirt, to "vent" to complete strangers, to "hook up" on account of all the free booze and instant celebrity (let's face it--people want the famous people, and reality shows fabricate more famous people) or to argue about "the needs of the house," all in front of 5 million drooling people with dorito-chapped fingertips.  so who is mine after these 10 years? ms.  urlLink Ellen Cho .  I don't have many funny stories about ellen, if you've seen road rules 10, shown June-November 2001, you know who she is, the flaky asian girl who got drunk every episode and never wanted to get her hands dirty. she's from libertyville, IL all right (actually Vernon Hills, a dopey stretch of quarter-acre lots next to our malls). i'm beginning to believe that anyone with no dirt under their cuticles is from libertyville.   ellen beat me for sophmore class treasurer. my platform was utilizing more of the class budget toward a social event, such as a sophmore valentine's day dance, where ellen advocated the allocation of funds to athletics and the creation of new clubs, such as LEAF (libertyville enviromental action foundation). i lost probably due to the fact that i was a weird geek and ellen was a cheerleader, but still, i'd rather dance than pick up litter. we lived in a suburb for christsakes.   as i watched ellen on mtv two years ago, realizing she was the first of no doubt many of my classmates that will become famous, i was forced to confront the nature of fame in my culture. first, her fame was not achieved by talent or hard work, so i wasn't proud or boastful of my fellow libertyvillian. (libertyvillian- wow, that word is spinning me around. it's like an evil patrick henry.) second, i saw that fame, even for the talented and hard-working, isn't something envious, because no matter what, you're on the same noterity level as someone like ellen or fat steve the obnoxious fiance. you get equal billing in the celeb media. if you're a woman, cloistered men still prowl around the internet for sites with you topless at the same relative rate as that of any other famous woman.   who wants to be famous anymore?

       Who ate all my guava butter?                                                                 by IJ      I went to High school with  urlLink this guy , star of some new Fox reality show involving a deceptive paradise, deceptive breasts, and deceptive contestants deceiving other deceptive contests.  I know what you're thinking, but the lack of blurry-naked, deceptive old dudes, at least, is refreshing.  Actually, I went to elementary school with him too.  When I go back to my parents' house, I can see from our living room across the yards into this guy's parents' kitchen.  Before you think I'm creepy for knowing/admitting this, consider that they, at least, can see me in my parents's living room from their kitchen.  Actually, I not only co-educated with this fella for about twelve years, but I still have a minor grudge against him.  The high school in our town was two stops down the D-Line, and from our neighborhood, the D-line was a solid ten minute walk.  This guy, however, had an old buick he inherited from his grandfather, and drove to school everyday.  He  gave my sister a ride every morning, but not me.  Because his buddy, who lived right across from the D-Line, didn't like riding the subway.     There are a few ways to look at this:    -  If I hadn't had to walk that twenty minutes everyday for those years, I wouldn't have listened on my walkman to all the albums of my youth :  London Calling, Repeater, Damaged, Doolittle , and a retrospectively embarrassing amount of ska.  If I hadn't walked to and from the T so much as a kid, there's nothing to say I wouldn't still be playing  urlLink Dungeons   urlLink &   urlLink Dragons  to this day.  ( urlLink This guy  calls DM)  -  Being snubbed by someone never feels so good as when you find out that someone eventually went on to exercise such poor judgment as to be on a reality television show.  They say that it is important to be liked by the right people.  If that's true, why couldn't it also be true that it is important to be disliked by the right people?  -  I now have the calf muscles of a God.

       Chabon is a Fraud         By IJ  Mousetrap and I were partying this weekend and he asked me if I have enjoyed my two years at Iowa.  Because I was drunk, I was able to say that what has been most useful about Iowa is the manner in which I have learned new ways to hold my writing to a higher standard.    The thinking, for me, is this: to be a better writer, really, is to be able to find more problems in your writing that are worth fixing and fixing them.  There is no treatment without the diagnosis.   Being at Iowa has, concurrent to battering my ego, improved my writing by making me like it less.  Over time, this has begun to lead, and one hopes will continue to lead, back not only to liking it, but to liking it on something closer to its actual merits which, one also hopes, are on the rise as well.  An immediate side effect is how I read books now.  Before I came to Iowa, it would have been fair to call me a  urlLink Michael Chabon  fan.  I read two of his novels the summer before I came to Iowa and I started a third last night, now that I am more than eighty percent done with my degree.  And I don't love it.  I am ambivalent to the neat metaphors, and I find myself tripping over the words that grow like weeds in each sentence, there only to make the voice more mannered when really, it is plenty mannered without them.  The long digressions might as well be covered in dew, the reader's reaction to them is so obviously engineered.  Now, I love writers like  urlLink Katherine Anne Porter  and  urlLink Jose Saramago , not because they are somehow more perfect than writers like Chabon (btw-The common criticism that Iowa produces "perfect" fiction is silly but based in a marginally related truth, a topic for another time).  I like them because they find ways to make their writing invisible, completely in service to the content.  The writers I like now don't walk a tightrope to make the reader ooh and ah like Chabon might think he is doing.  They walk the tightrope because on the otherside is something of interest, emotional and intellectual, like a baby tied up in dynamite, crying crying crying for its uncle Jose.  (Ferlighetti can go fuck himself for thinking of  urlLink this  stupid metaphor first).

      "Death to tyrants."             by  A Better Mousetrap   Sometimes when I think about the words John Wilkes Booth proclaimed upon shooting Abe Lincoln in the head, I get a little sad. Abe was no tyrant in the coiteries of that era. Most of the time I don't have to deal with divergent opinions; I've sort of prepared for this by surrounding myself with like-minded friends. We all like the movies that we're supposed to, for instance, "Lost in Translation." But occasionally one of these friends will surprise me. They will say something like "Hey man, I don't respect gay marriage. I don't respect anything irritating." So then, by no real conviction, I'm forced to confront this.

Anyway, to give you some sense of what he might be like, yesterday he sent me  urlLink this .

      I was watching TV tonight and came across "Dick Tracy."  Nevermind for a moment that with its set design this movie gives feature-length product placement to  urlLink the Avery Corporation.   I was much more taken by the resemblence between  urlLink William Forsythe 's  urlLink Flattop  and perhaps history's most obvious OCD crooner,  urlLink Billy Corgan .  I couldn't find a pic of Forsythe as Flattop, but I did find  urlLink this  , which is probably cooler anyway.  You think these two are secretly brothers?  There's no particular reason to think so, but its pretty clear that they would be embarrassed enough by each other to keep the secret.  I've always thought Forsythe was a pretty badass motherfucker, and that makes me think that if these two were brothers, perhaps it was Forsythe's vicious, childhood beatings of Billy that proved inspiration for all those sad sad songs.  But then again, the guy's an actor.  I don't know many actors, but it is hard to imagine any of those drama kids from high school beating up anyone.

      Day one.  This blog will  urlLink rock like babies cry  as soon as I can overcome this unbearable pressure to be interesting.   Lately, action movies are making me tear up a little bit, especially when unnamed henchmen eat it.  I can't explain this, really, and this is not the sort of sensitivity that seems useful.  I wondered for a minute if perhaps this was a christ-like love for all humanity (including henchmen, I guess) but I hate way too many people for that.   urlLink Way .   urlLink Too .  urlLink Many .  In fact, I even hate some  urlLink henchmen .   So much for that theory.  I wonder if it is empathy so much as the impossible desire for heroic glory.  Like the glory of Kurt Russell in  Big Trouble in Little China , or the dude himself in  Kindergarten Cop .  Or, if you want to get all educational, Stagger Lee.  These characters are, almost definitionally, neither absolutely moral or perfect, but  when they shoot somebody, you're glad they did.  You're glad because there is, despite its presence in their personality, no moral gray area to their actions.  To put it another way, I think I would rather be dropped by an orcish arrow at Helm's Deep than try to decide whether or not I should really feel bad for littering.  So maybe I cry at action movies the way some ladies cry at romantic comedies: a longing for a certain kind of life that is a certain impossibility.

       Two wrongs don’t make a left   Liberals starting  urlLink their own radio network  reminds me of  urlLink those people who go on Montel Williams  to confront  urlLink former bullies  with their new "hotness".  While my allegiances are clear, I can’t help but feel like the point has been missed.  You fight a bully on your terms, not theirs.  You don’t fight a bully by learning karate, getting new breasts, or replacing your comically oversized glasses with contact lenses.   I saw Janeane Garafalo last fall when I went to see Steve Earle and Billy Bragg on the  urlLink Tell Us The Truth Tour .  And even if she has become a punk rocker, she still isn’t that funny.  Sure, the crowd loved her, but she is to young, socially-conscious types what Billy Crystal is to celebrities:  because the political assumptions behind the jokes are agreeable, then the joke gets a laugh of concurrence more than of genuine amusement.  This makes the whole enterprise feel uncomfortably disingenuous; she shouldn’t be telling jokes that aren’t funny, she should be giving a speech.  But she shouldn’t be doing that either, because I’ve heard her give speeches and they weren't anything special.  It’s really sad, how people can become prisoner to their marginal talents.    I don’t think the left needs demagogues to match those on the right.  The success of the Republican party is a confluence of their strategies and ideologies.  We can’t beat them at their own game.  You don’t punch a bully.  Make out with his sister.  Booby trap his bicycle.  Go on to one day be his boss, allow him to get comfortable with you and think bygones are bygones.  Then, after awhile, accuse him of stealing from the till and fire him.  But don’t punch him, because even if you will feel momentarily empowered, it will turn out to be a throbbing sort of empowerment that swells and makes your ears ring for a little while.

       a rehashing of my salute to eggers  by scott  i think my point was that irony is so enmeshed into what it means to be human these days, i think there's no way one couldn't avoid its mechanisms. this is not sad; it's a  historical result. that said, what makes eggers king of the lit landscape is not his inclination toward irony, but his earnestness with respect to it. the idea that somebody being earnest to avoid being ironic yet being perceived as ironic is maddening, mostly because the meaning gets lost. eggers is a "great writer" not because of his writing, but because of his appropriateness to the culture of today. eggers is a genius, but not a rebel.   as for your dislike of irony pete, i say that you must sit until the world changes, until exposed nipples aren't news, until sports anchors shut the fuck up, until women stop cutting their hair like "Amelie," until people have identities that aren't pastiches of cheap jokes and "makeovers." you'd be sitting for awhile. you can build a meaningful aesthetic movement around irony, the proof's in the pudding; aesthetics only have meaning now in the context of non-aesthetics, in the incongruity. that's a movement. it's part dada, part seinfeld. as is the case for anything with meaning, it's beautiful and people are left nonplussed.   jedidiah purdy, age 24 in 1999, wrote about irony and hope in his book "for common things." like most discussions of irony it makes your head hurt and leaves you wondering whether or not we as humans actually can have meaning, or if meaning itself is a deluded concept we created because we don't trust ourselves or our creations. if you lock a 24 year old educated boy in a room with a computer, he will awe himself silly. this is our movement.

They are rooting for a team that's blessed, if they'd only see it — a team better than any other at generating the sort of tales the ancients used to tell one another around flickering fires — not easy tales of annual triumph but long, episodic, sustaining stories of struggle, promise and promise subverted, frailty, cowardice, terrible surprise, failure, and loss; in short, tales of each of us and of all of us.

      before i get back to texas by scott  before i get back to texas i should thank pete for the great article on eggers, dfw, irony, and pabst. as i read this, i worried that the symptoms described of a "mcsweenyite" have me in their embrace. i say worried because of the fear that pops; namely not appearing individualistic. but then i took some deep breaths and realized that dave eggers, a man like myself furnished and homogenized in the affluent north chicago suburbs, is a great writer. the fact that he shouldn't be a great writer due to his "adolescent revving" and other obvious demonstrations of what has come to typify irony is all part of the seachange.   the problem of being hip is always staying ahead of the game. the kids drinking pabst can create an anti-marketing idea, but the truth concerning pabst is that it's only chosen to be drunk as the demographic beer of choice because the stuff is cheap. even that is wicked ironic, look at the numbers.   what's funny about our literary world today, with eggers at the captain's wheel, is that it is a perfect fit. that irony should even come up in discussion is redundant. do you watch jay leno? jay leno does the traditional monologue of jokes to start his show. he says the name "jennifer lopez." the joke, everyone knows, will be about J Lo's big ass. why do we all know that? that we all do is something of great awe.   a friend of mine once said, "anyone with a brain has to hate society." our first reaction to anything has become scorn. so it follows that i hate to be ironic; i would like to scorn the hipness of this literature that uses every trick imaginable to always stay ahead of the game. but some of today's best writers are in eggers' bag. this is not a rebellion, it's a result. and irony has ceased to be irony. irony is now awe: the inevitable response of a sensitive mind to the world.

      Irony is crack for the well-educated.  urlLink  And I blame Eggers.   Maybe irony was once  urlLink rebellious  and  urlLink meaningful , but now it is such a recognizable fact of the cultural landscape that it has become an opiate of sorts.  Its rebelliousness has become illusory and, worse, it has become an act of complacency.  Because if part of the point is that "getting" the joke sets the "getter" apart, what happens when everyone gets the joke?  People only seem to be individualistic.  And apparently, that's good enough for a lot of us.  (And yes, this whole development is ironic and it might even be ironic that it is ironic, but, you know, fuck off).  I realize how difficult it is to make such points and not sound like a curmudgeon (or an elitist).  What concerns me more than people laughing at self-indulgent jokes that aren't funny is that amusement takes the place of meaning; the smirk replaces the smile and the tear; that the stakes are so low that it is impossible to miss the mark.  The stakes and effects are clear in literature, but maybe the problem is more than an aesthetic one; maybe this has cultural and political ramifications with even higher stakes.

       Too Many White Guys Up in Here   Boston sports Blowhard Bob Ryan is being accused of " urlLink reverse   urlLink racism " for saying that Vanderbilt's team had "too many white guys" to advance past Western Michigan in all this March Hullabaloo.   Certainly, it was a stupid comment, but just as stupid is the controversy that has arisen in response to Ryan.  Maybe I've been listening to  urlLink Jim   urlLink  McPherson  too much with his talk of "moral dandyism," but it seems that people tend to be outraged by the same statements on TV that, when stated at, say, Thanksgiving dinner, would only get a collective eye roll.  These statements are equally inappropriate and stupid regardless of their context; what troubles me is this socially obliged outrage that people affect for the sake of the water cooler or the smoking lounge, the "some of my best friends are Afghani," the "lest you think I'm a racist myself, bask in the glory of my indignation," variety of armchair commentary that we are all familiar with.  Because part and parcel to this annoying conflation of "outrage" and "social action" is a more troubling phenomenon: people are more worried about being considered a racist than they are about being one.  Some are calling for Ryan to resign over his comments.  This seems beside the point.  If people got half as upset about institutionalized racism as they did about the stupid, minor, ultimately inconsequential expressions of it that dot the media landscape, we'd live in a different country.    Consider the presidency of George W. Bush; the very appeal of "compassionate conservatism," is it's adoption of liberal rhetoric as disguise for your father's (his father's) Republicanism.  Because the education program is called "No Child Left Behind," it is less of a concern when children, en masse, are left behind.  Because the proposed changes to immigration policy are framed in terms of the interest of immigrants themselves, it is not a concern when the real benefits go, fully and clearly, to corporate employers looking to exploit labor.  Because it is called the Patriot Act, it can suspend constitutional rights.  Because Bush looks and sounds like a mook, he can't possibly be wily enough to dupe us as he has.

       deep in the heart , part one  by Scott   a woman on the airplane to texas asked me if i had lost my baseball cap. i said i don't wear one and she politely replied, "you look like you do."   i didn’t know, and still don't know, if the all the peculiarities this weekend in austin were strictly texan, or if they were just appropriate for the atmosphere of a festival. i could have, in some sense, ate only barbeque ribs and zoned out for 4 days at say, the Sundance festival. nevertheless I was in awe constantly.   I've heard a man play a bassline across an old Ford gas tank. I've heard three 'i know ryan adams here's how ok back in raleigh' stories by the second night. i've watched as a guitar player stepped onto a 24 inch bass drum near the end of a song, only to realize he still must count out rhythm and move his fingers appropriately and at that instant slip, have his hands doubleback to catch him, leaving his guitar neck free to swing up and knock him unconscious. whack boom, him hitting the floor, although for a moment, like four seconds, the drummer kept playing, alone, finishing the measure over the stunned silence and awe, awe like an ape from between the bars of his cage grabbing your jacket sleeve at the zoo and not letting go, instead screaming at you for four seconds. i was winded. what was unsatisfying for emotional folks like me was that then the girl playing bass started crying. To others this was the shit. Oh the heckles!   it was good to be drunk, though. My ears started to ring due to the humidity and decibel levels; this too began to delight me after an extended period of time.   i've had an ATM on fourth avenue ask me for $3.75 to give me its twenties. when i yelped in disbelief, an old sage wearing a carmelo anthony jersey stopped trotting by to remark, "people who give spare change to homeless people shouldn't have to be charged a fee for their twenties." i agreed, bought him a slice of pizza, and asked him, since I was going, to accompany me to the texas capitol building.

      Today  urlLink The Presurfer  links to  urlLink Cosplay.com , an internet community of people who dress up as their favorite anime characters.  I'm not an expert on Anime, but what exposure I have had to the artform seems to indicate a peculiar fascination with white people; despite being quintessentially Japanese, there is a notable lack of recognizably Japanese characters.  Whatever this means, and I realize it could mean a lot of different things, there is an odd effect to seeing white people dressed as japanese versions of white people.  This exaggeration of the features, along with the satiny, revealing costumes themselves, the fetishistic qualities of so much effort going into so marginal (or at least uncommon) an interest, it makes the whole thing feel vaguely pornographic.    It doesn't help that the featured girls are sisters (21 and 18, respectively), that they hold each other in intimate poses, or that there is an innocence to this whole endeavor that seems obliviously virginal.  Am I way off here?  Know more about this than I do?  Please share.

       Pot of Gold   So why do the Irish get their own holiday?  Not that I begrudge them St. Patrick's day; the idea of a day when every mook in America thinks he can mimic and caricature my heritage doesn't quite appeal to me.  But it is interesting to imagine the equivalents for other ethnic groups: Italian, Mexican, Black, Jewish, Pakistani, etc.  And no,Cinqo de Mayo doesn't count.  Until they're celebrating it in every backwater, regardless of that backwater's ethnic makeup, it isn't fairly comparable.  Of course, that whole excuse to get shitfaced aspect of St. Patty's probably helps with its popularity.  Whenever I think of Saint Patrick's Day, I think of this guy I went to high school with.  Every year after February vacation, he would come to school with a six pack of green frosted cupcakes complete with plastic clovers, the first day they were available from Star Market.  He'd make a big show about how these were his favorite cupcakes and they were only available for a few weeks every year and if any of us motherfuckers tried to eat one he would kill us.  (There was reason to believe him in this: he once mistakenly threatened a friend of mine with a long knife for something he didn't do, something related to this guy's drug trade, and when he later realized that he was threatening the wrong guy he came back to apologize).    So anyway, he'd carry these cupcakes out to the bleachers on the farside of the football field and eat them by himself.  I don't know why these cupcakes were so special, and I don't know why, if they were so special, he would bring them to school with him.  But everytime, some poor fool would follow him, trudge across the field, try to finagle one, and get punched.   St. Patrick's Day also makes me think of the best Disney movie ever:   urlLink Darby O'Gill and the Little People , based on the 1903  urlLink storybook .  At an early age, this movie taught me an important lesson: those  urlLink leprechauns  are  urlLink sneaky bastards , and if I ever see one, I should spare myself the trouble and look the other way.

       the stars at night  by Scott i'll be leaving for austin texas and its south by southwest  urlLink festival  early thursday morning, so i wanted to report that should i be able to make internet contact, i will post from there. there's no doubt there will be hijinks from the new south to report. i don't know the entymology of the word hijinks. my only plan for shows is to see several bloodshot records acts, since i will be accompanying their director of promotions, my friend rebecca. also, i will be attending the suicide girls burlesque show. so pray for me. while you're praying, slip in a good word for my pal rodney, who sells the Streetwise newspaper. he still doesn't believe in god, but today informed me that he doesn't believe in self-fulfilling prophecy either, so, in his opinion, "that leaves little else."

       The Beautiful Albino  by Scott  the other day i met a beautiful albino girl here at the library and ended up speaking to her, mostly about albinism and the band counting crows. her eyes were not red, so i asked her about that first. apparently, everything we non-albinos know about albinos is shrouded in confusion and fear, mostly a result, in my opinion, from that awful movie "Powder." many albinos have light eyes, light brown, blue (like hers), certainly not red. the beautiful albino--let's call her Jessie--claimed that the "myth" of red eyes comes from medieval doctors believing that albinos were devils. albinos lack melanin in their skin, hair, eyes, but most have little amounts in some of these areas. the beautiful albino had long straight white hair and skin like a pressed fingernail. she wore cute glasses and looked a bit like what would happen if you sucked all the pigment out from lisa loeb.  albinos, jessie explained, all have problems with their vision because of the reduced amount of pigment in their irises, light is not refracted correctly and stray light that enters causes damage. jessie herself had a problem known as strabismus, where one of her eyes wandered out to the side a bit, which affected her depth perception. we spoke a little about the book "blindness" for a while, where everybody suddenly goes blind and only see whiteness. jessie said that blindness would always be darkness, whiteness implied a light refracting off the iris. perhaps, she joked, it was "an albino epidemic." i honestly couldn't tell jessie was cross-eyed, but things can be deceiving in the presence of a beautiful albino.   an example: while we were talking outside the library, jessie gestured with her hand at the dominicks supermarket, and suddenly stammered, "sorry." i realized then that she had pointed at the store with her middle finger, because on her right hand her index finger was only like an inch long. "whoa," i said, not knowing what else to say, and not having noticed until now. jessie's finger is the result of more inept genes, but not from being an albino. she believes that her parents are not at fault for anything that has happened to her. everyone i know blames their parents for everything, from their emotional detachment to their inability to wash their dishes, so it was a refreshing point of view, especially from somebody with so much damage done to her outside her capacity of control. so making fun of albinos might also be something a 14 year old would do, but in the spirit of the blog i wanted to report i met a nice, well-adjusted, beautiful one.   which led to our discussion of counting crows. she brought up that she liked the band, so i dropped my theory on them to her: 90s rock was relatively weak in terms of staying power, and what grunge did was take rock kids into subdivided, but still very similar, camps. i don't believe there was anything that good about grunge, it was just heavy metal with different clothes. but what the dividing of "alternative" rock did was place bands like REM and counting crows into a more "adult" category, a more, i don't know, VH1 brand, because grunge was for the slackers and the burnouts, the "young." however, the first counting crows album served to give whiny kids and adults everywhere a voice. so many people responded to that album, and it's not any good, as their whole ouvre can attest. but something about the timing of that first album: out just after nirvana's "nevermind," the developing rift between "alternative" and regular rock, the third-wave ska nonsense, the large number of kids not seeing their rebellion in plaid shirts and stage dives.   instead, and i think this was a subconscious thing going on here, counting crows had ushered in the sensitive-cowering-as-rock era, most notably the emo explosion. i take nothing away from Rites of Spring or Fugazi, but they didn't expect anything like emo to take off like it has either. the reason was counting crows. all of the songs on "august and everything after" build moods, bad moods. even the single "mr. jones" made everybody turn inward, and that was a happy uptempo tune. counting crows singer adam duritz was a meaty slacker, however he whined about loss and the mood of loss and all ages subconsciously was in tune with these chaotic ramblings about birds and rain. it may have had something to do with the fact that duritz was with Jennifer Aniston at the time. think about it: she moves from that guy to brad pitt. she had to have known something.   duritz himself was a contradiction of images, a grungy-looking singer with sweet melodies and plainitive musings. i remember the set for the "mr. jones" video, it was a beatup old apartment. it wasn't a high school gymnasium, but it was grunge for sure. somebody at viacom really was set with this whole split of "modern" rock into something more tangible for the age markets.   perhaps the crows were the springsteen of our time. for that one album they established that a mood was crafted not just on loss, but on pity. duritz clearly was not comfortable in his own skin, and amazingly everybody got it. all music is emotional to be sure, but this rock had an element of morose pity, a subconscious empathy. it wasn't just a dude feeling sorry for himself, whining away. it was the idea that all of us feel sorry for who everybody is. it was saturated with the beginnings of an ironic worldview.   as i said this to the beautiful albino, she echoed this sentiment: "it seems like the crows wanted us to cry, then wanted us not to believe that we were doing it."

       A Cruel Continuance   Last night I watched a new episode of  The Simpsons  for the first time in a couple years.  I am sorry to say that the same downward trend that made me stop watching that show is still in effect  (whatever  urlLink this guy  says now).    But I don't think the show sucks for the same reasons some more vocal television critics might.  Despite all the  urlLink jerk-ass Homer   theories  urlLink out there , Homer was always stupid.  The difference, then, is that in the earlier seasons, he was still human.  He was not guinea pig to a cheap and lazy postmodern slapstick.  He got himself in situations that, even if they were mundane, evoked recognizably human emotions  (Of course, I'm not suggesting that that show was legitimate drama, but that it was based in a loose realism).   The show’s symbiosis of sweetness and humor is what makes the golden years golden.   If the first season of  the Simpsons  tries to be sweet, but isn’t quite funny, the later seasons don’t even try to be sweet but aren’t funny either.  Another way to put it is that the writers no longer feel obliged to any sort of consistency.  They rely on the fact that they are a cartoon and that the jokes are limited only by what the artist’s can draw.  The result isn’t even Dadaist, it’s just bad prop comedy.  The jokes don’t add up to anything the way they used to, but each exists in its own vacuum of a desperate plea for laughs.  Even when it is occasionally funny, that’s all it is.  Satire is supposed to be more than that.  Homer, and the other characters for that matter, are only consistent across several episodes insofar as they have previously gotten laughs for being x or y, reducing each to the lowest common denominator of whatever they ever have been. The result is a caricature of a cartoon, if that’s possible, and it fucking sucks.

        Sorry I didn't post yesterday.  I had an ER visit on Wednesday night that turned out to be not such a big deal, but I was there until 3 AM.  Those fuckers really like to scare you; I thought I was in dire straits until I talked to my own doctor yesterday and cleared things up.   It looks like I'm okay, but please understand that considering one's own mortality is not great inspiration for a blog post, at least not at the time.          So: I'm not going to die anytime soon.  Barring runaway buses, random acts of violence, vendettas, bounties or grudges I am unaware of; stray toasters over prone bathtubs; rabid dogs, hungry zoo animals; skiing accidents; car accidents; wildly irresponsibly drug use; landing on the wrong side of a kitchen knife; a freak blow to the temple; et cetera.  Barring all these things and more I cannot name, I will not be dying any time soon.  I'll post something less personal a little later.

            A Kind of Guerilla Warfare   In 1981, Lynne Cheney, second lady of the Union, published  Sisters , a "novel of the American Frontier that breaks bold, new ground," "bold new ground" being code for  "lesbian romance."  (Reportedly, of course.  I haven't read it myself.)  See the cover  urlLink here .  (Via  urlLink Maud Newton  )   I think this pretty much speaks for itself.  I'm not generally a fan of irony, but you've got to savor it on the rare occasion that it isn't cheap.  If conservative moralists didn't set inhuman and judgmental standards of behavior, this sort of thing wouldn't be so embarrassing for them.

       Brown Eggs are Local Eggs and Local Eggs...   The results of the banking poll seem to indicate that you people prefer a local asshole to an international one.  I guess I do too, because a less sucessful asshole is, perhaps, less of an asshole.  Unless, that is, he is desperately trying to move up in the asshole hierarchy, in which case he might be worst asshole possible.    There's something oddly provincial about the assumption that a local bank is preferable to a larger one, even if it is definitively "just as greedy."  It seems people are willing to pay for the right to say they bank locally, because even a great mug can't make up for all the free shit those conglomerate bastards pile on you.  Free checks, free card, no monthly this and that, etc.; one saves enough money to buy a case of novelty mugs.    Of course, the appearance is that local banks can't afford to give these perks out like candy, but I wonder if, to whatever degree, the spartan account package provides a more valuable commodity of customer self-satisfaction, meaning, that even if they could give out the same amount of free shit, they have a stake in not doing so, in allowing their customers to feel like their banking decisions are moral decisions.  That's pure speculation, of course, but it strikes me that while it would be easy to frame this discussion in terms of David and Goliath, we cannot forget that we are talking about institutions that have much more in common than they do not, including but not limited to a hardline profit motive, willingness to screw you over, and, of course, an assholed nature.  I don't mean to make them sound evil, either; I just mean to say that morality is irrelevent to this discussion.  The solution?  Well, I've been assured that my gold doubloons are in the mail.  A note to my neighbors: if you see a canvas, uncle-scrooge "$$$" sack on my front door, please do me the favor of bringing it around to the backdoor.

      Thanks, Pete, for talking about movies.  Now you got me started.  I went to see "Hidalgo" this weekend, a new Taboule-Western starring Viggo Mortensengensenden.  The script is unbelievably hack: a metis Lakota cowboy/horse racer, racked with guilt over delivering the orders for the massacre at Wounded Knee, sets out to win a horse race across the Arabian desert, to spread his own unique brand of rugged individualism to the swarthy Bedouin sheiks and, inadvertantly, to find his true self.    Unfortunately, this movie is entirely too enjoyable for its own good.  Lawrence of Arabia meets Dances With Wolves meets Black Beauty.   The horse, a piebald Mustang, is an obvious stand-in for its mixed rider (there is much talk about the purity of breeds). By the last reel, the horse has also become an equine surrogate for the plight of Native Americans.  (Yes, the constricting saddle must be removed for the beast to truly excel.)   The movie is filled with well-timed whinnies and nickers, and the horse is a sarcastic sidekick, often looking over its shoulder and fluttering its lips as a comment on the action.  And yet in spite, or perhaps because of its corny aesthetic, it is a Cinemascope delight: each shot has Speilbergian grace and several action sequences are like the most delicious moments of Golden Age matinee serial.  And then snickering at the script is also part of the fun.  When our hero pulls a fellow (Arab) rider from quicksand, the rescued man is upset with him for meddling with Allah's plan.  "It was God's will," he explains to the American.  The Indian-Cowboy squints, and says, "But what of your will?"  A light goes on the Muslim's eyes, as he is fascinated by the heretical, but liberating idea.    That pretty much sums up the steaming piles of twisted logic that are scattered in the path of "Hidalgo"; it at once rejects Western expansionism in the Great Plains, yet simultaneously embraces cultural imperialism in the Arabian desert (although English colonialists are gleefully vilified).  Indians are noble members of a "dying kind" and need to run free, yet the tribal Bedouins are close-minded chauvinists in desperate need of modernity.  The horse, an introduced species, is somehow the perfect vehical for the tenor of native peoples.  "Hidalgo" is a greasy-popcorn treat for a rainy Saturday.  Just don't think about it too much.

       the gospel according to rodney  by Scott  i finished up "blindness" by jose saramago yesterday. how can a book rock that hard for 318 pages then die unceremoniously in the last 8 with such an inappropriate ending? i was hoping for more violence, or more suffering, like the rains that were happening after they got out of the asylum continuing, and the rains would last for 40 days and all the blind would drown, and they would scream and water would fill their lungs and there would be proverbs about swallowing water and then they would vomit water, except our lucky 7 heroes and their dog (which, in a risky and bizzare translation choice, was called the "dog of tears" instead of the "tear dog," which if you know anything about spanish makes more sense, plus it doesn't put a confusing image of a  urlLink large  salty aqua-dog in your head), and they would float on a raft of excrement, and the only thing left would be the birds, who would swoop down and peck away at the raft, and that's how we would leave our surviving heroes....   seriously. what's with  urlLink redemption  these days? why must all that suffer have it? where's the reality in suffering i ask. can't we as a culture accept suffering for what it is? i.e., not a test, not a martyr-making trial, simply just a shit time to sit there and take whatever, for reasons known or unknown, that you got coming?   is all suffering redemptive? i don't think so. i look to the scum of chicago when i think about suffering. today i saw rodney, my favorite crazed overweight (?) bum who sells copies of Streetwise newspaper near my library. rodney, like Job, has boils on his face, has lost his family (only Yahweh didn't take rodney's), and arthritis in "every joint," causing him to lean up against a trashcan and not move for up to ten hours. should he have to move, like say when i want to buy a Streetwise from him that day, he whines all through the transaction. and what does rodney get for his suffering? a busted nose that some creep gave him after he solicited his wares a little to much? is this a form of redemption? "what," rodney asks, "must i do?"   i bring Job up to rodney today, telling him heed his advice and to just "hang in there." you know what rodney said? in between his arthritic wincing, he reached up into his mouth and extracted a dirty tooth from his mouth. "fuck hanging in there," rodney said.

       Rogues, Rebels, Rubber Stamps   WBEZ's Eight Forty Eight provides the " urlLink essential book list for anyone who wants to understand Chicago ," (Via  urlLink Bookslut ).  I've only read a few of these, but I know a lot of my readers live in Chicago and assumed it would be of interest to them.  It makes me wonder: what does "place" mean, anyway?  How is it that we are we able to agree that Chicago is culturally peculiar and distinct from other cities of comparable size?  It seems that, despite the identifiable "feel" of any city, the similiarities between cities would outnumber the differences. (Meaning that Chicago is more like New York than it is like Libertyville or Kankakee). And what about the implications of "place" for fiction writing?  How does a writer successfully characterize a place without reducing it to cliches and overstated exoticisms?  Without making a caricature of it?

       I cancelled my cable at the wrong time   It looks like  urlLink Iron Chef is going American  (Via  urlLink Chicha ).  I think this is horrible.  The core of the show (competitive cooking) is not the heart of the show and the heart of the show ( urlLink a fantastically gay matador with an unlimited fortune and a penchant for zestily eating bell peppers  ) is quintessentially Japanese.  The idea of poor Chairman Kaga going so far out of his element as to host dinner for Paige Davis and Dennis Franz makes me sad.  According to the article, the plan is to find a new chairman.  But who could be more than a shadowy second to Kaga?  (Maybe,  urlLink this guy , but even he's a longshot.)  If I didn't have so much faith in Kaga to have duped some stupid American into a grossly unbalanced agreement for the rights to "Iron Chef," I would say this smacks of a fucked up post-modern imperialism.  ( Edit:   I've been shooting from the hip with my posts lately, so I'm going back to clean up the writing here and there).

       Couches, Continued (Another Movie Discussion)   The gentle but total self-loathing that comes with being 12 is a delicate thing; the sucking of air through the teeth in an automatic self-deprecation, the hope that looks really don’t matter, as manifested with chronic bedhead and bare, metal frames for one’s glasses and the dwindling hope that life will not always be what is coupled with an innocent enthusiasm that it shouldn’t.  What made me love  Spellbound  so much is how the kids competing in the National Spelling Bee are subject to all this self-consciousness and yet, at the same, smartly defiant enough to compete in a National Dork Fest.  These are the future students of Carleton and Colgate; MIT and Berkeley.  One doesn’t worry about these kids: their futures are secure and at least, more secure than my own.  The definitions they now live by will dissolve, or in some ways, reverse.  The viewer’s knowledge of this is what makes the movie so poignant.  David Edelstein has called  Spellbound  the best film of 2003, and it’s hard to think of one that is better.  One movie that sure isn't better is  American Wedding .  While there is always something to be said for lively profanity, this movie ultimately parodies what I would expect is its most loyal demographic: the stupid white male between the ages of 15 and 22, who thinks of getting laid as life’s central quest, perpetuates homophobia while claiming to do the opposite, and, in the interest of both aims, reads Maxim.  It’s an odd tactic, making fun of one’s hardest core fans, and one tries to imagine the target viewer; an idiot who thinks he can laugh at himself, but effectively only does so in an elaborate self-permission to be an asshole to everyone else (whether or not they “get the joke.”)  But despite the gambit, this movie is just boring.  And I don’t mean to sound like I’m too good for teenage-sex-comedy; I was really hoping it would be redeemed by the same low-humor that made the original American Pie reliable in its own way.  But if you do ever watch this movie, check out the DVD interviews with writer Adam Herz; someone has been telling this guy he’s a genius, and the schadenfreude over his complete lack of self-awareness is fun.

       Glory Days, Glory Couches   This weekend my girlfriend was out of town and my college roommate came to visit.  This pairing of events made for a brief revisiting of my bachelor days; lazy, smoky, and replete with Chinese food and Pepperidge Farm goldfish.  We watched a lot of DVDs, in fact, that’s about all we did, and in an attempt to somehow justify this sloth, I will use the weekend as fodder for this week's posts.    One of the movies we watched this weekend was  Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines   and it made me wonder: Has there ever been a time-travel movie that actually makes sense?  It seems that so many of these movies, like T3, simultaneously ask the viewer to suspend disbelief and then also be genuinely awed by some pseudo-scientific plot twist in the third act.  Then there are all the questions of free will that arise, and while T3 pays lip service to such questions, it does no better than either of its stupid, stupid, predecessors.  It has always seemed to me that if time travel is ever actually possible then it would, by its own use, always be possible, making 50 BC and 2050 AD   spatially   proximate; time-space would be reduced to space alone.  Actions would be constantly revisable and, it seems, nothing would mean anything.   Does that make sense?  Maybe not, but it makes more sense than T3.      I watched another stupid movie this weekend,  Die Hard 2: Die Harder   and realized that what had, in 1990 seemed to me an arcane and sophisticated complexity, is really unnecessary complication and convolution.  A lot of action movies, both of these included, fall prey to this tendency.  When I was in high school, I honestly thought I was stupid because I couldn't really follow the plot of  Mission: Impossible  but upon later viewings in more intellectually confident times, I realized that movie makes no goddamn sense.  This begs the question: why make a movie that doesn't make sense?  Or that is unnecessarily complicated?    Of  course I don't know, but it is a common enough practice in a really expensive medium, so I think it is fair to assume that it is intentional; that there is a hope that the reader will appreciate the mention of interesting and/or complex ideas more readily than they will actually accept the invitation to think on those ideas.  (It's worth noting, perhaps that I have been accused, at many points in my life, of overthinking.  This seems an impossible action to me, but maybe that it seems that way to me is only proof that I am, in fact, guilty of the charge.  Every semester,  I receive at least one student evaluation complaining that I am "too philosophical.")  Commercials also rely on this cognitive gap, though with different pretenses.  There was a recent truck commercial in which a gray haired but relatively young man in a twill shirt (demographic flags, I suppose) drove his gas-guzzling, gargantuan pickup by a construction site.  Mistaking his truck for one working on the site, the backhoe dumps a load of dirt in his truckbed.  The intended subtext, I think is "this truck is so good at being a truck that not only will it serve any need for it you might have, if you are using it to enact an authenticity/class guilt fantasy, not even a costruction worker will be able to recognize your fraudulence."  But, really.  That's supposed to trump the fact that this guy is now burdened with a bedful of dirt?  That sounds like a real hassle to me.  Could a backhoe mistakenly filling your vehicle with dirt ever be a good thing?  Why then would I want to buy a truck that advertises the possibility?    This is the sort of thinking that, if I do it too much, makes me really paranoid.  Is mass-media training us not to think?  To find a knee-jerk pleasure in the misfortune of fictional others so powerful that it trumps logic, sympathy and ultimately our own self-interest?   Are we becoming cynical by default?  It used to be that cynicism was the result of disappointment and frustration.  But have the disappointment and frustration simply become assumed?  Fuck.  Where's the  urlLink tin foil ?       (Note: I make no claim of understanding quantum physics.  So if you're pretty sure I've gotten something wrong in the time-travel discussion, set me straight.)

       Rick Moody is the only alter-ego here   Some of you have been asking me, and I'm pretty sure "Rick Moody" the blog commentator is not Rick Moody the author.  That is, unless he happens to share an IP address with someone else who has been leaving comments with a much less notable name; a name that is a little more familiar around here in the comment threads.      At the time of this post, 50% of poll respondents believe that one, the other, or both of Scott and I do not exist.  There's an irony in all this.  I think I am going to start taking the weekends off from IJ.  But if I have the time and inclination to post, I will.  Other posters are welcome to post over the weekend as they like.

      In Defense of Porn and Fantasy by Scott  i'd like to thank "kate" for giving the porn article to pete. pete previously told me this blog was going to be free of all things pornographic, so i'm glad an intelligent lady was able to force him into the realm of the living and out of the dungeons of video games, hit points, vampires, and other high-fantasy riffraff.    now onto the subject of another fantasy, one less laden with heal potions and full moons. i'm speaking of the soft-core publishing world. the mags Maxim and Stuff now have an unprecented popularity (i say unprecented, because, well man, there's no nudity, only coy posturing, lots of oil and  airbrushing, and PLENTY of marketing). i believe these mags have done more to damage male libido than porn.   wolf is right when she ascertains that for men today "naked just isn't enough" and the accessibility of porn makes women question their own sexual value. if i was a woman, it would suck. but wolf is dead wrong on several points, probably due to the fact that she didn't get enough smart guys to talk to her about the notion of fantasy. she had a dipshit college boy from Northwestern with a quote at the end, but i (and when i say i, i mean my gender) am disappointed to be represented by this lug, who probably just said what he did in hopes of getting laid. it just reinforced her point, which is why i guess she put it in.     Ms. Wolf claims: "For most of human history, erotic images have been reflections of, or celebrations of, or substitutes for, real naked women. For the first time in human history, the images’ power and allure have supplanted that of real naked women. Today, real naked women are just bad porn."   back up. 'substitutes for?' how naive is this woman? think about it; men do not look at porn because they imagine real women being depicted, they look at it for the same reason pete plays Halo: fantasy is exciting, new, fresh, and a hard-wired need for variety. within the constructs of this awfully dishonest culture we live in, monogamy is the accepted norm, but biologically, it's anything but natural. men look at porn for an escape from the real-world mutally-respecting relationship. women want monogamy and men should respect that within a relationship, however to view porn as a sort of sexual competition is a female-centered viewpoint, and does not take into consideration the atavistic needs of the man.   i don't mean to piss off the ladies, but the biggest problem with porn today is that it is kept hidden and down as "base" and "shameful" when in fact 99 percent of the men i know have looked at it, probably more times a week than i want to say. none of these men try to search for partners that look like the glossy pages, or deny a good woman because she's not up to snuff with the content of their nudie mags. that's preposterous. guys who would do that are just assholes who probably jerk off way too much for their own good. just because some twenty-something ladies get boob jobs and brazilian waxes, i don't think they're trying to compete with porn (although there is something going on in these women's heads i can't explain). porn is something else, it's not vying for your man's affections.   so when wolf says the images have "supplanted" real naked women, i say no no ms. writer. what's going on is the fantasy is now being supplanted by the marketing. they're trying to sell me too much with it.   back to maxim. if the male libido is in decline i believe it's because of these horrible soft-core mags. it's presented as a style-couture mag, one ostensibly with the idea that you buy the junk and the fashions advertised, you'll be able to date a woman like this famous one here we're teasing you with. it's marketing. and it's fucking annoying. it's messing with the fantasy of it all. the fantasy being, this isn't reality. this isn't a woman i'd walk down the street with and listen to her talk about why tears for fears is so awesome, or why mies van der rohe buildings are so ugly. this woman in maxim is there to sate the fantastical male idea of line and form. it's not real, i'm not harboring notions of going out and trying to fuck it.   "it" isn't even a woman when it comes down to it, because she's been done up and photoshopped and pulled and prodded and greased into this fantasy. and as a fantasy, the men can act out this need for long-legged, fake-breasted variety without their real partners having to go out and reshape their "sexual value," as ms. wolf puts it. it's not about sexually competing for a man, or for his fantasy. men are always going to fantasize. porn and soft-core and the internet have made women more aware of male fantasies, but that doesn't mean that they should try to be something they're not.   men should respect women and their lives well and value monogamy. but let's face it, nature v. nurture has got other plans. as a man i understand ms. wolf's worries about today's women not "measuring up" to porn. but fucking A, ms. wolf, give us guys more credit. just because we think about this smut, and see a lot of it, sometimes on a daily basis, doesn't mean we think there's no mystery to sex. if men didn't have access to the fantasy, they might try to act it out on their partner, and some women might find us disgusting, wrong, correctly disrespectful. it's all about keeping both sides mutually respected if you ask me. just don't try to make me buy a fucking car stereo with the fantasy please.

       Be Careful What You Know   I received the following email this morning from my friend Anna:   Hey Pete, I'm wrapping up to hand in the novella next week, and wanted to quiz  you on a little D and D trivia.  I'm looking to figure out what a bad guy might  be called -- specifically a guy who looks to take over territory or kingdoms  or whatever it is you do in that game?  Does this make sense?  NOt a specific  name, just the role: are they called kings/tyrants/assholes???  any help would be greatly appreciated.     What is more notable here: 1)  That a  girl     is asking me about Dungeons and Dragons (If this had happened twelve years ago, when I was actually playing the game, I'd be in love.) Or 2) That a girl is asking  me    about Dungeons and Dragons.  (What am I, some resource on all things dorky?  I'm a little concerned that she knows, implicitly, that I am the guy to ask this sort of question.)

        Nick Adams, Vampire Slayer     I'm about two-thirds through with  I am Legend  and a question arises:  why is it impossible, or at least, apparently impossible, to write well on fictional subjects like vampires, robots and pirates (with or without large pecs and open shirts)?  Why is genre fiction so poorly written?  Why are its characters so consistently disappointing?    The easy answer here is that genre fiction doesn't need to be well-written; people read it for plot, intellectual and/or physical arousal, and escapism.  That's the standard answer, right?   But I can't be the only person out there who wants to read about emotionally complex vampire-hunters, robots and pirates (bare-chested or not).  And I can't be alone in thinking that such characters are perfectly possible, and that they can live in rich and fully-realized worlds presented to the reader in rich and fully-realized sentences. At the very least, Poe would be with me here.  It's worth noting where genre has been able to transcend its limitations.  Mystery/Crime writers like  urlLink James Ellroy ,  urlLink Walter Moseley , and to a lesser (or different) extent  urlLink Richard Price  and  urlLink Colson   urlLink Whitehead  have all been able to bend and play with the conventions of the genre to novel, compelling and, dare I say, literary ends.   Is the problem, then, perhaps a condition of fantasy, whatever form it takes?  It seems unlikely.  Consider Kafka, or the aforementioned Poe.  Barthelme, Borges, Marquez, and  countless others have lurked on the outside of strict realism and not suffered reputationally; if anything, it’s their signature.   It does seem, however, to be a condition of the written word.  Consider genre in film and television.   urlLink  Buffy the Vampire Slayer     broached a number of interesting thematics, allowed its characters a notable complexity and capacity for change over the show’s seven seasons, and has rightly attracted   urlLink literary-critical   and   urlLink philosophical  attention.  Examples in film abound; if anything, we seem willing as a culture to overestimate on  urlLink  the screen   what we turn our noses at on the page.  And that says something about our cultural relationship to artistic form; what, exactly, I’m not sure.  Perhaps we have low expectations of film and television, forms in which entertainment value, at least in terms of revenue, can be counted on to trump artistic merit.  Or, more worrisome, is the converse; that we have inflated expectations of literature to be good for us more than it entertains us.    It is, of course, a false distinction.  Intellectual engagement can and should be entertainment, and enjoyment is a multidimensional experience not dependent on the lightness of an effort alone.  But perhaps we are incredulous of this idea, falling back on the familiarity of poorly written genre novels because we can count on them for a desired effect.  Like an old roommate once told me, “If you’re going to date an ugly girl, she might as well be easy.”  This was, of course, a base sentiment and it is perhaps not a perfect analog.  But I see it like this:  because genre fiction is poorly written, we read it as an ultimately benign but guilty pleasure.  Because it is a guilty pleasure, we want it to be as guilty and as pleasurable as it can be while still being both.  Like a thirteen year old boy with a nudie mag,   Playboy  has nothing on   Hustler .   Not even the articles.

On the other hand,  urlLink the video games rocked like they haven't quite rocked since  (Via  urlLink The Presurfer ).  Somewhere along the way, we lost sight of the fact that a video game is supposed to test the body's physical memory and ability to overcome sweaty thumbs under pressure.

       Desperately Seeking a Telephone Booth   I've caught wind of the murmerings:  you people think Scott is my  urlLink alter   urlLink ego .  Did you people honestly think this?  Really.  If I was going to have an alter ego, would it be a librarian obsessed with apes and viola players?     And I know what you wiley conspiracy theorists are thinking: that I, Pete, am in fact an alter ego to Scott.  But that makes no more sense than the opposite.  Would Scott do all the research of feigning an obsession with the red sox?  Of pretending, generally, to be a oversized Italian trapped in Iowa?  To what end?  Wouldn't it be a lot simpler for me, who exists, to have just asked my friend Scott, who also exists, if he wants to post on my blog?  Ockham's Razor, people.   urlLink Ockham's Razor .  But I realize that my reasoning will not appeal to the suspicious.  You want proof.  Cyber-proof.  It's just that I'm not sure what cyber-proof would be.  I could post a picture of us, but you will just say: hey, a picture of two guys doesn't prove anything.  I could have third parties write in support of both our existences, but you will just say: hey, they're no more legit than Rick Moody.  (No, I didn't impersonate Rick Moody, but someone else easily could have.)    What would do it?  We're not about to scan in our driver's licenses, and anyway, you people would just say:  photoshop.  So what will quell the suspicions?

       Why Don't You Tell Me How You Really Feel   I need a good book to read.  I ordered Richard Matheson's " urlLink I am Legend  " this weekend, but I am impatient.  I was thinking of starting a "What is the Jones Reading?" link to a list on amazon, but really.  Who cares what I'm reading?  I'd rather know what you all are reading, what you think of it and why you think I should read it.  That might be just as self-important, but it’s a little less pretentious.     Some of you know my tastes better than others.  I like my stakes to be cosmic.  I'm less impressed by impressive-minded writing than I am by impressive content.  That said, notably bad writing trumps notably interesting content.  I‘m obsessed with death, glory and melancholia.    Scott is obsessed with apes.  I'm not being cute, either.  If you know of any great books about apes, I'm sure he would be grateful to hear about them.

       Just like a Wop   by Scott   ok you mook i did a little research myself and found an  urlLink enjoyable site  that will help clear this up. in fact it will clear up almost any dago semantics issue. We see that "mook" is basically a jerk, because it comes from "jamook," which through the years of goombah telephone has transformed into "jamoke," popular with fans of professional wrestling.   but, the definition also includes a curious postscript, "also used to describe someone who is subservient to you," which would indicate that my explanation to you of a mook being "the big boss" as not far off. So curious was this postscript that like a good journalist i  urlLink investigated  further.    urlLink This site  of "brooklynisms" explains that mook is a "knucklehead," which i suppose explains why Johnny Boy flips out upon being called one, although i would site that his character is just a little on edge. besides, aren't the other characters in that scene uncertain of what a mook really is? i remember seeing quizzical looks on their faces. as such, perhaps Johnny Boy attacks  because  of this confusion, this rift in racial identity, an insensitivity to the clandestine graces of being italian, of knowing who's "one of our boys."    thus mook has come to the current usage of "jerk" because of the audience's reliance on Johnny Boy the anti-hero to protect all that he is. still, it doesn't mean that's the definition of mook.   however i'm of the opinion that everything  urlLink harvey keitel  says is confusing. the bad lieutenant has thrown us off the scent of the truth yet again. surprise surprise. the big studio screenwriters must have had a meeting to discuss narrative disorder, and they all came to the decision that by inserting a keitel character, all the misunderstandings and laziness in their writing could be transferred to his ugly, sloping shoulders.     some other cool brookynisms: a "fugazy" is guiney for "con job," which really would send a shockwave through the rabble-rousing community of emo-rockers; a "scootch" is a real pain in the ass, a usage i think many of us could have a lot of fun with.

       What are you, a mook?   Well, that depends on what a mook is.  A lot of people have been calling me a mook lately, so I decided it was time to find out what the word means.  Even before I looked all this up, I knew that a mook, alas, is not the same thing as a  urlLink moock .  No one would have any reason to call me a gravel-toned singer in the country-blues tradition, though if they had, I wouldn't have minded.  Also before I looked this up, Scott offered the explanation that people (him included) call me a mook because the term refers to a  urlLink large Italian  with some sort of authority.  I may be a large Italian, but I ain't no boss.  That, and as far as I know from   Mean Streets  , calling someone a mook can result in a  urlLink brawl  (even if they are a large Italian, and yes, even if they have some sort of authority.)  Even if the term is applied sarcastically, like, "What are you supposed to be, a large Italian with some sort of authority?"  It doesn't seem worthy of a passionate rage.    So I turned to the internet.  The answer, unfortunately, is pretty disappointing.  To quote  urlLink The Word Detective    :   One dictionary that does deal with "mook" is the recently published Volume Two of the excellent Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang (which I will call "HDAS" to save space). According to HDAS, "mook" means "an ineffectual, foolish, or contemptible person," so your definition is certainly in the ballpark. The earliest citation HDAS lists is from 1930.   As to the origin of "mook," HDAS ventures that it is probably a variation on "moke," a slang term dating back to the middle of the 19th century. "Moke" means several things: originally, it was a slang and dialect term in England for a donkey, but it has also been used as a term of contempt for a Black person or any dark-skinned person. But "moke" has also been used since at least 1855 to mean "a foolish or inconsequential person," which certainly ties it to "mook." Unfortunately, no one has any clear idea of where "moke" came from. So I guess we'll both just have to keep digging.   Finally, a racial epithet that applies to both African-Americans  and  Italians.  Though it apparently hasn't had racial connotations for almost a hundred and fifty years.  I guess I'll have to settle for being inconsequential (and/or foolish).

       Listen to my prayer spoken without guile                                              By Scott    i bought a pair of nice expensive shoes on friday. recently i have broken up with my girlfriend and have been frequenting bars and parties to validate my score on the gender scale. a classy young professional woman who must have impressed me made a remark that has stuck with me for the course of the week: "He looks like he cares about things." she said it w/r/t a man we saw while peoplewatching, and although she would never be as careless as to use the term "metrosexual," this neologism gives you the idea. so i decided to buy some nice expensive shoes. i would begin to care about things, too.   the following night i wore my new shoes out to a friend's birthday party. i was all set to show them off. giving them a good scrub before i left, i had a bounce in my step, no doubt from the great care i imagined a small european man with suspenders put into the craftmanship of their soles. i arrived, got buzzed in, and climbed the three floors of stairs to be greeted by not by a friendly hello but instead by a yellow post-it on the door. It read "Please remember to take off your shoes." I noticed the hallway littered with pumps, sneakers, go-go boots, even some nice expensive shoes crafted in a similar manner as mine. I knocked on the door and stepped in. "please take off your shoes," my host asked me, reiterating the post-it. "we don't want to disturb our downstairs neighbors." i looked at all the shoes in the hallway, and was going to respond "well why have 50 people in your apartment getting drunk if you are concerned about your neighbors," but this host didn't know me very well, i knew the birthday girl, his roommate, and i wanted to be a good guest and respect his wishes. so, the shoes came off. after all, i reasoned,  urlLink how often do you really look at a man's shoes.   i heard about the "uninviteds" from the host, toward the end of the party. he had just spoken to three drunk men from "the neighborhood," who tried to crash the party, easing their way into the foyer of the apartment, sniffing their noses high, like booze hounddogs. the host had nicely told them in his friendliest, most patronizing voice, "sorry guys, the party's winding down." then he abruptly closed the door on them. he told me this, and a girl with whom he was attending the university with said, "well handled." i may not be getting a master's degree, but i know this party host had neglected another principle from the bastion of knowledge we call society yet again. i rushed as fast as i could out of the apartment.   of course it was too late. our host "handled" the situation of three drunk strangers on his doorstep so "well" that they had made off with over 30 pairs of shoes, including my nice expensive pair. i spun off the bannister, hopping stairs, gaining velocity as i descended. perhaps because of my speed and momentum, i was in a state where saw everything laid out before me, including the next hour in the future. everything that was to happen i already knew to be. i knew i would burst out of the apartment building into the night, that there would shoes awaiting me, that most of the shoes would be abandoned, probably in an asinine place (surely, the middle of the street). i knew the bandits weren't bandits, they were  urlLink pranksters . and i knew as such the pranksters would return. it was only a matter of waiting. wearing only my left shoe that i found in the street, i waited, poking my head around in trash cans and hedges, hunting for my absconded shoe.   i had a lot of time to think about the party host, since i was alone down on the street with my right foot freezing due to the damp pavement, and he was upstairs "hosting," a skill which already netted him 5 missing shoes (the rest were recovered by myself and my friends  urlLink Darrell and Gideon , both of whom were fiercely ready to rumble with this party host). but i saw all of this already. i knew we just had to wait. i thought about asking the party host to pay for my shoes, since justice left the responsibilty for their abduction on his shoulders as well as mine. i thought how, if i was the party host, i would offer. but this party host as i mentioned did not live in a world where shoes are stolen, or worn in the house, or make less noise than the 80s dance jams blaring out the stereo. i decided it's useless to argue with  urlLink someone  so entrenched in a world where you do not see what will be, your prayers are not answered, and you speak only to avoid the guile of others. we grew up differently, i said to myself, and i cannot blame anyone.    the pranksters did return, and we gave chase, but i had one shoe, and we knew they didn't have the shoes on them. they made off.   if this blog be the place for frustration, for rants, know that i currently wear one shoe and have a sore jaw from grinding my teeth so much. my shoe was found the following morning sleeping beneath a nearby car. of course, i've got to go there to pick it up.

      Does anyone honestly believe that Billy Crystal is funny?    When I was a kid I thought so.  But in retrospect that had more to do with the man's almost constant identification of himself as funny.  My kid logic went like this: he tells jokes.  Jokes are funny.  Here I am laughing hysterically.  After all, if humor is reprieve from concern, a commentary on the world, then it is easy to forget that kids, despite their incomplete understanding of the world around them and relatively concern-free lives, want that reprieve too.  And they'll settle for faking it, hoping they can teach themselves to find solace in what is available.  Judging from the crowd's reactions to Crystal last night, celebrities do the same thing.    In other news,  urlLink Pedro is throwing ridiculous heat on his first mound session .  I hope his arm doesn't fall off, or that if it does, it waits until he is in a yankee uniform in 2005 to do so.  The way I imagine it, the detached arm clenches a fastball and flies with a fastball's velocity, but toward third base and the unexpecting third baseman's head.  Who will take it in the teeth?  A-Rod or Jeter?  Either is fine with me.  Then the MFYs could have their own curse, like ours with the babe's crossed bats: the curse of the dismembered asshole.  Of course, he isn't an asshole yet:  if the sox sign him, he's still a good guy.  Who among the four potential free agents should be the priority?  Pedro, PECOTA projected best pitcher in baseball through 2008 has admitted that, with market adjustments, he will likely be taking a paycut; Nomar, though PECOTA projected as the best ss of 2004, still manages to want more than he is worth.  Much as I love Tek and Lowe, I would gladly drop both of them if that's what it takes to keep Pedro and Nomar.  If I can't have both, I'd rather have either than any combination of other contracts.  And if  I really, really had to commit to one or the other, I guess I'd go with Nomar.  I think he's got more gas left in the tank.  And I like the idea of a cradle to grave player.  But I don't want to choose.  I'm sure I'll find a way to be unhappy with whatever happens.

       Finally, a community for agoraphobics   Today I'm hungover and listening to Neil Young and it occurs to me that, even more than Al Gore, Young can claim to have presaged this whole interpoo thing.  Particularly, blogging.  Check out this line from  Only Love Can Break Your Heart :  "I have a friend I've never seen/He hides his head inside a dream/Someone should call him and see if he can come out/Try to lose the down that he's found,"  Indeed, someone should.  But we'll just leave comments on his blog instead.  And no.  This isn't a thinly-veiled cry for help.  It's a thinly-veiled cry for comments.

       Pulse of the Nation   Like any good sox fan, I feel a responsibility to make enemies who  urlLink will never even bother  to hate me back  (Who ees Pete Coco?).  In the interest of this, I have printed many pics off of  urlLink Dirtdogs , many of them photoshopped wonders; A-Rod in swim trunks, holding his wife, in a bikini, from behind, both in a fountain.  An almost heartwarming scene, but for her  urlLink head .  Then there's my personal favorite, Saddam Hussein in a yankees cap.  To this, I have added a speech bubble, in which Saddam accuses A-Rod of  urlLink the very act  previously reserved for Jeter alone.  I keep these things on my refrigerator.  I would frame them, but that might creep out my girlfriend.  Better to affect casualness.   Meanwhile, there's a fussy fixture in my kitchen and I am convinced that it will someday crackle and spark to my dog's, if not Adrienne's and my own, doom.  Recently, this light stopped working and we had to call our landlord.  Did he replace the fixture?  Of course not.  He stood on my kitchen table and jiggled the sockets until there was light.  (Isn't it funny how people can sometimes make you feel foolish by beong incredibly reckless?)    He did, however, leave the following note:   Tenant,  I replaced the bulbs but the fixture is old and next time we'll have to replace it.    Thanks,  Maintenance  ps- you're right, A-Rod does swallow.   And I live in  Iowa .

       Testosterone Cream?    urlLink But hey , as the article points out, there's no evidence that Bonds, Sheffield, Giambi et al, actually  used  the stuff.  You can't prove that it wasn't, say, purchased for their wives.  Or children.  Maybe they bought the cream for their kids, you know, like when your dad makes you chain smoke a whole pack of cigarettes as a lesson.  Or maybe they rubbed it on their heads like so much bryl cream.    More than anything else, this situation continues to merit a hearty "what the fuck?".

       Sweep Sweep Back's Badass Song   The Yankees can have all the  urlLink intangibles  they want.  The  urlLink tangibles  are decidedly on the side of the Red Sox lately.  Sometimes, my mother likes to remind me that the weekend I was born, the Sox swept the Yankees.  She says my Dad was euphoric to receive this blessing at the same time as he received me, his first and eventually only son.  She also talks about a  urlLink rainbow  spanning the sky, but you know, Moms are like that.  Googling for a picture of Jeter, I stumbled  urlLink this   ( marginally  worksafe; Jeter is on page two).  I'm glad to know that Gabe Kapler is  somebody's  favorite baseball player.  God Bless Pedro, God Bless Manny.  We are your overlords, Yankers.

       Useful Distraction   I've been trying, in these last weeks of my MFA, to get a lot of writing done.  Call it a mad dash to the finish line, an intense despair over the void that is my future, or maybe a clingy and preemptive nostalgia for the days of deadlines and optimism.  I won't bore you with a detailed discussion of what I am writing, though I am happy to say that I have been unusually productive.    Rather, I'll bore you with a different topic, namely:  what effect do peripheral activities have on one's writing? Particularly, I'm thinking of music and Red Sox games.  But it would be misleading if I didn't mention the internet, blogging, and Impeccable Jones in particularly.  I'll deal with each of these in posts over the next week.  But first, music.  I've noticed that I tend to listen to the same music when I'm writing productively:                    Sly and The Family Stone, " urlLink There's a Riot Going On  "                   Graham Parker, " urlLink Squeezing Out Sparks "                   X, " urlLink Los Angeles "                   Solomon Burke, " urlLink The Very Best of ,"                     Guns N' Roses, " urlLink Appetite For Destruction "                   Me First & The Gimme Gimmes,  " urlLink Have a Ball "                   AC/DC, " urlLink Highway to Hell "  This is a pretty diverse list, I think, but it finds unity in the familiarity I have with the music itself.  These are not the albums I've had in my collection the longest, but ones that I've had for several years and generally don't listen to in other contexts anymore.  I think the first track on an album is also hugely important for me, because that's the one that gets me going.  In this regard, nothing is better than "Luv n' Haight," on "There's A Riot Goin' On," because it manages to be energizing, ominous and soulful all at once.  But "Welcome to the Jungle," is pretty good too, though, mostly because it kicks so much ass.  I have to wonder how the mood of this music affects my writing.  Certainly, I think it does somehow, though I admit the possibility that I am acting like a pitcher who refuses to wash his favorite socks.  Rather than wonder about the specifics of that, I'd like to propose an experiment, open to any of you readers.  I know that a number of you are classmates of mine in the workshop, and that in addition to these people, a number of you are writers in other contexts.  This would be particularly telling with writers who usually don't listen to music when they write.  You can probably guess where I'm going with this: try it out, pay attention, and let me know how it goes.  Or, if you do listen to music when you work, try listening to something you would never listen to, try it out, and report back.

       How Do You Like Your Blue-Eyed Boy, Mr. Death?    urlLink Maud Newton  links to a  urlLink Harry Crews page  with a number of great quotations.  My personal favorites:   "Contrary to popular belief, I’m not a violent person. But if you wrong me, I’ll kill your fucking ass, and I’ll spend the rest of my life in jail. I’ll kill your fucking ass and you can count on it; depend on it."    "Faulkner’s rhetoric is the sea around us whose depth more than one of us has drowned. He is such an overwhelming talent that he has damaged a whole generation of writers, because they all come along and try to be Faulkner and to write about the stuff that to him was a blood-and-bone issue and to them only a kind of romantic nonsense. You see, you can’t fake any of this in art."   I really really want to love this guy's fiction; that the same guy could earnestly make both of the above statements makes him some sort of a genius.  Alas, I have never been able to get into him.   But if you don't believe me, and if the above is your only exposure to Crews than you really have no reason to,  try  A Feast of Snakes .

       All The Young Punks   Recently, I invested in a  urlLink CMJ  subscription because I wasn't buying any new music.  Sure,  urlLink Donovan ,  urlLink Sabbath  and  urlLink Nick Lowe  all rock like babies cry, but I was starting to miss being part of a scene, god knows why, and as great as it may be, the  urlLink ICPL  just isn't Max's Kansas City.  I got the first issue today.  Man.  I knew I'd have to wade through shit, I just didn't know it would be up past my knees.  There's some good music on the cd, and I don't regret the subscription (yet) but it's all so infernally precocious.  Two ideas occur to me:    1)  my previous idea about the appearance of individuality coming to replace actual individuality has never found more support than in the glossy photos of  urlLink up and coming indie rockers  doing their best to look both earnest and unlike each other (rampant androgyny complicates this effort, amusingly).  Even when they look like  urlLink math nerds , it's a fucking statement.   2)  I'm too young to be a curmudgeon.  And yet, here I am.  Where's a  urlLink snowglobe  when you need one?

When the dolls acted like girls, it was cool.  Morrissey acts like a girl, and he's just annoying.  In interest of science, then, it seems fair to conclude that acting like a girl is not a determining factor in coolness and/or annoyingness, but dressing in drag may help with the former and combat the latter.

      poems poems by scott  let me tell you something about poems. poems came from the trojan war. men killing and burning and raping each other while coyotes spit out the dust from what was left over. constantly the smell of shit. big wooden wheels rolling through shrubs. bruises and leaking arrowhead gashes.  so imagine my surprise when i saw an ad for the new brad pitt vehicle, Troy, with pitt as mr. greece, achilles, in what i predict to be a very trojan summer. depp last summer led a pirate craze, we want to be pirates, they shouted, and although i can't understand why, i know it can happen again. troy holds that same interior appeal. pirates are assholes, i'm hoping that greeks & trojans can become the new pirates. poets can be the new pirates.   i mentioned this to the hostess at a diner i often go to on my lunch break. do you think greeks & trojans can become the new pirates?, i asked, looking at her big hoop pirate earrings. she thought that pirates are pirates, no matter if they're new ones. the hostess has unsightly huge boobs and moves her stout body like a caterpillar across the graves of oh so many poets.

       A Brush With   Today, I inadvertently intimidated  urlLink Mo Rocca .  It's not much of a story, but the highlights:  narrow hallway, large man (me), skinny man (Rocca) standing in the way.  I said, "excuse me," and he got all flustered.  I decided not to acknowledge his Rocca-ness, because really, he knows who he is and I didn't have a lot to say about it.  When I was in college, I hooked up with a girl who claimed to have slept with  urlLink Eddie Spaghetti  but who knows if it was true.  I wonder if she told that to all the guys, and for that matter, why that is something she would tell to all the guys.  I said hi to  urlLink Peter Wolf  on the street once (he waved back), and my sister used to work in a north end restaurant frequented by members of  urlLink Extreme  and Aerosmith.  My dad is inexplicably chummy with  urlLink K.C. Jones  for reasons involving the 1970s that I will never fully understand.  All I know is that, if we're talking about people who end up on national television, Mo Rocca is probably the best I've ever done, and I can't help but feel deficient for that.  And I kind of resent feeling deficient for that.

       A-Rod's Guru    "Superstars don't think like everyone else,"  urlLink Fannin  said. "The average person has 2,000 to 3,000 thoughts a day, and 60 percent of the average person's thoughts are in chaos. The superstar has 1,100 to 1,300 thoughts a day. They eliminate worry, envy, jealousy, embarrassment and anger. The superstar thinks a lot less and holds a thought longer."   Is it me, or did he just call A-rod a simpleton?  Worry, envy, jealousy, embarrassment, anger:  they make us who we are.  Substitute "the President" for "superstar," and it's somehow both scarier and more accurate.

       A Riot of My Own    urlLink When Joe Strummer suggested it , it seemed pretty cool, a cry for individualist action, a rebellion against middle class complacency and knee-jerk values.  But when white kids actually do riot?   urlLink Over  and  urlLink over ,  urlLink it's just a bunch of dumbasses being dumbasses .  Let's not underestimate the role of Iowa in all this.  I can say that because I live and teach there.  If Iowa is the blandest common denominator of this country, then it's young people could perhaps be our truest cross-section (without that distracting factor of truly urban life that has apparently skewed me and my peers into what George Bush would call "an elite," though it's a little odd to be simultaneously elite and really poor).    These kids have the energy to riot, which is great, but really pointless without the motivation that must accompany it.  They just want to break shit, and they are so prematurely cynical about the world that they don't even pretend to have a reason to break said shit.  These kids don't even have the solace of punk rock, because even that has been  urlLink commodified  and  urlLink sold  to them en masse.  And anyway, they couldn't all be punk rockers, right?

       Suck it  Harder , Yankees   If you didn't know, the Sox picked up the second game of the series yesterday.  Today, Lowe, who was 2-0 against the Yankees last year, faces Contreras, who I don't have any numbers on off-hand, but I can confidently say to more often suck than not suck against the Sox lineup.     urlLink Alex Rodriguez, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield are a combined 0-for-19  in the first two games of the series, as the Yankees' team batting average has slipped to .206 on the season.   And, I believe, Jeter only has one hit in the series.  Let's see how classy those Yankee fans are now.

       Suck It, Yankees   All those muscle-bound, steroid-fueled assholes couldn't get the Yanks past Wakefield and the Sox last night.  Unbelievably, Pokey Reese (.192) is off to better offensive start than A-Rod (.189, 0 for 4 last night, and, in a symbolically appropriate play, caught stealing). Okay, the offensive numbers are pretty comparable in this small sample, but at least Pokey gets to play shortstop.  And  how  .  Nevermind that Pokey's numbers are only mildly disappointing, whereas A-Rod's are decidedly not good enough.  All I can say is:  Suck it.  Wake looked great, and anyone who thinks this guy was ever in need of  urlLink redemption  is missing the point.  We love that bastard and his confounding knuckleball, a whole lot more than anyone hates Aaron Boone, a grudge that seems to be a media invention more than an actual groudswell.  Aaron Boone?  Despite Fox's insistence last night that my most hated Yankee be either Bucky Dent, Aaron Boone or George Steinbrenner, I feel about Aaron Boone pretty much the way Pedro feels about Kareem Garcia:  Who the fuck is he to deserve my attention?  That game last year was lost before Wake ever took the mound, and certainly before Boone hit that home run.  (Anyway, I can think of five or six Yankees that I hate more than Boone but, inexplicably or not, weren't an option.)

It was almost like I knew I would either acclimate to suffering for have my proverbial  urlLink liver eaten daily by a hawk .  (The Teenager as stoic?  That's fucked.  I can't possibly mean that, not really.  But  something  is keeping these kids from suicide.)  But even if half the equation is getting better at life, the other half is not being terrorized, daily, by sundry assholes.  There are assholes in adult life too, of course.  But something about them seems easier to deal with.  Their behavior is more predictable, for one.  And they tend not to punch.     Yeah.  I'm sleepy with work done so I'll stop there before this gets too incoherent.  Thanks for posting again, Drew.  It's about time I had some virtual company around virtual here.

       Movies and so on.  By Drew   Pete asked me to post more.  I can't say no to that.   Pete, as we all know well, will eagerly defend the merits of Ahhnauld.   I don't always share his slavish reverence, but I'm starting to come around.   Take "Walking Tall," which stars Ahhnauld's presumptive heir, an former wrestler whom the New York Times refers to as "Mr. Rock."     The, as his friends call him, is a pale substitute for Gov. Schwarzenegger.  First off, he looks like Derek Jeter's beefed-up big brother, the one who spent some time upstate for a botched B-and-E.  The film is a hack remake of a 70s vigilante flick that piles injustices on one man until he is forced to seek revenge with the aide of a sheriff's badge and a cedar two-by-four.  The Rock has a mild charm, yet there is something so oddly bland about his whole demeanor.   When he swings his mighty log into the property and persons of his enemies, he looks, quite frankly, bored.  The Rock lacks the maniacal, toothy grin, and the signature howl of his Teutonic predecessor.  His accent is boring, flavorless, with barely a hint of ethnic or class origins.  Even his neutral coffee complexion seems ho-hum--he makes Arnold's boiled pink bulk seem edgy and alive.  I can't help but think that a few more years of this (and the frustrations of running the world's sixth-largest economy) will lead to a triumphant return, as the man himself returns from his sojourn in Sacramento to handily dispatch of his would-be usurpers like Odysseus smiting so many suitors.  In keeping with these disappointments, "The Alamo" was a mess.  The film labors to scrape off the heavy varnish of dime-novel mythology that coats the 1836 siege of the Alamo. Yet, as soon as they expose the bare greed, arrogance, and slavery that rest within that haggard Spanish mission, the filmmakers get nervous, and they hastily slap on a fresh layer of honey-colored gloss.    You end up wishing they were a little less apologetic  (like the makers of the chauvinist and yet delightful "Master and Commander") and just let the story breathe. The only standout in this awkward jumble of de- and re-mythologizing is Billy Bob Thorton, whose Davy Crockett is all this film is not: brash, likeable, self-aware, and fun.   I'd ask Pete to dissect the latest man-movies he's seen, but I suspect he's a little busy.

("The Boys Are Back in Town," "Warrior," etc.)  "I've Got Something Against You," comes to mind, but perhaps that's just because I recently got Pixies Tickets.   Suggestions?

       Could You Repeat the Question?    I'd say President Bush is a master of rhetorical misdirection, but that would imply that his efforts are not transparent.  I guess that just makes him a slippery liar, huh?  He treats questions as prompts for prepared talking points, not answers, no matter how relevant they may or may not be.  The best one can hope for is that he will repeat a word or phrase from the question in his otherwise non-sequitur "answer."  (Q: "Mr President, do you feel apples?"  A:  "I'll tell you what, I sure do feel oranges.")   Tonight, in a press conference littered with gems, my personal favorite was when Bush was asked what has been his biggest mistake (post-trading Sammy Sosa, post-911).  Totally flustered, he said he couldn't think of an answer.  ("The spotlight," he claimed.  "The pressure.")    Who is this guy?  I've given better answers to tougher questions interviewing to work in a grocery story.  And I  didn't   get the job.  How, again,  urlLink did   urlLink he   urlLink get   urlLink his ?

       Respect my Authority    urlLink Who knew Robots could be assholes too .    Look at that swagger.  (via  urlLink Itchy Robot )  I can't tell if this is serious or not, largely because of the caption at the bottom of the screen and the awkwardly serious note that ends the film.  Still, I smell satire.  I just can't believe there is anyone on this planet who is simultaneously capable of building a robot and not heeding James Cameron's warnings about  urlLink giving   urlLink them   urlLink guns .  Assuming for a moment that this is serious, why is it presented as an option exclusive to the third world?  Because there they don't have the political apparati to prevent it from happening?  Or because of some more nefarious, imperialist agenda is at work?    This seems like an appropriate time to unveil my robot poem.  Some of you are familiar with this poem and I apologize for subjecting you to it again.  Scott:  please show it to your boss and see if you can get me published.   I am afraid of robots, afraid that they will smear my  electric outlets with peanut  butter and cackle new wave when my dog electrocutes herself.  Fucking Robots  Think they’re so smart just because they don’t get hungry.

       Weird    urlLink Carbon monoxide poisoning scares me .  It's the new  urlLink radon .      I'm not a praying man, but when I was thirteen, my sunday school teacher made us go around the room and offer a prayer for someone.  My classmates prayed for their parents, siblings, friends, etc., and I prayed for John Candy, who had just died.  At the time I didn't understand why this caused such a titter.  So, those of you who do pray, please pray for Weird Al.  The rest of us will just hope that he doesn't write a song about this experience.  What would be worse:  a satirical send-up of a current pop song about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning?  Or an earnest ballad about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning written by  Weird Al Yankovic  ?  If I was him, I'd really be wishing I wasn't him right now, you know what I mean?  No one would take him seriously, or if we did, it would be uncomfortable in the same way that it was uncomfortable when, suddenly, John Ritter was a comedy god simply because he was 1) dead and 2)  we all know his name.    Not to speak ill of the dead, of course.  But sometimes we talk about them like conspicuous eavesdroppers.  And that doesn't seem to be what anyone would want.

       Frank and (a Hill of ) Beans   Brian Daubach, my favorite '01 Dirt dog, has been given the pink slip to make room for no one's favorite '01 Dirt dog, Frank Castillo.  I went to four or five games at Fenway that season and by some creul twist of fate, Frankie pitched every  one, losing all.  (In games, I have attended, the Sox are something like 1-15.  I know.  I'll avoid the world series in Chicago.  My karma is generally bad.  I lose all my money within fifteen minutes of entering a casino.  I am cosmically fucked in everyway that doesn't really matter.)  I trust that Theo knows something I don't, but even if we do have a glut of bench bats and a dearth of long relief, I can think of at least three guys to get rid of before Dauber(McCarty, Crespo, Jones).  I suppose this is temporary until Kim is back and Arroyo can return to the pen, but let's look at a career  comparison between Daubach and McCarty, the two most comparable bench players as DH/1B, OF in a pinch, type of guys:                                                     BA/OBP/SLG/OPS  Daubach      .262  .342  .480   .822    McCarty       .240  .301  .366   .668   And, Daubach is two years younger.  Granted, McCarty can technically pitch, but I'd rather have a hitter with consistently decent numbers and a pitcher than a mediocre hitter who can technically throw a strike and a pitcher.  After all, this move is all about avoiding situations in which we have to take a position player off the bench and onto the mound, right?  The day we come to rely on McCarty for his pitching is the day I throw a shoe at my television.  Hard.

       Vamos   The Pixies have extended their reunion tour, and I was able to get tix for the Chicago show in November for $590 less than $625.  (Actually, when you factor in all those fees Ticketmaster makes up, it was more like $580 less.)  To all my Chicago people:  hope to see you there, November 13.  The tickets just went on sale today, so there are probably some still available if you move fast.  I was looking through the comment threads, and I am glad to say I have finally pissed someone off (though apparently mildly).  Maybe glad isn't quite the word; I'm not particularly proud or ashamed of the post in question.  I don't think it is is worth either apologizing for or defending, so I'm not going to do either.  But hey, a comment is a comment, and I'm always glad to get one.  I used to take a lot of pleasure in being offensive.  My old band even made a minor, local career out of conscientiously pissing off our audience.  People used to say things to me like, "I love you, but you're an asshole," or just, "you're (such) an asshole."  I was fine with this.  Maybe I just liked the attention; maybe I was simply immature.  But in my own mind, it was a question of rebellion, of struggling to set myself apart in a subculture that claimed to be about individuality but was really as viciously uniform as a fraternity during pledge week.  I was so proud of myself.  I was a self-appointed inquisitor to the punk scene, and quite obnoxious.  In retrospect, anyone who did like me probably managed to do so despite my self-conscious efforts rather than because of them.  (Something that is maybe true of all good friends in all situations.)     I've lost the fire, thank God, but I'm still willing to say things I don't mean if I think they're funny or otherwise worth saying.  Perhaps this is a bad habit.  Depending on my mood, I will pick a fight from either side of a question.  Maybe being contrary isn't a problem so much as being ornery and contrary at the same time.

      I've been trying to teach my dog to howl.  She's not a particularly loud dog, but will bark on occasion.  The game goes like this:  I howl, varying the inflection from loud to soft, high to low, and she wags her tail, sits by my feet and barks along, paying close attention, and soon enough she's  trying  to howl.  Her success varies, but the look on her face, the "Holy Shit!  You speak Dog?" it's priceless.

       Night of the Dawn of the Day of the Dead   Last night I watched all three of George Romero's Dead movies consecutively, a fine occasion to wrap lil' smokies in crescent rolls, drink whiskey in the dark and enjoying some fine company.  This was the first time I saw  Day of the Dead  .    It sucked in every way that  Dawn of the Dead   rocked, relying on cheap convention and gore where its predecessor managed, I think, to be truly innovative and psychologically interesting.  (It is tempting to make this symbolic of the difference between 70s and 80s cinema writ large, but I'm not really informed enough to do that.  Certainly, I'm not the first person to make this point about film history.  It reminds me of the Southern Reconstruction; perhaps this country's most progressive moment in history, often mistaken for a failure when, in fact, it was consciously and explicitly dismantled by reactionary forces.  Okay, so it's a pretty thin connection...)  If you are ever inspired to watch six consecutive hours of walking dead, allow me to recommend the substitution of the third movie in the cycle with the thematically (and otherwise) similar but vastly superior 28 Days Later .  The relation between Romero's three movies is loose enough that the progressing chronology is the most important link.    28 Days Later  could easily stand in as post Night/Dawn, just make sure to watch the alternate ending (the one in a hospital) to avoid the movie's biggest flaw, it's final scene.

       French Toast   I saw  The Count of Montecristo  last night, and seems that Jim Caviezel will be able to make a career out of  urlLink shaggy   urlLink beards and earnest intonations .  But more importantly, I honestly enjoyed the movie.   urlLink Luis Guzman  cemented his title as my favorite actor of all time, and I was reminded why, exactly, I am on this quest to find the great genre novel.  This adventure stuff is just fun and I don't see why it seems to definitionally come at the expense of character and good prose (or, why it has consistently done so for the past century.)  I also decided that if ever I have an opportunity to include in my own writing a death duel that results in mercy and lifelong companionsip, then I will.  Also, treasure maps.

       The Bionic Ape   What would you rather have?  A lead-off hitter who goes 5 for 5, or a centerfielder who robs three-run homers with Luigi-esque jumps?  But, you say: Pete, these are both important elements of the game.  How can I choose? Or, you say:  [something I don't understand, some statistical analysis that, based on my half-assed knowledge of statistical analysis, finds a convoluted way to prioritize offense over defense].  Or, you say:  5 for 5 what?  Can we talk about something other than baseball?  I'm bored.  Well, I say:  if you don't mind rooting for a caveman, you can have a guy who is both.   urlLink Johnny Damon kicked some serious Oriole ass last night .

        Just because you've got jesus in your heart doesn't mean you can't have something else in (or on) your crotch.     urlLink Big Church  has invaded my consciousness via their ads on hotmail.  The site looks non-denominational, but they all seem to agree that there are only two types of daters:  Men seeking women and, you guessed it, women seeking men.  I'm not particularly surprised by this, but coupled with the service's recent prominence, I can't help if this is an elaborate gambit in the culture wars.  This is probably as good a time as any to say that girls who talk about God as more than a philosophical conundrum scare me.  I don't care how attractive they are.  I think it all goes back to my sunday school teacher when I was fourteen who was undeniably gorgeous, and not just in that dressed in white, "if only she would take off her glasses and loosen up" way.  This was not some fetishization of innocence, purity, virginity or virtue: this woman was hot as a habanero and she knew it.  This was the early 90s so she dressed like a Pearl Jam fan; velvet, corduroy, flannel and other grungy fabrics available at Caldors or Bradlees, but also illustrious blonde hair, short skirts (really) and red lipstick.  This girl would have been at home on  urlLink MTV's The Grind .  We all had big crushes on her, and she even flirted with us.  She was very touchy-feely, and maybe it is her fault that for the next four years I was entirely unable to pick up physical cues from girls that they were interested in me (Really.  I knew my sunday school teacher wasn't going to sleep with me, so when other girls rubbed my arm and laughed at my jokes like she did, I had trouble thinking it meant very much.)   I know this all sounds peachy and nostalgic, but herein lies the rub: despite her jezebel-for-Jesus nature, she also talked incessantly about demons, eternal damnation, and attrition.  She talked about Jesus the way sex-deprived women sometimes talk about chocolate.  She alternately creeped us out and turned us on and it wasn't long before this got confusing and, well, guilt-ridden.

       The Sky is, in fact, Right Where You Left It    urlLink Schill the Chill keeps the Sox from going two games under .500 for the first time in eight years .  Even if those two games would have been the only ones played, us dorks must work with the numbers we are given.  Along the same lines, the D-Rays are still dominating the AL East, and the Overmen are in last place.   (Damn the law of averages.  Statistical prediction can feel a little too godly sometimes.)  It is incredibly unlikely that anyone reading this would simultaneously care, not know already, and be able to attend, but I am giving a reading tonight at The Mill in Iowa City at 9 pm along with Poet Steve Kramp.  If you are one of the few, please come.  The estimable Jane Roper and Jared Stanley will provide introductions.  If anyone is wondering why Scott is so uncharacteristically quiet lately, it's because he just got a job, inexplicably, at  urlLink Poetry Magazine .  Yes, that  urlLink Poetry Magazine , and no, I can't explain how this happened.  So he's busy and all, but he also needs our help.    When asked what poets he likes, the best Scott was able to tell his shaggy and bespectacled co-workers was that he digs Denis Johnson and Jim Morrison.  Okay- he didn't say the last one, but he might as well have, they were so unimpressed.  So:  what poets should Scooter read and/or claim to have read?  There's employment on the line here, people.  I listed the poetry faculty for him here at the workshop,but that is a short supply of names and it will probably run out by the end of the week.    In comments, please complete the following sentence:  "Hi.  My name is Scott.  No, it's okay, you don't remember my name.  Really.  I was reading the poetry of _______ this weekend and I was really impressed by the manner in which he/she used _________ to convey_________.  It's ___________, really."  I'll put all your answers on notecards and mail them to Scott so he can practice in front of the mirror.  But seriously, folks.  Scott's Impeccable congratulations is a little overdue:  good work, bro.  And yes, I am razzing him a bit.  I know few people who would be more at home working for a lit mag.

        Alienated from my Fandom    urlLink Bambino's Curse  links to an  urlLink interesting discussion  by Glenn Stout on the uniqueness of Red Sox failure.  BC's own choice of quotation is telling, and being as I'm totally copping his post as it is:   I really think fans of most teams, in most sports, can probably recite their own unique litany of failure and pain -- Red Sox fans aren’t that special. What is unique is that since 1986 that precise emotional vibe has been exploited and marketed to make money. And too many Sox fans (and way, way too many casual fans here and elsewhere, and an absolutely obscene number of no-nothing broadcasters) have gobbled it up because it goes down quick and easy and seems to explain everything. It’s instant Red Sox history, antiseptic, without having to deal with the real nasty stuff, like racism and incompetence.   But at this point it’s too late, almost -- a kind of historic expectation of loss has permeated both the fans and the organization, a willing desire to believe in the worst just so you can feel part of something larger. Even new ownership is affected. When they bought the club they were essentially ignorant of club history, apart from the "curse" nonsense. And any psychologist will tell you that negative thoughts can lead to negative consequences, so in a sense it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy -- it flows back and forth between fans and media and by osmosis even reaches the players, who are usually so narcissistic they aren’t affected by anything.

       Charlie Parts the Seas    The Red Sox lost the season opener to the Orioles, but that's okay, because The Ten Commandments was on TV. Scott has claimed before, and I think he's right, that Schwarzenegger is the Heston of our generation.  Then again, Arnold never made a biblical epic, which, depending on your perspective, is either a shame or, well, a shame.  (Like "future" cars of the 50s, an era's take on the bible says more about the era than it does about the bible.  While Charlie makes Egypt look like an Epcot exhibit, Mel makes a snuff film out of the crucifiction.  I swear: artistic "credibility" is ruining the bible.)   I was in Chicago this weekend and it made me realize how long it has been since I've spent time in a real city.  The novelty of arguing commuters on the El, or the cab driver who fell asleep at every stoplight was overwhelming, but then I realized that it really shouldn't be.  Have I turned into a yokel?  Oh, Iowa; I tire of your bucolic shittiness.  There was once a Pete who, at most, would have turned a stony gaze to such novelty.  I used to be tough to impress.  Really.  But Iowa, like the humongous vat of acid that it is, has stripped me of my insularity.  The light of day hurts my eyes.

      Coprolalia by scott  Today on the el I encountered some poor man with coprolalia, an uncontrollable urge to cuss. This is symptomatic of Tourette's, a disease of disinhibition. I didn't get the chance to ask the man if he had Tourrette's because he was busy heckling the train car with his obscenities. Which, of course, he couldn't control. The sad part, rather, the part that made it for me, was that all his swearing was fucking hilarious, and almost appropriate. For example, some girl's cell phone rang, and in between his Yosemite Sam-like shouting of "fucking fuck shit fucking hellshit" he paused to direct his face at her, and yelled "fucking cell phone bitch fucking fuck can't you fucking turn that hellshit off i fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck ask fucking you." Then some huge guy came on the train at north & clybourn and mr. coprolalia went right into him. "fucking burger tits! hellshit burger burger shits tits! fuck those burger tits!" this huge guy looked around, to see if this was for real, and saw people trying to ignore the cusser, like he was someone begging for money. of course, i was giggling uncontrollably to myself. Once mr. coprolalia saw me laughing, he gave me the "fucking funny FUCK FUCK hellshit! arrgh! take my fucking asscap!" treatment.

      Postcards because I'm on a Mac by scott  For some reason, and the computer dude here verifies, i cannot post links due to the fact that i'm on a Mac. So all of my posts these next two weeks, in pete's stead, will be without links. Unless the "Blogger Help" really comes through. If some site grabs me and i feel it's worth the Impeccable reader's time, i will paste the link at the bottom of the post.   That said, now i want to point out that the man every writer loves to hate, dave eggers, will be appearing in chicago next weekend for the annual printer's row book fair. my own problem with eggers is that everything is a joke to him, often a joke he could expand into a clever literary device, but you might have another gripe with him. Anyone who can inspire as much enmity as eggers does is worth the price of admission. It's the same reason why i went and paid good money for "Soul Plane" (it was horrible beyond belief). I'm finding there's intrinsic value in our culture for something, some "art," that's quite bad. Its badness transcends.   An example: just last week i was at a hipster party, and these hipsters were talking about eggers and mcsweeneys. Their wrath was extensive, and some even pointed out their gripes with acumen (my fav was this hipster pointed out that he didn't like eggers or mcswys because they have brought a 'hip' element to literature, one with their marketing and graphic design skills, and hipness apparently had no place for this hipster in his canon), however these impasses did not prevent the hipsters from handing their money over for mcsweeneys subscriptions. The mag has value, and its value is in its badness. I'm saying "badness" because of its subjective touch, know that i'm really clueless to how people ascribe value to anything anymore.   link:  http://www.chicagotribune.com/extras/printersrow/program.htm

      Bon voyage, Pierre et sa petite amie  by Drew  The big man's headed to the Old World.    I'm smirking at the thought of Pete crammed into a Smartcar, Pete towering over a bustling mob of ruddy-faced locals.  Also, a word of warning:  don't even try to speak a Slavic language.  There's only one word you need:  "Angliski?"  You will be missed.  And I will try to post, as work is getting lighter soon.  Hope you and the little lady have a wicked good time.

       A Not So Brief Hiatus   Tomorrow will be the first day of my European tour, even if it will only bring me to Minnesota, where we will drop off the dog with Adrienne's parents and later fly fly fly to Hungary.  I'll try to post in between bowls of goulash and other cultural wonders, but who knows how possible that will be.  I'll be back for sure on June 12th.    The good news is that Scott has agreed to pick up the impeccable slack, and I'd like to take this opportunity to ask Drew to post more in these coming weeks as well.  But go easy on these guys; they actually have jobs.    Have an impeccable couple weeks, impeccable masses (dozens).

       Trust Phil Collins    I was wondering when our resident Impeccable Historian Emeritus would weigh in on Colonial House.  Drew, I'm glad you took the bait.  We seem to agree on a lot of points  (which makes me feel smarter and more informed than I probably am).  But in particular, two things seem worth highlighting: 1)  this isn't "History" anymore than Survivor is "Game Theory" and 2)  Bethany is a real fox.  Okay, and 3) the real value of this show is not in what it purports to be, but in the social psychology of the project: The psychology of reenactment is more interesting than the reenactment itself.  The actor trumps the character; the artifice trumps the content; the Baptist trumps the Puritan.  Perhaps this is the only potential strength of any reality television:  the layering of artifice and the negotiation that occurs between these layers within and between participants.  This isn't as solid a strength as, say, those that attend truth and its pursuit, and I think that it is our cultural tendency to inflate the value of overdetermination.  (Why should multiple but thin layers of meaning be nore thrilling than one, as thick as an iceberg?)  Nonetheless, this is the world we live in (oh oh oh)and these are the hands we're given (oh oh oh), so it's worth valuing Colonial for what it does better than any of its competition.     After all, if I really wanted to learn about colonial America, I wouldn't watch TV.  I'd read a book.  I'd talk to Drew, or, if I was particularly ambitious, I would consult with primary documents.  Contrary to the claims of sundry cable networks, TV isn't the most efficient way to learn  (in fact, so much of "informative" programming seems designed to provide as little information as possible while simultaneously maintaining the illusion of providing more).  But TV is one hell of a conduit for drama, and drama is nothing if not psychology under pressure.

        Colonial History AND Babes?    by Drew  Like Pete, I have been watching   Colonial House   on PBS, but unlike Pete, my interest goes a little beyond cocktail-party depth:  I have a master's in colonial American history and next fall, I will begin my PhD in the subject.  Naturally, I have some complaints: the voiceover is prone to sweeping generalizations, and the native issue is rushed through in a business-like, "let's-take-our-pc-medicine-and-be-done-with-it" way, despite the clear conflict it raises with the group.  The producers don't highlight the baldly racist remark from the Texas minister's wife, who tells her son that Indians are still a menace: "Don't you watch the ten o'clock news?"  I wonder if that remark got back to John, who is part Pauite Indian, although his main concern seems to be avoiding yanks on his leash by his wife, Michelle.   Michelle is a real piece of work; she's at her best scowling while being tied to the post with a scarlet D (for "dissembler") pinned to her frock.  Not that she didn't have it coming, the skinny-dipping-on-Sabbath Jezebel. I love how, as Pete notes, she saddles her kid with BOTH a uniquely-pronounced ethnic first name and an awkward hyphenated last name.  Of course, the real strength of the show is not history.  It's seeing PBS do reality TV.  They refuse to distill their subjects into the usual reality-show archetypes, leaving me empathizing with people I did not expect to.  How is it that I, the future member of the liberal intelligentsia, end up largely siding with Jeff, the Republican, homophobic, Southern Baptist minister?    It's not just because his daughter Bethany is a fox.  It's because Jeff, despite his flaws, is an admirable leader, father, and person.  He surprises me again and again, particular in his decision not to coerce people into attending Sabbath services, believing that it just isn't right.  He is a sharp contrast to Don, the lefty religion professor with a ham-faced second wife, who DOES want to force people into the congregation simple to be true to the historical experiment.  Throughout this struggle, you can't help but admire Jeff's walk-the-talk brand of Christianity more than Don's lecturing approach to faith.  Ned Flanders trumps Reverend Lovejoy.  But, in a later episode that deals with an indentured servant coming out of the closet, we learn that Don warmly accepts his lesbian daughter while Jeff disapproves of how the servant turned the Sabbath into a day of gay acceptance.  Still, even in an intolerant moment, Jeff surprises. He does not rain brimstone down on the "sinner," and he does seem somewhat sympathetic to his castmate's struggle for identity.  (However, his wife looks upset to find that a homosexual has infiltrated her little Puritan village.)      Colonial House   has its problems.  Unforeseen events, including a real-life tragedy that causes constant cast changes, make the show seem disjointed and messy, although, as the narration is always quick to point out, uncertainty and change defined the early colonial period.  Historically, the show does a fine job with "living history" (i.e., exploring material conditions of the past) but has only mediocre success with "critical history" (i.e., exploring the causes, motivations, and morals of the past).    Too often, the show and its participants blunder into thinking that just because they've replicated the physical conditions of an early New England, they now have instant access into the colonists' psychic and social world.  They don't, of course.  When one man compares the strict colonial laws to "Nazi Germany," he inadvertently makes a bigger point: these people are lousy historians.  While they do gain some insight into the logistical problems of colonists, they end up learning far more about the present than the past.

      On June 14th, my old pal  urlLink Patrick Somerville  will read from his  urlLink One Story  publication in NYC at  urlLink Arlene's Grocery .  If you're in the area, please attend.  An excerpt:   I had been involved in pressurized and spray-on cheeses for over a decade. I would say that only three or four men in the American gustatory industry—DeGrolun and Franklin unquestionably, Carmichael and Nussbaum perhaps—knew more than I did about the canning and containment processes of integrated synthetic cheeses. I spent six years at Frito-Lay and was independently contracted at Oscar Meyer during their mid-nineties run at the first pre-cooked cheese hotdog. I was there to provide information concerning the possible manipulations of ewe milk.   Congrats to Pat.  The story looks great; I'll be ordering my copy.

       The Babes of Colonial House     There's no greater television experience than suddenly realizing a program is trying to entertain you in particular.  Even better is when you find the programs targeting you without having to watch commericials.  That's right,I am a PBS viewer: middlebrow, well-educated, and generally content with half-assed intellectual pursuits.  (Sure, we'll go to grad school for one discipline or another, but in most things, we are content with enough knowledge to get through a cocktail party of our peers.)   We privately delight in noting historical inaccuracies, grammatical mistakes and the many other intellectual failings of those around us.  We  urlLink hyphenate our last names , we eat biscotti, and  urlLink we give our kids stupid names .  Make no mistake:  I don't really want to be in this demographic and I do my best to rebel by doing drugs, listening to loud music, and making fun of my peers.  But damnit, if my viewing habits are any indicator, I'm doomed.  Because  urlLink Colonial House  is the best show on television.   The show is, of course, reality television, but at least it's what reality television should be rather than what it usually is.  It's easy to forget that such programming needn't appeal to our basest interests or outrage us to be entertaining.  I'm not going to pretend that Colonial House is more educational than it is.  This is the adult equivalent of  urlLink Where in the World is Carmen San Diego ; mildly informative, but, more to the point, able to capture that part of our imaginations that makes us want to learn even if it isn't teaching us very much.  But to be honest, after watching, I didn't revisit my college history books: I went to bed.  The real stroke of genius, I think, is the inclusion of 1) true to life religious-freaky baptists and 2)indentured servants.  No one is in "character" per se, but the show does a fantastic job of manipulating the circumstances to highlight certain behaviors and interactions.  This is social psychology more than it is History.  But man.  What's with  urlLink all   urlLink the   urlLink colonial   urlLink babes ?  Let's just say I'd buy the calendar.

(That's right, you hip fuckers:  smirk away.)  But I really dig how the process is just involved enough to make "listening to records" an activity in a way that "listening to cds" just isn't.

       Reluctantly Forsaking Johnny Christ   The most  urlLink recent rumor on SOSH  is that the Sox could trade Kim and Damon for Carlos Beltran, Baseball's "next" big thing in a three-way trade involving Seattle's Freddy Garcia.  Certainly, this is exciting.  As much as I hate to  urlLink forsake the christ , the numbers are clear.  (My girlfriend, never convinced by numbers, was quite upset when I told of this rumor.  She was against Nomar/Manny for Mags/A-Rod too.  She doesn't care if the sox win, just that they be sexy and have personality.)  To my understanding, losing Kim and Damon's contracts (assuming they are taken in full, a big assumption) makes room for much of the money that it would take to lock up Beltran this winter.    This looks pretty good.  My only question is how it affects negotiations with Nomar.  There's talk that the Yankees  urlLink might put Boone at second base  as soon as this summer, so perhaps that affects Nomar's options to our team's benefit.  But I've got to wonder if that rumor of Nomar going to the Yankees was paranoid delusion in the first place.  I'm more worried about the Dodgers or, worse, the Angels.  The upside, at least, is that we'd have both through this season, which would cement an overlording line up.  And after that, Beltran would be the guy to stick with.  The two put up eerily comparable offensive numbers in 2003, but it's fair to assume that, given their relative ages, Nomar will decline while Beltran gets better.  And there's nothing to say that management doesn't plan to get a heavier bat on second base if Nomar leaves (Vidro?)   Reel him in, Theo.

      Sing me to sleep by Scott  Last week I saw an oragutan give birth at the Lincoln Park Zoo. I was at work, sheepishly packing up rejections into the self addressed stamped envelopes that convicted felons send me, along with their illegible sonnets of loss and unspeakable regret, when the normally placid NPR voice suddenly had something to say. I didn't catch the details, as this was a news blurb of some kind probably tossed in to kill time, but the voice said that an ape at the LPZ was ready to give birth, and the zookeepers anticipated labor to begin around lunchtime. The labor time of a greater ape is greatly less than that of a human woman. My colleage and I played hooky and arrived at the zoo around 11am. I spent a half hour looking for a disposable camera since i knew this would be a life-changing experience, one I would need to capture on film. Unfortunately I procured nothing, since the gift shop mysteriously "sold out" all the cameras last week and hadn't received a "new shipment." Literally aghast, I almost floored the poor little black woman behind the counter with my fury. My colleage pulled me out of the gift shop, reminding me of our purpose. I managed to yelp that I was going to set the gift shop on fire. I wish to God sometimes that I had better coping skills. My outburst put the little black woman on the phone to security, which led to my colleage and I running through the birds of prey house at top speed to arrive at the primate den and escape being thrown out before we got a chance to see the miracle.   The ape did not need a midwife, or any help from human or primate. This birthing was a testament to the large pelvis and non-bipedalism movement of the ape. Anyway the coolest thing for me was during the birth, the little ape came out face-up, which is 90 degrees rotated for you only familar with human births. I'm standing above on a mezzaine, looking down at the birth from an awkward angle, kind of like where i'd imagine they'd stick extra doctors in a hospital curious to watch a surgery. The little ape's shoulders appeared, then his arms, which he reached up with and clutched the hair of his mother's abdomen. Then, with more intestinal fortitude than most fucking soliders in this country, the little ape yanked himself out, all the while keeping his eyes on his mother. She scooped him up and attended to him, then the zookeepers came out wearing plastic coats and cut the cord and  sopped up all the blood and placenta. It made me realize how unfit for life most human babies are, and how I wished apes would just learn how to use computers and kick all our asses.   then a bunch of zoo volunteers started passing around clipboards. At first I became nervous because I thought I was going to have to fill out a survey for the zoo, and this survey would include my personal information, which, coupled with the video surveillance, the zoo security would use to match me to my arson threats in the gift shop, and they'd encroach upon me that night while I sat watching Everwood, totally unsuspecting. But the clipboard featured only three questions, and two rasterized lines for me to write a response. The first: What is your name? (and Phone #?) The second, What would make a good name for Bongo's baby?   Bongo is not the best name for your mom, so I desperately wanted to help this ape. After filling out Peter Coco's name and phone number on the first line, I looked up from the clipboard just in time to see this dude walk by with his little daughter by the hand. He had a slick rockabilly haircut, a very large head of hair, and there were some fresh-cut flowers stuffed into a back pocket of his jeans. That was enough for me, so I wrote "Morrissey" on the second line.

               The Dog of War   I love my dog, and because she isn't a cat, I think it's okay for me to talk about that love here at Impeccable Jones.  She manages to be both lazy and a lot of fun, and I have immeasurable respect for the fact that she really will eat anything.  She's smart too; she knows both my name and my girlfriend's, and can do any of 10-12 tricks in exchange for food.  She isn't much of a guard dog-- her reactions to people and objects always fall somewhere between adoration and fear-- but hey, I can take care of myself.  Even if her love for me is simple, it is infinite, and I can only hope to return the favor.  (According to the vet, I return this favor a little too readily.  He says she's overweight.  But fuck him.)    A note on the photo:  this is not a knock on Dean.  Lucy only eats that which she loves.  And whatever it's worth, I only had that sticker because I had just voted for the guy.

        Live Nude Boobs   Last night, like a lot of my friends and some of you reading this, I had strange boobs in my face.  Some notes:          -Last night, reunited with my girlfriend after returning from the strip club, I answered the following question:  "Well, did  you  pay for the lap dance?"  I answered correctly (and honestly) when I said, "No."  This got me off the hook.  I can see how this makes a difference, but not as much as the difference between having boobs in my face and not having boobs in my face.  It's worth noting how lucky I am to have this girl.           -I've noticed this before, but it bears repeating:  after awhile in a strip club, there are so many exposed boobs that it becomes remarkably like a place with no exposed boobs at all.  This extends to other facets of the experience: the dancers are so flirtatious that they might as well not be flirtatious at all.   They put their boobs in your face and the experience is so devoid of genuine affection that it is more like an obligatory hug from a distant relative than it is like foreplay.           -Going to a strip club with a bunch of writers is different than going with, say, anyone else.  Everyone's taking notes, forcing dances on their friends out of affection and mild guilt, and we all feel at a remove from the experience, drunk but also self-conscious.  (Don't take this the wrong way, guys; this is how I felt, and maybe I'm unfairly assuming you felt the same way.  I didn't used to feel this way in strip clubs, so that's the basis for my assumption: being with you all.)  We choose our favorites not on the size of their boobs but by how much they seem to genuinely enjoy what their doing.  It's remarkable, in the midst of so much pretense, how clear this can be.           -If you ask one of last night's bachelors, he'll tell you that receiving a lapdance and then later overhearing the stripper in question talk about picking up her kids in the morning gives a unique perspective on all this.  Related to the above, the pretense of a strip club is so comprehensive and obvious that it paradoxically becomes encompassed by a larger honesty.  No one can fairly claim to be "duped" by any of this; all the cards are on the table.  For this reason, then, it becomes a sort of absurdist drama, everyone simultaneously playing roles (the vixen, the man as dog, etc) and being themselves (mothers, bachelors, mild-mannered writers et al).  There's something almost poignant about this, because we are all playing roles all the time at the same time as we are being ourselves.  In a strip club, at least, we do so in a controlled environment (no touching, no biting) in which the results are the same every night and more or less innocuous .  And I can see the legitimate comfort in that.  That said, everytime I wake up the day after a night spent in a strip club, I sort of decide I don't ever need to go again.

       A Mystery   According to my sitemeter, I was on IJ last night for 45 minutes well after I had thought I was asleep.  I have no history of sleepwalking and neither does my girlfriend.  Likewise, the dog was in her crate and has yet to demonstrate any facility with the internet.  I'm mildly creeped out here.  Is there an obvious explanation that I'm missing?  The Hobbes I was reading this morning is suddenly relevent; memory as indistinguishable from imagination as indistinguishable from decayed sense.  I love that crazy royalist bastard.

       Meet me in the Occult Section of Barnes & Noble   It occurred to me the other night that I knew a lot of people in high school who insisted they had magical powers.  And this wasn't, "I can run the speed of sound," or "I can fly," but "I pickle frog's brains, make a paste of them mixed with a lock of my true love's hair, and offer it up to my god on an altar of pine boughs.  I may or may not wear a cloak."  These kids had a patient answer for every skeptical question and they corroborated each other's abilities.  Some of them were the sorts of kids who otherwise seemed to be the type that would claim such powers (long hair, acne, dungeon master's guide, etc), others did not.  Some of these kids aligned themselves with the forces of light, others Satan.  It was all very confusing for me, fourteen and trying to distinguish the sometimes counterintuitive facts of adulthood from this elaborate bullshit.  I was never fully convinced, but there were times when they outnumbered me, and would all enter a trance of astral projection while I stared at the woodpaneling or played Sega.  Sometimes it seemed that I was the only person in the world who was skeptical, that even the basketball team was slinging incantations here and there.  To this day, I have a vestigial belief in the occult that parallels my feelings on the Catholicism of my youth: I don't want to be punished for getting it wrong.  I would like to avoid an unnecessary hex/damnation.  This is not so much a belief as  urlLink a placating gesture toward forces that may or may not exist .    Some of these witches and warlocks are still friends of mine, and as far as I know, when they look back onthis period of their lives with embarrassment.  But I can't be sure, because I'm not really sure how to bring up the topic.  Okay, yes, I'm a little afraid to bring up the topic.

       Beauty Considered    urlLink The NYTimes misses the point on reality television and plastic beauty .  The problem isn't that we're all going to look the same, or that beauty will become boring, but that the relationship between the product and the consumer has become so tricky as to be much more than simply disingenuous.  What we think we want isn't what we actually want, and what we're getting isn't so much either as it is universal in whatever it actually is (outrageous, if you ask  urlLink Chicha , but I think it can be other things as well; the point is not how it hits us, but that it hit a majority of us the same way.)    A good example of this is market-researched endings to movies.  Does anyone really like those endings in which, despite the combined inertia of character, plot, plausibility and logic, everything works out?  I'm not sure; probably someone does.  Grandmas go to the movies too.  But the more more important point may be that fewer people staunchly object to these endings; we know that good art ultimately makes us happy, but that doesn't mean it  is  happy.  (Perhaps the real problem is a widespread confusion of satisfaction and happiness.  I might even confuse the two as I write this.)        Just as in the past we all became armchair psychologists, now we have all become armchair Ad-men.  We think we are savvy to market forces and cynically aware of how we are manipulated.  But we still buy the same shit, and just as much of it.  Our cynicism has been acknowledged and appropriated.  It strikes me that our two choices this November are the outright consequence of this trend: a conservative who talks like a liberal, and a liberal whose supporters vote for him mostly because they're pretty sure others will as well.

       Don't Bother With The Local Girls   Count me among those who find Elvis Costello grating as often as I find him awesome.  There's just something about the guy that makes me wonder if some people would be less annoying if they had been bullied more as kids.   Maybe that's why I like  urlLink Graham Parker  so much.  He's like Costello but less clever and a lot more angry. (Apparently, Rolling Stone agrees: "Elvis Costello... sounded like a hoax that Parker and his sometime producer Nick Lowe had thought up in an inspired moment)."  I mean, could Costello pull off a convincing cover of that Jackson 5 song "I Want You Back"? I doubt it.    Particularly, I dig  urlLink Squeezing Out Sparks , featuring Brinsley Schwarz, an otherwise excellent backing band, and "You Can't Be Too Strong," probably the best song ever about abortion, alternately claimed as both pro-life and pro-choice.  But, of course, the song is better than that.  Not unlike Denis Johnson's "Dirty Wedding," the politics take a backseat to the emotional situation which, no matter which way you cut it, sucks for everyone involved.

       Members of the Evil Empire practice their death ray .&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Of course, we don't want Cheney rooting for the sox; the spanks can have him.  (Although, apparently they don't want him either.   urlLink He was booed .)  And anyone unconvinced that Lucchino was right about the evil empire comment should maybe review the evidence.  But the real point is this:  there is nothing, and I mean nothing, in this world that is surprising anymore.  That's the real tragedy of our era.  We've figured out pretty well how things work and for whatever reason we are uninterested or powerless to stop the systemic fruit of systemic labor from blossoming on the systemic tree.     Of course  Dick Cheney likes the Yankees.

      How does  urlLink Freddy Garcia going to the White Sox  affect who I will root for after I move to Chicago?  It's hard to say.  On the one hand, I kind of like Garcia.  He's a Derek Lowe-when-he's-good type of pitcher, even to the extent of being a bit of a nut.  This is my favorite sort of player, sort of a lovable loser, lovable because he helps your team win but is, you know, kind of a loser.  This kind of player is quintessentially Red Sox and his presence on the White Sox may make them more the kind of team I want to root for.  On the other hand, he should be on the Red Sox.  There was good reason to think Theo was after him and that Chicago got him for Kelly Shoppach's long lost hispanic twin, only makes me more mad.  So maybe this is a strike against the White Sox, in favor of the Cubs.  Bitches be stabbing you in the back.

      You have a habit of mischaracterizing points of view you don't agree with, Scott, and while it's mildly entertaining, so is it frustrating.  My point was not about "not being the Cubs" but about being a legitimage underdog.  In some regards, the Red Sox are to the Yankees as the White Sox are to the Cubs  (not all regards, not even many, but some).  The Cubs are quick to claim underdog status, but who is keeping them down, exactly?  It's a usurpation of sympathy and it isn't attractive.  Perhaps this is "well-tread ground" for a reason, "Scott."  But, of course, I'm not going to root for the Sox just to piss you off, however tempting it may be.  You're right: let's go to a game at each park this summer, take notes, and see what happens.

      Horrible by Scott  You're treading well-worn ground, Pete. Sox fans are basically trash, a quintessential example being  urlLink this asshole . Bauman's right to an extent, the Cubs are the big guys in Chicago. To use some yuppie-speak, At the end of the day, the best baseball to watch is at Wrigley Field (and that's the bottom line).   What I recommend to you is what my dad and I did when I was little: go to each park, watch a game, see how you identify with the fans and the atmosphere, and decide after that. Then at least you're not coming into this with the loaded contexts you seem to be lugging. I love the Cubs, that comes from years of support. So of course I'm bias. I'd like to see my buddy like my team. But don't like the Sox just because they're not the Cubs. From the looks of your arguments you're leaning in this slippery-slope direction.

      What a time to be picking between the Cubs and White Sox:  With the cross-town series set for this weekend,  urlLink Mike Bauman considers the rivalry .  A line that would seem to be in direct contradiction of Scott's assessment of the Cubs:   Life is never easy, pulling for the Sox in a Cubbie world.   Everyone wants to claim underdog status, Scott.  The Cubs remind me of megapopstars who put out singles about how their sick of being criticized.  Like, poor, poor NSYNC.  They're sick of the playa hatin'.  So many people are sympathizing not because of the wrong itself, but because they identify with the wronged party.  But if this phenomenon is widespread enough, it removes the original wrong, and makes hypocrits of everyone. Nevermind the fact that the Sox have gone almost as long as the cubs without a world series.  I know it sounds like I've made up my mind.  I haven't.  I'm just being contrary.  We'll see if it lasts.

      Bombardment by Scott  I'll say that the Red Sox and the Cubs (cultural implications we're talking now) have more in common than being "cursed." That the BoSox and the Cubs have continued to lose is an indeliable mark on their personality, and there are other factors: the neighborhoods are similar, the ballparks each have a quaint and substantial history, the beer is expensive and bad, the fans are highly disrespectful to the opponents. Fenway and Wrigley are the last monuments to a different period, a modernist ideal of classicism and form coming together to withstand the test of time and marketing. It's ridiculous that the Red Sox even be compared to any other baseball team. The White Sox live in a bright shell beside the tollway express lanes. There are gigantic pinwheels affixed to the upper deck. You can buy 10 different kinds of beer. You could also get ribs, if you are a real Postmodern baseball enthusiast. Working-class the Sox are not. Between the Cubs and the White Sox, I'd say you have to go with the Cubs because the Cubs stand up to what the Modernist wants out of baseball. Granted, the south side of Chicago is poorer than the north. The north is crammed with yuppies. But this in no way suggests that the Cubs are more haute coulture. It just fortells the story of Chicago, which is that the Cubs happen to be located within a more taxable real estate area. That the Cubs continue to play quality Modernist baseball belies the yuppie occurences in the surrounding area. Do your careful research, but I don't think two teams in baseball hold more in common in terms of personality and essence than the Cubs and the BoSox.

      It's not often that one has the luxury of choosing their allegiances.  I once met a guy who had gone from being a Quaker to a Skinhead to a Joycean to a Russian Orthodox, all within a few years.  When I met him he was still a Joycean, but was shopping for a new faith.  We discussed this quest in a New York diner.  I remember watching him pour gravy over his waffle fries and being mildly disgusted. It was difficult not to understand his eating habits as relevant to his identity crisis.    My first and only question to this pilgrim was:  What's true?  He didn't understand what I meant.  So I said, list your beliefs for me, and we'll figure out which religion is most consistent with those beliefs.      But to do it that way made no sense to him.  He was evaluating the different options on the basis of his preferences, what he would like to believe.  This didn't make sense to me; you shouldn't believe in transubstantiation because your Catholic, you should be Catholic because you believe in transubstantiation.  Especially, or perhaps only, if you are a convert rather than born into a faith.  Being born into something is admittedly arbitrary, but at least then it is intertwined with your upbringing and formative identity.  And most religions account for this arbitrariness with ceremonies such as confirmation, bar/bat-mitzvahs, various other rites of passage that parallel one's nominal development of free-will.  To convert on the basis of mere preference is a bit mercenary, if not whorish, if not the the ultimate expression of a bland consumerism.  Nonetheless, with the impending move to Chicago, I am in the position to make just such a conversion.  Raised a Red Sox fan, the disappointment, incredulity and perennial feelings of betrayal all in my veins, I am for the first time moving to a city with it's own options.  Of course, of course, of course: I am and always will be a Red Sox fan, first and foremost.  Forever.  But which team's games will I attend?  Listen to on the radio?  Discuss when drunk?  For whom will my love of the game transcend my love of the Red Sox?  Prior to a few days ago, it was a foregone conclusion that this team would be the Cubs, MLB's other cursed franchise.  But now, I'm not so sure.  The White Sox might actually be more my style, dare I say it, more Red Sox.  Alas, this is a decision that calls for careful research, consideration and counsel, and I cannot make a decision at this moment.  (Please feel free to advise me, but please don't bombard me with bullshit.  This is an intellectual exercise, not a dogmatic one, so don't act like a thug.)  Needless to say, my decision will not be made on the basis of the team's performance, but it's personality and essence.  I will not be choosing based on which team is more likely to enter the play-offs, but on which team I think can better serve as proxy for my living, once again, in Boston, surrounded by like-minded cohorts and cultural implications.    More later.

The job is at  urlLink East-West University , a small private school in the south loop primarily serving graduates of the Chicago public school system.

      Show me show me show me how you do that trick by Scott  Moore's an asshole, I'm with you there on him. Most people I know are assholes, and they bask in their righteousness as if it was a old GTO with loud pipes that they just fixed up. However, to like being righteous is what makes this "documentary" so damn incendiary and allows us the delight to react with such opposing gusto. (Hitchens included in "us.") Moore can't possibly make an "objective" movie, just as Fox can't provide us with news that doesn't include extraneous celebrity marketing (eg, Michael Moore's new movie). But people, I mean, Americans, I mean, those who believe that celebrity news is in fact news, don't want unrighteous, fact-driven objectivity. The proof's in the pudding, the fact that celebrities are even given some of the news spotlight is preposterous, bizarre, and comically rumor-mill. This isn't another whiny complaint about our SUV-driving, mocha-chuggin', Home Depot-refurnishing ethos. Our culture is divided for multiple reasons that I blame mostly on Christian fundamentalism and its subsequent entitlement beliefs. What I'm talking about, and what I genuinely like about Moore, is how similar his sensationalism is to the rest of today's mediocre "journalism,"  and yet that much more incendiary. Nobody's dogging  urlLink Bill Kurtis  for his report on 9/11, or those two Polish brothers who filmed the fireman story and "turned away" from the gruesome and inapproapriate footage. Their journalism is no less slanted than Moore's. Granted, Moore's a little more Op-Ed, a little more Orson Welles. But everybody's going after this pudgy guy from Michigan, and it's because he's the news. Really, that's it.

       Christopher Hitchens deconstructs/criticizes Michael Moore's new movie on  urlLink Slate .  He goes so far as to throw down, in perhaps the most awesome paragraph to ever appear on Slate.  I know, that's not saying a whole lot, but still:  as for [Moore's] scary lawyers—get a life, or maybe see me in court. But I offer this, to Moore and to his rapid response rabble. Any time, Michael my boy. Let's re-do Telluride. Any show. Any place. Any platform. Let's see what you're made of.  I hate Michael Moore.  He reminds me of those kids in college who would handcuff themselves to an administrator's office door and sing "we shall overcome" into the night.  Purportedly, they do this for the sake of sweatshop labor, but the unstated benefits to the participants-- socially, personally, etc-- always seemed dishonest, petty, and a bit too reminiscent of summer camp.  It worries me that some people just like being righteous and that the variety of their indignation is more or less incidental.  Like  urlLink Mitchum  in " urlLink Night of the Hunter ," but not as psychotic/murderous.

       urlLink Terry Teachout  gives advice on public readings (via  urlLink Maud Newton ).   He leaves out one important bit of advice that has salvaged (I hope) any reading I've ever done:  21)  Be slightly drunk.  It not only makes you more charming and slightly tragic, but it gets rid of so many of the inhibitions that make a lot of the above advice necessary in the first place.

      Three weeks off of knee surgery,  urlLink Bill Mueller maybe ready to hit , but he isn't ready to construct metaphors:   "They took out a nice piece of crab meat out of there and some spinach dip and painted a nice picture in there," Mueller quipped of the arthroscopic procedure which took place three weeks ago. "Everything's good. Real good."   What the fuck, Bill?  That's gross, unnecessary, and it doesn't really make sense.  Sometimes, I think that baseball players are dadaist poets working in a strange vernacular, and sometimes I just think they're stupid.  I don't know what that says more about: me, baseball players, or dadaist poetry.  And it's not just the players, either.  Gammo's columns remind me of reading a note in illegible handwriting; any sense I make of it is contextual as much as it is present in the writing itself.

       Mission Accomplished   A while back,  urlLink I announced my quest to find and read a genre-novel of solid literary merit .  The good news is, I've found it.  I've read it.  The bad news is that it is over 1200 pages long, 150 years old, French, and, well, a book most of us have lived our lives comfortably avoiding.  It's a book we all know of and can perhaps summarize, a novel our parents generation read much more widely, a book that will likely not excite you no matter what I say about it.  Still, in an effort to convince, consider the following passage on the Divine Justice:   I too have been carried up by Satan to the highest mountain on earth.  Once there he showed me the whole world and, as he did to Christ, said to me "Now, Son of Man, what do you want if you are to worship me?"  So I thought for a long time, because in reality a terrible ambition had long been devouring my soul.  Then I answered him: "Listen, I have always heard speak of Providence, yet I have never seen her or anything that resembled her, which makes me think that she does not exist.  I want to be Providence, because the thing I know which is finist, greatest and most sublime in this world is to reward and to punish."  But Satan bowed his head and sighed.  "You are wrong," he said.  "Providence does exist, but you cannot see her, because, as the daughter of God, she is invisible like her father.  You have seen nothing that resembles her because she proceeds by hidden means and walks down dark paths.  All that I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of this Providence."  The deal was concluded.  I shall perhaps lose my soul, but what matter?  If the deal had to be struck over again, I should do it.   If that isn't awesome enough for you, consider this description of a poisoner watching her victim die in her sleep:   She withdrew with such care that it was evident that she was afraid of the sound of her own feet on the carpet; yet, even as she went she still kept the curtain lifted, taking in the scene of death, which exercises an irresistable attraction when death is not decomposition but only immobility and, so long as it remains a mystery, does not yet inspire disgust.   There's a lot of other great passages, including a wonderful discussion of hashish followed by an equally wonderful description of its effects, but I'm getting sick of typing and I suspect you are getting sick of reading.   I'm quoting, of course, from  urlLink The Count of Monte Cristo .

      And while I'm discussing my trip (and I will stop), the most disgusting trend I saw in both Hungary and Poland was a preponderance of Yankee hats.  I was reminded of all those skinheads I used to know who wore  urlLink Arsenal jerseys , not because they were really fans of that particular team, but because an investment in English Football was central to their self-image and they were too lazy, as a culture it seems, to bother to learn about anything but the most popular and successful team.  I imagine that Yankees hats in eastern Europe function similarly; as an easy symbol of one's interest in the poetically fecund and, of course, quintessentially American, game of baseball.  And I can forgive them this.  I'd prefer that they (think they) like the Yankees than that they not like baseball at all, and I realize that there may be questions of access here.  But really: does anyone really need further evidence of the Evil Empire?

      I was sitting outside at a Krakow cafe last week when the three women at the next table became upset.  They put their hands to their faces, one blushed, and another jumped from her chair and sprinted to catch up with a man who had passed by on the sidewalk.   He looked like a cross between Brad Pitt and that guy from  urlLink Nickelback .  The man, quite friendly, submitted to her pleas and returned with her to her friends.      To this point, I assumed that he was an exciting and perhaps long lost acquaintance.  The scene was interesting from a simple and dramatic viewpoint.  But then he was signing autographs and speaking to the women in polish.  One woman posed with him in front of another's camera-phone.  A bum, also recognizing the star, lurked patiently outside the cafe to ask for change.  And this guy, what a guy, obliged instantly.  Another detail that remains, for whatever reason, is the crumpled McDonalds back in his hand.  It seemed so mundane for a guy in leather pants, let alone a celebrity.  What's most notable about this celebrity encounter is that I was able to observe it with no recognition at all of the celebrity himself.  I had no reason to be excited by seeing him in person, so my attention was focused more on the women as much as him.  I've spotted and/or met a few celebrities in my life, and they've always disappointed me in person; physically, personally, sometimes both.  But this guy, in some paradoxical way, might as well have been Elvis back from the dead.  I felt compelled to ask for his autograph too, but decided that the possibility of him  figuring my ignorance would dash the whole point.

      Iraq and Spidey By Scott  June 30th, the day that the interim Iraqi government assumes sovereignty, also happens to be opening day for the blockbuster Spiderman 2. Will a Michael Chabon-written screenplay make more millions than Iraq's gluttonous oil fields? It remains to be seen. However, know this: Spidey is for  urlLink justice . What I find ironic is that Spidey is now more American than ever.  I'm sure most Impeccable readers know about the cross-promotional deal Spidey has with Major League baseball. Clips of the movie on scoreboards, Spidey foam finger merchandise at souvenir shops, images of Spidey on the bases at Fenway. Surely the Dirt Dogs can't have a part in this as well. Say it ain't so, Johnny Caveman! Say that dirty advertising money used trying to convert Muslims isn't in your pocket! But it's true.     Iowans and Hoosiers take note, today's a special day in Chicago history: On this day in 1981, Dan Goodwin dons a home-made Spiderman costume, grabs a couple suction cups, and climbs the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower. It takes Goodwin six hours to perform the stunt, which remains, to this day, the coolest thing ever done by a human being. Goodwin was later arrested for public endangerment. He went to jail in his tights, spent the night with the riffraff, paid 1000 dollars bail in the morning, and was never heard from again. Then, in the summer of 1999, some  urlLink wacky Frenchman  tried his hand at it.

       Nomar's Back and So Am I   After 25 hours of traveling, I am back in the states.  I'm not home yet, however, so normal posting probably won't resume until Monday.    I don't want to bore anyone with a self-indulgent travelogue, but I will say this:  Poland rocks.  Krakow, in particular, rocks.  I have never loved a city so fully so quickly.  Few cities manage to be both so vibrant and historical, so youthful and venerable all at once.  And man, the pierogies will knock your socks off.  I would live there if they'd have me.  As if in honor of my return, Reagan is dead and Nomar is back.  Not to speak ill of the dead, of course, (rather, only to intimate it via euphemism), but famous people I don't like tend to die when I'm on vacation.  Could I, perhaps, be the center of the universe?  Such proof is, of course, both scant and strange.  It's amazing, the patterns that cohere over the span of comprehensive chaos.  Monkeys, typewriters, Shakespeare, sure, but it's even more interesting when the pattern is wholly original and still recognizable.  After two weeks in the hearth of Catholicism, two weeks of skull decorated chapels, immense cathedrals, saintly relics, scale mail and Auschwitz, meaning seems a little more meaningful.  Perhaps, once my photographs are in order, I'll do a photo-essay on this Polish Death Trip.  Death is holy, and my place in the universe feels a little more secure for all the pondering I have done recently of this immense and singular truth (Like I was saying before I left: one layer of meaning, thick as an iceberg, is preferable to multitudes of overlapping but waifer thin meanings.)    A welcome is perhaps in order to anyone here for the first time in the past few days, thanks to Nathalie Chicha's impeccable plug.  What a gal. Welcome.  Please stick around.  And thanks again to Scott for minding the place while I was gone.  Links, coherence on Monday.  It's good to be back.

      Muses By Scott  In between thinking who is the best rapper/actor, I began to think about muses. Maybe because Tupac is in fact the best, and Janet Jackson is his muse in "Poetic Justice." However, Mos Def recently played a heart surgeon for an HBO movie, and was very good. And how about Ice-T in Law and Order? I don't count the rapper/actor/comedians, such as Snoop and Method Man / Redman; or the rapper/actor/action stars, such as DMX. Yes, Tupac is the winner.   While searching for muses using the internet, I found  urlLink this , which is good i guess.

      Unsafe at any speed by Scott  One Impeccable reader's comments on my rip into professional auto racing really got me thinking about the sport, the fans, the ethos. Perhaps, I thought, I am not taking the time necessary to really understand the race, the "other." Maybe it isn't just one extended left turn, I thought. And in attempting to understand, I found  urlLink this , which was, for me, a watershed of the contemporary mores.

      Bueller by Scott  Today is one of those days in Chicago that come maybe once a summer. Most of my day is being spent here, in the park, with an AirPort. I recommend these yuppie devices. I've been thinking about Law & Order and how McCoy and the gang always try to blow the lid off of some travesty not getting enough press: online gambling, crooked adoptions (also online), small cameras placed strategically in Starbucks bathrooms. Like anyone, I am in love with Law & Order, but I see it approaching a crisis when it grabs "stories from the headlines." I do not want to be influenced by McCoy's stubborn jurisprudence. When McCoy impedes on reality, the future gets manipulated, since L&O works in an hour form, whereas the real case won't be judged for months, years. But this nonsense won't stop L&O from making an episode out of someone killing a dude who grabbed a foul ball and caused his baseball team to lose. I don't like when fiction "gets a boost" from the shit that's supposed to be stranger than it.   On another topic: Here, read a snippet of a real good essay by  urlLink my boss .

      Does anyone give a shit about the Indy 500 by Scott  Maybe in Europe, due to the amount of money put into speed by the automakers there.  I actually have been to a 500 mile formula one race at Nap Town's Motor Speedway. I went in college and was bored to the last second. I couldn't even get beer because i was 20 years old. Every thirty seconds or so, for 500 laps, the cars zoom by while people yell and spill their beer on each other. I'd liken it to 50 thousand people watching as someone tries to get an busted Nintendo to function.  NASCAR, as a result of its puzzling popularity in the tailgatin' South, has taken over most of the television rights and ad sponsorships of professional racing, which the Indy used to dominate. I'm not saying boo-hoo, I just wonder, culturally I mean, how certain sports fall out of the popular opinion. Like, say, no one ever gave a fuck about the America's Cup, but I can remember a time when I would get excited about seeing a professional heavyweight boxing fight. Now heavyweight boxing has disappeared in the American sports lexicon. There's no more "Watch out for Mike Tyson!" or "Look at old George Foreman fight!"

      Everyday is silent and grey by Scott  This Sunday I went to check up on Morrisey, the little baby orangutan whose birth I witnessed. He's doing great, and has already learned to use leafy branches as fly swatters. Morrisey was only out in the morning, then he was snatched up by a zookeeper and put somewhere else. Apparently his name is 'Cuckoo." I found this to be revolting, or simply the product of some dumb kid winning the naming contest. Lest I forget, zoos are for kids, not twenty six year olds with an unhinged social contract. Anyway here's some  urlLink more stuff .

      Pete and I have taken a break from writing, mostly because all we do now is correspond to each other with new and improved band names, some better than our previous ones. Perhaps we should set up a web site selling cool, highly literate band names to hapless musicians. We could charge 1 USD for mawkish yet still reliable names, like The Cutters, Bristol City, or Quick Kick; then up the ante to as much as 20 USD for supercharged and brand-ready names, like The Drop Shadows, Screwtape, and The Away Jerseys. We'd keep the middle-of-the-road-names, still guaranteed to pique the curiousity of hipsters but not promise them anything, hovering around 10 USD, names like Stately Plump and Shipwreck. Pete and I would make a killing. It's a buyer's market.   I should give a link. Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings (his fan moniker "KenJen") has only two more days to go before Jeopardy shuts down for the season, and the show's producers have to decide to bring him back as a returning champ next season, since he hasn't been beaten yet. He's won like 34 days in a row, and has been basically untouchable. I caught one episode where he closed out three straight categories. Plus, he's Mormon. There have been many responses to KenJen's wrath, but i like  urlLink the drinking games .

      There's a real-life Tarzan/Romulus/Remus.  Sort of.  He was  urlLink raised by chickens  (Via  urlLink Fark ).  I really want this to be cool, but I just feel bad for the guy.  The only thing lamer than being raised by chickens is... I don't know.  It's pretty much entirely uncool.  Even pigeons would be better.  Anything.   And  he is an orphan  and  this is all the result of blatant abuse (As opposed to, say, high adventure).  What a drag.

      You know, it really pays off to read  urlLink Norwegian news .     Cumshot provided the background music as the couple had intercourse right in front of the audience. A banner was raised on stage informing the audience that the couple was having sex to save the rainforest. After completing the intercourse, the couple received applause from the audience and disappeared.

      With the impending vote on gay marriage in Congress, some activists are calling for the  urlLink forced outing  of politicians and their staffs.  This issue is tricky.  On the one hand, as Barney Frank puts it, no one has "the right to hypocrisy."  On the other hand, Wonkette makes a good point: "being a gay Republican -- Wow! Your own private hell! -- must be torture enough."    I guess the heart of the issue is the right to privacy, particularly on matters that can, unfortunately, be held against an individual in very real ways.  There's a grim irony to a forced outing; the closeted individual is shamed by the very people who claim he should not be ashamed.    All this seems particularly relevant after watching Law & Order:SVU last night.  This week's current affairs episode dealth with "the DL," or, the practice among some black men of secretly having sex with other men while maintaining their heterosexuality.  My initial reaction was, "Okay, Dick Wolf.  I read that article in NYT magazine too," but then Ice-T delivered a supremely entertaining speech on modern black sexuality and gender-norms, deftly triagulating James Baldwin, Camille Paglia and every health video I ever sat through my freshman year of high school.  God, I love Ice-T.  Anyone who can call themself a Nietzchean superman and never be questioned for it is one cool dude.

      &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Irony.  I've bitched about it before.  So many of us seem to have forgotten what it means and use it to legitimize apathy, dishonesty, laziness and bad fiction.  What's so interesting about saying the exact opposite of what you mean?  What's so great about quotation marks anyway?    And hey:  what's so ironic about a chimp wearing terry cloth and pointing a pistol?  If chimps were regularly murdered with pistols, perhaps this might approach irony.  Like my college roommate used to say:  "Rain on your wedding day isn't ironic unless your the greek god of sunny weddings.  Otherwise, it just sucks."  But I don't want to overstate the case, either:  A gun toting chimp is pretty goddamn funny.    So why can't it just be that?  I wholeheartedly enjoy the above photograph, without a trace of a smirk.  You got a "problem" with that, "Punk"?

      As many of you know, there is a pretend band waiting for me in Chicago, consisting of our own  urlLink Scott ,  urlLink Mike Loudmouth  from the once great, now defunct  urlLink Loudmouth Rockies (Caution, link is LOUD),  and Nice Guy Paul, probably best known for his modelling work but also  urlLink a photographer in his own right .  When I was in town last week the four of us grilled some meat and did what pretend bands do best:  we tried to come up with a name.  Two hour of hard thought yielded two possibilities acceptable to all of us:   urlLink Where Eagles   urlLink Daryl  and  urlLink Kuato .  (I am alone in preferring the former.  Something about paying tribute to a slimy psychic man-baby who lives on some dude's chest feels wrong.)  Since then I have come up with a few names I think are better:   Bristol City (Cockney rhyming slang...) The War Presidents The Stupid Club  And, a name that would be more punk rock, alas, than I am:  The Wife Killers (I just can't do it.  But if any troop of fuck the world 19 year olds want it, they can have it with my blessing.)   I'd like to acknowledge the inspiration I found for a few of these in  urlLink Schott's Miscellany ,an essential resource for any pretend band.

      Funny how  urlLink labor laws can be called blue laws and no one thinks twice .   True, the laws in question were legislated in a religious context, but the idea that 24 consecutive hours off is an  outdated  benefit scares me a bit.  The connotation is clear: such laws make no more sense than the ones that keep liquor stores closed on Sundays or make adultery a punishable crime.    My favorite part of the article:   Pam Reynolds, manager of Reynolds Funeral Service in Waynesboro, said the laws would seriously impact her business.   "I can't imagine how we would do that," she said. "People die seven days a week. We respond in shifts. If we get a call, we have to go."    And you know what, Pam?  People have always died that way.

      There's rumors on SOSH of a ridiculous trade:  1)  Blue Jays get Cesar Izturis and ml pitcher (Jackson?) 2)  Dodgers get Nomar and Kim 3)  Red Sox get Odalis Perez and Carlos Delgado  Ridiculous.  But if it happened, it might counteract the soul-crushing extra-innings loss to the Yankees last night.   (God- what a fucking game.  I've been trying to get past this whole "yankee hatin'" thing, but I realized last night that hating the yankees, loving the red sox, you can't  really  do one without doing the other.  That said, I felt sympathy for Derek Jeter for the first time ever.  But I still hope his dog dies.)  Anyway, as for the trade, I think I'm with SOSH poster Romero Romine:   The way this season is going, they'll announce the trade pending medical exams, Delgado will pass the exam; then, during the press conference sealing the deal, the creature from Alien will leap out from Delgado's sternum, killing all Sox players save Kevin Millar and leaving the writers.

       Revolution Rock   An expanded London Calling-- including an extra disc of demos AND a DVD-- will be  urlLink available  on September 21.  Needless to say, I'll be buying this.  I'm not generally a fan of such superlatives, but no album hit me at a more formative moment in life or mattered more than London Calling did.  I don't listen to it often anymore, but when I do, its a combination of nostalgia and that zen-like meditation that one can slip into listening to music that is intimately, and perhaps unconsciously, familiar.    But I also plan to be disappointed.  Interest in the Clash has spiked in the past five years.  But with the exception of Joe Strummer's  urlLink last album , this interest has yielded nothing but a  urlLink load   urlLink of   urlLink crap .  I know because I've bought every bit of it, full of hope and faith, only to end up very disappointed.  And pissed off.

      about reliable internet access?  I lied.  The most frustrating part is that I know no one is reading this.  I haven't posted regularly for almost a month now and I don't blame you people for abandoning me.  But, just in case anyone is still reading, please participate in my letter campaign against SBC.  (Some of you may remember them as Ameritech.  And guess what?  They're still assholes.)  Cut and paste the following text into an email to those pig fuckers and insert your name at the end.  Make sure you use  your  name.  And please include your ss# so that they know I'm not just spamming them.    Dear Pig Fuckers,  Because you refuse to repair the outage of your registration server for Chicago, IL., I am unable to read my favorite blog, Impeccable Jones.   This laziness on your pig-fucking part is most troubling.  Because when you fuck with Impeccable Jones, you fuck with the Impeccable Army.  Unless you fix the problem within twenty-four hours, I will personally come to the home of each and every one of your IT geeks with a fifty pound magnet and a sledge hammer.  How I will accomplish this is not for you to know.  I am the Santa Claus of vengeance, bitch. I will wiggle down your chimneys and I will fuck you up.  Best,  [Your Name Here] [Your Social Security # Here]

      Finally, reliable internet access.  I should be back for good now.  Big things are afoot in the world of impeccable jones. Between Barrack Obama and a sweaty John Kerry, between Nomar's sudden revelation as one of baseball's biggest bums, a new home in a new town, and a visit to Boston, Philly and New Jersey, there has been plenty to write about but no internet to write it on. Sorry about that.  Scott and I have been discussing this nomar thing in an analog format, though, and there are some important points to be made.  Count me among the supporters of this trade.  Scott seems to insist that I be upset about it,  but considering Nomar's actions, the players available and all other factors, I think the Sox did the best thing for the team.   Cabrera and Mientkiewicz are solid players who aren't going to fake injuries, make ridiculous salary demands, or infect the clubhouse with their sulking.  No, they won't hit as many home runs as Nomar will, but we have enough of those guys in this line up.  The vastly improved defense will save us runs, and I'm personally tired of rooting for a team that either socks eight home runs and wins, or doesn't and loses.   Historically speaking, the trade is a move in the right direction, toward building a solid team full of solid players and away from the team's tendency to focus on and cater to it's minority of superstars.  This is a move toward a team like the 2001 Diamondbacks, the 2002 Angels, the Yankees of the 1990s.  Because the superstar lineup only works if you're willing to pay for it, and the Red Sox never quite have been.   If I have any complaints, they're minor:  1)  For my own reasons, I wish they hadn't traded Nomar to Chicago.  This effectively settles the cubs/white sox question.  I can't, in good faith, root for Nomar's new pinstripes.  Then again, the White Sox are in direct competition with the Red Sox for the wild card, so I can't exactly root for them either.   I know it isn't a satisfaction conclusion to the ongoing quandary, but I think I hate both teams, at least for now.  2)  Why didn't Theo accept the Lowe for Clement portion of the deal?  I don't see how this would have been anything but a straight upgrade.  The best justification I can think of is that Lowe will improve with the defense and the apparent vote of confidence.  I'll be the first to call Theo a genius if Lowe pitches us to the World Series, and then promptly holds Nomar to three straight double play grounders.  The long and the short of it is that I still trust Theo enough that when he does something I don't agree with, I allow for the strong possibility that he knows something I don't.  I guess we'll see.
