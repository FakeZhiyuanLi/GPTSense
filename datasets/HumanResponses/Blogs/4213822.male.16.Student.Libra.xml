      today is me last day at this bag a shite workplace.hahaha.i hope no-one from work actually visits this place otherwise il be in some shit.hahaha.no more pointless photocopying or "documentation"as that prick ian would say.its been a reet crack wi ash, terry, malc, gemma, pete and fitters but part from that bollocks really.money for nothing though which has bin fair shit hot.hahaha.i do wish that people would txt me and mail me more while i was at work cos it brightened up me day but anyway, iv finished now so who gives a shit.kirkham on monday, i know i go on about it but its gonna be so shit hot, you dont even know.training everyday and school abit and posh, dirty girls(sorry but it had to be said).you should know by now that me history of girls has bin reet shit, i dont know if theres something wrong wi me or if its the girls i like. i liike girly girls , proper girls not them chaps with the wrong reproductive organs that most are today.pink and fluffy and chocolate and nice voices and nice hair and all the right aspects of girlyness. they are girls aren't they? they should be girly, the exact opposite of me. there not naughty minded and dont enjoy getting muddy and dont laugh when they get a crack in the face and glow up when their happy, ones where you can smell the girlyness and the "aura" of femininity surrounds them.ones who have soft skin and love cuddling and are girls!sorry to go on but i feel so much about this and it hurts most of the time to know that im missing out on them, they're a dying breed and iv got to celebrate them. x
