      everybody's happy for me meeting this guy (16 year old, btw, his name's  Pawel). and they keep their fingers crossed. i do, too...  oh, all day 2day i'm trying to talk with someone on msn, and - funny  thing - everyone is offline! what's going on? it's tuesday? or it's too  early???  i think i have some problems with this blog... the messages should  appear quickly but they don't i have to wait... sooo long... don't  understand that...  i think pawel couldn't meet me sooner coz he went to czech rep. why do i  think so? i was trying to give him a shot (by mobile :)) and he was not  available. he's not available since yesterday.  kalina wrote me she's seen "the village" and the movie is LOL. even  ROTFL. stupid and all that. but she said "girl with a pearl earring" is  awesome. i should see it. and maybe i will. heh, and i'll go to the  cinema with my father as usual, coz there's no1 who would like to go  with me. and there's another good site of it - dad's paying... ;)  i'm going to my granny at a moment and she promissed to give me some  money for birthday. and i want to buy myself shoes. maybe tomorrow.  they're sooo cute! trainers with a high bootleg. black. sooo cute! i'm  gonna wear them on 31.08! and probably a skirt. it's gonna look great.  and i have to figure out which blouse would look best. i still have no  idea! well... i panic... but this date is next week! wonder how to tell  it to sara... i'm meeting this girl every day. and i won't meet her in  the last day of holidays... hmmm...

      yeah... i'm going to have a date! oh, i feel confused... what am i gonna  wear? i'm thinking only about the blouse, coz i think i'm gonna wear a  knee-lenght jeans skirt, trainers and a blouse... which blouse...  tthis guy yesterday... he was... weird (i'm overusing this word, i  think). no, he wasn't but for me - he was a bit too old. we've been  talking about my school coz he was going there once.  i've just recieven a message: those are 4 ladybirds @@@@ send them to 4  nice ppl so in 4 days your dream will come true. if u won't next 4 years  will be poor for you. you can't send it to sender :P i'm not so good in translating... :P but i've sent those messages... why? i'm stupid, but maybe my dream will  come true?

      oh, yeah, i was trying to do sth with this blog whole day so u can see  what i've written. what's happened... and now - it's on it's place.  i'm so excited about this meeting. i don't really know if i still want  victor... yeah, i was always like that. u can make me fall in love with  u very easy - u just have to tell me a few nice words, and i'm yours.  i've been infatuated so many times... just to let u know - this school  year there was 5 boys that i fell in love with. and they didn't know  about it. well, yeah, they did, but it was like feeling that i'd like  somethin... and all that... and there was no respond. and they were  moving away from me a bit. but now everythin's ok. my kove is gone and i  can talk with them (if i know them :)) freely.  i want 31.08 to be tomorrow.  i've been to the powerstation again. and it was lousy... i hate going in  there and listening how the guy who's running it talks about sex all the  time. and he's so... big. he's not fat, but he's big. a lot of muscles.  an old muscled man. and he's eating almost only chocolate. i'd like to  eat that too... i want chocolate. i need it to live... but i have to admit that i look a bit better now. i hope to look great  next tuesday... oh my god. what am i gonna wear ?!  i'm probably going to the disco on friday. and sara wants to take gosia  with us. who is gosia? i've been going with her on private english lessons for 4  years now. last year gosia met sara and sara teached her to smoke, and  now gosia is smoking. i didn't want it. coz smoking is bad. bad indeed.  and sara doesn't like gosia. why? gosia thinks sara's the best, but  she's not! and she knows that. but she shows sara like she was a goddess  or something. she says everything what sara has is great. everything  what sara says is saint. she thinks everything what sara wears is  beautiful... tortures for a person who listens to it. oh, and gosia  doesn't say that directly like i've said that. she always agrees with  sara... it's tortures indeed.  fuck epidemy or sth. sb's just started chatting with me on gg. he's 24  and he's looking for a girlfriend in the net coz his friend has met one  like that. poor guy, wonder how does he look like... he wants to know if  i ever had somebody... yeah, lying - that's the shit... i've never had a normal bf. always all by myself... and now coz of this  gg i'm meeting some boys... and i'm gonna meet one next week... :D he's talking without sense... don't know what to say sometimes... boy  is... weird. it looks like he wants to ask me out... we'll see...

      i don't know what's going on nowdays...  we have here an internet comunicator called "gg", which has a function  of looking for new contacts. i don't know if msn has sth like that... so today a boy has found me by this comunicator. he told me he lives not  far away and we are going to meet! next week - 31.08, on the railway  station :) at 11am. i can't wait. he said he's 16 (year younger), 1.85m  tall... seems cute. i'm a bit affraid about that. i don't know who is he... well... i'm not  affraid of being raped (by a 16 years old boy?) but who is he and all  that... sara's going to laugh. but i don't care. i suppose i won't tell  her about it. oh, the boy seems cute. and he asked me if i like roses... mmm... sweet.  it looks like he's gonna give me a rose! looks like first rose from a  boy in all my life. oh, and i'll meet him in a week!!! too long. this date reminds me i'll have to go to school next day, with a banana  on my face (meaning - grinning like stupid)... and i'll probably meet a  lot of friends in the city - last day of summer holidays...  oh, i don't want to go to school... seeing those faces again... learning  again...  i have braces. and those braces had made me look like Cristiano. i have  this space between 1st and 2nd teeth on the left side... yeah, he's  getting them fixed when i have "hole in progress"...  i hate talking with those stupid girls from ronaldo's groups. they can't  say a thing. only "ok..", "k..", "lol", etc. u r trying to tell them sth  important. and they are only saying... (look above)... ppl, if u want -  add me to your msn! i can't stand those girls. especialy those from  norway... free me!

      first thing in the morning - check mails. and most of the mails are from  cristiano's group. it sounds terrifying... i have only two friends that  i'm writing mails to at the moment: my class mate - judyta (alias jedi),  and kalina - girl who i've met on a windsurfing camp two years ago.  they're realy great. but... i'd like to recieve more... new school year starts in next week, so i can't sit in front of the  computer all the time (as i'm doing now).  yeah, it may be an advertisement, but i'll write it here... i've  recieved a mail about "penpal". you can multiply your money. you only  have to have :) Å3... it's not much. so i wanted to check it out... when  i've seen my type of credit card (visa electron) in the main page my  heard grew. but there was sth about choosing your country... and i  couln't find my country there. it's so cruel. why? i thought that maybe  sarah freder's horoscope was ok, and i'll recieve some money... but  that's my bad luck. yeah. bad luck.  :( victor didn't say a thing yesterday so i went to sleep. whatever.  when he'll feel like wanting to talk, i'm usualy online :P  it's very nice weather today. sun is shinning, only a few clouds in the  sky... he's probably on the swimming pool. i won't go there coz: i don't  have money and i won't go alone. judyta won't go, coz she's meeting her  bf today... :\ and all the rest of my friends are far away. on holidays.  and i have to live with my mother... i can't look at her coz she's  saying "what?!". she's trying our house to be clean and everything, but  when you enter my kitchen you can smell some mould :S i got used to it,  but my bro is trying not to enter this room :D  oh god... i have to go to this powierstation today. again. and i don't  want to... :( but i feel i'm thiner! this training really works! what  scares me that i don't have breasts because of that. i thought they're  gonna grow some more, but i started going to thin powerstation thing and  i have no breasts at the moment. feel like a boy.... :'(  i'm killing another bee in the empty bottle. it's the 3rd! hehe! :P

      have u noticed kow many ppl have blogs? i didn't suppose as many! it's weird. how many ppl need to say something to nobody and everybody.  while writing a blog you admit u have no friends. well,  it's not as  great friend that you can tell her/him everything. ppl write coz all of  them are lonely. don't know what to do with their life or have a message  to all. what about me, u can ask. i'm writing coz i don't have a friend and  because i like being a philisopher. and nobody wants to listen what i  want to say... but watching those blogs (not every1, but some of them) mine looks like  a diary. and it supposed to be a diary, right? i don't know but i'll  continue my work on it.  victor haven't yet said a thing...

      ohhhhhhh... victor is online, but i think he doesn't want to talk...  wrrr...  i've just changed my profile a little and saw that i'm still 16. it's a  bit more than 2 weeks to my birhthday, but i feel like 17 since 1.01.2004. it's always like that. you want to be older when you're as young as i  am. and then, when you r of age, you start thinking how nice was having  16 years... everyone tell me that.  oh, I'll kill him at a moment!!! why isn't he responding?  i've just downloaded "satisfaction" benny benassi's. this song is techno  but i have a few memories connected with this song. like sittin in the  park and david said he's been on a wedding and there was maaaany old  ppl. and he came to the dj and asked him for this song. all those old  ppl 've gone to dance. it was fun for sure... i remember him talking  about that, he's been so taken in, that he almost tripped by a leg of  another guy... or how me and my friends had a great fun while being on  the disco when the dj played this song loads of times!  and this... don't want to use unpretty :) words here... is still not  responding. i've closed the window of discussion. it wasn't easy... only  2 persons from my msn are online: a girl who is "away from the  computer", and victor.  2 of 35... i don't know more than a half! i  haven't even talked to them! i've just added them because I have msn for  a few weeks. not long. and i wanted to add ppl. so i've taken those  addyies from cristiano's groups... :P i know, i'm stupid.  mmm... mom has just came and gave me a cake made by her friend... mmm...  it's not so bad. i prefer my grandmothrs apple pie, but this one is ok.  oh, i'd like to smoke now... yeah, i'm smoking. i like smoking, but not  too much. sometimes i have to make a break coz my lungs are filled. and  i have no problem with that. especially when i don't have money. i'm  smoking about 3 years now. kinda long time, but i'm not IN it, if u know  what i mean. don't know how to say it. i'm not a chain smoker who can't  stop smoking. i'm just little smoker...  wrrrrr.... why isn't he saying a thing? why? wrrrr....

      my life is not fun. i realy can't find myself in it. just like any young  girl. when u r 17, u hate life. everything isn't going your way. all the  time there are some things that can change your life in hell.  e.x. when i was about 8, i thripped while skating. i tripped so bad that  my front tooth has fallen out and on saturday i had to find a dentist  who will put it into my gums. it has been broken so it was rather short.  i had to smile with a shorter front tooth for 8 long years. it wasn't  really nice. especialy in the moments when ppl in my school shouted  "hey, girl without front tooth". it wasn't nice. neither fun. but i've  survived and i'm stronger now. because of that stupid thing i wanted to  kill myself. but i was young. and my friends were young too so they...  they were different. i can say whatever i want now. i'm not meeting them  now. they are not my friends... i've learned to live with a feeling that i'm not perfect. that i don't  have much friends. that my life won't be happy and great. yeah, i have  plans for future. i want to earn a lot of money. be independent and all  that. but i don't know how will it look like... it's a mystery. maybe  i'll die tomorrow? who knows? i'm trying to be realistic. i don't have  any big dreams for the future. i'm trying to get what life gives me. but  i'm lazy so i'm not fighting for anything... maybe that's why i'm  unhappy and have no luck. and i'm ugly of course... oh... i can't post any pics here because of that stupid linux. i'll  figure out sth... maybe some gallery on other page... i'll think about  that...

      yes. my brother is ok. i like chats with him. he's that unique person  who knows what i think about my family. all those problems with money,  mother, father... only he knows how much i want to het out of this small  city which gives me no prospects for further life. yeah... i love my  brother.  i've been in the mountains today. with my dad and his gf. it was a nice  trip. not too high mountains are ok. but i hate going there. but i's  starting being used to anna (dad's gf). i can feel she likes me. she  liked me even when i showed her that i don't like her. yeah, it was  cruel, but... i felt lonely. like i was loosing my father. and my dad is  a person who i care about the most. that's why i'm still alive (i wanted  to kill myself, but now i know it's a bad choice). and there was this  crash. and i was confused... but now i like her.  i'm going off again... i'm sittin in the net to talk with victor (this  young guy:) ) and he's offline. hope to talk to him today... i realy don't know what for i'm doing this. i don't want him to know me.  why? he's a realy cute guy, who had a lot of gfs, he's playing football  in a club, and all that... i'm not a girl that he'd like to be with. i'm  sure. yeah, i feel that i could do sth, but... i also know that  nothing's gonna happen. as usual.  i've just been talking with a girl who said she's been hounted. it's  sooo weird. i didn't belive in such things. oh, yeah, i belived, but  just like ppl who belive in ufo. they belive and all that but we'll see  what they'll do when they'll meet one. and she says that i should visit  her in the us to see that... i'd freak out, i think...  oh... why isn't he writing!!!

      i'm very happy nowdays! the boy wrote me (meaning - we've had a little  chat). i've found a fabulous girl that i can talk with about everything.  i feel so happy!  there's another story in my mind... some time ago, while surfing in the  net, i've found "horoscope - absolutely free". so i put my name in there  and the date of birth. i was born in 1987, but there was no such year to  pick, so i've chosen 1985. the woman wrote me after 2 days that my life  is gonna change for better. i'm gonna have loads of money, my life will  be full of happiness and luck. yeah - i thought - really? but it seems  that everything's going my way now. we'll see... it's just a beginning...  and ronaldo has played yesterday. he didn't score, but he play, so i  have 4 new pics of him :)))

      well, i wanted to save it for another post. hope my best friend won't  see that.  sara is my best friend. we know each other for 4 years now and there is  nothing i can hate more. so... why I'm calling her my best friend? haha!  she's the person who knows too many things about me. and i know a bit  too many things about her... :P she remembers the moment we met for the first time, i don't: i came to  her while going back home on the first day of school (i had to pass by  her house while going to mine) and asked: "are we going to the same  class?" and that's how it started... we started meeting every day and  that's how it is bow. we're no longer going to the same school, but we  are still meeting every day :)  I and she are complete adversities. she's wearing pink, i'm wearing  black. she's short, i'm tall. she's got long blonde (dyed) hair, i have  short rather dark (my colour) hair. and i can see the problem in it,  that she can have every male she wants to. she can't even dance. looks  like an elephant has stepped on her ear... :P she's being fucked by a 42 years old guy who's a friend of sara's mother  all sara's life. weird girl. but somehow i like her.  she came back from holidays a week ago and said she's been fucked by the    tutor (if i can call him that; he wasn't a teacher, just taked care of  the children:) just because she liked his clothes and a fact he's  bisexual... yeah, told ya she's weird...  i hate her for this. she can't be as great to be liked by every male...  she's not even as pretty... she likes alcohol a lot. she's not having  fun without it. in feb she's tried a pill, and she liked it as much that  when we went to the disco and she couldn't get herself one she sat on a  bench and didn't dance for all night. she's ruined my night. i remember  going everywhere that day and singing: "cosmos tonight!" cosmos is a  name of our disco.  sara's now at hers sister... far away... coming back on tue. and i don't  know what to do with myself. she's such a big part of my life, that i  don't know what to do without her. i don't even have such friends that  will go to the city with me whenever sara's somewhere else...  what to do with her???  i need a man...

      oh... i'm so pissed! i've found a guy in some "memberships' collection".    i added him to my msn and wanted 2 talk. but guy doesn't want to talk,  i think. he's closin the window whenever i'm talkin to him... well...  this guy who i wanted to talk with, this 2 years younger, is not  responding. and i don't care. he's too young. wrr... i'm talkin like that every time i want to leave sth, even if i  still want it. it's annoying... but what can u say about a life of a 17  year old girl which isn't really cute to be with some1...  yeah, i've always had problems with having a boufriend. and i've never  had one... don't know why. maybe i'm too shy? dunno. really... yeah...  I'm young. and i can find somebody. but i don't know if i even want to.  it's a great responsibility. oh, i mean, u have to go out with him and  all that... call, and do things... u have to have some time for that  which i haven't got. but there are some good sides of having a bf.  kissing for example... oh... it's great... and I can't have it... for now :)

      so, I can say that my blog is actualy started since this day...  I need a man. this is the thing that bothers me the most in my life, so  that's what u can read here about. men.  I've sent a message to a boy (why I'm calling him a boy? he's 2 years  younger...) with my comunicator number. I want this boy so badly that  I'm even dreaming about him. and he's not responding...  somewhere in july, I've sent him a message (forget to inform - we don't  know each other) and he was a little upset coz of it... it was after I  started beeing in love with Cristiano Ronaldo... so I've written that he  (he's a footballer) is not as good player as Cris is, and so on. he  replied I should look for an older guy if I want... I felt so  embarrased... but I think he's cute still... we're going to one school,  so I'm gonna see him in the corridors... he won't write me back...  in less than 2 weeks I'm gonna go to school... I don't want to... but I  have to... and learn. again. maybe this year will be happier for me?  maybe this year I'm gonna show them all what I can? no. I'll sit and do  nothing - again. I'm mad about myself. I'm doing nothing to be better. I  think that I can be the best without working for it. keep yours dingers  crossed so I can do better at school....  :*

      I'd like to tell u all that i've seen "fahrenheit 9/11" yesterday & i  can say that it's a movie worth seeing. i never knew that politics are  pigs. so big pigs... they're just living great life spending our money.  we work and they almost don't. while watching it i wanted to kill this  all bush. just to show others that what he's doing is WRONG!!! we give work to those ppl in the government. they should be obligated to  care about their country, their ppl. but they don't care about us. they  care about their asses. nothing more.  remember: "fahrenheit 9/11" - movie worth seeing!
