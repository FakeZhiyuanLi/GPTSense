      How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now After all the years we been down Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you  So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it You even had the same type of childhood i did Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up To both yours and mine surprises Now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it As much as your pride tries to hide it Your cold, you touch its like ice In your eyes is the look of resenment I can sense it, and i dont like it  chorus again  It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse On my own album with a deal but shit got burst So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste Some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk Like yall was husband and wife or somethin But me catchin you fuckin other niggers musta hurt you pride or somethin Cuz you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me When all i tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced You actin like i aint you man and lyin like she can't be loose But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth But dont hate the game or the player Cuz the one that is changing is you  chorus  You're only at the top cuz my homie had to stop Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block Homies in the hood only she be on the tube Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who Fools i used to rap with all expect magic Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends Whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise (how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

      vegas was pretty chill, my little cousin threw a complete game 3 hitter with 7 strikeouts in his all star game on friday, which if you dont know...is extremely good. Saturday i woke up around 9, and chilled till about 1030 then went to my uncles house and then straight to the Skin Factory, got more added to my original tattoo. after that we chilled at the pool then went to the Texas and ate dinner and fucked around for a few hours until 10 and then went bowling to celebrate my aunts birthday. she may be 40, but she still partys like a teenager, by thega 2nd me she could barely walk...it was great. after that, came bck to our hotel and slept, woke up around 730 today and started home around 9...yeah so that was my trip....see ya'll around...hey..somebody write a damn comment every once and a while...damn...lol peace er'one

      It's been awhile, since I could  Hold my head high  It's been awhile since I first saw you  It's been a while since I could stand  On my own two feet again  It's been awhile since I could call you   But everything I can't remember  As fucked up as it all may seem  The consequences that I've rendered  I've stretched myself beyond my means   It's been awhile since I could say  That I wasn't addicted  It's been a while since I could say  I love myself as well  It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up  Just like I always do  But all that shit seems to disappear  When I'm with you   But everything I can't remember  As fucked up as it all may seem The consequences that I've rendered  I've gona and fucked things up again.   Why must I feel this way  Just make this go away  Just one more peaceful day   It's been awhile since I could  Look at myself straight  It's been awhile since I said I'm sorry  It's been awhile since I've seen the way  the candles light your face  But I can still remember  Just the way you taste   But everything I can't remember  As fucked up as it all may seem to be  I know it's me  I cannot blame this on my father  He did the best he could for me   It's been awhile since I could  Hold my head up high  And It's been awhile since I said I'm sorry...

IM GETTING TANNER!!! its kool...lol...and beach again tomorrow...tis good.   Ooo today at the beach...there were these 2 girls...funny as hell...they were putting on makeup at the beach. then they undid their straps while they were tanning...and then they got up and went somewhere, so Kona and i ran past their spot and "accidently" kicked sand all over their towels... then as we were leaving i tried shooting them with my lil squirt gun...we pussied out of tackling eachother on top of them...woulda been funny as hell tho and the sand woulda gotten all over their oiled up backs...woulda been great.. and today i got hammered...absolutely hammered by the huge ass wave...i was under water for 10 seconds...getting tossed around. When i finally came up i didnt know where i was for a few seconds..but i got really close to the pier. Later i got my back bent up like a V from another wave...lol all in all it was a good day lol... im out tho, peace

      just 15 minutes ago i was on my way home from dropping off random items at goodwill, and we passed the church thats a little past Vista High, and they had a sign like that always do where they put random sayings. Today's read "Time is valuable, spend it wisely." It made me wonder what i could do to spend my time wisely. Stay on aim all day and not do jack shit? i mean i do that all the time, i swear ive spent 2/3 of my summer online and the other 1/6 with the friends i was talking to while i was online, and the other 1/6 at the gym. which by the way, the gym hasnt helped at all...im still weighing close to nothing...but anyways, why spend all this time online? its not exactly necessary...so, time to cut down. i'll still be on every night most likly, but never as long anymore.  time cannot be spent wisely unless it is spent with you

      PLEASE DON'T GET ME WRONG because it was not like what you think I know that I've said a lot of things hurtful to you and I still realize that all your words are true. But please believe me that I will never do bad things to you, no matter what.      I might not have any chance to have it all, so the only thing I want to do is cherish what we have now.

      A hundred days had made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lights had made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same But all the miles had separate They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight it’s only you and me  The miles just keep rolling as the people either way to say hello I hear this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as we go  I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me  Everything I know, and anywhere I go it gets hard but it won’t take away my love And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done it get hard but it won’t take away my love   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight girl it’s only you and me I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams but tonight girl it’s only you and me

      ya know, a few seconds ago, i was jus chillin and thinkin of music and all of a sudden, Anthem of our Dying Day popped into my head. and i realized how sad i am becuz my dumb father broke my Story of the Year cd in half, on accident of course, but still, i miss them. lol. if anyone would care to lend me the cd so i can burn it until i have enough money to go buy a copy i would be very grateful.  but to soothe my soul for now, im just going to sing the songs inside my head, mostly cuz  it's too late to be singing at the top of my lungs... ok, im tired, and im getting up at 630 so i can be at jordans at 7 so he can kick my ass...we're going running and then working out somehow or another, im not totally sure what else you can do besides abs pushups and running while at the beach...but if anyone knows, it would be jordan. so yeah. off to bed, peace

      She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind Until the night  He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

      yeah so about last night...first band..ok, second band...horrible...waaay to emo, too slow, nothing energizing or anything at all, then there was the snake the cross the crown, they were funny, every intro was computer beats. and then the saviors, My American Heart. ho-ly-shit dude if you havent listened to this band...now is your chance, they are seriously the chillest group of guys, we talked with Steven the drummer forever after the show, and met everyone but larry the lead singer, steven is funny...he kept talking about a jewocaust.....in which the jews are going to go and kill all the germans, and then everyone else too. Anyways back to the show, the worst thing abotu the show was there were no moshing and no crowd surfing signs everywhere, but when MAH came on...no one really paid attention and like 5 people got thrown out after the first few songs. some stupid fool ran on the stage, then tried to jump into the crowd, only to aim for a spot that had no people...it was funny to see him fall on his face.  But anyways, the night was fun, Thank you francis geoff molly and kt for coming, I'm out tho, peace...  Just shut your eyes, and I won't bleed 'till you're sleepin'....  This Won't Stop - MAH
