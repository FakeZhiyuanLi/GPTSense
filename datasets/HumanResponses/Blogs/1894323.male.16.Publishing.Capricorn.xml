						   this is something i typed up on a whim a month or two into my relationship with leslie... it shouldn't be all that tough to figure out who it's about if you know me     You claim I never loved you but you’ve cut me apart from you Just like a gangrenous limb or an unwanted growth You have utterly and surgically removed me from you I wonder if you think of me, like I do you I miss you so much I almost think it’s unhealthy I’ve grieved more for you than I did ethan That kills me to realize You’ve moved on, as you think I have But you’re wrong No one actually knows how I feel You’re the only person I could talk to about it But I doubt you would care And if you did care I doubt you would want to hear it And if you wanted to hear it I doubt I’d have the balls/tact to actually discuss it maturely I can’t take this This is driving me absolutely insane I know you wouldn’t believe me if I told you any of this But it’s true Despite all that you think you know I miss you more than anything I would give my life to go back to that day in your basement Ethan, you, and I on the couch We being to scared to scoot any closer, despite the persistent tugging of our feelings The x-files playing in the background (I still remember the episode) That was the day I sat on frank (hahahaha) This feels so good to have this down on paper It’s like I’ve bled off all the extra pressure that’s been building up in my head Fuck building us a teleporter, what we need is a time machine I loved you with all my heart and soul You’ll never believe that I wish you would But I know you can’t Even if you wanted to I’m trying so hard to want what’s best for you It’s just so tough because I know that I’m not it I can’t stop thinking about you Replaying memories of you over and over in my head You’re beautiful You’re an incredible person A person I truly loved AND YOU DON’T EVEN BELIEVE ME I put you through hell I don’t deserve to even have the privilege of thinking about you I want you back so bad But I know that you’re so much happier without me I can’t take this I really really really really really can’t take this I wonder if I’ll ever show this to you I wonder how you would react If you would think this is all just another game I’m trying to get you to play I wouldn’t be surprised And I wouldn’t blame you in the least But this is not a game These are my thoughts I’ve given my heart to jesus, my body to leslie, and my mind to you What a fucking tangled web I weave  hmmmm, i'm seriously considering deleting this post so you're lucky to be reading this...

						   *note: that's a pic of my friend ethan in my previous post, yes, the one who got killed a little over a year ago*  i spent the night at nathan's 2 nights ago, but his grandfather didn't know so we had rachel over (not venema) and she brought me home at like 4:00 am, i slept till 4 pm then hung out 4 a little bit then went to the park with rachel premo, it was fun we ran into josh martin and ryan hawkins and we engaged in a little hand to hand combat (notify me if you're interested in making swords out of 1" dowels, quilt padding, and duct tape and beating the crap out of each other cuz i'm looking for some people 2 play with) then i got home and talked to sarah till like 4:30 in the morning, i woke up today, showered and watched empire strkes back, it's been a good day thus far...

						   sarah and i have just had "the talk"  the talk where you take a car jack, punch it into your breastbone, jack open ur ribcage, point to that little spot of your heart that only you and a few other know about, point to it, and say "this is where it hurts"  the talk where you talk about your past, discuss all the crap you've done, why you did it, who you did it with, all that fun stuff  the talk that takes the participants up 10,000% in their relationship, the talk where you become fellow human beings, not just characters to each other in your respective daily dramas  the talk is the first time you show your trust for each other  the talk is where you stop being friends, friends were what you were before, your something different now, neither of you is sure what it is but the dynamic of your relationship has just changed in some intangible and inescapable way  the talk is where a deeper and more meaningful relationship begins

Burdens are lifted from me,  that is my voice rising! -bright eyes, method acting  i love bright eyes, and i've also gotten btk to like them as well so rock on brian. i love these few lines, if you want some quality literature just look up the lyrics to that song, or just download it and listen to it...  in other news i've decided not to make a post about new orleans, it'd just be way to much to type. if you want to know about it just ask me.  ...so i've made peace with the fallen leaves...

						   (the title is a seemingly now-ancient modest mouse reference from sad sappy sucker) no, still no post about new orleans yet, i was just wondering, whats the deal with girls and skinny dipping, i've done it, it's an enjoyable experience, but it's like a DRIVE or girls to go swimming naked, maybe their swimsuits are really uncomfortable??? that would make sense because they're also crazy about just jumping in in their clothes... girls are weird...

						   ok, i just got back from new orleans so naturally i'm not gonna mention my trip in this post. ok, allow me to briefly touch on a subject thats been bothering me for 9 months or so, most of you know leslie cook, we went out for a while and it pretty much consisted of me babysitting her, so now we've been broken up for a little while and (shockingly enough) she's gone back to all the crap she was doing before (and granted, on the rare occasion, during) our relationship. it just pisses me off because she's obviously hurting and stuff and she just doesn't seem to "get it" x y and z is bad, don't do them, it shouldn't be that hard, i feel sorta bad because i left a rather harsh comment on her xanga (http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=starryeyes88) which i'll post here because it's my blog and i feel like it (i appologize for whatever if you find it offensive, except you leslie, you need to hear this stuff) once again leslie, you have proven to us all that without some1 directly supervising you, you turn into a drunken whore, and once agin, don't you find that a little sad? all your morals, everything you claim to stand for, to live for, it all goes out the window the first chance you get, i'm gonna make a magical prediction now, lets see if it comes true, you're gonna go to big stuf, think oh my god i've been so bad, be "good" for a month (hahaha if you can make it that long, my guess is you can't go a week) then go back to being a drunken whore again, like i said lets see if it comes true, i do need to thank you tho, if i'm ever witnessing to someone who knows you you have provided the perfect example of a hippocrit and the very embodiment of everything thats wrong with modern christianity, thank you for giving my lord a bad name by claiming to be a christian then turning around a muttering a "fuck you" or a "pass the smirnoff" in the same breath, please either choose one or the other, i don't know how you can expect anyone to ever hold any sort of respect for you...    -garrett-  (yes the last part is in the comment)  so thats whats been up in the last 10 minutes of my life, i'll probably update tomorrow about n-town  adios

						   1st and foremost, werd to all my homieez. that aside let me recap the day: didn't sleep last night because my stomach felt like it was trying unsucessfully to turn itself inside out which left me tossing and turning from 1 am to 8:30 am, at which point my stomach accepted defeat and allowed me to sleep for four blissful hours. after i woke up i figured out how to play terrified of flight by 764-hero (a very good song/band, czech them out if u get a chance) on guitar, wrote some more reviews on amazon, went out to dinner with the family then went over to jenny fisher's house to hang out with sarah, it was fun we watched zoolander (which i hadn't ever seen) then went out to northpoint to visit fish's bf ryan (who despite it being their one year aniversary had to work!) so yeah after that we went back to morgan's house and sat around for a few minutes, after which i got picked up by the magical ride fairy and whisked back home, i'm probably gonna do something with the thundercat hoes that were born unicorns like a phony madman later...

						   today sucked, granted pretty much anything would compared to yesterday but today sucked especially. i literally did nothing all day, except naturally write reviews on amazon.com, play guitar, download music, listen to music, check out upcoming shows, write a reasonably cool riff, etc. etc. ok maybe i did do stuff but not out of the house, so none of it counts... o yeah i also watched top gun today (i love that movie)

						   first of all let me just say i love my friends, you guys are great. so yeah me, btk, sarah buckner, and ansley went to six flag today for the rides/to see some really good christian bands. we also met up with jeremy and kaley when we got there. while we didn't end up seeing everyone we wanted to (cough, sarah, cough) we did have an amazing time, i finally got a chance to ride the superman, when reliant k was playing, right in the middle of their set it started to rain, it was soooo much fun, brian and ansley sort of stayed together (duh), and jeremy and kaley sort of stayed together(duh), and sarah and i sort of stayed together (not so much duh, yet still sorta duh), i was really happy it happened that way because i feel like we got to know each othera good bit better, she's an awesome girl and stephanie, thank you so much for accidentally leaving me on her buddy list hahaha

						   people say this story is sad, i don't get why   Boy Dies After Rescuing Friend From Pool   CHICAGO RIDGE, Ill. (AP) - A 6-year-old boy who rescued a playmate from a debris-filled swimming pool but couldn't get himself out of the water has died.   Donald Houser-Richerme had been hospitalized in critical condition since June 7, when rescue crews found his limp body in a half-empty pool at an apartment complex.   He died Monday, Police Chief Tim Baldermann said.   Donny had been exploring the area with his younger brother and a 5-year-old friend, Karah Moran, when they found the gate to the pool area unlocked and went in.    Karah either jumped or fell into the empty, shallow end of the pool, then slid on debris into the water gathered at the deep end. Though Donald couldn't swim, he jumped in after her and was able to push her to a ladder, family members said. But he couldn't save himself, and authorities said he was under water as long as 20 minutes.    ``That family has been through an awful lot this past week, and throughout the whole ordeal they've shown a lot of dignity, class and strength,'' Baldermann said.    Authorities said they would not file charges against the owner of the apartment complex after learning a maintenance man had cut the pool's lock.   THAT KID WAS SUCH A BADASS!!! dude i'd LOVE to go out saving someone, i mean i guess it's sad he didn't get to live life but he made more of an impact with his 6 years than 99% of people make with their 80+. i say there's nothing sad about that he went out like most of us would prefer to, having just pushed his friend to a ladder despite the fact that he himself couldn't swim, then after seeing his goal accomplished, his friend safe, he went. nothing wrong with that at all, i'm jealous of the little bastard

						   Pity does nobody good. If we show pity and mercy to the unfortunate, they will come to resent us for exposing their powerlessness. This resentment eats away unnoticed at the insides like a fungus. Feeling joy is better than feeling pity: in learning joy we learn not to hurt others.

						   my day thus far has consisted of sitting around and listening to bright eyes, check out lover i don't have to love and method acting. apparently there's been a certain group of people who, due to the fact that up untill recently they hadn't talked to me, think i'm very "far from god" at the moment, i have a request for you guys, if you have a problem/concern that involves me, please do the mature thing and come to me about it, don't go through my gabby ex gf because she's just gonna make everything worse, that's all i ask, if you are worried about me please just give me a call, don't go asking around or spread rumors and other crap like that. for the info of anyone who's interested, me and the big man are just fine at the moment, thank you all for your concern

						   hey everyone, i'm rather bored and tired so i'll probably go to bed after i post this. i was going to go to the shins show with molly however she cancelled on me at the last minute which wasn't all that cool but she appologized and it wasn't really her fault. so instead i went with btk to see chronicles of riddick (wow i didn't know movies could be that bad/drugged up, imagine dune mixed with yellow submarine) then off to jamie's suprise party, i ended up going with vicki, kelly driver, laura, and richard to wendy's then to the mb parking lot/playground, you guys are great.  tomorrow i might be going up to lanier with kelly (yes irealize the irony that i'm leaving for the same place my family has just been for 3 days) hmmm, maybe i'll watch full metal jacket and THEN go to bed, who knows?

						   i stumbled across this poem via www.plagiarist.com  How do they do it, the ones who make love without love?  Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away.  How do they come to the come to the  come to the  God  come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin?  These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God.  They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health--just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time. -sharon olds

						   hey, in my last post i said i was done with this blog, looks like i was lying. summer can get rather tedious and this is just one more thing to occupy my time. also a few people have asked me to start again which was suprising because 1)didn't know anybody read it and 2)didn't know anybody who read it liked it. so yeah recently life's been rather nuts. it's pretty much consisted of hanging out with nathan, hanging out with molly and rachel, going to shows, bothering jonbenet ramsey etc. etc. recently i went to the unicorns at the echo lounge with molly/rachel, and joy electric with jordan, michael, and nick, last night my parents left for like two days so nathan, molly, rachel, and i went swimming then got a bunch of stuff and grilled ou...in... then we went to the square, sat and talked at coolbeans, then we went to the big memorial cemetary and did improv games in the mausoleum for an hour or so. got home at 4:00 or so, molly and rachel left about 30 minutes after that even though they SAID they'd spend the night, actually they had to get up early to go to some camp training or something so it's call good, then nathan and i fell asleep and he left at about 5:00, all in all a very good night   sigh, i love my friends  (NOTE: these are NOT song lyrics this is a poem i wrote and am actually rather fond of so please read it and tell me what you think)  The sea of asphalt slept Past the young pines Below the patch of dirt Striped with the yellow lashings Of a government owned Diesel-run cat o’nine tails The sea of asphalt slept  The sea of asphalt slept Not knowing her audience Gazing down from the pine fortress I looked on in wonder as The sea of asphalt slept  The sea of asphalt slept Massaged into complacency With the rhythmic caressing Of warm rubber kisses Resting to the lullaby Of screeching brakes Cones of paper vomiting Electronic waves The sea of asphalt slept

						   destination unknown was amazing, nathan and i ruled the system, i don't feel like typing out why right now though, maybe tomorrow, i just got back from a hot date with sarah, i think i had more fun in those few hours than in the entire last week, i love just being with her it's kinda crazy.  we went and saw the village today, i really enjoyed it but sarah didn't, she was expecting ur basic scary movie and was therefor dissappointed when it didn't deliver, i was actually rather relieved it was more than that, it turned out to be more of an expertly filmed two-hour sociology project, which was just FINE by me, i LOVE movies like that and this one definetly fit the bill.  after that we went and had dinenr at chili's good times, then we went back to her house and watched big fish, yet another most excellent movie. i made the best drink ever and i have no idea what to call it/classify it as, the recipe is as follows:  ingredients: 2 banana's 2.5 cups frozen strawberries 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt 2 scoops vanilla icecream 1/4 cup orange juice  directions: blend on high till it's done  i think it was the best drink i've ever had/made, feel free to make it urself (i may have screwed up the ammounts, i never actually measure stuff, eyeballing is the way to go)  till next time -  G  arrett

						   Yeah, not in the best of moods right now. I really wish I hadn't been a dumbass tonight and had hung out with Sarah like I WANTED to, rather than go get glared at by uncle Richard and drive through downtown. We've gone downtown so much that we've done it all, there's no more novelty anymore and that really blows. We've done everything there is to do around here, nothing else around here, nothing else downtown, nothing else at the square, nothing else in kennesaw, I've done it all, and that kinda sucks to realize cuz I'm stuck here for a few more years. It's been amazing but it sucks now that I finished. I think I'm just gonna go read salinger or something, I wish Sarah would make some hint about her and Morgan coming to visit me because I'd jump all over that, but I'd feel like a deuchebag if I asked them to come after what I did earlier tonight. o well, I don't think she will. I guess we'll just (hopefully) hang out tomorrow but she made it sound like she might not want to. Oh well whatever. Another thing that was kinda blah tonight was I finally got around to telling Laura how I feel really bad about how I treat her and how I'm gonna fix it and she sorta blows me off (Laura I know you're gonna read this and I just KNOW I'm gonna end up having this conversation with you online about how you're so sorry and that's not what you meant, well either way it's how it felt to me so lets just both save ourselves from carpal tunnel shall we?) damn my vicodin stash from the wreck finally ran out on me, that definitely sucks jah? I was hoping I could take some tonight and maybe actually go to bed at a reasonable time, yes I realize how strange that must sound coming from me. I'm going to destination unknown tomorrow night, I'm guessing we're going to Charleston or some other port city, we'll see how that turns out I suppose.        i wysh ai phelt güd -> now, (I) unfortewnatli aye downt  (I wish i felt good right now, but unfortunately I don't)

						   i love catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books, molly and rachel have gotten me onto reading out loud with people, so who wants to have some salinger read to them? i chilled with boda and his friend monica last night, or actually really early this morning if you wanna get technical... it was fun, we hung out on the playgroud, did a coloring book, watched infomercials and played candyland, i'm addicted to my white honeydew tea from harry's, there's&nbsp;nothing better in the world, i'm convinced. i can't go to curiosa because apparently my mom can't get back the money for "destination unknown" at mb *cough*b.s.*cough* but whatever, that should be fun as well... the murcury rev is an amazing band, give them a czech, and if you haven't looked at those links i put on my last post PLEASE do. wanna know something i was thinking about earlier, it's this: how many of you have ever heard of darfur? probably not many, even though it's almost universally considered to be the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet, over 10 million people have been displaced and over 2 million have been killed by pro-government militia's attempting ethnic cleansing of the non-arab population, if bush was really against the arab's wouldn't he make this a HUGE deal and encourage sanctions/other political action like most other western nations have done? ironically enough FRANCE is the one carrying the torch for this one, but bush hasn't said a word, you could watch american news all day without hearing it mentioned once, but if you go to any international news source it's probably the first headline you see, why? sudan doesn't have any oil, therefor bush isn't interested, bush isn't a religious fanatic or anti-muslim, he's just a deuchebag who needs cheap oil. so yeah, thats what's been on my mind  DISARM THE JANJAWID MILITIA!!!

						   is there anything better than reading salinger and sipping tea during a thunderstorm? the answer is yes but the list is short. one thing on that list is definetly sarah buckner, wow it must be annoying to hear me always talking about her but you guys can deal with it, this girl is incredible, we've been back from the lake for about 4 hours and i already miss being around her, it's so tough to not be able to just lean over and whisper if i want to talk to her after having that luxury for two and a half amazing days, it's 10:11 right now, if we were at the lake we would be cuddling to our nightly movie on the couch right now, but unfortunately we arn't at the lake, i'm sitting here at my computer listening to murcury rev wishing it was 16 hours ago... (2:00 am this morning, those of us who need to know why already do...)   urlLink www.amnesty.org   guys this is the site for amnesty international, a humanitarian watchdog group, check out their site, read a few articles, maybe write an e-mail or two, most of the things they talk about the network news stations don't, some other good sites to hear about the news we don't are:   urlLink http://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage  &nbsp; urlLink www.reuters.com    urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/   urlLink www.globalsecurity.org   check out these sites and maybe even bookmark a few

						   wow, i had the best time at the lake, i'm so glad sarah was able to come with me, what an amazing couple of days! i loved our nightly movies, searching for an empty beach, playing chicken with the redneck lady, guess what time it is? FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING! hahahaha. sarah and i officially have the coolest devices to hold up our pants ever ( i have a black leather belt with hot pink stars, and she has black suspenders, we are awesome... sarah-my back still hurts from the fish! ian and i-but that was like 2 days ago... sigh... what an amazing trip, sarah and i spent practically every minute together and i like her more than ever!

						   well, here we are, thursday night, nothing going on, lake tomorrow with sarah, should be fun, curiosa is gonna be amazing interpol, mogwai, the rapture, cursive, the cure, and a few others, it's gonna be soooo huge! i wish my house wasn't so damn hot, i swear to god i could scramble eggs between my leg and nutsack right now. i feel like going on a walk for a few hours, maybe i'll sneak out tonight and do that, just to walk.&nbsp; conan o'brian made fun of the ukraine one show and was sent hate mail by them the next day, he didn't know he was on there so in order to find out where else he was on he made fun of a few countries every day after that. i think i'm gonna make fun of a random group and see if anyone cares... o wait, no i'm not, i'm too damn lazy... i think i might go take&nbsp;a cigar apart and smoke up a sweet jewel out of my corncob pipe, idk, it's a tempting idea... boda if you read this we definetly need to hit up the playground at 1:30 again, that was amazing, i wish everyone would just chill out, there are very few problems that don't instantly become 99% solved when you just relax, so everyone try that, just take a few slow deep breaths and relax, it's ok.&nbsp; a "certain group" (see sarah i did it) of people are freaking gabby cowards who need to put down the tofu and pick up the damn phone if they have a problem, casey jones in ninja turtles was the ultimate fighter, he had a cricket bat and hockey goalie mask, you can't freakin top that. dude if i had a magic carpet i'd so go over a hurricane, think about how sweet that would look! think about how much fun it would be to completely kick the crap out of a morbidly obese person, it'd just be so much FUN, especially if he was jewish, dressed in full rabbi garb, and kept screaming in yiddish the whole time, oh man that'd be great...   that was fun, now on to whatever rambling i may/may not have left in me: looks like i might get a keyboard in my room now, i think that if i do get it i'll teach myself to play, thats whats great about keyboards/pianos, once you learn them you're forced to learn so much theory it makes anything else a whole lot easier, and there's few things cooler than a guy sitting down at a piano and playing, let me once again express my philosophy on relaxation, JUST CHILL OUT there's no reason to worry about stuff, who by worrying can add a single day to his life-jesus, so listen to jc and take a few breaths and just chill out dude...   on that note, adios  g-rizzle

						   six flags today, it was fun yet hot. hung out with jeremy, mitchell, rachel, and sarah the whole time, rachel got on my nerves so bad, it's just something about her scathing mixture of naivete/outright stupidity thats like a itch that i can't quite reach,&nbsp;it's a good thing that&nbsp;i didn't have a chainsaw on me today or else there may very well have been some hardcore scratching done... i also lost my pocket bible there, it upset me a lot more than i thought it would. i had lots of notes and stuff written in there, all of downhere's autograph's along with their faveorite bible verses, and&nbsp;more than a few&nbsp;memories. thank goodness that sarah is as incredible as she is or else i might've flipped today, i mean i was already in a kinda bad mod cuz i haven't been sleeping well lately, then i lose my bible, then i have rachel yapping on about how sarah has to sit with her for all the rides because all meat eaters are gonna burn in hell or something like that (note: not a direct quote) so yeah then afterwards the plan was that we were gonna eat dinner at paneras then sarah was gonna come over for a little while, then like 20 minutes after we talked about it she texts caroline and's like yeah so is it ok if rachel and i come over 2nite etc. etc. so i was just kinda like ummmmm that's special.... i mean it's not a big deal cuz we'll probably end up hanging out 2morrow and then she's coming to the lake with me this weekend, but still, it kinda bothered me anyway... it was probably just some sort of miscommunication or something, i'm not upset about it it was just sort of one more thing on top of lots of others.&nbsp;she did make me feel really good when she asked me what was wrong on the way home, you know in the six and a half months leslie and i were going out i think she asked me that MAYBE three times, and all of those times i was perfectly fine, it was always me asking leslie cuz i was always the one dealing with her crap, my feelings on that kind of thing are that i enjoy being there for people through anything, there's nothing u can't call me up at 4:30 am and talk to me about, just if i'm gonna give that to you i need to know that i can come to you too. and i just don't think i ever really felt that with leslie, so sarah asking me that was a really big deal, it made me smile to think that there's actually someone who will actually realize when somethings bothering me and ask me about it, that means a whole lot to me. so in short: sarah's&nbsp;an amazing&nbsp;girl, i feel like everyday you give me a new reason to care about you like i do, you're incredible and i love the fact that we're together    *sarah i decided not to take rachel's name out, just in the future i won't use names*  if any of you have a problem with what i write in here feel free to take it up with me, don't sit there and talk about me behind my back you gabby cowards, i look foreward to the day when u realize how worthless your pitiful existence on this earth is, that soon it will be over, and that nobody will miss you 404-723-8297

						   as the title of this post suggests, i really don't have much to say.&nbsp; i like sarah so much it's kinda crazy, i also have a newfound love of her car...&nbsp; we were supposed to hang out tonight but i had to go out to dinner with my family cuz my dad sold the company, he has such a sweet gig till november, he's getting paid double and he's officially unemployed, what a jew. it's cool tho cuz he'll probably buy the second jetski/boat soon now, he also bought me the echo and the bunnymen cd so thats good, i also bought the new underoath at target today (doesn't that just make you cringe?)&nbsp; it's like old underoath and further seems forever had some sort of strange yet awesome love child (michael and jordan have official cred for that observation but i thought it too) i've figured something out about sarah's friends, they're all cool&nbsp;as long as u keep them separated, or just with sarah, but as soon as they all get together they become the most annoying people ever, crazy... hahaha my mom thinks i'm smoking again cuz my incense smells like pot, so i can't burn it anymore :(&nbsp; i wanna be somewhere so badly right now, i just need to figure out where that is...&nbsp; ahhh i hate it when i get like this, i feel rediculously frusterated and i have no idea why (maybe it's because i'm having trouble dealing with my underlying homosexuality?) hahaha just kidding, but seriously i hate this feeling, it's more annoying than anything but still... maybe i have more to say than i thought, i guess i'll just keep writing till i run out of things to say. how is a lioness furrow/furrowed? i can't wait to go hang-gliding with nathan in chattanooga, it's gonna be amazing, sarah we're GOING to find a way for you to come with us. o yeah thats something else. sarah's coming to the lake with my family for a few days this weekend, i'm really excited. brian and ansley, if either of u read this, you are both invited as well, i'll probably call you tomorrow after six-flags. this must be rather boring to read, if only i cared... hahaha i almost typed this must be boring to live, then i realized i'm the one living it, how very ironic (to me at least) and it can be rather boring at some times, but life finds a way to go on (most of the time) this is fun, i like just rambling on here, it's a nice way to get my thoughts out... i think i'll keep going, i wonder if there's a limit to the size of posts on here, i doubt there is. echo and the bunnymen rock, give them a czech if u haven't heard of them. i want to go for a walk tonight, if anyone wants to join me let me know before like 2:30/3:00 am  adios, iceberg coolio (my camp hope nickname)

						   I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring I'd give you my lifecause I don't own anything. It seemed like the bottom was all that I had until now I'd give you my life if you'd give me yours somehow.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -further seems forever, new years project &nbsp; gotta love it man, sarah and morgan randomly dropped by last night (i love it when people do that) we hung out on my porch for 45 minutes or so, they're about to come over again, we're gonna mellow out to some chill music, incense, and herbal relaxers, it'll be a kickin' good time, maybe we'll go thrifting too, who knows! &nbsp; mitch hedberg rocks, but after listening to him for an hour i started to talk/think like him: &nbsp; i got a nosebleed one time and i thought i just had red snot, i ran over to my friend and he was like nah man, ur nose is bleeding.......all right &nbsp; i could never work out but if i did i would do push-downs the whole time, i call them push downs instead of push ups cuz it's good for my self esteem, see i like to think that i'm the one staying still and i'm just so damn strong i'm moving the whole planet......all right &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   I live in a house with 99 other people. They keep bringing these gasoline-soaked rags into the house -- their rooms, the bathroom, the kitchen -- everywhere. I keep telling them, "Really, this is a bad idea: One of these days these rags are going to catch on fire and burn the house down." They laugh me off. "We have been bringing these rags in for long before you were here. There was never any fire" they say. Personally, I try to keep my room as fireproof as possible, but I know that when the house catches on fire, I will die with the rest of them. I would move out, but there is nowhere else to go. Really, I have tried to explain the dangers, but I always get "God would never let that happen," or "We should really bring in fewer rags each day," or maybe, "We can keep our gasoline-soaked rags in the bathroom, to make more room in the kitchen," or even "I hear that someone is working on some kind of special cloth that will prevent gasoline from igniting." I say "But think of the risks: we could all die." I hear, "Actually, statistically speaking, only 3/4 of us would die," or "I have studies household fires at NYU, and I disagree, statistics clearly show that the casualty rate is most likely to be 35%. While bringing in fewer rags per day or working on making the rags harmless are probably good things to try, somehow I just refuse to be comforted. And I just can't get over the feeling that arguing over how many of us will die is just a waste of time. Sometimes we argue over whether many little rags or fewer big rags is more to blame for the problem. Some have been convinced that gasoline soaked rags really are a problem, and we should switch to Alcohol-soaked rags. Others say alcohol is too expensive, really we should switch to diesel-soaked rags. This argument seems to take up a lot of interest. The idea that we might have to keep a constant number of flammable rags in the house is just to bizarre even to discuss, much less reducing the total number. This frustrates me to the point of just not wanting to talk about the issue anymore. Lately I have had this thought, though: There really are not that many rags lying around just yet. Maybe if there were a small fire, it would get everyone's attention. Maybe then, the other 99 people in my home would come together to fight the fire. The home would be damaged, maybe severely, but if we manage to get the fire out, it might really focus every one of us that we really, really need to stop bringing gasoline-soaked rags into the house. Problem is, I don't want to light any matches. If I do, I will surely be killed by my housemates. But there is this one guy who is really, really careless with matches. It's not that he is deliberately destructive, just accident prone, and more than willing to play with fire. Maybe if I convinced everyone that he is the guy who should be doing the cooking.... I hope you will all join me in voting for Bush this election.  -Jeff B.&nbsp;The Dalles, Oregon

						   i've had the most amazing last couple of days...  ok, my friend molly wanted me to sleep over at her house the night of the third with some people but my parents said no, so i made sure my family went to the lake house for a few days. they left thursday afternoon. i slept over at michaels house and watched some sweet anime and made some dreams come true with his monosynth. then the next day i played ultimate frisbee with jeremy and bj and saw sarah for a few minutes, then i went over to jeremy's house for the first time in FOREVER and played goldeneye with him and his little brother. then that night jeremy and michael and daniel hung out at my house, we ordered pizza, duct-taped jeremy's cardoor on, watched the big lebowski, killed a kangarat ('possum), left people awesomely xhardcorex messages at like 3:30 am, then finally went to bed at like 5:30, the next morning at 8:30 molly and rachel picked me up to go c the 4th of july parade at marietta square (yes i realize it was the 3rd) it was really great, we were ourselves so naturally all sorts of crazy things happened, we ate at some australian place or something for lunch then we went to eddie's trick shop and each put on like 10 different costumes, hopefully i'll eventually get the pictures because they are absolutely hilarious. we then went swimming at some random pool, played some intense monkey in the middle, and slapped cameron in the face with a squishy frog, "molly quammen you're my hero", eric (our ride) locked his keys in his car and after cameron spent like 15 minutes trying to jimmy the lock we gave up and rode with nikki to the square, eric is not exactly what we'd call skinny or tan btw, he locked all his clothes in his car along with his keys  so he's just in a swimsuit, so we go to the square and nikki has a jeep so we unzip her window and eric's looking for a shirt to put on, nikki walks up and is like "what're u doing in my car!?" just as these two cops ride by on bikes, they jump off and are about to do some business when she's like omg nevermind they're my friends. we went to erich's house and he got some clothes, we went back to the square and got set up for the fireworks show, erich went and got us some fried chicken and sweet tea from mrs.winners, we got the best seat EVER for the fireworks, we were so close pieces were falling on us, i really impressed every1 and myself when rachel took my bible and opened it to a random verse and i correctly guessed the book and chaper, and it wasn't a major verse it was some obscure thing. after that we hung out for a while then we went swimming again at erich's pool, some other really drunk people hopped the fence with us, we had a lot of fun, after that we (molly, rachel, cameron, nikki, and i) went to le maison de les poulles and layed out in the field on blankets talking and telling stories and watching ufo's and shooting stars it was an incredible night, after that molly and cameron went to cameron's house and nikki, rachel, and i all went to rachel's house and spent the night, ...yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah..., then this morning we got up and got everything together for the cookout at the quammen's, we made all kinds of burgers and stuff and USA JELLO!!!!! everything was soooo good, we all hung out outside laying on blankets and playing with the dogs and all kinds of really awesome summer stuff that makes you incredibly happy to be alive. wow i love my friends, you can tell your true friends because you like who you are around them and they make you happy to be alive. so then my dad picked me up later that night and i grabbed my quidditch goggles and with a quick round of hugs i was off, i got home and my mom was flipping out cuz she's stressed cuz she has 2 leave 2morrow and there was airsoft pellets everywhere in my house and pizza boxes and dirty dishes and stuff that daniel michael and i all left around the house (oops), now i'm here typing this rediculously long entry and about to write a letter to my mom for when she's in costa rica. then i have to go pack for BIG STUF WHICH IS TOMORROW so i've been a busy kid...   i love my friends

						   (another mm reference in the title for all you newfound glory fans out there)  so sarah, michael, rachel and i all went to see spider-man 2 yesterday, i don't think there was a single scene in it where the characters weren't crying... but yeah anyway the movie was good, the company was better, afterwards we went to starbucks, then the park, all good, sarah and i had a little talk and we're exclusive now, once again all good.  i'm as happy as i am tired

						   i like freemasonry, it's late, so i e-mailed thomas blanton, the grand master of the grand lodge of georgia, my e-mail was as follows:  Hello sir, My name is Garrett Kelly, I am a sixteen year old resident of marietta and have been interested in freemasonry for nearly half of my life.  I was wondering what the minimum age of a mason is in the state of Georgia and i figured nobody would know better than you would. Since I realize I am probably too young at this point do you have any suggestions as to any sort of program/activities i could participate in which would be helpful to me once I am finally old enough to submit my application to my local lodge?  thank you, Garrett Kelly   as i told jordan, this is what happens when i'm bored late at night, i start joining ancient fraternities

						   first day of school, not many people in my classes, there's a cool girl named emily who moved here from new york in psych, scott and michael are in spanish, daniel and jeremy are in lunch, and sarah's in bio but smyser's a nazi so we're not gonna be doing much talking in there...  i did, however write a freaking sweet autobiography that i hopefully will get back from frau smyser and put on here because i rather like it... also, i'm in a team taught lit class, how cool is that? that means it's the stupid class, i'm in there with erica brown and people of similar intelligence so i'm sure that'll be an easy class, the assistant teacher is named duncan-fraker, so whenever i call her i say "Heil frau dünkin-frokkur!"  it's quite enjoyable

						   wow, limo riding to plane flying jet skiing, this is what summer's all about  flight lesson was amazing, sarah and dad came along for the ride, we took off, the guy told me to fly around, i took us over lake allatoona and back, it was amazing, there's just something about being in the air... especially since we were relatively low so we could still see things in pretty good detail, there's stuff all around us we don't even notice that looks amazing from the sky: i.e. the dam for alke allatoona, you never actually see it, all you see is a wall, but from the air you can see how the lake is so much higher and where the river used to flow, you can see the jagged crater of the kennesaw rock quarry, from the ground it would just look like a space without trees. being in control magnified the experience 100-fold. i highly suggest, if you have any planes available, flying them immediately. then that night i left for the lakehouse, parents were being gay so i just decided to go to bed at like 8:00, i woke up SIXTEEN HOURS later at 12:00 (amazing) feeling refreshed and revitalized, i rode jetski's most of the day, took everyone tubing, stuff like that. orientation tomorrow, i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able to cope with going back to school, although i do look foreward to telling everyone how my last WEEK has been, much less my entire summer. this summer has been absolutely incredible and i hate to see it go. however i think i'll be ok (more on my recent philosophical ponderings later) o and in other news i've become addicted to mt. eerie by the microphones. the cd, it's sort of a concept cd in that it is sort of a map of life, it begins pre-birth and meanders on past death. it tells the tale of a man being born, engaging in the wonder of being alive, becoming frightened of death, running away but eventually being overtaken, realizing the cyclicity of life, embracing death as a means to become one with the universe, and just being fully awesome. if you want to listen to it let me know and i'll let you borrow it in a heartbeat, hell i'll burn you a copy but you NEED to hear this if your at all into concept/weird/awesome music  ...flow over me solar wind...

						    well last night was alright, nathan rachel sarah and i all hung out and had a good time, but nancy was being weird so that put a damper on things, we all went swimming in our clothes (except me, i was wearing boxers so i just swam in those) after watching some of starsky and hutch. then at the pool caroline and morgan showed up (joy) i have no problem with morgan just i had really hoped it would just be the four of us for the night. it seems like every time i'm having a good time with sarah a veritable battalion of her best buds decide to drop by and suck the fun out of whatever we happen to be doing. that was definetly the case last night... after we left sarah's we went over to kroger and met up with toni and her friend jen, it wasn't a bad time either, we bought some food then nathan dropped me off at home, i texted sarah a few times, read a little salinger then went ot bed.      -  G  arrett
