						   I haven't posted for quite some time...I don't think.&nbsp; I really don't know.&nbsp; Has it been a week, or a mere couple of days??&nbsp; Shit, I need some coffee.  I'm actually feeling pretty good today, despite the fact that I lost track of the days.&nbsp; I got bubble gum today for the first time in years.&nbsp; I forgot I ever enjoyed gum.&nbsp; I watched Daria today.&nbsp; There was a couple decent episodes on.&nbsp; The Fifth Element is on now, too.&nbsp; Really, that's all I have to say.&nbsp; Gum and television is the only thing that's keeping me in this good mood.&nbsp; Damn, I guess I'm happier by nature than people give me credit for.&nbsp; HAHA FUCK YOU ALL, I'M NOT A MELODRAMATIC LOSER.  Ahhh...that felt good.&nbsp; Now I can go back to watching the movie.

						   I really don't have anything important to say.&nbsp; I just decided it's been too long since I've last posted.&nbsp; So, prepare for a ramble or just leave and read something else with your precious time on this planet.&nbsp; And so it begins: &nbsp; Yesterday I watched "Secret Window".&nbsp; That was quite the movie.&nbsp; Steven King must have been doing&nbsp;a sick,&nbsp;horrorshow hallucinigen produced and shipped from some native tribe of Africa.&nbsp; What an amazing guy, just think that's one story, he has written such a large library of fantastical yet fearsome stories.&nbsp; Johnny Depp, of course, just makes the effect of this film that much more strange.&nbsp; It was definately a flick worth watching. &nbsp; That's all I really have to say.&nbsp; I'll just go back to reading "Clockwork Orange".&nbsp; Perhaps I'll even indulge in the amazing world of chinese beliefs again.&nbsp; That's where I've been for the last few hours.&nbsp; I suggest that everyone else take a few minutes of their time and read about the Tao.&nbsp; It's quite a thought to dwell on, and if you're as bored as me then you have nothing better to do anyway. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   I went to my dad's today.&nbsp; That's where I'm residing now, and where I probably will be residing for the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; I really like it here, but it's really boring.&nbsp; I just can't stand being so far away from my friends.&nbsp; That's about the only downside, though.&nbsp; I'd do just about anything to get away from Wes. &nbsp; Nothing special happened today.&nbsp; It was rather bland in its entirety.&nbsp; So far the highlight has been...well, there hasn't been one.&nbsp; Now, I'm watching the South Park marathon, that's about the only thing that's worth commenting on.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and I found this awesome philosophy forum:&nbsp;  urlLink http://http://amazingforums.com/forum2/DTHUNDER/forum.html  &nbsp; That's it. I'm done.&nbsp; There's absolutely nothing else for me to talk about.

						   I'm feeling pretty good now.&nbsp; At this exact moment, at least.&nbsp; I think I'll probably keep in this mood for a while, but, I&nbsp;wouldn't swear to it.&nbsp; Now, I'm just posting and enjoying a peach.&nbsp; Let me assure it is one damn good peach.&nbsp; Those amish really are strange, but they can grow a peach. &nbsp; The trip to the dentist was quite a dissapointment.&nbsp; I didn't get the dentist with nine fingers.&nbsp; All I got to do was shake his hand, and some other lady cleaned my teeth.&nbsp; She was still pretty cool, but nothing like the nine-fingered man.&nbsp; The only bright shining moment of the trip was a stop at Custartd's Last Stand, which just opened in Warrensburg.&nbsp; Damn, custard is good. &nbsp; I then went to Stanton's house.&nbsp; That was quite a fun time, too.&nbsp; I was just playing this little progression and Stanton just happened to be playing random notes in that scale.&nbsp; When we both realized how fantastic it sounded we both ended at the exact same time on an E.&nbsp; We did that little improv-type thing for like 10 minutes straight, but it will never be as perfect as that first time. &nbsp; We later watched "The Butterfly Effect".&nbsp; It was a really good flick, but I'm not even gonna try to explain it, go rent it for yourself.&nbsp; We went outside and watched the stars from like 11 to 3.&nbsp; It was quite fun, too.&nbsp; Stars bring out the best in deep conversation, let me tell you.&nbsp; They also bring out quite a bit of good music convo.&nbsp; Vampires too, we saw one fly by, it made this hideous screeching sound as it passed.&nbsp; We're pretty certain it was Rachel's mom. &nbsp; Oh yeah, I went to Rachel's today.&nbsp; Her, Susan, Jon, and Jimmy were all there.&nbsp; It was a fairly fun endeavor.&nbsp; It was definately not as fun as expected/prophesized by Susan's dream, but fun none-the-less.&nbsp; Rachel made this coffee drink, it was the shit.&nbsp; She's now my hero. &nbsp; We went to Mr. Goodcents, too.&nbsp; My mom was super-mad because I was supposed to be at Rachel's when she got there, but oh well.&nbsp; It wasn't my fault.&nbsp; Now, I'm beat, though, and I'm gonna go.

						   I woke up at 7 o'clock this morning.  I was told I had to, but then had no reason to.  They lied.  I could definately have slept in for another three hours.  Since I'm up anyways I decided that I should just go ahead and make some coffee.  I've been thinking about all the things that can be done to musically improve Clinton.  Thirteen Moons will of course be a small factor in the musical scene.  All this random thought was inspired by  urlLink The Flaming Lips .  I was reading about the parking lot and boom box experiments.  It was definately a life affirming thought.  It's just good to think that 30 year old musicians from the post-punk era can do something so adventurous for the world of music.  Now, I'm just randomly browsing pages on  urlLink Wikipedia .  I love Wikipedia, especially the "random page" button.  It was really good today, too.  I love it when it just jumps you to gigantic ideals that I can never grasp.  It's just so fun to jump from one to the other.  Sometimes, though, you'll get a handful of pages from some crappy town no one's ever heard of.    Ah...back to drinking my coffee bye, bye

						   I survived through mowing.  Even on a hot-ass day like this, I managed to get done mowing.  Now I have nothing to be anxious about, nothing to fear.  Yes sir, there's nothing but good times in my immediate future.  I'm thinking I'm probably gonna hang out with Clint tomorrow.  Sounds pretty good, eh??  Well, it doesn't end there.  Of course, I get to see the finger-short dentist.  Then I get to go hang out with Stanton.  Then, I get to go hang out with Rachel and Susan.  It's definate now, because Rachel's back in her house!!  Hmmm...I think we can all take something from this:  If you have low expectations, you can be easily surprised.  With that I'm gonna get off of here and quit wasting my time on Blogger, at least for today.  **Don't forget to check out Ralph Nader's website:   urlLink nader.org

						   I was so rudely awakened at 8AM today.  Merely minutes after waking I was hauled off to Chilhowee with Wes.  What a bummer that is??  After breakfast we went to Warrensburg to get my allergy shot.  I was forced to spend a good 3 hours with Wes today, and it's still only 10:30.  The ride to Warrensburg sucked so bad.  Wes is just so proud of his  used  truck.  He just puts too much into that piece of crap.  He could have saved money and took another vehicle, but that wouldn't be manly enough.  He just has to overcompensate for everything.  It is the first vehicle he has had with A/C in like 5 years.  He doesn't use it, though.  He kept trying to start conversation with me, but I'd much rather just keep to myself.  I hate talking to people, there's only a handful of people that I enjoy talking to.  I suppose I'm gonna have to go mow in a few minutes.  I'm getting out of it now because the grass is still wet.  As much as I hate mowing, I have to do it today or I won't be able to do anything the rest of the week.  I have big plans, too.  I think I'm gonna go hang out with Stanton on Wednesday, then go hang out with Rachel and Susan on Thursday.  Perhaps that will bring me up, if it all works.  Damn, I really don't want to mow.  Mowing has got to be the worst activity ever.  It makes no logical sense, either.  Gas is like $2 a gallon now, and people use probably a gallon a week mowing their yards.  Just think how much gas we would save if no one in the country mowed their yard for one week.  It's one thing to use gas for things that we need, but using it for needless things like that is one of the reasons OPEC can rape us anytime they want.  Oh, well...I guess my opinion's not gonna change anything.  Hmmm...perhaps Nader can do something about it??    urlLink

						   I'm absolutely certain of it.  It's only 8 o'clock, and I'm already super-tired.  I'm not even gonna attempt to sleep, though.  Mom and Wes are gone, so I'm determined to make the best of this moment.  I'm sure they're having fun wherever they're at, so I'm gonna have fun, too, even if it takes making a pot of coffee this late.  I've been in a super-lazy mood all day today.  The whole day got off on the wrong foot when I had to spend 2 hours in the faggy truck listening to country music.  That's always a rude awakening.  I'll have to spend quite some amount of car time with Wes tomorrow, too, because I have to go to Warrensburg to get allergy shots and he's the only transportation I have.  I was too lazy to get out my Ibanez today.  I really wanted to play it, too.  I just played my Epiphone because it was already out.  The high E string broke, though.  That was of course quite a bummer.  I was too lazy to stop playing, though.  I just removed the string and played without it.  I'm just in too bad of a mood to care about anything now.  I think I could keel over and die and it wouldn't bother me a bit.  I have to mow tomorrow.  I really hate this position my parents have me in.  If I ever want to have any fun, then I have to work my ass off beforehand.  I think I'm going to Stanton's on Tuesday, it better be fucking fun to make up for all of this shit.  I'm beginning to think that my plans with Rachel and Susan are gonna fall through.  I haven't talked to Rachel since Friday.  Damn, what a bummer.  I guess I'll go back to listening to my depressing music, again.  It's not like anything's gonna bring me up.  I might as well just bask in my sadness.  You know what they say, "When it rains it pours."

						   It's hot today.  Amazingly hot.  I'm even a little warm sitting here in the A/C.  I really don't know what to do with myself.  I could go play guitar, but I'm too lazy.  How pathetic is that??  I had to ride all the way to Kingsville today.  It was an hour each way, Wes was there, too.  We only spent ten minutes there.  It was a terrible ten minutes, but I must say the two hours of Toby Keith (along with other various pop-country crap) was much worse than the work we went to do.  Wes was being a dick to my mom today.  He doesn't do that often, at least not around me.  I think he's officially decided that he has 100% control of her mind.  I don't think I can doubt him on that.  My mom used to be her own person, but I guess you need a 50yr old man with an infected ass and a bottle of viagra to look up to these days.  Speaking of 50yr old men, John sent me quite an interesting comment from a chatroom:     why do girls have to have a pic to be proven female??    Because this is the internet.    Unless proven otherwise, you are a 50yr old man with a bucket of KFC in one hand and your penis in the other.   Needless to say I laughed my ass off.  I definately needed something like that to pick me up, especially on a day like this.  Everyone needs a little shred of happiness on a day so hot, evil, musty, and old.

						   Damnit, I was in such a good mood the other day.  What happened?? How did I get into this hole in the span of a day??  Was it just that I came home to my wreched life again??  If that's the case, I want to get away again.  I woke up at 10, again.  I thought maybe staying at Jonathan's would break me out of my daily routine, but apparently not.  Thus far, that routine has been:  wake up at 10, eat, do some random work that I don't get paid for, play guitar for an hour or so, sleep from 1-4, eat, shower, talk on yahoo, blog, and go to bed at 10.  As much as I love sleep, I hate that routine.  Fifteen hours is just too much.  All I want is a change of scenery, Is that too much to ask??

						   Yesterday I went to Jonathan's house.  It was the best time I've had probably all summer long.  Jimmy was there, too.  It was suprememly awesome.  Jon and Jimmy dragged me across town, again and again.  We walked probably 3 hours.  I could tell you the whole route, but what a waste of time that would be??  The only important thing was that we went to see John Lecoque, in fact, I think it was the first time Jimmy and John were introduced.  We went bowling, too, of course we walked.  Needless to say, by the night's end, I had a serious case of chap-ass.  Oh, the pain.  After miles of walking we went to DQ.  They were closing, so Slaw got us free drinks.  That was fun.  The caffeine was definately a factor in the goodness of the night, too.  I was up at a 3 o'clock in the morning.  That's quite a rarity for me.  We were out on the porch speaking of the greater questions of the universe.  That's always a good thing to do with extra time.  It was just that much better with the amazing ambience and atmosphere of Jonathan's backyard and the back-alley feel of good ol' Clinton, Missouri.  Now, what could have made this day possibly any better.  I went to Jonathan's and saw Jimmy and Matt and Stanton, so what could be better than that??  Oh yes, It got better.  I SAW RACHEL.  That's a statment in itself.  I saw Rachel for the first time thus far this entire summer.  It was only a brief meeting, though, she left shortly with Matt and Stanton to go to the movies.  I really hate the movies, especially in a town like Clinton.  I could have went to the movies with them, but what would have been the point??  That's not a good place for conversation, that's not a place for catching up.  The movies is the kind of place you take someone that you don't want to talk to, but still want to say that you were with them.  As bad of a concept as that is, it seems to have definately hit its niche here in small-town America.  All I can say is that it was quite a good time.  Now I'm left with nothing to look forward to but Thursday.  Those plans are under question, though.  I'm amazed at how you can spend so much time with your friends, and it still goes so fast that it feels like it never happpened.

						   Today has just been too fantastic.  Mom and Wes left again, which gave me even more time to leave my room and migrate through the rest of the house.  This is always a good feeling.  Even a hermit like myself wouldn't mind a change of scenery every now and again.  Tomorrow I'm going to hang out with Jonathan, that should be good fun.  Then, next Wednesday I get to go see the dentist.  He's so awesome, we drive all the way to Marshall just to see him.  He's missing a finger, and he tells everyone he got it bit off.  I still don't think anyone knows how he did lose that finger.  Oh yeah, as if things aren't good  enough, I'm going to hang out with Rachel and Susan next Thursday.  Today I went to burn a CD and something fanastic happened.  I went to put the blank CD in the CD burner.  A few seconds passed while I opened media player.  Then, out of nowhere, this brand new CD, right off the spindle, has 30 minutes of metal on it.  It was too weird.  Like, Twillight Zone weird.  Oh yeah, the main reason I logged in and posted again is because I'm an idiot.  It turns out that the post I thought go deleted is right there.  So, if you didn't figure that out for yourself you're probably dumber than me, or you just don't pay attention.  In either case, you should just put your own opinions aside, listen to me, and vote for Ralph Nader (if you can vote, that is).  Oh yeah, go here:   urlLink votenader.org

						   Today was fantastic.  Well, it still is fantastic.  So free and beautiful and light and forgiving today is.  My mom and Wes went to Lexington, giving me the house to myself.  I really don't hate the country as much when they're not around.  I got to play loud music and dance around in the kitchen, that's always fun.  I also threw on a pot of coffee, and that always brings me up.  I made a playlist of old 90s music.  There's something great about the happy alternative of the 90s that makes a person's morale just jump up.  I listen to a lot of 90s music that doesn't fall into this category (Green Day, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc.).  So many people get deeply attached to the music they listened to when they were in high school, but high school is just so depressing, I'd rather listen to music from a simpler time in my life.  This day was so fine that I decided to open my ever-closed blinds.  When I pulled the string that opens these blinds, the whole set-up fell.  Everything, even the board that attaches to the top of the window frame came off.  I fixed it, though.  What a pick-me-up that was.  I am a genius.  That's really all I have to say for myself on this fine day.  I'll just go back to enjoying it.  Bye, Bye.  **oh yeah, and remember www.votenader.org

						   I typed out this long post to introduce myself.  I'm stupid though, and apparently I can't use my blog right, so the post is lost.  I suppose all you really need to know is that I'm a 15 year old in the sick place that is Clinton, Missouri, USA.  I actually live in the outskirts, which is worse.  I live with my mom, out in the country.  The people out there really do amaze me.  They're like those people living in suburbia, and try to make their house look like Martha Stewart's.  It's pathetic how people can just beautify the things around them and completely make themselves blind from the problems of the world.  Nobody votes anymore.  I wish I could.  People in this country complain about our government, which is completely fine.  But they don't put their voice to use either, so they have no right to complain.  They're perfectly content in complaining about the newest presidential decision at the Culligan water dispenser in their corporate workplace.  Of course, that's not so bad, at least with a job like they they can afford their 2-story in suburbia.  Everyone calls me a left-wing hippy, but, really I'm not.  People need to understand that politcis aren't made out in a straight line with a left & right.  The left & right both suck now, because they're both the same, really.  One of the reasons for starting this was to speak politically and hopefully to get everone to go out and vote for a 3rd party candidate.  My vote, if I had one, would go to Ralph Nader (www.votenader.org).

						   Hmmm...first post.  Well, I suppose it's best to introduce myself properly.  I live in Clinton, Missouri, USA.  Well, not really, it's a handful of miles out of Clinton.  That's where I got to school, though.  Well, that's where I've gone since kindergarten.  I don't really know what's going on now, I'm just really confused...but that's another story.  I live in the boonies, and I have a really dick stepdad. He's really the root of all of my troubles.  He's one of those hick people, you know, the people that listen to Toby Keith and support George Bush (evil).  He's also one of those old people, that are completely brainwashed, but want you to listen to them, because they think that intellegence/wisdom is directly connected with age.  I'm sorry, but some old people are really dumb, and still just haven't figured it out.    I live on a farm, too.  This is really bad, especially for such a lazy person as myself.  Well, I'd like to think that I'm not lazy, I just don't believe in most work, out of principal.  Most of the work I have to do is feeding horses.  How, I loathe the horses.  They have this amazing stupidity that is unmatched by any other living creature.  I always have to feed and water them, and they just take giant horse craps in their water buckets...then drink it.  Awful, awful animals.  There's really no rhyme or reason to this post.  I'm kinda just ranting.  So, I'll just backtrack and tell you all that I'm 15, and am going into the 10th grade.  As soon as summer is over, that is.  This summer has been rather bland, I must say, even for me.  I've made a stride to move in with my father, because he's uber-cool.  I don't think I can leave my friends, though.  Friends are the most important part of life as far as I'm concerned.  I think I should probably close.  I could talk for much, much longer.  Perhaps I should write an autobiography??  That's a ponderable thought.  Well, I'm going to close with a little propaganda, there's nothing hippy without a little politics.  Here you go:  "Everyone vote for Ralph Nader.  (www.votenader.org)"

						   Today Brandon came over and we did nothing.  I came back from my dad's so that I could haul wood or something, and we didn't even end up doing it.  Yet another example of parental assdom.  I'm gonna stop complaining about it, though, because it really wasn't too bad of a deal.  I got to see Brandon for the first time in quite some time.  There was some odd tension there today, something that hasn't been so between Brandon and I for a time that I cannot place.  I don't do good with dates and times.  I got  quite a bit of guitar playing in today.  I usually do when Brandon is around.  Anyone, for that matter.  That's really all I did today, besides resorting to the xbox whilst my fingers rest.  The day went by quite fast actually, it seems like it could be morning again.  I'd think that I dreamt the whole day through if I wasn't so damned tired.  John and I are planning for him to come to my dad's house.  He downloaded Farenheit 9/11, so this will probably be my only chance to watch it until it's out on video.  That'll probably be after the election, and who wants to see it after Bush is out of office??  *prays*"Dear god, plase don't let Bush get re-elected".  Well that's it for today.  You can help the cause and vote for Ralph Nader, but I don't think anyone that reads my blog is old enough to.  Just in case, here it is:   urlLink www.votenader.org

						   It's been quite some time since I've posted.  There's been plenty to talk about.  It seems that my boring life seems to really fuck with me sometimes.  There was a fire at the lawnmower plant that dad works at, so he took a few weeks off.  I hate to say that I'm dependent on the lawn mower industry, because I truley hate it so.  Speaking of which, I mowed today, but more on that later.  There are things troubling me on this night.  It seems that my sister is too poor to live on her own in Warrensburg, so she has to move back to Omaha.  Needless to say, that sucks ass.  My sister is about the only person I can vent to, besides my dad and my friends, but it's just not the same.  To me, there's nothing better than hanging out with my sister berating pop figures and politicians.  I was going to go hang out with my sister for a few weeks before she had to move, and I suppose I still am, and great dismay to my mother.  It seems she cares much more about whether or not the yard gets mowed than whether or not I see my sister again before she leaves the state.  Well now that I'm pissed I figure it's about time to go into today's mowing fiasco.  Lets see, it started about 10 AM today.  Wes told me it was dry enough to start cutting the yard, so I started to do so.  (Keep in mind that the yard was just mowed on sunday, which would put me on a 3-day mowing schedule, that's the same schedule as the suburbian/office types that water their lawn.)  Anyways, I got the mower out checked the gas/oil and proceeded to the side yard.  I lowered the blades, because the grass was already quite short.  Then, not surprisingly, the mower died because there was still water on the grass.  Well, I came back inside, and Wes started in on the bitching.  He went and raised the blades again.  I ended up cutting the yard no more than 1/4" shorter than it already was.  The thing is, the mowing doesn't really bother me, it's just that Wes is such and ass about it.  I mean sure, I don't necessarily do a "good" job mowing, I miss patches and am just to lazy to do others, but I don't believe in mowing and I don't give a fuck about the yard.  So in all reality, what can somone expect??  In all, I got bitched at, had to get the mower out on 3 different occasions, and cut my arm all to hell on some crazy bush.  I suppose it could have been worse.  Then again, It could have been a hell of a lot better, too.  The one thing about Wes is that he tries to put on this old, tired, and wise act.  In reality he's an egotistical asshole with a god-like self-image.  Far from wise, eh??  He also spends an amazing amount of energy berating me, and going far out of his way just to put in his two cents/piss me off.  Far from old/tired, eh??  You may just thing that I'm easily annoyed, or that Wes isn't all that much worse than every other parental figured, but you'd be wrong.  He's the image of hypocracy.  Dick Cheney would strive to reach Wes's level of asshole, and George, well, he would just shit himself.  speaking of Bush, go here:   urlLink http://www.votenader.org
