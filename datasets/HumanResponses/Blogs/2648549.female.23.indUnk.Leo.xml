      I was just wondering what if  urlLink Friendster  had another feature called "chatster". In this case, any chatting-oriented programs would be at stake. By then, the guys at  urlLink Friendster  would have probably thought of creating online games. And personal websites or blogging tools (instead of just the cliché profile). And your own  urlLink Friendster  mailbox (by the way, instead of waiting for a notification in my mailbox, I'm going directly to my  urlLink Friendster  account to see if my network is expanding).  Later, an online currency (so you could buy, sell, or auction stuff while doing the routine hi-may-I-add-you-to-my-friends-list activity).  Then, an extensive user search is likely to follow (consider keywords related to "most time spent chatting", "website-award winning", "most selling items", or even "Fraudster").  With all that, we might say, "Now, who needs the Internet anymore?" Glad is not about to happen anytime soon.  I am actually waiting for the time it does not have "beta" tagging along, but "We regret to inform you that  urlLink Friendster  is no longer operating due to lack of financial support" on the screen (to make it less cynical, try this: " urlLink Friendster  is now teaming up  urlLink Yahoo!  and all free accounts will be limited to 200KB of images and 200 friends. Click here to register for a Premium Account.").  But before  urlLink Friendster  is history, I think I would just loosen up, relate to some stunning celebrities (who somehow manage to create an account despite their jam-packed schedule), and have testimonials done by cartoon characters.   [A  urlLink Friendster  user who finds delayed updates of  urlLink Friendster  is perfectly aggravating.]

      Recently, some of my fellow mailing list administrators asked a mind-boggling question (no way, I'm just exaggerating this): "Why is everyone so quiet?" Or something like: "Where are you guys? What on earth have got you occupied?" Even the desperate one: "Look at the archives...I am the only person who does the posting."  I would say, blame it on  urlLink Friendster . With the six-degree-separation theory, now those virtual-people-person are turned more to adding up their friends list, uploading and changing pictures, submitting testimonials, and of course, the favorite approving things (I bet they never reject anything unless it blatantly hurts their cyber pride). With all the privileges, who needs a mailing list anymore? I mean, that dull, no-picture, full-of-forwardings, stack of emails (don't forget the annoying attachments)?  It seems that  urlLink Friendster  has all it takes to be the heaven of I-need-some-more-guys-to-be-linked-to kind of people. Taken  urlLink FIRO theory  into consideration,  urlLink Friendster  fulfills our interpersonal needs of inclusion—the feeling of being important, accepted, wanted. It also satisfies the human need of control by giving the right to decide which one they want to be associated with of all the users. And it surely gives a way of practicing the butt-licking approach (look at all the testimonials!).  Definitely not a place to exile as what the popular saying has on internet freaks. In  urlLink Friendster , it is exactly the opposite. You do need to meet people, telling them (even those you do not personally know) it would be great to have them listed, politely offering to type what they has to say about you. What a nice life.

      This is cute.  urlLink Click here  to find out  what kind of angel you are  (girls only, cute guys are warmly welcome, though). Don't worry, dark angels are available for those who don't fit the word "angel".  Now, I proudly pronounce that I am a Warrior Angel!   (Wheww... Look at the picture. Can't imagine if I'm really dressed in that outfit. Boys, dream on! And stop the drooling...)  And here's what it says about a Warrior Angel:  "Guardian Angels are also known as Warrior Angels, because they are the army of God. Does not always mean that they are in war, simply that their job is to protect unwary humans from dark dragons, or other evil demons. Warrior Angels are not always friendly with humans, but they will watch over them all the time. Humans say that when a miracle happens, thank your guardian angel."  I love that.   [Not always friendly but protects people. Yeah right!]

      The issue of smoking, I believe, doesn't have anything to do with gender. After all, smoking is merely an activity in which you light a wrapped-nicotine and inhale the smoke coming out of it. It's just like throwing a used can outside from inside your car. Itâs not right, but it's okay.  Smoking will absolutely ruin your health, whether you're a guy or a girl. The problem is: the so-called social norms of ours consider that smoking is a guy's thing. Hence, if you're a girl, you're not supposed to smoke--not because it's dangerous for your well-being, but somewhat because it's a form of discrepancy of your femininity.  It's a good thing that our society has an aversion to smoking girls. However, we need to clarify why we are against them. Should we forbid girls from smoking, don't say because they are girls. But because there's nothing about smoking. The great feeling they have during or after smoking is only an assumption, an exclusive notion, that would bring up more troubles rather than benefits.  I don't smoke, but I have a lot of friends and relatives (from both sexes) who do. I don't mind that in one condition: they respect me when I choose not to breathe in their smoke, and, they don't sway me, in one way or another, to smoke.  So, am I for girls who smoke (excessively, especially)? Yes, when it concerns the fact that it's their privilege as a human being. And no, when it's about health--mine and theirs.   [Cliche. Who cares? I just want something to blog about anyway. And by the way, I was just babbling in terms of Indonesian culture context.]

      I am one of the fans of  urlLink Di Sini Ada Setan (DSAS) , a TV show portraying six--used to be nine--teens with an abnormal interest in supernatural phenomena. The influence was from my lil brother (one-half of his personality is that of a psycopath's, mind you). It's not that awful after all. They act naturally, funny sometimes, making the whole thing seems more like a teenage comedy rather than a horror episode.  Lately, they labeled the group "Spookybusters" (bet it was named after Ghostbusters, **LOL**). I didn't find anything odd in the beginning. But come to think of it, "Spookybusters" means that THEY are the ones who give people the creeps.  I'd say "spooky" is only acceptable for Anya, who never stops talking nonsense with her ear-wrecking tone (wonder why the ghosts appear to have no fear of her). Now that she's out of the game, it's time to put DSAS on its right track. Pak Leo, would you consider removing the letter "y"?   [Thinks that horror shows are better educators than cheesy sinetrons.]

      A week ago, I arranged an appointment with my lecturer to discuss my bachelor thesis I was working on. I could have finished it months ago, had I not been so perfectionist and idealistic. Don't blame me. It was him (my lecturer) who at first kept "criticizing" my proposal, saying that it could be much better if this and that and blah-blah-blah.  And so I was moved. Eventhough it is a descriptive study with a quantitative approach (I used questionnaires), I spent a devastating month trying to figure out a clever way of evaluating the data so it won't look that "quantitative" (too bad I cannot employ a correlative study). When I finally met him (maybe he was in a bad mood, by the way), he did not even try to read the most important chapter. He was just glancing at my precious work-of-art, skimming through the 130-something pages, and suggesting some minor changes on the table of contents. Our meeting lasted for less than 5 minutes. Voila! He said I got his full consent (well, at least he did say something).  I was dumbfounded.  "Gee...skrps v lsg di-acc.Wasn't expectd that.I'd hoped he'd comment on sth.Sdikit kcwa,thought my thesis was intrestin.Tp  alhamdulillah."  (text sent to a close friend right after)   I was hoping for a scientific conversation to follow. I was hoping he would ask me to revise some things. I was hoping he was curious to know how the categorization came to my mind. And perhaps I was hoping he would be a bit skeptical as to the simplification I brought about.  It did not happen the way I had anticipated.   [Still wonders how others can get away with shallow analysis.]

      (to be published on  urlLink C’nS Magazine , Vol.3/26, August-September 2004)  The long awaited university entrance test is drawing near. I can still remember clearly how my parents burst out in rage when I told them what major I planned to take after high school graduation. It was not hard to tell that they wanted me to take a top-notch major in a first-class university, just as they did after completing high school. On the other hand, I did not have the intention of following their footprints. I managed to stick to my plan since they would not know what I wrote on the test paper anyway (tricky, eh?).  As for me, it was a happy ending story. The major I am taking at the moment is my first choice in the university entrance test. Not an "elite" major in a leading university. But I am proud to say I am quite satisfied as to how things are going. And come to think of it, I guess I have no regrets at all—well, a few but, just as Frank Sinatra said, too few too mention.  Now, many others, or perhaps you, do not end up the way I did. Some are perhaps forced to abide by their parents’ will or to enroll to their second or third choice of university, while some might be awfully miserable for not being able to pass the test.   Well, I always believe that success does not necessarily depend on where I study or what major I take. It is my attitude that matters the most. Now wait, before you get bored with this classic rationale and turn the page. It is just a waste of time if I take a popular major but have little or no fun studying it. It is also somewhat useless if I am accepted in a well-known university but perform just as other typical students. The important thing is to be different (in a positive manner, of course).   As far as I know, there is yet a scientific research concluding alumnae of celebrated universities have greater success or contentment compared to those of others. Thinking of taking a particular major in order to get a good job easily? Then think again. Going to a top campus and taking a "superior" major might give some sense of prestige, but it does not guarantee success or even happiness. Degree or title only get you to the first step (for some people, this does not even matter). Next, give room to experiences and skills. want to go higher? Say the old adage again: attitude is of importance.  I will sidestep the Herculean task of providing examples of successful people with average educational backgrounds, but take this one. A friend of mine is a dropped-out college student. His major was not on the most-wanted list. Curious to find out what he is now? A training manager of an international hotel (the one once famous for the bombing incident). He does not have a diploma, let alone a bachelor degree. But he is now making as much money as my father—who holds a bachelor degree from a respected university—makes in a month just by training other people for less than a half day.  How can that be? To cut a long story short, he knows what he wants and is not easily influenced by what other people say. He keeps an eye on opportunities, dares to be different, to take challenges and risks, and eventually, reaps the fruit of his endeavor.  Then again my friends, what matters is not where you study or what major you take. You possibly put your mental health at stake if you force yourself to learn subjects you are not really interested in. Likewise, there’s no point of being a student of a favorite university if you spend more time lying down the couch than doing worthy activities. As long as you work hard enough, knowing that you have tried your best in just about everything you do, and refuse to be a "common person", you are on the right track.  And no, this is not my way of justifying things for you. You are free to, and must, pursue any education track you yearn for. The gist of hundreds of words you have been reading just now is that whatever you decide for your college life is something you have to live up to the next four years, and even more. It is by far not like typing a word in Microsoft Word and undo it the next minute. So think wisely, do not rely merely on what other people or your ego might say. If you have finally come up with the decision, stick to it. And if you fail, simply make the most of what you have, instead of thinking the grass is greener on the other side of your fence.   Some of you get what you want now—going to the school or university you always dream of. Good for you. But for those who don’t, remember to always change the things you can and accept those which you cannot.

      Saya akan bicara kebebasan. Menantang anak-anak didik saya untuk berbeda pendapat dengan buku pelajaran. Mereka bebas membuat tema tulisan. Bebas memilih objek gambar. Bebas menentukan lagu untuk dinyanyikan. Bebas minum dan makan permen selama belajar. Bebas untuk lima menit istirahat pendek setiap 60 menit jam pelajaran. Bebas untuk keluar dari kelas jika materi ajaran saya tidak bermanfaat.  Saya akan bicara tanggung jawab. Karenanya, saya harus membaca dan memahami lebih banyak daripada yang saya uraikan. Lebih dari sekadar mengerti karena saya harus membantu orang lain memahami. Bahwa apapun yang dilakukan adalah pilihan yang punya konsekuensi. Bahwa tidak bisa lagi menyalahkan sekolah, kurikulum, orang tua, jika gagal atau menemui kesulitan. Bahwa lebih baik mandiri dengan hasil sekadarnya daripada mengandalkan salinan PR atau contekan jawaban.  Saya akan bicara keadilan. Memberi kesempatan sama pada tiap siswa untuk berpendapat, menjawab, atau membantah. Tidak menatap baris depan atau baris belakang saja. Tidak hanya bertanya pada beberapa orang yang sudah saya hafal namanya. Tidak hanya menyebut-nyebut siswa yang paling cerdas. Punya arsip nilai yang lengkap dan transparan yang siap ditunjukkan—dan dipertanggungjawabkan.  Saya akan bicara kesejajaran. Bahwa dengan berada di depan kelas bukan berarti saya yang paling tahu atau paling bisa. Bahwa setiap sekolah adalah sama; tidak penting di mana, tetapi bagaimana mereka bersekolah.  Saya akan bicara tentang menghargai. Tidak ada cemoohan saat siswa tidak bisa atau salah menjawab. Menunggu dengan sabar ketika ada yang bicara terbata-bata. Menyebut setiap siswa dengan namanya. Menulis hal yang menarik tentang setiap karangan sebelum saya membagikannya kembali.   Saya akan bicara motivasi, karena pendidikan bukanlah pengajaran apalagi pelatihan. Memberi keyakinan bahwa setiap orang diberi Tuhan potensi yang sebanding.   Saya akan bicara tentang menyukai. Kerelaan untuk belajar dan berpikir tanpa paksaan. Hingga anak-anak didik saya tidak sabar menunggu saat kembali ke sekolah setelah sampai di rumah. Dan karenanya saya perlu permainan setiap hari. Senyum, tawa, dan juga variasi alat bantu ketika mengajar—tidak melulu dengan ceramah atau OHP.   Saya akan bicara pemahaman, bukan hafalan. Susunan kalimat sendiri dengan kekurangan di sana-sini adalah lebih indah daripada kata-kata rumit yang tak dimengerti. Hingga anak-anak didik saya akan lebih senang essai daripada pilihan ganda. Atau ujian lisan daripada tulisan. Tak sebatas teori tapi tahu gunanya ketika mereka tak lagi di bangku sekolah.  Saya akan bicara prioritas. Karena tidak mungkin semua materi dapat dipahami penuh dengan begitu banyaknya bidang studi. Mendorong mereka yang mampu untuk mengikuti komunitas belajar yang tidak cuma menerapkan rumus instan.  Saya akan bicara tentang membantu. Mungkin telepon rumah saya sering berdering karena banyak siswa yang belum paham proses respirasi. Mungkin saya harus rajin memeriksa kotak e-mail untuk berdiskusi lebih dalam dengan anak didik saya tentang revolusi industri. Mungkin rumah saya kerap dikunjungi mereka yang tidak bisa memecahkan soal logaritma. Mungkin telepon selular saya penuh pesan SMS, menanyakan pola Past Perfect Continuous Tense. Dan mungkin makan siang saya di ruang guru selalu terganggu karena mesti menjelaskan kembali rumus gerak lurus berubah beraturan. Tetapi saya senang bisa membantu.  Dan saya harus punya pekerjaan lain yang bisa menopang kehidupan saya karena negara tempat saya tinggal belum bisa menghargai profesi guru sebagaimana mestinya. Saya tidak ingin jadi kaya raya. Saya hanya ingin menyiapkan bahan ajaran tanpa perut melilit. Ingin rutin berlangganan minimal satu surat kabar lokal agar tak ketinggalan berita. Ingin membeli paling tidak satu buku tiap bulan supaya selalu punya hal baru untuk dibagi dengan anak-anak didik saya.   Itu kalau saya jadi guru—yang mungkin seperti banyak orang lain, menjadi alternatif terakhir bila tak juga mendapat pekerjaan.

      I was awaken in one cold early morning. And suddenly took notice of a barely audible sound of a television not turned off—a criminal show produced by one of the local TV stations once famous for its news programs. The topic that day, labeled a special edition, was on strippers (nightclub strippers, for sure).  Apart from the shallow "investigation" presented, I was wondering as to why the life of two strippers interviewed for the program was packed in a format similar to that of murder, robbery, or kidnap? Is becoming a stripper a crime? Then why celebrated dangdut singers who also often demonstrate the same dance can still be called "artists", while these two were considered "criminals"?  Some say, of course they are different. They dress differently. When you are a dangdut singer exposed on TV, your stage outfit will somehow look more "elegant", more glamorous, and of course it should be "special" (perhaps custom-made by distinguished fashion designers). And you really sing. Not just dance. Songs will not be hip without dances, after all.  Ridiculous excuses (excuses are like a**; everybody has one). The fact is what those dangdut singers put on is pretty much a dead ringer for that of the two strippers. Except for the see-through cloth made into a long dress or blouse. Sometimes it's super tight and super short as well (thank God it's seldom skin-colored). Not to mention the super lengthy side-slit. Or is it erotic attire just a pair of bra and thong?  I suddenly bore in mind some letters to the editor of a local newspaper, regarding a dangdut program portraying three well-known singers. The writers claimed to despise songs they originally liked simply because they can't stand the singers' costume. They said that with certain movements, the costume "accidentally" put parts-of-adults-body-improper-for-an-under-9-pm-show on view.   The way those singers move is actually just as indecent as that of the two strippers featured in the criminal program I mentioned at the start of this post. And dangdut singers not only sing, but creating such "arousing" sounds which are not words. If we just try to be honest, the impact is somewhat more harmful since they can be heard without having to deliberately look at them. To make it worse, those erotic-packed-in-music programs are placed in family-time slots, not late at night the way criminal programs are aired.  The bottom line is that those dangdut singers are celebrities, and deserve the highlights of infotainment programs. While these two strippers are nobody, minions, who are prone to criminal litigation at anytime.  It seems that we tend to find excuses more easily and be more lenient towards celebrities. Whatever they do, as long as they are the so-called public figures, they remain admired, or perhaps, worshipped. Their negative behaviors—even those punishable by law—can still be commented nonchalantly, "What can you say? Celebrities will be celebrities."   Before the laws are amended, only those who clearly exhibit the most private parts of their body can be charged. Nevertheless, don’t we have moral ethics? Can we comfortably hide behind the notion that eroticism is something ambiguous?  It’s about time that we cast some fairness and wisdom over the things we say and do. But for the time being, I guess it’s much better to be a celebrity...   [No, actually don't wanna be one...]

      Jujur, saya terkejut ketika beberapa waktu lalu mendengar teriakan-teriakan ala senior ospek di reality show besutan salah satu stasiun televisi. Saya pikir dua belas orang akademia angkatan ke-3 itu sedang mengikuti outbond training atau apalah, bersama panitia. Ternyata suara-suara keras yang menurut saya tidak pada tempatnya itu justru meluncur dari mulut para akademia angkatan sebelumnya.  Saya pernah dikerjai seperti itu. Berpegangan dengan rekan di depan dan di belakang saya dengan mata tertutup, untuk kemudian dikondisikan seperti sedang melewati berbagai rintangan. Harus lompat atau merunduk padahal tidak ada selokan, genangan air, atau cabang pohon yang menjuntai. Tetapi karena tidak ada nada-nada memerintah atau marah, saya jadi lebih yakin ketika itu saya sedang berada di pinggiran desa dekat hutan. Semuanya dijalani dengan semangat "lelucon".  Lain dengan apa yang saya saksikan di ajang popularitas tersebut. Ketika menyusuri jalan menuju lokasi karantina—bahkan setelah sampai dalam ruangan, para akademia baru seolah selalu melakukan kesalahan dan mesti “dibimbing” dengan hardikan yang menurut saya tidak wajar. Parahnya lagi, senior-senior mereka tampak begitu menikmati suasana itu. Bahkan tidak jarang setelah membentak, mereka menatap kamera sambil tersenyum atau menampakkan wajah lucu. Seakan-akan apa yang mereka lakukan menghibur.  Keluarga saya tertawa-tawa kecil menyaksikan adegan-adegan yang lebih mirip akademi militer itu. "Toh cuma skenario. Nggak beneran.", elak mereka. Memang, sesudah "skenario" itu berakhir, mereka pun saling berlomba memberi ucapan selamat sekaligus minta maaf.  Kita seringkali berlindung di balik kata "maaf", atau "pura-pura". Padahal, pernahkah para akademia senior atau panitia yang memperbolehkan kejutan itu mempertimbangkan perasaan atau mencoba memosisikan diri sebagai akademia baru? Apakah dua belas akademia yang menurut saya tertindas itu memang rela diperlakukan demikian atas nama hiburan? Mungkin.  Paling tidak ini mengisyaratkan dua hal. Pertama, dengan kekuasaan, apalagi jika didukung jumlah massa, akan cenderung membuat kita mudah memperlakukan orang lain semena-mena, terlepas dari ada atau tidaknya skenario. Saya melihat dengan jelas betapa merasa berkuasanya para senior di acara tersebut ketika mereka dengan leluasa mempermainkan "junior-junior" mereka. Betul-betul lain dengan mimik muka mereka ketika mendapat teguran dari pengajar atau panitia saat masa karantina dulu. Saya jadi berpikir, boleh jadi ada sisi bawah sadar yang membuat mereka ingin "membalas dendam" atas perlakuan tidak enak yang pernah mereka terima. Sebuah euforia kebebasan.  Ke dua, yang harus lebih dalam dipertimbangkan, adalah dampaknya bagi siapapun yang kebetulan melihat tayangan tersebut. Siswa-siswi kelas 2 atau 3 SMP/SMU akan terinspirasi untuk memarahi adik-adik kelasnya saat masa orientasi siswa. Para mahasiswa senior pun bisa jadi makin merasa tindakan bentak-membentak itu sudah sepantasnya dilakukan. Toh cuma skenario.   Skenario yang dilakukan atas dasar melatih mental atau kekompakan. Dua alasan yang menurut saya sama tak masuk akalnya. Kondisi mental yang tangguh tidak bisa dilatih hanya dalam tempo dua-tiga hari. Buat saya, tempaan yang lebih mengena bukan pada masa ospek, tetapi justru selama kuliah. Pun, kekompakan lahir dengan sendirinya selama karantina—bukan lewat penindasan pura-pura.   Baguslah jika perlakuan macam itu tetap dipandang sebagai skenario. Tetapi jangan lupa, kadangkala kita menerjemahkan skenario ini pada kehidupan nyata. Diakui atau tidak, hal tersebut membawa pengaruh pada kebiasan "gencet-menggencet"—yang tidak jarang dilakukan senior pada juniornya yang dianggap menyebalkan, belagu, atau tidak penurut. Bila stressing masih tetap perlu, tak bisakah dicari bentuk lain yang lebih intelek? Kritikan pedas juri terhadap kemampuan teknis menyanyi, menari, atau performa panggung lainnya, misalnya. Namun pada akhirnya, format perploncoan di salah satu kontes popularitas tersebut memang menghibur. Hiburan yang mengerikan.

      What is thriller actually? What is with this genre? Or is it a genre after all? Horror? Blood? Death? Terror? Mysticism? Psychopath?  Let's just say that this post is about violence, mortality, and cold-blooded murderer—no matter what the categorization is. My little brother (a 12-grader, by the way) is a massive fan of such movies. So am I. With an exception that he likes them in a much higher degree than I do. To make it short, he's able to see any sadistic movie available—while eating, if necessary (well,  urlLink Faust  is not included).  Does that mean he's cold, rude, and even twisted?  For more than 16 years of living under the same roof, I have never seen him caught in criminal problems whatsoever. He seldom uses coercive approach either. And I proudly say that he’s worth the nomination of The Nicest Brother in Indonesian Little Bro Competition (if any).   Do bloodshed-oriented shows have the so-called catharsis function? The channeling of desires and fantasies?   The afore-mentioned statement, I believe, needs to be scientifically proven further. I only agree that everyone has so many sides inside of him. The childlike side. The adult side. And the psychopathy. Whereas behavioral psychology suggests that human mind is initially empty and can be loaded with any conditioning system, I tend to think that we were readily born with complete variations of characters. It is only a matter of personal choices and external influences that some advance than the others.   Then again, let us leave this endless debate to psychologists (and perhaps philosophers). One thing for sure, whether a movie is "educating" or merely exposing cruelty can be judged from the plot of the story.  urlLink Silence of the Lambs ,  urlLink The Watcher  (although Keanu Reeves is somehow too "sweet" to be a psycho),  urlLink The Bone Collector ,  urlLink Phone Booth , are more intellectually stimulating than  urlLink Jason X ,  urlLink Halloween , or  urlLink Freddy vs. Jason . Yes, they all slaughter. However, brainy movies does not rely on blood-splattered-scenes or human mutilation as the center of the story. It is about cunning efforts of revealing the criminal, enforcing justice, and survival spirit. This means, we ought to outsmart the bad guys.   These kinds of movies are not always lead to aggressive messages. Stephen King's  urlLink Dreamcatcher , for example. Some gore sights are there but the friendship touch is easily found. Even  urlLink Hannibal  occasionally depicts Lecter's "human" side.  urlLink Natural Born Killers  is of the extremes—at least, it employs a different stance which comes from the point of view of the executioner.  It is a pity that some still put brutality and terror in front.  urlLink Texas Chainsaw Massacre  could be a success without detail visualization of distasteful torturing scenes.  urlLink American Psycho  fails to bring in fear, unless some of the illogical settings were removed.  urlLink Swimfan  too, would be much better to enjoy if only the editors paid more attention to their job.   Lastly, seeing movies on people butchery does not always entertain. Going to movies is an entertainment, but we don't necessarily take the obligation to smile, giggle, or laugh afterwards. And fierce movies are probably not attended to on account of their maliciousness.  urlLink Valentine ,  urlLink Scream , and  urlLink I Know What You Did Last Summer  are more like babes and hunks line-ups than movies about killing or being killed. Perhaps my little brother fancies  urlLink Kill Bill  as a result of his devotion to Uma Thurman?

      I am fully aware that life by all means is not meant to be easy. It is not life unless it is chock-full of options where we must choose and thus, sometimes make the wrong decisions. But still, I have no clue as to why, with all the difficulties life has upon us, people keep on making it harder than it should be, or already is.   I just realize this when I try to count how many demands I have in life. Demands made by people just like me. Imagine this. Before my school years the demand was, "When will you go to school?". After I went to school, it turned into, "When will you graduate?". Following the graduation, came this, "When will you get a job?". Okay, now I got a job, but, "When will you be promoted?"—or worse, "When will you get married?". Finally, met a man of my dream before the problem, "When will you have children?". Later, repeat from question number one with a different subject—my kids.  Gee...how tiring, wearing, exhausting—keeping up with all the demands in life. Answering people's question to make them happy. Why don't they just ask, "When will you be out of this world?". At least I won't have to come up with the response.  Can't I just sit back and relax and enjoy what God has given to me without worrying what I might not have achieved? Can't they (whoever they are) just stop comparing me with others so that I won’t look so...incomplete?  I suppose it would be a lot nicer if I could turn back and be grateful for what or where I had been instead of looking way ahead and thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the fence (yikes, I bring this up again).   [We will never be truly complete anyway. We can only try to be, or seem to be.]

      Around December this year? And would like to take me along? :)   Nope, it's not a request. Just a hope as my other half is going to be there from October until January. And come to think of it, it's going to be our very first time being so far away from each other. Well, he is still somewhere in Asia. However, this time we won't be able to see each other’s face or hear each other's voice. **sobs** At least no during the three months since it would be a waste of time to fly to Bandung once in two weeks just as he usually did. A waste of time and a waste of money.  There you go. Gone are my days of pointlessly waiting for his surprise calls and visits.  Anyways, it's the consequence of having a long-distance relationship. I seldom think it would be hard because I barely live through it. Then again, I am thankful the plan is set after I graduated (plus hopefully-enough weeks to get a job and be preoccupied). Now that it's just two months away, let us see how we’re going to make it.   [Fervently looking for a job.]

      This is cool. Unicorn has been my all-time favorite myth unit...I mean, beast (sorry, being carried away with  urlLink Age of Mythology ). Then there’s this quiz to determine which myth unit...I mean, beast, suits you most.  urlLink It’s here . Go and try it.  Did the quiz and got this on my first try.    And here's something about Unicorns...in case you're dying to know. :)  You are a Unicorn! Unicorns are pure, innocent, magestic creatures that have a spiraling white horn growing out of their forehead, and a white graceful, horses body. Unicorns represent the sign of purity, innocence, friendship, healing, rejeventation, and truth. Your horn is rare prized, but you tend to be naive, lured by a child's cry. Unicorns are reare, beautiful ans shy mythical creatures, and you are lucky to be one.   [Always know I AM lucky and am grateful for that.]

      It's been a while since my last post. Got preoccupied by job-searching activities to support my life with. Anyone have a vacancy? :)  In the mean time, I think I'd just share something I wrote for my significant other. Enjoy, and comment if you wish.   THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE   (Avianti Yulianita F)   The ease when I am weary The sentry when it's all scary The warmth when I am freezing The way out when it's all confusing The sunshine on a cloudy day The rainbow chasing the rain away The twinkling nova shimmers the most leading me home when I am lost The hope when it's all gloomy That is what you are to me Without you my soul would have less worth  So thank you for being my angel on Earth   (published in  urlLink Eternal Portraits Series )
