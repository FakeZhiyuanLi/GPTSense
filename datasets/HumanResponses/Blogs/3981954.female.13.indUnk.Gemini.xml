       I had a bad day today! ............... I found out that my grandpa might die soon! ...... Hes been sick for a looong time and I know it would probably just be best if he did but I dont wanna lose him cause hes still family and I love him .... He cant eat ne more he has to have his food through a tube thingy in his stomach (that he always takes out) and he can read and hes smart and stuff but he cant really pay attention or understand ne thing like he can talk to someone and have a conversaion he alwasy changes the subject every 5 minutes and he doesnt rememeber everyone and stuff like that and its horrible and my mom says that he might die soon and Im really mad (not just sad) about that because last year I had one person die in my family then after that her dad then her mom then my other grandma and Im scared that if one person dies again then a lot of people are gonna die I dont want another half of my family to leave me!!  I already feel alone in my house (another story)  and I dont want to feel even more lonely cause it really sucks!!  I know it may be best if he gos but then again in my mind it wouldnt!
