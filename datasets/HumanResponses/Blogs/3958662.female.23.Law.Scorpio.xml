       urlLink    View of the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn from the FDR Drive on our drive down to TriBeCa  urlLink    At Cooking by the Book with our souvenir aprons!  urlLink    Salad with Portabella Piccata  urlLink    Chicken with couscous & goat cheese flan and zucchini salad  urlLink    Molten chocolate cake (this was our 3 course meal at Cooking by the Book)  urlLink     Our firm had a summer event at Cooking by the Book this past Thursday, where we all got together and were instructed on how to cook various parts of a three-course meal. It was a fun (albeit expensive for the firm) event, and we got souvenir aprons and recipe booklets. There were some really good recipes there - I just want to know what I can substitute for heavy cream in some of the recipes. I was on the dessert team (what a surprise...).  But the cooking event got me wondering... whether food always tastes better when it's made by someone else. After all, I've always thought that sandwiches and salads taste better when someone else makes them. I could make sandwiches with the same ingredients as they use at Subway, but it probably won't taste quite the same. (For example, I had a turkey & provolone cheese sandwich today with tomatoes, onions, sweet peppers, oregano, spinach, and mustard on Italian herb and cheese bread... it was quite good, but I'm sure my making it wouldn't taste as good.) Same goes for salads. And most other dishes too, it seems. At Cooking by the Book, we did some of the cooking ourselves, but since it's a highly controlled event, we didn't really do "all" the cooking by ourselves... that must be why it still tasted so good. :)  The salad was very basic, and the portabella piccata was... interesting.  It wasn't bad, but I probably won't try that one myself.  The chicken was good, but maybe a little too many spices, and too much ginger for my liking. (I'm glad I wasn't on the chicken team because I am so not into ginger!) The couscous and goat cheese flan was my favorite part of the whole dinner - I would love to make this again, I just need a substitute for the cream! The zucchini salad was also quite good, I could go for that again. :) And the dessert... well... it's hard to have a bad molten chocolate cake. ;)  All in all, I feel so lucky that it's been another excellent food week. I've had lunches at Aquavit, Vong, Bukhara Grill, and the Friars Club... dinners at Daniel and the Cooking by the Book event... yum. :)

It was about my upcoming week, how there's little time left, my office, and my day. I'll elaborate more another time. :)

      I'm currently watching the only part of the Democratic Convention I wanted to see: Bill and Hillary. I would probably be okay with watching John Edwards too, but I really have no interest in the rest of the Convention. I miss Bill Clinton. Why can't we have 8 more years of Bill Clinton? :( He's such a charismatic President. I miss him. Compare Bill Clinton with the current dumb*ss in office - there  is  no comparison. 8 more years of Bill! (I wish.)

      Spent a lot of time today at Shoprite sans iPod. In that time period, I read:    US Weekly (cover to cover)  People Magazine (cover to cover)  Marie Claire (cover stories)  Cosmopolitan (half)  TV Guide (the color pages)   I've learned all about Lindsay Lohan and Wilmer Valderrama's romance (and how they were previously "friends with benefits"... TMI), Britney's smoking and tons of PDA with her fiance at the hotel in Marina del Rey (ugh), the Prada party and Mischa Barton wearing a $4000 dress to Taco Bell and having a fight with her rich boyfriend, Orlando and Kate (so cute! and so's the dog), Keira and her model guy, Paris Hilton's skirt blowing up in the wind, SATC fights, Angie Harmon's daughter, Sarah Jessica Parker's pretty dress, the Coach charity party... I have celebrity gossip coming out of my ears. I also read 3 issues of old People Magazines in the past 2 days, combined with the People crosswords and two New York magazine crosswords. Lots and lots of heavy reading - don't you agree? :)

      The last day I wrote, I was all set to write a post about mosquitoes. I read some other blogs and was quite amused that&nbsp;the most recent posts for at least two other people were about mosquitoes.&nbsp; But when I got to the Blogger page, I completely forgot what I was going to write about. Poor mosquitoes. No. Not really.  I went to a BBQ/clambake at a partner's house on Thursday, and got devoured by mosquitoes. Yes, it was partially my fault for forgetting bug repellent. But I wasn't the only non-DEET wearer! Yet I was the one being bitten alive. I don't know what they could have liked about me... I'm not that attractive. My mom sent me an article today about how mosquitoes will fly up to 40 miles for "a meal." Gross. I am not "a meal." Eww.  I have a huge swollen mosquito bite on my left arm, and five smaller bites on my right upper arm and shoulder. (In fact, four of the five are on my shoulder. Either the mosquitoes hit all at once and had a feast, or the same mosquito went crazy.)&nbsp;The day of the BBQ my ankles and calves wouldn't stop itching. Talking to me at the BBQ after a few hours was an exercise in trying not to laugh. My arms were flailing, my fingers were scratching, and my body looked like it was having a seizure. It was ridiculous. Yet somehow, according to one of my classmates, the mosquitoes were "swarming" around me. Gross. I think they could sense that I'm afraid of insects! I'm going to be marked with red bumps for days longer.  I knew there was a reason I didn't like going outdoors at night in the woods with exposed skin. Now I've paid my dues -&nbsp;I've got the war wounds to prove it. Just have to be on the lookout to make sure I don't get West Nile...

      We've spent a fair amount of time at work the past week figuring out celebrities we think are hot, gorgeous, cute, etc.&nbsp; (The guys with pictures posted right now are Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Adam Brody, Michael Vartan, and Ben McKenzie. Mmm. On the baseball side, I'd also like to vote for Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez,&nbsp; Mariano Rivera, Mike Mussina...) It occurred to me at one point that I had no clue who men thought were hot/cute besides the people I had mentioned thus far (Keira Knightley, Jennifer Garner, Katie Holmes, Kristin Davis), and no one was coming up with any more, so I went to the askmen.com "Top 99 Most Desirable Women in the World" list. Amusing. Anyway, who do you think belongs on the Hot List?

      After a 2+ hour debacle getting home in the rain today and feeling more than a little exhausted, I collapsed after a sushi dinner in the living room and proceeded to watch 3 hours of Stargate on the Sci-Fi Channel. It was excellent. Perfect for a Friday night when the rain won't stop and the week has been extremely draining and all you want to do is escape and sleep. (I still ache from bowling!)  People always seem a little amazed that I'm as into science fiction television and movies as I am. One of my favorite series was Star Trek: TNG, and for that reason (and MXC), I happen to watch some Spike TV. (Which is also why I object to it being "Television for Men," as I watch more Spike TV than I do Lifetime, "Television for Women." What's with the gender labeling?) I watched DS9 and Voyager over the years, and even gave Enterprise a shot, but it started conflicting with other shows and I couldn't suspend reality enough to believe that this ship could really be before Captain Kirk.  I remember watching the movie "Stargate" and liking it, and then we watched it in Spanish class (in Spanish) which was interesting. And then SG-1 came out, and now Atlantis. SG-1 reminds me a lot of TNG. Charismatic captain, fun missions... there's definitely differences between the shows but I find it has a similar energy. I haven't seen both episodes of Atlantis yet (missed half of the first). I do like it, but I think, as of right now, I prefer SG-1. Atlantis reminds me a lot of DS9 in the sense that they have a "space station" feel. There's a lot of room for family stories (not a bad thing if done right) and different stories, so that they (Atlantis and SG-1) don't feel like clones. But anyway, both were good tonight, so that made me happy.  One of the more amusing commercial segments tonight: an advertisement for something (I think Goodyear tires) with Patrick Stewart as the voice-over followed by a trailer for "Thunderbirds" directed by Jonathan Frakes. Nice. :)

      I'm listening to Sarah McLachlan's "Adia" on my new iPod. It needs a name.  Love  my new iPod. :) It's only been a few hours, but I've been loving it since before I got it.  I'm trying to assemble a list of my favorite songs. I don't have many on it so far. I love so many songs that it's hard to narrow down to "favorites." And hard to remember which ones I forgot to list! So far I have:  Sarah McLachlan - I Will Remember You (the non-live version) Savage Garden - Affirmation Billy Joel - We Didn't Start the Fire Alphaville - Forever Young Josh Groban - To Where You Are Chantal Kreviazuk - Feels Like Home Savage Garden - Truly Madly Deeply  What else should be on the list?  In other news, I left work early today and decided to work from home instead. Yoga and a Taco Bell break made me happy. Not sure what's going on this weekend yet, even though it's almost here. It's unfortunate that it takes me so long to travel back and forth to the city because I feel like it's really limiting my social options. Sigh.

      To celebrate my parents' upcoming anniversary, I took them out to dinner at Union Square Cafe tonight. Here's some pictures of the food... my favorite dish from tonight was the tuna tartare appetizer. Unfortunately I didn't remember to take pictures until I had already carved it all up! &nbsp;  urlLink   &nbsp; I'm out of practice with my instant food picture taking at restaurants (due to my work lunches). Here's the remnants of an excellent "yellowfin tuna tartare with horseradish-mustard vinaigrette, vidalia onions, and avocado salad." The other is fried calamari with spicy anchovy mayonnaise. Both were excellent. Then again I'm an "appetizer person."    urlLink     A blurry pictures of my tuna tartare... but it gives an idea of what it looked like when it was a perfect circle. It was so good!    urlLink     Seared wild salmon with spinach, corn, and shiitake mushrooms (left off the balsamic butter... which I tried on the side but it was salty and way too buttery for my taste!).   urlLink     Seared red snapper with tomato vinaigrette and some other stuff (Daddy's entree).    urlLink     Grilled marinated Filet Mignon of Tuna with Gingered Vegetables and Wasabi Mashed Potatoes (hidden by the tuna) (Mommy's entree).   urlLink     Desserts! &nbsp;  urlLink     Warm chocolate chip cake with raspberry sorbet (supposed to be cherry vanilla ice cream) and cherry compote   urlLink     The cake was soooooo good!   urlLink     Peach, raspberry and plum sorbets    urlLink     Mmmmm sorbet.... I love peach.   urlLink     At the restaurant    urlLink     Happy 34th Anniversary!    urlLink     The 3 of us    urlLink     Wow, that cake got devoured!    urlLink     Inside the dining room   urlLink     Yummy desserts are GONE :)    urlLink     Leaving Union Square Cafe... till next time!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Seafood tanks at HSF in Chinatown (Why did I write medicine tanks when I first started writing the caption?) Lots of choices.&nbsp; urlLink    &nbsp; Choices, choices. Lots of choices to be made in the next few weeks. Corporate or litigation? iPod regular or iPod mini? (Decision being made as we speak.) Where to go to lunch in the remaining three weeks? Life is all about choices. (Stating the obvious.) I still hold to my philosophy that whatever happens is what is supposed to happen, and that ultimately things will turn out to be the best choices. There is a reason for everything. Of course, this is more about the big choices, not whether or not I should get the special edition of Manchurian Candidate on DVD. &nbsp; So far today, I've been to Best Buy, where I bought Katie Holmes's "Pieces of April." I wanted to see that last year (it was last year, right?) and never got around to it, and it was only $10. Best Buy is out of iPods (15 gb), and different stores are selling them for different prices! But they're all out of stock anyway. Best Buy is one of my favorite stores. Love it there. :) &nbsp; Anyway, what are the essential DVDs one needs for a good collection?

      Well, that seemed awfully simple for a first post. (Simple to post, simple to read.)&nbsp;I've decided to make the leap from Xanga to Blogger mostly because I am sort of a Google groupie. (How can you not&nbsp;be?)&nbsp;So, after having a blog that (almost) no one knew about (it was sort of the "I won't deny it if you find it and ask but I won't tell you of my own volition so have fun searching" type), I think it's time to make a change. So here I am. :)  &nbsp;  This is not a private journal or a confessional, so if you don't know me (or even if you do) and are looking for juicy details of my life, you probably won't find them here. (Are there really any "juicy details" to my life?) Also, if you've read Doris Lessing's "The Golden Notebook," you probably understand a little more of what this means to me. This is just one notebook with which I will document my life. I haven't yet defined the contours of what it will be, but since the boundaries of a notebook often change over time, perhaps it's better that way. ;-)  &nbsp;  With all that said, hopefully the logistics are now out of the way and with that disclaimer done, I can get things started when I'm a little more awake. (Maybe?) Good night!

      It's over... even though I already knew the result, since my insatiable curiosity sent me to  urlLink athens2004.com  to find out who won the men's gymnastics team finals back when they were just finishing up airing the pommel horse. (The problem with tape-delayed events...)  Watching the Japanese men on the high bar was absolutely thrilling. They are so talented... and so fun to watch.  It was exciting watching the Japanese on the high bar, the Chinese on the pommel horse, the Romanians on the rings, and the Americans on the parallel bars... and South Korea, well, we never saw them on TV (here... unless they were on before I got home from the gym).  I love watching gymnastics... I just have no talent of my own. ;-)  Hahaha... Bob Costas just used the word "indefatigable." Nice.

      I always say I'm not going to watch much of the Olympics, but I pretty much get sucked into watching all of it (that I can).  I love watching the Chinese men's gymnastics team.  And the Japanese.  And for days now, all I've talked about is how unfortunate it is that that poor Chinese man can't compete for the gold on the pommel horse.  His routine was  hot  today.  Poor man. He's like my favorite, solely because of the pommel horse. Haha.  Watching swimming is pretty exciting too. :)  I'm just upset that I keep missing all the synchronized diving! I love Olympic diving!

      For half an hour, the news anchors and reporters today were entertained by the sight of a small watercraft going round and round in a circle somewhere out near Jamaica Bay. Apparently, the operator had fallen out or been thrown from the boat (he's okay), and the boat went around in a circle for about half an hour. (I have no idea how it stayed in that circle pattern...) The local news provided updates every 10 minutes so viewers could also watch the boat go round in circles. It was almost sad that the Coast Guard stopped it, so that it spoiled their fun. Ha. If I find a link to the story at some future date, I'll add it to the post. It was really entertaining while I cleaned junior high school papers out of a box. I threw away my copy of the test questions from the October 1994 PSAT - are you proud of me? ;-)  Also... is it bad that I felt happier leaving the dentist than I did leaving my haircut?

      Well... I went for my haircut this morning, and it's shorter than I would have liked. (Every time except the first time I got it cut in this style, it's been a little too short.) The worst part is that there's nothing I can do about it except wait until I grows out. It's too short to put it all back, and when I put part of it back, it's either too short or it sticks straight up in the air. What can I say... it's very attractive.

      I'm really bright.  At Walgreens today, I bought a giant "bonus size" bag of Starburst, and have overindulged in chewy candy, forgetting that I have a  dentist appointment  tomorrow afternoon! Dammit! That was completely illogical.  Almost as illogical as cancelling one seat on an operational flight because of weather. What's wrong with me??

      I learned the phrase "blackberry winter" last night from my AWADmail email, and I think it's really pretty. (Supposedly, it means a time during spring where it gets as cold as winter again.)  I don't want to write my IP paper. I don't even have a topic yet. But I am back to work at my Continental letter. Whee. I took yesterday off, and instead went through lots of files, threw out lots of paper (such a cleansing feeling!), and watched the Olympics. Poor Chinese man who messed up on the horse - I felt so bad for him. Didn't do much else yesterday besides drown my sorrows by shopping at Filene's Basement and dining on enchiladas. (I've agonized over this sentence: can someone grammar check it for me? And not using Word...)  Back to the letter... you can tell I wanted to post even though I had nothing to say, and my entire crafting ability is going toward the letter (so this doesn't sound like such a well-written post... not that the rest were either, but ... you know what I mean).  urlLink Best Buy  has a  hot  2 for $15 sale - I'm excited. It was 3 for $20 last week, but these movies are better choices. Yay! I am  such  a DVD addict. :)

      Despite the optimism of my last flight update, I am at home and not in Pittsburgh.  It's a very long story... I can tell you about the woman who shouted at me, "you don't gotta know my name! What you gotta know my name for??" and the supervisor who refused to look me in the eye as she told me that one seat on a plane was cancelled due to weather, even though the flight was going to be leaving. The story just might take awhile, and right now, I'm drafting it into a letter. I think I've filled my "bad customer service" quota for the month - can I have it easy for the rest of August now? Please?  This I know for sure... Continental is going to hear it from me.

      I have now used more of the personalized stationery I got from work while at home after work than I did during work. Oops.    Flight Update  : My flight is still supposed to be on schedule; I'm planning on leaving the house soon. (So, probably no blogging until I come home.) I'm not sure if it's actually going to leave on time though, since the flight from Providence to Newark has been delayed 20-30 minutes waiting for "inbound aircraft." Originally, the delay for that departure was 2 minutes, but that's now developed into 32 minutes. We'll see what happens!

      Whaddya know, my flight got cancelled.  But Continental was able to reschedule me onto a flight an hour earlier, so I should still be able to go to Pittsburgh.  (That flight comes in from Providence; the original one was from Baltimore.) But imagine my shock when I looked at the computer flight status at 1:30 pm and found out my 7:10 pm flight was cancelled... and it's not even raining yet!

      I find it amusing that after my post about yesterday's light salad lunch, I had Taco Bell for dinner last night. And today for dinner, I had grilled cheese and curly fries. Yum. Sometimes I just need to indulge my food cravings. And tonight there were no cravings for salad. At least not the green kind... I could have gone for a tuna salad sandwich. ;-) But it's all good... because dinner came after an intense hour of cardio boxing... and it's not like I ate 3 grilled cheese sandwiches and 4 orders of curly fries. :)

      I try not to watch the news (except human interest stories... is that what they're called?... and business news... other stuff is too depressing or disturbing), so I learned from someone else's blog about New Jersey Governor McGreevey. What a shocker. I knew he was calling a press conference for today to talk about "current issues" or something like that, but I thought it was something related to corruption, not this. I was completely shocked to hear that he had a gay affair and that he resigned! (Initial shock was from the fact that he resigned; then the affair part set in.) Wow. Poor wife and kids. Wow.

      The sun is shining on a bright mid-August morning, and to no one's surprise, there's again a forecast of thunderstorms. Seems to be the norm this August... lots of thunderstorm forecasts and lots of cloudy days. Yesterday certainly wasn't an exception.  I swear the sky looked green yesterday at one point during the torrential downpours. Thunder shook the house; there were many bright flashes of lightning. I got stuck in the pouring rain after picking up my pictures at Costco. The rain went from zero to high speed wipers as I turned the corner. The umbrella couldn't keep my legs from feeling like they just got out of the shower, and I was so glad I was wearing large heels so that I didn't have to sink my feet into the river that I had to cross to get from the street to the sidewalk. Flash flood warning, yes indeed.  Thunderstorms are always fun to watch from indoors... especially from behind a large window. But getting stuck in it outside, being pelted with the raindrops and shaken by the thunder... well, that's a lot less fun.  In drier fun yesterday, I was at my aunt's house in Jersey, so we got to go to  urlLink Trader Joe's . I love Trader Joe's. They have these awesome pita chips with parmesan, garlic, and herb. Mmmm. Although all I could think about the whole time I was eating them with hummus (which was good, by the way), was that they would taste excellent with white bean dip. (Thanks, Fresco, for intriguing me with white bean dip!) Also picked up the usual: bags of Nasi Goreng, biryani, and chicken fried rice, other snack food (brownies and cheese crunchies). I also got this chickpea salad that looks incredibly delicious.  For lunch, we went to  urlLink Baumgart's  in Ridgewood. What an interesting place... looks like an ice cream parlor in the front room, and serving American diner fare, Chinese food, and sushi.  Talk about fusion, and not within the recipes (like all those "New American" places). I had a salad with mixed greens, grilled chicken, goat cheese, and tomatoes.  It was very good. I seem to eat a lot of salads in restaurants nowadays - am I rebelling from my overindulgent lunches over the summer which, although excellent, can only be described as decadent? I think I like the simplicity of salads... and also the fact that they feel like "clean food." (Does anyone else have this feeling - like certain foods just make you feel clean and healthy? This may warrant another post sometime.) Yum.  In other news, I'm still sore from Tuesday's muscle conditioning class. I am so out of shape... so in the past 5 days, I've done 2 days of aerobics, 1 day of muscle conditioning, and 1 day of yoga.  Must get in shape  now . Let's see how cardio boxing goes today. ;-)  Off to fix stuff around the house... how was your day?

      Yeah, yeah, I know I didn't post "The Amazing Race 5.5" and am jumping to 5.6. Oh well, that's okay.  And I know I'm posting before the show is over in other parts of the country. (NYC played it earlier because of Yankees baseball... like 3 hours earlier, but I just finished watching it on tape.) And to me, that's okay too. Might I actually get a post written and ready to go for TWoP by the time the thread opens, unlike other weeks where I usually have to read 13 pages before I can post anything (and since I'm at work, inevitably don't end up posting anything)?  We'll see. :)   (ETA: It's so strange that I'm posting to the void of cyberspace my thoughts on this show... where anyone who might actually read it might not have even seen the show... rather than just waiting/formulating a post for a message board where people could actually read and comment on it.  Oh well.)    Thoughts, from start to finish :   I really don't know how the moms are going to get around Cairo with no money... that seems awfully hard.   It is  so  awesome that they get to go into the Great Pyramid to the center to get their clue!! I'm so jealous.  I hope the fact that the cousins speak Arabic isn't going to help them at all.  Of all the teams that I want to have advantages, they are not one of them.  Detour: sheep or water... hard choice.  I think the water one would frustrate me because you'd have to make more than one trip, and I love sailing and being on the water... but I don't know if I could handle being around the goats.  Maybe I'd be allergic too. ;-)  All of these ancient Egyptian places look so cool!! Really makes me want to go to Egypt and visit, even though I got scared of actually going there (to ancient sites) by MacGyver.  I would  not  be a good person for this Roadblock.  Good eyes? Depends.  A lot of patience? Ehh... I'd end up like Linda sitting there at the end ready to tear her hair out.    I want to sail on the Nile!  Although it wasn't a surprise who got eliminated, it was still an  awesome  episode!!    Teams :   Colin/Christie: + (I like them... they may be aggressive and he may be mean sometimes, but I like how they're playing the game... and how they don't like the cousins. Haha.)  Chip/Kim: + (Wholeheartedly rooting for them along with C/C and B/N.)  Kami/Karli: + (I don't really dislike them... and I kind of want them to stay longer [but not at the expense of any teams I like] because they are so darn clueless and that makes it  really  funny.)  Brandon/Nicole: +  (They just seem really nice... although I'm not sure what's up with the preview for next week.)  Mirna/Charla: -  (They grate... they get on my nerves... she thinks she's always right and that everyone else is jealous of her... sorry, "honey," they just think you're obnoxious and rude.)  Linda/Karen: + (I don't like them as much as C/C, C/K, and B/N... but I do like them a lot, and think it's awesome they were able to get back into it even though they had no money! That shows a lot about them.)  Lance/Marshall: ~ (Never really liked them a lot, but never really hated them.  Although with his injury... I kind of hoped for their sake that this was their ending week.)   There are my thoughts... now if anyone's watched the show, feel free to comment... I wonder if anyone has. :)  I'm off to finish the laundry, so I don't think I'll get to TWoP before there are like 40 pages to read. ;-)

      Alert!! New to  urlLink Apple Trailers : The Phantom of the Opera!!  It's always dangerous when musicals get made into movies.  Chicago  was excellent; I also enjoyed  Moulin Rouge . But no matter how the end result turns out, I have to say this: the trailer is  beautiful .  Watch it. :)

      Maybe this will be the end of  For Love or Money . (Although I doubt it, considering NBC's track record with  Average Joe 3: Adam Returns  and the upcoming rumored  Average Jane .) I was an avid watcher of the show last summer (I think I'll be writing a future post on trashy dating reality TV), but this summer, since I watched less TV, I didn't see much of the show (instead, I was watching  Who Wants to Marry My Dad ). Last night, I did see the end of the show, and can't say I was happy with the outcome.  I was rooting for the guy to take the money and run. I saw most of the first half of the summer's  For Love or Money , back when Preston was choosing and Rachel was the most evil contestant. Then the producers brought her back to do the second half of the summer, and all I could think was that I wanted the guy who she picked to choose the money over her. The editing from the first half made it seem like all she cared about was the money, and if the guy picked her this time, she could get a million dollars... from what I saw of her in the first half, why would I want her to get that?  Sharp contrast from last year when I was rooting for Erin to take home the 2 million dollars. But I didn't ever hate Erin... and she was never portrayed as an evil money-hungry person. Granted, she chose the money over Rob, but who wouldn't? Okay, that sounded harsh. But I can understand that decision. And in the end, she walked away with 2 million dollars.  (ETA: I know it was a different situation, since Erin didn't have to choose between the money and Chad, and we don't know what she would do there, but still.)  And they are still together. Living together. And according to one magazine, rumored to get married sometime in the future. Which is nice. More than I can say for  The Bachelor  (not  The Bachelorette ).  It's totally against my nature to root for someone to pick money over love. In most circumstances. But this is television... edited television... with people who have known each other for about three weeks and started their entire "relationship" on a falsehood about money. Erin and Chad as the exception, it seems like no good can come of that. I know all the dating reality shows nowadays want to have lots of twists and turns, but maybe (hopefully?) this one has been played out for good.

      It's time to browse the  urlLink Apple Trailers  site again, and there aren't many new movie trailers.  I skipped the trailer for  Ray , because we saw that trailer before the  Manchurian Candidate  last time. (It's a movie I might rent, but probably wouldn't compel me to go to the theater.) As for the others... well, I have different opinions on them, mostly based on genre.  I think that  Saw  looks frightening.  The site was very dark, but I persevered and opened the trailer.  I don't even think I made it a third of the way through before I got frightened about potential nightmares, and I shut it off.  I usually skip trailers for horror movies... but I rarely stop a trailer before the halfway point (if at all).  I don't think I want to see this... whatever it is actually about (I hadn't figured it out by that point, but the sound/music and the imagery already was enough for me).  About  Batman Begins , here was my thought process: (1) How did I not even know they were making this movie?? I'm not that clueless; (2) I've seen every other  Batman  movie, so I might as well see this one too; (3) I've got to check IMDB to see who this actor is; he's kind of cute [Follow-up: It's Christian Bale.]; (4) Oh no wonder I didn't know about it yet... Summer 2005.  The new  Shark Tale  trailer rocks!! I'm so excited for this movie.   We Don't Live Here Anymore  looks like it could be a good movie as well.  I didn't know anything about it until watching the trailer, but it looks like it could be very well-done.  The premise behind  The Forgotten  is sort of frightening and chilling.  Someone erasing children from your life? *chills* Now I need to watch a happy movie trailer to erase the eerie feeling I got from watching this one. (Which makes me think I'll be skipping this movie, even if it's well-done.)  Spongebob Squarepants  should do the trick.  So, I guess from all the trailers above, the one that sparks my interest is  Shark Tale ... but that one I knew about already and was excited about already.  I think I used to have a much higher threshold for suspense in movies, but now it's dwindling. I'm starting to lean toward lighter movies, movies that aren't so dark, movies that have happy moments... Interesting.  ... Ooh... I found a couple more that I didn't see yet.  I'm interested in  Ocean's Twelve , but all the trailer does is list the names of the people involved.  I think I've seen this trailer for  The Polar Express  before, but it's one of those where it never hurts to watch it again. ;-)  Okay, enough trailer watching for the night.  Anyone have any opinions on any of those movies?

      The people who have known me for a long time probably know that I love to write.  Back in college, I used to write a  lot .  Between my journal, other creative writing, stuff for CAJ, I was always writing something... and writing made me happy. It's an art form, and just when I thought I might be developing some sort of (rudimentary) skill, law school happened.  It's hard to do creative writing while in law school, especially the first year.  You learn how to write legal memoranda, how to draft briefs... how to rid your writing of passive voice, nominalizations, and all those other things that gave your previous writing style.  You read cases, you write case briefs, you go through legal writing classes, and your time is so taken up with "mastering" legal reading and writing that by the time you want to start doing creative writing, you probably should get some sleep because classes start in less than six hours. Unless you're really disciplined, your habit of creative writing could really get sidetracked.  Which mine did.  When I used to walk around campus in college, I almost always had pen and paper with me.  I would get hit with inspirations to write by all sorts of things around me: my freshman year window, spring weather, even listening to certain music while gazing out a dorm window.  Sometimes, during the summers, I would find myself writing on restaurant (paper) napkins, jotting down ideas before they escaped me. [Aside: I find it funny that I had to specify that these were paper napkins since so many of the restaurants from this summer didn't have paper napkins. ;-) ] I don't do that anymore.  I don't know if it's because I'm more plugged in (cell phone/iPod), because I have more to do or more on my mind when I'm walking around (pure wandering v. running errands), or because I just haven't put time aside to write.  I used to be really good about it in high school - I wouldn't allow myself to sleep until I wrote something in my journal, and if I didn't have time to write that night, I'd make myself catch up another day.  After PROP started in college, there was no more of that catching up. It was usually more like "write in your journal when you have time or when you get a surge of emotions." But there was other creative writing going on then... not just my journal... so it wasn't like I just wasn't finding time to write anything at all.  Unlike now. Before this blog, the old one was a little haphazard.  I wrote sometimes.  I made lists.  I took a lot of quizzes.  Occasionally, I had something interesting to say.  I didn't get hit with inspirations for topics all that often. I'm so out of practice.  Back in college, I regretted not taking Daily Themes, because I thought it would really help me improve my writing style and skills.  Now? Now, I don't even think I could handle a week of Daily Themes. Not with how out of practice I am.  So, now that I've vented about how much I regret letting my writing go, what's the plan? Besides writing more and finding more time to write... I'm going to try to write consistently.  I'm going to try to set aside time to write. I'm going to try to write on all different things.  That's where you come in (if there's even a "you" that's reading this; I could be spewing thoughts to empty cyberspace for all I know) - I'm taking suggestions. No guarantee that I'll write on them, but maybe they'll wake my brain up. (Hmm... we'll see about that part.) But mostly I guess this post is about accountability.  I've put it here in black and white (or considering my color scheme, I guess maybe some other hues), and I'm going to try to hold myself to my word. Wish me luck. :)

      The  New York Times  ran an editorial last week about Cingular's new "Escape-A-Date" feature for cell phones, calling it "another step forward in the institutionalization of lying, for those who lack the mental wherewithal to lie for themselves." A few weeks or months ago (I really can't remember), they had another story about alibi clubs, which provided excuses for people to get out of things they needed to do and fake stories for people who wanted to do things they shouldn't be doing. Frankly, these things scare me - are we really at the point where people need to use technology and these "rescue calls" to get themselves out of situations like bad dates?  Maybe I'm getting this from TV shows or novels, but what happened to the days when someone would enlist a friend, someone they knew and trusted, to do this sort of rescue call thing, and would only do it if absolutely necessary? (At least there's some interpersonal connection and bond-building going on with that type of experience.) Or how about just suffering through a bad date, excruciating as it may be, to learn from it and move on? Or even relying upon yourself and your own ingenuity to figure out how to get out of a sticky situation? (Or in the cases of some of the alibis, how about just not cheating on your spouse? That could be a good place to start, rather than relying on someone else to give you an out.)  Am I just idealistic in thinking that people shouldn't be relying upon their cell phones to get them out of situations that make life interesting? I guess Escape-A-Date just wasn't made for people who think like me. ;-)

      Today was another day that just flew by... time's going so incredibly fast, and the summer program will be over in a blink of an eye. Too quick!   Notes from around my world :   *yawn* Now that I have an iPod, I get less sleep on the bus. I remember the days when I used to be completely passed out on the window (gross, I know) for a good half-hour straight, and I don't think I'm in as deep a slumber anymore. Now I mainly sleep through Brooklyn. ;)  Jennifer Garner's "13 Going on 30" came out today on DVD! Yay!  Lots of police in hard hats and carrying assault rifles (I think that's what they're called?) walking around with all the other cops near the new police parking lot (half of the block on Lexington between 53rd &amp; 54th).  The highlight of my work day (not lunch, just work) was sending an email with voting buttons, high importance, confidential, with replies to multiple recipients. (And getting all the replies!) Yes, I'm a dork and easily amused.  Lunch today was at Asiate in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (in the Time Warner Center). Not only is the restaurant so beautiful with a gorgeous view, but the food was so yummy. I'm going to need to expand on this further another time (when I don't need to be sleeping... and figuring out what I'm going to wear for the rest of the week).  I stumbled out of work today arms full (and going to ache tomorrow..) with stuff that I cleaned out of my desk. *sniff*  Post: The Amazing Race 5.5 to be written soon.  Bill Clinton is on Letterman right now and I'm totally sucked in. He's making me laugh. Laughter is good. They were talking about how hard it is to find time to write everyday. It's so true. Writing is a craft, and I'm so out of practice from not writing original things in so long. And it's so hard to get back into the habit of writing. (I'm sure my style has also completely changed.) Bill Clinton is just so impressive. Sigh. Completely different from the current "President."   Off to finish packing and head to sleep... how was your day?

      I usually never watch the news, but it was pretty difficult to avoid the news yesterday with the terror alerts being announced on every station all hours of the day. Originally I thought they were talking about the Citigroup building downtown and it sounded like a "normal" terror alert (i.e. not affecting me), but then I realized they were talking about the Citicorp building diagonally across the street from work, and I got startled.  It's not like you can do anything to stop a terrorist attack if it could happen; it's just that when you walk through a building daily, it's a little unsettling that it's being named as a target. So today, streets are closed, cops are everywhere, doors are locked, stores are closed, public atriums are closed, and people on the bus do nothing but speak hysterically causing me to up the volume of my iPod in an attempt to block them out. Everything at work seems quite subdued, especially compared to Friday... amazing how one little press release from the government can make things not so much fun anymore.  Almost feels like we are living in a war on the homefront ... waiting for something to strike, never knowing when, never knowing where, but feeling the anticipation in the air that something is imminent. It's such a sad and depressing feeling. I got it this morning when I walked out among locked doors and lots of parked police cars outside the Citicorp Center. I got it today as we listened to news radio all day with a view of the target. I felt it when I saw the flares and the police cars checking all the cars being sheparded into the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. I felt it when I saw the cop blockade and all the news cameras along Broadway in the Stock Exchange area. It's such a suppressing feeling and it can completely take you over... sigh. It's so hard to feel so helpless. One day at a time...

         My old cell phone (Nokia 6610), which I dearly cared for, has been falling ill lately, and as such, I have gotten a new cell phone. Well, relatively new, in the sense that it's not a new model at all (it was one of the ones I was considering when I got my new Nokia), but it's new to me (got it from a family friend no longer using it). My old phone had a big crack in the screen so T-Mobile didn't let me get a new one under my warranty, even though I wanted to turn it in for mechanical problems and not the darn crack. (Problems like, say, not always ringing and the buzzer not always working. Lately the battery has been refusing to charge when it feels like it, and when the battery's almost dead and I plug in the charger, it tells me it's full. Right.) So my colorful Nokia with its built-in FM radio and speakerphone and tons of other cool Nokia stuff will now be resting indefinitely. I've moved on to the Samsung phone in the picture. (I wanted to call the phone Sammie, but then I thought that would be too cheesy.) Hopefully now I'll actually get all my phone calls. :) Then again... that will only happen if I feel the phone when it's in silent mode... so we'll see. ;)

      I used to check out the  urlLink Apple Trailers site  on a regular basis during the school year, maybe even every week. But I've spent so little time on my home computer over the summer that I'm so behind! I was at the movies today and watching trailers, and with the exception of  Sky Captain , I didn't have a clue what the trailers were when they first started out! (Compare that with when I went to see LOTR or Harry Potter, and was trying to name off the trailers within the first few seconds after the studio logos.) I used to be so up-to-date with the trailers. Now I'm catching up for lost time.  Here are my first impressions on some movies based on the trailers I saw today (I'm including the trailers I saw in the theater)... I've starred the ones I want to see (** for really want to see, * for would be interested in seeing - not sure if in theaters or on DVD) ... it seems like a shorter list than the "want to see" list I had before the spring and summer movie seasons:     * Team America: World Police : Comes out in October, from the South Park guys. It looks interesting.. I'd be curious to see later trailers of it before deciding whether I would pay to see this in the theaters. It looks different though which can be refreshing. And if it's from the South Park guys... maybe it'll be good. :)   Superbabies Baby Genuises 2 : Was there a 1 of this movie? I don't remember it. Anyway, it looks like it would be really entertaining and fun, and I would enjoy it, but I'm not sure I'd pay to go see it. (Maybe rent it?)   Wicker Park : With Josh Hartnett, I think I'd be too scared to see this one.   ** First Daughter : Comes out in September, with Katie Holmes. SO CUTE. It looks like a chick flick, and I love Katie Holmes, and the movie looks so incredibly sweet.   Suspect Zero : Looks frighteningly suspenseful, not sure I would see it.   Paparazzi : Chilling in a different way, a little too Princess Diana-ish, and cuts a little too close to reality with the fact that the paparazzi really IS like that and it's scary.   Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow : Saw an earlier trailer for it, but I don't get it now. I thought it was going to be like Superman, but it doesn't look quite like that anymore.   * Collateral : I might be interested in seeing this one - even though it's suspenseful, it's a different kind of suspense than the other ones I'm too scared to see.   Kinsey : Want to see more trailers... looks interesting.   * Meet the Fockers : Watched the trailer for the title, realized it was a follow-up on  Meet the Parents , it looks amusing.   A Dirty Shame : Looks interesting, still need to learn more about it to figure out whether I want to see this NC-17 (!) rated movie.   * Christmas with the Kranks : This looks really amusing, and I love Christmas-themed comedies for whatever reason. How many times have I seen  Santa Clause ?   ** Shark Tale : DreamWorks animated movie, there's been lots of trailers and publicity for it, definitely want to see this -  Finding Nemo  but not.   Little Black Book : I'm up for most romantic comedies. :)   * Friday Night Lights : Also a sucker for sports movies.   * Wimbledon : Could be cute. [Aside: how come half the time when I load a Quicktime movie, it never loads the whole thing?!]

         I achieved my goal of the weekend, which was to go see  The Manchurian Candidate  in the theaters. I thought it was a quite powerful movie, one that's not just entertaining but that makes you think about it long after it's over. It's a very different movie from the 1962 movie (which was one of my favorites of all-time), and I think, while you can draw comparisons, in the end you're evaluating the movie on its own terms as if it's an entirely different movie and not just a remake. I'm still thinking about the movie, so I don't have a well-formulated review in my head and won't be writing one now, but I would definitely be interested in hearing what others have to say about the movie.

         I didn't recap my thoughts on the first 3 episodes, but I figure the St. Petersburg leg is as good a time as any to start. :) I just watched the encore presentation of the episode tonight and it was quite fun. (I LOVE THIS SHOW! :) ) Since I've got to sleep soon, here's just some quick thoughts and how I feel about each of the teams at the end of episode 4:   Thoughts :   A lot of teams seem to have learned more Spanish words while at the pit stop in Bariloche. Could they not do this in Uruguay?  I would go berserk on a 20 hour bus ride to Buenos Aires. And those long flights from Buenos Aires to St. Petersburg.  Russia looks freezing. I hope no one forgot winter coats.  I want to take one of those vodka shots! They looked like so much fun.  Having to eat 2 lbs of caviar is frightening. I would never have been able to do the Roadblock and we would have lost.  The palace in Pushkin is pretty. :)    Teams :   Chip/Kim: + (I didn't like them in the cab "fiasco" but I do now.)  Colin/Christie: + (I don't like it when he yells at her, but I generally like them.)  Brandon/Nicole: + (He was really sweet to her when she looked like she would pass out.)  Marshall/Lance: ~ (That's the symbol for neutral... They can be obnoxious sometimes, but I don't hate them as much as some other people seem to.)  Kami/Karli: + (I actually like them, unlike a lot of others it seems. They are very competitive and intense, but I don't see how that can be terrible in a race..)  Linda/Karen: + (They seem like so much fun.)  Charla/Mirna: - - - - - - (I saved the worst for last. My goodness, I can't stand listening to her whine.. and the editors are doing a great job of showing how she glares at other people and is generally obnoxious. That article saying people don't like Mirna because she's a strong woman? [Oh no, this sounds like Omarosa again..] Puh-leeze... people don't like her because they wouldn't want to be cooped up in a room with her!)   Poor Bob and Joyce... They, along with Brandon and Nicole, were probably my favorites going into this episode and they got eliminated. (And stupid CBS ruined the ending because it could have been a non-elimination leg and I wouldn't have known otherwise had they not said they would talk to the losers on the Early Show!) Last week, Jim and Marsha were my favorites and they got eliminated. (Having nice teams getting eliminated with really sweet last lines makes me cry every week.) Maybe I should stop having favorites. I think right now I just have a strong NON-favorite. They annoy me so much. But don't let this ringing endorsement of that one team keep you from watching the best show on television this summer. :) It really is fantastic and it deserves the Reality Show Emmy - you should be watching! :)
