      Okay, so I just got back from my cousin's wedding... Mike Bitner.  He got married to Marsha Edmenson (Or however it's spelled), and that's cool and everything, but he asked me to film it for him, and I tried... and it might turn out okay, but I don't know.  I went to a rehersal dinner yesterday and felt awkward because I didn't know anyone.  Well, tonight was about as awkward, only, my family was there, so it was okay, because I just talked to Loren and Erin when I didn't know what to do.   The filming went okay, I guess, I felt odd, walking around, taping stuff while there was an official wedding going on and whatnot, but it was outside in the woods near a little beach thingy, so I guess it was a little unorthodox to start with.  Plus, most of the time, other than the obvious parents, pastor, and the to-be-married themself, I didn't really know who else they wanted me to capture on film, so I just kinda got everyone.  I figure Mike can just cut out whoever he wants from the video, so it's no skin off my nose.  Anyway, I'm getting behind in this blogging thing... and I don't really feel like working on it right now.  Exactly what I was afraid would happen.  So... I guess I'll catch up when I do.

      Today I basically wasted my whole day at work.  Usually I don't feel a day at work has been wasted, but this paticular day consisted of seven hours of almost nothing.  Slow, tedious, never-ending nothing.  Nothing in a place that nothing is not meant to be.  Not nothing in a nice, air-conditioned room watching meaningless cartoons, nothing in a hot, oven-heated, angry-customer-filled room that smells bad.  (not that bad, but I was going for the contrast).  Also, the other night, I went with some people to go see "Collateral".  It was an odd movie staring Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.  Basically what happens is this guy makes this taxi driver drive around to all of these witnesses that he has to kill, and the cab driver keeps trying to get away or get help, but it never works.  I won't give away what happens, but it's a really depressing ending, so get ready to cry for years.  Also, another odd fact of going to see the movie is that Mrs. Eubanks, my 7th grade Reading teacher was there.  I haven't seen her since, say... 7th grade.  But I knew who she was.  I didn't quite recognize her; she didn't have her trademark humungo glasses on.  Or her large cup of coffee that she spent half an hour getting, either.  And she didn't assign us to read any books about war, or black city sports, or anything like that.  SO, we had an awkward moment, because she happened to be seeing the same movie we were, and was waiting for a couple of girls outside of the theatre.  We were already late, and I wanted to catch as much of the previews as I could, but she was doing some figuring out of who we were, and she was definetly taking her time with it.  Especially Krystle who, after several minutes, she decided she had never taught.  10 points for Eubanks!  She thought I had graduated, too.  Oh well, if I was a teacher, I wouldn't remember my students very well, either.  I will admit to that.  Anyway, it's horribly late, and I have to go to work and then a wedding tomorrow, so I'll work on this later.  Ciao!

      For LHS's National Honor Society, a new crudential has been added.  Ten hours of community service.  Now that's all fine and dandy with me, but I'm not exactly sure what counts as community service.  Apparently, though, I've already gotten roughly 5 hours of it.  Today, I spent about two hours gathering "first-day" paper bundles for school with David.  We had as much fun with it as is possible, and got to see Dr. Z, who unlocked some doors for us.  But the real story was yesterday.  David and I were painting the pastor's picket fence white, and we'd just gotten about a third of the outside done, when all of a sudden, these two guys start shouting at eachother.  I was aquainted with one of them, I see him around every now and then, and he's dating a girl in my class.  The other guy, I had only just met him, and he was helping paint the fence.  I would think maybe both of these guys are in their early to mid twenties, but I'm not really sure.  At least that old.  But anyway, the boyfriend introduces himself to the guy, and tells him that they need to talk.  Well, he asks what about, and the boyfriend says thy need to talk about why he's all over a 15-year old, or something like that.  And then they start shouting, and the boyfriend's yelling, "Go ahead, hit me!" and it was really funny and awkward, David and I sitting there painting, trying to keep from laughing.  Very interesting.  Anyway, we got three more hours right there, so we're already half way.  Anyway, I've got an orthodontist appointment to attend to, so I guess I'll touch base later, ay?

      Well, as much as I'd like to keep everyone on the edge of their seats, I still don't really have much to report... go figure.  I'm still doing the exact same thing I mentioned in my previous entry every day, and I probably will be until school starts.  The one thing I did do differently yesterday was go out to the covered bridge with David and Krystle.  We had a good time, we scared the whirlygig beetles, and fed cheese twists to a frisky chipmunk, which, after fleeing into his hole, we then attempted to drown with some coke, and we also got rust stains all over us on the swings (at least David did).  It was a nice change of pace, Krystle made us all Turkey sandwiches, and we ate them as the swift currents of the calm river peacefully relaxed our minds... Ah, yes... Then we came back and just hung around, found out I still have some bugs to fix in my hook-up of our entertainment center, and played Simpsons Clue  (I won, it was all too obvious that it was Homer in the Kwik-E-Mart with the slingshot).  Ah, yes, the productive life of me.  It's a simple life, but I enjoy it.  Anyway, that baritone isn't going to learn how to play itself... and neither am I, at this rate... More to come later! (Aren't you excited?)

           Okay, still not much to report. All's silent on the western front. But I have to be patient. I mean, as soon as school starts, all kinds of stuff is going to start happening, and that's good.       This summer went really fast, but compared to other summers, seemed to consist of nothing. In one aspect, that's kind of sad, but maybe it will help me to appreciate this school year more. Sure, school means getting up earlier, having assignments due, having to deal with some people that I'd rather not, but on the flipside, I get to see a lot more people that I miss over the summer and some of my classes are even fun. An example of this will hopefully be my AP English class.       There are a lot of good kids in that class, kids I can have fun with.  Sam, Matt, Scott, David, and a few more that I can't quite remember off of my head.  All of my memories of Mrs. Young's 10th grade class are simply of Scott and I doing as we pleased, but still getting the highest grades in that class.  And that's pretty cool.  I figure this class will either be really easy and fun, or really hard and fun.  Either way, that's a good deal.       Also first sememster, I have some video editing class with Mr. Ehrmantraut for no credit, and I saw some real undeserving people sign up for it, so I don't know how that will go.  David's in it with me, too, and that's wicked awesome, because I haven't had a lot of classes with my friends in High School, what with Spanish and Agriculture.  Spanish was at least worth it, because I've met a lot of neat people in those classes, and Mrs. Simmers is pretty awesome.  Now, Agriculture... I can't say much for that class.  It was a good class, but the only person I felt I could really talk to in there was Jarrod Pollard, even though Mrs. Carnigie was really nice, too.       Anyway, I had better get back to what I've been doing for the past few weeks: Playing Nintendo, reading English AP books, and practicing baritone.  So, until next time, don't spend all of your potatoes in one place.

            Welcome to my blog!  This is, perhaps, my third attempt at one of these "on-line journal" type things, and I'm having big dreams and hopes for it.  Ah, the possibilities of the internet.  For example, I bet Josh Server from All That is reading this right now... I can only dream...
