      hi-dee-ho, this is taylor..   I'm really feeling awful at the moment. I was having SUCH a great day. But, "what goes up must come down". And I've come down fast. I hurt very badly right now. Like I could die within 5 minutes. I have trouble coping with pain. I'm sorry if I hurt you Sarah. She tried to cheer me up, but it didn't work very well. I only made her hurt. I feel like such an inadequate partner when I'm like this. I can't take care of myself and I can't take care of her all at the same time. It's such a terrible feeling. I love you Sarah, remember that. Well I don't really feel like writing much more. Chemistry test was easy. I hope everyone had a great day! Tomorrow's friday. That's always good. *kiss and hug* to Sarah. bye bye

      Hello everyone (Taylor speaking)!  This is the last post of April 28 (sad, i know) but anyways...    I GOT MY CELL PHONE BACK!!!  oh my goodness! i have missed it oh so much! I got it taken away like 4 weeks ago? Well, I just missed it! It's such a part of me! I don't know, finally Sarah can call me again, without having to talk to my parental figures, what a saving grace! I am so thoroughly excited! This day could not be better.. well maybe.. if i had some fudge or some cookies or be out all night, you know, those unattainable things! anyways, enough ranting about chocolate and parties, i'll be gone! Have a great night everyone *kiss* to Sarah, and I will post sometime tomorrow! bye-bye

      Hey Everyone, Taylor speaking...  I had a  GREAT  day today! WE (me and sarah, of course) had a great day. So first of all, I get to see Sarah all dressed up! She looked so adorable. Today at school, the ring and pin ceremony was held. How fun is that?... yeah that's what I think! But it lasted a pretty long while and I got to see Sarah, so it was worth it. The juniors today were VERY excited about their new class rings, which they should be! Everyone was very excited. It was a good day. I had to perform my scene in Acting, which wasn't very good, but oh well. It's over now. After school, (BEST part of day), I got to go to Sarah's house until 7:30. She did calculus with Andrew for a long while. After he left, we ate pizza and watched VH1. It was the highlight of my month of April I think. I love her so much. I miss just being able to spend time with her.  Prom is coming up! I am so very excited! This might be my only year that I'm going, we'll see. I'll tell you about my dress...(like you want to hear I know) Its a black strapless dress, it has a slit on the left mid thigh, around the slit it has cool bright blue flowers and shit.. I think it'll be cool. It's easy to walk in at least. Sarah's is BEAUTIFUL. I haven't seen her in it yet though! grrrr...Its all red, with a pretty low back, the sleeves are different and the whole dress is kind of "flirty" and fun. Its formal but not starch and "promish" if you know what I mean... Anyway, prom should be a lot of fun.   As you may know, I've been in Casa Kids, a Casa Manana touring group, this entire year. Well Saturday is my LAST PERFORMANCE! It is going to be sad and happy at the same time. I really am going to miss the kids in the group. They are so very talented, i luv em. They're great. I'll miss my director too. She's fun.  Well that's all for now, maybe I'll post later!

      Hey . . Well this is the last post for April 27 (so sad, I know). Well everything is going well in Sarah/Taylor world. We're stressed out but holding on to each other to get by. This is Taylor speaking at the moment... Sarah went to bed about 20 minutes or so ago. I'm about to. I'm quite tired. Tomorrow.. Ring and Pin ceremony.. we miss 10 minutes of 2nd and most of the tutorial.. oh well! At least I get to Sarah all dressy! She looks so pretty everytime she dresses up!   Okay, sorry. Anyways, May 7 (AP Euro test) for sophomores.. that's in... 9 days! wow! good luck you guys! you'll do fine! =D! he overprepares you *yawn* You guys all will get a minimum of a 3. You're all amazing!! I could never do what you all have been able to accomplish, I'm proud.  Right now.. Listening to Tatu- All the things she said except in Russian (Doesn't sound as repetitive) hehe. My CD player is on random song out of like 20 cd's so.. it'll change soon. Well I guess that is all for now. Have a great night and a great April 28! I'll update tomorrow. I love you sarah  bye bye!

      hello all. Well the grandparents are in town, so i'm having to socialize with the family more than I usually do...(This is taylor speaking) Sarah's doing homework because she actually works.. I just take easier classes and get my work done at school... So basically i'm bored. How is everyone doing? I know everyone is stressed out because AP tests are NEXT week!! Good Luck Sarah! hehe. i'm not taking any because I didn't think I would pass AP Comp. Sci. nor AP Euro. That's alright. There's always next year. I hope everyone is doing well. School is almost over, Sarah's almost graduating! (It's so sad!! I'm going to cry at graduation!) What else is coming up?   May 1 - Sarah and I are going to see Chess at OU May 8 - Prom and Survivor Island(go jenny and bonnie! hehe), who all is going!? comment if you are May 12 - Senior Dinner (oh senior video, so corny and great) May 15 - Graduation! *tear* May 25-27 - Are these final days? I'm not sure  So that's basically all that is coming up that I can remember AT this moment. I wish I was a senior... Sarah and I are doing well, we're both happy and stressed and frazzled at the same time. We're multitaskful (is that a word?) anyways... my (taylor's) english test was hard today.. I hope I did well. We'll post more later! bye bye

      Okay so, right now... Sarah is taking an AP Bio practice exam and I am in the computer lab writing to all of those who are out there. I miss her but I really should work on some english. Okay.. Let me give you some background. She can probably do it better than I can (she's an english person, i'm not) but basically we're a couple who wanted to create a blog.. and here it is! I love her very much and we love each other. (we're two girls by the way) interesting I know, but we love it! Okay, well I'll have her write some more later! Bye bye!

      hey people, sarah here.  today was great!  i got up around ten and lounged around the house for a while, reading and such.  i made myself a tuna fish sandwich and promptly dropped my v8 splash, spreading red juice all over the kitchen floor.  my mom came in, said "whoops," and helped me clean it up, so it was all good.  then my dad came in and said, "i heard you tried to mop the floor with juice" and i said yep and he said "how'd it work?" and i replied "not too well, actually."  he just laughed.  and holy crap he might not work for three months cuz he got injured playing soccer.  my mother and i might shoot him if he is home for that long.  i dunno what we're going to do.  taylor started working out today!  i'm so proud of her.  she did her mom's workout with her, and i think they're going to try to make that a regular thing.  it's so great that taylor's getting into shape and getting healthy and such.  i went to taylor's house around 4 and downloaded spybot onto her computer to try to get rid of some of her spyware shit.  her computer is so awful cuz of that stuff.  i think i fixed a lot of it, but there's still some on there that needs to be taken care of.  i need more time though.  i helped taylor with some laundry cuz she has like seven loads to do of just her clothes.  i swear that girl was about to have to walk around naked cuz every single article of clothing she owned was dirty.  so now her mom is making her do laundry every monday so it won't be as much next time.  speaking of laundry, i need to do mine too....  then we went to california pizza kitchen.  we got the classic, the bbq chicken pizza, and we also got one that was roasted potatoes and grilled chicken.  both were great.  i got a brownie sundae for dessert and taylor got a chocolate pie a la mode thing.  we splurged, it was great.  then we went to see the day after tomorrow.  oh my god, it was so good.  just... wow.  any movie that can inspire that kind of emotional response is a winner with me.  there were times when we were holding each other's hands so hard they started to ache.  good movie.  highly reccommended.  after that, i took taylor home, and here i am!  she starts her non-paying full-time job tomorrow (which pisses me off but i won't go into that), and her mom is getting a little annoyed with how much time we've been spending together, so we won't see each other till wednesday at the earliest.  but that's okay.  we'll survive.  bedtime!

I'm done..  School is out! That's so amazing! I can't believe my sophomore year is over. I am now an upperclassmen. I wish i was a senior, but i suppose i can wait.. grrrr... Sarah's a freshman now! Aww poor thing! pobrecita! Oh well! She's still in COLLEGE while i'm in HIGH SCHOOL! ugh, i feel so young. My birthday is in like a week.. wow. I don't even know if i'm getting anything.

      hey everyone, sarah here.  i had a fun day today.  i got up early, around 9:30, and went to the grocery store to get food and stuff for today.  i got fruit and veggies and chips and queso and lots of candy and cupcakes.  it was fun.  but then i had to cut and wash all the vegetables.  geez, it's so much easier to just eat junk food.  no wonder so many americans are obese.    so then at noon i went to pick up taylor at school.  she said her finals went well, and mr beam told her that there were 124 required points on her pre-cal exam and she got 125 points.  so GO TAYLOR!!!  i'm so proud of her.  she's a junior!  an upperclassman!  yay taylor!  then we got back to my house and leah and jenny came over.  we "grazed", as my mother called it, on the food, then went swimming.  jenny couldn't get her hair wet, cuz she was going out with her boyfriend later, and leah wouldn't get in the pool so we just splashed her and got her clothes soaking wet.  that was pretty funny.  then lisa showed up and we swam some more.  i think we all got a little sunburned cuz we're white as ghosts.  jenny and leah left, then taylor and lisa and i watched gothika, school of rock, and sixteen candles.  then i took them both home, and here i am!  when i got home i saw that my mom had cleaned up all the food and stuff for me, so i need to remember to thank her for that.    my dad got my car inspected today cuz my sticker expired in april, so i won't get a ticket for that.  i need to remember to thank him for that too, even though he griped at me for keeping my driver's license and credit card in the car.  he doesn't understand that if i don't leave them in there, i'll forget them every time.  i'm not a purse person, and i don't carry a wallet.  phone and keys are hard enough for me to keep up with.  i think that's all i have to say, so i'm out. *kiss* to taylor

      hey all! taylor blogging for the sarah/taylor AKA "us" blog =)  First off, WE are doing great! Couldn't be more happy for each other. Sarah's so excited about my excellent test today and the fact that i am getting out of school tomorrow. I'm excited for her first quarter of northwestern. Those classes sound AWESOME! I wish they had those at Oakridge for juniors. Hehe.  Finals so far:.. History, Relatively easy. The multiple choice was hard, but that's it. Pre-cal today. Hmm.. Well i tallied it up and i think i missed 21 points on the test, but i did 34 bonus points which i am pretty damn confident on! Also i have 4.2 bonus from the review we did earlier in the 4th 9 weeks. We'll see.. I REALLY hope i did well.   Tomorrow's Finals: Chemistry. You know, i'm never sure if i am going to do well on one of her tests. Its basically, you either remember this section, or you don't. I did all of the review. I could feel a LITTLE more prepared, but oh well. I think i should do alright. English. I think i know my vocabulary pretty well, got the essays down, got the romantic, victorian, and 20th century down. I think i should do fairly well. I want an A- or above on both of my tests tomorrow, but if I don't, that's okay too!  Then after our finals tomorrow, we're Juniors! One more year closer to getting out of Oakridge and living with Sarah! woo-hoo! I cannot wait! Juniors.. so young yet so old. I'm not going to think about that yet. hehe. I'm going over to swim at sarah's house tomorrow. It should be a LOT of fun. This weekend I'm going to Scarborough fair with Sarah and Lisa. I just cannot be separated from Sarah. I haven't gotten sick of her yet. Odd, eh? Yeah that's what i thought! hehe  I got the new Avril Lavigne cd for sarah and its actually pretty good =X. aah! I liked it! Its better than her first one! eek! lol. Well i'm tired and i should go to bed. I have to do well on my finals tomorrow! Everyone have a great night! *hugs and kisses* to sarah!

      how's it going everybody?  sarah here.  i had a great day today.  i got up and watched some tv until 11:15, then went to get taylor at her house.  she said she thinks she got her A++ on her pre-cal final, so YAY TAYLOR!  we had ramen, then went to the mall to get me a new swimsuit.  it's really cute, triangle top and boyshorts with stripeys on it.  then we went back to my house and hung out and swam for a while.  when we went to drive back to her house, the clouds opened and it started POURING so it took us about 45 minutes to get there.  we both felt bad because we made her family's dinner late, but what are ya gonna do about the weather, right?  then we sat around watching tv, and her satellite went out cuz of the storm, so we got a movie.  then, just as the movie was starting, the power went out.  so now we have john running around lighting candles and trying to study while the two little boys are babbling and carrying flashlights.  it was rather interesting.  when the lights came back on i (sort of) helped taylor study for english, then we watched some of a movie.  i left around nine.  when i got home my mom had to show me all the clothes and stuff she bought at the mall today.  umm and she bought me some stuff for my hair that she got from my hairdresser cuz it's been really stiff since i dyed it, so i'm gonna try that out tomorrow i think.  that's all i have to say for now! *kiss to taylor*

      howdy!  Great word, huh? I thought so, i'm definitely just kidding! Well i really have an urge to listen to Chess music or Sweeney Todd music so I definitely will do that in a second. How has everybody's day been? My day has been GREAT! ...  The AP Euro test. It wasn't too bad. I probably got about a 40 on the Multiple Choice, I didn't even start over-analyzing, and I didn't go back to check when I was finished. I think I wrote a really good DBQ though! We shall see, won't we? I really hope I did okay though!  After the test I went to the Parks Mall with Sarah. It was really great because NO ONE was there. And i hate when it's so crowded! We went to exchange her size 9 converse that i got her to a size 8 at Journey's! Now she has fitting shoes and they look really awesome on her! After that we ate at Sbarro's. Got stuffed. Oh yeah! After we ate, we went to Hot Topic to finally spend my $85's worth of gift certificates that i have from there! We got so much cool stuff! She got a REALLY awesome hat! Looks very good in it too..  What we got at hot topic: 1. Gray hat 2. Lots o' shoe laces 3. A Stewey Shirt that says "Quit mocking me" I believe 4. A Rocky Horror Picture Show shirt  5. Some Office Space stuff for my Dad and Mr. Newberry  So yeah, we were "shopaholics" today! It was kind of fun, especially when NO one was there! I loved that. After we went to Hot Topic, we got a starbucks and then drove back to my house. She helped me study for my pre-cal test tomorrow! I feel VERY confident in the material. I really hope I do well. I need to do well on this test! It shouldn't be too hard. I know how to do every single review question, so it shouldn't be too hard =). Oh! She needs to quiz me some more tonight on the nth term and sum formulas for geometric and arithmetic series. I'll do that later! I don't feel like it right now! I miss her ALREADY. She only left about 10 minutes ago. Well I really don't know what else to post about except that tomorrow will be fun because we are going to swim. Friday will be easy because it's english and chem! I'll post some more later on! I think i'm going to do some quizilla quizzes and post them up here, hehe.   Buh-bye! *kisses* to sarah!

      so i just made a list of my top ten freshman seminars for next year at northwestern... the options they have are so fucking awesome!  here are my top ten: mental illness: science and society rational or irrational behavior: who's to say? csi northwestern: forensic chemistry searching for et: science and strategies psychology and media: dogma and data genes, privacy, and reproductive choices curiouser and curiouser: our evolving perceptions the uses of satire death of the dinosaurs the crusades don't those sound cool?!  i thought they did.  i'm so excited.  i would LOVE to be in any of those classes!  then i had to pick a tentative schedule for next year, so i picked intermediate spanish, calculus, and astronomy.  they suggest you take four classes per quarter, with the seminar being one of them.  so that's done.  now i just have to do my housing app, which isn't due till june 11th so i have time.    i'm also excited about seeing taylor tomorrow!  i get to take her to lunch and spend a few hours with her.  that's not much, i know, but during her finals week i'm gonna take what i can get.  all i've done today is read and eat macaroni and cheese.  i love summer.    *kiss to taylor*

      hey all. =)  My mom brought me Chipotle today and I'd like to start off my blog with this story that is on the back of the cup. Now, I'm not saying they were TRYING to be dirty or sexual with it, but GOD it sounds like it! Turn your dirty minds on and read..   ONE PHWAP OR TWO?   It's easy to find beauty in the world, if you know where to look. We find it in the phwap, our word (noun or verb) for the dramatic yet graceful release of a spoonful of extra richness onto  your welcoming burrito.  This seemingly careless yet cultivated flick of the wrist is the product of hundreds of hours of practice, building thousands of burritos. It demands a light touch with 100% pure sour cream and a more energetic, even aggressive flip when applying the green gold of our freshly made guacamole.  Placement of the said stuff, of course is key; always satisfyingly centered for perfect flavor distribution. But it is the swiftness and delightful nonchalance of the movement that elevates the phwap from mere "spooning."  As always, we encourage you to customize your burrito, perhaps with a heavier, lighter or even a second phwap. Your servers are glad to  oblige. And as they do, we hope you'll appreciate the fine art of phwappage.  Okay so, what do you guys think? I'm sorry, but it just sounds a little fishy to me! Anyways.. School was pretty good today. It was only until noon so it wasn't too long or too boring. It was my last day of class with Mrs. Ingram, Mr. Metcalf, Mr. Ice, Ms. Langley, and Mr. Beam. How sad? It is a little bit sad. Oh well, They have a good class coming up next year! And good bye to Mrs. Ingram and Mr. Ice. I hope they'll be happy in their retirement. I'll miss them.   I went to the Pre-calculus review today. Mr. Beam wants me to get an A++ on this test in order to raise my Second Semester average up to an A- but i really don't think that is going to happen. If it doesn't, it will be no big deal, B+? I'm definitely happy with that. But i really do need to do well on it. I need to focus on history for now. Basically all i can do is take the tests on my APCD and um.. hope? Yeah, that's all. I remember the structure of DBQ so i'll do just fine!  COMING UP!  Wednesday, May 26, 2004 8:00-9:45 Take Euro final! oh goodness 10:00 Sarah picks me up 10:00-1:00 Go eat at Chili's maybe and then go return her converse at Parks mall  Thursday, May 27, 2004 8:00-9:45 Take Pre-cal final!  10:00 Mom comes to pick me up 12:00 Sarah picks me up 12:00-5:30ish swim at Sarah's and eat some more! yay, hehe  That's pretty much all i know from this week so far. I really should go start studying for my history final. All of the AP European takers are very happy that they don't have any school tomorrow! I, for one, did not take it and now I suffer the consequences. Oh well, I'm willing to do it. It's not too bad for me.  I hope everyone has a great day and a great night! I'll post some more later. Bye everyone! *kisses* to Sarah!

      hi everyone, taylor posting for the sarah/taylor blog  i'll talk a little about us. We're doing AMAZINGLY FANTASTICALLY great, okay sorry. I couldn't be happier with anyone but her! she's, just, i can't describe it. There's no one else for me but her. We couldn't be happier. And I am so proud of her for starting a new life at Northwestern in the coming months. She's going to acquire so much more knowledge and be even smarter than me. We have such an opportunity here to both grow as individuals and make "us" a stronger entity. I love you Sarah!  I hope everyone had a good day! What does everyone think of the new schedule? I think it works out pretty well except for those who have elective tests. I'm sorry to those people that do. Now i have an exam on thursday, but that it isn't a big deal AT all. I don't know if i should go to her funeral. As Sarah put earlier to me, "Funerals are a time for people who knew the person well and family to get together and celebrate her existence." It's very true and I, unfortunately, didn't know her too well. I'll see.   I'm taking 3 AP classes next year. What is the matter with me?! I was trying to create an easier year for myself next year. But i kind of have this raw carnal desire inside me to do AP Chemistry. I have no idea why. I feel that i haven't learned enough about it this year. We'll see how i do. If i have too much work by the first interim, i'll either drop AP chemistry or AP lang and comp.   I had a good day and i'll have four more good days because me and sarah have some really cool things that we're doing in the coming days. Alright, well i can't think of many more things to write about.  I really want to write some more in the coming months. I want to have some solid poetry that i could send to people that I actually like. Sarah has so many amazing stories and poems, ask her to send you some, sometime. I hope some day i could have half of her talent to write. Maybe... All i can do is hope and work to that point.  I'm out for tonight you guys, i'll post tomorrow. Half day!

      hi everyone, sarah here.  so what were the events of the day?  hmmm.  i got up around 10 i think, then went running and got in the pool for a little while.  i'm getting over my soreness, so that's good.  i like that i'm exercising again.  it makes me feel better and like myself more.  i had to go up to oakridge today to pick up a graduation video and i talked to andrew for a bit, but i missed taylor.  so then i went over to her house and hung out with her for a little while.  she looked so beautiful in her dress with her hair all curled.  i wish i'd taken a picture.  oh well.  we planned out our events for wednesday and thursday.  i'm sure you all don't care, but here they are anyway: wednesday: i pick taylor up at school at 10, then we go to the parks mall to exchange the shoes she bought for me for a graduation present (they were a little too big), then go to lunch and i drop her off around 1:00. thursday:  taylor's mom picks her up from school at 10 and takes her home.  i pick her up at 12, we go to lunch, then we go back to my house to hang out and go swimming.  then i take her back around 5:30 or so.  whew.  you have no idea how long it took to plan all that.  taylor's mom was actually saying her brain hurt when she left the room, lol.  her parents are becoming so much better about letting us see each other and giving her some freedom.  my parents are actually the ones being bitches now.  role reversal, weird.    bye

      hello everyone, taylor posting  Wow i haven't posted since saturday! I feel so inadequate. Anyway i'll post now! Umm what should i post today?  Awards Ceremony: I got Outstanding Honors Chem, Outstanding Beginning Acting, and Outstanding Choir, woohoo! I was really excited. I didn't think I was going to get that many awards..  I had a GREAT day today all because of.. hmm, drum roll please...*drums roll* SARAH! She was up at school and I didn't get to see her! I was so mad at myself. But she came to my house and we got to be with each other for about an hour! I hadn't seen her since saturday and I won't see her again until wednesday. But we had a fun time at least! yay, that made my day so great.  Sunday, I basically was sick ALL day long. Throwing up, fever, eating crackers when i felt a little better, taking baths, i mean i haven't been that sick in a long long while. My mommy took care of me though. I felt like such a baby. I hated it, haha.  Sarah's addicted to this new fishy game. I have GOT to try that out!! Keep commenting on how you're doing on it. Sarah's really really good at it.   I had a really good day. I hope everyone else did. I miss you sarah. *kisses* only 4 more days and then we are out of here!

      hey everybody, sarah here.  okay first of all i'd like to say THANK YOU to the vast majority of people who have been supportive of me and taylor.  it seems like i just dwell on the bad stuff, but i want to acknowledge those of you who've been really great about all of this.  especially michael and ryan, who have commented a lot and really stood up for us.  you guys rock!  anyhoo, back to life.  i'm so sore today because i went running yesterday.  i'm not sure if i'll go again today or wait till tomorrow.  i'll probably just swim today to work out some of the soreness.  i miss the muscle tone i had during field hockey, so i'm trying to work out and eat better and stuff to maybe get it back.  i'm sick of feeling blah.  and i miss going outside and sweating, which sounds really weird but it's true.  feeling sweat drip off your nose and run down your neck is actually quite satisfying.    yup, taylor and i saw godsend yesterday.  it wasn't very good.  but oh well.  we had some problems getting in and out of downtown fort worth, but she called her dad and he helped us out.  now i think i could do it easily without any help.  we did have a fight, but we talked it out and resolved it.  we're pretty good at that.  i can't wait till taylor gets done with school.  of course, then she has to start work so i still won't get to see her very much....  sigh.  maybe that'll get me motivated to go get a job.    i need to pick a schedule for next year by june 1st!  and i need to fill out my housing application pretty soon too.  which would be easy, but i have to write a fucking essay about why i want to be in a residential college instead of just a dorm.  it'll be easy, but i'm lazy.  grr.  *kiss* to taylor

      hey, taylor posting/speaking  I had a pretty good day overall. How was everyone's saturday? I hope it was a little better than mine, I just didn't feel very well. I was really moody all morning. I didn't want to study. I was tired and groggy. I just felt gross, like I needed to work out and needed to lose weight.   I thought this mainly because I ate ALL morning long. First i had toaster strudel, then i wanted pop tarts, after that it was black beans and rice. I mean, i was constantly eating. I don't know what has come over me the past few weeks. I've just been constantly eating something. I have got to stop this habit. I've already noticed myself getting a little fatter in the stomach and the arms. I'm not having a growth spurt, that's for sure. It's just me, with my same height, increasing my "inches". Therefore, May 22, 2004, I am going to stop eating snacks. I'm going to have my three meals everyday, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and that's all. I have a horrible habit of always eating. It has got to stop. So now it has  I feel like i'm going through changes right now, but i don't know what they are yet. I mean, not much has been happening to me lately. I've been really sad, and kinda low for a while at school. I think its that empty void of walking the hallways with no one to look forward to. Sarah isn't there anymore. During tutorial, i have been getting ahead in pre-cal and doing work in the library. It's so deathly quiet in there and I hate it. I hate this silence. I miss the constant static in my head, and the continuous buzzing when I knew I could catch a glimpse of sarah for 10 seconds during passing period. I'm sorry that I'm getting all emotional. To make a long story short, I miss her at school.   But these changes are making me feel strange. I feel detached from everything and everyone. I've lost that sharpness and edge. Its probably the extra weight that's making me feel insecure. I don't like looking in the mirror yet. Maybe someday I will, but i am waiting for that day. What's changing? I don't know. I'm about to turn 16, yippy. Age is but a number. But I just don't know what is coming over me. I have got to figure this out before it kills me. I'm changing, but I don't know what I'm changing.   A few more days of school left and we're finally juniors. That sounds really old, but its not very when you have a girlfriend who is a freshman in college. I sound so young, don't I? I'll miss her while she's at Northwestern. We'll be okay though. It will be tough, I won't deny that. But we can do it.   I feel that I have a lot of potential of basically doing anything that I want once I am outside of highschool. But i am so scared that i will never figure out what i actually want to become in life, a passion of a career. Of course I will have sarah, but i'm worried i won't find my perfect career. Something that I love doing. I'm capable of a lot right now, but how is it in the real world? I'm just in this microcosm of a school and society, not out of my shell yet. What is to become of me?  Sorry, I am drifting off into my surreal world. Now back to reality. Me and Sarah went to go see Godsend tonight. It freaked me out, but it was just a really bad movie. I always get scared in suspensful movies, so that's why it freaked me out. I had a good time with her though. We fought a little today, which always hurts, but we got through it. I love you sarah. She's asleep already though.  Have a good night everyone! bye

      hey all, sarah here.  taylor and i have noticed a few less-than-supportive comments on our blog.  there's just a few things i would like to say about that.  and let me clarify that when i say "you" i mean a universal you, not one person in particular.  if you disagree with our lifestyle, that's fine.  i'm not going to tell you what to believe.  you have every right to think whatever you want, and we have every right to live however we want.  and i understand that by putting a comments section on our blog, we are opening ourselves up to negative feedback.  your freedom of expression allows you to say what you want in those comments, just like our freedom of expression allows us to say what we want in the blog.  but if you think that telling us that being gay is wrong or that we're going to hell is going to make us change in any way, you are sadly mistaken.  we love each other, and that is not going to change, no matter what anyone says or does to us.  so by telling us that girls kissing girls is wrong, you are simply wasting your time and effort.  i think we would all be much happier if you left us alone.  honestly, if you don't like it, don't read it.  it's that simple.  i'm not going to tell anyone that i think their lifestyle is "wrong".  who am i to decide what is right for another person?  and i think it should be the same for everyone else.  if you don't like how we are, i'm sorry, but that's too bad.  and i don't think that i should be treated badly because of who i happen to fall in love with.  if god really does hate gays, and is going to condemn us to hell, let him do it.  don't take it upon yourself to judge us.  and why are you so intent on our salvation anyway? i'd think you wouldn't want lesbians up there in heaven with you.  "let he who is without sin cast the first stone" or something like that.  sorry i'm not perfect with my bible quotes.    but anyway, that's pretty much all i wanted to say.  i just wish i could live my life free of harrassment from other people.  these aren't the dark ages anymore.  we don't burn gays at the stake.  *kiss* to taylor -- whether you like it or not.

      hey all, sarah here.  there's really no point in repeating everything taylor said about today, so i'll just add in a few details.  deva's death affected me more than i thought it would. i did cry. it's just... hard. there's nothing i can really say here without sounding corny, so i'll stop. you all get what i mean.  i loved being with taylor today. we did go swimming, which was so much fun with her! hehe. then i needed somthing new to wear, so i took an old banana republic shirt with a little tie up thing on it, took the string out, and cut it halfway down the front, then wore it with a white halter top that i don't think i've ever worn before. i think that's the first time one of my little impulsive creative things has ever actually worked.   we went to virgin megastore in the mall before the movie, and i got a cd called "rock against bush". it's all songs about different artists talking about how horrible of a president bush is. it's so great!  taylor looked BEAUTIFUL tonight. she wasn't being conceited, trust me. she was just being honest.   i'm always a bit of a wreck when i have to drop the love of my life off at her house and drive away. i can't wait till i can be with her every night. i miss her every second i'm away from her. i'm going to stop being all sappy now, but i just have to say that taylor is everything that is good in my life, and i'm so lucky to love her.

      hey all, its taylor =)  Today was.. interesting. It was divided into three parts. 6:00 am - 10:00 am was horrible and just devastating. There was a loss today, Deva Sauls. It was a solemn day, and I hope everyone can wish her many good things. She'll be alright, wherever she is. She can take care of herself  10:00 am - 3:00 pm Good!! I shopped with my mom, which was actually a lot of fun. We went into Banana Republic. It was the first time that i had ever been in there. I really really like it. I bought a lot of stuff. I got some Birkenstocks, they're very cool. Some guys tried to hit on me in there because i was in a short skirt and probably flashed them once or twice. I really wanted to tell them i was a lesbian, but i basically just played off my young age thing. They sort of backed away after that.  3:00 pm - 11:00 pm  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING . Sarah picked me up from my house and we went to her house. We went SWIMMING for about an hour and a half. I'm sorry, but i had so much fun. I hadn't gone swimming in forever. Plus, with Sarah, its much more fun! haha.  We then ate her mom's famous chili, which is to die for. After that, we went to a movie. we saw Shrek 2. It was sooooo funny. Now i get the "thong" thing everyone is talking about. Now, i'm at home, missing sarah. But tonight was such an incredible night. I wore a new shirt from banana republic tonight, and it looks really cool. I kinda looked pretty for once. Sorry, i'll stop being conceited, okay done. Hehe. I hope everyone tried to have a good day. I certainly did. There's good things out there. I, the luckiest person in the world, have found my good thing. It's you, Sarah.  bye

      Hello all  Well today just became solemn. Last night, May 20, Deva Sauls passed away with cancer. She didn't want to do treatment and it finally reached her heart. I feel really horrible now. I don't know what to think. I'm just sad. I hope everyone is okay.  *kiss to sarah*  bye everyone

      Hey everybody, this is taylor posting..  Right now i'm in computer science because i was too tired to update last night after i did my laundry. I'm sorry sarah!! I had such a GREAT day yesterday. Everything just went well. I'm very excited about it. So anyway....  School: -      This is my last day, may 21, of computer science. tear? nah -      Yesterday *Lolley interupts to say hi to everything and everybody out there, ...so um hi* was a really good day at school -      We're reviewing in all my classes now, so its pretty boring -      Elections were yesterday! I voted for chelsea duran, lauren messer, may moayad, and alex boyd-rogers -      That's basically it  So i had an amazing day yesterday because i got to see sarah. I hadn't seen her since monday. I missed her so so so so so so much!!!! she picked me up from my doctors appointment. It was so funny!! ahem! anyway, we went to her house, and i got to eat ramen noodles and more food. yummy. Her house is my sanctuary. After that, we went to go see desperate measures. Oh, i wore her clothes. They're so much more comfortable than mine. We got sno-cones on the way to casa manana.   The play was, well, pretty bad. It was flat, dull, had no life in it. We really didn't enjoy it. There were a few parts that were really funny, but the rest was just tiring to watch. So we left after the first act and went to barnes and nobles. I love looking at books with sarah. I wanted to buy her everything she wanted in there. She has such an incredible mind, brilliant. I just love seeing her glow. Okay, i'll be done with that now.  Sarah, i had a great day yesterday. You are the best ever! I am so lucky and so honored to know you and be with you. Thank you for giving me a chance!  I'll update later, today should be a good day too! I get to see sarah again!

      hi people.  sarah here.  my day was thoroughly dull until i got to see taylor.  i spent the day watching tv and making hemp jewelry.  i really need a job.  then i went and picked taylor up and we hung out at my house for a little while, then we went to casa manana to see a musical called desperate measures.  taylor wore my clothes, of course, cuz she just had her uniform.  it was... well... bad.  it was dull and boring and just had no life.  so at intermission we left and went to barnes & noble.  we got starbucks and wandered around.  i saw some books i desperately wanted but i held back.  be proud of me for my self-restraint.  i'm so bad with splurging on books.  wow i'm a dork.    i was so nervous driving home cuz my car is on empty.  almost below empty.  but i didn't have my credit card so i couldn't get gas.  i'm so glad i got home.  anyway, today was a great day cuz taylor and i got to see each other and spend all afternoon together.  we are so in love.  *dreamy sigh*  lol yeah we know we're that annoying couple that everyone hates.  but what can ya do?

      Hello all, this is taylor  Seems like Sarah had a  GREAT  time in Evanston today! She got to go all over the Northwestern campus. Damn, that seems so awesome. Too bad that I'm too stupid to get in there. Oh well, I'll go to some low-quality public school with my intelligence and GPA level near her. There's sure to be some artsy people there.  So i got home, was kind of tired. I turned on the tv, and wrote to you guys. After that, I laid in my bed and watched TLC, The Last Chapter- VH1 Behind The Music. I started crying for some reason. Over nothing. After that, I started watching VH1 No Doubt (the complete history) or something like that. I knew Sarah would like that.   After I finished making my brain turn into liquid with all of the TV, i went to my brother's Sports Banquet, because my parents wanted to make it a "Family Event". Yeah those are almost always pretty crappy evenings. Jeff kicked and yelled at me and hurt my feelings so incredibly much. I was doing him a favor of letting him go out into the car. I can't believe he did that. IHe kept stopping and not following my directions. I just had to finally pick him up.  know I shouldn't take it personally, but when you're looked at by everyone around you holding a screaming child because HE wanted to go to the car, you feel a little bit sh*tty. I did. After that, I thought my dad didn't see Jennifer Moser and her friend crossing the road, so i yelled my dad to stop with this horrible agony in my voice, and my dad just threw it in my face. I'm sorry, but i was so terribly distraught already, that it didn't help. I cried all the way back home. Fortunately, my dad didn't ask what was wrong until i got home. I just said nothing and go away. That's all for now. I love you sarah. bye

      wow it's been a long day.  sarah talking.  well, here we go.  i got up at 5:00 this morning to catch our flight.  that was basically uneventful.  my dad and i chickened out on the whole train thing so we just took a taxi to and from the airport.  it worked out really well.  i'd forgotten how much i love northwestern!  just the whole feel of the place.  we checked out dorms, even though we couldn't go inside (you have to have an id card).  we found the library, which is enormous and only has one entrance and exit to better monitor stuff, so you can get trapped very easily in there.  we ate lunch in the student center, which was full, and i mean FULL of kids doing different stuff.  there was one chick by herself reading a book who looked like someone i would hang out with.  there were three kids sitting at a table with a guy who looked like a professor, having a discussion.  there were girls making posters, kids reading newspapers while they ate, and just a whole slew of kids doing their own thing.  i loved it.    all along the sidewalk there are pieces of paper taped to the ground that advertise things going on around the campus.  they're performing "the taming of the shrew" this month in case you wanted to know, and the pi delta phi sorority is hosting a pi phi pie phight.  lol.  some were political, and said BEAT BUSH!  others were about gay marriage.  those were great.  they said stuff like, "heterosexual marriage has existed for thousands of years, and has NEVER changed.  blacks can't marry whites, women are property, and divorce is illegal." or "obviously, gay parents will raise gay children.  since straight parents only raise straight children." or "legalizing gay marriage will open the door to ridiculous behavior.  people will marry their pets, because dogs have legal standing and can sign a marriage document with their opposable thumbs." or "civil unions that provide all the benefits of marriage are better.  because 'separate but equal' institutions are constitutional and ALWAYS WORK." or "gay marriage will make straight marriage less meaningful. because britney spears' 55-hour marriage was meaningful." or "gay marriage is not supported by all religions.  in a theocracy like ours, one religion rules the entire country.  that's why there is only one religion in the united states."  i think that's all of them.  and they all had little smiley faces on them.  anyway, i thought those were great.  we went to the campus store and bought some stuff.  we got bailey a purple onesie with "northwestern wilcats" on it and a little t-shirt.  i looked in the girls' section and they automatically assume that if you're female you want something pale pink or baby blue, so i got a gray long-sleeved shirt with northwestern written in white with a pink outline.  then i got a little kid's shirt that's black and says "northwestern wildcats" on it.  my parents got shirts too.  and i got a little wildcat beanie baby type thing.  we walked a little in downtown evanston, to the train station and the starbucks and stuff, just to look around.  it was about sixty degrees all day, i loved it.  i'm reading the da vinci code, and oh my god i cannot put it down!  it's so great.  i only have about 100 pages left and i have GOT to finish it tonight.  my dad actually got a little annoyed with me cuz i kept pulling it out every time we sat down and he kept telling me i should be observing the campus.  lol.  okay i'm done now.  wow that was a long post.

      Hey Everybody! Its taylor here. Two more days until the weekend! I don't know why I'm looking forward to it. My parents are going to make me stay home all weekend and study. Urggg. Ah well, sometimes that happens. Friday night i hope me and sarah can go somewhere together. Thursday, i get to see sarah, which is good. She's been in chicago all day today. I hope she's been having fun. We're doing great, very much in love, and the relationship is still going very strong. Anyway..  School: -      Very boring today actually. I probably just missed sarah.  -      English, we finished in The Importance Of Being Earnest -      Pre-cal... he's been annoying by taking up homework every day, but that's okay =) I at least had its done, so its quite alright -      Chemistry! We have so much work to do on that exam review, i'll do it though -      My study halls were boring today, but good  Okay basically that's all about school. I just am really bored right now. I miss sarah desperately and can't wait until she gets home. Plus i'm watching a depressing show, haha. I just, i don't know, i'm kind of blank right now. Oh, and I am taking AP Chemistry now, but if there's too much work at first interim, i'm going to drop. I'll post some more later i suppose. I hope everyone had a good wednesday. two more days.  bye

      hi everybody, its taylor once again..  Well my night has been pretty much uneventful, not too busy that is. I talked to sarah finally around 4:00, we talked for about an hour or so. I miss her so much when I'm away from her. After that i went to Hibachi with my family. I stuffed myself, and I missed sarah, but I had some fun. Then I got home and talked to sarah for a bit. She had to go fix her computer because spyware is taking over..  So, I, the hopeless romantic desperately waiting to get away from this place, started looking up Chicago apartments under or at $600. I found a few that looked really good. I hope I can live in Chicago with Sarah some day. I want to go to college somewhere in illinois so that i can visit Sarah at Northwestern. I know I couldn't get in there, but maybe somewhere a little less "Educated" and "Hard to get into"  Now, Sarah and I are talking on the phone. Then, i'm going to go to bed. I'm already pretty tired. Good night everyone. Have a good wednesday tomorrow. *hug* to sarah  bye

      hey everyone, this is taylor! I just got home about 10 minutes ago from school. Wow what a boring day. I see sarah had an uneventful day too, hehe. Ah well, I'm sitting here with Jack (one of sarah's dollys that she gave me to take care of, isn't that sweet?!) he's sitting in my lap.   So anyway, I'm listening to R.E.M-Losing my religion. I got a 100 on my Sweeney Todd test, actually i started with a 97 but he curved. I wish i had done better =/ *sigh* oh well. Oh now i'm listening to a song by smile empty soul, i think its called "this is war" (my cd player is on random shuffle) How was everyone's day? School was really really boring today..   School for tuesday:  -  It wasn't too bad. Finished all of my homework at school, so that always feels good. -  Ms. Langley made us all feel a little guilty today for not taking AP Chemistry next year. Should i do it? I want to have an easy year... but i like chemistry.. is it worth it? Comment on if i should take it or not.  -  We're doing calculus in pre-cal right now. Its not too bad. I get it *somewhat*  -  Umm... english, we're still reading The Importance Of Being Earnest -  Had our Sweeney Todd test, wish i had done better, but i'm still doing well in the class. I knew that play too! grrr -  Made my own lunch today. I packed myself some microwavable macaroni and cheese and i made it in the teacher's lounge. It wasn't too bad. i just got thirsty, but oh well. hehe -  Hmmm, what else, I really enjoy this 3-study hall thing. Its VERY very nice, i can finish all or nearly all of my homework every day! So awesome... hehe -  Campaigns started today for the Executive Council. I wish every one good luck! Just try your best. I don't know who I'll vote for yet. I rate depending on speeches, haha.  Okay I believe that is all for school today. I just got home, so i'll probably post some more later on tonight. I hope everyone has a good afternoon and evening. I don't know where Sarah is. I hope she texts/IM's/calls me soon! bye bye

      how's everybody doing today?  sarah here, and i'm doing alright.  today's been pretty uneventful so far.  i've been texting taylor all day because she's at school.  i can't wait till she's done.  only a little while longer sweetie!  my dad and i are going up to northwestern tomorrow for a day trip.  we're leaving the house at 5:30 am (yikes!).  then we're going to try to do the train thing from the airport to the campus.  that involves taking a train to downtown chicago, then a bus to a metro, then the metro to the campus.  wish me luck!  i'll need it.  it'll be an adventure, that's for sure.  i started the da vinci code last night.  i'm not very far into it but it seems pretty good so far.  hopefully it'll be long enough to keep me entertained on the plane tomorrow.  oh and i did my own laundry last night too!  go me.  yeah my mom cut me off from her free laundry service which really pisses me off cuz she just now stopped doing daniel's laundry and he's 19!  i'm 17!  technically i should get two more years.  she says she's doing it for my own good so i'll be ready for college, but in reality all she's doing is making me more economical cuz i'll wear my clothes five or six times without washing them.  lol.  but i guess i really shouldn't bitch cuz i should be doing my own laundry by now.  taylor and i are doing great, in case you wanted to know.  relationships are certainly not easy, and definitely something you have to work at, but it's all worth it.  we are still so in love.  kisses to taylor!  i'm out.

      hey, its taylor everybody  Today's may 17, a monday. How was everyone's monday? Mine was pretty good. It had its ups and downs we will say =)  School:     -I turned in my Computer Science exam that I did saturday night, so i feel pretty accomplished in that class. Its a good feeling. I don't get that often. I always forget something, hehe.    -Study hall, i wrote my history paper, and it turned out alright. I read my email, it made me feel pretty damn crappy, but sarah helped me out. If you don't know what happened, read the previous blog entry. Pretty cowardish though. That's all i have to say    -English kind of cheered me up but not much. I should have been happier, but i stayed in my funk. We read The Importance of Being Earnest, which is really funny. So I enjoyed it =)     -Tutorial I sat in the library and tried to do my pre-cal homework for tonight, we're starting calculus! aah! hehe    -Pre-cal I finally figured out how to do the homework, haha    -Chemistry was good mainly because it distracted me from my mind. I kept myself busy. I finished the rest of chem homework during lunch    -During AP European (aka Study Hall) Did more homework, got ahead in some stuff, yippee.... haha    -Watched Sweeney Todd during acting, we have a test tomorrow! wish me good luck    -During Choir (aka Study Hall) Talked to Mr. Newberry the whole time  Okay, so my school day was pretty much emotional. But nothing really bad happened. Just shooken up. And i didn't get to have lunch so i was very fatigued and my knees were giving out.  Sarah picked me up from school and made me go walking with her, it made me feel MUCH better (thank you sarah). After that, I made us smoothies, another fun activity. then we just finished watching Love Actually. So she made my day really good. Overall my day was pretty good. I don't know how she did that! Thank you so much Sarah!  I'll post later if i feel, but that's all for now. I hope everyone had a good monday! 9 days of school left! yay..

      hey guys, sarah here.   it seems like taylor gets to post all the fun happy stuff.  well i'm here to bring everybody back to reality.  with all the support taylor and i have recieved after coming out and everything, i think we've forgotten about the hate that still exists in the world.  this became very apparent to us when taylor opened her email account and found some shocking things.  she has a link to a little quiz for friends to take about her, and when you finish you put your name and email address and send it to her with your results.  well this person (we think they were all sent by the same person) sent nine emails, with names and email addresses like: god condemns you to hell lesbo at godhatesyou@whatsyourproblem.youregoingtohell die please taylor and sarah too at deathisyourbestoption@timetodie.leavethisworldugay please kill yourself soon at dielesbobitchyoureugly@killyourself.leaveusnow you disgust the world. stop life at youareuglylesbo@whydoyoutorturesociety.soveryugly  and others.  this always comes as a shock, especially when we really haven't encountered it before.  it's interesting to note, however, that this person did not have the guts to use their own email account because then we could email him (or her) back.  funny how the ignorant bigots tend to be cowards.  it's so hard knowing that this is only the beginning of the hate that's in store for us, simply for loving each other.

      Alright! i am so incredibly sorry that i haven't updated in FOREVER. this is taylor. i am going to start working on this CONSTANTLY. okay well this is the first post of today. i'm going to do this. what has been happening?! I've been having a good two weeks. Sarah and I are still very much in love and very happy. I'm sure you needed to know that...  May 8 was prom! How fun was that!?!?!? I hope everyone had fun! Everyone looked amazing!!!! Jarrett, Lolley, Courtney, Morgan, Ashley, Taylor. Everybody looked great!! It was really really fun. And so was Survivor Island! I kinda got a little whiplash but that's alright! Survivor Island was definitely a hit though. That's for sure. =). Good Job Bonnie!! You did a fabulous job!!   Monday, May 10 was Betty Buckley Awards. Although we didn't win anything, it was still a very incredible experience.   Then we had a choir concert on May 11. It was very sad! I mean really. Mr. Ice told the choir that he was "officially" retiring. We all started crying. I definitely did.  Senior dinner was really great as well. It was wednesday May 12. The senior video was cute. Sarah had awesome pictures! There was this one of her when she was like 10 months old looking at the camera. She looked so adorable!!! I'm sorry, i'll stop with that now.   Mark and Jeff had their spring show on Friday, May 14. It was also an auction, my dad spent a lot of money, hahaha. They did really good! I was so very proud of them. Sarah came with me. I know she really didn't WANT to or HAVE to for that matter, but she went anyway. She's such a sweetheart.   Graduation was Saturday, May 15. So sad!!!!! Sarah did such an amazing job on her speech. I was so proud of her. Congratulations class of 2004. They're graduated. Haha. I'm sure everyone is very happy. We then ate at Pappadeaux. I stuffed myself!! Oh wow. But anyway..  Sunday, May 16. I got to spend the day with Sarah. It was a lot of fun. We ate at La Madeleine. Now back to school... How fun! Only one more week until finals! pretty awesome! Alright well i'll Post some more later! =D!!!

      Hey you guys, It's taylor.   Wow! It's been a long time since we've been able to post! How are you? (whoever is reading this) I'm doing well. Sarah seems to be doing well. My throat has been hurting for the past 24 hours, but I'm getting better. We (Sarah and me) are doing great as well!   She has AP tests this week! Good luck Sarah! Calculus is going to be hard. I wish I could help ya. I'm sorry that I can't. You'll do fine! Alot of the sophomores are taking AP European, which they are going to ROCK on! You guys will do just fine! He's over-prepared you all. Good luck to everybody (especially Sarah, even though she doesn't need it)   Alllllrighty then... Let's start with.. friday? Okay, friday. Thursday felt like a Friday last week, so Friday was difficult to get through. I had voice lessons and then I drove straight to Casa Manana to have a meeting with Valerie Galloway-Chapa (Director of Education and Outreach). Basically, the meeting was about this week's recital and how I have to help. So I'm working after school all week this week (so much Fun... hehe, it'll be KINDA fun) After that, I had my LAST, I repeat  LAST  Casa Kids friday rehearsal! I cried like a BABY! We had to talk about what was our high point, something we learned, etc.. It was so sad. And then they changed the time of the saturday performance, so I couldn't perform!! I miss them already! hehe *tear* I cried so much. They really liked me. I didn't think they would. They were my only friends back in october. Isn't that weird?! I'll keep in touch with them. I love u guys!   After Casa Kids crying session, I got to go to a movie with Sarah and Andrew! YAY! hehe. I was walking to Sarah's car, I saw her hair cut!!! IT LOOOKS SO GOOD!! She DYED it! Her hair is no longer a virgin... hehehe! Anyway, I think it looks amazing! Sarah, you look stunning, I love it! We went to go see Mean Girls at tinseltown. It was ACTually pretty good (Aaaah! I didn't just say that) Yeah I did. It was pretty good. It started storming friday, kinda scary.   Alright we're up to Saturday. Haha, I should have posted earlier, this one's long! Around 12:30, my father, Sarah, and I started driving up to Oklahoma to see Chess at OU. We stopped around 2 at Macgeehee's and had catfish... mmmm.. sooooooooo good! After that my Dad showed us where he used to live in Oklahoma city, where he went to school, some of his favorite places.. It was kind of interesting. After that, we went to Hideaway's, a pizza place where my cousin works. It was really good!!! *yummmmy* So then.. we got to see Chess! woooww. We did some things WAY better than they did and they did some things WAY better than we did. Their One Night in Bangkok was AMAZING! They had a drag queen in it. Oh...... my....... god! It was incredible!! He was COOL! Oh wow, ask me about it on monday! Pity the Child was sooooo good too! They had him snorting cocaine so the song was kind of surreal and stuff. It was neato... Anyway! We got home at 2:00 in the morning. I was so tired.   Sunday. We had voice recital. Some people were absolutely amazing, I wasn't. Ah well, not everyone can be good. I'll take the hit. It's fine. I got to go to Cheddar's with Sarah afterwards, so I was okay. I'm going to go lay down for a while. I don't feel good. *kiss* to Sarah. bye bye

      hey all that reads the sarah/taylor blog, taylor posting...  How is everyone doing? I have been reading constantly for the past two days, breaking right now to write to you guys. I'm ALMOST done with Catch 22. After that i'm going to read the Crucible, and while i'm on my european trip, i'm going to read The Grapes Of Wrath. I'm getting really excited about my trip.  Catch 22 is actually a good book. Its hard to get into, but it gets better after a while. I'll post later, I'm going to go call sarah, and then read some more.  *kisses* to sarah, everyone have a great week

      Hey All that read our blog whenever you are bored, Taylor posting for the Sarah/Taylor blog.       We haven't been keeping up and I am really sorry for that. I guess its summer and we're both really lazy and don't feel like we have really anything to talk about. Summer has been pretty good for me (well i'll go with OK) and its been OK for Sarah too. It's just kind of bleh.       My last day of work was Friday, June 25. I'll miss being awake in the mornings because I know I'll sleep in now. I haven't been able to do that yet, and I like it. It keeps me awake for awhile. If I sleep in, I feel that I've wasted half the day. Does anyone else feel like that? Probably not, but it might be nice to sleep in for a week.   After that I'm going to Europe.      You know, honestly, I'm really excited about it. The thought of packing and getting organized, taking pictures when I'm there, being with ashley and jenny and katy, sounds very intriguing and exciting. But there's just a constant anxiety of what if I get homesick? What am I going to be able to do about it? And I just love sarah so DAMN MUCH that I don't want to leave her for 16 days! I mean we'll make it of course, but I don't want to be away from her that long, especially because she's still in Texas and not in Chicago yet (well Evanston actually, but that's besides the point).       The point is is that I should be excited about it and already packing now, but i'm not. I know I'll have fun, but I want to be with Sarah so badly. She wants me to have fun , I know that, but I know she'd rather me stay here. I would too if I was her. Not "stay here" persay but never have learned about it in the first place. Italy was hard enough. We're strong though, as a couple. We will make it through. I'll be missing our 7 month anniversary, but that isn't a huge milestone, so that's good. God I just love her so much. She's amazing. I'll have fun. I know I will.      Well what else? I was watching Totally Gay and Totally Gayer on VH1 today. It is so much fun for me to watch shows like that. They're so rare that I need to cherish them while they're on. I think pretty soon Gay will be normal. Of course there will always be people that have problems with it. That's completely normal as well. I don't know. I'm so happy that our generation is more open minded. Open minds make the world go round. We would be dead if even a few people didn't have open minds.       To keep ranting along the same lines of my generation, I am really excited about being juniors. I wonder if my class is united. The senior class of last year was really really REALLY divided. The senior class this year is  pretty  united, but not quite. I don't know. To me, I don't think we are united. That's okay though. I think we're a pretty good class, and I'm glad that I'm in it. We have so many talented people, whether in the arts, academics, or sports. I'm excited about my class schedule this year as well, I hope I get the classes I want.      I want to really focus on AP Chemistry as well too. Honors Chemistry last year was just FASCINATING to me. I don't know WHY I liked it so much, but i did. I really really hope they make that class. But if they don't, i'll take environmental science. I'm taking AP Eng as well and AP Calc. I don't know, to me it sounds like a tough year, but I really want to devote myself to it. I think I can do it. I really want to.      I'm really insecure. I think most of you know that out there. Yeah, you do. If you didn't know, I really don't like myself. I need to get over that too because you need to be comfortable with yourself before you can be comfortable on stage. Fortunately I've had characters in plays that it doesn't really apply. I don't know, being insecure has made me become tense and stressed and always on edge. I'm very anxious all the time. I work myself up too much. Some other people do that too, I know.       Well i am getting tired and so I think I will go to bed. I hope everyone is having a good summer. I love you Sarah. Take care everybody, I'll try to post monday or so because tomorrow I'm going to Oklahoma to deliver my grandpa (Papa) his birthday present. I won't be back until 11:00 or so.   *KISSES* to Sarah!!!

      I'm not doing too well right now. I mean, i don't post very often anymore, so that's a big clue. In fact, that's an extremely obvious clue that I'm not doing very well. I know Sarah is trying to fix it, but its not working. I wonder if it can be fixed...  I don't know what else to say. Friday is my last day of work. I feel like shit. I'm miserable right now.  *kiss* to sarah. i hope she'll accept it

      Oh, I haven't posted in a long, long time, have I? I am so sorry for that. Time has been so confusing and yet so fast and slow all at the same time. My life has taken tangents and turns I didn't want it to take. This is taylor blogging for the sarah/taylor blog. Its going to be somewhat long.   First of all, Sarah had a wonderful birthday. I don't think many of you understand how fully remarkable sarah is. She just makes me alive. I didn't know i could put so much trust in to one human being. Its unreal. I have given her my life and she has kept me so alive and so unbelievably happy. Skeptics would say i'm just infatuated and too young to know what love is. I don't think they're right, but i'll give them a chance. I'll prove it to them. I love you so much Sarah. Nothing will ever be so large that we can't fight through. We have gotten through so much already. She is my miracle. She saved me from a life that i didn't want to live anymore. I know it all sounds so cliche. Perhaps it is. I don't care what its called.   Me, her mom, and her celebrated her 18th birthday. I just was beaming all day, so full of joy and happiness for HER. I wanted Sarah to have the best birthday that she could possibly have. I worked alot on her present and such. She loved it. I am so glad that she did. She made me happy too. We took her to Red Lobster, and I enjoyed food that I never would have tried if I hadn't have met Sarah. She got a digital camera from her parents and has been taking pictures since. I really hope her birthday was special. I sure tried to make it good for her.   Work has been pretty much uneventful. The usual kids, with the usual unusual perks and smiles that can make me inevitably happy. I really do enjoy children. Friday night, my dad wanted to talk to me about some things that I started to take very personally. Basically, one thing led to another and our lives became out of the control of anyone. I couldn't control my life, my dad couldn't control his. We were trapped in this hell hole of no returning except by some little fate and hope beyond our reach friday night, saturday, and sunday. He left after our fight and didn't return until late saturday night. I felt lost. I felt that there was nothing I could do. I didn't do anything wrong. I just, didn't understand, that's all. Its all better now. That's all I can say. Life sometimes is like a tornado. Most of the time it completely misses you, and life is normal. But sometimes it gets picked up in the tornado and then we are spat back out, trying to arrange things to how they were before.  I love life sometimes. I miss sarah. I'm really doing pretty good right now. I'm getting a little excited about europe, but extremely anxious. I'm going to miss sarah so much. I hope she is okay without me. We can make it. We always do.

      Twelve Reasons Gay Marriage Will Ruin Society  1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control are not natural.  2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people cannot get legally married because the world needs more children.  3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children because straight parents only raise straight children.  4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.  5. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and it hasn't changed at all: women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.  6. Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.  7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are always imposed on the entire country. That's why we only have one religion in America.  8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people makes you tall.  9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage license with his opposable thumbs.  10. Children can never succeed without both male and female role models at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.  11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans.  12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages will for gays and lesbians.   i love this.  it just shoots down every argument against gay marriage.  spread the message: copy and paste this into your blog or xanga or whatever if you like it too.

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!  sarah here. i'm 18!  wow.  i'm an adult, according to the government.  haha what a joke that is.  i still watch cartoon network.  but i can vote!  so that's cool.  i had an AMAZING birthday.  the best ever.  i was woken up by the maids around nine, which sucked, but oh well.  i got showered and went to get taylor from casa manana.  we came back to my house and watched some episodes of sex & the city.  she gave me two really cute cards, one of which i will show anyone who wants to see cuz it's funny and i love it, the other is personal and private.  sorry guys ;).  she also promised me another AWESOME gift, but i'll announce that when it comes.  then we went to go see saved! cuz my mother said she's pay.  it was really good.  total christian bashing, lol.  highly recommended.    we came back and did the cake/present thing.  it was just my mom and taylor singing happy birthday to me, but they were good and loud and i couldn't have been happier.  my parents gave me a really kickass digital camera!  it's so tiny and awesome.  i love it.  i pretty much knew what they were getting me though.  but i was still happy.  then we went to red lobster.  i ordered the shrimp trio dinner and taylor got catfish.  my mom also got extra crab legs.  mmmm... yummy.  taylor tried everything, and i'm so proud of her for that!  she wasn't crazy about the shrimp, but she said the crab was pretty good.  so i may get her to be a seafood person yet.  hehe.  after that we came home and watched pirates of the caribbean.  i don't know where my copy is, so taylor let me borrow hers.  we ate some of the cake too, it was chocolate with whipped cream and fudge icing... yum.  i don't think i'll need to eat for three days after today's gorging, lol.  then i took taylor home, and here i am! i just want to say thank you to taylor for spending my special day with me, and dealing with my mother.  it means so much to me.   what a great day.  i'm out.  *kiss* to taylor

      hi all.  today is our 6-month anniversary!  wow.  i can't imagine my life before taylor.  it's like i've known her my entire life, but at the same time, it's gone by so fast.  and it's amazing that i've fallen in love so young.    okay i'll stop with that now.  i haven't done anything all day except play stupid internet games.  but in about half an hour i'm going to taylor's house, then we're going to simply fondue.  yummy!  that's definitely expensive enough to be a special occasion restaurant.  so yeah.  i don't really have anything to say.  sorry for such a short post.  *kiss* to taylor

      Hey you guys, Taylor posting for our blog. =)  How is everyone doing?!?!  I really hope your summer has been as awesome as mine and greater! I've been having to work 4 days a week. I hope no one has to do that. Although its really very easy. I only have to work until about 12:00 pm so it isn't bad at all.  Wow, okay last time I updated was a while ago! I need to get back on top of this!! Anyways.. About 10 minutes ago, I got home from Violet in Plano. This was the second time we went and it was great once again. Gavin, Leah, Courtney & her mom and dad, Alex, Jennifer(his date), and us were there. They all thought it was great! Anyone that hasn't seen it yet should go see it next weekend. You guys would love it!   Last night I went to go see Stepford Wives with Sarah and her mom. It's always a LITTLE tense when your girlfriend's mother is around, also because she's been a bitch to Sarah lately, but she's usually pretty friendly. She makes me a little nervous but I get over it. Well the movie was really great. We of course liked it because it had a lot of feminist qualities and depictions of strong women! That's always good!! I'm so glad I got to see that. The only other movie out right now that I want to see is Saved! I've heard that it's really really good. Maybe next week sometime. I first have to finish a book. Oh well. I'll do it.  Well approximately 35 minutes ago, our 6-month anniversary started! Hooray! I really think that it is an amazing thing. More importantly though, I think Sarah is an amazing person. On the same level of importance as that, I think  WE  are an amazing entity. I love her so much, and my passion for her is still burning strong even after 6 months. I'm amazed. Completely.  And to top off a great evening, I read our comments on Sarah's post before this one. Someone named Sabrina commented and said some incredible things! I can't believe we actually touched someone that we don't even know. When I told Sarah, she was ECSTATIC! Well anyway, that wraps it up for tonight, bye everyone! *kisses* to Sarah! Happy Anniverary Sweetie

      sarah posting.  i have got to get out of here.  i don't want to leave taylor, but i can't wait to get away from my fucking crazy mother.  she is ALWAYS annoyed with me, no matter what i do.  here we go.  we went to pick up my car today.  first she griped at me about my clothes because i was "showing too much skin" and she just wanted me to humor her for a few more weeks out of respect for her.  i was wearing baggy pants and a spaghetti strap top -- apparently any tummy at all is too much skin.  so i said "okay, is it just the tummy you don't like, or the shirt?"  and she said it was just the tummy, but then she got onto me about my bra straps showing.  aaarrg!  then she got mad cuz i brought her car home out of gas.  that, i will admit, is my fault and she was justified in that one.    then she got mad because i don't have a job.  "did you call about that job?  did you call the guy at the bookstore?  NO."  she said i "can't spend every day this summer with taylor" and that i have spent almost every day with her.  oh my fucking god.  how long was daniel out of school and unemployed??  four, five months???  jesus!  and finally, she got mad cuz i forgot to bring my wallet with my driver's license in it.  she started yelling about how i "can't get into that habit" and how i'll get a ticket and it'll be a pain to deal with.  she was just mad at me the whole fucking time!!  i try to appease her, but it never works.  i invited her to go to the movies tonight with taylor and me, and now she still wants to go.  GOD that's annoying.  you'd think she wouldn't want to be around someone who obviously aggravates her this much.  and when i asked for money, she was so damn stingy and once again, lectured me about how the spending is getting to be too much and it needs to slow down and i can't keep doing these movies and stuff.  and she wouldn't give me money for taylor.    i know i sound so childish by writing all this, but my mom used to be so cool!  she was my best friend a couple of years ago, and we would talk all the time.  i don't know what happened, or what i did to make her this irritated with me.  it makes me almost miss all my dad's shit.  yeah he's an asshole, but i know how to deal with him!  i can't yell at my mother or even get angry with her without severely regretting it, so i don't know what to do.  sigh

      hey all, its taylor posting..  Well not really TOO much to say. Hmm.. Summer's going well! Way too fast though. It needs to go back to about June 2 and the I'll be good. Too much to ask though. How is everyone ELSE's summer? Who has trips planned really soon? Comment and tell me about them. I think Jenny get's back on saturday from Sky Ranch! I hope she had a lot of fun =)  My birthday was yesterday! It was really a great day. I forgot about the whole being treated special on birthdays. It felt so good. I didn't do too much, but it was so cool to realize that alot of people DO love me and DO care about me. I forgot about that.   Yesterday morning, I woke up and opened one of my presents. It was a $50 gift certificate to DSW! Woohoo. I also opened my card that my parents got for me. On it, it says, "You're such a terrific teenager! So, for your birthday, we thought we'd hang out with you at the mall." Then inside it says, "Just kidding! Relax" haha. I thought that was funny.  I went to work and my first class sang me happy birthday after class time was up. Right before break was over my first class and basically all of the classes of that day sang me happy birthday! I got so embarrassed. You know how red I can become! Haha. My second class bought me cookies. Mmmmmm.. they were really tasty! I was so surprised!! Before I left to go home, Sarah Slaughter brought me into Valerie's office and gave me cupcakes and cookies! I was so happy! I had no idea they had planned this! They were so sweet. I wanted to cry!! Hehe.  Sarah picked me up at Casa. She opened the glove box and inside was a present that had Happy Birthday wrapping paper! I didn't think she was going to get anything! I really didn't expect any of this stuff. Inside were hemp bracelets that she made me!! I just about cried. I know how long those took her. They are so incredible. One of them has beads on it that say "Just Spin", one of my mottos because, first of all, I tend to spin alot for some reason. Two because it keeps me going and you should always continue to spin and live your life to the fullest extent. Another one of the bracelets had rainbow beads on it! It is soooo awesome.  Sarah, I love you.  Thank you.  We headed to Red Sand Archery to look at archery sets for Sarah. She really wants to get into that. They didn't really have anything she wanted because pretty much all of it was for hunting, and she's not looking to kill. Also, the "beginner" sets were Compound bows and she didn't need that. She wants a recurve bow or something like that. I'm not as informed about bows as she is, so I really have no idea what I'm talking about. Haha. Well because we couldn't find anything at Red Sand Archery, we went to Oshman's and they didn't have anything either. They had about 8 bows. What a great selection, Oshman's. Sheesh!   We went to my house after Red Sand Archery and Oshman's. We babysitted for a while and watched some TV. We watched A Knight's Tale and part of Pirates of the Caribbean. My grandma came over to cook my birthday dinner! Isn't that cool?! I opened my present from her. The bow for the present were 16 sugar cubes for "Sweet Sixteen" Cool huh?! That's what I thought! hehe. She gave me another $50 gift certificate to DSW and some euros for Europe in July. I thought that was a really cool gift. She doesn't usually spend that much on me! I was really surprised.   The dinner was sooo good! I was so happy that Sarah was with me. I can't believe she can actually love someone like me. =) Thank you Sarah for loving me! I opened my other presents.. I got a gift certificate created by parents that i can have any new computer system that I want! Cool? yes. I also got the game "Scene It". We played it after dinner. Sarah and I won! woohoo! We blew out my candles and at the cake that my mom made for me. My favorite cake, Lemonade cake. very cool. Thank you  Sarah and I played Mini-Games on Pokemon Stadium 2 with my brother for a little while and then had a great idea of going to Starbucks to get some coffee. Well about a mile out of my neighborhood, her check engine light turned on. Oh no! We pulled over and waited about 2 hours for the tow truck to get there! Such a great day to end my birthday, hehe. It was fun to wait with her. We listened to ABBA and danced in the street. Very fun! I hope her car is okay.   Well that's all for now. Work was great today! It went really fast. I got to talk to Andy Baldwin for awhile.  He's pretty cool. Someone to talk to at least! hehe. Umm.. what else? Sarah's almost here and we're going to go to DSW and then go watch a movie at her house. That's all. Have a great night tonight you guys!   Bye and *kisses* to sarah!!

      MY CAR DIED!!!  i was driving taylor to starbucks yesterday and the check engine light came on and then it would barely go up the hill and when i parked it somewhere and turned it off to call my mom the brake wouldn't depress so i couldn't get it out of park.  taylor called her dad and he came and sat with us until my mom got there and we listed to abba in the car.  so then we called hyundai roadside assisstance for a tow truck and it said it would be there in an hour so we waited and then when my automated call came and asked if my service had been recieved yet i pressed 2 for no and the girl told me that the truck came by and couldn't find us!!!  so i called for ANOTHER tow truck that would take 30 mins.  by this time i had to pee really badly so taylor and i took my mom's suv to the gas station to use the bathroom.  we were definitely the minority in there, cuz taylor lives right by the ghetto.  then when i tried to get my mother's mammoth of a car out of there i couldn't cuz there were some in the way so this guy helped us and i was VERY grateful.  when we got back to where my car was the tow truck was there.  my mom said he called and asked where we were and then found us right away.  so he took my car to the hyundai place and i don't know what's wrong with it yet or when i'll get it back.  hopefully soon.  *crosses fingers*

      hey everyone!  sarah here.  i know taylor just posted about the "us" stuff so i'm just going to do some "me" stuff.  sorry for being selfish.  i applied for a job at half price books yesterday, but i don't think i'm going to get it because the girl there said they get "so many applications."  she gave me the manager's phone number and told me to call and check up on my app cuz it might put me over the edge, so i think i'm going to do that tomorrow.  but anyway, my hopes aren't up.  anyone want to hire me?  i did my laundry yesterday too.  man is that a pain in the ass.  my mother cut me off so i have to do my own now.  i wear my stuff like 10 times before i wash it though, especially pants, unless i get something on them, so i don't have to wash much.  lol i'm a dirty kid.  but then i have so many damn clothes it takes 3 loads to do it all.    my mom's been really bitchy lately, so i'm trying to appease her with the applying for jobs and doing laundry stuff.  she doesn't like me spending so much time with taylor i guess.  i dunno.  she's always moody, but it's never been this bad for so long before.  you just never know what's going to set her off next.    taylor's birthday is tomorrow!  woot  there's something in my eye and it hurts so i'm gonna go deal with that.  bye

      Good evening everybody. I haven't really "posted" in a long while so i'll be sure to make this one long and informational. I suppose. Anyways! How has everyone's summer been? I really hope everyone is having a great summer! Mine has been really good so far. Kind of unsatisfying a little bit. It should pick up though. Maybe  Umm.. Let's see..Friday night we got to see Ashley sing at Johnnie High's. She did so incredibly well! I am just amazed at how beautiful her voice is. It can definitely make me melt. I wish I could be half as talented as she is! =) Congratulations Ashley! You did such a great job! you just rock! The revue was interesting. I can for sure say that i am not a country person now. The root beer was good! hahaha.  Saturday, Ashley, me, and Katy had to go to Cedar Hill to practice for the European music tour. The music really isn't that hard and it shouldn't take me long to memorize in fact. After I got home from Cedar Hill, Sarah picked me up and we headed for Plano! We stopped at a McDonald's to have salads. They're pretty good. We saw Violet at the courtyard theatre. It was sooooo good. Mr. Newberry played Monty, or Montgomery, haha. He did SUCH a good job! god DAMN he's a good actor! I was so worried we weren't going to be able to see him afterwards, but we did and he showed us backstage and introduced us to a few people. We felt like superstars. It was definitely the coolest thing! I was sooo glad we went. We're going to again this weekend. Hooray!  Sunday I went over to Sarah's house and watched But I'm A Cheerleader and If These Walls Could Talk 2. They were both really really good. It was so much fun to hang out and watch movies with Sarah.  Monday, work was pretty good =). One class that I assist in totally just stopped doing work and basically refused to work. It was sooo odd. They all began to say that they were tired and didn't want to work. Now granted they are 1st and 2nd graders, but they've never done that before. That night I basically sat around and watched VH1. That's always fun, isn't it?  Today, work was really fun. I enjoy the tuesday and thursday classes. Afterwards, I went to Lachlan's going away party hosted by Morgan. It was a LOT of fun! I am so glad that Morgan invited me! I really am going to miss Lachlan. He has touched a lot of people while he has been here. I'm going to miss seeing him laugh. I also saw Harry Potter tonight. I just got back from it. It was pretty good. I hadn't read the book in a while, so I thought it was fulfilling. Sarah, however, remembered more details from the book than I did and thought the movie unsatisfying. It was good nonetheless.  I'm getting a little tired. I need to go to bed soon. First I have to take a shower. Good night everyone. Oh tomorrow's my birthday, haha. *Kiss* to Sarah. Bye

      hi everyone!  it's sarah.  some stuff has happened, so here we go.  yesterday taylor and i went to plano to see mr. newberry's play.  it was SO GOOD, oh my god i loved it.  i never thought i'd see one of my teachers wearing only boxers, but ya know... hehe.  anyway, it was amazing and we're going back next week to see it again, and hopefully leah and gavin will come this time.  mr. newberry looked so happy to see us there; he walked out smiling and said "i didn't know you were going to be here!" and he showed us backstage and took us on the stage and stuff.  it was fun.  and next time he said we could get in free since we already paid once.  and oh my god.  he mentioned that gavin and leah were supposed to come and it was going to be like a double date, so he knows about us!!  yay!!!  that made us both so happy.  today i picked taylor up at one and we hung out at my house all day.  we watched two lesbian movies: but i'm a cheerleader and if these walls could talk 2.  it was fun, hehe.  so then i drove her home amidst a fantastic lightning storm, and it started really storming as soon as i got home, so for once the weather gods were on my side.   okay i'm out. *kiss* to taylor

      Hey you guys! wow i am tired! i've had a long day! Since tomorrow is Friday, no work! woohoo. I only have to work mon-thurs. Rock!  - Tomorrow, going to see Ashley at Johnny High's Country Music Revue. Good Luck Ashley! The whole family will be there.. oh god  Today I had sooo much fun. Work was a breeze because I worked with Sarah's Class, and they're cute! Sarah Slaughter that is.. not my girlfriend, hehe. We're all better now by the way from yesterday! Woohoo! After class, my mom came and picked me up (I know i'm still a little kid having to be picked up from work because i don't drive, boohoo) Sarah came and picked me up at 1:00, and we hung out at her house ALL day! What did we do!? We watched The Breakfast Club and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. We tried that Nair stuff. It works pretty well but it smells like SHIT and if your legs are dry, it stings a little bit for about 30 minutes. Its pretty easy though! We also went swimming which is always fun! Pigged out too.. yippy skippy! I'll never say that again..  We came back to my house and watched "This is Spinal Tap". It is hilarious! Everyone needs to see that movie! Hahaha, "Its more of a pastel black" *laughs* okay i'll stop rambling now! Tomorrow's friday! yay. Hope everyone had a great day and has another great day tomorrow! Oh, I'm almost 16..

      Hi everyone out there that reads our blog! Taylor posting...  Today has been, we'll call it a "rough day". I've started on a new short story. I hope it turns out half as good as any of Sarah's stories.   This morning, I woke up at 8:03 and got ready for work. It was pretty painless. Got done at 12:00 today. The kids are really cute. The third-fifth grade kind of think they know it all though. Oh well! I can't judge because i'm too young.  I got home and ate my subway sandwich. I talk to Sarah and she tells me she can't come over because of the storm. I have been depressed since. I haven't been this low in so long. I felt the world was going to end. I'll get off that subject now. Basically, we fought, and we overcame it. Everyone should be proud of us because it was a hell of a rough fight.   I don't really have anything else to say! Hope everyone has a good day tomorrow. Summer time is pretty great

      hi everybody! It's taylor posting for the "us" blog. How has everyone's summer been!? Oh wow! It's already been 5 days!! It's only seemed like one. Okay let's see..  Friday, May 28, 2004! -     Last day of my sophomore year. My crazy sophomore year. I'm really glad its over, but very sad at the same time. I'll write my description of my Sophomore year using adjectives that being with "s" (Remember: I'm a dork, so shut up). It was stressful, strange, and sexually awakening.  -     After my two tests which were both relatively easy, Sarah picked me up and we went to her house. Jenny and Leah came over for a couple hours and we pigged out on food and swam. It was soooooo much fun! =D. Lisa came over for about 30 minutes before Jenny and Leah had to leave! -     Me, Sarah, and Lisa swam some more and then watched three movies, Gothika, School of Rock, and Sixteen Candles. It was a lot of fun. I started to become a brat for a while because I felt that Sarah wasn't giving me enough attention. It was incredibly stupid of me.  Saturday, May 29, 2004! -    I was still in a pissed off/angry/depressed mood because of my stupid behavior from the previous day. I just layed around all morning, feeling like the world was going to end. Read a few pages in Catch-22.  -    Sarah tried to cheer me up. She's so sweet. Even though  I  was the one mad and angry, and she didn't do anything, she STILL tried to make me feel better. Is that love there or what? If that isn't love, I don't know what it is.  -    We went to Andrew's house that night to say goodbye to him because he was leaving for college on monday. We watched Spice World! It cheered me up a little bit. -    Started my diet this day.  Sunday, May 30, 2004! -    Basically happy by now, We went to Scarborough fair with Lisa and her parents. Okay it was hot, sticky, and sweaty, but I didn't get a sunburn AND it was a lot of fun -    I did really well on my diet still =) -    Sarah and I got into an argument about another stupid thing I had done. I swear, I fuck everything up. Anyway, we talked it out, and we're better now!  Monday, May 31, 2004! -    First day of Working out! Oh god!! Sore?? YES! -    My mom is cutting me off from laundry service, so I have been doing that non-stop monday and today. -    Sarah came over around 4:00 and fixed my computer! (well as much as she could) It runs alot better now. We then went to California pizza kitchen, and i DEFINITELY cheated in my diet. Yeah. -    Saw "The Day After Tomorrow" I don't care what people say. It was an EXTREMELY good movies. Very thought provoking and emotionally stimulating. I'd say go see it.   Tuesday, June 1, 2004! -    First day of working! I figured out that i don't have to work from 9-5 everyday, which I am extremely happy about! I mean, wow! I'm only working a "part-time" shift you could say. no pay, but its okay, i enjoyed doing it today. I'm working at Casa Manana. On Mondays i work from 8:30-1:00. Tuesdays are 9:00-12:00. Wednesdays are 9:00-1:00. Thursdays are 9:00-12:00. And i might stay afterwards any day that Valerie, the director of education and outreach, needs administrative work done. No work on fridays! YAY! -    Continuing laundry  Okay so that catches everyone up I believe. June 9, my birthday. June 13, ANNIVERSARY! yay! June 16, Sarah's birthday! There's some events that are coming up. Any more June birthdays out there besides Ashley's on June 13? Comment if you have a June birthday that I didn't talk about.   I hope everyone has had a great summer so far! I really have. I don't want it to end. I really don't want to go to Europe right now because I'm going to miss Sarah too much! Oh we got a new background. I hope you guys like it. It's only 16 days in europe so i should be okay. Sarah's optimistic about it, and she says that it's only 5 more days than the Italy trip. We're going to be alright! =). I'm going to be gone on our 7 month anniversary. Oh well! I was gone on our THREE month anniversary during Italy. I think that's a little worse! Haha! Anyways...I haven't gotten a tan, no sunburn at least, which is good. For the rest of the day today, I think I am going to work out again and read some Catch-22! I'll post later!  Bye and *KISSES* to Sarah

      Hi all ... This will be our last post until the 3rd of August, next Tuesday. Oh, so sad, I know. Not like anyone reads this anyway! haha. I hope people's summers are going well.. mine has gone very well so far! I am so happy that it has gone this well. Sarah and I are doing well. Still very happy and very in love. I'm sure that's too much information but I already wrote it and I'm too lazy to erase it. I'm so ... I don't know. (Exasperating)  I miss being busy though. We leave for Canada tomorrow! WOOT! I am so very excited. We won't be incredibly busy there persay, but it will definitely be fun. 7 days with Sarah, in CANADA, is going to be phenomenal.   My dad seemed mad at me earlier tonight. I hope he's not mad at me. It just worries me sometimes. We get along pretty well. I think we butt heads sometimes because we are very much alike... yeah we really are. It was really neat to spend some time with him and Mr. Newberry and Leah today. He's definitely a guy that gets stuff done. That's for sure. I, myself, am a procrastinator. There's something we have that is different! Dad, I'm sorry if I did something tonight that made you uncomfortable. I'm sorry.   Sometimes, I feel that I am not good enough. Who all feels like that? Um, everyone, yes. We all have our insecurities. We all feel that we aren't good enough.&nbsp;Have you ever caught yourself in a situation that you actually FELT like a typical teenager? I do that sometimes, where I feel that I am not good enough and then think about my age. Oh yes, I'm 14 or whatever, I should be insecure about not being good enough. I didn't catch myself today, but there was an incident that something just conflicted in my mind to where I couldn't even think straight enough to push it out of my head. I couldn't get around it to think clearly. Clearly enough to get around it. A mess of words all tangled in to one big mess. Of words. I feel non-poetic and utterly sophomoric.  Oh, sorry, I just needed to get that off my chest. I am still kinda shaky from earlier. I'm probably just tired. I need to go to bed. I hope everyone has a great next 7 days while we are in Canada! We're bringing movies, swimsuits, and books! What could be better?   Bye. *Kiss* to Sarah

      hey guys, sarah here.  taylor's at a meeting with mr. newberry (or michael, as i can now call him because i am no longer his student... hehe) about theater stuff for next year, and now i'm waiting to hear from her to see when we can pack together because WE'RE LEAVING FOR CANADA TOMORROW!!!&nbsp; woot!  i spent the morning doing laundry so all my clothes would be clean to pack, and playing neverwinter nights.&nbsp; i blame lisa for introducing me to that game and turning me into an even bigger dork than i was, lol.  i emailed my peer advisor, annie, about dorm stuff for northwestern.&nbsp; she said we'd be notified in the last week of july or first week of august, so i should find out pretty soon.&nbsp; she also gave me some good info about the dorms, like what furnishings are provided (bed, mattress, desk, dresser, closet) and that i might want to bring a fan cuz most dorms don't have air conditioning.&nbsp; in evanston, it's just not necessary most of the time.&nbsp; ha, that's different.&nbsp; she said that when i got my room assignment she could tell me more about my specific dorm.&nbsp; i'm glad that i know something about it and that things are starting to happen for school.  taylor and i will be back next tuesday, until then, see you in canada!

      hello! its taylor at 7:55 in the morning because I can't fall back asleep! WHINE!  How is everyone's summer going? Too short for me. Who's going somewhere this week? I AM!! Woot! Sarah has a lake house in Canada in Bobcaygeon. Did I spell that right, Sarah? I hope I did. We're leaving Tuesday, July 27 and come back Tuesday, August 3. I am SO excited!   The main reason why we get to go together is that I finished all of my summer reading! WOW! That's the first time I've ever finished all of my summer reading! You guys should really be proud of me. I even finished The Grapes Of Wrath in Europe =). I read about 30 pages a day or more every single day! What good work ethic I have when I have a reward after... I really liked The Grapes Of Wrath as well as Catch-22. They aren't too boring and both of them have incredible endings. I didn't do too well on my Crucible test, 85, but such is life.  Did you read Sarah's AP scores?! Oh My God, she did soo well! Nothing below a 4! That's incredible! I am in awe at all she does for me and for herself and for us. She's wonderwoman... haha. Congratulations Sarah. I am so honored to be your girlfriend =D!  Next year we will be doing Electra for our fall production and Sunday In The Park With George for our spring production. I am really excited about both of them! If you have even the SLIGHTEST desire to audition for either of them, do it! Its really a good experience to overcome stage fright and all of that good stuff. If you have any questions about either of the shows or should you audition and stuff like that, you can ask me. I'm not too scary.  Oh, I am also the Thespian Society president! Yay to me! haha. We will have a meeting at the beginning of the school year to talk about why we aren't doing Sweeney Todd and what Sunday In The Park With George is about. I think everyone will love it! I'll post more details about that later.   Sarah is going to be leaving soon... =(. That's going to be really hard. I don't even want to think about it yet. It isn't the end of the world though! I'll see her every three months, have email, write letters, talk on the phone. We can do it! I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.  WE  rock! (Sarah and I)  *kisses* to Sarah!

      hi .. its taylor posting for the Sarah/Taylor blog =)  I'm not in a very good mood right now, but I've missed posting, we'll see if this one is a long one. I haven't posted in so long! The summer has gone by really quick.&nbsp;I should be rested up though before school starts. That's good. I am exhausted right now. I don't know why. Not adjusted to the time change just yet..  Okay, so. July! I went to Europe! It was.. interesting. I had a good time, really I did, but I just missed home too much. First, we went to London.&nbsp;The flight there was just long! I read for some of the time, slept most of the time. It wasn't too long though, I'm used to long flights by now. London can be described as large and dirty. Its a really cool city though, reminds me of New York City. I did some shopping there, went to Harrod's but didn't get anything.&nbsp; Got Sarah some orange converse from London. We performed once there.   After London, we took a ferry and traveled to Paris. I really like Paris. I would rather live in London though, because I speak English. Paris was nice. I had already been to both of these places, so it bored me when we went on tours and such. The Louvre is ALWAYS nice though! The Louvre can never get boring. We had a concert in the Luxembourg Gardens there. It was nice.  After England and France, we traveled to Switzerland. Switzerland is absolutely beautiful. I really enjoyed Switzerland. We stayed in a small village there that was very nice. It was my favorite out of the seven countries we went to. We stayed in Villars. We traveled to Zermatt and Montreaux as well. Everything is beautiful in Switzerland.  Austria came next. Austria just reminded me of Switzerland, therefore it became monotonous. There wasn't really anything exciting about Austria. Had once concert in Austria and one in Switzerland.   We traveled to Germany, but on the way we stopped in Leichtenstein. That was really pointless. There's nothing to do there.   Rothenburg, Germany was my second favorite place. Its just lovely!  It all became pretty much the same though. We had chicken and potatoes every night, UGH! And too much water and walking. I lost some weight though, but its pretty much all back by today, Saturday, only 2 days later. Oh well. I'm not used to it being 6:44 pm, but I'm getting there!   I'm leaving for Canada on monday!&nbsp;I am SOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Going with Sarah for a week to her lakehouse. It is going to be so much fun. I am really excited. Thrilled. Ecstatic. We will have a really great time. I guess hard work really does pay off. Huh? Who would have thought?   Sunday In The Park With George is amazing. I am THRILLED that we are doing it. And Electra will just blow people's minds. As well as Sunday In The Park With George, but that's besides the point. We're sweeping Betty Buckley's this year you guys! OH YEAH!  Ordered my books today for school. For me and my brother John it cost 1,215.00 and something cents, don't remember. That's just crazy. Oh well. I'm not paying for it but I really do feel sorry for my parents! I guess they expect it. I'll promise to use them to pay off that! haha.  I had my hair cut today. I only got a trim but did something funky with my hair color. Do you guys know what red lights are? Well, they're BRIGHT RED highlights. Any way, we dyed my hair color THAT! It looked neon red. It was almost scary! for me, which means its really scary to the average person. After that, we put a dark brown on top and now it looks really neato! I don't have any pictures of it, I'm sorry.  I'm going to go take a nap and then hopefully Sarah can come over. She's worried about the storm, but GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I hope she comes! I miss her a LOT! I need to see her. We'll see.. Hope and Pray for me! I'm out. I might watch The Hours later. I've been wanting to see that.  *kisses* to Sarah!

      hey people, sarah posting. &nbsp; friday i drove down to austin to visit andrew at ut.&nbsp; his roommate is, well, if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all, i guess.&nbsp; he has the highest voice of any 18 yr old boy i've ever known.&nbsp; seriously, i think taylor's 5 yr old brother mark has a deeper voice.&nbsp; anyway, on friday we went to this pottery place where you pick out a piece and then paint it, then they glaze and fire it for you, then you pick it up later.&nbsp; andrew will have to bring me mine when he comes up to arlington.&nbsp; then we went to see anchorman.&nbsp; it was stupid but hilarious.&nbsp; a great mindless movie. &nbsp; saturday we got breakfast at some little restaurant, then went to this store called book woman.&nbsp; it's all lesbian books and stuff, and oh my god i wanted to buy everything in there.&nbsp; there was a little onsie for babies that said "my mommies rule" and "i was hatched by two chicks".&nbsp; then there was a shirt that said L.A.B.I.A. Lesbians Against Bush In America.&nbsp; and they had all this rainbow and pride stuff.&nbsp; i ended up spending $60 on two books and some stuff for me and some presents for taylor.&nbsp; i put it on the credit card, i hope my parents don't kill me.&nbsp; after that, we went to the cultural thing on campus that has the first photograph and other things.&nbsp; then we met alex and carlo at a bar to play shuffleboard.&nbsp; i was lazy so i just watched, but it looked like fun.&nbsp; when the waitress brought over another pitcher of beer, she asked if andrew and i wanted cups,&nbsp;without asking for id or anything.&nbsp; we declined and had water, but still, it was weird.&nbsp; that's never happened to me before. &nbsp; sunday we got brunch at einstein's bagels, then i drove home.&nbsp; god I-35 is so annoying, they're doing construction all the way down.&nbsp; at home, i was so tired, i fell asleep from 6 to 9, and i'm not a big napper. &nbsp; my throat's been hurting for the past few days, and today my mom freaked out and thought that i had strep, so she sent me to the doctor.&nbsp; i don't have strep, but it hurts like a&nbsp;bitch and i got some antibiotics.&nbsp; it might turn into mono, so i'm supposed to rest and drink fluids and all that crap.&nbsp; which blows.&nbsp; i hope i'm better before taylor gets back.&nbsp; on the other hand, it means that my parents don't expect me to do anything for a while and i get to spend the whole day on my computer and watching tv.&nbsp; wait, that's what i do anyway.... &nbsp; so that's what's been going on over here in my corner of the world.&nbsp; bye!

      hey everyone, sarah here.  so yesterday was interesting.  i got up and went swimming, then i decided to call catherine.  we had talked a few months back over IM, and she told me to call her, but i never did, even though i meant to.  so i waited till 3:30, when i knew she'd be out of bed (old habits die hard) and just called her out of the blue.  she sounded really surprised to hear from me, obviously, but happy too.  my parents were thrilled that i was talking to her, you know how parents are.    then i went over to her house and we spent the entire time just talking.  i swear my throat was sore as i was leaving.  we talked about absolutely everything, and it was great to catch up.  i'd missed her.  i told her to call me, and i hope we can keep in touch over the phone and email and stuff.  she's going to UW, which is only about a 90 min drive from northwestern, so who knows?  maybe i'll even see her sometime.   8 days till taylor comes home.  i hope she's having fun.

      hi everyone.  sarah here.  well, i'm back from my florida trek.  it was interesting, to say the least.  bailey was adorable and hilarious and all that, but towards the end of the trip she got cranky because she never got enough sleep.  she knows me now, and calls me "sar" cuz she hasn't quite gotten the two-syllable thing down.  she said "gam-ma" to my mom for grandma, but then she started calling her mike.  lol!  we don't know where it came from, but when you point to my mom and say "who's this?" she'll answer with mike.  we went to the beach twice, and i only got a little sun, so yay me.  the family reunion was not as bad as it could have been because i brought my computer and every once in a while i would become miss antisocial and go play on it.    I NEED TO GO SEE KING ARTHUR!  we left the day it came out and that's so horrible because i need to see keira knightley.  i'm actually going to see this movie alone if i have to.  other than that, i'm left with a whole lot of nothing to do.  if anybody wants to do anything, call me!  i promise i'll be free.  god i'm so pathetic.  i miss taylor.  *sigh*

      hey everybody, taylor's posting for the sarah/taylor blog.  Okay.. Well got up today at 8:30 and got ready to go take my AR test on The Crucible. I over analyzed three of them so I messed up but still managed to get a B, and that is just fine with me. I'm happy with that! Whatever! Its over, done with, no mas. hehe.   After that I went to my Doctor's appointment and it was good. You know.. as good as doctor's appointments can be! haha. 9:45 though, so early =)  My mom picked me up and took me to sarah's house where we hung out for about an hour and then SHE had to go to a Doctor's appointment. Doctor's appointment day, haha.   We saw Spiderman 2 after that. It was good. Was it as good as the first one? Maybe. It was just downright depressing most of the time. It made you want to just give up and walk out. I swear I think I have ADD because I want to keep switching the subject but I need to stay on Spiderman 2. Yeah, you should go see it, but it wasn't TOO great.  After Spiderman 2, Sarah and I went back to her house and hung out for 40 minutes until we had to go back to my house. Such a crazy day, I know. We only had 40 minutes to get me ready for my audition at 7. Wow that sounded selfish, but I took a shower, dried my hair, found my music, and everything in 40 minutes. I'd say it was pretty good! The audition went well. It was at Theater Arlington for The Music Man. Neato..  So we came back to my house after that, ordered pizza, played Scene It! with my brother, and talked to him for a while. He's such a cool guy. Sarah and I also watched Thirteen. Has anyone seen it? We both thought it was really good, but very very heavy. We were both just drained after we watched it. It was good though, I HIGHLY recommend that!   Well that's basically all for now. I'm sorry that its kind of short. I have to get up in 6 hours  bye Sarah!

      hey you guys, well taylor posting. it seems popular to post your schedule so here is mine.. it sucks... ass  1st: AP Lang and Comp 2nd: Study Hall 3rd: AP Calculus AB 4th: US History 5th: Honors Advanced Spanish 6th: Anatomy and Physiology 7th: Choir  I'm also going to take I.S. of acting with Mr. Newberry, but I don't know what we're going to count it for. Hopefully some honors credit. I need it on that stupid list. I'm sorry that I sound ocmplainy, I was just REALLY hoping for AP Chemistry, and it didn't happen. That just makes me mad and sad. I'm not feeling very good about things right now. I mean, my schedule next year is pretty easy. It'll be hard, but still. I need a challenge, and I'm afraid I made my schedule TOO easy. Whatever, it will still overload me. I just don't feel that I'm good enough at any ONE thing to make it in this world. I'm destined to become an average retail salesman or a cubicle working dopehead. I'm just so tense and jittery, its making me nauseous.  I hope everyone else feels better than I do. I want to become a better actress. I'm going to go look for classes RIGHT now online. After that I'm going to write the rest of my reader's log, and then maybe go to sleep. I'm sorry that this post can't be longer, i'll post tomorrow. Everyone have a good night. Sleep well  *kisses* to sarah. i don't deserve you, but i still have you. You're wonderful

      hey people, sarah here.  i haven't posted in a while, so here goes.  i've been doing my best to support taylor in her reading and such, and now she's done with catch-22 and almost done with her reader's log!!  i am so proud of her!  i'm seriously hoping that she'll be able to go with me to canada, because her parents are worried about her grades.  i totally believe in her, and i know she can finish the crucible tomorrow.  GO TAYLOR!!  uhh, so today i went to the doctor to get my tb test and meningitis vaccine for northwestern.  they didn't get my file, so hopefully they'll have it when i go back friday to read the test.  i have to fill out almost an entire medical history for school and i need my file for that.  that's pretty much all that's been going on in my life... exciting, huh?  god i'm so dull.  somebody please call me before i fall into a pattern of sloth.  oh wait, too late.  love you taylor!

      We're Back!! Who Missed Us? Everyone else is probably on vacation as well. This is Taylor posting for the us blog. School's almost back. I'm actually kind of excited. It might be fun. We shall see...  First of all and most important, I had a great time in Canada. Spending 7 days with Sarah, in CANADA, not in TEXAS, was absolutely perfect! It was just unreal. Amazing. Thank you Sarah for such a great time. I loved Bobcaygeon, your home, your boat, everything. Thank you. I don't like the heat here. Its way too damn hot in Texas right now. Oh well.  Sarah's leaving in a month and a half. It will be very sad yes, but I am so excited for her. We've promised each other we'd have an awesome time apart. I am excited to see her grow as an individual and she is very excited to see me grow as well.  I'm really tired and I might go take a nap in a few minutes. We shall see.  I'm running Spybot right now because something took over my computer while I was gone. Its so annoying. Oh! I'm getting a new computer. Very excited about it. As my birthday present. Woot.  I'll post more later =)
