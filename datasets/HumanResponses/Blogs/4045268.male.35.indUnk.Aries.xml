      So I did it! I gave my resignation at work and feel like a weight is off my shoulders. Martin Luther King Jr. is yelling between my ears, "free at last, free at last..." -- you get the picture I'm sure. Anyhow, my last day will be Aug. 25, 2004 which gives me a couple weeks before jetting off to get this next step in the adventure that is my life going. While I'm not sad or weird at all of quitting (I've always said the best part of any job is the day you say "I quit") doing something new is always strange. Strange but great. So there you go. Only a month more of night shifts. Yahooooo! I can't wait to end this job and get some version of life back (a word of advice to anyone who thinks working nights is good...dream on...it's good if you don't like living) Look out world, here I come!

      MARRIAGE  by Gregory Corso  Should I get married? Should I be good?  Astound the girl next door with my velvet suit and faustus hood?  Don't take her to movies but to cemeteries  tell all about werewolf bathtubs and forked clarinets  then desire her and kiss her and all the preliminaries  and she going just so far and I understanding why  not getting angry saying You must feel! It's beautiful to feel!  Instead take her in my arms lean against an old crooked tombstone  and woo her the entire night the constellations in the sky-   When she introduces me to her parents  back straightened, hair finally combed, strangled by a tie,  should I sit with my knees together on their 3rd degree sofa  and not ask Where's the bathroom?  How else to feel other than I am,  often thinking Flash Gordon soap-  O how terrible it must be for a young man  seated before a family and the family thinking  We never saw him before! He wants our Mary Lou!  After tea and homemade cookies they ask What do you do for a living?   Should I tell them? Would they like me then?  Say All right get married, we're losing a daughter  but we're gaining a son-  And should I then ask Where's the bathroom?   O God, and the wedding! All her family and her friends  and only a handful of mine all scroungy and bearded  just wait to get at the drinks and food-  And the priest! he looking at me as if I masturbated  asking me Do you take this woman for your lawful wedded wife?  And I trembling what to say say Pie Glue!  I kiss the bride all those corny men slapping me on the back  She's all yours, boy! Ha-ha-ha!  And in their eyes you could see some obscene honeymoon going on-  Then all that absurd rice and clanky cans and shoes  Niagara Falls! Hordes of us! Husbands! Wives! Flowers! Chocolates!  All streaming into cozy hotels  All going to do the same thing tonight  The indifferent clerk he knowing what was going to happen  The lobby zombies they knowing what  The whistling elevator man he knowing  Everybody knowing! I'd almost be inclined not to do anything!  Stay up all night! Stare that hotel clerk in the eye!  Screaming: I deny honeymoon! I deny honeymoon!  running rampant into those almost climactic suites  yelling Radio belly! Cat shovel!  O I'd live in Niagara forever! in a dark cave beneath the Falls  I'd sit there the Mad Honeymooner  devising ways to break marriages, a scourge of bigamy  a saint of divorce-   But I should get married I should be good  How nice it'd be to come home to her  and sit by the fireplace and she in the kitchen  aproned young and lovely wanting my baby  and so happy about me she burns the roast beef  and comes crying to me and I get up from my big papa chair  saying Christmas teeth! Radiant brains! Apple deaf!  God what a husband I'd make! Yes, I should get married!  So much to do! Like sneaking into Mr Jones' house late at night  and cover his golf clubs with 1920 Norwegian books  Like hanging a picture of Rimbaud on the lawnmower  like pasting Tannu Tuva postage stamps all over the picket fence  like when Mrs Kindhead comes to collect for the Community Chest  grab her and tell her There are unfavorable omens in the sky!  And when the mayor comes to get my vote tell him  When are you going to stop people killing whales!  And when the milkman comes leave him a note in the bottle  Penguin dust, bring me penguin dust, I want penguin dust-   Yes if I should get married and it's Connecticut and snow  and she gives birth to a child and I am sleepless, worn,  up for nights, head bowed against a quiet window, the past behind me,  finding myself in the most common of situations a trembling man  knowledged with responsibility not twig-smear nor Roman coin soup-  O what would that be like!  Surely I'd give it for a nipple a rubber Tacitus  For a rattle a bag of broken Bach records  Tack Della Francesca all over its crib  Sew the Greek alphabet on its bib  And build for its playpen a roofless Parthenon   No, I doubt I'd be that kind of father  Not rural not snow no quiet window  but hot smelly tight New York City  seven flights up, roaches and rats in the walls  a fat Reichian wife screeching over potatoes Get a job!  And five nose running brats in love with Batman  And the neighbors all toothless and dry haired  like those hag masses of the 18th century  all wanting to come in and watch TV  The landlord wants his rent  Grocery store Blue Cross Gas & Electric Knights of Columbus  impossible to lie back and dream Telephone snow, ghost parking-  No! I should not get married! I should never get married!  But-imagine if I were married to a beautiful sophisticated woman  tall and pale wearing an elegant black dress and long black gloves  holding a cigarette holder in one hand and a highball in the other  and we lived high up in a penthouse with a huge window  from which we could see all of New York and even farther on clearer days  No, can't imagine myself married to that pleasant prison dream-   O but what about love? I forget love  not that I am incapable of love  It's just that I see love as odd as wearing shoes-  I never wanted to marry a girl who was like my mother  And Ingrid Bergman was always impossible  And there's maybe a girl now but she's already married  And I don't like men and-  But there's got to be somebody!  Because what if I'm 60 years old and not married,  all alone in a furnished room with pee stains on my underwear  and everybody else is married! All the universe married but me!   Ah, yet well I know that were a woman possible as I am possible  then marriage would be possible-  Like SHE in her lonely alien gaud waiting her Egyptian lover  so i wait-bereft of 2,000 years and the bath of life.

      Been wandering around all day feeling like there is a cloud over my head â€” kind of like in that movie  Joe Versus the Volcano where the guy is told he has 'a cloud'. Don't know if I have 'a cloud' but I can feel for anyone who does today. Anyhow. Like good old Joe, my cloud will go away too. Maybe it has something to do with not wearing my new flame Airwalks. Maybe I need chocolate.  Most likely it is simply being at work (endless night shift life of the daily newspaper night editor) at 10 p.m., really hungry with nothing to eat at the same time that I'm looking down that long barrel to my trip home at 1 a.m. Chocolate or Nutella? Why do I do that to myself. Later (as my stomach grumbles...or was it my cloud?)

      written by Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski  Morpheus: I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice. Tumbling down the rabbit hole? Neo: You could say that. Morpheus: I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he's expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo? Neo: No. Morpheus: Why not? Neo: 'Cause I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. Morpheus: I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind -- driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about? Neo: The Matrix? Morpheus: Do you want to know what it is? (Neo nods his head.) Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, or when go to church or when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Neo: What truth? Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. (long pause, sighs) Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. (In his left hand, Morpheus shows a blue pill.) Morpheus: You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.  (a red pill is shown in his other hand)  You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.  (Long pause; Neo begins to reach for the red pill)  Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more. (Neo takes the red pill and swallows it with a glass of water)

      I've somehow managed to avoid becoming part of this whole 'blogging' craze this long but as a writer finally couldn't stop myself from giving in to the temptation...what are ya gonna do? So here I am, banging out a few lines of my first posting to my blog. Here are a few things I noticed today: - The name for the next Star Wars movie is going to be The Revenge of the Sith...and we all know it'll be a nasty flick that everyone will hate since all the good guys (except Yoda and Obiwan) get killed. - My new (and awesome) flame Airwalks either get the response, "...whoa, those are the coolest shoes..." or "...clown shoes..." Either way I love them. - The one constant in the universe is that three little kids will make as much noise and mess as possible. - I've got a brutal addiction to Nutella (I'll eat it on anything, including a spoon and the jar alone...so kind of Nutella 'on' air or Nutella 'on' my tongue ...you know, instead of 'on' bread). - My monkey mind (the one that is always jumping around between these ears) would prefer me to shout out anyone it deems an 'idiot' instead of being a good Buddhist and just walking on past and seeing that the 'idiot' is a good tool for training. Now that I write this the same monkey mind is saying that I used the right word in describing them as 'tools' and points out that 'tools' who pull forward into the street when you are trying to cross (you're on foot and they are in their BMWs) and they have a stop sign should really learn to follow the rules of the road. That's about it...well there's probably more but that will do for now. See, this blogging stuff isn't so bad. Later

      I was just reading about Arthur Rimbaud. He was really something else.  The guy wrote just amazing stuff. And what is so incredible is the fact he banged out all the writings we have from him before he was 21 -- and then threw in the towel, joining the military and running off to adventures and death. I know most people don't want to think of writers -- especially ones they like -- throwing in the towel but as a writer I have to say I can respect the decision. Writing is a fire that burns you from inside.  Some write for money (or die trying), some write for love (or the need for some) and others write because they have no choice. For a writer, writing is living. For Rimbaud -- who pretty much changed poetry forever -- to turn his back on all of it really blows me away. He saw it all as garbage, and the fame that was spreading for him back in France was a joke. A bad joke. Well, he was a great writer but ended up losing a leg due to complications of syphilis and died at 37. I don't know what any of this has to do with the price of cheese but it seems interesting at this moment in time. As for me, I don't know that I'd ever be able to give up writing, I enjoy the heat the fire gives off too damn much. But as for the rest, running off to join the military, seeing the world -- I'm all over that. His need to give the finger to some twisted notions of fame and literary 'greatness'...didn't do Kerouac or Rimbaud much good. The world does what it does no matter what you wish it would do. Kerouac died with sixty bucks and some change in the bank and Rimbaud was killed by the flu with syphilis raging through his body. Both are still seen by many as literary superstars. What's it all worth? Peanuts probably in the great Buddha Universe but then again, that's why we write about it all.

      There is no skimboarding in Ontario. I know because I've tried and tried to find just one place to do it and though there might be some messed up people who say there is, "hey, I know I guy who does that...blah, blah, blah" don't believe any of them. Most beaches are just way too angled with not enough flat sand to skim. Wasaga was close but it sucked...at least for skimboarding. Next spring and summer when I'm back in B.C. I'm planning on making up for all the lost skimboarding time. The other thing is that I'd really like to get my eldest son into skimboarding. He skateboards a bit and I think he'd end up as addicted as I am. I know one thing for sure -- as long as I'm able to hop a board and skim I won't be living anywhere that keeps me away from doing it ever again. A bad day of skimboarding is still better than most days of doing almost anything else.

      Why is it that people panning for money always ask you if you have any "spare change"? I don't get it. I mean, is there anyone in the world who actually has "spare change"...money you don't need? Maybe Bill Gates and a few others but I doubt the people wandering past most of these folks have anything close to spare change. And don't get me started on the people who ask for "spare change" when I'm walking by with my three kids. If anyone needs spare change and should be looking for handouts its me. And yeah, on more than one occasion I've said, "hey man, I've got three kids, I need all the change I've got." Usually I get blank, confused looks back. This doesn't mean I don't believe in helping out those in need. When I lived in West Vancouver I'd give the kids who begged for money on the corner some food when I was on my way back from the grocery store and I've been known to help out other people who look like they could genuinely use a hand up in the world. But "spare change"? This kid in clothes worth more than the ones on my back wandered up to me yesterday when I was wandering around downtown and said, "Hey man, do you have an extra quarter or something that I could have."  I looked at him, looked at his clean, new clothes, the shoes worth more than my bike and said, "no, do you?" Yeah, I'm heartless. So much for the compassionate Buddhist. I believe in giving when it is deserved, not giving when it would make me an idiot to do it. Some 16, 17, 18 year old guy does not need me giving him money. He needs to go down to McDonald's or the local recruiting centre and fill out the forms. Or better yet, go back to school. But I have to admit that I give high marks for creativity. Once I saw this punk with a good three or four foot tall green mohawk sitting on the sidewalk near MuchMusic in Toronto with a sign that read, "Need money for pot". I gave him two bucks. Hell, everyone walking past was, and most of us were thinking that we wished we'd thought of the idea first. Anyhow, that's my rant for today.

      The baby boomers had their killing of JFK and Vietnam, the generation before had the Second World War and it seems that the common thread that will hold my generation together is going to be living through George W. Bush trying to destroy the world and the terrorism that came as a result. Sometimes I wonder if Bush and terrorism aren't just one and the same...some sort of symbiotic relationship. But I try not to think of this much. Now it's election time in the U.S. and surprise, there is a major terrorist alert in New York and Washington. Seems somewhat ironic to me. Actually, it doesn't seem ironic, it's downright suspicious. Truth is that Bush probably needs one or two good terrorist attacks so that he can look the part of the hero to have any chance at being re-elected. That isn't to say that I don't believe for a second that this world isn't sick and in serious need for help of some sort -- I mean with a pseudo holy war going on in the middle east thanks to Bush and some messed up militant types who want to kill in the name of Allah -- but terror threats coming when Bush needs them smells fishy to me. Personally, I'd be far more concerned with going to the Olympics this summer. Oh, wait, that isn't in the U.S. Like I said, fishy. If nothing else, if we live through these times, we'll all end up cynics in our old age, rattling on about wars for oil, terror threats that never amounted to much and the one attack that did. Sad times. Guess it is like that Chinese curse, "may you live in interesting times."
