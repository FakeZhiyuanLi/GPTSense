      New layout! It only took me....three straight hours to code it and all. I haven't designed stuff in so long I forgot everything, and simple codes just left me...Anyways, the minor changes will be made...later today. After graduation practice, and work, and all that other stuff...night!

      I guess I'm back on Blogger, since I finally got it working. I like Blogger better than Xanga because it's more customizable. Anyways, this is just a test post, so more later....

      Two days and I'll have been working at McDonald's for one year. Not too bad for&nbsp;my first job. Three more weeks until college which I'm still trying to pay for. SOS comes back in a week, and I'm very glad because I've been waiting months for SOS to return =) Great stuff. That's all for now, nothing special, I know.

      I'm doing something with water with Jennifer next Thursday yay! I forgot what she said it was but it sounded lovely. And...next Friday I register for classes at USC- Upstate . I really don't want to go to college. I would like so much more to just travel and learn everything I need to know by travelling, not by what some professor tells me. I want to find stuff out for my own self and have many different views on one subject, not just the view of an "accredited" person. This sucks. Oh well, maybe it won't be so bad.

      I just got done washing my car and running from godzilla bees. I think they get bigger every year, and they're blue this year for some reason...I cleaned out my glovebox for the first time since I've owned this car. I am now aware of my extra seatbelt clicky things that I have, just in case I should ever need them, I now know where they are. How delightful...Now I'm chuggin milk and oatmeal cookies. I've had big cravings for oatmeal cookies lately. You know, I'm beginning to think I'm just talking to myself...oh well!   Edit ---> Why aren't you people outside on such a beautiful day!!

      Alright, two posts in five minutes, how extremely gay. Not like you care, because your the exact opposite of you, you're the absence of person! HA! So, I leave you with some lyrics, because I can I will.   "Psychotic, hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic, ain't nobody hotter and so on and yadda yadda, gotta talk a lotta hem de lay la la la, oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta keep movin..."      So old. So short. My hair is so short. I look like an Egypitan. _/-. That was Egyptian.
