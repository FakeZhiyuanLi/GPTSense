       It's that time of year again.  The sun is shining, the temperature is high, and the mosquitoes (the state bird of Minnesota) are out.  The kids are out of school for the summer, and while road traffic is lighter and my morning commute faster, our street is filled from sun-up to sun-down with neighborhood children of all shapes and sizes. The front lawn is littered with bicycles and skateboards, and there are a half-dozen boys in my son's room playing "Grand Theft Auto" on his PS2.  Big Bunny, a rabbit the size of a cocker spaniel, is eating the flowers my wife planted, and  the woodpile for the backyard firepit is growing.  The Cubs started strong, but are slipping in the National League Central standings. On the other hand, the Schaumburg Flyers are in first place in the Northern League, and as of today have won nineteen of their first twenty-seven games.  Yes, my birthday is fast approaching. Happy Birthday to me.  Next weekend I will be forty-one years old, yet I am worse than a kid when it comes to birthdays and Christmas. As much as I like surprises, I can't wait to see what my wife and kids have picked out for me. On the other hand, I'm just as bad when I'm the gift-giver. Last month I presented my wife with her birthday gift a week in advance because I couldn't contain the surprise any longer. Not that she minded, of course. She's just like me.  She prepares for my day running secret errands. If I ask her where she's going, she grins and says, "Just shopping." When she returns from her trips to who-knows-where, I am banished to my room in the basement while she and the kids haul in (and hide) whatever she has purchased that day.  Three weeks ago she called me in the middle of the day and said, "I just ordered one of your birthday presents."   It had begun! I managed to contain my excitement and curiosity when I nonchalantly asked, "What did you get me?"  "I can't tell you."  "Is it bigger than a breadbox?"  "Let's just say that it's something you can't touch. But I'll be there."   What in the hell was she talking about? Something I couldn't touch, but she'd be there?  That  definitely  left out a romantic weekend getaway.  That night we were on our way to the movie theater when she said, "I know what you're getting for your birthday." I nearly ran her brand-new Santa Fe into a ditch.  "What is it?" I asked, knowing full well that she wouldn't tell. I had to ask anyway. It wouldn't be any fun if I didn't play along.  "I can't tell," she teased. "It's a surprise."  "Give me a hint."  She pondered for a moment, and then said, "It begins with a 'B'."  That was helpful. Naturally my guess was of an adult nature. It began with a 'B', all right, and is something every man wants. She laughed until she cried.  "I'll give you a better hint," she said.   Oh, good.    "It begins with a 'B', but it can also begin with a 'T'."   "Baseball tickets!"   I shouted, and to other drivers I must have appeared to have been having a stroke. I am a Chicago Cubs fan now living in an American League town; and since the Cubs never make it up here, I have been dying to see my favorite minor-league team, the Schaumburg Flyers, when they venture north to play the St. Paul Saints.  My wife was happy that I was excited about the gift and said, "I got tickets for us and the kids to see the Saints on July 10th. I know that it's two weeks after your birthday, but I wanted to go when your team will be in town."  "We're going to see the Flyers, we're going to see the Flyers," I sang, and I can just imagine how ridiculous I looked.  Today my wife ran several secret birthday errands after work and, after making a stop at home to drop off whatever surprises she has in store, took our son with her do to more secret birthday deeds. She won't tell me a damn thing. She did make our son change into nice clothing before they took off, which piques my curiosity all the more.  They left hours ago, and I am home alone with the dog, the cats, and an insane birthday jones.  I don't dare snoop. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but my wife would murder me.

       My wife said something last night that couldn't be more true: "When pheromones are in the air, the kids have to go downstairs to investigate."   As a result, it's becoming increasingly difficult for us to spend any quality adult time together without worry of teenage interruption.  When our modest split-entry ranch home was built twenty-one years ago, it had originally contained only two bedrooms, both on the main level; but necessity being the mother of more than invention, two more rooms were installed in the basement.  Years later, when I moved into my wife's home, she was the occupant of the larger of the two basement rooms, and the kids slept upstairs. They naturally bemoaned this decision, as they thought it would be cool for them to live in the basement. But my wife, being the wise woman she is, nixed their proposal for one simple reason: creaky floorboards.   Most homeowners would immediately locate the source of the squeak and silence it; but we're not most people. We can hear when the kids get out of bed to visit the bathroom or get something to drink. We know when one child is visiting a sibling across the hall to play a video game or watch a movie, or going into the living room to watch TV or play on the computer. And the floor tells us when someone is coming downstairs.  At this point my wife and I scramble to opposite sides of the king-size bed, pull the covers over our naked forms and yell, "Who's moving around up there?"  This is sometimes met with absolute silence. A moment later the sleepless child will steal back into his or her own room without owning up to their midnight errand. Too often, however, the footsteps will continue down into the basement and into our room.  The excuses for interruption are legendary:   "My lunch account at school is empty."     "I need five dollars for bowling."    "The dog has a tick."    "Would you mind if I did my laundry? I have nothing to wear."    The laundry room is, of course, in the basement... next to our bedroom.  Our two daughters share the room above ours, and one evening we came home from work to find that one daughter had moved her belongings into an open area of the basement because she had had a fight with her sister and needed her own space. This revelation sat with us as well as airline food. We ultimately laid down the law and told the kids that, once Mom and Dad go to bed, the basement is off-limits to them. They all nodded their heads and chorused "Okay", but that agreement was broken before the sun rose the next day.  We are considering installing electric-shock pads on the stairs to deter wandering minorities.   As most parents of teenagers can attest, there is a definite formula relating the parents' love life to the kids' age. The older the kids get, the less the parents get. Two years ago we were shocked into abstinence when one daughter bluntly stated that she could hear us at night. She capped this declaration with a resounding "Ewwww."  When we were able to try again, I was instructed by my wife, in no uncertain terms, to be quiet. For those of you who have never attempted this, let me tell you now: it's not easy. Nor is it pretty.  Not that anyone in the stage of completion looks their absolute best. But when your body is exploding, your mouth opens by itself and all auditory evidence escapes. Having to be quiet is like plugging a cannon and then setting it off. When a human is stifled at the moment of detonation, teeth are clenched. Lips are bitten. Every vein in the neck pops out, and the face turns a distinct shade of purple. Sometimes my wife will help by shoving the heel of her hand into my mouth.   We take great joy in those rare pockets of time when all three kids are out of the house. After sitting in the living room for five minutes to make sure that the kids are really gone, we will run downstairs and throw ourselves into bed.  One minute and thirteen seconds later the front door will open, and all hope is lost. Someone's plans fell through, or they decided to invite their friends over to our house to hang out.   My wife kisses me and apologizes, promising that we'll try again later. She gets dressed and goes upstairs.   I cover my face with a pillow and scream.

       I think Eliot only loves me for treats.  Eliot is my youngest cat. My wife surprised me on Christmas Eve with a fourteen-week-old tiger kitten. He is sweet and playful and the best present I've ever received. When he was a baby he would lay on my chest and press his face against my chin, purring loudly. At night I like to lay on my back and read for a while, so Eliot would curl up to sleep between my legs (a/k/a "the nest").  Now he is about nine months old, and behaves very much the way a toddler boy does. He creates havoc, comes to you only if there's something in it for him, and generally leaves terror in his wake. Think of him as a very cute, seven-pound, furry gray Godzilla.  Eliot is the youngest of four cats in our household. I had adopted Milo and Gilda a few years ago, and my wife already had Callie. Eliot made four when she decided that we needed to "have a baby together."  Before Eliot came into our lives, Gilda was the only cat in the family who liked treats. Unfortunately, they can only be one variety: Pounce, in the "Tempting Tuna" flavor. A couple of years ago the store we shopped at stopped carrying Gilda's favorite treat and, being sneaky, I bought a different brand and slipped them into the hot-pink Pounce canister.  Gilda was not fooled, nor was she amused. In fact, she wouldn't come near me until I had the real McCoy.  So when Eliot joined our family, I naturally wondered if he was a treatmonger like his sister. He happened to be in the room when I was giving Gilda a treat one evening and he wanted in on the action.  To say that Gilda was nonplussed at the prospect of having to share her precious treats with this  interloper  would be an understatement. She was just plain pissed off, and smacked Eliot upside the head. He stood his ground, though, and wouldn't leave until he had his treat.   Now he only comes around at treat time, which is my bedtime, and we have a little routine: I get into bed and grab the treat canister from the ledge. Gilda is usually already there and sitting patiently (yes, I have trained my cats to sit for treats).   Unless Eliot tripped me going downstairs to the bedroom, I have to summon him. This is achieved by shaking the treat can three times. If Eliot is already downstairs, he magically appears at the foot of the bed in a sitting position. If he has been upstairs, I will hear the sound of forty-seven wildebeest running through the house and down the stairs, followed by a small cat magically appearing at the foot of the bed in a sitting position.   The rule is that the first cat sitting is the first cat served. Nine times out of ten it’s Gilda, and she never fails to give Eliot a smug “I-get-the-first-treat” look. So Gilda gets one, and then Eliot, and they alternate until they have each been served three treats.   In addition to knowing to sit, my cats also know how to count because after the third treat Gilda always gives me a pitiful look, as if to say, “You love me more, so you’ll give me another, right?” When she doesn’t get it, she still curls up next to me and purrs in my ear.  Eliot, on the other hand, licks his chops and hops off the bed. He got what he wanted.  I feel so used.

       The other day I was sitting in the bathroom, talking to my wife while she showered.  "If you had to give up one of your senses," I asked, "but got to choose which one, which would it be?"  She was silent for a moment, and then I realized that she was brushing her teeth. I waited patiently for her to spit.  She pulled the shower curtain aside and looked me in the eye. "What kind of question is that?" she asked. "How can I possibly choose?"  You have to understand that this is how my mind works. I will often interject the most bizarre observations and queries into unrelated conversations and comfortable silences. My wife has gotten used to this, bless her heart. I know that I take some getting used to, but I never fail to amuse.  "Just choose," I said. "Which one would you give up?"  She closed the shower curtain and I listened to her thinking. Naturally, as I tend to do when waiting patiently for something, I played the  Jeopardy!  theme in my head.  "Smell," she finally said.  "Excuse me?" Did she want me to smell something?  "I'd give up my sense of smell," she replied. "I don't  need  to smell anything."  "If you couldn't smell anything, your sense of taste would be severly impacted." Of course I knew this to be true. I watch The Discovery Channel.  "Even better! What a great diet!"   I stood and peered around the corner of the shower curtain. I did this not so much as to make eye contact, but because I truly love looking at my wife. She calls this "stalking", which is untrue because I sleep next to her. Stalkers don't sleep next to the stalked.  "If you couldn't taste anything, you would miss my cooking." I knew this would get her. She loves my cooking. From my ravioli with sweet Italian sausages and roasted peppers to my deep-dish chicken pie, she was hooked.  I won’t even start on my desserts.   Anyway, I was right: the prospect of voluntarily giving up my cooking wasn’t appealing at all.  “Well,” she said, “I  can’t  go without seeing, and I  can’t  stand the thought of never hearing the kids’ voices again, or listening to music.”  I sighed.  “What else is there?” she asked.  “Touch,” I replied loudly. I couldn’t imagine kissing her without actually feeling her lips against mine, or holding her without feeling how soft her skin is.  “Forget that.” I think she was reading my mind, and smiled to myself.  She was quiet again, and then said, “What sense would you give up?”  “Hearing,” I said, perhaps a bit too quickly.  She turned the water off and pulled the curtain open. “No, you wouldn’t.”  I laughed. “Oh, yes I would.”  “But you’d never hear my voice again.” She began toweling off.  “I’d remember your voice and play it back in my head.”  “What about sight?”  “I’m too visual. I wouldn’t last a day. Besides, I couldn’t  not  look into your eyes every day.”  That, by the way, was  not  a line. She really does have beautiful eyes.  “And I couldn’t give up burying my face in your neck and smelling you,” I added.   She was standing at the sink now, looking at me in the mirror’s reflection. “So why hearing?”  Out in the living room the kids were fighting already. “I wouldn’t have to listen to  that ,” I laughed, and bit my tongue.  She wasn’t amused.  So maybe I’ve already lost a sense & never realized it.  I simply don’t have the sense to keep my mouth shut sometimes.

        I hate pickles.    I do. It's not even so much as a "strong dislike". I actually  hate  pickles, to the point that I have become pickle-repellent. If I sense a piece of pickle in something I am eating, my body will react. First, my mouth opens as wide as humanly possible in an attempt to prevent the pickle particle from continuing to touch the inside of my body. Then my body actually rids itself of the uninvited condiment by expelling it at Mach II.   So whenever I get a burger from Burger King or McDonald's, I specify "no pickles" to the person in the ridiculous hat who cares  so much  about my gastronomic happiness. I realize that I'm creating more work for them, but I  am  the customer. The order taker has to press an additional button that will print  "w/o pickle"  on the ticket. The person who actually  makes  the burger has to be sure to read that instruction, and follow through.  My wife, by way of contrast,  loves  pickles, and would be happy if I just picked them off and gave them to her, but I don't like the idea of a pickle having ever touched my food. Besides, have you  seen  how many pickles Burger King puts on their sandwiches? When I was a kid I called them "pickle-burgers" because there were never fewer than five on there.  Now, there once was a time, before McDonald's jumped on the customized burger track, when I didn't have a choice. I had to pick the damn things off and dispose of them. Occasionally I would be alone in my car, doing forty-five down a busy thoroughfare; and having no co-pilot to help with pickle extraction and disposal, I would have to perform these operations myself. Naturally, weather permitting, the fastest and easiest route was out my open car window, into the slipstream and who knows where from there.  Sometimes the pickles, after flopping through the air like flaccid green Frisbees, would hit the windshield of the car in the left lane. If  I  was in the left lane, I might get lucky and get one inside a passing vehicle.   In the summer of '87 I was driving my 1975 Chevrolet Caprice Classic north on  Ashland Avenue in Chicago, happily flipping pickles out my window, when one of those little green bullets sailed into the open side of a Chicago Sun-Times delivery truck and landed on the driver's arm.  I was amazed! I had never successfully made full pickle contact with another person (I know, that sounds sick, doesn't it?). I therefore began viewing the pickle-fling as a sport, and devised the following points system:   TARGET ............... POINTS   Vehicle exterior    not windshield) ...... 1 Vehicle windshield ...... 3 Vehicle interior ........ 5 Person in vehicle ....... 10 Pedestrian .............. 15 Police car exterior ...(not windshield) ..... 50 Police car windshield ... 75 Police car interior ..... 100  Keep in mind, however, that if you hit any part of a patrol car and the officer  does  notice, you immediately forfeit all accumulated points and your driving privileges.

       Why do birds wait until a car is approaching to cross the street? Is it some sort of avian hazing ritual? Some twist on the old game of "chicken"?  No wonder birds don't live long. The parents are probably driven to an early grave by the younger birds' antics.   This behavior in humans would be socially unacceptable, yet would yield the medical and legal professions handsome rewards. If my kids stood on the side of the road and didn't cross until an oncoming vehicle was five feet away, I would lock them in their rooms until they were of legal age and able to provide their own health insurance.   The interim, of course, would be chock-full of psychiatric evaluation.  Which makes me wonder about all of the other things kids do...  We have a very large trampoline in our back yard, and it is a constant source of amusement for our children and their friends. If I want to find my 15-year-old son and he is not sequestered in his room talking on the phone with his girlfriend while simultaneously playing a video game, I need only look out the kitchen window to find him bouncing up and down.   He and his sisters have (unwisely, in my opinion) invented any number of games to play on the trampoline. Their favorite is "Butt Wars". Two players begin bouncing on the trampoline and performing as many seat drops as possible before their rubber legs intervene. The player who performs the most seat drops wins. Naturally, this game is made amusing by the fact that the other player's bouncing prevents you from landing squarely on your feet between drops. Naturally, the kids have on more than one occasion come close to bouncing right off the edge.  Another game they play is for one daughter to curl up in a fetal position in the center of the trampoline while her brother bounces in circles around her. She, of course, is tossed up and down and laughs uncontrollably while her brother, who is 6'1" and weighs more than 200 pounds, brings his size 14 1/2 feet within inches of her head.  When our kids' friends come over to play on the trampoline, I quiz them: do they have health insurance? Will their parents sue me if they fall off and break their collarbone?  Who thought that a simple purchase would have led to more gray hairs?  I will admit that I was not immune to questionable behavior as a child. As a matter of fact, the emergency room staff was on a first-name basis with my mother.  At age four I found a dead squirrel in the back yard and decided to perform a necropsy on the stiffened rodent using a Popsicle stick which I had sharpened on the sidewalk. My mother caught me before I made the Y-incision and dragged me back into the house where I was kept for the remainder of the day. I could not help the fact that I was interested in science at such a young age, and am clearly not at fault for my curiosity.  At age five my older brother and I ran a home-made zip line from a second-story window to the fence at the end of our property line. The reason for this was that, in addition to the fun of emulating G.I. Joe, it was a much faster way to go outside to play.  There were no injuries but my mother woke the next day with two new wrinkles and forty-seven gray hairs. This I blame on my brother, who was eleven years old and therefore much more responsible than I.  Also at age five my six-year-old sister and I put a twist on the centuries-old field event of hammer-toss. I would grasp her by the ankles and swing her around, lifting her off the ground as her hair flew out behind her. I would then let go and see how far she flew. No serious injuries were ever sustained, but then we were blissfully unaware of Blue Cross co-pays. Our inspiration stemmed from watching the hammer-throw in the Summer Olympics, so clearly we were not to blame for our behavior.  At age six, I knelt on the bathroom sink in order to see myself in the mirror. Not wanting to jump down onto the cold, hard tile, I grasped the edge of the ancient medicine cabinet and slid down. What I didn't realize was that the back edge was razor-sharp, and I sliced two fingers open to the bone. This was the fault of whomever had taken my step-stool from the bathroom.  At age ten I fell twelve feet, face-first from a swing set crossbar into the pea gravel below. As I lay under the bright lights in the emergency room while a doctor plucked dozens of tiny rocks from my flesh, I blamed the park district for not providing me a softer landing.   So what price fun? When do we become responsible for ourselves? At what age do we realize that what seems harmless will result in a visit to the emergency room, a seventy-five-dollar co-pay and sleepless nights for our parents?  As I count my own gray hairs, I offer to my long-suffering mother an apology from the bottom of my heart. I probably caused her more strife and gray hairs than most kids, and she gets the ultimate payback: my recklessness has come back to haunt me in the form of 3 teenagers on a back yard trampoline.

       I had a brief but satisfying encounter yesterday in the parking lot of Costco, the warehouse club to which my wife and I belong. And get your minds out of the gutter; it wasn't   that   kind of encounter.  All I wanted was laundry soap and some Benadryl (naturally I went beyond my short list, but that's another story for another time), and was not counting on an exchange with a guy in a dirty red pick-up truck who felt he had to make his feelings known about my politics.  But then, as I wear my heart on my sleeve and my politics on my bumper, I am prepared for a battle of wits at any time.  "You shouldn't be disrespecting the President like that," Red Pick-up said as I was loading my purchases into my vehicle. He was referring to one of my bumper stickers which suggested in no uncertain terms that Bush be sent packing back to Texas.  "Do you have a job?" I asked, not bothering to pause as I arranged my purchases in the hatch.  "Nope," Red Pick-up admitted.  "How long have you been unemployed?" I queried.  "Over a year," he admitted.  "Having a hard time finding a job, huh?" I emptied the cart and closed the hatch on my Democratic blue PT Cruiser.  "Yeah," he said, and stared at my bumper stickers.  "Thank your President," I said. "He probably sent your job overseas."  No response. No surprise.  It was a quickie, but it was almost as satisfying as   that   kind of encounter.

       I am a Democrat.  I am a husband, a father, a son and a friend.  I am an American. I am a Democrat.  It is as much a part of me as my blood type and the color of my eyes. It is in my heart and my head and my soul.  Upon my impatient arrival in an elevator forty-one years ago, my statistics were recorded on my birth certificate alongside my name and that of my parents; and while I have changed physically, I was born a Democrat and my faith in my party and its ideals will never waiver.  Recently, out of curiosity, I checked out the Republican Party's website just to compare it to the Democratic Party's. What I found was not a mature discourse on platforms and policies, but a slamfest filled with barbs and jibes at Senator Kerry and all Democrats.  How very disappointing.  "GOP" is supposed to stand for "Grand Old Party", yet I saw nothing grand on their website. There is little, if any, information to be found on where the GOP stands. I am hard-pressed to locate real issues, serious platform data or any mature dialogue on the sorry state of affairs in which Mr. Bush has placed this once-great nation.  Conversely, what we are subjected to when going to  urlLink gop.org  is a vicious assault so sophomoric that it may well have been composed by a group of sixth-graders. Their reference to the Democratic Convention as the "Cosmetic Convention" was especially charming. Was this the idea of GOP chairman Ed Gillespie? Is he proud of his party's name-calling tactics?  The Republican Party has spent the Bush administration laying blame for this country's problems squarely in the laps of anyone but George W. Bush.  Our economy has suffered greatly in the past 3 1/2 years; yet when called to task, Mr. Bush blamed the prosperity of the Clinton administration.   When asked why more than one million Americans lost their jobs during the current administration, the White House attempted to distract us with an unnecessary war, thus making the United States the pariah of the free world.  We questioned Bush on the war, and were thrown the "weapons of mass destruction" bone.  After chewing the bone and finding no marrow, Mr. Bush's sleight-of-hand conveniently pointed us in the direction of that crafty Saddam Hussein, who obviously had his WMDs miniaturized and hidden somewhere in his spider-hole. Just add water, and  presto ! Instant WMD. Too bad this occured in the middle of the desert. Now that the vast majority of Americans are fed up with Mr. Bush keeping our troops in Iraq for no good reason, he has again pulled a quick-change and hoisted Senator Kerry (a real war hero who spent his active duty on the front lines, and not playing cards in Alabama) as his shield. Hundreds of American troops have been killed in Iraq in the past seventeen months, but that apparently doesn't matter because the RNC has another dirty, immature campaign ad to mount. Why bother with the real issues when you can fill the airwaves with lies?  I may be an American by birth and by choice, but Mr. Bush is  not  my President; and I will do everything in my power to remove him from an office he neither earned nor deserves.      SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. PLANT BUSH BACK IN TEXAS!
