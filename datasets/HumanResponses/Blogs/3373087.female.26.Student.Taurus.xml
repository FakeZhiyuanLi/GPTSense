      I'm starting to feel the pains of Brandon-withdrawl now and he's only been gone for 5 hours.  The next 7 weeks are going to be rough.  Acutally, I think the hardest time will be the next 2 weeks or so since we need to readjust to not seeing eachother again. The thought of spending 7 weeks in Boston will be one of the few things that will keep me going. As B put it, this was the best Memorial Day weekend of my entire life. I wouldn't change anything about the time we spent together, but such a wonderful weekend necessarily makes this temporary separation even harder.    All of the apprehension that I felt just prior to his arrival immediately went away when I picked him up at the airport. Spending time with him is so  easy .  All weekend I scarcely felt like I was with a different person.  I know this sounds strange, but it was almost like our thoughts were so similar that it was like talking to ME.  I just feel like we understand eachother in a fundamental way, even though our expereinces are different.  There were many occasions when he would say something that sounded exactly like something that I would say.    We had some really good conversations about our future, the conflicts we've had, our differences, about people, about our spiritual growth and discipline, and much more.  I think my most vivid memories will be of the times that we spent sitting by the pond in the gazebo.

      I'm going to pick up B at the airport in about 4 hours.  For some reason, I feel uneasy about this weekend.  Maybe it's because we've been anticipating this for so long (7 weeks).  But still, we've had some difficult discussions for the past two days about my high expectations and how it makes him feel inadequate.  I knew this was a problem of mine, because Jerry frequently complained about this too.  Not that I think that B's complaining because this is a valid concern.  I would feel like crap if my b/f made me feel like I wasn't good enough too.    I woke up feeling terrible and have had this awful feeling inside me for the whole day. I've just been thinking about why B likes me and why I like him.  It's pretty fundamental, really.  We do have fun together. I've just been really irritable lately and I can't figure out if it's because of B or if it's just my moodiness.  I really can't tell.  I really hope this weekend goes well.  If B and I don't work out, this summer is going to be excruciating. But to stay together just to make this ummer more bareable would be totally artificial.  I don't think we've been together long enough to give our relationship a fair chance--or have we?  Last night B pointed out that we've been talking for nearly 6 months now.  That is NOT a short amount of time when you think about it.   I just don't know what to do or why I'm even thinking this way.  I keep thinking about that list I made over the summer and if B fits that picture.  He fits it pretty well actually (or else I wouldn't be dating him), but he doesn't totally fit the idealized picture inside my head, which is different.  The list consists of my "non-negotiables"--things that the guy must have before I would even consider dating him.  My mental picture is my IDEAL b/f--of course he has all my non-negotiables, but also lots of other bonuses. I don't know if a guy like that actually exists.  I shouldn't think that there is, because if there isn't and I keep trying to find him, I'm going to be single forever. The problem is, B is upset that I keep trying to make him to look like my ideal guy and those expectations are impossibly high.  No, I should definately not try to change him because that's just not going to happen.  Since B knows that he isn't ideal for me, he thinks I'm settling.  But NO ONE IS IDEAL so I'm not really settling if the ideal man doesn't exist.  I'm just trying to be REALISTIC with what kind of choices are out there, so I'm not settling for second best.    This situation is definatly better than any I've been in previously and I feel like I'm on the verge of screwing up something great.  He's been wonderfully patient with me, although I know that this is frustrating for him too.  I need to relax about this relationship and not feel the need to figure out of B is the one for me.  We've only been together for barely 3 months now--I just need to enjoy this relationship and leave the worrying up to God.  If B is the one for me, then God will grow us together in time.

       **1 Corinthians 10:12-13--"So, if you think that you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!  No temptation has seized you except what is common to man.  And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.  But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."   Paul reminds us of our forefathers, who acutally saw God firsthand.  They passed under his cloud as they sojourned out of Egypt and passed through the sea that was parted for them.  I can't help but think that if God was that obvious to me, then I would never doubt Him and fall into temptation!  How could they be unfaithful to God and worship idols they had made even after God had sent them manna and quail from heaven?  It seems incredible to me that the Isrealites would be so forgetful.  Then I look at my life and see how forgetful I have been even though God has made Himself equally obvious (although not in the same ways).  I remember when I was living in Alameda and I was reading the Bible at Starbucks after work.  I knew that I should do my QT, but I was so tired and unmotivated from the long day.  I prayed that God would change my attitude.  Not even an hour later as I was doing my QT, a guy comes up to me and asks me if I was reading the Bible.  I said "yes" and my testimony just spilled out of me.  I remember talking to him for a long time about how I had gone to church all my life and yet never really knew God.  I told him how I was rejected from vet school faithful God had been to me in what seemed like a time of devestation.  I told him how God used that circumstance to break me of my pride and lead me to salvation.  I remember being fille with such joy and gratitude that God would use me even when I initially didn't even feel like doing my QT that day.  God totally rewards faithfulness!    But just like the Israelites, I quickly forgot this incident and worshipped the idol of vet school.  I was still tempted by prestige and accolades.  See, I'm no better than the Israelites because I have seen God just as clearly and yet have given in to temptation just as quickly. This verse reminds me that I am never safe from temptation and that I constantly need to be on guard. God will never tempt be beyond what I can bear and He will always provide a way out for me.  What a comfort!  God knows me so well...    What temptation do I need to guard against?  Well, how about the obvious first?  B is coming in two days (!!!) and I know that we will be tempted to become too intimate with eachother.  We just like eachother too darn much...  As if to prepare for what seems to be inevitable, we talked about this temptation together.  It seems like our conclusion is usually "Well, we'll try our best to keep our hands off eachother but let's just wait and see what happens."  Like I said, it seems almost inevitable that we will cross the line.  I remember talking about this in Boston--how we should cool things down a bit when we're together.  But, surprise, suprise, we end up naked...again.  But no, this verse reminds me that falling into temptation isn't inevitable.  God always gives us a way out in the form of a CONSCIENCE.  I don't know about guys and their raging hormones, but even in the heat of the moment, I still feel that pang of guilt. I remain level-headed enough to be able to stop what's happening, but I don't.  So basically, sin is a choice and I fall into temptation because I want to.  I'm NOT a victim after all.  Intimacy will definately be a temptation, but it's one that we are able to overcome.    B says that he hasn't felt guilty about crossing the line with me.  That surprised me. I didn't think it was possible to not feel guilty about doing something you know is wrong.  For me, I need to do my part and clean up my thought life.  The more I think about making out with him, the more I'm going to push things in that direction when he's here.  I need to not anticipate that. Instead, I should just expect to cuddle and have fun, which is more than enough already.  Maybe we should go w/ B's suggestion and I should put a bag over my head and put mittens on his hands.      Lord, thank you for knowing me so well and yet loving me so much. You know exactly how much temptation I can handle.  I confess that I sin because I want to, and I take responsibility of that.  I know that nothing in all creation is hidden from your sight (Hebrews 4:13) and that you see every sin I commit. Brandon is comming in a few days and I pray that you will enhance our relationship by helping us to practice self-control. Nothing good can ultimately come out of premature physical intimacy. I pray that during the time we spend together this weekend, we will grow closer together by growing closer to you. Please be with us as we do our quiet times together and learn to love you as a couple and as individuals.  Relight the flame in our hearts that have been quenched by business, and skewed priorities.  The passion that we have for eachother needs to be redirected towards a passion for you.  That is my desire, Lord, but I'm weak!  Help us to be a good example for the younger ones and an encouragement to our peers this weekend.  Amen.

      **1 Corinthians 9:26-27--"Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.  No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."  Why do I run this race?  Why do I work so hard?  Is it to "get a crown that will not last", or to "get a crown that will last forever"?  This is a good reminder to me that my body is expendable for Christ.  I've grown so comfortable with getting whatever I want, whenever I want it.  There's no doubt that I've lived a privileged life, which is a gift from God.  Do I truely know what it means to "beat my body and make it my slave" for the sake of Christ?  It seems like what Paul is talking about in these verses is having a sense of PURPOSE to all of hard work.  Yes, I could stay up long hours, skip meals, and turn down invitations to have fun, but this is all in the name of vet school.  This isn't necessarily bad because this is where God wants me to be, but once again, I need to have the mindset of using this position to honor God. My PURPOSE for being in vet school is to love others and to worship God in all that I do.     Lord, thank you for reminding me that this body that I've carried around for 26 years is  still  yours. I've done so much backsliding and I've forgotten so many of the times that you've been faithful to me. Despite my unfaithfulness, I am still your child, and you still desire to call me your own. Use my body, Lord, while I still have time, to do your work on this earth.  There is nothing I would rather do than to spend my days worshipping you.  All the meaningless little tasks I do don't satisfy me like as much as doing your work.  Lord, what can I do with my hands, my mouth, my legs to worship you?  What work do you have for me and where do you want me to go?  If loving your people means inconveniencing myself, losing sleep when a friend needs someone to talk to, or putting aside something "fun" for the sake of caring for someone else, then let it be. Let the work of my hands serve not to bring attention to myself (which is very tempting for me) but to point the way to you.  As the song goes, "Take my life and let it be, consecrated Lord to Thee.  Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of Thy love, at the impulse of Thy love."  Amen.

      I just finished my radiology final and now I'm waiting for Tiffany to finish.  Overall, it was easier than thought it would be, considerng that I only studied half-heartedly all weekend.  It makes me a little worried because there are still a lot of people who aren't done yet so it makes me wonder if I rushed through it carelessly.  I don't think so because  I was pretty confident about the answers I put.  Then again, I was pretty sure about my answers for the last repro quiz and I only got 7/10... Well, I shouldn't be conscious about how quickly other people finished anyway.  I guess that's another thing I need to work on--comparing myself to other people too much.  I'm feeling kinda crampy to day so I'm glad that I don't have class again until 1pm.  Two hours of small animal medicine...bleh.  I feel like such a dummy when it comes to respiratory diseases.  Do dogs get allergic rhinitis or not?!?!  My notes say "no", but Nozomi and my practical experience say "yes".  *sigh*  3.5 for days until B comes!!  I'm glad that I'll be busy between now and then with the Mercer VAD because that will make the time go by faster.  I almost wish that I hadn't done the Anesthesiology midterm so early because now I have nothing to work on when I get home.  Idleness absolutely drives me crazy!  I feel the need to be busy all the time, or else I feel unproductive, and unproductiveness = :( .  I think I'll go home and do my QT (which reminds me that I should order _Experiencing God_).  Another thing I need to do: write and mail thank-you notes to Sue and Tracy for their birthday gifts.  It kinda makes me bummed that Jon completely missed my birthday.  I don't even think he realizes even now that it was last week.

      So sleepy, and yet it's only 11:15pm.  Am I getting old?  Maybe I'm still on East Coast time! I wish...  I talked to B tonight after he got back from New York and we have totally reconciled.  Whew!  He's so wonderful!  4 more days and counting...  I'm still thinking of ordering "Experiencing God" by Henry Blackaby.  I feel kind of aimless with my quiet time lately and I think that I need something to read that will take me through the characteristics of God.  I really enjoyed the excerpts of the book I've read and it seems like it will be a good addition to my library.  It seems like I'm searching for books on spiritual living as kind of a substitute for having a spiritual leader.  I need to be taught somehow, whether it's from a book or from a real person.  I know that the Bible is sufficient, but I need something else to help me interpret the Bible. More and more when I read passages during QT (which isn't as frequent as I would like), I feel like I'm merely GUESSING at what the author is trying to say. I could be totally off and would never know without the help of someone wiser.  I keep saying that I crave spiritual leadership in my life, but yet I'm not being very proactive in actually finding someone.  Auntie Denise and Auntie ALice always say "let's get together!" when I run into them, but that rarely seems to happen.  As for Auntie Denise, I don't really feel that much of a connection with her.  She's kind of "soft" for lack of a better adjective. I need someone who's going to be harder on me and discipline me.  I trust Auntie Alice--afterall, I've known her since 3rd grade, but I feel like there's tiny bit of a cultural and language barrier.  Goodness, why am I so picky?!?!?  I really like Val Wong and her testimony really touched me when she spoke last month at the girl's accountibility meeting.  What's keeping me from meeting with her?  It's been so long since I've had a spiritual leader that I don't quite know what to do anymore.    More and more I feel isolated, not just from a spiritual leader, but also from my peers at church--just the sisters of course. I still care about each one of them, but I really don't now what's going on in their lives.  I feel like there is so much untapped potential in the sisters of our group.  I want so much to sit down with each of them and have a heart-to-heart talk, or just hang out.  Sometimes I envy Ruth because she is able to have the kind of life since she's not working.  She can meet girls for lunch, plan Bible studies, lead small groups, write people e-mails, etc.  Besides loving the sisters, her other job is to make a home for herself and Wayne.  Planning meals, cleaning, decorating, trying new recipes, baking, entertaining friends and in-laws, what a wonderful life!!!  It would be so EASY for me to give up veterinary medicine for that kind of domestic life.  I know that that kind of life isn't easy either, but I think it would be much more fulfilling than sitting in front of my notes and computer all day (including weekends) instead of building meaningful relationships with people.  Maybe this is a selfish desire because I really enjoy cooking, cleaning, and entertaining and I'm actually GOOD at it (if I can say so myself).  I can't really say the same about vet med all the time.  It's not that I don't enjoy vet school, because I do--ALOT.  Sometimes when I'm studying for Small Animal Medicine, I'm literally  overflowing  with happiness. I know that sounds totally cliche, but I'm telling you, it's absolutely true.  I just feel like hugging people when I'm studying for SA Medicine because I'm so happy.  I've mentioned my desire to be a housewife to B before and he definately thinks I should be a vet.  I agree, because it's not like God made a mistake in putting me in vet school.  I'm on this track for a reason.  God seems to think that I could serve him best as a veterinarian instead of a housewife.  I trust His plan, but I'm ready at a moment's notice to drop my degree and make a home.  Sometimes I actually HOPE that this will happen.  It's hard because I don't go to CAT anymore so I rarely have the opportunity to hang out with the girls anymore.  I really really wish that Tracy would hurry up and move back so we could hang out more.  THe only way that's going to happen is if she comes back with a diamond ring on her finger from Todd.  I'm all for that though!  They're an excellent couple with an awesome testimony about their relationship.  I only wish that B and I could have an equally powerful testimony someday--not that I'm comparing our relationship to Todd and Tracy's of course.  It's just that they're life exemplifies that two is truely better than one and that we have a God of redemption.    Anyhoot, my eyes are thoroughly tired now and I'm completely burned out on radiology for today.  Up at 6am tomorrow?  I still haven't gone through the exotic animal stuff, nuclear medicine, and the CT/MRI stuff yet.  *sigh*  It's funny that in this class, rabbits, rats, and snakes are considered "exotic".  I would think that animals like tigers would be considered "exotic", but I guess they are anatomically like big cats. Well, actually, I guess that's exactly what they are.  Anyway, how often would I get to radiograph a tiger during my career?  That would be cool, but scary.

      I've been thinking about B all day because of our conversation last night. We rehashed my dilemma about Mike, but I finally did come to a conclusion.  I've been thinking all along that I need to be Mike's friend in order to help him.  B pointed out to my last night (and the night before) that not communicating to him would be best for him and for me.  It would force him to consider why all his "friends" are avoiding him and eliminate a source of stress for me at the same time.  I'm glad that B pointed this out, because I had never considered this point of view before, but I see now why this is true.  So I've basically decided not to communicate with Mike anymore at all.  So, problem solved, right?  I was totally ready to leave this topic behind, but B didn't seem as ready to move on. He seemed really troubled that I would be willing to "hurt" myself if it meant helping someone or making someone happy. It's true that this part of my personality resulted in an unhealthy relationship with Jerry (among other factors), and this is something that I need to work on.  Given that, I was really hoping that B would be willing to work with me on this and keep me from making similar unhealthy decisions in the future. Afterall, that's what friends do, right?  Instead, he thought that maybe it's not healthy for both of us to be in this relationship while I'm working on my "self-preservation" skills (as opposed to expending myself for others).  It seemed like he was applying this weakness of mine to ALL areas of my life--as if this weakness is an indication of who I am as a whole person.  I tried to tell him that this weakness is a SMALL SMALL part of who I am and all I need is help and encouragement from him and my other friends to overcome this.    What troubles me is that he was so QUICK to doubt the future of our relationship when he found out that I have this fault.  Is our relationship so fragile?!?!  I asked him if he would be willing to help and encourage me or if this was something that he can't handle about me (which would mean an inevitable breakup).  What he said completely shocked me.  He said, "I DON'T KNOW".  Why doesn't he know whether he wants to work with me on this?  Why is he so surprised that I have faults!?!  I was really hoping that when these faults surfaced, he would want to be my source of strength.  Why isn't he sure if he wants to play this role?  If my boyfriend isn't sure if he wants to encourage me, who else on earth do I have?? There are big tears in my eyes right now because it breaks my heart that he would have so little faith in our relationship and most of all, that he doesn't want to help me with my weaknesses.  I have so many of them, and what will happen when he discovers those too?    He said that sometimes he thinks that we are so different. It's true that we are different, but I think that ADDS to our relationship, not detracts from it.  I feel like I can constantly learn from him because of our differences, and I'm very interested in what he has to say.  He called me "stubborn", which is true, but I don't think I was being stubborn with him at that time.  I was just trying to make sure that he understood my point of view.  He doesn't have to agree with it.  If I were truely stubborn, then I wouldn't have even listened to him when he pointed out that not talking to Mike would be best for both of us.  Instead, I DID listen and I even ended up agreeing with him.  Maybe he thought that I was only agreeing with him because I wanted to make him happy, not because that's what I truely believed.  But that's not true!  I really believe for myself that talking to Mike isn't healthy and that's why I've made that decision.  It's true that I am influenced by people, but I also am capable of making my own decisions.  How could I be a good vet if I weren't capable of making independant decisions!?!    Despite all of this, I still want to be his girl. Even when I was expressing my opinions, B still listened well (at least in the beginning when he wasn't that sleepy).  He never raised his voice at me, although I could tell there was frustration in his voice.  He ultimately wants what's best for me. I know that he was frustrated because he doesn't want to see me hurt anymore.  But I do hope that he will develop more tenacity when it comes to our relationship and not be so quick to doubt its "rightness" when our differences surface (which they inevitably will). Does this mean that he's trying to find any excuse to break up with me?  I didn't think so because he's so good about telling me how happy he is with me and how amazing it is that we're together.  I didn't think he was that unhappy with me...but then why would he even suggest that we break up?  The very thought makes me want to cry, but most of all, I want to talk to him.  I hope he calls me soon....

      I'm taking a break from studying radiology. I'm tired of looking at radiographs--I can't tell a kidney from a large bowel loop anymore...  I'm actually really glad that I created a new blog page.  I think I'm able to get my thoughts down much more often then I would on paper.  It also has the added benefit of giving B a peak at my thoughts as well. =)    Tomorrow I'll probably go to UCC again.  I haven't been there for a couple of weeks now.  I'll probably try to go to the 9am service so I can have more of the day to study for radiology.  I got a call from Ty, a guy who is involved in starting the new YA group. They're first meeting is next Wednesday, but that's the evening of the Mercer Volunteer Appreciation Dinner. I'm glad that I got that call because I was beginning to think that I'd been forgotten.  Will this be the start of a regulary Bible study?  I really hope so...I feel like I haven't gone to a regular BS in a long time and I'm getting really lazy with my spiritual life.  Speaking of which, I keep forgetting to ask B whether he's made any progress finding a BS of his own.  Didn't he say that he met the leader of the group the last time he was at church?  Speaking of B...we had a conversation last night when he got home from Spirit (a club in New York that he went to w/ Brian and Christina).  I've been really good about not asking him how much he's had to drink whenever he goes out.  I decided that I need just to trust him to be responsible and I genuinely do. Even if he  was  buzzed, I don't think I could tell anyway...   Mainly we talked about my conflicts with Mike.  By the time I actually talked to Mike, I wasn't mad anymore (it's amazing what a nap can do for anger management). I easily forget about disagreements I've had with people. Does this make me vulnerable to being stepped on over and over by people like Mike?  Maybe that's what B is concerned about.  He doesn't want me to be friends with him (not that he wants me to be mean), and I see his point.  Every time I try to be Mike's friend, I end up getting burned sooner or later. I don't need this kind of angst in my life, of course, but for some reason, I can't help but keep trying to be his friend. Why do I keep trying? Here are some reasons why:     1)I have a very strong desire to please people and I just can't stand it when people are unhappy with me    2)Or maybe it's because I feel obligated to be friends with EVERYONE.      3)I learned (probably at Berkland) that I need to love the unloveable, just as Jesus did on Earth. Jesus loved those that were ostracized by others.  He loved the tax collectors, the prostitutes, the lepors... Mike isn't crippled, but he IS a social outcast.   I'm realizing that to be friends with everyone is both not realistic and not healthy.  Afterall, there are certain people (like Mike), who are not "safe" people to be around. He ends up being a discouraging influence because of his complaining attitude, rudeness, and self-centeredness. No, I definately have decided that I'm NOT going to take any more initiative with him, but I won't ignore him either.    I know that B just wants to protect me, but he kept saying "Do what you want" in a frustrated sort of way. For some reason, "It's up to you" just sounds nicer.  Of course he wants me to make my own decision but I couldn't understand why he was frustrated with me. Maybe he was just frustrated at the situation and not really at me. Does he think I'm a pushover because I care about Mike too much? B's been really good about listening to me vent and being sympathetic. Definately a good thing...

      Wow, what a productive day.  I was thinking that I would rather be crazy busy, on my feet all day and be productive than to be sitting on my butt.  Even when I was the most busy today ordering diagnostics and submitting samples for Georgia, I felt really happy. Today turned out unexpectedly well considering how busy we were. Even as I was walking up the steps to the hospital, I prayed that God would help me seek His approval alone. The morning started out kinda rough and Dr. Rasor was on my case right away about not mentioning the cellulitis to her the night before.  How was I supposed to know that's what it was?!?  I thought it was just serum that had crusted over on the fur... She was nice to me the rest of the day, though, and we actually worked well together.  I talked to DGD today after work.  It was nice to talk to her even more on a "friend" level rather than just talk to her as an older sister (even though that's a blessing too).  We started out talking about how my rotation is going and then a little about B and the tiff we had on Saturday.  Her conclusion was that this was "normal", even though I kinda suspected that already.  The we talked about how Brittney Spears is engaged to a guy she's been dating for only 2 months and how Mary-Kate Olson is in rehab for anorexia.  It would be really nice to visit her when I'm done with my rotation. Why do plane tickets have to cost money?!?  With B and I so busy with our school/work, sometimes I get weary of talking only about that.  But just like B says, that's what we spend 80% of our day doing, so of course we're gonna talk about it.  I see his point, but I'm just looking forward to the time (i.e. later this summer) when we have other things going on in our lives than school.  It's like, we spend all our day there so sometimes I don't want to talk about it when I get home too.  It's not like B is the one to bring it up all the time because I volunteer information about my day at the hospital.  Maybe it's just unavoidable because it's such a big part of our lives right now.  Today B told me that he had a disturbing dream about me leaving him behind. I'm not sure what to make of this.  Whenever I tell him a dream I've had, he always asks me, "Was it good or bad?"  Then I wonder two things, #1: Why would I have a bad dream about him? and #2: How much should I read into these dreams?  As for the second, I didn't really think that dreams meant much because they could be totally random.  Then again, they could manifest our fears too... So when B told me that he had a dream about leaving him behind, I was surprised that I took that so seriously (since I don't take my own dreams about him very seriously).  Is he afraid that I'm going to leave him behind for another guy? Or does that mean that he sees me as unreachable somehow?  He said that he had probably cried in his sleep, which is kind of endearing. If he really is afraid that I'm going to leave him for one reason or another, then that means that he's insecure about how I feel about him.  Maybe I'm not making that clear enough...but I thought he knew.

       **Proverbs 29:23--"A man's pride will bring him low, but the humble in spirit will retain honor."   Pride is at the root of every sin. It motivates me to do things that I know are not Christlike by making MYSELF the center instead of God.  Pride causes me to ignore the Spirit's conviction and causes me to demand my rights. If a humble life pleases God, then a prideful like causes Him grief.    Pride not only makes God unhappy, but it makes me unhappy too.  Pride prevents me from mending broken relationships and constantly living in sin leads to perpetual feelings of guilt.  But God should be the reason for living a humble life, not my own unhappiness.   How do I live a humble life? I often confuse humility with feelings of low self-worth.  Both say, "I am nothing". What then is the difference?   1) Humility makes me realize that I am nothing  in comparison to the greatness of God , whereas low self-worth comes from dissatisfaction with how God has made me.  Humility honors God, where self-defamation dishonors Him.   2) Humility is God-centered, but low self-worth is self-centered. 3) Humility ultimately leads to worshipping God as we realize that God loves us inspite of our lowliness.  Low self-worth ultimately leads to self-pity.  Over the last few days, I have been reminded (because this is nothing new to me) that I have a tendency towards low self-worth.  I have a hard time accepting the limitations that God has given me (limitations that, no doubt, were placed to keep me humble in the first place) and place impossibly high standards on myself. What's the result?  A big, fat pity-party. "Oh woe is me!  You must feel sorry for Christine and all the hardship she has to endure!" It's so ironic that a sense of low self-worth is actually a symptom of PRIDE because it desires to bring attention to oneself.    So how do I become humble instead? The answers are simple, but not easy to do because pride is such a big problem with me.    1) When someone corrects me, accept it and learn from it instead of feeling wronged. This is a big one to remember when I'm in clinics and am constantly corrected by the DVMs. 2) When the Holy Spirit convicts me to seek forgiveness from someone I have wronged, DO IT.  B is so good about  quickly  saying "sorry" when he feels like he has wronged me somehow.  This attitude sets a good example for me, but I still am not as quick to seek forgiveness.  When I was upset and depressed this weekend, there were many things that I said out of frustration, but I was slow and reluctant to say "sorry".  I tried to justify my words and actions by using fatigue as my excuse.  I also often play the part of the victem, and act like it's somehow okay for me to hurt B because I have been hurt.   3) Seek the approval of God alone, not others.  I often crave flattery, which builds up my pride. In the hospital, I really want the clinicians and the other students to think that I'm smart and capable. I think God is trying to break me by denying me of this flattery.  Instead of flattery, I've heard lots of criticism and correction this week. I think this is intentional on God's part because He knows how much I want to hear praise from people. Even when I try to have the attitude of a servant, I do it so people will like me for doing nice things for them, not to show them God's love.  No, this week, I want to have the attitude of a servant and keep in mind that God is my master.  If I work to please God and work to honor him (thus, decreasing my pride), then I will not be hurt by the criticism of others.

      Mmm, yummy.  Salad and a rotisserie chicken (just part of it) for lunch.  Oh man, that just scared the crap out of me.  I was thinking, oh shoot, I should get my pager out of my lab coat just in case someone pages me.  I hardly ever get a page that I'm not expecting, but lo and behold, I have one new page from an unfamiliar number.  I'm thinking the worst--that Beanie's dead in his cage lying in a pool of his own blood.  I call back the number with my hands totally shaking and it turns out that it's Natalie calling about tomorrow's appointments.  She wanted to give my CT/rhinoscopy case to Jessica and was going to give me another case (I just hope it's not the renal failure one).  When she told me it was just that, I was so relieved, I was ready to give her whatever she wanted, including my firstborn child.  Well, I learned my lesson--CARRY YOUR PAGER AT ALL TIMES.  Oh man, I don't even know where to begin in telling about yesterday's self-imposed drama.  So I get rebuked by Dr. Rasor for the 3rd time in, like, 3 days.  I really don't think she's out to get me, but I do think she thinks I'm a naive little 3rd year who needs her hand held when doing anything.  This is mostly true, however, and I would gladly put up with a little hand-holding than to be thrown out to the sharks without any help at all.  The way things are now are better by far than how bad things could be.   This isn't the song I was singing yesterday, when I was thinking about why my letter of withdrawl to the Dean's office would say.  It would probably include a letter from a psychiatrist about how dropping out of vet school would be in the best interest of my mental and emotional health.  I was seriously beginning to think I was retarded.  I literally laid in bed from 10am when I got home from the VMTH until 6pm, getting up only 2-3 times to go to the bathroom and drink some juice.  I cried and dozed on and off during those 8 hours, but thought mostly of B and how awful I was to him and how upset he was at me.  He was only trying to be helpful and offer me suggestions, but I felt like he was trying to point out my problems and try to FIX them instead of encouraging me.  I totally bit his head off and he got fed up with me (I don't blame him--I was fed up with myself too).  Our conversation ended badly and he said that he was "just gonna go", which is always a bad sign.    We talked again a little while later around 3pm and things went from bad to worse.  He knew something was obviously wrong, but I didn't want to tell him that I was still dealing with my feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.  I was afraid he would think I was being a baby and that he wouldn't understand why this was hitting me so hard.  I still don't think he really knows why I don't take criticism well--I just don't.  So I kept on holding back my feelings.  The more he pushed me to tell him what was wrong, the more I didn't want to tell him.  So finally, both of us had enough and he was like, "Just do what you want."  This was a stab in the heart because that sounds exactly like what mom says when she  gives up on me .  Now this man that I care more deeply about than anyone is giving up on me.  Giving up on someone means that person doesn't CARE anymore what you do, even if you are harming yourself.  "Just do what you want" means "Fine, throw yourself in a bottomless pit, see if I care."  I don't think that B meant all this, just that he didn't want to try to get the answer from me anymore.  I don't think he was intentionally trying to be mean and I don't think he knows how much this statement hurts me.  His frustration is totally JUSTIFIED because I was being really difficult and stubborn, so in some ways, I brought this upon myself.   I guess I didn't want to tell him what was going on because I was afraid that he wouldn't like me anymore if I told him.  Yeah, it's easy to like anyone if you think they're cute and smart, but what about when lack of self-confidence and self-esteem surfaces?  What then?  Deep down inside I didn't think that B was going to turn and run, but I did think this was going to cause him to doubt our relationship.  For all I know, he does doubt us. The fact that he still wants to talk to me means a lot.  It means that he's willing to stick by me though the good times and the bad.    We talked a third time late last night and things are looking up. I explained to him that I'm not necessarily looking for advice, but just for someone to listen.  I think he took this too literally because he started to not say ANYTHING. At first I thought he was doing this to be defiant, but I think he thought that's what I wanted--a silent boyfriend.  No, this is the way that Jerry was--totally quiet when I was pouring out my heart, and I felt like I was talking to myself. Most of the time he actually was sleeping while I was talking to him though.  Then I tried to explain to him that I didn't want him to be silent, but then he started asking me rhetorical questions with obvious answers like, "Do you think veterinarians make mistakes?" and "Do you think an animal has ever died because of a mistake a vet made?". This sounds like when Dr. Rasor says to me, "Do you think you can do ALL your treatments done in 10 minutes?"  Well DUH. Instead of making a point, I feel like a kindergardner who is being scolded by the scary principle. You only ask simple questions to simple minded people because that's all they can handle.  When I am asked these kinds of questions, I feel like the other person thinks I can't handle difficult concepts (i.e. Christine=stupid). I really don't think I'm that stupid, but people have done a pretty good job of convincing me otherwise lately.  When I tried to explain where I was coming from to B, he got all confused about what he can and cannot say.  Goodness.  The last thing I want is to block communication between us and make him feel like he can't be honest with me.  Then again, I feel obligated to tell him what hurts me. *sigh* All in all, I think this has brought B and I to a new level of our relationship.  I'm not sure how he feels about all this yet, but I don't think these difficult times are a sign that we shouldn't be together.  It's good to see that he still wants to be with me  in spite of  how I am--not because I'm a "good catch".  This incidence has probably shattered the crystal pedestal he puts me on, but it's a good thing. It's time that he sees the ugly parts of me so he knows what he's getting himself into.  Knowing how patient he is, I think he'd be willing to work with me on my self-esteem issues instead of giving up on me.  This incident has totally kicked up the "dreaminess" factor up another notch.  Hopefully he feels the same way.

      I noticed that when I'm hungry, I'm in a crappy mood, and I'm hungry a lot this time of day.  The doctor at CSHC said that I'm underweight and need to eat more (DUH).  She kept saying that I should eat trail mix, but I didn't have the heart to tell her that I don't like peanuts.  It was starting to sound like she was a spokesperson for a trailmix company.    Last night I found out that my trip to Boston is going to be cut short by two weeks.  Instead of spending that time in Oregon having a blast in Portland and Seattle and making incredible memories with B, I'm going to be sitting on my butt at home with a mom that's perpetually pissed off at me. It's not anyone's fault that B's ticket to Portland was purchased before I realized that I couldn't go, so I'm not asking myself "How did this happen?".  But I keep asking myself, "WHY did this happen?"  B says that God's not punishing us, but I'm not so sure....   Even though I can understand where Mom is coming from and why she doesn't think that going to Portland would be appropriate, it still sucks that I can't go.  Not only am I losing out on the chance to go to B's hometown, but I'm missing out on being with B  at all .  The time that we have together is so rare and precious, that the loss of even a few days is painful. I was having a REALLY hard time accepting this loss last night.  I wasn't angry at mom (even though she's angry at me), just upset that this is the way things are.  B and I kept reminding ourselves that 5 weeks is still a long time--3X longer than our current record for days spent together.  Since we don't have to study, we have every evening and weekends to travel and go out (or stay in).   After all, God gave us this time together, and he's free to take it away if He wants to.  This is definately testing our patience, and our trust that God knows best.  I for one would still rather not learn these lessons and just have our full 7 weeks together.

      Tonight I met up with Jamie (finally) and we had a good conversation.  We were going to have dinner together, but we ended up having boba after worship-based prayer.  I haven't been to WBP in a long time--it was good to pray corporately and individually. I felt embarassed when I got home about an hour ago and I looked in the mirror and realized that I probably shouldn't have worn a skirt this short to church.  It's not like my butt's hanging out of the bottom of my skirt or anything, but the hemline is at my fingertips--or just below.  I guess that's kinda a lot of leg to show at a prayer meeting, eh?  Okay, there won't be a next time.  We sent of Stephen, who is leaving for China in the morning.  I didn't realize that he was leaving so soon or I would have submitted my prayer card to him sooner.  Right now it's sitting on my desk with a stamp on it.  I guess I won't be mailing it after all.    So back to Jamie...we talked a lot about boys and she told me what she's been learning from the books she's been reading about dating.  She's planning on reading 4 of them!  Personally, I think she'd be better off reading the Bible rather than these books, but they seem to be helping her nonetheless.  It's amazing how quickly she's "recovered" from this, although they weren't offically dating I guess.  She was a total mess only 2 weeks ago and now she's really happy.  I just kept thinking that God uses these little tragedies to bring us back to Him.  Jamie was pretty lukewarm spiritually, but now she says she has to cling onto God and constantly pray that He would guard her heart against a new man too quickly.  She's been journaling and she actually has spiritual goals for herself, which I think is amazing coming from her.    The sage continues with trying to get to Oregon during the summer.  Sometimes I wonder when we've reached the point of trying to hard or if it's okay to be persistent.  B and I have always said (also in the context of our relationship), that we shouldn't try to force things.  If we encounter too many red lights, then we should just let it go.  I thought that the high ticket prices were red lights, but B called tonight and said he had some news about flying to Oregon.  I didn't get a chance to talk to him b/c I got home too late but I'm eager to hear what he has to say.  Trying not to get my hopes up again...  Dunno whether I should talk to M & D about going up to Oregon.  I have a feeling they're going to not be agreeable to that....I can't wish that they were any different than they are now, but being so conservative/traditional makes dating harder.  They are so protective of me, but I try not to resent that (I'm not trying very hard).  My tendency is to do what I want and then tell them about my plans later.  That doesn't go over very well with Mom b/c she feels like I'm excluding her from my life. Maybe I am to some degree in my quest for independence, but it's more that I'm afraid that she'll say "no" if I ask her permission.  Ben has something up his nose and he keeps sneezing.  He hasn't been his usual self cuz he hasn't been bothering Cheese lately.  Hopefully he'll sneeze out whatever it is or it'll be $$$ for a rhinoscopy. Maybe he can hold out until July when my professional courtesy renews or maybe I can sneak him into the clinic during my IM rotation next week and do the rhinoscopy myself w/ Dr. Johnson (aka. Respiratory Queen) present.  Poor Ben Ben.  Well, this is a good learning experience for me since we just had our final on respiratory diseases.  Tiffany and I were going through a list of differentials and trying to localize the disease to the nose just like we learned in class.  It's kinda cool that we actually get to apply what we're learning.  It makes the material seem much less theoretical.    Well, busy day tomorrow so I'd better be going to bed.  I'm trying to maximize my 4 days of vacation by hanging out with people, so it'll be a fun kind of business.

      Found out today that I did as bad as I thought on my Food Safety final--"C", but did better than I thought in the class overall--"A".  I'm glad that Dr. Cliver is one of the very few teachers at school who actually curve grades.  So all the tears and freaking out were for nothing--what is God trying to teach me here?    1) I shouldn't freak out about something that I don't know for certain yet 2) Grades are WAY too important to me--just look how I overreacted.  I haven't cried that hard since I watched "The Yearling" and I'm not even PMSing (I don't think). 3) What's ultimately important is not my grade, but how well I can apply the material. There's a spiritual lesson here too... 4) God is full of surprises and reminders that He is still in control.     B is going to ask his dad today about the possibility of going to Oregon for the first 1.5 weeks of our vacation.  The first time I looked into this, I really had my hopes up.  Now that the door has possibily opened again, I'm trying to be careful not to raise my hopes again.  I think it would be awesome to go so we can spend time with his parents.  Most of all, I think this will give me a window into his high school/college life. B has told me a lot of how he spent those years, but I think that meeting his friends and going to the places he used to go to will give me an even clearer picture of that time in his life.  In a sense, those 10 years are still kind of a mystery to me and visiting Oregon will bring more "temporal continuity" to the person I know now.  It would be awesome to meet Pastor Kurt and Tom, and spend time wtih his folks--people who have influenced him a lot over the years. It sounds strange, but I feel like I owe them a lot for the way they have helped to shape B into the amazing person he is.  I just want to shake their hand and bake them cookies or clean their house or something.... I don't sound like I'm getting my hopes up do I!?!? =)

      For my own health and sanity, I really need to start blogging more.  I noticed that when I don't do my QT and blog, I get cranky, pessimistic, rude, selfish, and start to hate school. Sounds lovely, don't it? I don't know why I haven't been keeping up with my journaling/QT.  Finals are breathing down my neck right now, but I really think that spending a few minutes here and there to reflect on and appreciate what God is doing is definately worth it.  As for finals, two down--two more to go.  This quarter is a breeze compared the 7-final nightmare last quarter. I was overly upset about how terrible I did on my Food Safety final on Friday.  I studied really hard and did my best, but I was discouraged that my best only earns me a "B".  I got a "B" on today's Small Animal Medicine final, but I've swallowed this one a bit better.  I was thinking about why after I dropped Tiffany off (about an hour ago).  I think I've finally accepted the fact that I am a "B" student and those few "A"'s that I do get are merely bonuses.  The advice that Mom gave me when I was growing up is now coming back to me, "Just do your best!".  I believe that I  am  doing my best and I can't expect myself do perform better than I am able.  I think what was the most upsetting was knowing that I have an intellectual upper limit--that is, I can only do so well, no matter how hard I try.  I think accepting this truth will help me to accept not just my grades better, but also it will help me to accept MYSELF.  God will never challenge me beyond what He knows I can bear (1 Cor. 10:13), so why should I expect more from myself than God does?  Another bonus that came out of the whole Food Safety final fiasco was that I got to witness once again how dreamy my Smoochie really is.  He was so wonderful in talking to me and encouraging me even though I could barely respond through my choking sobs.  Last time I cried about a "B" last year, Jerry actually LAUGHED at me and didn't make any attempt to make me feel better.  He actually made me cry HARDER. How insensitive....but it has made me realize how wonderful B is in comparison.  I think this incident has made me check off yet another item on my "must-have" list of qualities I want in a husband--that is, the ability to be sensitive to things that make me sad. He really seemed to understand what I was feeling, maybe because he's a student now too.

      Vet school 'n me have a love/hate relationship going on right now.  I like studying SA medicine, but I feel like it's interfering with what I really want to do--like spend time with friends (before they forget who I am), hang out with the high schoolers, read, reflect, spend time with B... It's times like these that I appease myself by fantasizing about alternate careers, if you can really call them that.  I feel a list coming on...  Here are some of my fantasy jobs (no particular order): 1) Makeup counter girl at a large department store 2) Housewife/home-maker 3) Waitress at a diner 4) Work retail at a store like Gap or AE, or Bath and Body works.  Just shoot me. Please. Put me out of my misery. If anything is going to drive me to alcoholism, it would be vet school.  Can someone become an alcoholic just by drinking enough Smirnoff Ice?  Since my bladder isn't big enough to drink more than two of those, maybe I'll settle for drowning my sorrows in tapioca pearl tea.  Oh yeah--that would be a cool job too--working at Tapioca Express or at a cafe.  Add that to the list.  Waaaaaaaahhhhh! I'm glad there aren't any matches near me or my syllabus would be up in flames by now.

      Why do I hafta pee right when I sit down to write? *sigh*  Here are two bodily functions I could definately do without: eating and peeing.  Why can't girls just pee in a bag like guys can? I don't know any guys who actually do that, but still, they have the OPTION of peeing in a bag whereas girls don't.  Well, I guess girls can technically do anything, but it would be a whole lot messier if girls tried do that.  Sometimes I feel like God gave girls the short end of the stick when it comes to our bodies.  Just think:   1) Monthly cramps and mood swings 2) Weaker upper body strength 3) Inability to pee in a bag 4) Having to push something the size of a watermelon through a hole the size of a walnut...   Well, to think on the bright side,  1) Boys smell and they sweat, girls don't (unless they have a sebaceous cyst) 2) Girls don't have cooties 3) Girls can tell a boy to lift something heavy and they can't say "no". 4) You can kick a girl in the crotch and it won't hurt that bad  After all the rhetoric, I still have to pee.

       **Proverbs 16:2--"All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord"   Today's passage particularly reminds me of my old nature, which doesn't seem so old anymore... In my testimony (which I've told many times), I always describe my old self as one who was motivated by a desire to please people.  Every time I would ask people "How are you?" or help someone out, my motivation would be to increase my popularity or to be seen as a "nice" girl.  Very little of my behavior was motivated by a desire to point people to God or to obey God's command to love others.  It was all about Christine and how I could make myself look good.  After I accepted Christ as my Savior, my motives changed.  Slowly, I began to take a genuine interest in people and did things for others so they could know that love comes from God.  Actually, I learned how to do this from my leaders and unnis at Berkland.  Just as God gradually taught me to love people genuinely, I have slowly been forgetting how to love others this way and trying to bring attention to myself again.  I need to remember that my motivating factor needs to be LOVE, just as Jesus had no other motive.   Lord, thank you for reminding me today that I need to make YOU my motivating factor for all that I do.  Forgive me for using pride as my motivating factor for talking to and being kind to people.  Please help me to remember that I am on this earth to bring glory to YOU and to tell YOUR story, not to bring attention to myself.       More of you, less of me.  Oh my Father, I want to be  A spotless vessel so all can see  More of you and less of me    Amen.    **Praises!**  1)Smoochie & Me: Praise God for great communication with B and increasing closeness with him. 2)B: Thankful that B did his QT two days in a row now.  More than that, he is eager to talk about what he has learned and asks me what I read today too. He's honest about his tendency to "keep record of wrongs" (1 Cor. 13:5). Praise God for his spritual growth! It's true that when we are both on top of our QT, our relationship is that much better...  **Prayer Requests**  1)Daddy:Eyelid surgery tomorrow--Pray for a quick recovery and that this would somehow bring M & D closer together. 2)Sue: Eliviation from TMJ pain and for an appointment with the ortho specialist soon. 3)B and Me: Continued diligence with our quiet time and ever-increasing love for God and eachother.

       **Luke 8:15--"But the seed on good soil stands for those wtih a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop."   What kind of soil does my heart contain?   1)  Trampled ground : Hardened by the sin of bitterness and unforgiveness; unable to accept a message from God. 2)  Shallow soil : Accept God's word in my mind, but the truth will not penetrate my heart to make a difference in my actions. 3)  Thorny soil : Distracted by the cares of the world; the pursuit of earthly pleasures prevents God's Word from taking hold and producing rightnessness. 4)  Good soil : Receives the word from God, aplies it, and brings forth fruit in due time.  I think I most identify with the shallow soil.  I often listen well to the messages, take notes, agree with the pastor, and then go home unchanged.  I need to meditate on God's word so that it penetrates not only my mind, but in my heart.  I need to have more than just an intellectual assent regarding the truth in God's word.   How do I cultivate good soil in my heart?  I need to repent of bitterness, anger, cynicism, and unforgiveness in my heart.  These things make my heart hard.  Even if I hear God's word day after day, it will not change me.  I'm so tired of being all talk and no action.  How long will it take for me to act upon my convictions? I finally want God's word to penetrate my heart so that I will live a changed life.  I see the potential of living a changed life, now that I'm back in His word and spending time with Him daily.    It's true that the condition of my heart will change daily, depending on how I cultivate it.  I need to guard my heart against complacency and thinking that I'm more than I am. Romans 12:3--"Do not think of yourselves more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you."  I need to be mindful of DAILY cultivating a heart that will absorb God's word and allow it to change my life.  Once again, I need to repent and daily give myself over to God.  Most of all, I need to ASK God to forgive me.    "The Word of God is sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart." (Hebrews 4:12)  God's word is this powerful, but it fails to change me because of the hardness of my heart (from lack of repentance), not because of its impotency.    Lord, thank you for Your Word.  It has the power to change me, if only my heart were fertile soil.  You gave me the Bible so I can learn about who you are and what pleases you.  It teaches me how to worship and to discern right from wrong.  It tells me about who You are, how much you love us, and what a low tolerance you have for idolatry and willful disobedience.  It also tells me about how I am and how often I do what I do not want to do because my flesh is weak (Romans 7:15) It teaches and disciplines me, it gives me comfort and encouragement.  It is full of stories of faulty people like Abraham and Moses as a testimony that You can use anyone for Your kingdom.  It gives me hope that you can use even me.    Please forgive me for not taking your Word seriously.  I want Your truth to penetrate my heart so that I can live for you, not for myself.  I want to be changed by Your word.  Help me to diligently read the Bible and daily prepare my heart to put your commands into action.  Amen.    **Prayer Requests**  1) Jamie: Broke up with Alvin last weekend and is struggling with understanding what happened.  Pray that she would cry out to God during this time, because He is the only one who will be completely faithful to her and will fulfill all her needs. 2) Brandon: Pray that the fire that was rekindled at church camp will not be quenched now that he is back in Boston.  Pray for a hunger for God's Word that will result in diligence in his quiet time.  My hope is that he will spend time with God not out of a sense of duty or obligation, but out of a genuine desire to know his Savior.  I pray that God would give us certainty (in His time) about the future of our relationship. 3) Brian Lee: A return to his first love and escape from New York.  He needs someone in his life that will lead in back to God and remind him of the God he knew in his youth. 4) Sue: Relief from TMJ pain.  She needs a nightguard SOON.   Lord, will you make a way so that her insurance will cover the costs completely?  You are able.   5) Mary: Reconciliation with her mom regarding the conflict they had yesterday.  I know that Mary feels very frustrated with her parents and feels like they are very critical of her.  Pray that she would be able to enroll in that required course next term.  If that is not the Lord's will, then I pray for patience regarding the timing of her marriage to Kevin. 6) Priscilla: Wedding in two weeks! Pray for peace in her heart regarding Enoch's parents. Pray that preparations will go smoothly and stress-free. 7) Driving to SF tonight to pick up Meem.  Pray for safety and patience with and LOVE for M & D and Meem.

      I've been feeling perpetually sleepy today, probably because I woke up suddenly at 7:48am for my 8am class.  I even took a nap today when I got home today too, and I still feel like I could sleep for another couple of hours. Part of me is convinced that taking naps actually makes you MORE sleepy for the rest of the day.  Maybe if I forced myself to stay awake after class I wouldn't feel groggy--how ironic.  My room smells like a litter box.  What's scary is that I'm actually getting used to it.  Last night we had girl's accountibility group.  It was good during the study, but during the drive home, I had a lot of regrets about some of the things I said that evening.  Since all of us (except for Jamie) are either married or dating, we talked a lot about relationships.  I kept thinking about how Jamie was feeling and if she felt left out of the conversation.  I honestly can't tell if she resented the conversation, but she did ask some questions that related to her breakup with Alvin.  I felt like I was giving her a lot of unsolicited advice.  Instead of being helpful, I think I sounded insincere.  When I broke up with Jerry, I vowed that I would try my best to never make any of the single girls feel alienated for not having a boyfriend.  I know it wasn't intentional, but I often felt left out of the conversation or out of activities by couples during my single days.  When I was dating Jerry, I was one of those people who "rubbed in" the fact that I was dating someone--outright flaunting it.  Right after the breakup, I felt sad when I saw people holding hands or going places together, and wished that I was in a relationship too.  Now the tables were turned....These sad feelings gradually subsided as time passed and I became more comfortable with being single.  I promised myself that when I started dating again, I would do my best not to alienate those who are single.    Last night I felt like Jamie felt left out of the conversation, and I felt bad about going back on my committment.  I was IMing her just now and I asked her if she felt uncomfortable with our conversation.  She said she didn't but that she felt sad that she wasn't able to participate more in the dialogue.  From now on, I'm going to remember to be more sensitive to those that are single and not talk about Brandon unless they ask.  This is challenging because I love to talk about him and I'm so happy about our relationship.

       **Mark 1:14-15--After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 'The time has come,' he said. 'The kingdom of God is near.  Repent and believe the good news!'"   It's a new thought to me that repentance is a POSITIVE thing.  It is portrayed negatively, for some reason, and people choose to "rededicate" rather than to repent.  What's the difference between repentance and rededication?  Rededication is a desire to try better next time, whereas repentance is a "dramatic and decisive change of course".  There is  action  inherent in repentance, whereas rededication is more like wishful thinking.    Yes, repentance is definately a necessary and ongoing part of the Christian life. Not only is it necessary, but it is GOOD and it shows God's loving nature. Afterall, repentance is a requirement of salvation (see Isaiah 30:15--"In repentance and rest is your salvation...".  When I'm on a path toward destruction, God urges me to repent to save me from the consequences of sin.  He calls me to "Repent and live!" (Ezekial 18:32) When I'm in sin, God warns me by telling me to repent.  An unloving God will allow me to do what I want and put myself in danger.  I God who loves me enough to warn me of danger.    How does one repent?  Repentance involves a "radical change in heart and mind.  It means that I agree with God's evaluation of my sin and take  specific action  to align myself with His will.  Again, the emphasis is on taking action to correct the deviation away from what is right.  So, repentance is 1) a mental acknowledgement that what I have done is wrong, 2) an acceptance of God's judgement, and 3) an action taken to align myself with His will. Note that is not a PLAN of action (that would be more like rededication), but an active response.  A desire to change is not repentance.  "The evidence of repentence is not words of resolve, but a changed life."  I can't tell you how good I am at giving God lip service.  At every girl's accountibility meeting, I tell everyone how terrible I feel about having a certain attitude or for doing/not doing such and such.  Then I go home and completely forget about my resolve to change.  I rededicate my life, but where is the change?!?  This means that I have not truely repented.  Honestly, I'm scared to even think about the things that I need to repent about.  I think I've become cynical about my ability to change myself, my attitude, and my habits.  It's not that I don't have enough will power (although that may be a contributing cause), but it's more like I'm not desperate enough to want change yet.  I know that God doesn't ask any more of me than I am able to give, so I think I should start small.  First, off I think that my relationship with M & D definately could use some improvement.  I haven't been good lately about calling them every week--maybe because I feel like we don't have much to talk about and they don't seem thrilled to hear from me.  But, I noticed that when I don't call, they notice. As a step in the right direction, I'm going to call them--right now.

       **2 Corinthians 5:11--"Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men.  What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience."   Brandon and I were just talking about having a healthy fear of God during one of our talks in the gazebo at Church Camp, so this reading is timely.  This subject has perplexed me for a while, because as His child, I no longer have to fear condemnation (Romans 8:1).  So why should I still fear God?  I think what God is saying through this passage is that I should have an increased  awareness  of God, knowing that all that I do/think is made plain before Him (Hebrews 4:13).  Apostle Paul knew that he would someday have to "appear before the judgement seat of Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:10), as will I someday.  I will be judgemed so that I "may receive what is due for the things (I) have done in the body, whether good or bad". This awareness of God's omnicience and impending judgement should translate into a turning away from sin.  I suppose, then, that a fear of the Lord is not a fear of His wrath, but a feeling of awe of God's HOLINESS and an awareness of His constant presence.    Do I really see God as a Holy God, awesome and mighty, or do I see him as a benevolent Father who will look the other way when daddy's girl is doing something naughty?  As Henry Blackaby says in his book _Experiencing God_, we are taught  not  to fear.  God is portrayed in Sunday School as soft and loving and as our "best friend". As a result, I have become complacent in my sin.  It's not that God is stern and cold, of course, but I need to have a proper perception of His Holiness.    A reverence for God will dramatically alter the way I worship and how I live my life.  God will be much BIGGER to me if I see Him as the mighty, all-knowing God that He is.  God will become bigger and I will necessarily become smaller in perspective.  A deep sense of awe of God will change my life because I will no longer limit Him in my prayers.  I often pray for things that I think are "do-able", like granting safety on a trip, that a friend will find a job, or enhancing my relationship with Brandon.  Rarely do I pray for someone to be healed from a chronic illness or for our government--things I don't have control over and seem impossible to change.  As the song goes, God really is bigger than the Boggieman.  If I start seeing God as bigger and more awesome, then I will start praying bigger prayers.  The bigger prayers I pray, the more miraculous the answers will be.    Lord, you really are bigger than my view of you right now.  I often limit you to what I think You are able to accomplish, but I now realize that you are able to do much more than I could ever dream.  Lord, you ARE able.  You have searched me and you know me (Psalms 139:1).  This both gives me great comfort, and also heightens my conscience because I know you are constantly watching me.    You are so much more than a benevolent grandfather--You are the creator of the Heavens and the earth and you have the power to create as well as to destroy.  You were that burning bush to Moses and the pillar of fire to the Egyptians.  You parted the sea so they could cross and send them manna and quail from heaven every day.  You FIGHT for me, and I only need to be still (Exodus 14:14).  You are awesome and powerful and I can ask for anything in Your name. Forgive me for being complacent in my sin and taking advantage of Your grace.  I want to see You as You really are--HOLY. Amen.    Prayer Requests:  1)Sue needs a night guard--pray that her insurance will conver the cost or that she will find a way to procure the money to pay for it. Pray for relief from pain due to her TMJ. 2)Brian--pray that he would get out of New York City and come back to Christ--His first love. 3)Jamie--pray that she would cling onto God during this time of heartbreak.  Pray that God would change her through her 6-month dating fast.     4)Pray for the girl's accountibility night tomorrow

      I really should be studying right now, but there are so many other things that I'd rather be doing.  I haven't blogged for a few days also, with the business of being at church camp and all, so I have a lot to tell.  I just got off the phone with B not too long ago.  So far, I think we're handling this term of separation pretty well.  I would do almost anything to see him right now, but I think I've come to the point of accepting that this just isn't possible.  Last night he had the idea that we should spend the first half of our vacation in Portland.  I thought this was an excellent idea and I did a flurry of research on how much it would cost to make that trip possible.  It turns out that it would cost a ridiculous amount of money--$321 MORE to go to Portland.  A roundtrip ticket from Boston would cost B $448!  To B, that was pretty much a closed door, but I would have gladly paid the expense if it meant seeing his parents, Tom, Pastor Kurt, and his other friends.  Yes, it's a lot of money, but it would have been worth it.  I don't regret the decision not to go, though, because such a high expense really  is  a closed door.  We will have plenty of other opportunities to go to Portland during Thanksgiving and Christmas time.  Still, it would have been nice to go during the warmer months, but maybe next year...

      I really feel like I want to get one of those disposable cameras that can give you digital pics.&nbsp; I want to post digital pics of B and me on my blog so I can look at them whenever I want to.&nbsp; Yesterday I showed DGD the group picture with B in it taken 2 years ago at Todd's 4th of July BBQ.&nbsp; She was so funny--while I was downloading the picture, she was like, "I've never seen a picture of him before!&nbsp; This is an important moment!" She even covered her face until I had the picture fully downloaded so she can see it all at once.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; I think she has high hopes for our relationship because of how well Mom is responding to it.&nbsp;   I've had a good time here in LA so far. DGD and I talked for a long time last night.&nbsp; I told her about the whole housing fiasco with Aviv and what I learned on my IM rotation.&nbsp; Then I told her about my own search for an apartment and how I found one for $800.&nbsp; When she heard that my rent was nearly going to double (I pay $445 now) she was a little shocked and didn't think it was such a good idea. "How is this going to affect your budget!?!", she said.&nbsp; I told her I would have to cut back, but I honestly can't think of any more ways that I can live more simply.&nbsp; Mom usually pays for my clothes if we go shopping (which is rarely happens&nbsp;during the school year) and my only other expenses are cell phone, utilities, gas, and food.&nbsp; Well, lately I have been spending quite a bit more on airfare to Boston and LA, but I'm not sure if these fall into the catagory of "luxury" or "necessity".&nbsp; She asked me if I considered getting a roomate later on to share the cost, but I told her that I was planning on living alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm already one to be money conscious and that fact that she doesn't like how high my rent is makes me even more worried.&nbsp; Afterall, she DOES support me financially so she does have a somewhat of&nbsp;a right to say how she wants me to spend the money she gives me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked me if Mom has been giving me money, and I told her that she&nbsp; gave me cash for my Boston and this LA trip.&nbsp; I honestly don't know how much she gave me because I didn't actually count it.&nbsp; I told DGD about $300, but it's probably more.&nbsp; She gave me a high wad of cash a few weeks ago (which I haven't spent a dime of so far) &nbsp;and another wad yesterday.&nbsp; Some of it is going into the Christine and Brandon Fund because I feel bad that B has been contributing so much.&nbsp;

      Wow, what a gi-normous day.&nbsp; The morning had a rough start with a verbal dual with Julie (our first and probably our last) over subleasing my room. I won't go into it further because I don't want to relive those strong feelings now that they have finally faded.&nbsp; I tried hard to concentrate on the sermon and worship service today, but I was mostly preoccupied with what I'm going to do with Aviv's living situation.&nbsp; All in all, it worked out well and everyone's happy--except I'm back where I started and out $445 for August.   I spent most of the afternoon showing Aviv around the VMTH, Davis, taking him around to run errands, and going back and forth to his new place.&nbsp; I don't regret spending a lot of time helping him out because I could only hope that someone would do the same for me if I were in a foreign country. It was fun talking about our culture and language differences.&nbsp; We even got on the topic of religious differences with him being from Israel and all.&nbsp; Not only has this tiny country of 5 million people (just a fraction of the size of California) been the stage for thousands of years&nbsp;of Christian history, it also continues to make immense ripples in today's current events.&nbsp; Wow, I really should pay more attention to what's going on in the Middle East.   I was surprised to learn that there is a substantial population of Muslims living in Israel.&nbsp; How could anyone NOT be a Christian in the Holy Land?&nbsp; Aviv is "not religious" yet he literally lives just off the Sea of Galilee. How cool would that be to walk literally in the footsteps of Christ--to sit where He may have sat and to see the same landscape?&nbsp; Israel may be called the Holy Land, but&nbsp;guess there is nothing&nbsp;holy about the land itself afterall because it does not move everyone who visits to be holy (Aviv, for example).&nbsp; I guess that goes to show that your environment alone does not influence your belief.&nbsp; It's silly to think that yet I somehow thought that people in Israel were automatically Christians or Jewish just because they are surrounded by so much Biblical history.&nbsp;   I'm at DGD's house now.&nbsp; I'm really sleepy now so I'll write more about that tomorrow.

      Well, today has been slightly more productive than yesterday, but only just slightly.&nbsp; I finally e-mailed Dr. Fox today. I hope he remembers that I'm coming in 2 weeks. I think it hit me today that I'm going to Boston for a purpose other than to hang out with B.&nbsp; I was like, "Oh yeah...I'm doing an externship, huh?" I think I need to start taking this thing a little more seriously or else the people at MIT are going to think I'm a slacker. I need to at least  pretend  that I'm there to work, not just to see my b/f.   Today I hung out a little bit with Jon and Ruth. They had lunch at Dos Coyotes, but I just had a drink since I already ate. It was a little awkward hang out with them, I don't know why. They seemed to be having more of a conversation amongst themselves and I felt a tiny bit left out but not enough to hold it against them. Afterwards I went to Bereans with Ruth because she needed to pick up a book. We talked a little in the car.&nbsp; Ruth and I actually have really good converations about meaningful topics, but it just take a little while to get it going. We talked about "emotional boundaries"--something that I've never heard of.&nbsp; She said that just as a dating couple should have physical boundaries, a married couple should have emotional boundaries. This means that one partner should not&nbsp;become too emotionally attached to someone of an opposite gender except for their spouse.&nbsp;To do otherwise would be "emotional adultery".&nbsp; This makes sense. For instance, if I were married, it would be wierd and wrong for me to have a guy best friend that I confided in more than my husband. Emotional boundaries.

       I feel like a lazy butt--probably because I am.&nbsp; Okay, so this is why I decided to start packing literally right after I finished my rotation and why I decided to go to LA next week--I know that if I have too much time on my hands, I become a TV junkie.&nbsp; Now that I am fully moved back to Sac (more or less), my brain has turned to mush the past two days. I feel more and more miserable every day. I guess there are lots of things I could potentially be doing such as:    Contacting Dr. Fox at MIT  Baking  Reading/Bible study  Hanging out with friends like Ruth, Karyn    Today I went over to Pinecrest and filled out the rental application.&nbsp; I don't really know why, but I'm still don't feel thrilled to be living there.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong--it's a perfectly decent place and it's very affordable, relatively speaking. It has everything that I need for basic living and it's in a very quiet, attractive complex.&nbsp; I guess I had my heart set on living at Cambridge House.&nbsp; I don't regret choosing Pinecrest because I still think it's the most practical decision.&nbsp; As I blogged earlier, I don't really need to live in such luxury, especially since I will only be in Davis for 2 more years. What happened to me? I used to be very comfortable with living simply and now I have a hard time turning down an apartment that's nearly $1,000/month.&nbsp;   Along the same lines, I also noticed that I'm becoming more materialistic. Every time I go to the mall, my eyes get really big and I see a lot of things I want. I'm still conscious of the price and I don't buy anything that's not on sale (with a few exceptions), but I still have that desire to acquire more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really need to be more content with what I have.&nbsp; What&nbsp;bothers me is that I  used  to be content with living simply back in my Berkland days, but I've changed slowly over time. This has nothing to do with vet school or being with B, and more to do with being disconnected from God.   B is going to Tigard tonight. It'll be nice to be on the same time zone again. Funny how basic things like time zones can mean so much to B and myself. I can't believe we're going to see eachother in about 6 days. When I think back to how things were over Memorial Day, our relationship has definately&nbsp;changed.&nbsp; We've been through some hard times together: both of us went through a couple tough finals weeks, I started and finished my rotation (which was quite possibly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life), not to mention setting a record for time spent apart.&nbsp; We've definately been more impatient with eachother lately. It doesn't make me regret being with him, but it does make me concerned about our extended time together in Boston. Things will either be a lot easier, or a lot harder when we see eachother.&nbsp; From how things usually are when we get together, I predict the latter. I bet we will probably argue less overall, but when we do argue, I think it will be more intense than arguing over the phone. It's funny, b/c I say "argue", but we have never actually yelled at eachother. It's more like feelings get hurt and we get annoyed with eachother.   The closer it gets to seeing him, the stronger my feelings seem to get.&nbsp; I'm either really annoyed or really affectionate. Why do I have to be so moody?!? I feel really bad that I've been so unstable lately because it's hard on B.&nbsp; In that sense, I remind myself of Mom, which scares me.&nbsp; Her coldness and moodiness sometimes is what makes her difficult to get along with sometimes and I don't want B to have to put up with that.   I'm really hot. This computer is burning me up. I'm gonna go fill up the sink with cold water and dunk my head in it.&nbsp; Or maybe I'll just eat ice cream.

      Tired...I packed a lot more than I expected today, but it's a good thing.&nbsp; I'm really tired now though. It's good to see my room nearly empty because that means I'm gonna be outta here soon!!  &nbsp;  Today was my first day off clinic and I have to say that I'm really relieved.&nbsp; Maybe later I'll look back on this experience with a little more fondness, but right now, but not-so-good last day of clinic is still fresh in my mind. I still have one more record to write up, and I'm eager to check that off my "to do" list.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today I went to Cambridge House Apartments and left a holding deposit with the management.&nbsp; This place is super nice, and I feel a little guilty for wanting to live in such luxury.&nbsp; $960/month is a LOT of money. In two years, I could have bought a pretty nice car for the amount of money I will have spent on rent. What makes me feel a bit better is that this rent is acutally  discounted   $45  from what I would have paid. Plus, there's only a $100 security deposit that I will most likely get back. Included T1 connection and cable makes the rent a little easier to swallow too. I hate to say this, but I'm actually excited about having a TV again.&nbsp; This means I actually need to buy one though. And if I buy a TV, I need to get a small TV stand or table to put it on... *sigh* Why do things have to cost money? Meem says that the family is planning on making a stop at Ikea tomorrow so maybe I can pick up some things for the new apartment.&nbsp; Part of me wishes I could move in NOW instead of waiting until September, especially since I won't have that much time when I come back from Boston b/c I start school right away. I'm eager to settle in and redecorate. I thin Ben and Cheese will be happier with less animals in the house too. &nbsp; 11 more days until B comes...I keep forgetting that I'm going to LA in a week too!! Yippee!&nbsp; Now I'm glad that I got so much packing done because I really don't&nbsp;have that much time left.

      Just had boba with Karyn and Jon at Old Teahouse.  I saw Dennis there, although I didn't recognize him for a long time. He looks kinda different--paler and with shorter hair than I remember.  I saw him looking at me too so I think he recognized me.  I always feel awkward when I run into Berkland people, and seeing Dennis was no exception. He was with a girl too, so I wonder if he's dating her (secretly). Seeing him there was a bit distracting. I bet he felt awkward too. Just like when I saw Aaron and Roger at Crepeville and we didn't say anything to eachother--not that I expected them to come up to me. I haven't heard from Alison in a long time.  When I called her up to study together, she gave me kind of a lame excuse.  I thought that was strange because she was very eager to study with me just the week before.  I wonder if Alice unni and Susanna SMN told her not to talk to me anymore because they saw me with B at the airport. I wouldn't be at all surprised, especially if they saw us making out in the parking lot. If they really did tell her not to talk to me anymore, they probably don't think I would be a good influence on her. Even so, I think they still care about me though. It's been three years since I've left the church and yet I still think about the five years I spent with them and how much it shaped who I am.   Found out today from Jon and Karyn that Josh is engaged!  Wow, and he's only 22 years old. I heard he proposed to her two weeks ago when she came to visit. He's been dating Tracy for 5 years, though, I guess since the beginning of college.  I heard he bought her a phat diamond ring with 3 stones because she's kind of a "girlie girl".  As if really feminine girls wouldn't settle for anything less than a big engagement ring... I've never met Tracy, but I can say that Josh is mature for someone his age, so I'm happy for them.  Couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy though... It must be hard for them since she's in Arizona and he's here.  I say this like I feel sorry for them, but at least she's in the Western US.   I'm nervous about starting the work week (as usual). Tomorrow will be busy since I will probably pick up 2 appointments. I just want to make it through one more week. It's not that I don't enjoy it, but this rotation has been incredibly draining and stressful.  I hope it will be easier my senior year. All I want to do is to see B and to hang out together. I think his anxiousness to see me is catching on and I'm beginning to feel restless as well.  My heart has been feeling achy lately, even to the point where it's harder to talk to him because I just want to see him. I feel more and more than talking on the phone is so inadequate compared to spending time together. By "spending time", I don't just mean making out, but just going everywhere together like running errands. I think anxiety about work is compounding my anxiousness to see B, so I think I will feel much more content after this week is over. If I'm lucky, I won't have to be on call this weekend since we have 2 new students joining our group. *sigh*   Cheese has been feeling restless too since Ben is gone.  Maybe he's been more affectionate with me b/c he's afraid that I'm going to give him away too if he's not a good boy.  I wonder if they're going to hug when they're reunited next weekend.   My heart literally hurts because I miss B so much. I just want it to be July 28th already. 16 more days...

      Overall, I had a great day today seeing/talking to people at CGBC (except for Jerry). God has made Himself evident so many times throughout the day. Read on...  I got two prayer letters from Mary (going to LA missions) and Wayne & Ruth (Nepal).  Today during service we sent off the Equador team that consists mostly of high schoolers or recent high school grads.  It's good to see people younger and in my age group going off to missions.  When will it be my turn?  Seeing B's mom after service today was an unexpected treat.  I was looking around for her during service, but I didn't see her.  When she found me, I was happy to hear that she was actually looking for me after service.  I think we were both excited to see eachother.  We had a really easy conversation--not awkward at all, which was a blessing. Now I can see why B and his mom are so close--she seems really fun just to hang out and play board games with. Could she be my future mother-in-law?  That would be totally awesome, not only because I would be married to B, but also b/c I can see myself adoring his family.   I talked to Sue quite a bit today.  I'm glad to hear that she was feeling better today. This past week she was near tears several times when she called me at work because of her chronic TMJ pain. She told me when I dropped her off after church that she got a $600 scholarship to pay for her expenses from her trip to Atlanta (which only amounted to ~$300).  I think she can manage to pay the rest, but she wants to do more research about what kind of splints are out there.  I can't believe she didn't tell me about that sooner...not that I'm offended, but that's BIG news! God is totally providing for her financially, which was the only constraint to getting her splint.  She was so down emotionally about being in pain that she was even begging God to "take her".  That kind of talk totally scares me, even though she's told me that she's not suicidal or anything. This new windfall was just what she needed to lift her spirits (and mine). Does God ever fail to provide for our needs? NEVER!  I also chatted briefly with Mary after Sunday School when she gave me her prayer letter.  I asked somewhat fearfully how things were going at home, because I didn't want to stir up bad memories. Instead, she told me that things were going great and she had a really good talk with her mom.  They resolved a lot of misunderstandings about her mom favoring her brother and such. Now her mom is making a much bigger effort to cook for the family and take better care of Mary.  She said that she's even spoiling her! WOW.  That's amazing. This is more evidence that God answers prayers and that He is a God of reconciliation.  B told me that Leon went to church with him today and he said that Leon wants to go with him every Sunday! Not only that, but another student in the 1st year class wants to go too! I think it's really amazing how God brings people to HIMSELF and chooses to involve us, instead of us actively bringing people to God.  Does that makes sense? I think this is great on several different levels: 1) Having people go to church with B is good accountibility and 2) this is spiritually encouraging to B.  Getting sleepy now and it's not even 10am yet.  Being in the sun is draining, or maybe I'm just getting older.

      I just called Jon to see what was up.  I haven't talked to him at all really since Pricilla & Enoch's wedding.  I had a sneaking suspicion that he and Karyn are more than friends by now.  Last time we talked he told me that she was being "friendlier" than usually lately.  She even came ove to his house before the wedding and HE HELPED HER DO HER HAIR.  That seems like something a boyfriend would do, not that I've ever asked B for help with my hair. When I called him he had some high schoolers in the car with him and he sounded tired.    The more I think about it, the more I can't wait until I live by myself.  At first, I felt guilty for wanting to live alone.  Somehow, it seemed selfish and anti-social. Afterall, it was definately unheard of in Berkland that someone would live by themselves.  I guess the concensus was that roommates helps you to know yourself better and teaches you how to love others.  I think this is absolutely true, but does this mean that living by yourself is then selfish? I guess it depends on WHY I want to live by myself. Of course the main reasons are about difficulties with Julie.  Sometimes I wonder if I would have more or less trouble with her if I actually confronted her about the things that bother me--like cleaning up and her sensitivity to noise. Believe me, for the vast majority of the time, communication about what bothers me is the better than stewing in my frustration. This is definately what I believe in the context of my relationship with B, for instance. In Julie's case, I was worried that confronting her would cause her to have hard feelings against me. This has happened when Jenni confronts her about stuff, and now the two of them have a very awkward relationship. I'm also not a very confrontation person at all, so it's hard for me to bring up stuff with people I don't know that well.  It's funny--I've lived with Julie for nearly a year, but I don't feel like I know her an ounce better than day 1. Well, Julie's only going to be living here for another 2 weeks, so I won't have to deal with whether or not to confront her anymore.    The core of the issue is: Do I want to live by myself so I can do what I want without dealing with roomates?  By "deal", I mean "communicate, compromise, and sacrifice." Would only a truely loving person want to work with difficult roommates until a resolution is reached? If this is true, does this mean I'm not loving because I don't really want to work things out with Julie?    It seems like B is getting more and more anxious about seeing me the longer we're apart.  This is proof of how attached to me he is, but I'm also worried that this is distracting him from his studies.  Diligence with regards to school/work is acutally a turn-on.  I guess I like geeky guys (which explains my crush on Toby McGuire and Harry Potter).  Diligence is a sign of self-discipline (delayed gratification), and self-discipline is a sign of maturity. I'm not saying that I think that B is immature.  I also think that focusing more on school and Bible study would make the time go by more easily. How much he misses me is flattering, but it's also good to have a firm grip on one's emotions--control THEM, instead of having emotions control YOU.   More shopping today in Napa Valley.  Wouldn't that be a beautiful place for a wedding? I feel like I'm being drawn in more and more into materialism.  My wardrobe isn't that big for a girl, but that's rapidly changing. I've gotten 8 new tops over a week's time. Isn't that a lot? What's scary, is that window shopping at the mall after eating at Todai's still made me look longingly at some cute skirts I saw in the windows. Also, the thought of moving in to a new place makes me think about going to Ikea and getting a futon for the living room (if Jenni decides to keep hers), lamps, dishware (I'm using Jenni's now), and countless other essential and non-essential household stuff.  I worry about money more than I should sometimes, yet I have no problem laying down big bucks at Bennetton for 4 cute tops that I "must have". Now that I'm dating B, my clothes are getting smaller and tighter--and it's not because I've been gaining weight.  For instance, I tried on the red top I bought last week that is shoulderless on one side and she was like, "just don't wear it to church".  And I bought my first tube top today!  I really like it, but this is the first time I even considered wearing something like that. I think it looks classy and dressy, but still--I'm not used to showing that much skin. I also have this urge to buy cute lingerie.  Not the uncomfortable kind, but the kind that's sexy but something I can also sleep in (assuming that I will acutally be sleeping with clothes on in Boston). That's something B will appreciate though...

      I'm doing everything to keep myself from thinking about getting called into work this morning.  I would MUCH rather PLAN on being at the hospital rather than being a slave to my pager.  This is the same exact reason why I don't like emergency medicine--it's so unpredictable.  This just goes to show that I'm impatient when it comes to uncertainty. If there's something I don't know, I want to know it  now ...like whether or not I need to work today.   Wow, I had a very productive shopping trip with Mom and Meem (M&M) yesterday. I can't wait to show B my new dress.  I hope he likes it... I think it's pretty spiffy--it's a pretty different kind of style with the Hamlin being asymmetrical and all. It makes me feel like a flamenco (sp?) dancer. I also love my new dream shoes. I hope they get a little more comfortable the more I walk in them.  They're just fine when I'm walking on soft surfaces, but they kinda hurt when I'm walking on harder surfaces like pavement. They literally are exactly what I was looking for.  Mom says I sound like a horse when I walk because they make a lot of noise. I hope I made a good decision about the red shirt.  I like the style, but I wish that the red was a deeper color and not so "fire engine-y).  I hope I get a chance to go back and find a few more bras. I like shopping in general, of course, but I like shopping for bras the LEAST. I dunno why--maybe it's because I'm self-conscious about my size. Well, the fact that I got a bra that I liked and fit me well for less than $5 was very encouraging.  Julie told me Thursday night that she's going to be moving out on August 1st.  On one hand, I'm surprised, but on the other, I'm not. I'm surprised because she told me a few months ago that she was planning on staying.  I heard from Jenni that she has moved every year since she got to vet school (that makes 3 times) due to roommate conflicts, and her dad told her that he is not going to move her again. I'm not surprised because I think Julie and Jenni have been having some conflicts lately and I have a feeling that she thinks this place is a dump.  Well, I don't feel bad about the last reason because what does she expect the place to be like if she doesn't lift a finger to clean?!?   Living with Jenni has been pretty easy, although both of us aren't home very much and when we are, we're studying.  But it's nice when we do go out for the occasional lunch together or when we stand around talking in the hallway between our rooms.  She's a nice girl, and I don't want to see her getting hurt by moving in with Scott so soon.  She's hesitant too, even though he wants her to move in. It's nice to see that she is trying to think carefully about this decision rather than diving in head-first.  So, I want her to stay her for her sake.  It would also make it easier if she stayed because then I wouldn't have to deal with finding a new place, moving, and possibly letting down the guy who's going to sublease my room for the summer.   Then again, the idea of living by myself is kind of intriguing.  Ever since Meem moved into her cool place in SF, I've thought how fun it would be to live by myself.  I hope this doesn't make me seem anti-social.  It's just that it's hard right now because I can't talk on the phone to B in my own room, there's a few too many animals running around, and I'm doing more than my fair share of cleaning.  I don't think I would get lonely because I could always go over to Tiffany's place to study or go home to Sac.  Well, I'm ready to accept whatever decision Jenni makes about where she wants to stay and to make my plans accordingly. She said that she's leaning more towards moving in with Scott, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep my eyes open for housing. Now I wish I hadn't deleted all those housing notices that came in through school e-mail.

      Just waiting for B to call me to say goodnight... I'm just about ready to go to bed now too even though it's not even 9:30pm yet.  It feels wierd to not have to go to the VMTH tomorrow b/c I don't have any inpatients. I was thinking I should get a camera so I can snap pics of my patients and keep an album.  Some of them (like Beanie) I end up taking care of for a long time and I get attached.  I don't want to forget any of them. I really do miss Beanie and I think about him periodically throughout the day.  I hope his owners follow through with the treatment--his skin is sloughing quickly and it probably looks horrible by now.  Do you think it's wierd to pray for animals?  I know that they don't go to Heaven, but I also know that God cares about each one.  Afterall, they are part of His creation too and He knows how they suffer too.

      I'm leaving for Boston in 2.5 days.  B and I had a wonderful time during his visit to Sac the past 3 days.  We went to the mall (I got my first bikini), saw Spiderman 2, had dinner at Elephant Bar, went to Todai with M & D, spent time with his PoPo over lunch and at the Asian market, went out to dim sum with his aunts and uncle, and took a walk together.  I felt like we were constantly eating the whole weekend!  Besides my stomach, my heart is full as well.  I had a good time with him.  I'm discovering some "boy habits" that gross me out sometimes like popping zits and blisters, and picking his teeth at the table w/o a toothpick.  That's about it.  Those things I can live with, though.  It probably grosses me out because I'm not used to these boy habits and all boys gross me out to some degree.  Mostly, though, my heart feels heavy.  I love spending time with him, but i have guilt that spoils our time together.  Brandon and I slep together for the first time during his time here.  We had said when we first started dating that we would break up if we ever slept together and now we are facing that deciison.  I brought it up last night after he got back to Tigard.  He didn't seem to be feeling the same kind of guilt as I was, but I guess he hasn't really had time to think about it yet.  I can't bear the thought of not being with him.  I can't imagine us being in Boston together and just being "friends".  I think that would break my heart. I feel pressed by guilt over what we have done and the fear of getting pregnant. I plan on calling the peer counselors tomorrow about whether I should take a "morning after pill" and about birth control options.  But would getting birth control be like giving ourselves permission to have sex?  but knowing how we are together, if I spend time with him alone in his room, history shows that we are likely to get ourselves into trouble.  But why do I fear pregnancy more than I fear God?  I guess right now pregnancy seems like more of a real threat to me. Not that God should be a threat--I should say that I fear the consequences of pregnancy more than I fear God's judgement.  If it's pregnancy that I fear, then putting myself on birth control will eliminate that fear.  But if it's God that I fear, that will eliminate the sex (spiritual birth control).  So in a way, whether or not to start the Pill is like choosing who will be my master.  Choose the pill and sex will be my motivating factor.   I guess that leaves us with the decision of "what next"? We talked last night about following through with our committment to break up if we slept together.  It seemed like B was prepared and willing to go through with it if I throught that was best.  He was concerned with my level of guilt and was very considerate of what I wanted to do.  He didn't try to convince me to think one way or another.  Neither of us had any answers, and that's where things stand now.  The only thing that both of us knows for sure is that we like eachother and want to be together.  It seems like the only thing that would keep us from having sex would be to break up--but neither of us want to do that.  I really want the decision of whether or not to be on birth control to be a decision that  both  of us make.  I wish he were here to attend the counseling class together.
