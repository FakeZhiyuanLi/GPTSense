      Today I got this email.
 To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages, But this is 
from my 
good friend Pearlas Sandborn and she really is an attorney.

If she says that this will work - It will work. After all, What have 
you got 
to lose? SORRY EVERYBODY.. JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! I'm an 
attorney, 
And I know the law. This thing is for real. Rest assured AOL and Intel 
will 
follow through with their promises for fear of facing a 
multimillion-dollar 
class action suit similar to the one filed by PepsiCo against General 
Electric not too long ago.

Dear Friends; Please do not take this for a junk letter. Bill Gates 
sharing 
his fortune. If you ignore this, You will repent later. Microsoft and 
AOL 
are now the largest Internet companies and in an effort to make sure 
that 
Internet Explorer remains the most widely used program, Microsoft and 
AOL 
are running an e-mail beta test.

When you forward this e-mail to friends, Microsoft can and will track 
it ( 
If you are a Microsoft Windows user)  For a two weeks time period.

For every person that you forward this e-mail to, Microsoft will pay 
you 
$245.00 For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, 
Microsoft 
will pay you $243.00 and for every third person that receives it, You 
will 
be paid $241.00. Within two weeks, Microsoft will contact you for your 
address and then send you a check.

Regards. Charles S Bailey General Manager Field Operations
1-800-842-2332 Ext. 1085 or 904-1085 or RNX
292-1085 Charles_Bailey@csx.com Charles_bailey@csx.com


I thought this was a scam myself, But two weeks after receiving this 
e-mail 
and forwarding it on. Microsoft contacted me for my address and 
withindays, 
I receive a check for $24,800.00. You need to respond before the beta 
testing is over. If anyone can affoard this, Bill gates is the man.

It's all marketing expense to him. Please forward this to as many 
people as 
possible. You are bound to get at least $10,000.00. We're not going to 
help 
them out with their e-mail beta test without getting a little something 
for 
our time. My brother's girlfriend got in on this a few months ago. When 
i 
went to visit him for the Baylor/UT game. She showed me her check. It 
was 
for the sum of $4,324.44 and was stamped "Paid in full"

Like i said before, I know the law, and this is for real.

Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them the 
largest 
Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL remains the most 
widely 
used program, Intel and AOL are running an e-mail beta test.

When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will track it( 
if you 
are a Microsoft Windows user)for a two week time period.

TRy it; What have you got to lose
