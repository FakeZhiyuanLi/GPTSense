      haha most of you will be jealous, that's a given.  I purchased today "Inspiration" by William Hung! yay singing hits such as the awesomely sung "She Bangs", "I believe I can fly", "Hotel California", and "Y.M.C.A.".  It's awesome and I recommend you and your friends to go rush out and get this wonderful CD.  I got it for eight bucks, which is a deal!  Well anyways enough about Will Hung.  Fourth of July is coming up and everyone will be celebrating our wonderful country with blowing things up as always haha it's fun we all know it is (blowing things up).  I'll be doing what I done last year, boozing it up with my grandma.  I know how sad that sounds haha.  No, haha it's a lot of fun my grandparents come over and my grandma and I "take shots" (sips) of Smirnoff Ice so I won't be doing any DDing this year haha anyways hope you all have fun this Fourth of July!

      Cal. State Fullerton of course!" you might of heard Cal. State Fullerton fans say as they saw their team win the final game of the three game series which was played this Saturday (CSF:  6, UT:  4) and Sunday (CSF:  3, UT: 2).  Jason Windsor, more than likely will be announced as the CWS Most Outstanding Player Award, did an excellent job for his CSF team getting two complete games and one save.  What lost it for Texas this year was their bullpen.  One of the best in the game, Texas' bullpen didn't pull threw, as former CWS Most Outstanding Player Award winner and A's prospect, Houston Street and the rest of his bullpen, simply didn't "git 'er done".  Street not new to the save chances with 12 saves leading the big 12, blew two saves in the CWS.  I had CSF winning it all after I watched them beat USC in the first round.  Go CSF!

      Howdy all, I'm sitting here and haven't got too much to do not really talking to anyone right now for they are away so I thought I'd update the good ole website.  Da Hogs lost to Arizona on Father's day 7-2, which wasn't as bad as our lose to texas, which was 13-2.  We haven't been to the College World Series in a long time so it was pretty cool for the hogs to make it as far as they did, they represented us well.  Perhaps even more so next year.  Well anyways I'm gonna have a final update on my sub-profile this shut that sucker down :'( all well I suppose I enjoy updating this website more than I do a silly sub-profile all the time, it will be better to come and look at this 10 years later than the sub-profile.  Nonetheless, to something I do on my sub-profile, to the events! Current Events (stolen from da bunny)  Where: "Big Sur"!  Time: 6:00!  What's new?:  This website!  Song of the month: "Every night's another story" by The Early November Music on? You bet'cha If Yes, what song?: "Big Sur" by The Thrills  What song do I wish was on: none really Talking to:  LBH, Tom, kinda da bunny kinda not, and Joe. Hungry?: Yeah, I kinda am. For what?: Anything I normally eat What I'd rather be doing:  Not too much Chewing Gum?: Nope! Bye?: I'm afraid so Mood: Really good homes

           You may all know that our beloved Diamond Hogs are in the biggest tournament for college baseball, the college world series.  The college world series is a huge event to all college baseball fans.  Everyone gets to "roll out" to Omaha Nebraska to watch his or her team compete for the championship if their team was fortunate enough to make it into the 64 team tournament.  The tournament is like march madness and the NCAA bracket, but when they narrow it down to 8 teams, it becomes double elimination.       Nonetheless, the hogs made it to become one of the eight teams in the finals.  They matched up against number one Texas.  Texas is a favorite to win the whole thing, and we lost badly 13-2.  So we drop down to the losers bracket and play Arizona tomorrow, Father's day.  The hogs haven't been to the CWS in 15 years so tune in Sunday at 1 ESPN to root on our hogs, we'll need the support.

       urlLink    It looks even better on the net haha.I took my permit test on April 27th of this year and now today, June 16th, I got to take my driving part of the test and passed with flying colors.  I'm proud.  Just did one thing wrong, but it was just a little minor thing.  Nothing to make me fail the thing.  It was extremely easy (not hatein' on anyone who has failed it in the past).  I found out it isn't as hard as you would imagine.  If you haven't gone to take yours in fear of not passing go take it crazy hobo.  I haven't got my hard copy licience yet, but tomorrow I will and I'll update the site with a picture of it and all since I didn't have a picture to publish today.  Picked up the forms I need for my hardship so I'll be able to drive to school this year so that will be cool.  Go me!  This is about I'll I've got to say for today, 'till tomorrow! &nbsp; urlLink

      I recently attended the VBHS journalism three camp along with fellow members such as da bunny and many more (since he is the only one on the staff that will more than likely ever read this).  I'd say it was a lot of fun, didn't learn too much, but I had a wonderful time.  Prank calling, dumping ice out beside people's doors and running away very quickly.  A lot of fun.  The camp took place on June 7th at 7:30 when we set off for Russilville.  The trip there was a lot of fun, we kinda got lost on the way and G saw us and kinda gave us a funny look as if we didn't know where we were going so on the way to the event while passing G I got a piece of paper from da bunny I wrote "We know where we are going" which was extremely funny at the time.  The food was great, meet new awesome people, had fun, what more can you ask for?  Well, perhaps it being free would of been extra cool but I didn't mind the costs.  You don't really have much say when you are a newbie to journalism, but I don't mind plus you gotta just get 'er done.  I just want to do the sports anyways they can do the rest for all I care.  Well that was the high light of my summer so I shall stay in my room for the rest of the summer now I suppose, I'll see you guys around town.

      Howdy all, once again I'm updating just for the second time and nothing much is new except the little fact...SCHOOLS OUT! yay haha I'm glad, this year wasn't too bad tho I had a lot of fun but had some low times as well.  I'll be optimistic and say this year was a successful one at that.  Nonetheless, Journalism trip is coming up soon on the 7th of this month so that will be a lot of fun.  Seeing some friends and Mrs. Garcia will be pretty fun and I've been stuck at home most of the time so yay get out of the house and away from it all.  Found some good songs over the past few days so been rocking to those haha well I'm running out of things to say and I haven't even put this on my profile yet but I'll do so soon enough I suppose nonetheless, I'll see you around town.

      I went out with some friends to Blakemore for the "Battle on the Border" show which was really, really cool.  If you didn't get the memo about this wonderful competition, the event is a band competition where they are judged in several categories based on their performance.  Anyways, the show was really cool.  Went with some friends and had a really good time.  When I first stepped in Blakemore my first thought was "can't wait for football".  The field looked really nice and I can't wait for football to start up.  The only reason I'm looking forward to school is for the sports.  I'm on the journalism staff and newspaper staff so perhaps this will be my excuse to my parents so I can drive to the away games.  That's if I can drive...haven't got my hardship thing in the mail but at this point in time I didn't really expect it back.  Well, I'm going to go see a movie this Saturday with some friends.  The movie is Village.  Looks pretty scary but I'll have a review for you and a rating.  Until then, I'm out!

      Howdy all.  July is only but days away from ending so it's that time again for the monthly "what's going on?" update.  July was a pretty good month expect for the fact that school is approaching us every so quickly.  We get to go get our schedules the 11th of August so school is getting close to starting again.  I haven't been shopping yet so I'm a little behind.  But all well still got some time to do all my shopping to look stylin' for the year.  Anyways, thought of an idea the other day where viewers, such as yourself, would send me e-mails if you had a question of opinion and I would answer them and call it "Viewer mail" or something so if you've got a question send it over to  urlLink HaroldWM2002@yahoo.com  anyways to the events!    Current Events (stolen from da bunny)  Where: "New York, New York"  Time: 2 mins past 3  What's new?: School is about to start aww :'/  Song of the month: Going old school on you, going with "Come fly with me" by Jamie Cullum.&nbsp; Old school song but new school singer.  Music on? You bet'cha  If Yes, what song?: "Same to you" by Hidden in&nbsp;Plain View&nbsp;  What song do I wish was on: perhaps "A Decade Under the Influence" by Taking Back Sunday  Talking to: Nobody what so ever just signed on-line  Hungry?: I am kinda...  For what?: perhaps pizza  What I'd rather be doing: talking to Lindsay or playing MVP baseball 2004  How are the Red Sox going?!:&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; They took 2 of 3 from the Skankies recently.  Any up coming events?:&nbsp; School starting :'(  Bye?:&nbsp; Yup for now anyways, but you can send an e-mail if that makes you feel better haha  Mood:&nbsp; Wonderful

      My right and/or left hand man, Da bunny as you may know him, is not going to be attending VBHS this year :'( so I thought it would be a nice thing to have a post dedicated to da bunny.&nbsp; Da bunny is going off to Arkansas School of Math and Science.&nbsp; If you haven't heard of such a High School it's for really smart people.&nbsp; Da bunny was first in 10th grade class so he is packing up shop and is gonna go to that High School.&nbsp; Everyone that knows da bunny wishes him the best of luck in life.&nbsp; Post a comment if you want to comment about da bunny leaving.

      Yay, I thought I was be unable to drive to school this year but I sent in my hardship form earlier than I thought I would, which was yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got all five letters gathered and sent it in.&nbsp; So I'm crossing my fingers that I'll be able to get my hardship back in time and be able to drive to school.&nbsp; Now that I'm 16, it's really gay I can't drive.&nbsp; If I could drive perhaps I'd get a job.&nbsp; Buy some cool/stylin' clothes or something like that.&nbsp; All well stupid Arkansas driving laws!&nbsp; That's all I've got to rant about for now, take it easy all.

      Yesterday was my birthday which went quite well.&nbsp; I got an Ipod, NCAA Football 2005, and some memory to add to my laptop so it's running subba smooth.&nbsp; Didn't have a big party or anything for turning 16.&nbsp; Just had my grandparents over, an uncle, and Tom.&nbsp; Got a big ole Spongebob Square Pants cake, and that was really cool.&nbsp; Well, school is coming up really soon just weeks away now so our summers are about to end.&nbsp; I didn't get to do much at all if anything what so ever.&nbsp; But there is always next year.&nbsp; Hope you enjoyed your summer and enjoy the last bit of it.&nbsp; I'm out.

      Well, it's July 9th, 2004 and that means:  my birthday is coming up soon, Major League Baseball All-Star game and Home Run Derby are coming up soon, and school is getting ever so closer to starting.  Two out of three ain't bad.  It's a week away from my birthday today and I hope I'll be doing something.  I suppose I could go to Chuck"E"cheese!  Nobody is too old for that place.  Who knew cheap toys were so sought after!?  Or perhaps I could just stay home and do nothing what so ever or something in between.  I dunno what I want...perhaps an Ipod mini or an upgrade on my laptop's graphics card.  Can't go wrong with either I suppose.  DVDs are always good as well.  Recently I've found an awesome game.  Perhaps you've played it.  Scrabble!  I really like that game.  If you haven't played it and like word games you might wanna give it a shot.  Our neighborhood plays it a lot so it's pretty cool to get together and play a game of scrabble.  Well I suppose that's all I've got to say, I'm out.

      Fourth of July has came and gone along with a lot of fire works along with it.  Some people like to have the big cook outs and invite the whole neighborhood.  Some like to watch the Mayors fire work show.  Either way you celebrate our great nations birthday seems to be always a fun time at least.  I did what I always do for fourth of July, which is have the grandparents over and the rest of the family have a cook out, watch TV, and swim.  It's always pretty funny and it's always good to get the family all together.  Well, I suppose that's all I've got to say about my fourth of July hope you had a wonderful one as I did.

      Well, this week has been the best all summer by far.  Went bowling with friends Tuesday, starting going out with my hobo, aka LBH aka B-Hines aka Cowgirl aka scubba gooba etc.  Thursday da bunny and Jeremy came by and we had some fun.  Playing some basketball and chillin' at the grip.  It was a lot of fun.  Then Friday I went to da bunny/Emily's farewell party and that was pretty cool.  Playing Halo at an event, can't get much better.  It was quite fun.  Then today I went up to Springdale because my parents are crazy and wanted to go up there.  So I went up there and while there read a magazine I bought about the upcoming NFL football year.  I'm ready for my fantasy football draft I think.  Got a greatest hits of the Beatles because I don't own one.  So listened to that and read my magazine pretty much.  Found a Dairy Queen too been looking for one of those because I see their commercials all the time when I watch da sox games on my laptop.  Got myself a coffee drink and mmm...mmm good stuff.  Well, I get my schedule Wednesday so I suppose I'll post that.  I'm out!

      I went bowling yesterday night at Mid Land bowl and it was extremely fun!  Went with a lot of friends who include:  LBH, da Bunny, Chaz, and Cliff.  There was eight of us in total and it was a lot of fun.  I'm a pretty good bowler and I wasn't doing very well the first game.  Found out I was a little off in my deliverer and was a little off from where I needed to start.  So the first game I scored a 61, which was rather awful.  But next game I made the adjustment and bowled a 120, yay!  It isn't my highest score tho.  I believe my highest score is some where near 142.  I almost got a turkey, and that was pretty awesome.  After spending that night with the most awesome person in the world, aka Lindsay Hines, I went home called her up and asked her out so yay we are going out now.  So that's extremely awesome, so life is awesome!  Hope yours is too!

      Yesterday, as some may have known, was the Major League Baseball trading deadline and there were some block buster trades.  The one that affects da sox the most would have to be shipping away Nomar Garciaparra in a four team trade getting in return first basemen Doug Mientkiewicz and to take Nomar's spot on the field, Orlando Cabrera.  Da sox defence has been killing them as of late and General Mangager Theo Epstein thought that it would be wise to ship Nomar and his contract that ended at the end of the season somewhere else since he already rejected at the start of the season an extenstion to his contract.  Da sox also aquired a speedy outfield by the name of Dave Roberts who has thirty-three steals in thirty-four trys, not bad.  The Sox will have little or no problems with out Nomar in the lineup and look ready to win the World Series!
