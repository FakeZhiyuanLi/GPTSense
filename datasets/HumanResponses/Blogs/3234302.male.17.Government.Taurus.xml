       We all want President Bush out, but why put John Kerry in?  That defeats the purpose.  Let's finally elect an independent.  Someone who isn't loyal to corporations or Skull & Bones.  If you'd like to help with the New Mexico for Nader movement, comment here.

       This Blog is for our Good Deed Pay it Forward project that has come out of our  urlLink Gmail chain blog .   The Rules:  1.  When a good deed is done to you and you are asked to Pay it Forward (or you receive a Gmail Invite) you will be obligated to Pay it Forward 3-fold.   2.  The Good Deed can be anything that helps anyone in anyway, the more personal the better.  Simply tell them to Pay it Forward, explain the rules and share this link if you'd like. 3.  At least two of your good deeds must be on a level personal enough that someone will Pay it Forward.  Charitible donations are fine, but realize that these most often will not keep the Pay it Forward chain going. 4.  Comment to the post below what your deeds were.  We'll post "Good-doers" on the right after they successfully complete their three deeds.     Below you will find the Post for commenting on your good deeds. Further down you'll find our FAQs.

       Comment here if you have a question not answered in our FAQ.    How do I get Gmail?  This isn't the blog for getting Gmail, this is the Blog for paying it forward after someone was kind enough to give you Gmail.   urlLink Click here  to give your Gmail request.   Do I have to get Gmail to be a part of this?  No, you can simply do it because you want to or because someone else did something kind to you.  I started this for all the people who have received Gmail through Melissa's or my blogs and I'm asking them to Pay it Forward.   Is a donation to charity a good deed? Yes it is.  But unless you are able to get someone to Pay it Forward with your donation, then it won't help our efforts too much.  You may use one good deed on doing something good that will not be able to be paid forward.   Can I lie in my comments?  Well, I suppose.  I can't stop you, but it would be very, very rude of you.  We're trying to actually get people to do some good and be grateful to the good they received, whether it be a Gmail invite or something else.  Please don't lie just to get your name on the "Good-doers" list.   Must I only do 3 good deeds?  No, you can do as many as you'd like.  We'd all love you to do more than three.  Three is our mandatory amount to receive status as a "Good-doers".   Why do we need a Blog for this?  No reason, but why not?  The Gmail chain was started on a blog, so it would make sense to at least have a Blog HQ for this idea.

      They're aren't many and the few that exsist aren't as flambouant as the Liberal Hollywood Celebrities.  But I decided to make a Blog to reveal which celebrities are Right-wingers, Conservative and/or Republicans.  Here is a list I have compiled and I'll keep adding to it.  Please send in your comments if you have any information for me:  Clint Eastwood - Former Republican Mayor of Carmel  Arnold Schwarzenegger - Current Republican Governor of California, moderate Toby Keith - Uncertain, but he attacked the Dixie Chick's anti-Bush comment.

       We are the SPAM BOOTERS and our mission is to stop spam by booting out spammers in chat rooms.  We are also open to other ideas.  We're in an infant stage right now and just getting started.  Anything we can do to harm spammers we will.  If you have ideas, comment them here.  I'll post a list of spammers soon.    What we do mainly: We boot Yahoo Chatroom Spammers.  If you are annoying and use big text we'll probably boot you too.  Before all bootings we give people a good chewing out and when they come back, do it again and boot them again.  Hopefully we'll teach people some sort of ethics regarding chatrooms.
