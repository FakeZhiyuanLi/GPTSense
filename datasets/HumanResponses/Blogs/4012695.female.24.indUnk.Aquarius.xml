       Late shift again...    &nbsp;  This week was crappy. I was ill (still am, sorta) and spent 2 days in bed.   Of course the weather is just beautiful now. D'oh.   Then yesterday, my first day "out" again, a bee stung me! In the hollow of my knee.&nbsp;I was wearing long trousers and have no clue whatsoever how the damn thing got in there. But it did, and stung me and it hurts like sh*t. Even today.   Aww, poor me! *insert self-pity*    &nbsp;  Oh by the way, the esoteric therapist woman was successful! She cured my jealousy. Or at least she brought me on the right way. I just have to stick to it from now on... And I now know why I'm being so bitchy all the time. Only she calls it "self-righteous indignation"&nbsp;lol I find that so cool! Sounds impressive :)    &nbsp;  My friend A is so lucky, she just got a really cool job in the fashion business and is visiting a fair next week. I'm so happy for her. Her education was pure horror and she just finished it after 3 years. And now such a good job! Yay!    &nbsp;  Last monday I went to the Sneak Preview and they showed "Cabin Fever". That is so the lousiest movie EVER it is unbelievable. Complete crap!   Only good thing was a pretty actress named Cerina Vincent. But seeing her shaving off her skin in the movie was... well... less pretty.   Don't watch that movie! Or at least don't pay for it. Bad movie. Bad!    &nbsp;  I gotta do late shift again tomorrow so I'll probably post again then.    &nbsp;  xxx

       My first blog post! Yay me!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Hello world!    I guess&nbsp;won't write down certain things here as I would do in a private diary but most likely I&nbsp; could  do so because no-one's ever going to read this anyway... lol... strange thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Weather report: Today is a really hot, thundery & oppressive day. This summer sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   My state:Bored (hey, after all that's why I'm here), with a little headache and having left&nbsp;~2&nbsp;hours of late-shift. Yawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After work me&nbsp;&&nbsp;M (my boyfriend) are going to a fellow student's party and I hope it's gonna be good!&nbsp;    Tomorrow I'm going to see a kinda esoteric "therapist" with my dad for the second time. First time was nice but I can't tell if it's doing anything yet. I don't have serious problems because of which I'm seeing this woman. Just being curious. A, a friend of mine, is very much into esoterism and I thought: why not give it a try? I'm always trying to be an open-minded person..&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Last tuesday I watched Shrek 2 - that movie is soooo hilarious,&nbsp;I loved it! Puss-in-Boots totally cracked me up!So everybody go&nbsp;see it, if you haven't done yet. And watch the credits!&nbsp;     That's it for now.

       This day started early (after some 5 hours of sleep)!   At 7.20am the chimney sweep came! I was like wtf - it's bloody  summer !?   After that, my b/f had to call the firedepartment because we ran out of water at the restaurant. There's only a well there and it ran dry because of the heat. And they call that civilization??   By then it wasn't worthwhile to go back to sleep again, so I got up much earlier than planned and now I'm waiting for the time to passsssss....    Well actually I have quite something to do workwise today. I hope I can leave for 2 hrs or so at 7/8pm. Yeah. Now I have to go to the datacenter and make my Colorado-people happy ;) i.e.: execute their work orders.  xxx

       Too much work!      I don't know what's going on. The restaurant is swarming with people! They come for lunch, sit down in the heat and sun and eat huge meals with meat and all. I don't get it. It's too hot to even  think  of food... but obviously that's only me.   Whatever, we had a lot to do this week.   And now - guess what - I'm doing late-shift again. That is, today, tomorrow and saturday.   So double work for me - helping in the restaurant plus my "regular" job.   I'm tired! And I still have my sniffles.      Besides that everything is fine.   I'm actually a bit excited! On tuesday   M called his host family in Iowa because his host dad was celebrating his birthday. And out of the blue M asked if they were ok with us coming over for 2 or 3 weeks around Christmas!   He never even suggested that to  me ! But I'd be soooo happy to go!   I've never been to the US and so want to go there!   The last weeks I was a little bit disappointed because we don't have time to go on holiday this summer. But if we should really go to Iowa in the winter instead that'd be one hell of a compensation! Woohoo! Cross ur fingers for me!      Yesterday I read in a magazine that they are developping a method of forming breasts out of tummy-fat. How cool is that - getting rid of ur fat and getting larger breasts at the same time! Pay one, get two. Lol.      So that's it for today.      xxx
