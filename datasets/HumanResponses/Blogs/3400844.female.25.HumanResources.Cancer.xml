      I don't think I've cried this much or this hard ever. Ok stress...umm not a good thing. It's more physically taxing than a damn work out. My God I love her so  much. I've been beating myself up for the past few days. What they say is true, you are your worst critic. I had was having thoughts of not living anymore. I take pain that seriously. I probably need some professional help. There are some things I need to get under control. Now my mom knows. My stomach is all fucked up behind that. I've never been good at handling stress. Normally I just internalize it and it makes me lose my hair! My girl told me to always trust your gut. It's never wrong. Thank you God. It's only Wednesday!I need for it to be Friday! I am anxious to get to Detroit! It feels like I haven't seen Steph in months, instead of just 2 weeks. My poor sister is now going through the whole morning sickness thing. I've given her some sites to check out that can help her. If I had the money I would get her these sea bands. They are supposed to help with nausea and morning sickness. I have to admit that I am getting rather excited about this baby. I admit I was skeptical, but I am happy for her now. Ugh...I have to get my thoughts off my mom...hearing her sob was too much. Lord please help us through this. I know she is hurt and disappointed but this is me. She's never going to like all the parts of my life, but she's going to have to try. I am still the same Jana on the inside...I think.

      Hey beautiful girl	 I just fell in love with your smile You have the mouth of one God’s most angelic creatures The instant the corners of your mouth turn… I melt…I fall under the sweet rapture of you Hey beautiful girl The ember color of you eyes pierced through my heart I long to wonder what do those eyes see Where have those eyes been? Who has fallen in love with your eyes? How many tears of pain flooded those beautiful eyes? How many were manifested by me? Hey beautiful girl You’ve possessed me with your mind Speaking volumes of what you know What you felt What you need What you want What you are…a beautiful girl Hey beautiful girl You infected me with your laugh, your humor, the center of you A child in your soul A free spirit A loving heart A laugh that warms the center of my being every time it rings out Keep laughing beautiful girl Hey beautiful girl Can I love you? Can I kiss your face every morning?	 Can I wipe the tears when they fall?	 Can I find my way to your soul?		 Can I lie in your arms and make your heart my home? Hey beautiful girl…I love you.

      Imagine a day without air, a day without lights, a day without the love of your life. I've had one of those days...Lord see me through...you know people always remark people always want the people who treat them like shit and they shit on the people who treat them good. What is the theory with that? Man I love my girl like nothing else in this world, and I've managed to break her heart and trust on more than on occasion about the same thing. It's crazy because what I've done to her is not characteristic of me at all. I've gone to some bad lengths to make sure I never lose her and I've been selfish...so selfish. If God lets her come back to me...if she can love me the same again, if she can look at me the same again, Lord knows I'll uplift that woman and love her so hard until I am physically or mentally unable to. I wonder what the accurate definition of obsession is? I think I'm borderline obsessed with her. Literally almost my every waking, available thought is of her. What she's doing, is she smiling, what is she seeing at each moment.  What does she smell like, what is she thinking, what is she touching, who is falling in love with her smile? It's a wonder that I can get ANYTHING done. Man If I mess around a win the lottery, oh my God, I would be no good. I'd spend my days in love with her...doing anything and everything for her...I'm feeling inspired.

      I am coming to you humbly and remorsefully. I have to begin by thanking you for allowing me to take another breath and begin a new day that was never foreseen or even promised to me. I thank you for your constant blessings and your mercy. You love me and bless me when I know I'm not worthy. You know me, truly know me and my heart and love you me still. I love you Lord. You have given me a healthy body, a sound mind and an ability to love everyone as unselfishly as you love me, and I am thankful. Truly thankful. I have taken you gifts and blessings and taken them for granted. Lord repair my heart, come into my heart and bring me closer to you. I have lost my way. I am stubborn and selfish and I lose site of the fact that nothing superficial in the world matters. Nothing matters except that I live my life in a matter that is right with you. You have blessed with a family that loves me despite of me...and I am thankful. You have blessed me with friends who love despite of me...and I thank you. Lord you gave me one of the greatest gifts, you gave me a love that was so pure, so real and it was based in you. Blessed by you. Again, I lost my way and saw only my own self needs and blocked my blessing. I saw the possibility of a life with Stephanie, all in a attempt to not fill my heart and spirit with hate. To forgive others as you often forgive me. I didn't give love a chance to do just that...to love. Lord, I've never known love like this, besides my family and friends. Lord she is hurting...she is hurting because of me. One of your strong followers and believers, I have hurt her. Who am I? Lord forgive me, lord please open her heart so she can try to forgive me also. I have loved her with everything you given me and more. I am thankful for that. Lord take away her pain and touch her with your gentle hand. If it is in your will, please don't take her from me. I can love your child the way you love us all, without thought or hesitation. I am human and often fall short, in every way. Lord pick me up, show me where I need to be. Heal my heart, touch my spirit. I am so very sorry. you see my heart, and what is there and what is true, I ask that you show her what you see. my actions are not excusable, but my love for your child is undeniable. I don't feel worthy to receive one more blessing you from you, but Lord forgive me. Help me to forgive myself. I have gotten off the track in which you have made for me. Touch me...love me...I need you Lord. I love you Lord. how can you love me and I am so flawed. I will sin again, I will fall off course again and I know that even then you will love me. Thank you Lord. Thank you, you are my savior, you are my answer, you are my friend when I have none, my mother, my father, my doctor, my counselor. I am thank you. I truly thank. I'm shedding tears now because you love me despite of how often I fall short. Thank you God. Thank you God. Thank you God. I thank you for you blessings, and mercy on me. I thank you. I thank you. Amen.

      Today I woke up like most days...talking to my baby...life is beautiful...She has the wonderful idea that is going to change the world. Well at least some part of the US! I am so proud of her. She never ceases to amaze me...I've done it again...I've put myself in a damn bind and from the looks of it I can't be there for her birthday and I hate that shit. I see why people do crazy shit for money and love. I have to figure something out. I need to be there for her birthday. I know she gets flustered with me and my money situation but she has to know I don't like being like this. I do have a problem going out to eat all the time, but I've gotten better. When she came I didn't want her to worry about anything but enjoying her time in the South...I love her so much...she is the like the air I breathe. Have you ever loved like that? The shit is deep...what to do today...I think I might head to the mall with my best friend, but I really want to stay in bed and talk to Steph. I sound so pathetic. But I don't want to share her with the world...she is that wonderful. I'm too jealous. I longed for the weekend and now it's here and I still don't wanna do shit. I seriously need to hit up that damn gym. My hips are SCREAMING for some attention! Well I'm out...I just needed a quick outlet!!! Ciao.

That's good that means exactly one week til I'm in the Motor City with my baby!! I love you!! You have the most beautiful, generous spirit that I know...both of you...Steph/Stephanie...damn Gemini! Baby those 2 pieces of chocolate cake keep haunting my mind...they were sooo good. You know I keep looking forward to 5, but what I am rushing home too...besides my baby and pookie doo. I have to make it to the gym tomorrow morning. I am such a slacker. I really need to pray for some endurance and tenacity, because I don't have it. I am really loving this whole blog thing. All my bidness on the www! You can't beat that. My neck is killing me...ok am I complaining or what? I don't give 2 shits...20 mins and counting...I'd like to drop by a happy hour..that is too many black folks for my liking...standing around acting snotty as hell for NO reason...bitch you ain't cute...nigga you ain't fly!! Ugh...damnit let it be 5!

I know I need to get in the damn bed so I can make this 5:45 am cardio class in the morning. I have no motivation...I keep thinking I need to do some more shoots but I am so far from where I need to be. I need some self control and some damn discipline. I've always lacked that. I am getting grumpy and restless and All I want to do is lay with my boo...UGHHHHHH!!! Damn Eve for cursing me with PMS and cramps! This shit makes me an ugly woman...baby please talk to me...I love you...I miss you...I wish people could get past their bullshit and see love for what it really is...when they do they will see the most beautiful love...man it is truly amazing...

      Well...this is the first post of many I hope. I am so bad about keeping up with journals and diaries...I have so many that I started and now there are nothing but blank pages...I have to work on seeing things through. This is the perfect way for me to pass the time before it's 5. I know they don't pay me for this but...when you are a worker bee like me, you are left with a lot of free time!!! This is going to be the longest hour known to man. I can't wait to talk to my baby in an hour. I am so in love it makes not sense to me...love maybe taking me to Detroit... A southern belle in Motor City...crazier things have happened. I just found out my best friend is pregnant. I'm trying to muster up some happiness for her, but this is not the ideal situation for her to bring an innocent baby in...I need to get past my feelings about the dude and be happy...Chandler Washington is on the way. It makes me look forward to own my baby...McKenzie Brooklyn Gray...isn't that hot!!?? Of course it is! it came from Moi! I am so glad tomorrow is Friday...that means I have one week until I am with my love...2 weeks is torture...how have I made it this long? Love is some beautiful potent shit...love can heal you or hurt you...It's very powerful...it must be handled in a delicate fashion. Or it can be gone before you know it. Well I'm about to "work" this last hour out...Ciao...

      Damn this is the wettest summer ever. I know by the time August comes around people will be begging for the weather to cool off and rain. So thank God for the much needed rain. Well it's offically offical, I am moving to Detroit. Me in the motor city, who would have thought it. Everything is in place except me telling my job. I never have been able to give my resignation. And here...I've only been here for 3 months. I have such an easy job...little supervision...my day goes however I plan it. But I am very excited to go be with my sweetie...That's a definite trade off I think. It's almost my birthday and I am very happy about that...I'll be 25...one quarter of a century...DAMN I AM OLD!!! Where has all the time gone? Wasting it on my damn couch. That's a damn shame. Well I am just rambling now...lemme get some work done...CIAO.

      And with the way my stomach is acting I feel like a whole shade of forest green...It's not a good afternoon. You the more I live on this earth, the more I see that everything is balanced out. Any extreme has a direct opposite of it...feelings, colors, lights...everything...therefore I am starting to see that when things are great with my baby they are FABULOUS...when they aren't they just aren't...we are dealing with distance, PMS...the works...imagine that the one person who you love effortlessly lets it be known that loving you is this difficult chore...a "battle" to be exact...I can't knock anyone and their feelings but how is that supposed to make me feel? I'm at a point in my life where I am exposed to more of myself everyday. And one of the hardest things in life is to know who you TRULY are...the good and the bad. Shit, it's not looking so good. And in the midst of this uncertainty, I am about to uproot my life, turn it around for the person that it takes no effort to love. I love them like I breath...it's involuntary and it can't be controlled. When I stop breathing, I'll stop loving her. What happened to simpler times...the biggest concern was who were you going to copy your homework after? Why do I love like this...I truly feel that I give unconditional love...there is nothing I can even think of that would make me not love that girl...not cheating, not lying...no one is perfect. People make mistakes that's a given, but not everyone can love each other the way we do...I know that's rare...how I can I let the consequences of someone being human get in the way of benefits of finding your soul mate? I am scared that my mistakes will always haunt me and no one can forgive in the same manner as me. I'm going to pay forever. No matter how strong, deep and hard that I love her. There is no one else for me. I feel like a child that needs to be weaned off of her mother when she is around. I want to breath her air, I want to be the focal point of her eyes. All the time...she consumes my ever waking thought. It scares me and then it soothes me. I have to have her in some form. I have never been in love like this and I scared to death of losing it and her. How could I go on after a love like that? I am not a cheater, I am not a liar. My heart is good. I've made mistakes...But some I did right... I loved her.

      Once again it's Friday. This was a short week. I spent the early part of it in Detroit with Steph!!! I didn't want to leave! It was so nice...not what I expected at all. I love the suburb that she lives in. I got to meet her mom and sister and more of her friends. It was very nice. I am so bored at work and it's only 9:00. That means it's going to be a long a day. You know I bitched about having a new job and now I have one and I want another one. I think I'm selling myself short. I don't go for things where I know I have the potential to fail. I shouldn't be like that. All the good jobs are challenging and they make money. I have been here 2 months and I've already mastered this job. What does that say about me and this job? I hope that when I move to Detroit things can be different. Moving to Detroit...I am still in shock. I hope I'm ready. This is going to be a whole new world for me. I'm so worried about how to break this to my mom and brother. But I have to do what I have to do for me, and no one else. I think my sister is having twins. That is the most beautiful thought...it's also pretty sad. She's going have to these babies with such a stupid asshole. He doesn't deserve her. Lying ass...niggas can be so trifling I swear. I have nothing planned for this weekend...well I'm going to Jalie's with the girls...that should be fun!! I'm out...Ciao.
