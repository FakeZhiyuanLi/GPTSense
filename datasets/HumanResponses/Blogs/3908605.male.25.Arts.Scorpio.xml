      So I got the room at the John Street house.  I can't wait to move in September 1st.  Laura and Darcie seem awesome, so it should be all good.  I think this well be move number 12 in the past 4 1/2 years.  We're also playing our first show with The Atomic Machetes from Fredericton on August 12th.  I can't fucking wait for that.  Me and Bruce have been friends for 15 years and have never played a show together.  I've never played at Ginger's Tavern before, but it seems like an all right spot.  I missed Hissy Fit last night.  I wanted to check out SARS and Spincycle Squared but I got lazy and tired.  Next year I guess.  Gonna go to Stage Nine Saturday and see The Stolen Minks.  I've never heard em but have heard great things.

      I was 2 1/2 hours late for work today.  Nobody really noticed.  I couldn't sleep at all last night and didn't fall asleep until 6am.  My alarm went off at 8am and I knew right then I wouldn't make it.  I hate doing that, but whatever.  I gotta talk to Chris tonight.  I'm dreading it.  He turns everything into an arguement and makes it impossible to talk like a reasonable person.  I gotta do it though.

      I guess this is my first post.  I'm just really bored at work and am doing this to kill time at the moment.  I've been sitting at my desk for over 7 hours and have been waiting for the day to end since I started.  I fucking hate Mondays.  I looked at an apartment that I really liked this weekend.  If I get it I'll be living with 2 young girls, I think they're both 20.  Sounds all right to me.  I'd rather wake up every morning and see 2 cute young girls than have to listen to the daily flem-clogged choking that I have to endure from my current roomate.  I hope I get the room.  My band played a show on Friday night and I think it went really well.  When I play I never think to look at the audience, but I did this time and everyone there seemed to be digging it.  Jeremy was sick as a dog, but he sang great.  There was a lot of people I knew there and I had as good a time as I've had since moving to Halifax.  I drank too much and got sick later that night, and I think I may have pissed off one of the bartenders with my drunken banter, but no harm done.  I seem to remember trying to buy a beer off of him for $20 about half an hour after last call.  I don't think he sold it to me because when I put my jeans on Saturday, there was a $20 bill in my pocket.  Saturday morning was rough, but after a couple cups of coffee, a fat J, and my walk home from John Street, I felt much better.  Me and Jer went to see Anchorman later Saturday night.  Very funny, Will Ferrell cracked me up, but Steve Carell stole the movie.  It was much better than Dodgeball, the movie everyone but me loved.
