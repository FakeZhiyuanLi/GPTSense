       Hey all, This is Jared, this is my first post and I'm in Melaka so you can't really expect it to be very good can you? Any way the only reason i started doing this is besause i wasn't going to be shown up by Ethan and Elliot Tan (no offense guys) and because it is kinda nice to have somewhere you can rant and rave about things.  AS you can probably see I wrote this post 5 years ago when I was about 8 years old, which is kinda funny don't you think since I didn't even know what a PC was back then. Well I GTG (that's chat lingo for Got.To.Go by the way) so Catcha ya'll later, Jared  Should i sign my posts? Hmmmm..... Maybe we could have a debate on that. "Should Jared Sign His Blogger Posts?" Oh, right, yeah i just remembered GTG. HAHA. Jared

       Hello All, I'm back, umm I made a mistake on my last posts. Because as you can deduce from reading my posts, I DID post my chair description post. Hehe (nervously). The past few days since I last wrote have been surprisingly uneventful. Apart from the usual scoldings for disobedience, the past few days have been exceedingly dull. My friend Philip (no, not Philip George) was staying over, and that helped to pass the time, but ultimately we had nothing to do. And now, on to the good things that happened, well, when he left, Philip gave me his entire X-Men trading card collection (which he's been collecting since 1995). Each card was worth about 50 cents in 95', but now EACH is worth approximately RM 15. Since Philip's collections consists of about 160 cards, therefore the entire collection is worth around RM 2400!!!! Cool huh? There are or course a few limited editions and suspended animation cards which are worth like RM 30 each. If I sold them (which I don't plan to ever do) I would be rolling in cash. Trading cards of any kind don't seem to have any practical use so that's why I never tried to collect any, with the exception of Pokemon and Digimon cards in 1995-1996. But, in those cases, I started my collections from scrap, not wasting a single cent of my money on booster packs and what not. Hmmm.... My posts seem to be getting progressively longer to me. What do you think? Do my posts seem to jump all over the place to you? Oh well, once again it's time to say goodbye. So, GOODBYE!! Jared

       I'M FINALLY HOME!!!!!! WOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!!!! LOL as you can see I am really very happy to be home. Not that my Grandma and my uncles and aunties are so bad but i just like my house thats all. I am typing this from the "comfort" of one of the dining chairs in my house. If you want to know why i put "Comfort", well, i guess i'll have to describe the chairs to you. Each chair is made of wood, with a wicker seat, the backs are ramrod straight and there is no possible way you can sit comfortably in them. They all have four legs :D and if you try sitting on the edge of one you will recieve a severe ache in the Gluteus Maximus. I would be blasting my Avril music at almost full volume right now, but my grandma is sleeping in the next room, therefore hindering me from reaching the extent of my pleasure. Still, that won't stop me from being my usual happy self. Of course nothing short of a disater COULD stop me from being my usual happy self. I like this Blogger system thing. All i have to do is type to everyone who reads my posts about myself and they hang on every word like....... monkeys. HAHAHAHAHA. I like that analogy, can't you just picture overgrown monkeys in various human costumes hanging off the ends of letters. You can't? Oh well, (sigh) i guess I'll just have to do all the imagining by myself then. Got to run. Ciao Jared

       I'm SOOOOOOOOOO bored, there is nothing to do down here in Melaka,  i learned this really cool trick that lets me fly forward in time. I took the chance to come forward 5 years to see what things are like. i think I'll stay here. BOOOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIINNNNGGGGGG. I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored,   I'm so bored, as you can probably deduce from all this, I am very bored, so very bored. How I long for home, where i can blast my Avril Lavigne Music AND read Anne of Green Gables at the same time. Buh bye now.  Jared

       That wasn't very nice, I just tried to post a new post and guess what happened? When I did the keyboard shortcut for "Post" the whole thing got lost. That is just so unfair. I worked very hard on that post. It was a work of art, a masterpiece if you will. And I don't care if I do say so myself, so there....NYAH. I had a lovely description of my dining chairs in it. Well since you're looking at me that way.... i guess I'll just have to describe them again (sigh). My dining chairs are made of wood (WOW!), their seats are made of wicker ware and are very hard. No matter what position you try, you can never really get comfortable in them. Which is weird don't you think, since the dining table is where you spend most of your time? You don't spend most of your time there? Well  I do and I'm typing this post so just  hush up and  keep reading. NYAH. Now, where was I? Ah yes, the dining chairs.....they have four legs :D. now that the chairs are done with lets move on to language classes. The word NYAH, what does it mean? Well, NYAH is an expression of either impudence or sarcasm. Now all you adults who are reading this are probably going on with the ooooh's and the aaaah's at how many I use. Well, MY NYAH, means the same thing as I told you so, or so there, or whatever. And so after finishing the sessions on chair description and language classes, I am afraid we must part. No no let there not be tears, partings are a part of life and we must learn to acept them. Ah Whatever, all I'm saying is I GTG, so 'till next time, Ciao Jared
