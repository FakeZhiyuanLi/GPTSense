      They want to do the following things:  1.Plans to double  agriculture credit in  3 years       2.Calls for fiscal  consolidation        3.Gross budgetary  support raised to  Rs 1,45,000 Cr      4.Provides for addl  Rs 10,000 cr for  expenditure       5. Calls for 7-8% GDP  growth on sustained  basis.  We have seen so many budgets..promising growth and fiscal consolidation. Ofcourse, Mr.Singh is one of the harbingers of economic revolution in India. So, many people are looking forward to a sensible budget. But, how much is it going to improve the situation of the poor? The IT revolution has created a new creed of middle class. When will the poor get the benefits of the new economy? Will this budget answer all the questions of the poor? hmmmmm....in another 8 hrs..I think everything will be clear and I dont think it is going to be very much different.

      Bangalore - The IT capital of India ( errr....world), the city of Gardens, the city of serene weather, the true cosmopolitan city of India. Bangalore sans rains and traffic is all the above.  The city shines with the beautiful  buildings of IT powerhouses, umpteern number of pubs, sports bars, denim clad muses and irresistable hunks. Bangaloreans are proud of their Casmopolitan city, they love the city. Take them anywhere in the world , they will come back and say nothing is like Bangalore. Such is the greatness of this city and its citizens.  But, look at the city when it rains. The weather is so beautiful that you feel like going for a long drive or getting drenched in the rain.wait, do you think you can afford that?  The rains open up the drains in the city. The drains overflow and the raods are submerged.Many beautiful roads , the showpieces of Bangalore, are filled with drain water and ther is no respite for any vehicle. This submersion of most of the roads of Bangalore is the harbinger of some of the worst traffice snarls.Some blessed souls who have four wheelers are spared to some extent. Atleast the can sit back and enjoy some music when there is a jam...The riders of two wheelers have hell of a time here. You wear jackets, wind cheaters whatever, you are bound to get drenched in the unpredictable rains...and you push through the roads with your knees in drain water. Sometimes , the poor two wheeler cant do anything except stalling...because you cant get the silencer to your seat level.  If this is the story of people who are doing well, imagine the plight of "have nots". The poor have a helluva time here in Bangalore in rainy season ( Is there a season???). Manual Labourers, Construction Workers, and many others.. Bangalore rains even claim the lives of people. Every year , atleast some 50-100 people die due to rains. Someone gets drowned in an overflowing drain, someones' car gets submerged in a drain, someones' house just collapses due to rain, some construction worker dies because a pile of mud just burries him in a duct, a child gets killed because a tree is uprooted by the rains....ther is no end to this list..rain invents new ways of killing people.  What are the authorities doing? They just dont have any clue. They just dont have any clue about why the drainages are overflowing, they are not aware of the traffic condition which is eating away productivities of manny people. They just cant handle the situation...all and all...the authorities are ineffective in handling rains in Bangalore.  When will Bangaloreans enjoy rains rather than cursing rains? I am not born and brought up in Bangalore, but I like the city. The city is killing people in rains rather than sheltering them. What a city or any other place is for if it cannot give shelter to its own people.   God bless Bangalore in Rainy Season.

      The amount of money involved in oneday cricket killed an art called Spin Bowling.Even in the real cricket we saw the decline of quality spinners. Inspired by the Garners, Holdings, Hadleys, Kapils, Wasims , most of the young kids want to become fast bowlers. They think that is the kind of bowling that can intimidate the oppasition. The want to give night mares to the batsmen with the pace.  But, every now and then, every sport has seen some individuals who set standards, who are born for that particular cause, they are the people who are the best at that particular skill.  Shane Warne is one such great player Cricket is gifted with. He revived the dying art of Legspin, he created another version of Spin which is dedlier than the spin bowling. He is the master of flippers, batsmen have no clue what is happening barring some Indian players. The Legerdemine claimed many vicitms ( err ...most as the records state). Records apart, he is one bowler who made the difference at the time of substandard bowlers.  Ofcourse, he had his ups and downs in his personal and professional life. But, I havent seen Prasanna much...I regard Warne as the best bowler I have ever seen. He inspires you so much that you feel like learning legspin.  However, like other legends, he still have one unconquered land..The Subcontinent and the Indian Batsmen.The East for Alexander The Great, Wimbledon for Lendel, French Open for Sampras ....  I salute to this great player. I compare him to the legends like Maradona, Vivian Richards..He is one of that class.  Many more victims for this great bowler.

          The great game of cricket has become a cheap entertainment for masses. And , so called Asians are excelling in this art. The Asia cup.....haahhhaaahhhaaa......what level the game of cricket has come to? You dont watch such substandard cricket ever in life. On one side of the globe , Australians ans NewZealanders are playing a level of cricket which you dont see often, but that is soemthing good that is happening to cricket.   I dont understand what do they want to achieve by holding this fully series called Asia Cup. Including teams like Hongkong, UAE and Bangladesh. They dont even know the rules of cricket properly. I think my galli cricket is a better site to watch than this. And, the so called " Test playing teams ( what is there in playing....what matters is winning...)"...are worse than these new teams. Are they playing Cricket???? I was really disappointed the way India plyed in the first two matches.&nbsp; The so called great players played some poor shots and the Captain ....huh...what has he had&nbsp; in his mind??....They might win against Bangladesh and Hongkong...might go to the Finals and win the cup...but this will remain as the worst of the Series ever played in Asia.  Dying to see Australians in India.&nbsp; Man.....watz happening to me....a die hard Sachina and India fan......losing interest in their game......  &nbsp;

      I happened to see a Telugu movie over the weekend..names Sree Anjaneyam ( in reference to the God Anjaneya). This is a shit of a movie to the "spiderman"&nbsp;and Hollynwood freaks.&nbsp;yeah, they think only Hollywood can make better movies. I beg to differ. The Tamil and&nbsp;Telugu industry has some&nbsp;great directors who can make really good movies.   Let me come back to the movie under discussion.&nbsp;The movies starts with&nbsp;the launch of a&nbsp;big water dam which will feed the villages around. But, as usual, a group headed by one village biggie tries to stop the dam citing various reasons ALA Medha&nbsp;Padgars, Arundhathi Roys...   Ofcourse the movie digresses towards some trivial things in&nbsp;the course of time, if you look beyind the scantily dressed heroine and dramatic bahkthi seens...there is much in this movie.  The dirty politics involed behind these water dams and the real intentions of people who claim that they are " Sangha Sanskrthas" or " Samaj Sevaks".   Though I was disappointed at the end of the movies that the Director could have done better to focus on the real issue rather than sentiments and bhakthi.

      What a match it was? India Won a thriller. Zaheer bowled a superb last over....these were the reactions of myriad number of cricket fans across the country. But, I think the match was fixed by the sponsors to bring India into finals. How could the empire miss the 3 wides bowled by Irfan pathan? How could a bolwler who gave away 45 runs in 5 overs gave only 6 runs in the last over?.....they are all debateable....but ....the buggers have fixed the match ..that is very clear....  I pray god that they dont play cricket here in Aisa. Everything is dictated by sponsors&nbsp; and they care only abt money ...meanwhile ...none btothers abt the harm being doe to the game of Cricket.  Let alone Australia , NewZealand, England, WI, ...all non Asian nations play cricket....hell with these fixed matches...........................

          Our great Skipper gave a  paper statement day before the Asia Cup Finals. Mr. Ganguly said " we are not chokers". Yes, he is right. They are not chokers, but HE ...He is a choker...bloody...he is one of the reasons India lost in Asia Cup finals. Bugger, didnt have any idea what he was doing. Played 20 balls and made 4 runs.....increased the burden on Sachin....., the great wall played like a Hole in the Wall and went away cheap.....wat happened to all the promising youongsters..........all BS...  Now , I think the Indian Team is just overhyped....Sehwags, yuvrajs....nuthing but a bunch of over hyped youngsters like Wayne Rooney of Football.....they cant play .....they cant play any quality cricket.....  Every time people blame one and only great player for losing.....he was the one who was stranded without partners and put under some stupid pressure...  I see a conspiracy theory behind.....  If India had won y'day.....Sachin wud ve got all the name for his bowling and batting....and our skipper and Wall dont want it to happen....they think Sachin is becoming a legend ...lets  put him down....bloody buggers.....they can lose a because they dont watn Sachin to get all the name.....  but onething they dont know...what ever happens...Sachin is already a Legend and nothing can change his status of being the Greatest Batsman of all the time...........................

             Good that 31st August was a Saturday. I saw my cell phone chirping  at random intervals on Saturday night. I was surprised to see messages from people I never bothered to talk to, wishsing me Happy Friendshipday. Most of them are just strangers to me, I dont even talk to them regularly. Then , one idea struck my mind...let me see how many of my really close friends send this message. But, I didnt send any message to any of my friends. So, do I expect any mesasage from them????....Blank...Man...I never bothered whether my friends wished me on that night , because I know friendship doesnt need all these things.  I started thinking what exactly is this idea of friendship. I felt really strange to think of one person whom I can call a very good friend., because a friend is someone who knows you in and out. wait.....is my definition of friendship correct????...Many people esp in Bangalore,...call whoever they know "friends"...err I am not talking about that Series on Star World.   I dont kow...I cannot call any one my friend just like that....because  I attach some value to it and it is something beyond loafing around and freaking around.  You meet someone over a chat or online forum and suddenly he becomes your friend...BS....you dont even know an ioata about him/her. But, it is okey because people behave errr pretend nice with the people they dont know..and someone else recently gave me a gyan saying that you should not be selfish in Friendship.......BS...what is that Selfishness.......goddd....I get goose pimples to think about not being selfish.....someone( so called friend ) asks for your help and you are not in a situation to help though you can help....gawd...they start calling you selfish and conceited....  I give up....if it is helping and taking help in return which defienes friendship....we better call it Business rather than friendship.....I got confused thinking about all these things Friendship and Selfishness......  I am happy to breathe for my self and eat for myself....I can not breathe and eat for someone else.....  The Selfish.....errr most selfish.....I am proud of it........................

      Gone are the days of "stupid", "idiot", " bloody fool". I dont think any one uses the word "scoundrel" any more. It is the same with even Rascal.  The new genration has found new ways of abusing...there are better words to express anger and disgust. People used to utter words like "oops", "shuks", " oh my goodness" to express annoyance .... but times chaged a lot...from British english to we graduated towards American English...not only the way we dress , do business and think...but the way we use our language is also influenced by the one and only US of A.  What do you utter even when something falls from your hands???? no doubt the golden four letter word "F***".I would recommend the speech of the great Osho on this word. It is use in anger, despair, distress, surprise and even when you are happy. This word adds itself very comfortably with other words as in f***ing bast***, f***ing a**ho**....there are so many of this genre....  It is really surprising to listen all these uttered by many gals to a guy like me who came from a small time town. But , Bangalore is a cosmo. No offence to anyone...this is the only big city I ve seen for more than 2 years.  I have seen most of the guys using only "f" word mose of the time and they ve a diff lingo for diff things. But the urban gals ve a very unique lingo which comprises of "bitch", "basta**", "SOB", MFs.....the liste is endless....the more you use these words the more aggressive and bold you are. They associate boldness and outspokenness with these words....  To them, every other gal they dont like is a "bitch", every other guy they dont like is either "basta**" or " SOB"....I think an overdose towards the fair sex....err...lets take a break...  we stopped using words like nonsense and rubbish....we use crap and fuc*all.....  I was talking to a gal whom I know about a traffic jam and the word used to describe that jam was " Fuc*all" traffic jam....sounds really good...isnt it?  But I really wonder about onething....do they really know the meaning of the words they speak....words like " bastar*", "MF", "SOB"......or do they really mean those?  It is the new world and it is going to be newer.....and think many more words will join the above list....  last but not least.....which word do you use to disagree with someone....??????  "balls".....i really dont know how this word came into existence.......

      It's really great to see your old friends after a long time and spend some time with them recollecting the events of those old days. I met few of my engineering friends in the course of the weekend. I met some of them almost after some 3 years....and we spoke about those college days...it is really amusing....  all those days i was in college,  i used to dream about my job and my work...i was eager to work and learn real things....  but now, I think about those days and wish that had lasted forever....the joyful days will never return.........wittisms' in classes, sarcasm towards the profs, who cares attitude, those  regular " get out of the class " diktats from some of the irritated lecturers, those manipulations in Labs ( I never got any graph properly, i used to draw the graph and mark the points ..:-D..)...and those gyaan sessions by some of the successful and talented seniors....  and gals....my class never had a good looking gal atleast....so, we used to go to other classes sometimes ...in the name of meeting some frns in other classes...though everone knows the reason.....  and the amount of leg pulling ...it never had any limits...even some generous profs were victims of this ....  and the skits on annual fests....we used to spend days to pen down the scripts..select the cast....reharsal.....  those all skits were superhits in  college and we used to get lot of compliments from the profs' and expecially Juniors ( read as Junior gals .. ;-)...)...  for the first one year these junior gals used to call us " Sir "....it was funny man...really funny.....  there is no end to these little sweet things......i was bound by a sense of nostalgia for the entire Saturday.....and ended it with a dinner in Pizz Hut with cousins.....though admired a gal waiting outside for most of the time....  Sunday :  hmmmm.....missed badmintion and swimming....slept off till 10 AM....  got a call frm cousin asking y I was missing.....hmmm....spent some 3hrs playing Carrom with cousins....and headed to the so called Southindia restaurant " Malgudi " on Outer Ringroad....  Lunch was not that great but okey there....not upto the hype....  but the evening ended on a high with Arsenal and ManU match....Community shield match...  that was really great....a matcg worth watching....my fav Arsenal won hands down against arch rivals ManU.....  cudnt get sleep in the night as usual....but had to sleep to wake up on a Monday Morning..thinking about another monotonous 5 day strectch......

      I dont know what is there in Mr. Premjis' mind when he suggested the Karnataka Govt to increase the professional tax on IT workers by 100% because they are earning " handsome" salaries. Why cant he pay 70% tax on his income because he is one of the richest in India? He talls the govt that by doing this they can improve the tax collection. Yeah , Mr. Premji is correct. IT workers  cant hide their incomes like politicans  and the tax can be cut directly from their salaries.  Mr. Premji wants sops for IT industry but wants his employees to be taxed. How sad??? It is time to move from this much Hyped IT industry..... :lol:

      May be centuries of foreign rule is the cause for this that we as Indians always think that the so called " White" are superior to us. It is not people who are illiterate and unlearned but those who are highly educated and learned feel inferior to average whites. We compare whatever we do against the standards of the west, we aim to match the quality of the west in whatever we do. Right from school poems to university education, we are obsessed with the west. Though we learned english from the British, we try to speak english like Americans do. Let us look at various aspects of this "aping".  India has a rich cultural heritage which gave us lot of literary and aesthetic works which are non paralled in human history.  How many of the kids( even youngsters ) know that there is something called " Panchatantra " which teaches various aspects of living in society? But they know Aespos tales which never match this great Panchatantra.  How many of us even bother to listen to our Classical Music let alone appreciating? But we head bang to Metallica, swing to the music of Santana, Bryan Adams etc....  Hollywood makes a crappy movie starring a female nothing more than an Anorexic and dressed in pushup garments...tells us that it is the real story of some Erin Bro......( I dont know the spelling)...announces an Oscar. We say that the movie is " awesome"( this  word is peculiar to Bangalore..there is nothing good or bad..only " awesome" or "sad")  and Julia Roberts is the most beautiful woman on this face of the earht.  A Mani Ratnam makes a movie like " Nayagan" or " Agni Naksathram" ...and we say that the movie is ordinary and our industry should look upto Hollywood to make movies.  It is not only movies...ask any youngster about his/her fav dish. You get a reply which will surprise you. You start thinking whether his/her mom makes any Indian dish at home. We like to go to Pizza Huts or KFCs regulary though the food you get there is not worth the money you pay for it.  How many of us read books written by Indian Writers? Are we well versed with the literary works compiled by many great sages aeons ago? We say that they are old fashioned and not relevant to the present times. We flock to bookstalls to buy LOTRs' and Harry Potters which are nothing but fantasy. There are some umpteen number of Indian books containing better fiction. We never bother to read them as we cant tell our friends about it. They will look at you as someone cheap and uneducated. Many argue that language is the barrier. Most of the literary works here are in Sanskrit and not many people know it. Are we born English? Havent you learned english as another language? Ofcourse, learning sanskrit is a bit tougher than learning English. Then, how many of us read books written in regional languages and our mother tongue.  The word mother tongue reminds me of a funny conversation I had with one gal. I met this gal in one of the trainings in my prev org. We were talking about different languages and I asked her about her mother tongue. Here is the reply " well...ummm...actually...I dont have a mother tongue. The only language I know is english" I asked her whether english is her mother tongue " well...ummm...not exactly......"  I almost burst out laughing...how is that possible?...I thought abouot it for some time and left it at that stage.  Yea, liking some of the things or all the things which are western is not wrong. Diff people have diferent tastes and some of us might like things which are not Indian. But, aping others blindly is worse than any other form of depravity. We should never forget what we are and where we came from. If we dont know about ourselves and try to be like somone else...we lost our identity and Individuality. Other might feel good that you like their things ..but they will not respect you because you dont have any individuality or orignality.  Most of the things I listed above make me think that we will lose our Indianness in the course of time. We might become another colony of US of A, a pool of people without any thing of our own, witout any identity....my heart shrinks at the very idea of that state.  Just we need to realise that " a civilisation or culture that survived centuries of foreign rule, centuries of looting ,centuries of other religious and cultural invasions is something we should be proud of. We need to have self respect to respect out traditon and culture. Even though you reach great heights in a foreign land, you are a stranger there. "  To respect others and like others, you need to repsect yourself and like yourself. Anything else will be just " aping".

       The Master retires from International football     The great Zizu retired from international football. He wont be playing for French national team any more. Though we would see hin in Reals' team , we would miss him in the next Soccer world cup. He is one of those class players who is very simple and humble. He is not over hyped like a David Beckham, but his greatness was underrated in non-football circles. That trademark header is a joy to watch and the way he can change the game is incredible.  We definitely will miss one of the class players in International Football.   The Champion Keeps Going     Hungarian Grand Prix..and it will be another win for Michael Schumacher. As there is lot of noise going on about Jenson Buttons' move to Williams next season, this grand prix will be very interesting to watch. Though McLaren is looking good, Kimmi has to pray for some luck in this race. Anticipating another Ferrari whitewash......  The weekend would be great with some EPL Football action and the Grand Prix...   Ohhh....I forgot completely about the Kick Off of Olympic Games....being an Indian what can I talk about Olympics. Hope our Hockey team tries to Salvage some lost pride. Atleast a Medal for more than one billion people.

      Yahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! At last I could convince my elder brother to get an idiot box into the house. I bought a new Sony Wega over the weekend and it entered with a bang. A nice telugu movie to start with, next 2 days witnessed a ManU Vs Chelsea EPL match and the Invincible Schumi in Hungary. Now this insomniac has a company to stay awake. I missed TV a lot  for all these days as I am staying away from home. Added to that, a room mate in the form of my elder brother could stop me for all these days. But, this time around I could convince him. His theory of Idiot box makes you lazy and listless couldnot stop me.  Ahoyyy! I got my CAT 2004 application form on Saturday. Not sure whether I will prepare for it..but I cant resist the tempation of writing CAT. This time I made one of my friends take the form for me ...luck factor...:-))).  I am sure the idiot box will reduce my reading time and activity time. I will be sitting and watching some or the other sport or a gulti movie rather than reading a book. But I need to read some good books I have with me.  Monday ... I am in my new office location. This is one of those typical Wipro Offices without Yahoo! messenger and MSN Messenger. I will miss most of my Chat friends. But the ambience is good, the coffee you get here is supposed to be the best among all Wipro Banglore offices. Even, Mr. Premji was surprised that this quality coffee is available here.  His heart might have skipped a beat thinking that they would be spending extra money for this coffe.  But, nothing is like a good coffee especially for a Teetotaller.  The drive from my home to this office is about some 15 Kms , including an 8 KM stretch on the Killer ( Hosur) road. Wipro has so many buses to this place, but  I prefer to come by my bike. The ride was awesome this morning, I loved it.  Errr...need to catch up with some work now.....
