        to whom this may concern;   is anyone else pissed at disney for the crappy movies that they have been putting out? they've had millions of classics and in the early-mid nineties they put out a streak of four unbeleivable movies.  the little mermaid, beauty and the beast, aladdin, and the lion king.  disney will never ever again equal this 'streak' again, stop trying because it isnt working and your not fooling anyone. you suck and then you went to pixar to help you make movies and since they have now dumped your ass. so due to the fact that you will never equal that stature again you ruin your legacy by putting out sequels to your classic movies and movies that just have no buisness having one. you made  'simbas pride, retun of jafar, a beauty and the beast christmas, and return to the sea'  just trying to make money on great movies that youve now cheapened with these crappy  sequels. was there really a need to make lady in the tramp 2 or cinderella 2?  whats next.....alice goes back into wonderland, that dork puts the sword back in the stone, bambi's dad gets shot, and sleeping beauty falls asleep again?    what else has disney done to suck...oh yeah you bought the right to the cartoon 'doug' which was a great cartoon then you made it crappy. then you made inspector gadget into a movie.  newsflash  dr. claw wasnt a person. all you ever saw of him was one of his arms...why did you think it was ok for you to hire and actor to play him and show him as a human. that was one of the things that made the cartoon great, not knowing what/who dr. claw is.   disney is working on a law to make it so that you cannot record a televison show on your vcr so you can view it later. they want that to be outlawed and they support the dmca and sssca(if you dont know those are is look it up on google) they also are trying to make this happen. you go to a store and buy some crappy rap cd and put it in your cd player to listen to. they are trying to make it so you have to pay a fee everytime you listen to it even though you already bought it.   disney is also linked to sweatshops in vietnam. the keyhinge toys company where 17-20 year old women are making 6 cents an hour while working 10 hour shifts 7 days a week. thats 60 cents a day. the average meal over there costs 70 cents, thereforth they work a 10 hour day and cant even buy one meal, nevermind a family to feed and rent to pay. they must be proud of themselves. especailly michael eisner....hes the ceo of disney. in 1998 he   averaged $100,000 an hour!  hes made 700 million in the last 5 years. disneys revenue is almost 2 billion dollars every month. what the fuck is that? disney sucks and everyone should boycott them             sincerely,       everyone who thinks disney        has too much money

       (update 6/24/4) (added a new last paragraph)   what is the point of having north dakota as a state? does it really serve any purpose? is it helping out the united states at all? there are like 1,000 people living in the state....their only claim to fame is a decent college hockey team, we really don't need them as a state. what we should do is build a 300 foot wall around the 'state' border and move all the people who live there into real states. now we can put your 70 thousand square miles to good use.   now im going to bitch about prison for a little bit (everything will make sense in a minute) prisons are just as overrun with inmates as our crappy school systems are with ghetto children. why should my tax dollars be going into the prisons so that jackasses who murdered their wife and kids or serial rapists? thats bullshit. why should i be working my ass off so that 40 percent of my paycheck goes to them eating, working out, and going to college? wouldnt it make a lot more sense to have that money go into the school systems so they wont be as crowded? we could use that money for more schools, more teachers, giving teachers raises, and new books that dont refer to the civil rigts movement as 'a problem ahead' these assholes in prison shouldnt be allowed to watch tv, work out so when they escape they can beat up and out run out cops, and get a college education where im footing the bill. either the money goes into schools, a worthy cause, or give me my damn money back.    california is currently 12 billion dollars in debt. yet they are currently building a 335 million dollar prison. illinois reports show that and average adult inmate cost $18,500 to keep an inmate behind bars and they had around 45,000 adults in custody. thats fucking 832 million dollars spend annually to keep them behind bars. 832 million. and thats just in that state ! what the fuck is that? do you have any idea how many teachers you could hire and how many books you could buy with that money? why should criminals get all this and our children suffer? no wonder our country gets dumber and dumber every generation, no wonder we have a moron in the white house. it starts in the schools and when they arent getting a chance to thrive our country suffers. god help my grandchildren.   so my suggestion is that we should get rid of most of the prisons [at least all the maximum security ones] and instead of sending the hardcore criminals their we should fly a plane over my new north dakota [you know...the one with walls] strap a parachute on mr. iliketostabmynieghborshot16yearolddaughterthenfuckherdeadbody and let him play survivor among him and his crime brethren. dont give them food or shelter. they should suffer and struggle for survival just like those they killed. they want food, then let them figure out how to hunt, they want shelter then let them figure out how to build a shelter. i hate people saying that they are people and deserved to be treated humanely and all this bs. fuck them. if they took the right to live from somebody they dont deserve to have rights of their own. the death penalty is a good idea. if you think otherwise may the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits. you kill somebody [unless it is justified... like in self-defense] then you should be killed as well. its pretty simple. this way tax dollars are freed up and now can go where they should go - schools, aids and cancer research, me, whores, or i can even figure out how to solve the national deficit.   so the national deficit is at some Xtrillion dollars. i dunno its low in the trillions like 3 or 4 or something. why dont they do this... lets say illinois is a median state...sounds about right? if they spend 832 mil every year to keep inmates in prision then this is realistic..if an average state spends 500 mil keeping them in [obviously cali, tx, ny is more and ri, delaware, hawaii is less] then as a nation we spend 25 billion annually...probably more. why cant every year we spend half of than on schools and half fixing out debt? we wouldnt have to borrow 87 billion to fight in this pointless 'war' we could supoport our own sorry asses and not only bring ourselves out of debt, but not be in debt to any other nations. granted, 12.5 billion a year will take a while...but its better than continuing to fall further and further in the red, my way we'll eventually come out of it instead of falling and falling more. holy crap i figured out how to get rid of the prisons, fix the entire school system, and solve the national deficit.  your going to tell everyone and pass this off as your idea, arent you?

        so there is this stupid chick who is suing the red sox because she got hit in the eye with a foul ball. dumbass. if you got hit in the eye then thats your own fault. you should of been paying attention to the game then seeing which of the guys you were nailing just called your cell phone. its a fucking baseball game.....the ball is going to go in the crowd. this isnt new. its been this way since the game started in the 1880's. have you been living under a fucking rock or something ? the average life of a baseball is 7 pitches...there are like some 250-300 pitches during a game..so thats an average of 35 balls used during a game, in which 90 percent make it into the stands one way or another. dumbass. there are signs all over fenway that warn that bats and balls will end up out of the playing area and to be careful....the p.a. announcer says it before the game....its even on the ticket. dumbass. each ticket clearly states "the holder assumes all risk and danger incidental to the game of baseball, or preperation therefore including specifically (but not exclusively) the danger to be injured by thrown or flying bats and thrown or batted balls and agrees that the participating clubs, their agents, and players are not liable from injuries from such causes" which means ....your a dumbass and if you get hit with a ball your an idiot and shouldnt be allowed to sue anyone. you dont see people with carpal tunnel syndrome suing dell or aol. the red sox should sue her for stupidity and wasting their time. i hope shes driving on the pike one day and manny hits a shot over the monster through her windshield. dumbass

        ill start by bitching about these guys. we all remember the ninja turtles from when we were a kid...they kicked ass, they rocked, and it was a fantastic cartoon. now, like everyotherfuckingthing in this world they had to remake it and try to make money off a cartoon/concept from 15 years ago due to the fact that no one can thing of original good ideas on their own. dont get me wrong, i love the turtles.....i have all 3 movies and the first season on dvd..but they shouldnt of remade this show....and if you are going to piss everyone off by doing it, at least do it right. this is what they fucked up [so far] in the new cartoons..........    1] april o'niel is a fucking goddamn news reporter....she goes around in her yellow jumpsuit and reports news....she is not a labratory assistant for baxter stockman..get it right - news, yellow jumpsuit, reporter.    2] the turtles are all different shades of green....i actually dont think that this is a bad idea, but the original turtles were all green, keep it that way...we dont change  the colors of the flag for every new president, do we ?    3] splinter attacked the shredder before splinter mutated...he left a claw mark on the shredders face, henceforth the mask shredder wears....splinter did not attack some random member of the foot clan and leave the mark on him    4] baxter stockman is white, not black    5] the theme song....the original theme song kicked ass, the new one sucks    6] brain/krang doesnt even exist    7] neither do rocksteady and bebop [yet?]  anything else i missed, post a comment and ill fix it... stupid networks

      catwoman is a crappy movie. i havent even seen it, but there is no way that it can be worth the $9.50 that it costs to see it. they didnt even get the characters name right - her real name is supposed to be selina kyle not patience phillips. the movie does not take place in gotham city, where she lives. her costume looks more like an s&m outfit then something a 'superhero' would wear. lastly catwoman isnt black...no offense but thats stupid, they are making a new superman and they offered the role to the rock he turned it down because he didnt think anyone would buy superman being half black and half samoan. it would be&nbsp;the equivalent of making a new batman where bruce wayne isnt batman, hes not rich, and his parents are&nbsp;alive or&nbsp;a&nbsp;superman movie played by an asian midget who cant&nbsp;fly, has a green and yellow outfit, and isnt from krypton.&nbsp;the rock is smart. the producer of catwoman is a moron. the directer of catwoman is a moron. halle berry is a moron.

      if you have to describe yourself as a bbw, then your not beautiful, your just a fat mess and need to stop eating and get some exercise  does anyone else find it disturbing that santa scrambled spells satan?  i figured how to tell if the radio station your listening to is ghetto - you know how inbetween songs when they have listeners say "your listening to todays best mix on 98.5!" or crap like that...the radio station at work, hot 97.7 [shut up - i work in brockton, its what the homies listen to] had a caller the other day say "i want to send a shout out to d-von, my babys daddy and jamal my other babys daddy"  who started 'the wave' at sporting events? did a drunk guy in the bleachers just stand up one day and say, "hey...everyone should all jump in the air and throw their hands up in order because that will rock and everyone will like it and do it for the next 40 years?"  we should extract some dinosaur dna and kinda pull a jurassic park thing - sent the dinosaurs to destroy iraq and afganastan so our soldiers dont die. because way to many have. have like a device around their neck to kill them so when they get out of line we can take care of them  think of this.....the doctor for hitler's mother tried to convince her to get an adoption. she obviously didnt. imagine how crappy she feels[felt] after all the shit he did. imagine a world without hitler. no holocaust. the 10 million jews wouldnt of died...there would be alot more people in this world...imagine all the offspring that would of came about. world war two wouldnt of happened. the world today would be so different because everything that has happened has been a spinoff from hitler.

      read the title. what is so fun about a 'candy bar' that is that small. it shouldnt even be considered a bar. its fucking bite size. that isnt fun at all. i dont want to be walking down the street and flicking a snickers up into the air and catching it in my mouth. thats what popcorn and m&m's are for. who decided that 'fun size' would be an appropriate name for this? how about 'bite and a half size' or 'swallow as a whole size' as better names. you know what would be fun.....a candy bar the size of a hummer. that would kick ass. it would take 2 years to eat. whenever your looking for something to pick at or you get the munchies at 3 in the morning you would always have something to eat instead of a package of arm and hammer and a stick of butter. think about how cool that would be - a candy bar so big you would have to bungee cord it to the top of your car to bring home. that would be fun.

      this is the first in a series of guest posts.....  this one is by matt    so i just saw a commercial on tv for a coffin. yes, a mail-order coffin. you can now, from the comfort of your own home, call a toll-free number and purchase a coffin for your loved one's final resting. what in the holy afterlife is going on? how do they deliver it? it must arrive on your doorstep in a massive 500 lb. crate. the mailman will probably get a hernia. does it come with a cardboard cut-out of a random stiff (kind of like how picture frames comes with photos already in them of people too good looking to be in your gene pool)? what next, they mail it to you with return postage, you stuff the living impaired in it and ship it off to some storage facility? we'll call it the e-z-corpse program. "for just 14 easy flex payments of $49.87, you too can not let the afterlife interrupt your life! call now! operators are standing by!"    seriously, the idea of buying a coffin through the mail just freaks me out of my pantaloons.

      these are all true stories..........   An woman got in a furious argument with her 57-year-old boyfriend in their Milwaukee apartment, and tried to light him on fire. She doused him with lighter fluid and sparked a cigarette lighter, but she had also doused herself. She caught on fire. He didn't. She died of her burns. She was 31   A high school science teacher in Smithfield, N.C., wanted to demonstrate to his students that if you drink too much milk, you'll throw up because of the acidity. He had the kids drink a gallon of milk in an hour. They threw up. He was fired   A TV news cameraman went to film a story about dangerous intersection in Omaha, Neb. He was struck by a car and killed   A man in Trondheim, Norway, purposely roared past a police car at 85 mph because he wanted to lose his drivers license. Seems he was tired of driving his girlfriend everywhere. A court granted his wish: no license for a year   As a female attorney was arguing a case in a courtroom in Bordeaux, France, the judge surreptitiously lifted his robe, unzipped his pants and masturbated. No one noticed except for a reporter from La Charente Libre, a regional newspaper, who said he saw the judge "making unambiguous gestures." The judge has been suspended and is being examined by mental health professionals   A drunken man walked into a Shreveport, La police headquarters to complain that his car had been stolen. The police arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol. Five days later, after smoking some marijuana, he returned to the police headquarters to complain about how he was treated earlier. They then arrested him for driving under the influence of marijuana.

      if the terrorists are going to bomb the dnc, then shutting down 93 isnt going to stop them. come on, do you really think if they are planning on bombing the fleetcenter that this will stop them? we knew of the 9/11 attacks and we didnt stop them, if they really wanted it done, it will be done. plus they lied to you, 93 wasnt really even shut down, they just said it was. i drove right through from randolph through boston and nothing happened, between the 4-1 o'clock window. a couple of exits were shut down, and they were checking any semi's that drove through. thats about it. they said 93 was only open to 'local traffic' whatever that means. anyway i drove through, no one did anything, all they had was a state trooper with his lights on chillin' on the braintree merge. whoopie.   as i said, if the terrorists wanted to attack us, it would of happened, even if 93 was really shut down. here are some other ways they could of gotten into boston: walked, flown, drove through the backroads, or taken a boat. boston isnt that hard to get into.
