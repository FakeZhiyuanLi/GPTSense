      Wah! The common tests are in three days time and I have not even started preparing for them. How am I going to pass if I do not read through and understand my lecture notes, textbooks, do a lot of exercises and ask my teachers if there is anything at all that I do not understand. Now i am staying back at school to finish up my homework. I feel that I will not do my homework were I to stay at home because at home there are so many fun things that I can do that I forget all about school. I only have a problem with mathematics. My teacher keeps pestering me to pass up my asignments. It is not because I am lazy or cannot be bothered, I just need more time to understand the concepts.

      Hah.. yesterday I went with three other friends to audition for teachers day. We turned up as some boy band, sang an edited version of... oops I forgot the title. It's some boyzone song. I cannot believe I went through it, I cannot believe my friend persuaded me to go through with it. Now I am waiting for my friend to call back to see if we got in. I hope not.. because I am not so sure about singing in front oh the entire school anyway. Physics test today and I hope I pass. Came back and my whole family went to Johor without me. Actually I didn't mind.. I am sick of going there anyway. I'd rather be out at the shopping malls of Singapore.

      Back in school after 4 days of rest. Today I heard rumours from my friend that I was  chosen for the 'Student Leadership Experience' camp. I think it will be fun because I can get to know more people. I still am not familiar with all the year one's yet but I hope to know everyone soon enough. My job is to make sure I know all their names so that we can get along as friends under one flag, the MI flag. It has been three months since I started breakdancing and I know a few moves but I hope to become a pro in two or three years.

      My first time writing a blog. Hmm.. well we all start somewhere I guess. I decided to start today because it is the day after the nation's 39th  birthday (HAppY birthdAy SingApOrE!) and myself turning 18 in six months time. A new beginning lah. Two days ago I went to Pan Pacific Hotel with my family to catch the fireworks display near the Esplanade. It was my auntie who booked the hotel room. Wow, it was such a spectacular display. I was watching from the 29th floor by the balcony and the hotel was just a few metres away from Marina Promenade. The fireworks were blasting like right in front of my face man!. Never have I ever seen fireworks that close before. If only I was out with my friends that night(sigh). The blasts were particularly deafening. I felt like my ears were going to pop. After the fireworks display we had dinner and headed back home. Yesterday, National Day, I can not believe I missed the whole show because went bowling in the evening. Luckily I managed to catch the fireworks display when we headed out for dinner. Today, even better, never did a thing, stayed at home and slept the whole day (lAzY bOy! I tirEd whAt).
