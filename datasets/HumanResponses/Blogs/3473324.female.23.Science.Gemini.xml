      I am in my office, finished everything AGAIN... with not too much to do.  My manager isn't in and neither are a couple other CRAs from my study... tempting to leave even earlier then when I should, but I wont... I only have to be here until 2:30 thank goodness.    Anyway, I love the news for some reason now.  I used to never like it.  Now every morning I gotta watch it.  Even though its a bunch of sad stuff mostly or things that can make you angry... so, then i guess that means that my day normally starts off with me being sad or mad?  ha.  Nah, cause I got my Jesus and so I have joy.  And plus, I watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer now also when Im getting ready in the morning, after the news of course... LOL.  I never ever watched that before, but one day I just had it on... and, the story line isn't that bad... now Im drawn into the characters for some odd reason, probably because they are all weird.    Speaking of my morning... I was walking into work and my friend Becky pulls in as Im walking and she waves to me as she is pulling in a spot real fast and all the sudden I hear crunch... she scrapes the whole front side of her car on the curb cause she was waving to me... She thought it was funny though... good thing.  Also, we have geese here at my work... a million of them it seems.  They all trot around with there little baby geese and crap all on our sidewalks.  So low and behold, right in front of the side door I use there is a pile of crap smooshed... I know that they do it on purpose.  They are cute though.  Hahaha.    One more thing... I had to call the contact lady today b/c I opened up one of my contacts the other day and it was ripped... so I left a message and told her to call my cell.  Then, a project assistant here at work was waiting on an important phone call and had to go to use the bathroom really quick... so she wanted me to answer her phone and give an important message.  Do you know that the contact lady called my cell and I answered and she asked me what contacts I had and I couldnt remember the name of them... so Im thinking, thinking, thinking.... then I remember!  And then... the project assistants phone rings... OH NO! And I can't let it keep ringing or I'll miss the call... so I did what any normal person would do and I asked the contact lady to hold... do you know what she then said to me?  She said, "Make it quick now, make it quick."  And not in a nice tone either... I was like and WHO is the customer here?!  ha.  At any rate, I have to go pick it up.  yippee.    So I say get me out of here I want to start my weekend! :)    Thought:   Do you ever really wonder how there are people out there that really don't believe in God?  Its so sad... I mean, nature is God's first testimony.  Read Psalm 19... the heavens, trees and stars, they have no words to speak but their voice is very loud.  Hmmm..... I pray that God is my only aim today.

      So I met up with Mrs. Snyder tonight at Bertuccis.  I love the food there... some people (like the Doughtens) don't care for it too much, but I love it.  Anyway, so she brings me a million pictures to look at b/c I love looking at her pics, she takes really good ones and she has been everywhere which is awesome.  She wanted me to pick out some so she could blow them up for me to put in my apartment... a birthday gift :)  Not only is she giving me those pics, but she took me out for dinner and gave me money...WOW  Then she came back to my place to take a look at the new apartment... so it was a good night :)  She told me that she is housing this guy next fall... his name is Adam, me and Bry use to play with him all the time growing up... how nice is that of them?  She said she has the room so why not... and he needs a place to stay cause his parents live at the beach and he still has one year left of college.  Mrs. Snyder also just graduated from college with her bachelors this month... she went to class and worked full time and finished... I saw her pics (of course :)) and she walked next to this girl, Shayla, who used to be my best friend growing up... how funny is that?  So, this was a get to know Sue Snyder blog I guess... but it was a fun night. I wanted my mom to come, but we couldnt get a hold of her.  I wish she could have been there :(  I miss my mom.    Well I don't know why Im not in bed since I havent had much sleep lately... Tomorrow will be a nice day at work cause we get out at 2:30... that will give me some time to rest before the weekend starts.  Im trying to convince my friend Fay to get a blogger account... we'll see.  Alright... well no more prarie dogging tonight... I'm all done thankfully... we'll just wait until the morning!    Good nizzle.

      Jury Duty.  Sounds great doesn't it?  Duty... just keep saying that word to yourself a bunch of times over and over and thats exactly what it is... a bunch of DOODY!!!!!  Tuesday I wake up at 5:30am to make sure I have enough time to get ready, do some morning things, go to the gas station and make it into Downtown Wilmington by 8:30am.  Do you know that I listened to those stinkin' directions more than 5 times-they were recorded on the Doodys number that they give you to call.  Over and Over i listened just to get it right.  They were nothing but WRONG.  Doody.  Thankfully, I made it.  They send you into this sea of 150 people just sitting there reading the doody booklet they pass out... then after about an hour of waiting this lady comes in and doody starts coming out of her mouth.  Do you know that she said "Do NOT have your cell phones or pagers on in this room or in the jury room or it will be taken from you and you will not be able to get it back for 2 weeks" she said this about 10 times in a row to drill it into our brains... i was like, come on lady, no one can be that stupid to not have turned their cell phone off even after the FIRST time you told us the consequence... so after about 10 minutes from when she said that, you hear "ring ring"... i was like are you kidding me?!  luckily for that guy the woman wasn't in there...some people.  So we have orientation and then a woman comes in to announce the first 35 lucky people to go to the doody room and maybe from there they will be one of the 14 to go on a jury doody trial.  I was not picked... sat around, read some of a book.... another hour or two passes... the same woman comes in again and picks another 35 people... did not call my name... so i wait.  I see this post in the back of the room and a chair right next to it and think to myself, "I could sit in that chair and rest my head on that post."  So guess what... I did... and I fell asleep... and i woke up a couple times and noticed my mouth was hanging way open... Then I get startled and wake up feeling like I had slept for forever, which I did sleep for a good while b/c my face had that layer of sleep oil that you get on it after you wake up from a long nights rest... you know, the reason why we wash our faces every morning... or at least we should. But I get startled by the Doody Woman who says "The Messiah has spoken and he said let my people go."  She thought she was funny.  So this was about 12:30ish and I was like YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!  I got a certificate and walked out the door.  I should have went back to work probably... who knows.  But I didn't.  Now I dont have to Doody until 2 more years... haha.  So thats my doody story.  Its time for me to leave work now.  Over and out Doody.

      Okay, my turn for an update on the weekend.... Friday night--- I went over to Amandas at 11:30pm and we went to Walmart and I bought some hair dye to do my highlights.  We waited and waited in line, I felt like we were in the twilight zone all the waiting we did with all of these weird people just standing still in these lines not saying a word... can you imagine a Walmart quiet?  Yeah, that's why I felt like I was in the twilight zone.  So then we made a run to WaWa after where I got a cappucino to keep me awake...(By this time it is Saturday) Then I attempt to highlight the hair after a while, I wanted caramel highlights and it gave me red... go figure, but people SAY they like it anyway.  I didn't get home till about 3:15 or so and then watched an episode of the 2nd Real World on my Comcast Favorite Channels Selection.  It reminds me of when I was young when I watch that stuff... I also slept on my couch cause every Saturday morning I plan on sleeping in, but I never can cause the sun shines so bright into my room and I wake up early all the time.  So in my living room it isn't as bad... but I would only do this on a Friday night.  But, needless to say, I still woke up at 10 after going to bed at 4am.  Oh well.  Saturday evening I went to a "social" gathering at Dave and Audra's with the "College and Career" class at my church... we ate, played Catch Phrase and then watched Bruce Almighty... oh yeah, can't forget the Cicada Video.  Sunday I went to church and to a "re-commitment" ceremony for a couple that has been married 50 years from Bethany.  That's so cool, I hope I get to be married to my future husband for that long... or ever longer.  Then I came back for prayer meeting and then went to Red Robin with friends... Then back to the Baileys where we played some Text Twist of course and around 12:30ish watched "How to Win a Date with Ted Hamilton"  Not sure why we did that... Then it was 3am.    Monday, me and Fay had some lunch at her house, went and saw "Man on Fire" with our man Denzel... we gotta see every Denzel movie.  It was really good... go watch it.  Then we went to the mall, got T some gifts for her birthday... Ate back at the Doughtens, a magnificent feast as always.  Then went and visited there cousin David in the hospital b/c his foot is infected.  Then came back and helped T a little with some work and Mrs. D. a little some with Vacation Bible school stuff.    Kind of a non-interesting blog wouldn't you say?  All my creative juices are drained out.  But, let me just say, that I got here at the exact same time as the project assistant did and she left 40 minutes ago and I am going to leave in 20 minutes cause that's what we are supposed to do.  If we get here at 8, we stay till 4:30, not 3:30!!!!!  She makes her kids an excuse, so if they are an excuse then she should get here at 7:00am instead.  :)  Ha. Just a thought.    And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

       Well, work has been boring... my manager is on vacation and all I do is watch the time change.&nbsp; I acutally do more than that... but Im just so darn good at what I do that I get it done within an hour of me being at work.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Sorry for the lack of posts.&nbsp; The only reason I am posting now is b/c my brother is posting this on his  urlLink site  he is almost finished with.&nbsp;   Supposedly he is amost done, but who knows.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Oh and by the way- HAPPY BIRTHDAY RYAN!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Okay, well I am really excited b/c I leave for vacation really soon... 12 of my friends from Nashville are coming up on my  urlLink friends  tour bus   and we're all staying in OCNJ for a week!&nbsp; Well I know mostly all of them except for&nbsp;four... so hopefully I will get to make some more friendships from the state of TN.&nbsp; But I am saying no to being in anymore weddings there... haha.&nbsp; They opened up an account for this trip and now there is a debit card that has all of our money in it.&nbsp; So when its time to do something we just whip out the card and its payed for!&nbsp; I wouldn't have thought of that... it's a whole lot easier then trying to gather 12 peoples money together every time we all do something... so anyway, it should be tons of fun.&nbsp; We are staying real close to the boardwalk too... never done that before.&nbsp; Then after that week I am at the beach with my momma, Ry and Beth... and some few others here and there of course.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Tonight I volunteer with the DBA (Delaware Baptist Association) at the Wilmington Games.&nbsp; It should be neat.&nbsp; We set up tents and pass out water and then have certain items to give out as witnessing opportunities to share Christ with others.&nbsp; Tonight its at Baynard Stadium.&nbsp; Im also volunteering Saturday as well... not sure where that one is at, but of course its somewhere in Wilmington. :-P&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The thought of moving to Nashville again is still up in the air.&nbsp; Anytime I talk to anyone there thats the first thing they mention- me moving there... and then I go on about how Im not sure b/c its such a hard decision... if only it were closer... i mean, even 4 hours would be fine... but Im not sure about being 14 hours away from people I love.... but I guess Im doing the same thing by being here and having friends in TN... anyway...&nbsp;&nbsp;       Hmmmm... what else... okay here is a stupid joke my friend told me:&nbsp; What is 6 feet long and has one tooth?&nbsp;  Dont know?&nbsp; I'll tell ya--- The funnel cake line at a fair in West Virginia.&nbsp;    Stupid I know.&nbsp; Kinda funny though.     &nbsp;   Oh and Im super excited to be an Aunt.&nbsp; Am I allowed to say that?&nbsp; Oh I dont care anymore... how in the heck am I supposed to keep that in?&nbsp; Im actually used to keeping that&nbsp;secret in&nbsp;and not telling anyone that once I was given "permission" to tell I still didn't tell anyone b/c I was so used to holding it in!!!!!!!&nbsp; I even held back from getting a card and gift b/c I didnt want to&nbsp;reveal the secret and I've gone this long and still havent gotten one b/c Im so used to holding it in!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not good with this whole secret thing... but I guess Im getting too good at it...     &nbsp;   Oh, I watched the Truman Show last night after Bible study.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I watched some of it b/c my Bible Study doesnt get over till late so I didn't get it started till 10:30.&nbsp;&nbsp; That movie is slower than what I remembered but it is still interesting.&nbsp; I kinda fell asleep... but the other two I was watching it with definitely fell asleep so I decided to leave and sleep in my own bed.&nbsp;   Alright, well could I have bored you enough with useless information?&nbsp; Hope you all have a blessed day...    Not to us, but to His name be the glory.     &nbsp;   Meg     &nbsp;   Oh and the name of my title is a Christian group I saw on Sunday night... it was a youth centered event... but some adults... anyway, the first half of the show I was wondering why in the world I was there... but then the lead singer gave his testimony in between and automatically I knew why God had me stay... then praise and worship at the end is always uplifting... but crazy name for a bunch of 30 something year old men apart of a band huh?&nbsp; I was thinking it had something maybe to do with that they are being used by God... He is the master puppeteer and every move and decision they make is being controlled by Him... who knows, but I like that analogy :-P&nbsp; Its probably some inside joke or something... anyway, grace and peace.&nbsp;     &nbsp;
