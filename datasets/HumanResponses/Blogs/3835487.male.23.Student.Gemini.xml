      The fact that I have not posted for about ten days is evidence to that.     So what's been up with me you ask? Not a whole lot. Just been working on my paper and hanging out, going to movies, etc. Same old, same old. My boy Bobby now has a  urlLink blog . Go check it out. He's probably more creative than I am with mine.     I guess I can talk about movies galore. Perhaps I should just turn this into a movie review site, because that's mostly all I talk about. This weekend I saw both "Harold and Kumar Go to Whitecastle" and "Bourne Supremacy." First, "Harold and Kumar." This movie is hilarious. Go see it now. Although it seems to run a bit long at the end, it is worth it. Any movie where Neal Patrick Harris plays himself, steals a car, does drugs, and gets strippers has to be funny. Not to mention the fact that it has the MILF guy from "American Pie" and the assistant guy from "Van Wilder" as its stars. When I originally saw the preview I thought this movie would be completely stupid, but it is far funnier than "Dodgeball" and funnier than "Anchorman." I won't ruin anything, but again, I will highly recommend it.     "Bourne Supremacy" was kind of a disappointment. I was unaware that it had a different director from the first movie until Smith told me halfway through, which explained the chaotic style in which the film was shot. This chaos takes away from the car chases and fight scenes because it is hard to tell what is going on. I feel like they wasted some really cool stunts with the bad camera work. I understand that directors feel that this camera style is a really cool thing to do now and adds to the "action feel" of a movie but I've never cared for it. Also, I just felt like this movie was almost filler to get the series to the third film. I know it was based on a book so it shouldn't feel that way, but it does. I don't know if they are planning on ending with three films or not, but I hope they do four instead. Not because I'm really excited to see two more of these movies, but because everything is a trilogy now so maybe they should change it up. Think about all the trilogies out there.     Speaking of trilogies, the new "Star Wars" film is entitled "Revenge of the Sith." It's actually a pretty good title. Obviously, it's better than the last two cheesy titles.     Waco is getting an Alamo Draft House. I can't tell you how much that rules. It will bring a different kind of crowd and different kinds of movies. Not only will it be cool to see art films and whatever else they will show, but it will also be cool to make fun of all the weirdos who never left the house before the Draft House opened. I guarantee you all the dorks of Waco will congregate there. Apparently they are also developing land across from the "awesome" new Central Texas Marketplace into another shopping center. I'm hoping that we get a digital theater now since the theaters here still run on film which tends to lead to some sort of problem every time I see a movie.     Not much else has been going down. My parents are gone so I am still housesitting and bored out of my mind. I feel very cooped up sometimes. It's not like I don't get out but it's still frustrating. I think they come back this week but I am unsure since my dog ate their itinerary. She also ate one of my PS2 controllers, and those things are expensive.     Oh, and I think I talked to a member of the Roots on the phone last night, but I am unsure about it. It was very strange.     Peace Out.    Alex

      No seriously, why do I? Last night, given hundreds of choices, I chose to order "Cruel Intentions 3." It was much better than "Cruel Intentions 2." The gay dude from "Dawson's Creek" was the main role, and then I hadn't seen any of the other actors, except this one girl who looked super familiar to me. I IMDB'ed the movie, and turns out her only other role was on "Joe Schmo!" Now THAT is funny....two lifetime roles. Hey, she's probably doing better than most of the other people from that show.     How come the "Real World: Shit they should have shown" was much better than the actual real world season? And why do they give away how they completely blow everything out of proportion on the actual show by showing the context that surrounds it? It seems to defeat the purpose. Oh well, at least I found out Jacquese had a date. Even if she was under 18.     More media..."Anchorman" was hilarious. On the "Eurotrip comedy scale," I'd say it was a little funnier than "Eurotrip." Will Ferrell goes overboard half the time, but the guy from "Daily Show" and the cameos more than make up for it. AND Ben Stiller actually said something funny. AND Christina Applegate is actually in a real move. COMO ESTAN BEETCHES? TONIGHTS TOP STORY-- THE SEWERS RUN RED WITH THE BLOOD OF RON BURGUNDY...I LOVE LAMP! (If you don't know what all these means, get off your ass and go see the movie. It's better than crappy "Dodgeball," and you all just loved that movie, didn't you!)     NCAA 2005 is out. I'm a bit disappointed. I haven't even played it that much, and usually I'm obsessed. The gameplay seems the exact same but harder-- the computer's zone defense is always perfect so it's harder to pass. At least the animations look realistic. The "celebration" feature is completely lame, however. Create-a-sign and all that new stuff is cool, but it's just not what I expected. I still like it though. Haven't gotten to recruiting yet, because I'm not like Ryan and don't build dynasties all day long (Landry comment, because Landry accused Ryan of playing video games all day long, sparking a verbal fight on my birthday.)     My dog threw up a lot the other day but is now doing better. Apparently she eats all kinds of plants in the backyard and it gives her infections. Now I have to leash her when I take her out, which sucks, because she loves the backyard, but she has to learn not to make herself sick. Needless to mention, I used up an entire bottle of Nature's Miracle getting the vomit smell out of the carpet. It was the equivalent of a human having food poisoning.     Rob is still trying to diss my blog. Go to his  urlLink blog  and see how crappy it is! It's just him arguing with his sister! Feel free to tell him if you are a registered user. At least I don't post about Thunderbird's biatch! Oh, and my computer is better than yours. I doubt you'll upgrade because you want to keep your 500mhz or whatever it is so you have an excuse not to get owned on Doom 3 by me son! Eat that! This blog war has escalated!     Well, I can't really think of anything else for now. Take it easy.     Peace out,   Alex

      So I found out that I have to write a 20 page paper this month. That blows. It's going to be helpful though in the long run because it will help form my lit review for my thesis. Sounds pretty boring, huh? Don't want to bore anybody with talk of my thesis, so moving on...it's just cool to say things like "my thesis" beacuse I sound more educated.  My parents are leaving Tuesday for two weeks to go to Canada for vacation. So far living at home for this year is working out nicely, they don't bother me too much. It'll be nice to have some time alone though. I think I'll try and invite some ladies over if you know what I'm saying. At 23 years old, I can use the line, "so, my parents are out of town..." Classic. I feel like a kid again. But seriously, I'm going to have a great party! I'm going to invite over my prostitute girlfriend and she's going to bring all her prostitute friends with her! We'll then get all the guys I know over here, charge for sex, and I get to take money for the house! What a great entrepruenerial scheme old chap!  My dog is teething. Dog bites hurt. Glad she bites my parents instead of me...oh wait they are going out of town, crap.  I'm going on vacation in August to Destin, FL. Ryan and hopefully some other people will go-- who really wants to be stuck with that just that TOOL on a vacation alone, that would blow! Too bad Landry is an ass and is going with a non-girlfriend girl to Florida instead of us, I thought we was boys Landry!!  Anyways, that's enough for now. Shoutout to Rob, my blog kicks your blog's ass.   Peace.  Alex

      First off, I'm not going to bold stuff anymore. It was funny at first, but now I realize it's too much trouble. So deal.  All kinds of things have gone on as of late. On the fourth I had a cookout with Smith and Kristin. We swam and then watched the amazing Waco fireworks. Actually, they were over thirty minutes long this year, which turned out to be a bad thing. I used to complain that they were too short. After thirty minutes of the same firework over and over it gets pretty boring. I'd say 18 minutes is an optimal firework display time.  Today I saw the movie  King Arthur . It did not get the best reviews, but I really enjoyed it. The reviewers claim that the film lacks emotion, but I guess reviewers today require cheesey or over-the-top emotion in their films, because this film had a good amount of emotion. Just because somebody wasn't yelling "FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM" at the end doesn't mean something lacks emotion. Word.  tomorrow I must go to class. I don't actually know if the professor will be there. Hopefully she will not. She has been off in the Ukraine and has yet to return. Oh well.   Ma$e has returned to the rap game! But this time he's sober. That translates into bad rap music. It's a requisite that rappers smoke weed. It's not my personal choice but if they ain't doin' it, I'm not listening.   I have decided that going out to bars sucks now. Especially in Waco. I think I've lost a lot of interest in drinking, it's never fun when I go out to bars. Especially when you see the same lame Waco people over and over again. Perhaps I am growing up. I'd rather just relax or hang out with friends. I don't need no alcohol to get my kicks.   That's all for now. Holla.   Alex

      The  highlight  of my day was watching  Spiderman 2 . I don't know what that says about my life...perhaps I really enjoy movies or nothing exciting happened to me today so a movie is the best I have to offer. Anyway, I thought the movie was  great . I don't know if it quite lives up to the  hype  that surrounds it, but it's definitely one of the best things that I've seen in a while. People are calling it the best action movie ever, but I don't really see it as an action movie, it has more of a human element to it. An action movie to me is something like  The Transporter . I would recommend this movie and go so far as to say that it's the best movie that I've seen in a while, but like I said, I don't know if anything can live up to a  97 percent  on  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes . The only downside of the movie is that the  Green Goblin  will be back in the next one. I think they should keep it fresher than that, but maybe they will prove me wrong. That, and the fact that  Hal Sparks  was in the movie for about twenty seconds during an elevator ride.  Since when is  Lance Armstrong  dating  Sheryl Crow ? I gotta think that's a pretty good score for him. I'd like to see a picture of his  ex-wife  just for comparison...  Has anyone ever noticed how  fantasy sports  get boring about halfway through? It's like I'm just going through the motions now on my baseball team. I much prefer playing   urlLink City of Heroes  . My character,  Mesocyclone , is now a Level 14 defender. That's about 47 hours of playing time. Just for your information, she manipulates the weather and radiation. I think I need to get out more or something. I always used to make fun of people who played  Everquest  all day but now I'm no different. Well...I'm still different because I don't play ALL day...maybe 2 hours a day.   Apparently  NASCAR  couldn't find a better grand marshal for their race than  Byron Leftwich . I mean he's a good QB, but has he really reached  grand marshal status ? Or even Waco Marshal status?  That's it for now. Next time will be better. I  promise .  Peace.  Alex

       urlLink    Charley, you son of a...  urlLink     So this hurricane Charley is threatening Florida...Coincidentally, it's a few days before my vacation...that would be just my luck. It looks like it will be long gone by Monday, but you never know. The real loser in all this is Justin Landry who will be traveling to Florida on Saturday! In the words of Ryan, "I NEED THIS VACATION MAN." So hopefully, it will be long gone!  Congrats to Charlene, Rob's loving g/f, who got a new job! You should hook me up with some discounts on some sweet merchandise...or just give me the five finger discount. And Rob,  Andromeda Strain  is a really good book, I don't know what you're talking about. One post you say it's amazing, one post you say it's not that good...quit being a flip-flopper! And I still expect a new copy of  The Great Train Robbery . After nine years I'd almost forgotten, but now it's on. You don't screw with me and live to tell about it!!  Nothing else much going on here. A film recommendation...watch  The Last Picture Show . Yes, it is somewhat dated, but it is one of the AFI's best pictures of all-time, and with good reason. One of the best films I've seen in a long time, I can't believe I hadn't seen it before.  That's all for now...this is probably my last post before Florida, so perhaps I will come back with some debacle-esque stories. Crazy times!!!!!  Peace, Alex

       urlLink    The flow...  urlLink     I saw that  urlLink B-O-B-B-Y (why ask why)  posted his own album review of Ghostface's new one, so I thought I'd put up a recent album that I have enjoyed so far...it's The Roots album,  The Tipping Point . Go and check it out. These guys are on a whole other level from most of the popular hip-hop out there these days. I can't really explain it...their music is a synergy of a lot of different things...hip-hop, rock, jazz, soul, etc...and they know how to flow. I don't even want to say anything because I don't think I can give them due credit. I also got the  The Pretty Toney Album ...Bobby's pretty much on with his review of that one. And for the record, I could have won that game if I wanted to. 'Nuff said.  Keep talking and I'll be in the SA at your doorstep with a beating to hand out...I wouldn't want to have to hurt you, man!!

      Well, it is 3:47 a.m., and I have finally finished my paper! No doubt a relief to all who are reading...I have nothing to say here because I am all written out for the night...oh, and Bobby, just remember, in that game of NCAA where you beat me...all I had to do was play for real and I would have held my massive lead...I chose to make it interesting and it bit me in the ass as usual...so don't make up some lies about how you "dominated" me! Next time, I'm running the ball with :19 left and the lead instead of throwing off the back foot of the awful Marcus Vick!!!  PPPPPPPPPPPPPeace, Alex

      Another tax free weekend has come and gone, and boy did I cleeeeeeean up...I bought a total of 150 dollars worth of stuff on Saturday from the mall...do you realize that I saved 12 dollars?! Do you!? And if you throw in the 20 dollars I ripped out of the lady at the collectibles shop (she was selling comics and baseball cards for a cut rate, what a moron!), I saved 32 dollars! You can't put a value on the X-Men, now can you? And someday, those Pujols cards will be my ticket to retirement, I tell you...Sotheby's (sp?) here I come! On a sidenote, does anyone remember that cartoon on MTV like 10 years ago called Aeon Flux? Well, she really looks like Psylocke of the X-Men. I think that they copied her look. And if this has fallen too much into dork-related territory, please let me know. I am 23 years old, I think.  Just a week till Destin. I can already feel the sand between my feet...now if I can only make it through my paper. I'm on page 12...only 6 left, I'm aiming to finish tommorow so I have a few days to chill before my sister comes to visit. I enjoy seeing my relatives but it becomes a hassle when people stay for longer than 2 days...luckily, I'll be in Florida for most of the time. I just hope my dog does not attack my 3-year-old niece TOO much... and on a sidenote, I hope there are some attractive girls down there, is that too much to ask for?  This update was to appease the masses. Not much intelligent thought is left in my brain tonight, as evidenced by this post. I'm talking about the X-Men for heaven's sake. And on an angering note, I was alerted by Smith that there may not be an  X-Men 3 ...unlike tax free weekend, this revelation really HAS rocked me to the core...in fact, so much that I may just go into hiding all together.  Peace. Alex

      The other day when I was reading my boy urlLink  Bobby's blog , I realized that I've been shuffling about with the same sort of thoughts that he has been having, except in reverse. Lately I'm wondering what all this extra schooling is for. I've learned virtually nothing about the practical application of journalism, which is what I want to do. What good is a master's degree going to do me in the real world? I mean, basically, all I've turned into is a research drone doing the same things that I did in undergrad only on a larger scale. Don't get me wrong, I realize I'm lucky to have such an opportunity at my fingertips, but I just can't see where it is getting me. Perhaps I'm just venting due to this impending-thesis-state-of-mind, but sometimes I wish I'd have gotten a degree in landscaping or computers, hell even in counseling so I could counsel teenagers or do something helpful in the world, something of substance, or at least something where my degree has practical application. If I get a job as a writer these feelings will wash away, but if not, I'll be "up shit's creek with paddles this deep." And yes, I realize that school is better than working at a job that I don't like, but sometimes it's just hard to see what the point of it is...  But enough about me. Tonight I saw  Collateral . I was very excited to view this film. Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has let me down again. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was well acted, but the script suffered from boredom. You get the same old philosophizing and plot that you see in countless movies-- I'm crazy because my dad was an alcoholic and beat me, I lived in an orphanage, I'm paired up with an uptight guy and I teach him to be wild and crazy and in the end it comes back to bite me in my ass! Trust me, if you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. The thing is, Cruise and Foxx are so good they make the hackneyed dialogue  sound  good, but don't be fooled. I guess my  Village  experience had me wary going into this one. For some reason, I felt like I was watching an English television drama-- the movie was filmed so that it looked like one of those. You know, like that show on MTV  Undressed . It just wasn't filmed so that it looked like a normal movie. And someone please explain to me the symbolic meaning of the coyote in the middle of Los Angeles-- did Vincent feel like that was him, out of place, all alone in the world? Just a warning, the movie is not like the trailer, it's very slow moving! Enough about that...  Larry Walker is a Cardinal! That should put to rest all the pundits saying the Cubs have a better lineup than the Cardinals. I'm sick of hearing that, as far as I'm concerned, their lineup was better without Walker, but now its leagues ahead. Walker is a career .300 hitter and not just a product of Coors Field. Nomar is not some kind of cure-all for the Cubs, and so far he's batting something like .211. He can't even play everyday due to his injuries. We'll see who wins in the end...  Lit review update...3 pages down, 15 to go. I better go now so I can knock some more off, gonna try to get it down to 13 or 12 to go by the time I go to bed...guess that means no PS2.  Peace out, Alex

      Today about 7:30 am I was called to the scene of an attempted murder by my dog, Zoe, on a creepy little opossum in the backyard. Luckily I got there before she could attack, needless to say she was in her hunting crouch mode. It would have been bad if she had of attacked, because despite being nearly blind, them sunbitches is meaner 'en hell (as we would say in Oklahoma). But seriously, have you ever checked out a opossum up close? It's freaking creepy. This thing moved very slowly and I shit you not, walked straight up one side of the chain link fence and then straight back down the other. It was like the terminator of blind marsupial (it is one of those, right?).  Lit review update...17 1/2 of 18 pages to go! I'd say 1/2 a page is some sweet progress for one day! I'll try and hit a page before I go to sleep. And guys, I'm out blogging you. Rob I haven't seen shit on your blog since the ferret post, and Bobby, you copied my Q Carter post because you were devoid of any other topics to write about! You guys have been checkmated by my superior blogging abilities. Peace for now.  Alex

      Bobby suggested that I do a link of the day because I always send him cool links. Well Bobby, here's my first (and perhaps last) attempt at it:  urlLink  Trev Alberts is a moron .  Bonus Link:  urlLink MLB Walkup music .  The fact Jim Edmonds walkup song is "Tipsy" kills me. I don't know why, he just doesn't seem like a "Tipsy" type of guy.  And yes, not all my links will refer to sports. Just today. Think of it is a theme! Great!  Peace, Alex

      Film-- Veronica Guerin. Honestly, I just like this because I'm an aspiring journalist and it shows that journalists  can  do good despite popular opinion. It's probably not the best film, but interesting nonetheless.  Song--  "Backdoor Lover" from the movie  Josey and the Pussycats  I know this is really random and devoid of value, but I was flipping channels the other day and saw this song on the movie. I'd forgotten how funny it was.  Book--  Young, Black, Rich & Famous  by Todd Boyd Talks about racism &amp; stereotypes in modern day basketball. I read it for my thesis, and while I want to quote the book just about every other paragraph, I don't know if the people at Baylor will like it. You see, Dr. Boyd combines the language of the academic with the language that he learned growing up as a black male, and it makes for interesting reading. In fact, I was blown away by some of the stuff in the book-- remember Rasheed Wallace talking about being a slave for white owners? The book talks about this very subject...

      So today I found out that Quincy Carter was cut by the Cowboys. First off, it's important to note that I have virtually no interest in any of the other NFL teams and watching any other NFL game besides one involving Dallas usually bores me to tears. The Cowboys are one of the few Texas ways of life that I have adopted in my 19 years here. But back to Quincy. I've always thought he had great potential and could end up being a good QB for the Cowboys, so I was really looking forward to watching him play this year. It turns out, according to television reports, that he tested positive for cocaine. When I heard drugs, I assumed roids or weed, but looking at him and seeing that he was pretty skinny I decided it had to be weed. But cocaine? While it sucks that he was doing that drug, it surely explains a whole lot and points to a bright future for him! I mean seriously, think about it. He was so damned erratic out there. One time he'd throw a great rope to a WR on an out route, but the next time he'd attempt to pass the ball and it would literally fall behind him. He was on and off...almost like a person who uses coke a lot! Perhaps he was like DH from  Playmakers  and constantly had to get his fix before the game. If he can really rehab and get off the stuff, he might be really good in the future! Too bad stuffy old Bill Parcells cuts someone if they are a minute late to practice...I mean come on, it's JUST cocaine! That's enough sports talk for now.  I saw  The Village  last night. I figured out the plot halfway through, but while watching it I enjoyed it a great deal. Then, I got home, and began to think about the movie. I realized that I was duped partially by great camera work, I think. While the movie is shot in a way that is quite pleasing, the premise, as Roger Ebert expounded in his review, is laughable. Even before I went to bed I was still thinking about the movie, and thinking that I liked it. I woke up at 5 a.m. in a cold sweat, and the first thing that came to my mind was "that movie sucked." I still can't completely explain how I was manipulated into thinking it was a good movie while I watched it, but I was. M. Night needs to do better than this next time.  I think he's a director who is still living off the fact that he made one really good movie.  I just started working out again for the first time in 3 weeks, and man is it painful. I've got to stop getting out of shape. The prospect of being on a beach in two weeks has made me workout again. Fortunately, I assume that the only people in Destin in two weeks will be old people, thus minimizing embarrassment. On the brightside, working out at home I don't have to deal with the various douchebags that populate the gym at school. Unfortunately, I also don't get to see hot girls. Oh, well.  Well, back to working on my lit review that's due next week. Only 18 of 18 pages to go!  Peace out! Alex  P.S. I'll try to blog more.
