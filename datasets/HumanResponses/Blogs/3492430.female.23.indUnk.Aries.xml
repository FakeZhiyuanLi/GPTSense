      I am very tired because today was quite busy.This was my first Memorial day,and the day most hot.Now,I know than the summer is caming.But,I want to write about my day.I woke up very early,and I organized my room,cleaned my clothes and finished my homework.At 2:00 pm,I ate rice with vegetables than we cooked out in the grill.The food was delicious.I ate out side and Iwas watching the children than they were swimming in the pool.I didn't want to swim yet because I was very good in side the house with the air conditioning.So,I was with the children to play.After that,my friend's mother picked me up to buy same presents for another friend.But first,we went to picked up Dulce,my friend,her work.When she was ready,we went to eat fish and to buy presents for her brother which he is my friend.We found a lot of things than he need,but we needed to decide the best thing,and I think than we did a good job.But,I can't say anything because he can see my blog and that will be a big problem.This was my afternoon.In the evening,I met with other friends to watch a movie in their house.We had popcorn,cookies and ice cream.We passed a fantastic time together.I like these moments bacause I can try to speak english.This was my day.The word most important in this day was HOT!!!!! Good night babies!

      Yesterday I had the opportunity to call my best friend from Spain.Her name is Beatriz,but she likes that everyone call her Bea.So,I called Bea bacause she wrote me an e-mail where she said that she will come to U.S from Jun 28th until July 30th.Consequently,I am so happy because she will come to visit me her in Dallas the last week of July.The new has been a big surprise to me because I haven't seen her since last year ,and I can wait to come those days.We have known since we were child,and we always did things together like to play with barbies or with other friends.Moreover,we were the best friends when we were between 13 and 15 years old;In another words,when we were teenagers.We went to campaments together,and we liked to go to my house or her house and to rent a movie,to cook and to enjoy the day.I remember when she played the piano and both sang.I loved that time,and I miss so much it.In addition,She is a great player of piano.In another hand,she is the best player that I have known in my life,she is able to play everything that she likes or she listens.She can make everything that she will want to do too.I miss a lot her,but now I very excited to know that she will come here.Then,I talked with her for a long time yesterday,and we spoke about our lives now.She finished to study laboratory which was a course about medicene,I think that she did some place like college here.And after that,she practiced it in a famous hospital of our city.Now,she is doing her dreams which is to come to U.S.I am very happy because she has achived to be true her dreams like mine.I say that because to come to U.S had been our dreams since we were teenagers,but we couldn't do together because I had a grate opportunity to come here the last year which I did.So,now it is her opprotunity,and finally we will live our dream together in U.S.In conclusion,I had a fabulous weekend with one of the best new that I have had. I hope that your weekend were as fantastic as mine. Your friend,Vane.

      I can believe that I have been here 1 year,but I am happy because I feel very well like in my house.This weekend was very relaxing after the hard week that I had.The friday was the most relaxing day because I was in my house to sunbathe,and I cooked my dinner.At 10:30,I went to the movie with my boybriend, his sister and his mother,and we saw "The Terminal".It was very funny.So,this was the friday.On saturday,we had the idea to make a barbecue and to swim in the pool,but we had a big problem.The day rose very pretty,so we went to my house to prepare everything that we will need when the sky began to change quite quickly,and the day was dark.It started to rain very strong,I was so scared.Moreover,I cooked some spanish food "tortilla de patata",and we ate and listened to music.When the storm stopped,I went outside because I needed to cut the grass.My friends and I did the grass,after that, we were swimming and playing in the pool because the water was very warm.We finished quite tired,but we decided to go to the movie again.This time,my boyfriend and I decided to watch "SHERK 2".This movie was great,I loved it so much.I had decided to call my classmates Eddi and Josei,but"I'M SORRY SO MUCH,"I didn't find their phone number.Now,I need to write in my adress book because this is a secure place.I feel very sad because I didn't do each thing that I said.This was just the worse thing that happened.Because on Sanday,It was my boyfriend's mother happy birthay.So,we bought steak on Saturday,and we make a barbecue this time.It was very good.But the best thing on Sunday was the concert of music of a singer from Spain.I didn't see it,but I recorded it.So,Today when I finish my class,I will see it.HEHEHEHEHE!!!! That was my weekend one more time,and now I need to go college. Bye,bye!!!

      I think that today has been very very bad until now.Firts of all,I am alone this week in my house because the family left to California the last Tusday.The firts days I was scared with the idea to sleep alone in this big house,but now I feel much better about this.I like the idea to stay alone in my house because I need time to me,and I like to enjoy of the calmness that there is in the house without children.Although,I miss their a lot.The house is not the same without my babies.But I would like to tell us why today was so bad for me.This morning I woke up at 8:00 p.m because I wanted to study for the second grammar test.So,I took a shower,and I was ready to go with Joseane and Eddi to study together.At 8:30,and I had been waiting Joseane when the police knocked the door of my house.I was quite nervous because I didn't know what was happenig.So,I openned the door because I didn't have any problem to ask what is happening.I want to say that they were very polite with me but that didn't mean that I was nervous.They asked me about what I was doing and where the family were???.I answered each question,and then I showed my ID from Spain and my ID from college.And this was all,I never asked which was the reason of their visite,and they never said me something like that.Joseane came to my house,and we went to her house to study grammar.I was very worry about every thing that I happened.I tried to study but I was very hard to concentrate just in grammar.We went to college,and we did the second test of grammar.After that the day has been very tired,and I could,t think an another thing that it was not grammar and more grammar.I don't know how I did my test but I hope that this event will affect in my score.Now,I am much better because I rest of this hard day.I am very grateful to have good friends and their great advise.Thank you very much.Now I go to visit my friend's new baby.I think that this is good for me to forget this day.Have a good weekend!!!!!

      I had never imagined that the day will change.I remember that the day was very pretty with a shiny sun and a magnificent blue sky.At 7:00 p.m,the sky started to change very quickly.So,at 9:00 p.m,when I was ready to write in my blog, the light started to turn off and turn on.Then,I decided to turn off my computer before than the light will turn off.I was very scared with the flashes of lightning and the thunders.When my computer was closing,the light turned off.I was quite scared, but most of all that I was not alone in the house.I hate when the weather get this way.In addition,I wouldn't do anything without light.Deanne was with me,and she was laughing at me.It didn't matter because the most important at that moment was that I was not alone.At 9:30 p.m,I went to my bed with a candel and a flashlight.I didn't feel sleppy, so I started to write in my personal journal about my last days.I wrote during one hour and half,and the light didn't arrived.I decided to go to sleep.I turned off my flashlight and my candel, and I closed my eyes very strong to not see the flashes of ligtning.I was tired, and I felt aslepp very quickly because I don't remember anything.When I woke up,I tried to turn on my stereo to listen music, but I had a big surprise.The light hadn't come yet!!!I took a shower,and I ate my brakfast.After that,I read to the children a short story in spanish because I try to teach Spanish to the family I am living with.At 11:00 a.m,I took my bus to college,but first I called the college to know if it everythings was well.Later,when I arrived to my house,I found than the light didn't was still not there.So,the night was coming,and we are without light one more night.I passed a good day because I was in the college and eveything was good,but the family passed a bad day without light.When I arrived,I felt very sad.This day and the night were quite bad to us, and we did't want to pass another night like the last one.We called to ask if someone will fix the light,but they said that the thunderstorm was too strong that they coulden't  fix the electricity this night.We could't do anything,so we were preparing to go to sleep when the light arrived.During all night,we didn't have any problem with the light.And finally,we went to bed very happy.These days,I knew how the light is important in our lives.When this things happened in our lives,we will appreciate much better.I hope than it won't happen another time. Good night and sweet dreams!

      This was my second time that I was here in the independent day.But there were very diferent.The last year I just came here 1 month ago,so I din't know nothing about what american people do in this special day.Then,I went with same friends that I did a few days before to a birthday party.I had a fun time with them.We ate hamburger and cake,and we also played and danced.But we never went to see the fireworks that are very famous here.Moreover,this year was so diferent.Firtly,my friends and I wnet to the church,and then I helped to Dulce,she is a special friend that I have known here,to cook because yesterday was her birthday.So,we cook a delicious mexican food,and we had a great time laugthing and talking.After the dinner,Dulce had her birthday cake,and we sang "Las mananitas",this a kind of song that mexican peolple sing in birthday party.But I didn't sing this song because I didn't know,so I just make a music.Finally,when we finished to eat,we had the opportunite to go and see the fireworks.I enjoyed a lot when I saw this kind of light and the sky with different colors.That was beautiful.I am also very grateful because they drove to diferent place to find the fireworks'place.Yerterday was a beautiful day.I hope that everybody had had a great day almost like me.Bye,bye friends!!

      I have several reason to say that today was wonderful.First,I saw the sun after theses weeks with too much rain.So,I have enjoyed of the pool and the pretty day.But the second reason has been much better because this one has four fantastic children who I love they so much.In other words,the family which I live with came back of theirs vacation,and I will be "alone" more.In addition,We woke up at 9:30 a.m,and all the girl went to my room and told me about what they did during theirs vacation.All came with a pretty color of skin because they had been in California.They told me that they had been in the beach and in Disneyland.I know that they had enjoyed a lot because when they were telling,theirs faces showed me these wonderful things that they had lived in these last weeks.So,today we passed a great day together.We were suwmming into the pool and playing with the barbies.I have had a qite time with my girls and my little "boyfriend" who is the baby of the family.He has come very very big and walking,and now he is 1 year old.I love him so much.I remember when I came here,and he had never borned yet.Now he is happy boy who has three beautiful sisters.I am very grateful for this family because they give me too much love. And,thanks for the present!!!!!!!!!!!!!I like it very much ;)
