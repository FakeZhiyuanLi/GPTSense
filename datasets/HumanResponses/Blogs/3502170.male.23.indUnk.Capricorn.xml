      Wow... what a day.. yesterday.. after a day of not eating (xcept 4 breakfast) we drop by at UPtown... dah lama ngidam ChikenChop... after few mins of eating we (me, amy, myma & wan) stroll along the various flea hawkers... dammit. wished i'd buy that flakjacket... other stuff was cool too.. but money-wise.. i just grab a Shrek2 vcd and a Bender sticker.. n both of that cost me 11 bucks... well... guessed that I'm not that money-wise huh?

      Ahhhhhh... what a day.... everwonder what it would be like if we lived on an island... with nobody else? yeah.. thats how i felt these past few days... not that nobody's there... just that i feel alone... Aghhh! hate that feeling... so... today i finished up(i hope) my work...   hmmm.... felt good after all that weekend rest... went to sg. Besi on friday, with Amy, Pian n Myma... after acquring some stuff from Sakura's former house... glad that Halila's there... i must say... i just cant stand watching that house goes empty... climbing the stairs nearly made me cried... ohh.. what memories that we had...  my bro.. Aki came on Sat.. bringing a HD filled with Friends season 10 *Yay!* sadly some of them needs some freakin' codec or something to make it work.. *dammit*... after that we went to Midvalley.. my bro wanted 2 buy a deuter *Whoa* travellers bag... and he bought a Dueter Companion bag that i think.. serves only to pack laptop n stuff.. n it cost 380 after 25% discount...   hmmm.. i trully missed my Sakura... my friends from class... everyone.. i missed those time... its been 5 years in UiTM... and knowing it has ended was the worst for me... i hope ill met them all.. someday...
