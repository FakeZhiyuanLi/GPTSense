      I made it to Alina's last night around 6:30 after a crazy day of flying...the crop duster we fly in and out of Canada makes for a wild and crazy ride.  I have approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes of flying in those planes left and there will be count down as soon as I get back on the plane on Sunday and fly back to Canada for one last time.  On Friday for a brief moment I saw my eyes flash before my eyes...half way to Seattle we were all enjoying our complementary drinks and snacks of peanuts and Detour bars when the captain comes on the speaker and asks that we all buckle up and that the flight attendant please take her seat because we are headed toward a bumpy ride...I have been on many flights and many of them have been bumpy and though I never enjoy it, I realize that this comes with the territory...but I have never experienced anything like the 2 minutes I did on flight 2399 on Friday.  I can not explain what happened in those brief moments but they will forever be ingrained in my mind.  Drinks flying...faint screams...plane dropping...eyes closed...white knuckles...and in the end I have the Merlot a lady across the isle behind me was enjoying just a few moments ago on the front of my pink shirt...and then, just as fast as the wild ride came...a strange stillness comes over the plane as we begin our decent into to Seattle...............

      It is official, before I head back to Chi town in February I will be stopping off in Vegas...of course the purpose of this trip is for a 'work conference' it should still be a great time.  I have never been to Vegas and really didn't have plans to go in the near future so it is a pleasant suprise.  I will be staying at the Mirage Hotel on the strip for 4 nights.  WOOHOOO!

      So I have hit week 2 of my Canadian adventure...my time here on a new clients site. My role was to be assisting with testing and documentation...today I was surprised to see that I was not only to be a part of the testing...I was to be ahead of the testing. Major change from what I heard on Thursday. Nothing like getting thrown in a room with 6 clients for 7 hours, it was great fun...or not. I did survive though and I'm sure I'm stronger because of it.  We left the office at 7:30 tonight and I felt guilty...how sad is it that after 11.5 hours I feel guilty for leaving work?? SERIOUSLY!  Anyhow, I didn't write yesterday but on our last day off we went to see 'Along Came Polly' (which was pretty good despite what critics say) and then drove around and checked out some of the scenery. All in all we had a great relaxing weekend. Checked out some restaurants here, except I really wanted Mexican and we could not find a Mexican restaurant anywhere around here. If anyone wants to open up their own Mexican restaurant I've got a great market for you.

      So I have done it, I missed my first daily post.  We all knew it was going to happen so at least its over with.  I actually did start typing on Thursday but all I could write about was the Extreme Makeover episode I was watching and I didn't feel it was really Blogworthy.  The last night I started again and I was playing MSN's Solitaire Showdown, writing, playing writing some more, playing some more so when I when to post I had timed out of my blogger session and after I signed in again it deleted my post...ahhhh, by then I was to tired to do anything about it.   So Thursday we actually got to leave at a decent time...6:45, it was so exciting.  We got Friday off because we had put 51 hours in before we even hit Friday.  We decided to explore Kamloops on Friday but due to snow and fog we didn't get to see much.  Today is pretty much the same although I think I may have seen the sun peaking through the fog.  I will have to wait and see.  I did make it to the mall and found some great deals...capri pants for 2.50 (thats Canadian...so even less in the US), no one can pass that up.    urlLink Here are some more pictures of Kamloops that I took today.

      I've missed my first post yesterday...I have to say that I did attempt to write but I was having bloggers block and couldn't think of anything to write about besides the Extreme Makeover show I was watching and it didn't seem blog worthy.  I got tired and lost hope so I decided that the day where I missed a post would have to come anyway.  So therefore I have missed my first post daily post. Today was our first work free day in Canada, well work free compared to the other days.  We had big plans to explore the region today, however we didn't get very far on account of weather.  It started out with some snow this morning and then we couldn't shake the fog.  As we drove down the street we couldn't even see the restaurants on the side of the road so we decided to pull in the mall and eat in the food court..A&W mmm, we don't have those around Chicago.  We drove around Kamloops trying to reach Walmart.  We could see it from the top of the mountain where are hotel was but as we drove down the roads twisted and turned...we ended up driving around 20 minutes before we found it.

      It has been 2 very long days....13 hours later I have returned to my hotel...exhausted, angry that I missed the third episode of the Apprentice (Why did the have to change it to Wednesday anyway????  )...not wanting to go to bed just because I know I will have to get up in the morning just to do the same thing all over again... 13 hours seriously?  It wouldn't be so bad if I had things to keep me busy for 13 hours but they don't.  I'm thinking tomorrow should be an early night because the other consultants are flying out and I have already gotten the 'Okay' from my boss to take Friday off so I'm very excited about that.  I also found out today that there is a chance I will get to go to Vegas for a 3 day conference for work...I could totally do a conference after getting back from here...and in Vegas at that.  The only bad thing is that I get home on the 7th of February and I would need to be in Vegas either on the 8th or the 9th.  Talk about quick turn around.  Welp, there's work to be done before bed...  urlLink Here's pictures of Kamloops from my hotel room:

      We landed safely in Canada about 8:00 pm local time.  The airport was 1/4 the size of Tri-cities Airport in Johnson City.  I am not even joking.  There was one baggage claim which was in the lobby which was also the one and only gate with the check-in and Hertz rental car counter. It is by far the smallest airport I have ever been in.  I couldn't help but laugh.  I solved the problem about the lack of Canadian money by hitting the 1985 ATM machine that was in the lobby/baggage claim/gate area and was lucky that there was one lonely cab waiting for me when I stepped outside.  I think the good Lord was watching over me.   I can't wait to get a good look at my surroundings but I will have to wait for another day.  It was dark when I landed last night, this morning it was foggy and I'm still at the office and its dark once again.  All I know is that the hotel is at a higher elevation then the office because there is snow up there and none here.  Surprisingly enough it doesn't get light until later then Chicago here.  When I woke up at 7 it was still pitch black out.  I wasn't expecting that, I flung open my curtains to see the landscape but I was sadly disappointed when all I could see was darkness..  From what I can tell it is beautiful and mountainess.  I am looking forward to my day off when I can get a good look at everything.  For now, it's 7:30, we haven't eaten dinner, I'm trapped in the office because we are 'sharing' rental cars and I want to go home.   I'm starving and have eaten every ounce of food in my bag, including left over carrot sticks and shortbread cookies I got on the plane yesterday.  I'm going to start getting cranky and I assure you that no one wants that...

        Its 9:33 central...7:33 mountain...i think mountain, I'm not really sure.  I'm in flight to Kamloops, British Columbia..man these plane trips would go by so much faster if I could surf the web...blog perhaps.  I am on a rickety old plane... that's really really loud...and very shaky...40 minutes and counting.  My flight to Seattle may have been the best flight I have ever had.  It was four hours, I often have time sitting still for 30 minutes but it didn't seem to bad today.  I had my new Gameboy SP to keep me occupied for most of the trip.  Our flight got into Seattle at sunset, I could only see clouds below us for most of the trip but about 40 minutes before we landed I started seeing mountains sticking through the clouds....at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me...after all, I had seen Iowa  3 hours ago and it was so far away and now these mountains peaks were right out my window...an amazing an awesome site.  Just happened that "I Can Only Imagine" came on during this amazing experience.  Made me think that I truly can 'only imagine'.  The pilot said one of them was Mt. St. Helen's.  I guess I wasn't sure what to expect (the biggest mountains I've ever seen were at good old Milligan College, and I thought those were awesome) but even the tips of these mountains peeking through the clouds during at sunset was surely a treat for anyone's eyes.   urlLink Click here to check out the pictures of the moutains in the clouds    I'm not really sure what to expect when I get to Canada...my game plan is to grab a cab to the hotel...however, it just dawned on me that Canadian Currency would be really helpful.  Guess I will figure that out once on the ground.

      I headed out shopping this afternoon with no intentions of going to Old Navy.  For some reason I felt myself gravitating towards the store for no apparent reason (after all I am still bitter towards them for changing the style of my favorite low rise boot cut jeans...they no longer fit like a glove...they now have a 2 inch gap in the back...girls you know what I mean).  Anyhow, I find myself strolling the isles, checking out the latest fashion fads, thawing my hands and ears from the Chicago winter blasts.  Head towards the clearance section, for those who know me, know I can't pass up a good bargain.  Grab a few pairs of jeans that are on sale, knowing that none of them will fit but decide I will try them on anyway...when I spot a familiar face...one I hadn't seen in about 7 years...never the less the face hadn't changed.  A girl I went to high school with, and a cheerleader at that (yes, I'm stereotyping here I realize that but this is my blog and I can do that if I want).  Her locker was 2 away from mine for 6 years, she was always nice enough, but just enough for that 2.4 minutes we would see each other between each passing period...beyond that I wouldn't know, we weren't exactly in the same social circle.  And now, here we are, 41 miles from that high school in the same store...except I'm shopping with the well earned money that I receive from my job in the corporate world and she is stocking shelves.  Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against people that stock shelves...I like when stores are neat and shirts are all folded nice...I don't see myself as any better than those stocking shelves, but still for some reason I can't help but smirk as I head to the register to pay for the pair of jeans I got on clearance that actually fit...and to think, I'm not even sure why I went in the store in the first place.  Does anyone else find it ironic that the word Blog is not in the Blogger dictionary and its picked up on spelled check every time????

      People have often told me that journaling is a great way to capture your thoughts...I have never been one to journal though.  Not that I haven't made attempts.  I buy cute journals and fun pens thinking it will inspire me to write on a regular basis...I write the first day...maybe the second then I forget for another week, write another day then never pick it up again.  I can not even tell you how many times this has happened to me in the past.  I failed to see why anyone would make such a big deal out of journaling...but I think I have figured it out...it wasn't that I disliked journaling, its that I hadn't found the right medium...my life has been changed, my eyes have been opened...I have seen the light.  I finally have a place to put those thoughts that go through my head...the conversations I have with myself...without feeling crazy.  The only problem is now everyone else KNOWS I'm crazy.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't a secret in the first place though...and it turns out that even though i started this so people could keep tabs of me while traveling, it has been more therapy for myself then anything else. True this is only my first week...I still have plenty of time for failure...but I believe this may be record for me...and I'm still excited about it and I look forward to what will end up on the page each day.

      Some of you know that I it won't be long before I leave for Canada.  My company has decided to give me the privilege of spending 3 all inclusive weeks with our cold friends to the north.  And though I would rather go in the spring or summer I am actually quite excited to go.   During this time I will not be able to come home because my total one way trip will probably be around 9 hours (that's including lay overs).  I will be spending one weekend with Alina Best (a near and dear friend, please check out her awesome drawings at  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/alinaestherbest/   in Portland.  Since the farthest west I have been is Wichita,Kansas I can assure you I am very excited about my little adventure.   So none of that really has to do with what I intended to post on today...anyway, I have picked up another interesting yet possibly embarrassing habit the past couple of weeks.  For some reason I can not simply refer to our neighbors to the North as 'Canada'...on more than one occasion I mix the words Canadian and Canada therefore it comes out as Canadia.  The first time I did it, I laughed and joked with my parents in the comfort of their home...the next time I was with co workers at work...slightly more embarrassing but still forgivable...what next?  With my Canadian co-workers???  Or worse...Customs?  'Yes I will be staying in Canadia for the next 3 weeks'...

       urlLink Randomness  Three post in two days, please don't get use to this.  I am setting myself up for failure...and if you continue to check this site, a lifetime of disappointment.   Its 12:14, I'm at work, eating a steak burrito and having a Mountain Dew, listening to internet radio, blogging, anxiously awaiting my Gameboy Advance SP that I am picking up tonight and I suddenly realize to my horror that I am a geek.  True, this shouldn't be a new thing, I have often called myself this in the past, never really believing it though.    I feel now there is no denying it it...the signs are all there.  If it walks like a geek, talks like a geek, chances are...its a geek.  Who said that's a bad thing though? I have noticed through my recent blogging and e-mails (maybe you have also)...that I have picked up a horrible habit...how and when this started I'm not sure...Why can't I just use normal punctuation?  I have no idea...I have no intentions of stopping because like most habits...I quite enjoy it.................

       During the holiday season I received a phone call from an ex-boyfriend...lets call him Rob...not only did he call...he happened to call while my new flavor was sitting next to me on the couch.  I decided to forego the conversation as it wasn't the best time to take a call from my ex. After checking my voice mail later that evening I discovered that B...Rob had a Christmas present for me in which he was hoping to drop off.  Luckily, I was able to head off any meetings of the exes during the hustle and bustle of the holidays.   Christmas has come and gone, the new year has been rung in, the flavor has lost its taste and I was yet to receive my Christmas present from Rob.  So we met yesterday for old time sake.  The long awaited Christmas present, received during our lunch break...a book, 'The Hobbit' actually, which I hadn't asked for.  He said he had hoped that 'I hadn't picked it up yet'...I hadn't...the copy the ex 'flavor' gave me just a couple weeks ago is still sitting on my desk...

      Well I've gone and done it...decided to open myself up and actually show the world, despite the outward appearance of a lifestyle of glitz, glamour, and beauty...don't forget beauty, how boring my life is... ACTUALLY...I just wanted to keep up with the Jones' (and their life is probably more interesting then mine, well at least their kids are cute..so you may just want to stop reading and check their blog out instead... www.fourjones.com).  I guess some of you who are reading this don't even know what a Blog is, basically its a web log (hence the name) or journal...somewhere I can write about things going on with me or ramble on about...well anything I want to...so there.  Hopefully if I'm successful at all you can keep tabs on me while I'm flying all around the world...climbing the corporate ladder...errr...more like being the guinea pig and going where no man (or woman) wants to go.  Hopefully this won't be the only way you'll find out what I'm up too, but its a start.

      Home at last.  It was nice to finally come home...sleep in my own bed, go through piles of mail, wash my clothes...good times.  I didn't stay long though.  Less then 24 hours and I was out the door to pick up my sister at the airport and head to my parents.  I will be here for 3 days before going back to Chicago. Believe it or not as I sat watching Friends tonight with my family, much to my surprise I saw a familiar face standing behind Ross during the wedding scene.  A wanna be actor from good old Milligan College, hardly recognizable, and had I not been sitting with my sister (who also went to Milligan) to back my crazy thoughts up I may have not believed my own eyes.  After a call to Alina (who thank goodness taped the episode), who also backed me up, it was confirmed...5 years and all he gets is a 3 second shot of his face in the shadows...wow.

       urlLink The Strip   has been like no place I have ever been. I have walked up and down Las Vegas Blvd.  Checked out as much as I could.  New York New York and The Venetian (where the conference is being held) are my favorite casinos inside and out by far followed by Paris.  The fountains at the Bellagio I could watch all night and never get tired of them.  Cesars Palace will always be a classic.  People of all different shapes and forms come here for all different reasons.  I have lost 20 dollars in the slots, learned more about RFID technology then I probably will ever care to know, but I can now add another experience to the ever growing list.  Seattle, Kamloops (British Columbia) , Seattle, Portland, Seattle, Kamloops, Seattle, and Las Vegas all in 4 weeks...

      Today was a pretty good day.  The conference was for the most part interesting and the day went by pretty fast.  I ran into a couple of our clients which was a pleasant surprise.  I also picked up a creepy weird guy that followed me around this afternoon and kinda freaked me out. I went down and saw the dancing fountains tonight at the Bellagio which was very cool.  Back to business tomorrow.  A day and a half before I get to go home...honestly the 4 weeks have gone by pretty fast but I will be happy to be home.

      What a day!  I started out at about 11 this morning, hit the hot spots, registered for the conference and lost 20 dollars all in about 7 hours. The Casinos are amazing.  Disneyworld for adults.   My favorties have been The Venetian (where the conference is being held) , the ceilings here my favorite in here because as you walk the coulds appear to be moving even though they aren't.  New York, New York was my favorite inside and out.  It is amazing how it all looks real, from the Brooklynn Bridge, to the Statue of Liberty, to the streets inside, it really is amazing.   I have lost 20 dollars in the slots...I think I'm done for the week...it is too frustrating for me to keep putting in money that I could be shopping with.

      I have arrived!  Yesterday I woke up at 4:30 am to depart British Columbia and begin my journey to Vegas.  After landing 20 minutes early due to a medical emergency in Seattle, and a quick 2 hour flight to Las Vegas, I have reached my final destination before heading home.  Overwhelming is the only word that I can use to describe my first impression of Las Vegas.  Slot machines everywhere when you step of the plane...bells dinging, people everywhere, brides wandering...I am staying at the Mirage, which seems to be in the perfect location to see everything.  I grabbed something to eat and took a quick nap before heading out.  There seems to be so much to see but I really didn't know where to start.  I headed first to the Bellagio so I could see the dancing water. While waiting for the show to start I was already picking up the men.   A guy asked me if I knew when the show was going to start, what a pick up line, eh?  He asked me if I was here with friends, and I began wondering what my mother would think if she knew I was talking to strangers in Vegas?!?!  He has 2 friend with them but they all seemed harmless enough, after talking for about 20 minutes we all figured that the show must be cancelled due to strong winds, I decided I would go opposite direction of what ever they were going, and it worked out pretty nice.  I will admit it was fun being picked up though :)  I got back to the Mirage just in time to see the 'volcano' outside erupt...only in Vegas.    urlLink See picture of my flight into Vegas here    and  urlLink my first night in Vegas here.

      It is my last day in Kamloops.  I am ready to go home, yet it does not feel like I have been here 3 weeks.  I decided to spend my last day driving up to Sun Peaks, a popular ski resort, and the main reason a lot of people come to Kamloops in the first place.  The drive there was awesome.  Lots of mountains, lots of snow, lots of trees.  I wish I would have known how to ski.  The village around Sun Peaks is full of cottages and resorts which awesome.  See the pictures here.

I don't know if I will make it or not.  Every time the box pops up saying I have new mail I can hardly stand the anticipation of who may have sent me an e-mail....only to find out it is a Failed delivery Report from the last e-mail that I have sent.  It is a cruel world.  My favorite cd of the moment continues to skip, why I don't know, it worked perfectly fine yesterday.  2 hours, 23 minutes, and 20 seconds...

      Today at 5:30 pm a two EL trains collided on the commute home.  Had I been in Chicago there is a very good chance I would have been on one of those trains. 1500 passengers were on the 2 trains, in a total of 12 cars.  Luckily only about 45 minor injuries, so short of a major inconvenience it wasn't as bad as it could have been.   I will have to wait until tomorrow to see if anyone I knew was on either of the trains.   You can read the story at http://abclocal.go.com/wls/news/020304_ns_brownline_crash.html, I'd put the link in but I'm tired and don't feel like it.  Today I am grateful that I am in Canada.

      And back to Canada, eh...I got back from a great weekend in Portland tonight. I met the babies, which aren't so much babies any more.  They are sweet sweet kids and it was fun playing with them this weekend.  Nat thinks she's a princess and since she isn't old enough to know better I will let her continue to believe it ;)  Jack is a very happy little boy, from what I saw of him...he loves Tess so much that when she is the room nothing else in his world matters, and you'd think 'Meow' was the only word in is vocabulary (which is only a trick because he can say a lot of different words, even knows some Spanish).  I wish I had pictures of them but my camera was in the car..hence the reason for the lack of pictures.  Lina took me to some great little places to shop and I was able to get a taste of Portland.  It was a lot of what I thought it would be like, including the rain.  We got lucky today and actually had sunshine, which was really special because I got to see some of the area Mountains.   Flying back in the daylight today was amazing.  The sky's were pretty clear so I got a really good look of the different mt. ranges...Unbelievable...not even real.   So 6 more nights in Canada, I am ready to go home but I a m pretty sure that this week will go by pretty fast because I have a lot to do.  I'm signing off... urlLink here are a couple pictures from the weekend.

      Today I had a doctors appointment to get some allergy medicine because I have been having some headaches and thought maybe it was because of my sinus.  A shot in the butt, 2 pills a day of antibiotics, 1 pill for decongestiant,  2 tsp of some syrup which I haven't quit figured out,  and a nasal spray later I return from the doctors office...turns out I have a sinus infection and a bad case of post nasal...I didn't even really feel sick, I was more going as a "precaution" for future headaches.  How in the world? As I sit with my pills in front me  trying to figure out what I take next I am baffled how this all happened after a 2 hour visit.  How looking up my nose, in my ear, and listening to me breath for a 3 seconds has left me with a big old bag of medication, I am not sure I can comprehend.  I also have to put some topical cream on a funky spot on my hand and may have to have a biopsy.  Figure that out?  I have done it, I have defeated the Price Fairy.  I told you I bought my tickets on Saturday for my trip to Cincinnati this weekend, well I checked today, the day I was going to wait until to buy my tickets b/c of the weekly special I see all the time...450 dollars!  I went on a gut instinct and bought them on Saturday, I don't know why, I had every intention of waiting until today.  It is a good day..well besides the shot in the butt...that wasn't that great.

      I am ashamed to say it but I had a makeout dream last night.  Not that there is anything wrong with makeout dreams.  Problem is that I was using my feminine charm to get a T-shirt.  I will admit I feel a little cheap.  Second problem...it was the worst kind of makeout dream.  One with someone I know.  I hate to drop names about me having makeout dreams on the internet of all places, you never know who reads these things after all.  I will say he went to Milligan and was in my Christ and Culture group...and out of the group, probably the one I would most likely make out with in real life.  I'm just glad I don't have to see him, for some reason it makes for an awkward moment even if it is only in my head.

      My dad, who turned 50 in February, finished the Shamrock Shuffle 8k today in 44 minutes.  Placing 3702 out of the men and 4590 out of 20,000ish overall.    If you ask me that is pretty darn good.  It was his first race ever and to do an 8K to start with was impressive.  So congratulations Dad, on a job very well done.

      Last night we headed to the South Sides UIV Paivilon to catch the Adoration Worship Tour which consisted of The Newsboys, Rebecca St. James, Don Moen, Jeremy Camp, and Sarah Groves.  However,  before we went to the concert we stopped to get some dinner.  Due to lack of time, we decided to grab something quick, we spotted a Subway not to far from the concert.  Once we got closer we noticed that there was a Chinese restraint next door so we decided we would do Chinese instead.  So we headed inside the 'See Thru Chinese restaurant,' you heard me correctly.  Where they got the name we could not comprehend. The menu was one like we had never seen...Including BBQ ribs and crab toast...we didn't understand much about the Chinese restaurant but we don't know anywhere else in Chicago where you can get 6lbs of sesame Chicken for 7 dollars.  So if you ever are in the hood, and want some Chinese...just look for the flashing neon of the See Thru.  The concert was great.  Everyone did less original songs and more worship songs which was awesome.  The Newsboys were very real and even though they have done this concert for months, they put their heart into it like it was their first performance.  I think that best song for me last night was Blessed Be Your Name...'You give and take away, you give and take away, my heart will choose to say Blessed be your name.'  The words hit home and the Spirit was moving.  I will admit, I was hoping they would do a little 'Shine' for old times sake and they didn't.  Still, good stuff.

      FYI...I did order my plane tickets to Cincinnati, finally!  After all I am leaving a week from today.  I probably would have held out until Monday or Tuesday but I didn't receive a price update this morning and it seems like I always get one on Saturdays so I got a little nervous.  I am fighting with American because their prices are ridiculous and they are who I have my frequent flier miles with.  260 on American, and I was able to get them for 126 through United although the times of both flights suck...(7:40 am on Saturday and 6:40 flying out on Tuesday).  Someone at American isn't doing their job...Their competitor kicked @$$.

      For some reason I had this awesome idea to put my 2 male bettas in the same bowl.  For those who know nothing about Bettas you are wondering why this is such a big deal.   Male bettas are very aggressive towards one another and will fight.  Well they did indeed fight and killed each other.  I was very sad, miraculously they both came back to life...Whew. Then it was on to the ski slopes.  I watched for a while and decided that I wanted to go sledding down this big hill. Climbed my butt up to the top where it looked more like a water slide then a sled hill.  A guy waved me on towards him which required me getting in this pool up to my chest.  Problem was I was fully clothed and my winter coat acted as a life vest.  I was required to take a swimming test before going down the hill...I believe the purpose was just in case you happened to go to far and ended up in the Lake at the bottom of the hill.  I almost failed the 'swimming' test for not catching a football the guy threw at me...luckily I talked him into letting me go.  After all that it wasn't even that fun, half the hill didn't even have snow...beep...beep...beep...beep...beep...

      Heck I don't even know if I watched the game.  But I could  urlLink Super Bowl Shuffle   with the best of them.  For those not from Chicago, you may not even know what it is...let me enlighten you.  Its a little diddy the Chicago Bears put together on their way to the Super Bowl.  Its full of 'white mans overbite', lack of rhythm, and really bad fake instrument playing with an 80's flare.  Its awesome.  Here's a brief example:  I'm Samurai Mike. I stop 'em cold. Part of the defense, big and bold. I've been jammin' for quite a while, Doin' what's right and settin' the style. Give me a chance , I'll rock you good, Nobody messin' in my neighborhood. I didn't come here lookin' for trouble, I just came to do the Superbowl Shuffle.  We're the Bears Shufflin' Crew. Shufflin' on down, doin' it for you. We're so bad we know we're good. Blowin' your mind like we knew we would. You know we're just struttin' for fun Struttin' our stuff for everyone. We're not here to start no trouble. We're just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle.  I'm mama's boy Otis, one of a kind. The ladies all love me For my body and my mind. I'm slick on the floor as I can be. But ain't no sucker gonna get past me. Some guys are jealous Of my style and class. That's why some end up on their (bleep). I didn't come here lookin' for trouble, I just get down to the Superbowl Shuffle.  The words don't do the Video justice...and if you want to see it I own a copy that I stole from my dad.    Why do I bring this up you ask?  Its not even football season.  One reason.  The legendary, Mike Singletary (Samurai Mike), spoke at my church on Sunday.  I was impressed by his humbleness and his realness.  He spoke about how, as Christians, we should face hard times and contrasted that against unbelievers.  He is legendary, yet he is relateable.  He listens for God to speak and is obedient even when its against his will.  A great speaker and seems like a great man.  We had a untiy service for this event so I would say 2000-3000 + in one service with an awesome time of worship by  urlLink PW Gopal   (great worship leader...kinda Third Day...U2ish sound), made for a great Sunday.  If only I had brought my VHS for an autograph...

      Nick Lachey left Jessica for me. Don't worry, she cheated on him.  Its not like he just up and left her.  I didn't mean for it to happen in fact I didn't know I even found him attractive.  Karen drove past us while we were in his pickup truck driving out of the subdivision I grew up in.  She couldn't believe what she was seeing.  I waved. We headed to Burger King for breakfast but I can't remember what we ordered..but I'm pretty sure I had coffee...beep...beep...beep...beep...beep...beep...beep...

      If 3 times a bridesmaid never a bride...what about 5 times?  In May I will be 5 times a Bridesmaid.  I've been to so many weddings the past 2 years people often ask me if I have any single friends.  The funny thing is that I don't know if it is actually sunk in that most of my best friends in the world have moved on to the married phase of their life.  I participate in these weddings, stand next to these girls I'm so close to, read scripture (quiet well might I add) for couples that have grown dear to me, buy shower presents, give toasts...and none of it seems real.  I go through the motions..play dress up, smile at the right time, cry (to put it lightly if you would have seen me at my best friend Mandy's wedding) and yet it seems as if I'm in just saying my lines in a big production.   I can not process the thought that all of this is happening.  I still find myself sitting on the 'L' on the way to work thinking..I CAN NOT BELIEVE SO AND SO IS MARRIED.  Married!  I am not jealous of these people...I don't even think I'm ready to get married.  I still feel like I'm in the awkward teenage years.  I want to run around and yell at everyone...what are you doing?!?!  Do you  realize that this is not pretend. We SURELY can't be old enough to be getting married...and yet I see the scales tipping.  Its like being naked in a dream and realizing everyone else is wearing clothes...WHY IS EVERYONE ELSE WEARING CLOTHES?!?! It is times like this I am very thankful to be living in a place where being single is the 'norm' and even the more socially accepted.  I am comfortable here.  I know that my girlfriends won't be getting married tomorrow and that I could meet a single guy on the way to work. And perhaps that is the reason for the nakedlike feeling when I go to these weddings...  Gotta myself a little threadbare gypse soul Likes to dance and drink and go where ever the wind blows Gotta a little a little threadbare gypse soul  Gotta a little a little threadbare gypse soul   Gotta little wild streak in my heart I guess I have had it since I've heard the music start Gotta little wild streak in my heart Gotta a little threadbare gypse soul   I like to hear the highway sounds I don't think that I'll ever settle down I can't change and its a sin, hope Saint Peters gonna let me in Come on Pete won't you let me in  I wear this Cowboy hat upon my head You can take it off me sometime after I am dead Got a cowboy hat upon my head Gotta a little Threadbare Gypse Soul  I wear these crusty shoes down my feet, I could write a book about the places that they've seen I've got these crusty shoes down my feet Gotta a little wild streak in my heart  I like to hear the highway sounds I don't think that I'll ever settle down I can't change and its a sin, hope Saint Peters gonna let me in Come on Pete won't you let me in  I know this crazy living just ain't right Most of the time I'm smokin, drinkin, looking for a fight But I've been talkin to Jesus everyday I've been talkin to Jesus everday  - Threadbare Gypse Soul, Pat Green & Willie Nelson  For those that are interested...I took a big step today.  I deleted Colins name off my Instant Message List.  It only took me a month to realize that he actually doesn't want to talk to me any more.  Everyday I would open up my list and see his name staring back at me.  I knew it was only a matter of time before he cracked...or not.  I have come to grips with the fact that he indeed does not want to talk to me ever again and that its okay.  I do not have to be friends with all of my ex boy friends...in fact its not really normal.  So the deed is done.  I no longer will subject myself to his name glowing bright green...Good bye Colin.

      For a girl that supposedly looks good in green...I think I need to invest.  I opened my closet today and couldn't find one thing to wear to work this morning that was green.  Oddly enough I found plenty of pink which in a red heads world is socially unacceptable.  Its the rebel in me :)  I was rethinking the number of states/countries I have been in the past 6 months.  I think the number is larger then I originally thought: Chicago, Illinois Northwest Indiana Cincinnati, Ohio Wichita, Kansas  Tulsa, Oklahoma  Fayetteville, Arkansas Miami, Florida Hati Jamaica Grand Caymen, Mexico Cozomel, Mexico Seattle, Washington  Kamloops, BC Canada  Portland, Oregon Las Vegas, Nevada  So the tally is at 10 states (including IL)  and 4 countries (Including the US).  I've been a busy girl. I counted 19 different planes...34 hours in flight, 20 hours sitting in the airport, 19  bags of pretzels, and 1 stained shirt from the Merlot that a woman spilt on me on a really bad flight.  If I liked flying this would be heaven...not so much though.  I mean I don't hate it but its not something I look forward too.   Rumors are flying that I may be going to California for one full month and then 3 half months.  I'm not sure how I feel about it but I kinda have my fingers crossed that I don't get this one.  I guess we'll see.

      Its always strange to me when the past comes and knocks on the door.  The past couple of weeks I have heard from a lot of people from my past and I'm not sure why that is.  I'm guessing a sign from God to help me get out of the 'funk' that I have been in lately.  I actually haven't even thought about being in a 'funk' for about a week so maybe it worked.  It started almost 2 weeks ago when I decided to call Kimbo...then I talked to Christy Paul online, a brief (unfortunate) e-mail from Piesly, followed by another IM conversation with Emily,which made me think that I needed to call Kelli, followed by another instant message from a friend of mine Teresa from high school...that was followed by a brief conversation with Nick Tule, which led me to read Julie Revees Blog, which in turn made me send her a quick e-mail to catch up, then a phone call from Houston on Thursday,  a phone call from Jen on Sunday, and a random short e-mail from Neven Hooker on Monday.  All of these people whom I really hadn't had contact with in a while.  Man, just tell God you think you are friendless and they start coming out of the wood work.  For any of those mentioned that are reading this...thanks! The Price Fairy is playing with my emotions again today.  This morning I got a e-mail from Yahoo! Best Fare notifier that my plane ticket had dropped in price to 99 dollars from 209!  I was so pumped...went to the site, entered my info...only to find out that it is for the next 2 weekends and not the first weekend in April.  I am going to continue to hold off...but so help me if they jack the prices up for that weekend.    I saw 'The Passion' on Saturday.  Horribly amazing is about the only thing I can say.  I do have a question for anyone who is reading this (and maybe I'm kidding myself thinking you are actually reading)...why did Mel Gibson not include the line of the centurion.."Truly this was the Son of God".  I was waiting for that line...I needed to hear it.  I felt a little robbed.  I thought maybe it was because he based the movie on John (the only Gospel without the line).  But after going back and reading through the different Gospels it seems that he took bits and pieces from them and not just one.  Any ideas?

      So I've been having the feeling lately that I need to de-clutterize my life, probably some mental or emotional problem that I'm trying to ignore...so what...don't look at me like that...jerk... DROP IT... kidding...anyway,  I yanked everything out of my 2 closets and started going through boxes I hadn't opened since college.  There were a lot of memories in those boxes...both good and bad.  More good though, and lots of stuff that I wanted to look at more...old pictures, notes, cards, 'diaries'...my Christ and Culture note book, oh that was a good one, I could have sat around the rest of the night and read my groups comments on thoughts of the daily readings and class time...Andy Hull referring to Nascar...Dan Drage saying if an intruder was about to murder his wife and children and he had a gun in his hand he would not pull the trigger because he would be harming one of Gods creatures...cough cough bull @#$% cough cough...sorrry I digress...none of that's going to de-clutter my jammed packed closet now is it??  5 hours and 45 minutes later everything is put away and as I look at my closets it looks just as packed as before only everything seems to be in a different place then it was 5 hours earlier...I do have a huge donation pile though so maybe I did get rid of more stuff then I thought...   There was one thing I did run across that I couldn't bring myself to put it back in the box or in the Goodwill pile...The Rules...I'm sure you have heard of them...they are the 'Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Hearts of Mr. Right'.  I'm not even really sure where I got the book in the first place.  I think my sister and she is now married so maybe they really do work ;)  Doubt it though.  It is 11:53, I'm in bed and I can't help but remember how a close friend at good ole' Milligan College and I would read one rule a night before bed...so Julie, this one is for you..and if I remember correctly, one of the classics...  RULE NUMBER 6 ... Don't Call Him and Rarely Return His Phone Calls - 'If you are following "The Rules"  religiously there is no reason to call him.  He should be calling you, and calling you again and again until he pins you down for a date.  To call men is to pursue them which is completely against "The Rules"...'   OMG, I could go on and on cause this chapter is HILARIOUS, but I won't because its 4 pages.  Just remember girls..."One last thought on phone calls:  some times we want to call a man we are dating not to speak to him but just to hear his voice.  We feel we are simply going to die if we don't hear his sexy voice this minute.  That's understandable.  We suggest you call his answering machine while he's at work.  Hang up before the beep.  It really works!"

      I just heard Kenny Roger sing 'Wind Beneath My Wings' and I'm some what disturbed...  Kenny, stick to 'The Gambler'.    I'm frustrated today!  I'm trying to buy plane tickets but what I don't understand is why one weekend they charge you 103 dollars for a one hour flight but you want tickets for the next weekend it is 230.  WHY?!?!  Do I get more pretzels?  More leg room?  A better view?  NO!   It's not even a holiday...well besides being the home opener of the Reds playing the destine to win Cubs.  So you wait to see if the price will drop, next thing you know its doubled...WHAT IS THE DEAL PEOPLE?  Why should the guy sitting next to me pay less then I'm paying when we are going to the same place, at the same time??  Where is this Airline Fare Wizard and what makes him jack the prices up?  If he's having a really bad day does everyone have to pay for it?  If his mom is traveling a certain weekend he lowers the price down?    The worst feeling is knowing that after you book and are locked in the price will drop 50 bucks.  It is a cruel world we live in and if anyone finds the Airline Fare Wizard, tell him I'm looking for him and if he doesn't want to be hurtin to drop the ticket price to Cincinnati for the first weekend in April.  Punk!

      I'm in a funk...I can't tell what stage of 'funk' ..coming or going...but I'm pretty sure I have almost hit the bottom.  The past 6 months have gone by so fast I have been in 9 states and 2 countries and although it sounds glamorous most of it was for work and I believe is to blame for my current state of funkiness, that and the end of what I thought was going to be a perfectly good relationship...which would have never happened if I wouldn't have started traveling in the first place.  So now I'm disorganized, friendless, and broken hearted...now why would I be in a funk?   I know how to remove myself from the funk but the odd thing about being in a funk is that you really have no motivation to, which is a problem.  So I will wait it out, I am sure I will wake up one day and forget that I was even in a funk the day before...   I like the words of 'Why Georgia'...I think that John Mayer was in a funk when he wrote those lyrics...driving 85 and passing up your exit to your apartment, stuck in side the gloom sounds like the actions of one in this state...if I owned a vehicle I would be half way to Tennessee by now.  I love that he calls it a 'quarter life crisis,'  and find it interesting that I just picked up on these lyrics a month and 34 days before my 25 birthday...perhaps another cause of the Funk?

      I am driving 85 in the kinda morning that last all afternoon Just stuck inside the gloom 4 more exits till my apartment but  I am tempted to keep the car in drive  and leave it all behind  Cause I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdictless life.  I rent a room and fill the spaces with  Wood in places to make it feel like home But all i feel is alone It might be a quarter life crisis Or just the stiring of my soul  So what, so I've got a smile on But its hiding the quiet superstitons in my head Don't believe me when I say I've got it down.  Everybodys just a stranger but Thats the danger in going my own I guess its the price I've got to pay Still everything happens for a reason Is no reason not to ask myself.  If I am living it right? Am I living it right? Am I living it right? Why Georgia why?   - Why Georgia, John Mayer

      My morning walk to the train always includes a call to/from my mother, it has become a part of our every day routine.  I am not sure when or how it started, but it has probably been going on for 6 months.  She is on her way to the gym, I am on the way to the train so it's how we pass our commute.  Today, she didn't call.  I couldn't find her, no response.  Okay, I figured she forgot her phone.  I waited an hour...no mom...I waited 30 minutes and still no mom...couldn't reach her on her home or cell phone...strange...now I'm starting to worry because on a normal day she has usaually called me 3+ times by now.  No one has heard from her...my dad, my sister, my grandma...so we sit and wait, all of us getting a bit anxious.  Finally, after 2 hours and 36 minutes of waiting she is found.  She forgot to take her cell phone with her.  It is now apparent that we all freaked out for nothing but also how reliant we have all be come on cell phones.  10 months ago she didn't even have a phone.  Did we not care about her then?  Of course we did we just wouldn't have noticed she was gone yet. We use these things like they are attached to our head, and are lost without.  I seriously wouldn't even know my sister phone number without it...nor many of my friends numbers.  At baseball games we use it to wave at our friends at home when we are on camera, at concerts we use them to find friends in a sea of people, some of us call upstairs when we are downstairs.  How would we find my father in the mall without it?   Amazing technology but today made me realize that we get a little carried away sometimes.

      There is something about the people you meet at Milligan College that is unlike people you meet in any other place.  "The Piesly's"...as I like to call them now thanks to Alina...called me on Sunday.  I haven't talked to them in probably 6 months and yet we talked like we were sitting around the lunch table.  Kelli also called me Sunday...I probably talked to her every couple of months but I still feel like I can vent my frustrations of the opposite sex to her (or any of the other Milligan girls) like it was a late night in Hart 204.  Its playing Mario Kart with Stephen Jones like we were in Web 311.  Or staying up late with CP talking about Harry Jam.  The list goes on.  They are the type of friends that you can pick up the phone and pick up from where you left off.  No matter how long it has been since you've talked, no matter how much distance is between you...its a genuine friendship like none other I have ever experienced.  Some of those friendships are based on only a semester or two of time at MC yet that doesn't seem to matter.  If there is one thing that I got out of Milligan (and there are actually many many things I took away from that magical...okay maybe magical is not the correct phrase) is friendships with people that I really do believe could last a beyond a life time.  Sorry for the cheesy post, I know I'm one chorus away from busting out the Michael W. Smith classic "Friends"  but I never want to forget to thank God for the great people that have invested their lives in me and who provide me with more joy then they will ever know.

      For some reason I have the worst time ever when it comes to buying electronics.  You would think for an 'IT Specialist' I would not have a problem in this department but I do.  There are to many choices...to many sizes, to many price ranges...more memory, less memory...wide screen, flat screen...24 inch, 27 inch, 36 inch...I had more stress over buying my laptop then I did over starting my first job or moving to Chicago.  I am in the process of buying a new TV and a MP3 player.  I have space limitations in my place when it comes to the TV.  I looked around Best Buy for an hour tonight and left empty handed.  I have been talking about buying an IPOD for a month now and haven't taken the plung.  Some might think it's because of the high price tag on these items that gets me freaked out...but really I don't think its that.  I knew with my bonus check a month ago these are the 2 purchases I would spend it on.  I think maybe it is more of the concern that as soon as I do make the purchase something bigger and better will come out and I will have buyers remorse.  Who knows.  Anyway I am putting a deadline on myself...by June 1st I will have a new TV and a new IPOD.  No excuses...No regrets...it's time to suck it up and make a decision.

      Well, I did it.  I got the promotion I have been moaning and groaning about for the past couple of months.  It has been a area of high stress and worry for me.  It doesn't necessarily change my views on my company nor will it change my future actions.  However I have to say it feels really SWEET.  I am very happy that I am finally being recognized for the work that I do (not to mention be paid for the work that I do).  Stephen Jones...how about another salary bet?

      Yesterday a strange thing happened while I was taking a walk at lunch.  I start to hear a loud ruckus and I figure it is from people protesting in front of one of the government buildings.  After a while it becomes more apparent that the ruckus is loud music...the Hokey Pokey actually.  I'm searching around wondering where it is coming from and I spot a trolley...as it gets closer I see a man dressed as a banana...as it gets even closer I see multiple bananas...and when it is about to pass me I see possibly 25 human banana's.  Who could not laugh at this sight?  I think it may have been one of the most random hilarious things I have ever seen.  I see they are all holding Jamba Juice cups...obviously promoting the new store.  2 peels up for this one.  They made my day.

      It is 11:19...I have missed my bed time by 19 minutes and counting.  I hate going to bed.  I really do.  I'm not sure why...maybe because I know that it means tomorrow is almost here and I just have to get up and go to work...maybe its because I just am not ready to go to bed...but I am an '8 hour girl' and really have no choice...maybe I'm rebelling against the 7:00 bedtime my mom gave me when I was little...maybe because it is the first time in the day where everything is quiet except for the thoughts going through my head.  Maybe I should consider being quiet more..

      Its is 8:22 on a Tuesday...we have been having tornado watches all evening and it was just updated to a warning...the weather man says be prepared to take cover...we have had the annoying 'emergency broadcast system' beep break through 'The Real World' twice.  Where exactly do they expect a girl who lives on the third floor of an apartment complex to 'take cover'?  There's always the stairwell...but then again the doors/walls are glass windows...there is the moldy laundry room...but then there are windows in there too...so I guess I stay seated on my couch...listening to the rain hit the roof (one of my favorite sounds) waiting to hear the freight train.  Today on the train I one of my favorite things happened...as the train heads north out of downtown I got to see the city disappear in the clouds.  The overcast sky's engulf the buildings until you can hardly see them any more.  It's always an amazing site to me...watching it from the L...you are right at the point where you are below the cloud but high enough to see what they are doing to the city.

      Steve Jones and I seem to be sitting in a car...Completely trashed.  Considering neither of us are big drinkers this is already a strange one.  He decides that he is to smashed to drive so he staggers out of the car, heads to the passenger side, passes out.  I then drag him into the car.  Knowing that I am the less drunk of the two of us I decide to drive.  I drive around the parking lot for a while and then realize that Kobe and Lincoln are in the back seat in their car seats. At this point I know I should not be driving, especially with the boys in the back seat but I continue to do it anyway.  Steve and I get out a convenience store.  I ask a woman where something is and she tells me but comments on the alcohol she can smell on my breath.  I see 2 cops at the counter and am afraid she will tell them that I have been drinking.  Luckily she doesn't and I buy some gum to cover it up in case they do ask.  I can't remember much more of the dream besides Steve buying some water to try to 'sober up'.    I have already apologized to Wendy for drinking and driving with her babies in the car.  It was one of those dreams that you wake up feeling bad.  She has accepted my apology.

      Perhaps one of the worst kind of dreams...one that involves a co-worker...one that makes you feel kinda awkward when you see them the next day.  My co-workers and I were going on a cruise (what?don't you take all your coworkers on vacation with you?) There were at least 3 that I know were really co-workers that I recognized.  We were on a tram that took us to the boat and I forgot my coat on the tram (I'm pretty sure this is coming from an actual experience of leaving my coat on the plane when I flew to Cinci).  Anyhow, we never actually got on the boat...but we did turn around and get back on the tram...I'm not really sure why.  Next thing I remember one particular co-worker and I were running through the airport.  Our hands brushed and I quickly recoiled...you know how you do when you touch someone's hand on accident and don't want them to think there is any funny business.  But it happened again..and this time I couldn't recoil because he wasn't letting go.  I didn't know what to do, so I didn't do anything but realized, that in this case, it was an inappropriate situation(which to avoid an even awkwarder situation, I will not name names).  He then proceeds to kiss me and tell me that we should ditch the rest of the crew...during this time, I can do nothing but search the area making sure no one saw that.  I then tell him how wrong this is and that due to his current situations this can NOT be happening (whats with another kissing dream anyway?)...however in this case we will never know what happened because my alarm rudley interrupted me yet again.

      The biggest bug I have ever seen just ran out from under my door.  One of those thousand leggers...but a REALLY big one.  He ran under my bed, where I am sitting.  NOW WHAT?!?!?!  I run to the closet...grabbed the bug spray and started spraying hopelessly under my bed.  Can that thing crawl up the blankets?!?! Now what?!?!  Did I get him...should I pretend that I did??  WAIT!  He is retreating!  Covered in a white film.  TARGET HIT TARGET HIT!  CONTINUE FIRE...MOTION DETECTED!  He is now covered in a rather thick white filmy substance.  Movement ceased.  Now I must pick him up and flush him...thats as bad as seeing him for the first time.  I know he's dead but he still creeps me out.  I get up the balls to do it.  Mission accomplished.  Except for that odor that now saturates the area around and underneath my bed.  Good thing its a nice night...I open the windows and now can hear drunks screaming down the streets...

      I just got home from dancing...my legs were sore, from my little jog yesterday, when I went...after I started dancing I forgot about it...after I sat down for 30 minutes in the car on the way home I could hardly move them...I have blisters on both of my big toes and I'm pretty sure I will not be able to get out of bed in the morning.   My friend Noel analyzed my relationships on our way home tonight.  Why people have decided to do this lately I am not sure...is it because I'm 25 now?  On my way to 'Old Maidem'?  I'm not sure but this has happened twice this month.  This time it was actually pretty insightful.  Noel and I are friends from swing dancing...we don't talk about deep relationship issues...we dance...and we aren't dancing...we are talking about dancing.  So why was tonight different?  Noel gave me a ride tonight..so we actually sat in the car for 20 minutes...and you can only talk about dancing for so long!  On our way home he said something about...weren't you like dating a guy in Tulsa?...why yes, I did, how did he know that?...apparently he had heard from a friend of a friend...and in all honesty he had guessed Tulsa.  His first question to me was...Why do you continue to sabotage your relationships?...WOH...What is he talking about?  He doesn't even know about any of my relationships.   He asked me what my phobia was with relationships?   BACK THE BUS UP...HOLD THE PHONE...why would he think I have relationship phobias? He replies that I was clearly sabotaging the relationship with the guy in Tulsa...why date a guy in Tulsa...because I knew deep down it wouldn't work.  He said it was safe...he was right.  He asked me how long my longest relationship was...I said 10 months...he laughs...a lot...hysterically.  He says I'm 25 and my longest relationship is 10 months?!?!  I thought that was long.  Now he is sure I have relationship phobias.  He asked me if my parents were still together and how their relationship was or is...they are and its great.  This stumps him for a while.  I tell him that maybe that's why...because I feel loved and so don't find it that great of a need to find love...he isn't sure.  He asked me if I was spoiled...I guess I was a bit spoiled.  He asked me how my relationship was with my dad...great, awesome, my dad's a great guy, we get a long, we hang out...he comes to his first of many conclusion: 1.  Know that no one is going to be just like your dad.  Everyone has their own faults.  Everyone is their own person.  Don't let this hurt a perfectly good relationship or hinder the possibilities of a relationship.  Fine, I will admit I have compared guys to my dad in the past.    2.  Stop sabotaging relationships!  Don't start ones that I know won't work out.  Stop wasting my time with people in other states...with people with different views on the important stuff.  Don't think are going to change or get better.  Don't put myself in or sabotage relationships from the get go.  Some how my 'standards' come up.  He thinks that a person like me is likely to have standards that are too high.    Not that high standards are bad he said...but that:  3.  I need to remember that no one is perfect.  That we all have our own faults (even if we don't like to admit them).    Okay...I'll go along with that.  Although I think I already knew this and I don't really think my standards are to high.  We continue to talk about past relationships.  At this point many of the puzzle pieces start to come together to him.  Why, in my 25 years, have I never asked anyone one(besides once in High School but we both agreed it didn't count)out?  Why do I let opportunities past me by to tell people how I really feel?  Why haven't I learned from the past that this hurts me?  Waiting, hoping that they will do it first so I don't have to?    4.  I am afraid of rejection.   I have a serious case of rejection phobia on top of the relationship phobia.  This could be due to the fact that I was spoiled growing up.  I am use to having what I want.  I am intimidated by men.  I fear that when I am straight forward and upfront that I will be rejected, so instead of setting myself up, I avoid it at all costs.    Noel tells me next time I'm interested, that I shouldn't be afraid to let them know.  What's the worst thing that can happen...and that I need to remember that if/when they do say 'no'...they aren't really saying no to me...they are just saying that I am not their 'preference'.  All this in a car trip home.  He majored in psychology or took psychology class or something too...and I could tell, he was very insightful on the limited knowledge of my past relationships...and he didn't even charge me!  He also said that I probably won't ask anyone one out in the near future...he's probably right...but being aware of the issues in the first place is half the battle.  Its a lot to digest.  I think he really did make some great observations for knowing nothing about my past relationships.  If nothing else he gave me some 'food for thought'.

      Have you ever had one of those days where you stop and ask yourself...what have I done all day?  (Whoohoo...Cubs just tied the ball game...homerun by Sosa...bottom of the 9th...no outs...WAIT...ANOTHER ONE..MOSES ALOU...THANK YOU REDS BULLPEN!...CUBS WIN!)  That is the question I am asking myself.  I do not know where the day went, but I'm not complaining because I am home and 'I don't have to be me till Monday'.   I am going out dancing tonight.  I haven't been out in a while so I'm pretty excited.  I also am going to get to wear some of my summery clothes which is always fun after not wearing them for 6 months.   I met a new friend at lunch today.  He was really sweet, a financial planner, and in a suit.  I'm a sucker for a guy in a suit.  I met him while out with friends so I'm sure we will run into each other again. I think a nap is a necessity this evening before a night of dancing...ttfn.

      The weather was great today.  I couldn't wait to get out of the office!  I took a run this evening.  It was so good to be outside in this great city...the fresh air...the activity...pick up ball games...softball leagues...kids playing in the park...joggers...walkers...I'm praying we have shook the cold weather but this is the Chicago, where there are 2 things we never can fully put our trust in...the weather and the Cubs.  I hate running but today actually wasn't all that bad.  Tomorrow is suppose to be just as nice.  I will not complain.

      Why is it that every time I am watching Survivor and they do the 'letters from home bit' I end up in tears???  EVERY time!  They do it every season and I can not watch that episode without bawling.  These people did this to themselves...why am I crying...

      As you can see I've decided to change my blog name for the time being.  'Randomness' was used for the lack of better idea at the time but now that I have hit my 25th year I think that 'Quarter Life Crisis' is more appropriate for this stage in my life.    I'm working from my parents house today.  I had a doctors appointment this morning so it was just easier to stay here and go then try to get back to work.  It has been a pretty peaceful day.  Its nice out today so I have been working outside this afternoon.  I think this could be come addicting.   The Cubs served up a beating today instead of taking one.  Its going to be a long season.

      I continue to have dreams that involve me ex-boyfriend.  We don't seem to be getting back together in the dreams but he continues to show up.  2 nights ago I saw him from a distance and I found out that he had been talking to my parents and they weren't telling me.  Last night he was sitting in the bleachers about 20 rows behind me and although I knew he was there we didn't talk.  He is obviously in my dream for one reason or another.  I don't feel like I think about him a lot any more but I think deep down I have a  lot of guilt over the situation.  I am sad how things ended between us.  Sad that he never wants to talk to me again.  Sad that he may have a mental disorder and not know it.  Worried that he still may not be dealing well with everything.  I could be kidding myself though and he's fine...moved on and I'm the one still lingering over the past.  Even though I don't want to get back together with him I think I am being hard on myself and no matter how much I try to reassure myself that there is nothing I can do about it I can't help but have these feelings of guilt.   So although I try not to think about it, sometimes as I lay in bed at night my mind can't help but think about it... pray that he will be okay.  So maybe I just answered my own question as to why he makes a reoccuring cameo.  I know that I can't beat myself up over a hopeless situation but its hard not to for some reason...

      I was in the gym today starting to think what I was doing with my life.  How long I wanted to live in my apartment...if I would ever buy a car...and I decided that I kind of feel like my life is on hold because I feel like I need to make decisions about these things but haven't.  I feel the need to own property...but where, when, how much?  I don't want to move but I do I really want to continue to give 22% of my income for a roof over my head that is not even going to be mine after it is all said and done?  The I stopped myself and wondered why I was worry about this all the sudden.  Was it because I just turned 25 and feel like I need to grow up?  Why can't I continue living like I am?  Is there a problem with it?  According to David Bach who wrote the book that I'm currently reading, 'Automatic Millionaire' (which I highly recommend), there is no way I will ever become a millionaire if I continue renting...is he right?  Do I care if he is?  Stephen asked me this weekend if after my recent relationship 'mishaps' if it changes how I feel about what I want.  I don't know.   I do think I have a better attitude and am happier when I am with someone, and if you know me at all you also know that the previous statement is probably one of the hardest things in the world for me to say.   I'm not sure why I am rambling on about my deepest fears and concerns but I guess turning 25 has really made me start thinking that maybe it is time for me to take a hard look at what and why I do the things I'm doing.  Maybe I need to change things...maybe i don't...and maybe...just maybe that on this...my 25th year on this planet...I will witness the Cubs win the World Series.  We will just have to wait and see what a differance a year can make.

      I flew back to Chi-town this morning.  My only regret is booking at 6:40 am flight.  That is 5:40 cst which means I've been up since about 3:30 and came straight to work.  GREAT IDEA...or not.  I'm struggling.  My eyes are going a little cross right now.  Another bad idea is scheduling an afternoon meeting with your boss to discuss your promotion possibilities after major lack of sleep.  Wow, for that fact alone I don't deserve one. Cincinnati was a lot of fun.  I was really looking forward to the trip to get away from things here and just relax which I feel was accomplished.  The boys are getting big.  Kobe chose to ignore that I exist and I'm okay with that.  He's 2.  Lincoln, on the other hand, doesn't mind me and in my mind might even like me, we'll see how long that lasts.   My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.  The big 2-5 has arrived.  I don't know how I feel about it yet.  I am actually in pretty good spirits for how tired I am so I guess that is a good sign. Okay, I can't think any more...meeting w/ my boss is 24 minutes.

      I continue to comment on how fast my life has flown by the past 6 months, so much so that I feel like I've come around full circle.  It seems appropriate to start the Cubs season off in Cincinnati, after all it is where I went to my last game of the 2003 season.  I can remember the excitement and the anticipation of knowing the Cubs actually had a shot, of course the disappointment as I watched it crumble away shortly after that game, and then the thought having to wait 6 months until the next season started.  And here I am, back in Cincinnati...the same excitement and anticipation that I did then, of course in the back of my mind, the disappointment of knowing what it means to be a true Cubs fan, and also the realization that again, its going to be a long 6 months.  So tomorrow it starts, what will this season hold, no one knows.  Will this be the season the curse is lifted?  And if it is does that change the definition of what a Cubs fan is? Do we even know how to act as winners?  I don't know about you, but I can't wait to find out.

      Today at work I get a random message from a co-worker asking me if I was back with Colin.  Puzzled, I could not for the life of me figure out why in the world she would be asking me this.  I quickly reply that if I am it is news to me, Colin and I haven't exactly been on 'speaking' terms the past 2 months.  Mind still reeling, I ask why in the world she would ask me that.  As a team we are asked to record our vacation on a team calendar...Apparently there are 2 lonely names on Monday, April 5th.  Mine is one of them...one guess who the second is.  If I didn't know the status of the relationship I would probably be asking the same question.  Either way, I know that I will have the better day on Monday...after all, what beats the first Cubs game of the season...even if the high on Monday in Cincinnati is 50 as of right now...

      So I am in my office, and a long comes a 'friend' of mine that just happens to be single and attractive.  I am very impressed that he found my office and made time to stop by to chat for a while.  For some reason there are bags of tootsie rolls on my desk...not sure why.  Anyway, all of the sudden we are rudely interrupted by my cell phone.  In a circumstance such as this I would usually choose to ignore that the phone even exists.  However, since we in the office, and it is ringing rather loud I decide that I better answer it.  I am digging through my purse like a mad woman trying to find the dang thing...I finally get to it in time to find that my Dad has just hung up.  GRRR...then I figure, maybe this is not a bad thing, after all my 'friend' is still here.  So we resume conversati...the phone starts ringing again...although things are becoming a bit fuzzy now...my 'friend' is drifting away, no, don't go...but its to late...this time it is not my cell phone...in fact it is not in my dream at all.  It is my home phone.  I jump up and run in time to answer it and find out it's my mom...for real.  Asking me why I never answered my cell phone...

      Well, it's Memorial Day weekend...and I have one more day of freedom before returning to the grind.  So far the weekend has been a success.  I was able to go out with some new friends on Friday and had a really good night.  Most of the day Saturday I spent at home hanging out in the rain...and actually I hate to admit this...but a friend of mine gave me tapes of all the seasons of Dawsons Creek, and because I really only watched the last 2 seasons, I have become addicted to see what lead up to the Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle.  I think I'm somewhere at the end of season 2 but its really hard to tell considering they all run together (and are all so very much alike...Dawsons with Joey, they break up, they get back together, they break up...you see where this is going).  Any how, after watching a few episodes of good ole Dawson, I headed down to Indiana to see my parents...went to dinner...watched the Cubs game with my grandparents...a little time in my parents hot tub...all in all very relaxing.  Today we went to church, spent time at my other grandmas about an hour south of here, for the most part tried to avoid being outside what-so-ever because of the horrible storms we have been having.  My dad and I played NHL Hitz for about 4 hours tonight...until we both had blisters on our thumbs, it was awesome!  Tomorrow I decided to stay down here and spend one more day with my parents...free meals, a movie, what else can I ask for.  I hope everyone else is having a great Memorial day weekend...Friday seems like a distant memory...work, a thing of the past...if only ever weekend was 3 days.

      As I walked out of my office today I'm a bit giddy...a smile on my face...i feel a bit like skipping, but restrain myself because I don't want this feeling to be ruined by blank 'crazy' person stares.  It's the feeling of being in love yet I'm not...maybe its because the sun is shining...maybe its the joy of a Friday with an upcoming weekend before a 3 day weekend...maybe its the ipod that's on its way...I prefer to think its the overwhelming joy of the Lord.  I'm overcome with a happiness...a drunkenness persay, my cup runneth over.

      Big props to God tonight...wow what a show.  The sunset was amazing tonight.  I rollerbladed to the lake front to meet some friends for beach volleyball.  It was a tank top kinda night which I never complain about.  While playing with the cool sand squishing between my toes for the first time this year, looking straight ahead I see the city surrounded in purple clouds, to my right, the bike path filled with runners, bikers, bladers all with a smile on their faces...the sun setting in the most amazing colors, and to the left we got a cool breeze coming in off the lake...it was one of those sun sets that was good to the last drop.  The only thing missing was my camera...I wish so much that I had it with me...its not fair that I can't share the city wrapped in all those awesome colors...one picture and I could have probably paid for the ipod.  It was a good night to live in the city...a very good night.

      We call them cool  Those hearts that have no scars to show  The ones that never do let go  And risk the tables being turned   We call them fools  Who have to dance within the flame  Who chance the sorrow and the shame  That always comes with getting burned   But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire  'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire   We call them strong  Those who can face this world alone  Who seem to get by on their own  Those who will never take the fall   We call them weak  Who are unable to resist  The slightest chance love might exist  And for that forsake it all   They're so hell-bent on giving ,walking a wire  Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire   Standing outside the fire  Standing outside the fire  Life is not tried, it is merely survived  If you're standing outside the fire   There's this love that is burning  Deep in my soul  Constantly yearning to get out of control  Wanting to fly higher and higher  I can't abide  Standing outside the fire   Standing outside the fire  Standing outside the fire  Life is not tried, it is merely survived  If you're standing outside the fire   Standing outside the fire  Standing outside the fire  Life is not tried, it is merely survived  If you're standing outside the fire   -Garth Brooks

      I really have wanted to write lately but nothing interesting enough has happened in the last few days that would be half way interesting to write about.    I am getting ready to prepare for a study I have to lead tonight at 20somethings on Homosexuality.  To a group of Christians this wouldn't usually be a very controversal topic, however, I lead the 'new comers' group which is usually full of people from a variety of backgrounds of religion or lack there of.  Tonight will be a stretch of the comfort zone for me.  They gave me some great resources to pull from and hopefully they will come in handy tonight.  If anyone is interested:  www.probe.org/docs/homo-q&a.html or www.probe.org/docs/ex-gay.html or www.probe.org/menus/wp-marriage.html (scroll down half way to find 'homosexuality.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Tonight I may be actually be forced to go to bed at a decent hour.  My friend Jeanne who is a missionary in Bulgaria is in the states for a short time and was able to come up and visit for the evening.  We had a great time and I'm really glad she made it up to see me.  Then we got hit by some nasty storms and she got very tired waiting them out so she is asleep on the couch and I don't have a whole lot of options.  It is a good thing, because I have been wearing myself out lately.  Tonight is a great night to lay in bed and hear the thunder and the rain falling on the roof while drifting off to sleep.  Its one of those nights you look forward to the storms.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Another day, another single friend lost forever...Chrissy got married today to Chris Miller, now my 2 best friends from home are both married and both have the last name Miller.  Funny how that worked out huh?  The guys aren't related but both grew up in the same town...strange... The wedding was outside and it was FREEZING!  It may have been 55 but with the wind it felt like 48 and we were in the shade.  Our dresses were strapless and did not help the situation at all.  Luckily it was quick and we lost feeling after about 15-20 minutes.    It was a wonderful wedding, Chrissy looked beautiful as always and it made me yet again realize how single I was.  I can't wait to get back to the city where my realization fades as soon as I get any where near the vicinity of Lincoln park.  I feel very blessed to be fortunate enough to live where I live and it will only get better as it gets warmer.    I should have some pictures up tomorrow.

      This afternoon I attended my friends wedding rehearsal in Merriville, Indiana at a banquet hall on the outskirts just before you hit the corn fields of Indiana.  When we arrived there were several semi's and big tour buses in the parking lot.  I knew that Merriville High School was to have their prom there later on that night.  What I didn't know was that MTV was going to be there filming it all.  Apparently some girl from  MHS had won an MTV contest to have MTV follow her around to film her prom experience.  While it was apparent that something was going to be different at this prom...the excitement of the trucks, notices posted that if you enter the building you will be video taped, just a buzz around the building.  As we stood in the lobby of the hall trying to stay out of the rain before the rehearsal (which was outside), 4 or 5 large African Americans were headed toward the doors...something was different here and I couldn't decide what it was...while the older crowd clutched their purses a little tighter...I joked to watch out and make way for 50 cents...I noticed the first guy with security badages around his neck and everything else went so quickly as they were wisked away to a side room...okay I thought...I think I should know who that was...Michael Brady to the rescue...it was a memeber of The Black Eyed Peas...Mtv brought them along to perform at the Prom...I can only imagine what he was thinking as he walked through the lobby with a bunch of middle classed white people who were clearly looking at him like a) a hoodlum or b) ignoring his presence...he was probably laughing inside at the room of crackers who had no idea who he was.  Little did everyone know...

      So apparently another symptom of turning 25 is that no one thinks you will be able to find a mate on your own.  So they kindly take matters in their own hands..neighbors, friends, kids of friends, people they've met at the gym, a waiter on my parents cruise, 80's Dave (after all he did just get rid of his mullet)...I get all kinds of offers.  A friend of mine went so low to create me an online personal without me knowing it.  How sad is it that that is even possible?  She thought it inappropriate to converse with guys so she let me in on the secret.  I refuse to reply to any of the messages that I have been getting...try as she might, I am not meeting a guy over an online dating service...no thanks.  I understand that in 25 years, my attempts have been weak and unsuccessful...even a bit pathetic in a few cases.  I'm on my way to turning into one of those people that you have to think something is wrong with them to still be single...cause its not possible that they just couldn't have found the right one...GASP!

      I'm not being morbid...and I'm not talking about what would happen to your soul.  I think we all know where that's going.  I'm talking about what will would happen here on Earth...right here right now.  Who would come to the funeral?  I wonder who's tears would be real...like the sobbing kind.  Or if my ex-boyfriends would care.  I don't even start to imagine what my family would go through...That's not really what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about those people in your life...that you're not really sure where you stand...those people.   How much difference did you make in their lives?  What would they do w/ your desk at work if you were tragically taken...clear your stuff obviously but who would be the first to take it over?  Who would get your stuff?  I'm not on this Earth to please man and I can't say I think about this often but there are times when I wonder...

      National Day of prayer was yesterday and for the first time I fasted.  I debated posting about it because I don't want to make a big deal about it but I feel the need to write about some stuff that I think is coming from that.  It was not an easy thing for me.  I am blessed with headaches..horrible ones.  So I didn't think I could make it through the day w/o one.  But I did, he is gracious.  Yesterday was not easy at work...I had a hard time concentrating and I had a big deadline in less then 24 hours.  So busy at work that I did not get to take my lunch which I had planned as God time.  I know its hardly an excuse but for the life of me I could not get a way.  So I went straight home and prayed...and read...and prayed some more.  Woh Colossians kicked my tale a bit.  There is so much in that book that I had needed to hear and didn't want to admit.  Why I picked Colassians?  I feel it cheesey to say that God led me there but I don't have a better answer.  So as I read I felt like I needed to continuously read it over and over. But I felt like the still small voice was missing for a few things I really wanted answers for yesterday.  I know it's his timing and not mine but I was confident he was going to spell it out for me...today things happened today that only added to my confusion...was he testing me?  Challanging me to remain steadfast and faithful, to continue listening for him even if it hurts.  I don't know...so I sit...and try to be quiet...but the silence is so...silent.

      I almost hate to post what I am currently reading...because when I say what it is you're gonna think that i'm 'that girl' and I'm not.  I feel like I need to preface it with the reasons I am reading this book.  First of all, some of the guys in the 20somethings group I go to have read it and love the book...make references to it like its some secret boy book.  Second of all, I had a good guy friend of mine tell me I needed to read it.  So I picked it up and now am having a hard time putting it down.  The book is called 'Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul' by John Eldredge, written aimed at guys...but has been a real eye opener for me...growing up in a house of dominating woman...my poor father lost his spirit a bit.  We sucked it out of him...reading this book may save any male that comes in my life from doing the same.  I post this for one reason...because if I was a guy...I would have wanted some one to tell me to pick this book up.  To read it and regain the lost spirit...even if you don't think its gone.

      If I have to hear ..."I'll be there for you..." one more time, I may lose my mind.  I am fan of Friends...have been for the last 10 years but you can not even turn NBC on without hearing that theme song...over and over and over.  It's one of those that never leaves...I'm pretty sure I'll be singing it for 10 more years.  I have had my newest 'big' purchase for 7 days now.  The "Ionic Breeze" air purifiers.  For a little under 500 dollars you too can be the proud owner of clean air.   I will say they have pulled a lot of things of dust and what not out of the air and has made my place have a fresh sort of sense in the air.   However it is a bit sad I have to pay money for clean air.  Don't forget Mother's Day on Sunday.

      Wow...what a week.  First the minister that has been at my home church resigned after about 15 years..a total shocker to everyone in the congregation.  To make matters worse, he's going to another church down the road.  Today, the head of my division...the big man...the leader of the boys club, resigned...is going to a major competitor...and they are replacing him with a WOMAN!  GASP!  Triple shocker!  And to top it all off they fired the guy that sleeps (and snores mind you) in his chair all day.  Apparently you can only sleep all day for 15 years before you get the boot.

      So I had this new male interest.  I have been talking to him the past couple of weeks.  There was always something about him that I could never put my finger on.  He was very sweet, very understanding, very encouraging..very unmale like.  While I talked and talked about different things going on with me and I watched him sympathize and nod his head compassionately...i realize he wears A LOT of Abercrombie..now I hate to make assumptions about males wearing Abercrombie...but I live next door to an Abercrombie...I see what comes in and out of there.  He's a pretty good dresser too...and all of the sudden it starts to come together.  Understanding..sweet...Abercrombie...my love interests come to a screeching halt...he's has to be Gay...now that I think about it...often times when I am talking to him I feel like he may give me the...'Jazz Hands'...he's very show choirish...I hear the little voice in the back of my head saying...'Just Jack'  and suddenly I can not look at my love interest in the same way.  I have lost a great deal of attraction.     I hate to judge people or make assumptions but I think I'm right about this one.

      I love rainy Saturdays.  This past Saturday was one of them.  After a late night I got out of bed at 11 only to find my cable was out.  Which I was NOT to happy about to say the least.  I decided to download a movie off the internet...ahh the wonderful world of technology.  After watching that I took a nap until 3, put on the velour sweat suit to walk to Micky D's...the fact is that if I wasn't craving a cheese burger I probably would have never gotten dressed.  I did eventually clean up a little, got my summer clothes out, worked on the T-shirt quilt I am starting on...so it wasn't a total waste.  It was one of the most relaxing days I've had in a long time and I think they are needed every once in a while.  I blame it all on the fact that my parents left me.  They are on a cruise for their 30th wedding anniversary.  My dad didn't want to be the third wheel so I wasn't allowed to go and I'm not happy about it.  Such is life I guess.

      Tonight I went dancing again.  Let me explain the swing dance scene here.  First of all, from the first time I went out dancing I have always aspired to be one of the great dancers (heck I'd settle for good) I see dancing up a storm.  There are some unbelievable dancers here.  When you go out swing dancing you can definitely tell who the regulars are, who the wanna be's are, the newbee's, and who's not from around here.  I have really improved my dancing over the past 2 years and don't really know where I fit in the scene.  I don't know where other dancers place me nor where I place myself.  Tonight there was clearly a guy from out of town, initial assessments were that he was a decent dancer but definitely not one who is from around here (all of this before he ever hits the dance floor)...by now I know enough to tell the different swing styles, the different look, and familiar faces usually at first glance.  So when he does hit the floor I do see that he knows what he is doing and that he is probably an active dancer where ever he is from.  Half way through the night he asks me to dance.  We chat while dancing (which I will admit is much harder then chewing gum and walking...I am sure I will never master the art).  I find out he's from DC.  He then says something to me that may have been the biggest compliment I have ever received about my dancing...the crowd was a little thin tonight b/c of the rain and he says, "Where's everyone like you tonight?"...to those reading this you are waiting for the other shoe to fall, but you have already missed it.  He asked ME, where everyone like ME was tonight...meaning the good dancers....meaning that he catergorized me with the good dancers...me.  Wow!

      Peter: What if we're still doing this when we're 50?   Samir: It would be nice to have that kind of job security. ... Bob Slydell: If you would, would you walk us through a typical day, for you? Peter Gibbons: Yeah. Bob Slydell: Great. Peter Gibbons: Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late, ah, I use the side door--that way Lumberg can't see me, heh--after that I sorta space out for an hour. Bob Porter: Da-uh? Space out? Peter Gibbons: Yeah, I just stare at my desk, but it looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch too, I'd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work. ... Peter: The thing is, Bob, it’s not that I’m lazy. It’s just that I just don’t care.  Bob Porter: Don’t, don’t care?  Peter: It’s a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don’t see another dime. So where’s the motivation? And here’s another thing, Bob. I have eight different bosses right now!  Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon?  Peter: Eight bosses.  Bob Slydell: Eight?  Peter: Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That’s my real motivation - is not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y’know, Bob, it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired. ****************************************** I've seen this movie several times...but never has it hit the nail on the head as it has today...its a nice reminder that it's not just me.

      a nice normal guy walked me in the general direction of home on sunday night...whatever that is suppose to mean. i met this guy a few weeks ago and when i met him he was with his friend that dominated the conversation and talked to me way more then he did try as he might...the whole time his friend was talking i kept thinking i'd rather be talking to him...so this sunday, as I'm running late from spending the day w/ my parents...wind blown hair in a pony tail and cubs visor...sit down in the last row in the first available seat I can find...right next to my friend becca...which happened to also be right next to him...although as i stumbled over him I didn't notice him..so we stand for the famous meet and greet...and i turn to him and believe it or not actually remembered his name...i say my name again and he said he didn't recognize me with a hat on...which turns out is a pretty good disguise for me...he did however remember that i worked for IBM and some details I had told about work...so after group, we start talking, and talking and talking...and he asks me if I'm headed to grab ice cream w/ the rest of the group, i am not b/c...well i'm tired, and hungry and want to go home...he says he isn't either...then he asks me how I'm getting home...i say, sometimes I walk, sometimes i get a ride, sometimes i take the bus...he asks me which way I am headed...i say north...he is to, so he says we can head that way together...i am agreeable...so we walk and talk and what not..we hit his place first, he says he's actually going to let his sisters dog out and if i want to stop w/ him to get his keys he'll drive me the rest of the way home...okay...i agree that sounds like a good idea...so we run upstairs, he grabs some stuff and his keys and we head down to his car...we continue talking, having great conversation...he takes me home...says he'll be out of town a couple weekends but should be at church again on the 17th of JULY!  Okay, guess I'll see you in a month then...and that was it...an hour and a half and i'll see ya around  was it to much for me to think that he may want to get my number?  i'm not talking marriage here people...i'm talking coffee...we had a good night...right...if not he had ample time to get rid of me...i'm not the one that wanted to walk home together...he could have left me when we got to his apartment...i can't figure out if he really has totally no interest...or is just testin the waters...i'm so sick of hearing that though...i got enough water testers...i seriously was not born with the sense of having an sort of idea what the opposite sex is thinking...in fact, i usually am in denial right up to the part before we are actually 'something'...  This isn't even a big deal to me...i honestly don't even think that we would have much compatible...he's a nice guy, but he listens to NPR (not that that's a bad thing).. I'm just saying it would be nice to feel 'liked'...to know that i'm not repulsive...that i don't have a third eye or a uni-brow i wasn't aware of...is that to much for a girl to ask for?  I don't think so...

      her name was Wilma Painter...she couldn't have been more then 4 foot 5 but she was the sweetest, funniest, spit firer i ever met...altough we've gone to the same church almost the past 20 years i hadn't really met her until the last couple of years.  She was the only good thing about getting up to go to the early service with my parents.   Her cute and feisty self was always good for a quick laugh...the things that came out of her mouth sometimes would shock you...she always told me she was going to be looking for someone for me to marry...she said i needed to find myself a hillbilly b/c they were the best (she was originally from Tennessee)...she probably didn't even know my name, i never heard her call me anything but honey...but you couldn't help but fall in love with her...  Wilma was diagnosed with cancer a couple months ago...and late last night she passed away.  I will dearly miss her...i didn't know it would affect me like it has..i can't imagine never getting a hug on Sunday mornings...i know she has made the list of those I can't wait to see when i get past those pearly gates...so...So long for now Willma...and send me that hillbilly you were always talkin about...this blogs for you.

      No, not my mother...thats already happened...i'm talking about the 40something lady...the one that its hard to determine where work life stops and real life begins...the one who spent her whole life eating, breathing, and living her job...i swore i wouldn't be that lady...but as i stop to look at the past 2 weeks, besides the 40 part... i find frightening similarities...my 3 day a week gym routine has shriveled down to 1 visit in 14 days...i eat at my desk every day...i get there early...am the last one to leave...and as i sit here at 9:43 pm on a glorious thursday evening, it is taking all the power i have to keep my eyes open. i begin to wonder if when i'm 50, fat, and single, i can sue for the crappy work/life balance that the largest three letter computer company in the world provides for my dedicated soul...  ...that settles it...tomorrow i will leave early...

      So Sunday I'm laying on my couch all content...watching the Cubs game...dosing in and out of sleep when I am rudely interrupted my by cell phone...i try to settle back in but I can see that is not going to be very easy to do...i then realize that i shouldn't be wasting this wonderful day inside...so i jump up, grab my stuff for the beach and my roller blades and head out the door...i'm cruising down belden, lincoln park in sight when i see the light at the intersection change in my favor...i pick up the speed, trying to decide if i can make it there before i get the hand...when i find myself flying through the air...at this point someone put the slow motion on...i crash to the ground and pause while people, enjoying the wonderful weather, come running from every direction...i'm stunned, they fuss over me...someone finally asks if they can do anything...I say helping me up would be nice...they do so...i turn to look to see what had caused my down fall...a strip of the pavement had been removed and filled with gravel...which i clearly hadn't seen...luckily i had wrist guards on...I'm bruised up a bit, and if it hadn't been for the one piece of gravel that i landed on with my elbow I may have escaped pretty clean...who would have known that one piece of gravel embedded in ones elbow would cause so much pain...i continue to skate towards the lake, only to pause, look at the hole in my elbow before deciding to accept my defeat and return home to nurse my wounds...

      last week i rode to work with my dad...not an unusual circumstance for me...a normal routine when i spend the night at my parents...thursday on our way to work in the pouring rain he spots it...the north start, the glimmer of hope in the rainy dark morning...gas for $1.89...for that moment the world stopped as he quickly swirved into the gas station...he could not pass it buy, no matter that it was pouring, no matter that the commute was already going to be horrendous, no matter that he got gas on the way to work YESTERDAY, after all this was 5 cents cheaper then he paid the day before...'dad!' i protested, 'i will give you the quarter, please lets go.'  'No,' he says...'I have to top her off' ...we sit there, in the rain, while he gets his 3.75 gallons of gas for $7.09...for a big savings of 15 cents...was it really worth it he asks himself as he gets back in to the car...if he would have kept going and taken the quarter i offered before he stopped, he would have been up 10 more cents...

      i got some bad news at work today...a good friend of mine quit...the problem with this is that we shared a lot of responsibilities and helped each other out...our work overlapped in some circumstances...i knew that the news of her leaving meant a double work load for me...there was no doubt that they wouldn't replace her...just expect me to work double...this isn't the bad news...not even close...i got put on a project she was working on...with my ex.  i have had to do actual work for him for about an hour in the past 3 years...until now..300+ hours over the next 4.5 months.  We are both adults and I do realize that, but I do know that I hurt him and wounded his spirit and I also know that he isn't really over it...we haven't spoke, as in had an actual conversation since the beginning of february (with the exception of 2 cold sentences he IMed me today)...i have said before i do still feel a little guilty for the way things ended, but why this?  why is it the past can never stay in the past and that it's always coming back to haunt us?  why is it always the one most random thing that you never want to happen always happen? is god out to get me?  is he forcing me to deal with things in the past that are better left in the past? do i let it go, keep the next 300 hours of our working experience completely professional without any chit chat about what we are doing on the weekend? what's with the constant drama?

      last night i had a horrible headache...i lay in bed at 2:30 am staring out the window...knowing that it would not be a good morning...after a little help from excederin pm i finally drifted off into a sound slumber...until i heard something...at first i thought it was cicada that got in the house (strange though b/c we don't have cicada's around here right now) so i jump out of bed ready to kill what ever it is...i turn the light on...only the light doesn't come on...strange though b/c i see the time on the clock and if thats working the light should be also...i run to the hallway, flip the switch...it also won't turn on...now i'm freaked out...i finally figure out that i'm only dreaming of waking up...so i wake myself up...only to be a little freaked out about the lights not working...so i get up...decide i'll flip the switch just to reassure myself that everything is fine...there are no bugs...the lights will work and i can go back to sleep...only when i hit the switch the light really doesn't come on...so i'm freaked...i head down the hall...and a man grabs me and throws me to the floor...as i lay there the only thing i can think is that i'm awake...and i know this isn't a dream b/c i just woke up from a dream...and i could feel the carpet on my face and i rubbed it with my hand...if i was asleep i know i couldn't feel the carpet...the man is gone so i get up...i try to hit the light switch but of course it doesn't work...what am i going to do now...i run furiously around the house...surely one of these lights have to work...what has happened...and then i wake up...i am again back in my bed...i wasn't awake...i was dreaming...but am i dreaming now or not?  i have already faked myself out twice...as i lay there, heart racing, shaking...i turn over and look at the clock...it's on...but one thing for sure...i can't bring myself to turn the light on...

      So I went dancing yet again tonight...big surprise right?  Anyway, a friend of mine asked me if one of my ex was gay.  I asked him why he would ask that...he said he didn't really know the guy but from the times he did see him his gaydar was beeping a bit (okay he didn't put it exactly like that but that's what he meant).  He said the way he dressed, the spiky hair with an over abundance of gel...that sort of thing.  Hilarious as it may be I think that he may fall more under the definition of  urlLink metrosexual.   Let's go through a quick exercise shall we? "young man with money to spend", CHECK "living in or within easy reach of a metropolis", CHECK  "spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance and lifestyle", DOUBLE CHECK "where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are", CHECK "he has clearly taken himself as his own love object and pleasure as his sexual preference", CHECK, CHECK  If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck...its a pretty good chance its a duck.  Any questions?

      Tonight I did laundry.  Only our machine in the condo building was broken so I was forced to drag all my dirty belongings across the street to the laundry mat.  Now on a normal day I would have just been disgruntled and would do it another night...however today was one of those times when you don't have an option on whether you do your laundry or not...when all your emergency unmentionables have been utilized.  I don't even know when the last time I washed clothes was...thats how bad it was...so I hauled everything except about 2 pairs of pants that don't fit and a couple unmatching socks, across the street, to share my dirty laundry with the rest of the world.  As I sat there, waiting to add the fabric softener in the rinse cycle only...I looked around...everyone in a laundry mat has a story...I can see it in their face...a random group of people...forced in the same building...differant status...differant jobs...Different lives...all here for a common goal...yet I wonder what the man who obviously wears boxer briefs is thinking about as he watches the dryer go around and around...or why the lady in the washer across from mine proudly hangs her bras on the the long pole coming out of the cart with wheels while the other hides hers in a little stack in the corner of her basket...what does that mean about each of them?  how about the man that shoves everything he can fit in one washer while the next man sorts very specifically in three Different washers. Which makes me stop and look at my own dirty laundry...what does it say about me?

      Apple is already on my bad side.  I got my ipod today...only to open it up and find out that I can't use it. I love spending entirely to much money only to find out...oh wait...you need to buy one more stuff  before you can even start using the darn thing.  I'm sure it said that the USB connector wasn't included...somewhere amongst the small print...but don't you think they should offer it as an option upon check out, after all, most of the world isn't mac lovers...   I've talked to a few people who have done the same thing and were a bit annoyed  Last night I lost a filing and got to spend this morning at the dentist...tonight I sit and watch my ipod..uselessly laying there...both cost entirely to much money...and only one is doing its job.

      Often with the running around and the craziness of everything, I forget why I love living in this city.  It's days like today that I stop to remember...a last minute Cubs game...cramming into public transpo at 2:10 to still make the 2:20 game.  Today was a great day...work has been stressful and a joy sucker but i fell into last minute tickets and was able to sneak out early to enjoy the classic confines of Wrigley...to top it off...we won...   urlLink    Every days, a great day for a ball game.&nbsp; urlLink

      3:30 am After tossing and turning a bit, I have a sudden urge to get out of bed...i do so and for some reason walk right out of my bedroom and down the hall...as if I am headed there to get something...I walk straight to the front door and for some reason check the lock...its unlocked...I am in disbelief because I always lock the door when I close&nbsp;it behind me.&nbsp; I look around to key possible rapist hiding places and didn't see any so I go get back in bed...trying to remember why I went into the living room in the first place...i can't recall...decide that I have to get back up this time and turn the light on to make sure that I didn't just unlock the door instead of locking it...its locked...  I realized this morning that I was awake and not dreaming this...what made me get out of bed...and what in the world made me check the front door?&nbsp; I would have never dreamt (no pun intended) that the door would have been unlocked.

      Tuesday  4:00 am  a crashing noise wakes me up...i lay frozen in my bed...i sleep with my door cracked just slightly to keep the porch light from shining in my eyes...so i can't even view down the hall to see if i notice anything...i lay there...still...trying to justify the noise...trying to decide what i am going to do...do i ignore it and stay where I am...do I get up and find the source...i lay there...listening...for breathing...for foot steps...for subsequent crashes...nothing...i decide there is no way i can lay there and just fall back asleep...i creep slowly down the hall...flip on the kitchen light...look around...nothing...check out any crack big enough for an intruder...nothing...search the dishes in the sink to see if something could have settled and crashed...nothing...i know that i heard a crashing noise...after all it did wake me up.  I decided that it had to be the dishes in the sink to pacify myself...so i turn around to crawl back in bed...but i stop by the bathroom on the way back...there it is..in floor of the shower...my heart races...i'm filled with anger...the suction cup on my razor holder lost its suction...

      I got back out on the roller blades again...the first time since 'the incident' last month.&nbsp; Although the blurry images of hurling though the air were still in my mind, i felt like I had no other choice but to get back out there.&nbsp; It was Baptism Sunday at my church...7 am Sunday morning on the lake front...easiest, quickest way together while sleeping as long as possible was to break out the blades.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did indeed, and found my new favorite time to roller blade...no one's around...no traffic on the road to the lake or on the lake front at 6:45 am...just me...the ipod...and I...cruising down the lakefront...it was cooler then usual...the 'Jesus rays' peaking through the clouds...the city before me...the beach,&nbsp; freshly drug...with no foot prints....and 45 lives to be changed with a quick dip in the lake.&nbsp; As we sit...in almost silence for a group of 300 people...watching as each individual...man and woman hand in hand...son with his father...mother...daughter...friend...the old...the young...enter into the water...this year with a chill in the air and the waves rolling in...it wouldn't stop any of them..."find me in the river...find me on my knees...I've walked against the water...now i'm waiting if you please...we've longed to see the roses...but never felt the thorns...and bore our pretty crowns...but never paid the price...find me in the river...find me there...find me on my knees with my soul laid bare...even though you're gone and I'm cracked and dry...find me in the river...i'm waiting here."&nbsp; ~Delirious?

      Often confused with 'The Simple Life'&nbsp;... as I sit here at 3:08 pm on Saturday afternoon I look back at what I have accomplished this morning...I got up at 10:45, talked to my mom till 11...laid on the couch for an hour...made breakfast, ate... made deviled eggs and sweet tea...not sure why...but kinda was feeling like both.&nbsp; Laid back on the couch...watched TV for another couple of hours...fell asleep...woke up..watched the Cubs game...&nbsp; I don't know how everyone else views my day, but it has been for me its be a perfect day...I've done what I wanted, when I wanted and nothing more...and as I was talking to my mother this afternoon I think I scared her b/c I enjoyed it so much...the first thing she said..the longer you live alone, the harder it will be to live with someone else...so what?&nbsp; then shouldn't I enjoy this time to the fullest?&nbsp; I think her big fear is that I will like it so much I will never marry...but even for all the 'wonderful' things i hear about being married...i think the same thing can be said for being single.&nbsp; I'm not saying that I never want to get married...thats not really it, its just about being happy where I'm at...would she rather me call her crying and whining to her that i'm so sad I'm all alone and I'm never going to find anyone...i doubt it.&nbsp; Right now I have really been blessed with contentment, with being a strong independent girl who can take care of myself and doesn't mind spending a day doing everything I want...but I also think I have the capability to love, and to share it with another person, and i think thats a pretty good place to be.

      my life, a living soap opera, not self appointed either...friend appointed...&nbsp;this week is one of those weeks that you leave...never wanting to remember again, yet never able to forget.&nbsp; It pretty much started going down hill on Wednesday.   Wednesday 7:15 am&nbsp; Got up, got ready to go  Wednesday 7:37 am&nbsp; Head out the door  Wednesday 7:45 am Arrive at train station...start getting migraine, turn around, go home  Wednesday 11:30 am &nbsp;Crawl out of dark cave...with a 'workable' headache  Wendesday 3:59 pm Boss sends Instant Message...wants to chat...  Wednesday 4:00 pm&nbsp;Phone rings for&nbsp;interview&nbsp;for job&nbsp;I really really would like to have  Wensday 4:01 pm Dodge boss  Wednesday 4:22 pm Finish interview...Unsatisfied   Thursday 9:00 am Team meeting  Thursday 9:37 am random annoucement in team meeting that 'tulsa most eligible bachelor is being taken off the list...after all he got engaged this past weekend'....m.e.b. being my ex boyfriend...from 7 months ago...hes engaged...engaged...OMG is all I can say at this point  Thursday 2:00 pm No news about job...  Thursday 4:00 pm&nbsp; The 'news' about 'mr. mostselfappointedmosteligiblebacheor of the crazies' sets in...i broke it off so I shouldn't even have an opinion...but it does sting a little...that for being 'in love' with me, I was so easily and quickly replaced...cheapens it a bit..stings...replay of the last few weeks of the 'relationships' starts going through my head...cheapens it even more...go home..who can work at this point?   Friday 4:07 pm&nbsp; Blogging...No call......probably one of the only circumstances where no good is never good news.&nbsp; How glad am I that its Friday?   Why Georgia...why?

      So I haven't posted in a while...I have blogged in my head on various occasions the last week but never actually sat down to let it out.&nbsp; So here it goes...  &nbsp;  spontaneity is not my forte, and those that know me love and respect me for this...okay fine it mainly drives people nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on vacation all week last week, and although I had a great week, I felt like doing something out of the ordinary for me.&nbsp; So Last Friday, within 10 minutes, I bought a plane ticket, packed a bag, headed out the door, and hitched a ride (not with a stranger or anything) to 'the nati'...I don't do things like this, its not in my nature.&nbsp; Now I had considered the possibilities earlier that week...so I really can't proclaim unadulterated spontaneity.&nbsp; Baby steps though right?&nbsp;  A weekend at the Jones is always a good get away from me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure why but I feel it is a great escape.&nbsp; Maybe its the life without rules and regimented schedules that is freeing to me...who knows. &nbsp;I arrived late Friday night, and at 1am&nbsp;Steve and I&nbsp;went to the&nbsp;Waffle&nbsp;House...ahhh, the&nbsp;Waffle House...it was my first visit...Steve is convinced that I hated it...he is wrong.&nbsp; Although with first impressions the word 'dirty' comes to mind...I&nbsp;am able to get over it...the Waffle House is like its own little world...kinda like a time warp...with the retro fixtures still in place since the joint opened.&nbsp; There's something about it...about stepping back into the old 'diner' ....who would have guessed the small rectangle resturant that sites off the side of the road at most interstate exits would have quite so much character...no technology...no bells or whistle...2 baskets of eggs...just a resturant...open all night...serving breakfast.&nbsp; The clientele, the wait staff, the famous 'waffle'&nbsp; (which really would have a hard time beating a eggo in my book), crispy bacon, hot coffee,&nbsp;2 friends,&nbsp;living differant lives,&nbsp;having breakfast in the middle of the night...maybe spontaneity isn't that bad after all.

      i should be tired...i shopped at a 'quaint' little town in west bufoo ALL day with my mom and sister...left at 9:30 got home about 7pm.  I thought maybe it was the large dunkin donuts coffee I had for dinner...but that was almost 6 hours ago.  I have already tried to lay down and find myself staring at the ceiling...praying...thinking...looking at the clock to see no time has passed...praying...finding a good song on the ipod...thinking a little more...maybe i'm over tired...maybe the second wind has kicked in and I need to ride it out...i don't know.  I'm worried about a friend...worried that work is falling apart and will be a disaster when I get back on monday...worried that i may harm my mother if she tries to analyze every male friend i have in my life as a potential husband...these are all things going through my head as i stare at the ceiling.  I know worrying isn't going to fix any of these things and is not what i need to be doing with my concerns but i'm having a really hard time doing much else...but find it funny that out of the thousands of songs that i have on my ipod..Jars of Clay, I Need You is playing... *************************** Strangely out of place There is a life filing this room where no one would follow before I can't deny it burns me up inside I fan the flames to melt Away my pride  Do I want shelter from the rain Or the rain to wash me away?  I need you, I need you, I need you I need you, I need you, I need you You're all I'm living for  I might sound like a fool But I think I felt you moving Closer to me Face to the ground To hide the fatal cut I fight the weight I feel you lift me up You are the shelter from the rain And the rain to wash me away  Face to the ground To hide the fatal cut I fight the weight Feel you lift me up Can't deny it burns me up inside I fan the flames to melt away My pride Only had a second to spare But all the time in the world To know you're there You are the shelter from the rain And the rain to wash me away  I need you, I need you, I need you You're all I'm living for All I'm living for All I'm living for All I'm living for You're all I'm living for ************************************  Do I want shelter from the rain?  Or the rain to wash me away?  Why is that question so hard some times when the answer seems so clear?

      so i am 4 days into my week vacation and i have only checked my work mail once and that was only b/c i said i would send some guy some information on Friday and I never sent it so I sent it on Sunday.  I thought i was going to have a hard time keep myself away and feeling guilty about it...but actually, i don't even know where my laptop is and have no care if I ever find it again...EVER.   In fact i hope it gets trampled on or thrown out the window or maybe even drowned in the hot tub.  Instead of making myself stay away from it, I'm repulsed by the fact that i may have to turn it on next monday.  Its  beautiful thing really...well at least for another 5 days...then i may have a problem.

      So every time my Aunt sees me she tells me how wonderful her neighbor is and how she would love to set the 2 of us up. For months and months I have been hearing about Paul...Paul this, and Paul that...Pauls a cop, Pauls so good looking, Paul cooks, on and on and on and on...tonight she gets online..."Hey Coey (dont ask, thats her nickname for me)took your senior picture outside tonight to show my cop friend" MY SENIOR PICTURE being the key phrase there...7 YEARS AGO! 7...that was 1997, actually 96 when I actually got the pictures taken...i had bangs...i had bad taste in clothing...i don't even think i wore make-up...the only people that like their senior pictures are those that still think high school was the best 4 years of their entire life...embarrassed doesn't even really cover it.

      My ipod...my new best friend...comes with me everywhere...on the train, on the walk to work, on my lunch break, at the office, basically everywhere I go.  My favorite moments with the ipod are those when a song comes on that is perfect for the current situation. Some of the best moments...'Independent Woman' as I step on the elevator and through the office doors...'Footloose' as I step off the elevator heading home ("8 Hours? For What?")...a good ole Frank Sanatra tune as I walk around downtown...'It's a Beautiful Day' on the way to the lake front on a hot summer day...its moments like these that I can't even remember what life was without the ipod...but who would want to?

      No concrete fell at Wrigley on Friday.  Although tons of people were wearing hard hats mocking the situation which I found very funny.  I tried to find a picture to post but I was unsuccessful.   The nets that were put up were not a big deal.  Pretty much just over the heads of those in the sky boxes...you wouldn't have even noticed if it wasn't for the ruckus.
