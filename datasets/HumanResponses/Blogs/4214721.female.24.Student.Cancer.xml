      Generally I do not think that I ever want to get off the dole.  But then I see what I could turn in to, and it inspires me once again (college diploma anyone?).  Someday I will get a job that compensates me reasonably well and doesn't atrophy my brain.  Not right away, mind you, but I will not allow myself to become a vacuous anorexic who sponges shamelessly and mercilessly off of my father.  I will be a better person and a better (read: more financially independent) daughter.  Probably just not this year.

      I do not like small children.  It is not your children specifically that I do not like (though there are those that I do not like in particular), but rather pretty much all children under the age of about 7 who run amok and scream and yell for hours on end, dirtying themselves and their environment.  Why parents, and especially older parents, have to take it so personally is beyond me.  Take my cousin Ross, a man who is about as old as my parents (i.e., easily late 40s, early 50s).  He seems to take it as a personal affront that I do not like small children and become visibly pained when surrounded by TWENTY of them- including his two- for the afternoon at a birthday party.  His response?  Not to accept the fact that not all of us women are maternal and long to hug and kiss all little ones till we can smother our own (or ignore them, as many of my older cousins seem to do with their late in life progeny), but rather to mock this aspect of my personality.  I used to think that Ross behaved like an asshole because he drank so much in order to deal with Uncle Morty (an understandable reaction to Uncle Morty).  However, after Uncle Morty's absence this afternoon and Ross's behavior, I am beginning to suspect that the alcohol actually makes him nicer than his sober self.  And while I am on the subject of "more mature" parents, why is it that the older the parent, the less interested they are in their children?  One would think that a person who waited so long, for whatever reason, to have children would mean that they actually want this child and are wise enough to understand the responsibility involved in having one.  But not my family.  Rather, the elder parents virtually ignore their children, and they see family gatherings as opportunities to dump their children in someone else's living room and then promptly forget about them, while they then proceed to scream for the next 4 hours.  And the younger parents actually look after their children, and try to keep them from breaking things and screaming.  It's an interesting and unexpected turn of events if you ask me.  And don't try to tell me that older parents are too tired to always be chasing after their kids.  If they're that tired, they should have thought of that before they were 49 and decided that now would be a good time to somehow get yourself twins.  Basically, I think that if you are going to ignore your child, why did you bother having one?   Have I mentioned how much I dislike the screaming that goes hand in hand with the small children?  Why must they be so loud?

      In class this morning, we translated the first two paragraphs of an academic article that seemed like it was eventually going to be a cautionary tale about the devastation of globalization. It's hard to tell after simply two paragraphs, but the style of the piece and the use of an obscure African proverb are pretty good clues a la Ginzburg about where it was heading. Save two of us, myself included among the two, no one could understand the selection as it was written in pretentious academic prose, the kind all of us should be aiming for. One classmate claimed that she never wrote like that and had no intention of ever doing so. I replied, "You just need more professional development."  Is it strange that the entire class found this funny but that no one else outside of graduate students in the liberal arts will ever see the humor in this? Is my mind expanding or contracting as I further my education?
