      lots more about the twenty-tongued EU in the news today. from tomorrow, it's an amorphous beast. hurrah.  and there's a really interesting article about the translation of a Canadian book for kids, Mmmm cookies, into  Ojibwa . The rights were given for free, in order to try and help preserve the Ojibwa language. Apparently, when a language starts to die, one of the first things to go is children's literature... the article doesn't explain why, and i don't really understand why because you'd think that the orality of kid's stories would at least keep them alive a little longer than sweeping wuthering-heights style novels.  the canadians are doing quite a lot to try and keep this language alive, and have several immersion programs in which these books will be used.  i feel ashamed. i had never heard of obijwa until today.  also, i'm cutting and pasting the article because it's only available through lexis-nexis: The Leader-Post (Regina, Saskatchewan) April 30, 2004 Friday Final Edition   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ont. (CP) -- The Ojibwa translation of Robert Munsch's book Mmm Cookies -- or Mmm Pkwezhgaanhsak -- was launched with a "clang, clang, rattle-bing-bang" at Sault College of Applied Arts and Technology.   It's the first of three published and seven unpublished works by the children's author that the community college was given permission to translate at no cost.  Giving away the rights for the translation helps preserve a First Nations language, Munsch said this week as he helped get the book's launch underway.  Two of his books have already been published in Mohawk, but Munsch said it can be an uphill battle when children are surrounded by a "sea of English."  "When a language starts to die, one of the first things that dies are kids' stories, because people think they're trivial," Munsch said.  Students from Sault Ste. Marie's three school boards were invited to fill the gym as Munsch and retired Sault College aboriginal counsellor Barb Nolan read from the newly translated story in both English and Ojibwa.  The children went from listening raptly, as an animated Munsch told a few of his tales, to shouting along with the popular refrain from Mortimer, the Guelph-based writer's first story about a boy who refuses to go to sleep.  Josephine Pelletier, of Wikwemikong Unceded First Nation on Manitoulin Island, provided the translation for Mmm Pkwezhgaanhsak, and has already finished translations of two more books: We Share Everything and Andrew's Loose Tooth.  The translated books will be used for Sault College's new Ojibwa immersion program, and could be shipped out to other Ontario schools which run similar immersion programs.

      Here is an article about how difficult it is to find foreign (original language) fiction in London,  urlLink Foreign literature should not be a closed book .  I know I have often felt like to buy foreign fiction, you just have to go to the country itself, because it is so hard to find. Does anyone know of any good foreign language bookshops? Anywhere in the U.S.?

      as many of you already know, this administration here in the US is pretty dumb. The trade embargo fiasco made me angry enough to write to the NY Times, but the amazing  urlLink circumference  magazine has gone one step further: "As many of you have heard, and according to Democracy Now!, The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control recently declared that American publishers cannot edit works authored in nations under trade embargoes which include Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Cuba. As editors of cirumference, a journal founded on principles of free and open exchange, we want to respond to this issue in the most direct way that we can. We would like to dedicate a substantial section of our second issue to poetry from these countries."   so go to the circumference website... and submit!

      For Italian speakers: Here is an article in l'Unita,  urlLink "Lo scrittore e la sua ombra" , which discusses the state of literary translation in Italy. It seems that Italians have many of the same issues and concerns as we in America do: translators are underpaid, undervalued; translators sometimes over domesticate foreign works, often because publishers encourage/force them to do so.  This article also brought my attention to some interesting new books about translation, in particular  urlLink  Di seconda mano. Né un saggio, né un racconto sul tradurre letteratura  , by Laura Bocci, a sort of hybrid work I am very eager to read.

      "Why say 'coffee break' instead of 'pausa caffe,'" he asked with a laugh, "when Italian coffee is so much better than English coffee?"   Exactly!!! This is the subject brought up in this article  urlLink Italy Struggles to Keep the Mother Tongue Pure , about the disturbingly strong influence of the English language on the Italian. Unlike, for example, in France, the Italian language police haven't been doing much to keep Italian Italian. Is there anything wrong with that? I am undecided.  It seems like a double edged sword- learning other languages is good, right? Perhaps it's different in cases like this because it's not about learning another language but rather having a foreign language take over your own. And especially English and its evermore encroaching hegemony. But I guess we translators are fighting the good fight by translating stuff into English, right?

      Irrational (or "feminine") Nouns in Arabic  "In the dialogue in Section 4, the man refers to the four languages the woman knows, using the separate pronoun (hiya), 'she,' which is singular feminine.  He asks (ma'a hiya?).  The reason for using (hiya) is that all nonrational (or non-human) nouns are usually referred to in the singular feminine regardless of gender.  That is, the plural noun (kootoob), which is masculine, is referred to by (hiya), (haada), and (tilaka), which are used to refer to singular feminine entities."  from _Ahlan wa Sahlan: Functional Modern Standard Arabic for Beginners_.   I wonder if it is the same in Hebrew-- is that why the monster was a "she" in Tamar's translation?

      Thanks for creating this blog and for the invitation to join. As a French translator living in Montreal, I am currently working on informing myself about the industry of literary translation in North America. I just found about the International Literary Market Place, a directory of all players in the US industry, including the subsidiary rights managers. Did you know about it? I haven't had a look at it yet, but I found that the latest edition is available at university libraries. This might be useful for information about translation rights for us literary translators... If anyone knows about  the equivalent for the Canadian industry, I could use the info, by the way.   Info about ILMP :  urlLink here . Have a wonderful day, Nicky, Jamie, Eric. I guess we will soon be too numerous for me to know the names!

       so maybe i'm just cynical, but whenever you have articles about machine translation  in the  urlLink  christian science monitor  experts saying (i.e.) ""Individual words are very ambiguous, but whole phrases, especially in a particular context of use, are not really ambiguous," then i understand that it is little wonder that we translators are so invisible. if we can be replaced by much cheaper (and less demanding, i'm sure) devices such as the Phraselator (TM). But then again, maybe not: "fully natural conversations - two-way translations - are "a very daunting problem," says Dr. Frederking of Carnegie Mellon. Even human translators aren't perfect at it," he adds."

       breakthrough literary translator self-publishes georges sand's  the black city , hitherto unavailable in english.     urlLink tina kover , a "young literary translator" has taken a brave step and self-published this george sand work with  urlLink  trafford , one of the companies that have started to do publishing on demand. The article says that "Since publishing resources for literary translations are limited, Kover took advantage of an innovative process in order to self-publish The Black City." is this a viable way forward for literary translation? is it the only way we're going to get more work from other languages across into blinkered english? or will it just serve to lower the status of literary translations, seeing as so many people still see 'vanity publishing' as just that, and nothing more.

      There's a really interesting show about translation into Farsi on  urlLink Npr ... did you know the translation of Joyce's Ulysses is still under review there and hasn't been published?  More info: "Iran does not abide by international copyright laws, which means that foreign books get translated and sold without permission from, or payment to, authors. Commentator Firoozeh Dumas heard that there were 19 versions of the latest Harry Potter book on the Iranian market. She didn't want her own book to be translated badly, so she hired her own translator. It's called Funny in Farsi."

      I'm just testing. Not sure I've got all the technical side of this right. Nicky, there's no harm in plugging things shamelessly if you're a literary translator. No one else will do it for you. The more forums (or fora) there are for us poor starving garret-ridden literary translators to do a bit of self-publicity, the better. But I think that maybe literary translation into English is gradually being nudged into the limelight by various initiatives. A pity I didn't find your sex and death earlier, as I'm just translating excerpts from a novel involving just these matters.  Won't say much more now as I don't know whether this will work.

      i am going to shamelessly publicize our own journal here, and suggest that any translators who have not already perused  urlLink eXchanges  find their way there now. our current issue is on the theme of SEX & DEATH; issue three will be on the theme of MADNESS & CIVILIZATION and the submission deadline is april 30 -- click on 'call for submissions' on the site. we publish the original alongside the translation and welcome translations both into and out of the english language. oh, and you need flash to view it... apologies to anyone who has not downloaded it yet (it's free) but it's the only way to display non-roman alphabets and the roman alphabet together on the same page and ensure that everyone can see them! shameless plug over. thank you.

      according to the  urlLink christian science monitor , sofia coppola's academy-award winning  Lost in Translation  has offended many people in Japan, where it opened last weekend. it seems that a significant number of japanese see the film as perpetrating well-worn stereotypes, portraying tokyo as a place lonelier than any other and the characters as little more than caricatures. sofia coppola, for her part, claims she intended the film as a "valentine to tokyo."

       ITALIAN  report: a brief summary of new Italian writing in English translation  If you are interested in Italian fiction, the two most important American presses to check out are  urlLink Italica Press  and  urlLink Steerforth Italia . Italica's most interesting recent publications are  After the War: A Collection of Short Fiction by Postwar Italian Women , which includes a wide span of work by women, since the collection gathers by age and not by genre; certainly it is a good taste of what Italian women have been writing in the last 25 years. Italica also has a new anthology called  Italian Environmental Literature: An Anthology , which mines the whole 20th century for prose, poetry, and essays by a wide range of writers. Penguin has, in the last year, published 4 novels by popular contemporary Sicilian writer Andrea Camilleri, who is worth checking out as well, although he writes of crime and occasionally the mafia, his prose is spare and lovely, and the translation is bound to be interesting as well, as the translator has had to deal with rendering the Sicilian dialect.

      "If a work does not compel us," [Fagles] said, quoting Yves Bonnefoy, the French poet and translator, "it is untranslatable.'' Dr. Fagles continued: "When Andromache in the Iliad laments the death of her husband, Hector, she foresees the future life of their son without a father. This moved me deeply. I lost my father when I was 14. The lines from Homer hit close to the bone."

      Quote from   urlLink The Atlantic  , June 2004. “ urlLink Offshoring the Audience " (note italics):  “Here, alas, is the virus laying waste to modern Hollywood movies. What do, say, the Batman and Matrix pictures have in common, besides banality? Just for openers, insipid, infrequent dialogue.  Why take the trouble to bang out good lines—supposing one can—if they'll only be mistranslated for their real target markets, abroad?  Both these movies could have been silents if they weren't so loud. They're overbearing, carelessly told, and gang-written into incomprehensibility. Small wonder they were tepidly welcomed in the United States. Americans at the movies are guilty of the same mistake in the early twenty-first century that grown-ups made at the movies in the 1980s: supposing that the pictures are made for them.”  Interesting, provocative logic; but I really don't think it is the reason for bad dialogue in movies. I mean, WHAT do you expect to see in a translation when the original is bad to begin with??? And there is always the possibility that the dialogue is SO BAD that no matter what the translator does, it's just going to sound BETTER. Anyway, just shows how we're unappreciated—Oh yeah, blame the translation!  (By the way, did anybody notice how gaunt and ghastly Tony Blair looked on that cover...though he has every right to look that way...i wonder how they got to use that picture...america's frail, tired, stressed out partner...definitely not good advertising...for washington, at least.)

      finally someone's actually concerned enough about the whole trade embargo/publishing fiasco to write an  urlLink opinion piece  about it. this is an issue which, of course, directly affects not only literary translators but publishers and editors as well. for a while there, it looked like we could be facing up to ten years in jail just for correcting a spelling mistake in a translation from farsi. sigh.  for those who might not know about this, here's a taster from the office of foreign assets control archives: "Activities such as the reordering of paragraphs and sentences, correction  of syntax, grammar, and replacement of inappropriate words by U.S. persons, prior to publication,  may result in a substantively altered or enhanced product, and is therefore prohibited."  Oh! and this one: "Despite Berman's 1988 amendment, which was intended to prevent such  use of authority, OFAC asserts its responsibility to regulate the publishing industry. "It's  illegal to provide a service for a sanctioned country," Millerwise says. "This isn't something  new that we just came up with."

      This, apparently, is the work of the  Independent on Sunday 's poet in residence, Martin Newell. It's entitled  HELEN OF TROY - THE ESSEX TRANSLATION (AFTER HOMER) and it's really quite funny. But maybe only if you're from the isles...  And so after a week's run of plastering work in Sparta Priam's boy, Paris, got in a sesh with the guv, Menelaus And, with her consent, copped off with his bird, Helen. Well tasty. Long hair. Lovely face. Legs up to her neck.  They got a smash & grab back to his and ... say n'more. Menelaus's bruv, Agamemnon, got well humpty over this, It being considered that Paris may have had a rep'n'that But this was pissing in the Stella and calling it "tops". Agamemnon now had to get a crew up to get it sorted. Words were had about it in some of the livelier drinkers And some mushes who were a bit handy got on board. After a lot of giving it all that, they went on the mission. A fleet of Escorts. Tooled up. Everyone in good order. They was barely out of the motors before it kicked off But if the parking had been a nightmare, it was nothing Compared to the door policy at The Troy, mate. Even Achilles, their top boy, after nine years of it Seemed to be flagging. This weren't just a smart/casual. And The Troy was no wendy-house. Far from it, geezer. Hector, the head monkey on the door, was a right yahoo. Totally lost it and threatened to torch all their motors. Achilles said he definitely wasn't having any of that, Got stuck into the ruck and put Hector out of business. That put the Trojans off their nosebag, for starters, but Then Achilles went down. It looked like it was all over But they steamed The Troy anyway. Done the bouncers. Left the place torched. But not really a result. As such. Not if it took ten years. The trip home was bloody rubbish. Rowing among theirselves all the way. Weather was crap. And Helen? What can you say? Can't live with 'em ...

      CALL FOR PAPERS  Deadline: MAY 15TH  Institute for Social, Cultural and Policy Research, University of Salford and Department of Italian Studies, University of Reading with the support of the Italian Cultural Institute  Value and Visibility: Poetic Translations across Italy and Britain in the Twentieth Century  September 10 and 11, 2004 Institute of Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London  Papers are sought for this two-day conference. The conference will create a forum for scholarly debate on poetic translations in Italy and the UK during the Twentieth Century, and aims to help reshape current research trends within translation studies. Three topics have been identified for debate: 1) the politics of translation (high culture versus popular culture; commodification; mass education); 2) translation and the development of the literary language  (relationships between linguistic registers and social class and gender; the breakdown or the endorsement of the opposition between literary and everyday language); 3) links between translation and community (the role of the translator as the bridge between the foreign and the familiar; how translation defines historical, social, and literary periodisation; editorial policies and their relation to reading communities). The conference will unite leading specialists in English, Italian, and Comparative Literature and outstanding younger contributors on the subject. By bringing together international scholars in London and developing material for a published volume, this conference aims to encourage comparative research across departments of English and Modern Languages and stimulate interest in courses on translation studies.  Keynote Speakers:   George Steiner (Churchill College, University of Cambridge, UK)  Lawrence Venuti (Temple University, USA)  Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo (University of Padua, Italy)  Michael Schmidt (Carcanet Press; PN Review; Manchester Metropolitan University, UK)  Anna Dolfi (University of Florence, Italy)  Jeffrey Wainwright (Manchester Metropolitan University, UK)  Carla Locatelli (University of Trento, Italy)  Please send a 500 words abstract of your paper to d.caselli@salford.ac.uk and to d.lapenna@rdg.ac.uk BY MAY 15TH Conference Organisers: Dr. Daniela La Penna (Dept. of Italian Studies, University of Reading) and Dr. Daniela Caselli (School of English, Sociology, Politics and Contemporary History, Institute for Social  Cultural and Policy Research, University of Salford)  Conference Venue: Institute of Romance Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of London Conference fees: £25 per day standard; £10 per day for members of the IRS and concessions (student, retired unemployed); £5 per day for graduate students in a department subscribing to the Institute of Romance Studies.

      here's an article in the  urlLink guardian  about flora drew's translation of ma jian's the noodle maker. it certainly gives more visibility to the translator than is usual, even mentioning the fact that she had no prior experience in literary translation. which is great, although i fear the journalist may just be mentioning her because she's his partner, or literary handmaiden as they'd have us believe. but maybe not. the really interesting thing is that she translates in parallel to his writing...

      It seems like the general public has a fairly underdeveloped understanding of translation. This was my initial impression of reading the article " urlLink After 25 yrs, translator still learns new things from each translation ", which was mentioned in another blog  urlLink The Elegant Variation . It was, in my opinion, a very simple, amateurish account of Toshiki Taguchi's experience of translating novels from English into Japanese. (He has translated some 150 novels and is known as a translator of books by Lawrence Block.) Of course, the article could have been "too easy" because it was a translation into English from the Japanese (which I suspect it is), or the writer had yet to grasp the subtleties of the English language (which I suspect is his or her second language). Still, it frustrates me that translation is only understood by and conveyed to readers in such oversimplifying and often ambiguous terms. And the sheer number of translations Toshiki Taguchi has published is also, in a way, misleading--it somehow implies that translating is "easier" than "writing." I mean, could anyone imagine a "serious" writer having already published 150 novels (with more to come)?

       st peter becomes rocky; mother of god now known as maggie; fornication ok with the man upstairs   This has to be my favourite bible translation yet. The  As Good As New  bible, translated by former baptist minister John Henson, has been approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who lauds it as "a vehicle for thinking and worshipping that is fully earthed."   Within its pages, we find nicknames galore: St Peter is Rocky; Mary Magdalene, Maggie and Barabas, Barry. A few choice excerpts are below; for more information go to the story at  urlLink WorldNetDaily . Let's go get dipped!   Matthew 26:69-70   Authorized version: "Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, 'Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.' But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."   New: "Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'"    1 Corinthians 7:8-7   KJV: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."   New: "If you know you have strong needs, get yourself a partner. Better than being frustrated."     Mark 1:4   Authorized version: "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."   New: "John, nicknamed 'The Dipper,' was 'The Voice.' He was in the desert, inviting people to be dipped, to show they were determined to change their ways and wanted to be forgiven."

      CALL FOR PAPERS   27th Annual ALTA Conference October 27-30, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada Session Organizer: Anna Barker   anna-barker@uiowa.edu  "The Word in Language is Half Someone Else's: Translator as the "Other" Author in Russian Literature."   As Mikhail Bakhtin pointed out in his Discourse and the Novel, "the word in language is half someone else's." No other field proves this to be the case more than the field of translation studies. Be it Ivan Turgenev, Constance Garnett, Boris Pasternak or Vladimir Nabokov, all of these translators became active contributors to the "afterlife" of the books they "exported" out of Russia or brought into the Russian literary environment. The re-creation of a literary text involves both a distantiation from the language and culture of the original and a simultaneous bridging of the two texts which occurs, according to Walter Benjamin, because of the essential "kinship" between languages. Does this kinship extend to the author and the translator? Does the author/translator relationship acquire a singular intensity in the Russian context? This session will focus on the role of the translator in the Russian literary tradition, both past and present. Papers on the reception and dissemination of Russian literature in the West are also welcome.

Otherwise known as:  Rage --       Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles,       murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,       hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,       great fighters' souls, but made their bodies carrion,       feasts for the dogs and birds,       and the will of Zeus was moving towards its end.

The journalist not only interviews Larissa Volokhonsky, but talks about the team's translating technique... and the fact that because the works are in the public domain, they get richly rewarded. Penguin has increased its print run by 800, 000 copies!  "I said, `800,000 of what?' " Ms. Volokhonsky said in a telephone interview on Friday. The name Oprah Winfrey "was for me totally unknown," she added. "I didn't understand what it could possibly mean. We're glad if we sell 20,000 copies of a book in a year."

      MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZE  So the new owners of the Booker prize have announced another prize, one for international fiction, to be awarded every two years. it's a LOT of money, about $110,000, and guess what? not one penny goes to the translator. in fact, in the company's  urlLink press release  translation is not mentioned at all -- and i quote: "Worth £60,000 to the winner, the prize will be awarded once every two years to a living author who has published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in translation in the English language. " and again, "The Man Booker International Prize is unique in the world of literature in that it can be won by an author of any nationality, providing that his or her work is available in the English language." there's a  urlLink story  about the prize in today's guardian... but once again, no mention of how these works might get into the english language in the first place!

      From the Letters page of the Guardian's Saturday Review:  Translators' trials  (Dec 13, 2003)  Dear Sir,  As a fellow "ambulance driver" I should like to reinforce what Michael Hofmann said about the common perception of literary translation ("Speaking in tongues", November 22). As he correctly argues, the mysterious aura which lingers around translation is a mask for breathtaking ignorance. Furthermore, the literary translator is well aware that any personal input will go largely unnoticed by the reading public. Translation is viewed as a secondary occupation, a halfway house to real creative writing and its practitioners are viewed as little more than obscure solitary craftsman beavering away like those wood beetles which one hears but never sees until they drop out dead on the carpet.

      It's interesting what happens to political biographies in translation. I remember something about Hilary Rodham's having passages deleted and such- specifically, passages that were critical of the Chinese government. But I just came across  urlLink this article  on how Clinton's  My Life  is being received around the world. The most interesting tidbit being:  "The Times of London reported this week that a Mandarin translation of 'My Life' on sale in China included several passages that were not in English-language editions, including statements in which Mr. Clinton tells of his appreciation of Mao Zedong.  The changes start in the first sentence of the book, which in the Chinese version says that the town of Hope, Ark., where Mr. Clinton was born, has 'good feng shui.' "

      Here's a review of the new Italian novel by Giuseppe Genna, translated by Ann Goldstein, in the Guardian-   urlLink In the Name of Ishmael . It's a crime novel- predictably- but is of great historical and stylistic merit.   "In the Name of Ishmael is a sophisticated, cinematic thriller in the manner of Rosi, cross-cutting confidently between two Milan-based investigations 40 years apart, linked to "an occult, tentacular power", a secret religious organisation led by the mysterious, unseen Ishmael. Genna is smart enough to know conspiracies per se aren't interesting because the truth is always disappointing. What counts is the driven nature of the investigator and the accompanying landscape of paranoia, in this case a chilly, inhospitable Europe, in which weather and architecture play as important a part as the crimes"- where "Milan exists on the edge of poetic hallucination."

      INDIA AND ITALY SIGN CULTURAL AGREEMENT.  According to the  urlLink Deepika Global  newsite for "global Indians," Italy and India today signed an agreement to strengthen cultural interchange between the two countries.

Hmmm. Anyone know if the US happens to have signed anything like this of late? Or the UK? Except with each other of course?
