       My first impression was: is it the session voting page the longest page in the world?   I've just got an email message, informing me that  urlLink The Attendee Web site  is up and running. It took me nearly two hours just to prepare an  alpha  version of my schedule. For those of you, who haven't done that so far, I suggest you to do that as soon as possible, since it might be far more time consuming than you think. Yeap, there are zillions of different sessions you can choose from and mostly all of them extremely interesting.  Again, there is one more blog article that I would suggest you to check. It's  urlLink Tim Sneath's article  with a short list of tips for making the most out of the TechEd.  Here's the list of sessions, that I will probably attend at:    Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005 : Exciting New Roadmap To The Future   Visual Studio 2005 & SQL Server 2005 : Come get the details on an exciting new product announcement!   Visual Basic 2005 : RAD Development for the VB Developer   eXtreme Programming: the alternative way to building high quality systems   Visual Basic 2005 : Language Enhancements   SQL Server 2005: .NET Framework-Based Programming in the Database   SQL Server 2005: What's New in Replication   .NET and Diagnostics   Visual C# 2005 : IDE Enhancements for the C# Developer   Visual Basic: Tips and Tricks for Optimizing Your Applications   FrontPage 2003: Designing Customized SharePoint Services and Sites   RAD Data Access with Visual Studio 2005 â€“ the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly   ASP.NET: Best Practices for Performance   .NET Architecture Clinic   Migrating ADO to ADO.NET   SQL Server 2005: Web Services   ASP.NET: Tips and Tricks for Building Server Controls   Windows Forms: Controls Tips and Tricks    I will probably be changing this list thoughout this two weeks before the grand beginning of the TechEd.

       Right now I'm dealing with the following TechEd related dilema: to bring a laptop or not?   I've found an interesting blog post by Bill Evjen who has prepared  urlLink list of things that one should bring to TechEd . I know it's been originaly written for the San Diego TechEd Event, but I guess it doesn't really matter as they're probably all pretty much the same (my guess though).  I've never been to TechEd before, so I was just wondering about the  laptop  thing. I'm not quite yet sure either I will get a laptop (don't have one of my own yet) by that time or not. So I was thinking: will you guys have your own laptops as well or not. And why? Thanks for your comments (if I get any ;)).  Other than that, I do completely suggest anyone who hasn't seen Bill Evjen's list yet, to follow  urlLink this link  and check it out - I found it extremely informative and especially loved his suggestions such as the one related with the business cards and writting messages on the backs of them.

      Yupee. This is my first blog post. I must say that a few months ago I didn't have any idea what blogs are and would probably completely dissagree with anyone saying that I will have one of my own someday. Since the last couple of weeks I have come to the conclusion that it would be worth to try having my own blog where I would discuss things that I love and have passion for.  Therefor I have decided to discuss my work and things that are related to it one way or another. There are definately two subjects that I will be dealing with in the near future...first is  urlLink my own HTML editor  (which is now getting completely rewritten from VB6 code into the VB.NET and C# code) and the second is the  urlLink Microsoft's TechEd event in Amsterdam .  As it goes for the TechEd event, I hope I will be able to share my reflections from the event with the rest of you and give at least some useful information about some of the interesting stuff where I will attend at. And as for the HTML editor goes: most of all, I hope you will be able to give me some useful comments and suggestions throughout the process of developing, which will help me accomplishing the goal of creating a user-friendly and innovative HTML editor using the latest Microsoft's development tools.  I guess I should also tell you a bit more about myself at this point: I am a student in Ljubljana, Slovenia (which is one of the new EU member countries), but usualy spend most of my time developing all sorts of software. One of the major projects, that I have actually started years ago, is  urlLink my own HTML editor  that I have mentioned before and will be the source of many discussions here. Besides that I have one lovely 21 months old daughter with my lovely girlfriend that are together truly the greatest source of joy and fun for me right now! Photos of both of them will be posted somewhere in my blog soon...  Okay...that's it for now...it's 2a.m. here and I guess it's time for me to go to bed. Good night everyone, and read/write you soon!
