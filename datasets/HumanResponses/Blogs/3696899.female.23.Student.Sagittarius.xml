      Well I would have to agree with Mandy on the topic of Michael Moore's new movie.  I think that he is not only saying what everyone else does not want to say but he is also generously funny at the same time.  He makes a point in his movie that when President Bush got news about the first airplane to hit the first tower, that he stayed in the school for about 30-45 minutes before he left.  The President said that he stayed there for so long because he did not want to make the kids feel worried...well guess what they should be!  There was a high risk of a terrorist attack at the University of Maryland the other day when I went to school and I didnt even know it until the next day when it was announced.  Makes me feel really safe to go to my own school.  Well a little bit of an upside, my dad left the hospital yesterday and to my knowledge I dont think that he has had a drink yet.  Well getting to long so I will talk later.  See ya...

      Well how was my day??? I had school all day along with trying to get my dads medical records to take to the attorneys office tomorrow. Phone calls back and forth to the case manager that is working with my dad, and calls back and forth with medical records, along with the lawyers office.  Not to mention all of the calls recieved from my sister today!!  Good Lord help me! Well all of this mess and still feel like nothing is being accomplished.  I am afraid that I am going to have to take power of attorney over his finances and this is a very big deal.  I dont know if I am ready but now I have to be.  If this is the one thing that I do for my father I want to do this right and I will need alot of support and will be getting all of it from my wise and beautiful mother.  Not to mention my second mother Cathy and my best friend Mandy.  You guys I am going to need alot of help.  I hope I am not bald in two weeks. Well that was my day, have the lawyers appointment tomorrow!?!? Letcha know, see ya.

      Fathers Day, oh my god where do I even begin.  Well I spent most of the day in the hospital where my father is at the moment, with a disease that is caused from alcoholism.  This is a terrible thing to happen but he drank from morning till night for as long as I can remember.  I dont remember ever having a father before and nor do I ever think that I will.  He is very sick and we (my sister and I) found out that we are going to have to put him in a nursing home.  He is only 53 years old.  I want to tell everyone to put in your will that if you were to become mentally incompetent make sure that there is someone that you pick to do all of your financial business.  My sister and I feel like pulling all of our hair out because we do not know what to do?!  Well that was my fathers day.  See ya

      Well where do I even begin.  I read the journal of my best friend in the whole wide world and it almost made me cry.  I can not say that we have always been this close, but we even went to elementary school together.  We grew closer as the years grew, I dont know what I would have done without her.  She is the person I go to when I am have trouble, I go to her for everything and she has a way of calming me down with anything.  Mandy has been there for me the whole time my dad has been in and out of the hospital, which he is in again.  She has been my support and a best friend whenever you need her.  And of course she has the two cutiest kids in the whole world, behind Jacob of course, who I hope love me as much as I love them.  I do try and spoil them when I go to see them.  I love you guys so much.  Well one last thing to say and that is get the POPPYCOCK ready Ill be there soon.  Talk to ya later.

      Well well well.  I have decided to go ahead and pamper myself for one last time.  I have decided to get a luxury car.  Yes!!  I dont know when I am going to pick it up, it should be sometime around the 4th.  Dad is doing better I guess, he is out of the hospital and was caught making a drink on last Sunday.  So the stress isnt gone yet.  Mandy I think the exercise will work, just keep at it. Paul when you give me a chance let me know what you website is called. Talk to you later, see ya.
