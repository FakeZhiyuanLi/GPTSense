      My dad wakes me up at 6:00 in the morning today and tell me that somebody left me a present out side. Well its almost my birthday so I was a lil surprise. I walk outside and somebody egged my house. You f ing bastard its not funny. if ne one knows who did  if u told me thad me greeeeat. cuz i dont think the lovely pple driving to work and my neighbors enjoyed scrubbing hard sticky egg off my house in my pjs.  to make the day better we had the power turned off all morning until 2 oo in the after noon. no we didn't forget to pay the electricity bill but these gay workers didn't know what they were doing and turned it off and didn't know what to do   it was from 800 until 200 yeeeeeahhhh it was a blast. No TV, phone , comp, lighing, or treadmil,so I sat there and slept and listened to music and worked out a lil.   oh and things even got shittier. I was sopsed to go to Washington with my friend the lovely Alison and my dad is soo gay and didn't buy a ticket in time so I couldn't go. And it was for a basketball tourn, where there would be 2400 guys there, very enticing for a single girl on the rebound.  but finally things got better. I went to the lovely Anna s house and hung out wit Trisha Luke and my old guy person who I couldn't hang out with for a month rob. It was very fun, we went hotubing and watching Capitan rob. Good good times. Once my brother and his friend picked me up we arrived to freedys because they wanted deli. It was seriously the most fun I have had in Fred Meyer in a while, I guess u had to be there, but believe me it was fun.

      Today was fathers day much love to pops, and it was also anna and mine 2 year anniversery for being friends, I love that girl. Yeah well my brother took me to the range for kicks, and on the way out my dad said looked like i was going to a night club, oooh yes since i was wearing a  tanktop and sweats but honestly i wonder what night clubs he goes to, and i was kind enough not to  mention to him that he looked like he should belong in the group Village People wearing a muscle shirt and cut off jeans.  so once we arive at the golf course i look over at the extremly hot worker, who gives me golf tips from time to time, and god hes like really fine.   the range ends up being packed and one spot left and i let my brother take it   so a spot opened up and i stood up to take it and this asshole just walks infront of me and takes it, whats a f-ing bastard i was really tempted to throw a golf tee at him.    i finnaly got a spot behind the cutest little boy who was more interested in being a bunny and finding a carrot than golfing, finnaly he finishes and dear lord he was replaced with the hottest guy ever... man i love golf! well imbetween tring to shoot good shots and gazing and pure hotness. i notice that my brother is like best friends witih the worker that i adore, and the worker ends up being friends with the hottie in front of me. Small world. hottie worker comes out and has a talk with mystery hottie infront of me and lord it took me soo long to finish that bucket.   as we leave the course i talk to my brother about hotie worker and he ends up being a senior... in colledge  dammit it alll to hell.

      My dad goes out of town then grounds me. For the dumbest reason.. turning down the intercom knob, i must be the only kid in america who has been grounded for that. idk i guess it showed that i was talking about something bad and bad things are apart of me and now i have to be more open with him. yeah i ve been out all weekend lol. so anna i leave during the day so i can walk off the hangover and well anyways we come back home and jeff picks us up and we go crusing, after a couple of hours we come home and my dad called and is really mad cuz he thinks i left. i lied and said i was tanning outside for like 5 hours. he believed me and told me to vacumm the house cuz hes still mad about the whole intercom thing. then i talk to the bitch *Kathriene* and she tells me just out of the blue that my dad asked her to marry her last knight, boy i was so overjoyed.... woo fucking hoo. my dad has still yet to break me the news. how wonderful of him.

Don't leave me hanging  In a city so dead  Held up so high  On such a breakable thread   You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be   You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   You've got your dumb friends  I know what they say   They tell you I'm difficult  But so are they   But they don't know me  Do they even know you?  All the things you hide from me  All the shit that you do   You were all the things I thought I knew  And I thought we could be   It's nice to know that you were there  Thanks for acting like you cared  And making me feel like I was the only one  It's nice to know we had it all  Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done   He was everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending    You were everything, everything that I wanted  We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it  All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away  All this time you were pretending  So much for my happy ending   Avril Laving~My Happy Ending
