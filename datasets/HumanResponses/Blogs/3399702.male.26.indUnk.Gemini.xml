      Ahh, its Sunday and I'm at work. No where else to go. The girlfriend did the breakup thing yesterday. That realy hurts not only because I miss her already but I'm living at her best friends house right now.   She and I and he and his boyfriend were going to have a memorial day bbq tomorrow and then go swimming in his creek. Now I have to figure out what to do withmyself so as not to ruin their holiday.   I've also been burning bridges with friends and friend links so right now I'm not sure what to do when i'm not hanging otu with my girlfriend and her friends. makes for a rough weekend. That's as good a reason as any to be at work, its a shame no work is being done since the system i need to use is down.  Would be nice to get a gmail account right now. Not that It would make these abandonment feelings go away, but it would be something nice in a low point.   What else could go wrong this weekend? The house I'm currently trying to buy has more wrong with it than I thought and its going to cost more than I realized to get it and to fix it. Spending five hundred dollars on the house just to give up and walk away seems like a waste of money. Its goign to happen though, its just a matter of getting nerve up to chat with the realtor and break the news to her and break off that business relationship. sigh, when did life become so difficult. shouldn't it be easier? didn't it used to be easier?

      If I can't get a gmail account maybe I should try to become famous. That would be something wouldn't it? I just got an orkut account, maybe that will help with my gmail search.  Famous, what does it take? Acting ability? Good looks? Good physique? Or just an empty skull and good connections. My name in lights? Travel, and money and fun!  I should have been trying to be famous all my life. I see that guy rance with his famous blog. I think, what does this guy have that I don't besides money and fame.   I'll see if i can keep track of what I'm doing to become famous here. We'll see what happens.  --JoHann out

      Well I read a nice huge article on why us american's are fat. I can't really recall the link since all I've been doing today is surfing the web and reading stuff. Pretty lame way to spend the day at work, I know this.   On to the blog: So people in general are getting fatter because we eat more and have easier time finding food and we are not active enough. I just saw this one guy at work that has to weigh in somewhere close to 400 pounds. He has a restricted parking pass so he can park close to the building, he breaths like a marathon runner when he walks down the halls to the bathroom or to leave.   This guys office is on the second floor, what does he do coming and going? He rides the elevator. Holy shit! How can he do this? If he would stop eating one thing a lunch and walk up and down the stairs, and maybe walk around the building a lunch he might be able to walk to the bathroom without getting winded. He might also lost some weight. What is wrong with people in the world these days?  They get fat, eat more, do less and then get mad and the unattainable beauty in the underwear ads on tv. What the hell? Is it really hard to lose weight? No its not. Eat less and work more. Ya know what? if you are super fat its even easier to lose weight, just eat a little less and walk a little more and in a month you'll be surprised at how much weight you lose. Its absurd really, how people can let themselves go.  I shouldn't rant all that much, I go to work, i surf the web and I leave. It would be really nice to actually do work but that bores me. I'm bored surfing the web too, I suppose thats the same thing with these whales that walk around here, waddling down the hallways.   They are probably unhappy being fat, and unhappy doing anything about it so they just do the same thing they are doing. Its good though, gives me something to write and complain about.

      Been fishing around at http://www.gmailswap.com . I've been posting this and that to see if I can get an invite. I"m wondering if there are actually any gmail invites floating around. I'm beginning to doubt it. There are lots and lots of gmail requests on gmailswap and from perusing the comments I havn't seen any of the threads saying that "I'll give this guy an invite" I'm betting that there are not more invites.  Does anyone know?  At least through deceptive trolling around the gmailswap threads I was able to be an orkut invite. At least the person said they were going to invite me!  I'll keep the world updated on that news. Not that any world is reading this blog. heh heh. I'm reading it though, well or at least reading what I write as I write it.  work work work.

      Well still no news on the gmail invite. Why is this taking so long? Blogger still seems to be a really sweet little web site. Wish I could come up with some more interesting posts though.   been posting stuff at gmail swap also. I'm beginning to wonder if all the current gmail invites have been sent out already and no more exist for now.   anyone out there know if people are still getting invited? I supposed I could surf over to ebay but who's to say that those are valid invites? Other than the seller. Its the sellers job to tell us consumers what we want to hear.   work bites.

      I attempted to mountain bike downhill again at mountain creek in new jersey. I had a new bike with more suspension(cannondale gemini 900) and some knee/shin pads and It was still super hard and very painful.  I'm not sure the downhill biking is for me yet. Its really hard, with a fairly easy chance to get really hurt.  One of the pro's there was riding and he crashed and was all beat up for the rest of the day.  Its a very strange sub culture, these people drive really far to show up and bike, then they put on 2-4 layers of clothes and pads in 95degree heat, and then they proceed to bike down trails that would be nearly impossible to walk down. Then these people make a few runs, then meet under shaded trees to chat, and then they make some more runs.  Later in the day they meet again and sit around and talk about how they crashed here and hurt that and can't ride, or how they crashed there trying to hit new jump A that you should really go check out and see if you can clear and nail correctly.  If that sounds like fun I don't know what crack you are smoking. What does that say about me though, I do intend to give it a few more tries. Once I gain some skillz i think it won't be nearly as bad. Always sucks to be the green rookie!   --still no gmail account

      Ok so that was a hellish uphill ride for the first time.  I don't like walking up hills! I could only clean about half of what we ascended. Now the descent, that was much much more fun, however my hands are hurting from all the bumping and riding over rocks and almost dieing on leaf covered loose rocks.   I'm sure I'll try it again, even though it feels like a truck hit me this morning.

      Anyone seen  http://andykaufmanreturns.blogspot.com ?   I doubt its really him. I mean it doesn't read like what I would expect andy kaufman to read like.   Ok so I'm posting a about bloggers number one blog. I'm sure everyone knows that its there.   No hits or links or googlecrawls yet. I may never get my gmail invite from this blog. Either through bloggspot, which prolly doesn't give offers anymore nor through someone with a gmail account surfing here and saying hey i have an invite let me give it to johann!!

      Neat, I have a blog.  When do i get a gmail invite?  Instead of working hard today I've been researching how to get invited to gmail. I thought about buying an invite, but the username I wanted was gone, so i figured I'd try this bloging stuff out.

      Well, Its official. I have recieved an email invitation to join the elite group of people that have gmail accounts.  Horray! Not really sure what that means for this blog. I'm going to change the name thats for sure, it will definatly mean that I don't have to end posts with "don't have an invite yet."  Such a nice day outside. Its wonderful that Heather over at http://innoparticularorder.blogspot.com/ was kind enough to send me an invite. Go to her blog and thank her for me. Hell I'm going to go post a thank you comment that too.  I was surfing around the web today, wondering if I should update my blog. I really didn't have anything to write about mind you, but then I read the comments and there was one from  Heather and she gave me an invite. Happy days are here, and it even gave me something to write about.   For all you people out there looking for an invite, it can happen!

      My father truely does amaze me. He turned 60 on Saturday. Guess what he was doing? He had torn down the wall in the dining room, and was standing almost on the top rung of a ladder so he could frame in a spot to put in sliding doors.  He torn out the wall by himself and was framing a spot for a new door by himself. He's crazy.  Not that he's 60 and doing this, but that he 60, worked for a whole week besides and is doing this. Did I mention that less than a month ago he had his hip replaced. He's driving around, back to work and it hasn't even been a month. That seems insane to me. Shouldn't he still be on a walker? shoulder he be being more careful?   I hope i'm as strong as he is when I'm his age.  Its possible that I will still not have a gmail invite by then! heh heh.

      I was so ill yesterday! I had a splitting headache, my neck and shoulder are still messed up from the mountain bike crash last week and I could barely keep my dinner down. I didn't want to have to run to the bathroom to throwup and I didn't have a chair to sit upright in so I went outside of the house and sat in a rocking chair.   The weather was cooler outside so that was a plus. sitting up in a chair seemed to help out my upset stomach some, not a lot, but some. Unfortunatly as I was sitting there, feeling sorry and awful about myself, thunder and lightning started to go off in the distance.   Of course it moved closer and closer and then it started to unload its payload of cold water on me. I was so apathetic and miserable that I just sat there. Sitting in the rain, feeling horrible, thinking about all the other times I had been stuck in a thunder storm and It actually made me feel alittle bit better.  There is something to say about the cathartic healing power of a rainstorm I guess.

      So I was sick as hell yesterday and this morning. Super bad headache, no appetite, all kinds of busted up body. When the chiropractor makes a second appointment things are bad. When he uses the electro-stim machine things are bad. When  said machines makes muscles twitch too much on the normal setting, things are bad.   Things are bad. To top it off my job is in danger of either moving to india. That means either I'll get a new position on another team, which is very non-appealing, or a layoff, also very non-appealing. A layoff however means that time is freed up to do other things. Be a beach bum in Hawai'i comes to mind. Fuck the corporate world, screw saving for a future, make the list of 50 things to do in a life and do them. Figure out how to survive at the end of life one way or another, live, experiance and be happy. What's wrong with that?   Its hard to live a life from vacation to vacation.

      The search for gmail is still fruitless. Am I ponce de leon searching for the fountain of youth? No. I am but a bored office drone on a quest to make my "face time" look productive. Lots of network bandwidth down the toilet, lots of mouse clicks, and lots of typing, and there is still no gmail account for me to login to.   Check out http://michaelcastellon.blogspot.com/ if you also are looking for a gmail invite. He's asking for pleas that he will review and then give out a gmail invite to. I suppose its counter productive for me to post that here, where I'm begging for gmail, but hey, if you googled and ended up at this blog, you prolly will end up there, I'll just save you some time.  Driving around in the convertible again. Figure I should change things up a bit since the girlfriend dumped me. It is fun, to have the top down and know there are all kinds of ponies under the hood, but it doesnt' do much for that empty feeling, its just a bit of a diversion I guess.

      http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,63677,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4  Ok thats an ungly link, how about this: http://tinyurl.com/2tn8l  http://www.tinyurl.com is a very usefull site.  On to the blog.  Sothat wired article is talking about cloning, the new UN treaty that is trying to ban cloning and how countries may or may not be for or against the treaty. How certain countries laws would be in violation of the treaty and all of that disagreement.  Reproductive cloning, somatic(theraputic) cloning. I don't care. I think we should look at this like we looked at the whole nuclear bomb kind of way. There are lots of moral questions, but they should be cast aside, because some countries are going to go against the treaty and develop technologies that are great for themselves and even possibly for war. If we pass laws that limit our reseach on cloning we could cause serious problems for ourselves down the road.  Ignoring technology for some "moral" undefined reason is a bad idea. Bite the bullet, and go for it, who knows what will happen down the line to make it justified? Didn't da vinchi have issues with his culture when he was digging up bodies and disecting them.

      There's nothing quite like injuring a bodypart during a sport. Its a wonderful feelign to launch over a 4' drop on a mountain bike only to realize mid air, or almost mid air that the front of the bike is going to drop before the rear tire leaves the launching zone. That's a very very scary feeling. Then finding oneself in a heap on the ground, bike tossed oneway, helmet smashed up, bodyparts hurting and shaking. Its not the best feeling.  The best part though, the part that is the crowning achievement is waking up the next day to realize that one's shoulder, and other bodyparts are in more pain than the day before.  Wonderful end to a great weekend. Lose a house, lose a girlfriend, crash on the bike, continue to be homeless. I can't ask for much more.  life's sweet.

      The road less traveled sometimes has little bonuses. Driving on the same road day in and day out, one would think that one would know everything about the road. Where the bumps are, where the turns are, what the scenery is like, lots of little tid bits about the road.  Ok, now ride a bike along the road. It changes things, changes perspectives, now hills that didn't seem to be noticed stand out in full force, now temperature changes from chade and from a river hugging the road are abundently more apparent. Now look down, you might see writing on the shoulder of the road.   While riding on part of the Ironman http://www.ironmanusa.com course up in Lake Placid on Saturday, I noticed these things. On the shoulder each hill was named. It brings a smile out when one is riding along, trying to get up a hill and finds out that the brutal hill is called bear papa, and that the hills conquered before it were bear baby and bear mama.  The cherry little and cherry big hills were even nice to learn about. Biking is important for people to do. Biking lets a person enjoy life at a slower pace, but at the same time it makes life more exciting, and really gives a feeling of being outside.   To ride a bike on a road and get somewhere is such a great feeling. Ride a bike to work one day and a wonderful feeling of accomlishment and vigor happens. Unless the ride to work is excessivly long and prohibative.   Plus the fuel is cheap, my bike gets 1 burrito for 20 miles. roundtrip to work is 1.2 burritos.  Cheaper than my car.

      Finish school, go to college, finish college, get a job, or go to more college and more college. These are goals in life. These are the easy goals that make sense and are simple decisions. They put of life decisions don't they?  Being an angst filled youth, or pseudo youth who can't make decisions is tough. Working to pay bills to work to fill time. Thats not the best way to drift through life. Work isn't the end all be all of existance, for me at least it isn't.   Work is something that takes up time that could be better spent doing other things, any other things, just as long as they are not work and they are for me and my happiness. There are people that love their jobs, that love going to work, then there are people like me that don't quite love their jobs, or rushing to go to work to answer that email about that project that really doesn't matter in the scheme of things.  To defeat and derail depression in these situations, one needs goals. Let me write one down right now. One that will yield experiances that will in turn yield bloggs.   I'm going to gain 13lbs and compete in a body building contest next october. There, its a goal, its written down and it can be measure and kept track of. That wasn't so hard was it?   The traine that is giving advice and roadside assistance on the way to this goal crippled my legs this morning. It was definatly fun. Its educational how many different ways there are to build muscle, and how some of those ways really really hurt.  good times.

      Its amazing, under a week with a new fancy gmail account, and they are already giving invites out. Six invites! It really puts things into perspective; it took me ages it seems to get an invite and now the account that I opened has 6 to give out. Three are already given out, but there are three more that are still ready to be given out.  This brings to mind the idea of gmail hoarders, people that just chase after invites. Then there are the people that open up all the accounts themselves with the invites, it makes a person think that maybe google is doing this not only to be the coolest freemail service, but to also run a social experiment and see how people try to get a gmail account. How people try to get invites and what happens.   Who knows whats going on behind the scenes?  Next up on Johann's corner: rant on grilling. Tune in same bat time same bat channel.

      http://www.xeron.org/cosas/bowman/  That game is impossible. Not totally impossible but partially. If one has the setting to add wind, there are certain situation where one will not be able to hit the opposing archer, ever, at all.  Its rather frustrating to have the wind blow the death blow away from the opponent. Very very Dreadfully hateful.  The game is so very simple with wind off though. Sometimes its possible to win with wind on but other times the computer clearly uses its magic to blow away all of the arrows. Unfair it is, unfair.

      http://www.asphaltplayground.com/  There it is. The asphalt playground. It was only a matter of time before this snowboarder, carving on a race board stepped onto a long carving skateboard and decided that its a good thing to play with in the summmer.  How many hobbies can a person have? Snowboarding, both on soft and hard plates, sky diving, mountain biking, road biking, bike trials, kite surfing, wind surfing, and now skayboarding.  Its a good thing tall people have trouble with white water kyaks. I think I would end up doing that next. Sheesh.  There are lots of fun things to do in the world and there isn't enough time and money to do them. Hell wouldn't it be nice to pick up sailing. Theres another fun sport. There is guy I know that is living on his new 26' odey sailboat for the summer. He takes it out on the water, he brings it in, he sleeps on it, he travels around the state on it.  Fun Fun stuff.  Ahh life is good isn't it?

      Begforgmail.blogspot.com was my first blog. I was using that to beg for a gmail account, and it finally paid off. The nice Heather over at http://innoparticularorder.blogspot.com/ was kind enough to set me up with a gmail account.   Gmail rules by the way, if you didn't already know that.   Since I thought it was funny to have a url that was begforgmail.blogspot.com I figured That I would change the url and then start a new blog and just link the old blog to here if anyone was caring.   That's what this is, a new blog just for a new url cause that's what I want.   1) If anyone happens to have the mp3 of zwan doing the Iron Maiden cover "Number of the Beast" I would love to have it emailed to me. That would rule.  2) If you have never checked out http://caliblog.com check it out. The movies are cool and the blog itself is interesting. It may actually inspire me to do something similar.  3) Anyone figured out the meaning of life beyond the number 42? I'd be happy to hear what it is.

      Blogger for me is a journal where the pronoun "I" is left out as much as possible. It follows, then that when times are good, that there is less to talk about. When times are emotional or when anger is flairing, that more writing seems to happen. Is it like that for other people blogging out there? Or do they seem to keep things rolling along irrespective of personal states of mind?    Not even that its good times that prevents writing, its more like when times are ok, that personal introspection drops off and then things slow down. Instead of having bad days and looking to the future and coming up with plans that change things, its easier to just float along.    Work is work, fun times are fun times, and not thinking about marriage, or moving, or working somewhere else and moving, these are the things that my mind should be working on. Avoiding writing in a journal, even one where the "I" pronoun is mostly absent, seems to keep things on a more even keel.     Maybe then blogging is good for people. Its a way for people to keep thoughts more organized, its a way for goals to slip up and get written down, its a free way to have personal therepy without having professional opinions on it. Sure people can comment on posts and say "Your a 'git touch off", but what does that really mean, and who really cares what a poster says? Random people posting random things on a blog are fun to read but they don't have to be taken to heart. Its really just a stranger saying something.     Writing in a blog is fun, reading the comments are fun, sifting through a locked mind looking for intersting things to write about while avoiding moving forward in life and creating any kinds of goals is scary.

      There once was a World Gym in Poughkeepsie. People went there to work out, people went there to lose weight, people went there to take yoga and spinning classes and to better their bodies.   World Gym is now changing to Planet Fitness. The big scary weights are going away, the child care is going away, the group classes are going away, and they are spending $500,000 for you, their members to make the place better.  What was wrong with the gym in the first place? People working out and losing weight and gaining muscle? Oh no, they don't want that. They want to maximize profit, cause that's what an owner has to do right?   No, its not good to have a $45 monthly membership and actually have members show up, its better to have a $20 membership where members don't like the gym, can't find time to drop the kids off and end up leaving the gym after awhile.  Who is going to use this new gym where lots of the free weights are gone and the dumbellls don't go up past 80 lbs? No one uses the heavy weights anyways right?  To make money a gym needs to recycle lots of members, charging $20 a month will certainly entice people to join that wouldn't in the first place. Then those people might stay for awhile because working out with "no judgements" will make them feel comfortable.   Will they really be more healthy though? No one there to make them feel uncomfortable about how fat they are, how crummy they look compared to the ripped body builder next to them, no one telling them "Hey I work hard and this is what the pay off is"   No they will get someone there to chat with though, and they will get all kinds of different people out of shape to make them feel like they are not as out of shape as that other person so they don't have to work as hard.   Its sad really, for a gym to want members for money and not want to open a gym to own a gym. A place where people work out and try to get better and healthy and ready  for life. They want to open a place where they make money and get the lowest common denominater to earn it.  I need a new gym.
