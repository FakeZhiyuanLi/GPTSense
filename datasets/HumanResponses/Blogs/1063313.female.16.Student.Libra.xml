But then on our way out rodgers got lost... u would think a 10th grader could remember where we parked............. but he was on the other side of the building and was compleatly lost...... we were gonna call him but nobody knew his cell # so we got 2 groups of peeps out lookin for him an we finally found him... i was thinkin he got mugged or somethin cool but he was just lost :-( well i gotta go... cause i can smell spaghettii... and its like one of my favorite foods an knowin my family they will start eatin w/o me and that would really suck cause if i dont get in there fast i wont get 3rds or 4ths... so luv ya'll an ttyl

      it's amazing how a beautiful talented girl thinks she needs to change just for the people around her, I wish guys wouldn't take advantage of girls like that, no one deserves to be treated that way, especially someone like that. God help me if she doesn't come to her senses and stop listening to stupid pricks

      ooooooooomg. yall HAVE to hear this. my mom LITERALLY spazzed. i swear. okay i get in the car and she's like screaming "GET IN" and i get in close the door and she puts all the windows up and then starts LITERALLY SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS about why i'm not goin to the football game tonight w/ mrs. r. b/c i shouldnt be askin he for ANYTHING b/c she's takin it personally about what's happenin between me and anna and that mrs. r. is being mean to my mom b/c of what's happenin between me and anna (lol, take a breath if you must this'll be a lil long then english peeps would like) and that what's goin on between me and anna should stay between the 2 of us and not be between the 4 of us b/c it's between me and anna. Soo, i was like "well me and anna are---(i get cut off..)" and she GOES ON AND ON. and THEN she makes me repeat basically everything she said b/c she thought i was just sittin there sayin "yes yes yes okay" a million times and THEN she told me that i should NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN ask ANY of the reibers for ANYTHING and if i want ANYTHING she's gonna take me to the games and w/e. so THEN i have to go BACK inside and tell mrs. r. that i cant go and mrs. r. was like "wha-- i told ur mom in the office that you asked if i could take you and she kinda looked suprised (and pissed, lol i'm addin that i just cant put in words what she did. lol)" and then i told her that it was b/c (she asked why) b/c my mom thinks that "your" takin personally what's happenin between me and anna (i left out that my mom said mrs. r. was bein mean to her) and that i shouldnt be askin and w/e.. and so then i walk back to my car (and julie sticks her toungue out at me so i had to do that back, and i think my mom got worse after that lol) and so i get in the car and my mom CONTINUES until mrs. r. comes out there (tho, when i was talkin to mrs. r. i told her not to say what i said to her b4 i left her) so mrs. r. comes out there and is like nice and kinda and sweet to my mom and was like "it's okay we can still take her, i mean ashley doesnt ask me for anything as much or invites herself as much w/ me as much as anna did to yall" and my mom's like"no no, she needs to learn not ask that kinda crap (what the-- i mean, the r.'s are like my other family, since WHEN did my mom start sayin THAT crap?!?!?!) so mrs. r. was like "well if you change ur mind..." and my mom was like "well we'll just do this another time" and mrs. r "this is the last game" my mom "we'll do this another time" (i swear they both said the same thing 5 times in 5 diff ways) so then mrs. r. leaved and i expect my mom to start screamin again. she was freakin me out. and she was also drivin like a WILD women. honestly. gezz i wish i got to go to that game.. uhhh i really hate my mom.. and also, my mom when she was screaming i know the people outside the car and around it were prolly listenin. and her voice was crackin she was screamin so loud. now i have to go tell my dad, cause that's really freaky. and i REALLY want to go to the game. this is the last time. but in my mom's words "she'll do this again" WHEN exactly will i be able to do this again? seeing as how this is the LAST FRIGGIN GAME?!?! gezz i really hate my mom right now. and i swear if anybody posts about how i should be wrong in the situation i will literally lay down and die. either that or jump THRU the comp and come after you with a VERY sharp...um.. pencil. yes. lol, okay toodles~~

      i'm sooooo sorry for you ashley. and you must be pretty mad to use pissed that many times in one blog, but it's not the end of the world, peeps will forget about this in a day or two, no biggie, just don't let em know it bothers you.  I think some of em can smell fear.

      okay here's the story.

a couple weeks ago me and emily were talkin about HER crush. she i brought up out i thought chunky was cute. and therefore since emily's dude is chunky, and Chunky is not really chunky but all the same really tall, we call him Chunky. (sooo many chunkys in that sentence..)

soooo only me and emily knew who chunky was (not hers. mine. and i dont mean mine, i meant..oh crap nm keep up!!) so finally i tell danielle. and low and behold ms. bigmouth had to tell sidney. oh-my-gosh. why did she tell him? b/c she was getting attention and for her pitiful self any attention is good enough for her. SOOOOO then sidney tells history class. but not only does sidney tell who chunky is, he also tells who cheerios is. which doesnt really matter to me as much as chunky (cheerios is kenny) cause chunky's feelins would be hurt cause "chunky" is meaner then "cheerios" and btw, the "cerial list" or w/e was like in 7th grade people! okay so yeah, sidney tells the history class when i'm out of the room in the batheroom. so when i walk back in brett's like "oh it's zach shires" blah blah blah and all this crap. and then sidney's tryin to give me his phone # and i was like "i dont want to know his phone #" and sidney's says "it's.." and i'm like "well oviously i dont care that much if i dont want to know" and ended the convo. in history. except for this small detail that totally pisses me off: mrs. cruse didnt EVEN TRY OR ATTEMPT to shut sidney up. and that realllllllllllllllly pisses me off.
so off to lunch i have to put up with sidney shoutin it ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL across the cafeteria.. and then sidney has to KEEP UP with it. at first emily was like "keep strong, it'll be okay, if i were you i'd be cryin ect. ect. ect." and then later when her mom drove me home i was like "uh i just wanna kill sidney" and emily went from being nice about it to "well then you'll go to jail" honestly i dont like talkin to her when i'm pissed.

THEN sidney tells me that he's gonna tell zach he's chunky at football practice. except i dont care if sidney tells the whole school it's just that zach wont get the whole "chunky" thing and take it personally. lol at lunch i was like "he can tell the whole world--just not zach" lol. ericka said i was "pretty pathetic" lol

so earlier i was really pissed cause i knew sidney was gonna tell zach that i liked him. but now it's not that. it's the fact that EVERYBODY KNOWS and then zach's gonna find out i've been callin him "chunky" for like.. 2 weeks cause of an inside joke that he wont get, and he'll take the whole "chunky" thing seriously.. bahhhh oh yeah. ANNND i told anna who chunky was b4 everyone knew and she was like "he's a  baad  boy" and i was like "i know" lol and we laughed about that. except the laughin stopped when sidney TOLD EVERYBODY. gag. i hope i never meet sidney in a dark alley... and then there's emily "you'll go to jail" honestly.. the good part of the day was.. morning.. and nobody said anything in chemistry.. and i didnt have to go to art.. tomorrow is going to  suck  reallllllllllly bad. okay i'm leaving i'm tired of talking about my feelings...gah.

      I’m finally doing this cause I got the whole story now and sam won’t leave me alone until I do.  This is a blog about the short time I went out with Breanne.  I am going to try to tell this as fairly as possible and I will include the exact emails from the last few days of the whole thing.  Last year bre had started to flirt with me and I didn’t want to do anything cause I didn’t know her and she was a 7th grader.  This year she still seemed interested so I was going to ask her out when I got a car.  My friends convinced me to ask her to the dance and I did.  When I couldn’t take her she gave me her number and long story short we started going out.  She really seemed to like me at this point and I still think she did for the first few weeks.  We talked on the phone bout every day.  IF I didn’t call her she would call me.  I went on the trip to Louisville, the pep bus, so I could spend some time with bre.  She sat behind me on the bus and held me on the way up there and I held her on the way to Starkville and most of the way back home.  I won’t go into anymore detail than that though.  It was pretty mushy.  We still talked on the phone, but to me it kinda seemed like she started to fade away.  She insisted she still liked me and still talked to me bout every day.  About a week later I found out she had been telling people she was thinking about dumping me and if she was gonna do it, she would do it the next Monday.  This was Friday.  I called her that night to talk about it and she said that she wasn’t sure she wanted a boyfriend now and that she would make up her mind depending on how Saturday went.  I was going to a horse show with her Saturday.  Saturday went pretty good and I met one of her best friends.  Sunday night she told me that she didn’t want a boyfriend anymore and that she still liked me.  She said that everything would be pretty much the same, but that she didn’t want to be labled.  She said that she just didn’t want to have a boyfriend now.  This is what she told everybody.  This seemed weird, but I still got the girl and I was fine with it cause I wanted to do what made her happy. She insisted that she still liked me and that she wasn’t just telling me a story.  That next day I was told by Tim that I had been played and that she had been planning to dump me for weeks.  I did not believe him.  I’ll clear that up now.  Ian, of course, went to Breanne and told her this.  She took it like I did believe tim and this is when the whole mess started to snowball.  She got mad.  I was going to decide for myself what had happened when I saw her 5th period and how she acted.  She ignored me 5th period cause she was mad at me and I then thought I was played.  I got depressed of course and tried to call her.  The first time I called she claimed she was talking to matt hall.  I now know she was talking to Erin and Erin told her she would give her 5 dollars if Breanne told me she was talking to matt hall.  She told me she would call back.  I called back in an hour cause I hadn’t heard from her.  Her sister answered and said she was busy studying.  This is when I decided to give up.  The last thing I was gonna do was to buy her a purple hair clip.  I told her Saturday that I would get her a clip when I got Katie one.  I owed Katie one cause I accidentally broke hers.  Purple is her favorite color.  I woulda felt like I lied if I hadn’t done it.  I put a note in there with the clip that said I woulda like to have been friends but I guessed she was too mad for that.  I got an email from her asking if we were still friends. I replied and said I did want to be friends, but I didn’t care about going out anymore.  She replied back that she wanted to be friends, really good friends.  I called her later and asked her to get on the internet.  She got on and I talked to her for about an hour.  Later that night she called and we talked for about an hour then too.  She said she was depressed and that usually she would have gotten over a guy by now.  She would not tell me either way if I ever had a chance with her again or not.  I still liked her then and she acted like she hadn’t gotten over me so I thought I had a chance.  The next day at school she treated me the same she had been all week long.  I was ignored by her or she was at least too depressed to talk to me or really even look me in the face.  Her friends are even making fun of me by now too.  Here are the last few emails we sent each other.   Most of these are from last night.

Breanne: hey josh i have been lieing to you , im really sorry.  i dont still like you like that.  i use to like you alot but i didnt like some of the things you did.  i didnt play u.  i should have told you this from the beggining, but i was affraid you would hate my and be mad at me for ever.

Me: hey thanks for telling me bre, i don't hate you, and i couldn't hate you.  I figured this much anyways, but when you don't have the courage to tell someone this on the phone, its pretty sad. I would just like for you to at least talk to me. An email won't do, i've got to hear this from you whether it be in person or on the phone. I get the feeling that you would rather do it on the 
phone.  Please call me when you get this.

Breanne: i cant tell u to ur face b/c it hurts me to tell you.  and i cant tell you on the phone ethier.  well i like somebody i dont think u care but i was ganna let u know that i like matt c. and we have been talkin on the phone lately i was ganna let you know

Me: I know you don't care ,but it hurts worse when the girl that was crazy bout you just a few weeks ago can't even look you in the face anymore.  I don't know how i can respect somebody who can't even fess up on the phone. I'm sorry it ended up like this. I'll leave you alone from now on; you won't have to worry about that anymore.  Goodbye Breanne

Breanne: hey u make my life right now a living hell right now im having the worst day if u only knew wait a min you dont really care so i guess i well never talk to you again and yes that is a promise

Me: the message wasn't meant to hurt you. it just the truth.  I sorry bre

This is the when she stopped talking to me and she started fussing to sam about me.  She was pretty mad and that was not what I wanted to do.  I just told her the truth.  I sent her this last email, and I hope she reads it.  She hasn’t yet.

Me: well, bre i guess you hate me now. you just got off the internet and you will probably never talk to me again. I'm sorry i have made your life a living hell; that was never my intention, i just wanted to figure out what had gone wrong.  I loved you and wanted to know what i could have done to lose you.  I won't bother you any more, and i won't talk to you at school.  You seem to have made it clear you don't want me to do that.
Once again i am really sorry it ended up like this, and goodbye breanne

             P.S. good luck with Cranfield, i wish you best

That was the last thing I sent her I’m not going to do anything else. It’s over and she hates me.  I wasn’t mad at her then and I am still not mad at her.  I;m pretty disappointed that it all turned out like this. I wish it hadn’t been this bad, but the truth is, I think it might have worth it to have been able to to go out with such a pretty girl, if only for a little while.  She is going out with Cranfield which is kind of ironic cause the whole reason she gave me for breaking up was she didn’t want a boyfriend now.

      Well... I am going to put the story of me getting lost on here... so i guess here goes...

Ok so I was going to danelle's movie night thingamajig or whatever and i had to get to her house so i called her up and she gave me directions, they went like this "go to the sack and save parking lot and head like you are going to ashleigh's old house" so i am thinkin, ok easy so far, then she says "turn right and when you come to a 3-way stop go left then you see my little hill thingy with my house" and i am like sure well anyways i come out of the sackansave parking lot an turn left like i am going towards ashleigh's house, i follow her directions and dont get anywhere near her house, i drove around lots of little houses all back around in that area for about 30 mins... anyways somehow after taking one of the little roads back there i end up on halls ferry near rebel archery, so i go an use thier pay phone to call my dad an see if he can help me (cause i left my directions at the house an i was driving from memory) anyway he sends me over down porters chapel road an off on like wisconson or whatever anyway i get back to looking through little houses... after i have been driving around for 50 minutes i am fixin to head home and i see this weird truck behind me flashing its lights and swerving into the middle of the road an stuff i am thinkin ok, eiether this is a crazy driver with no brakes or some dude with a gun who is fixin to kill me, anyways this truck passes me an josh&julie are like hangin out the window so i stop an turn around an wait for them to lead me back to danelles house, she told me to go in the compleate opposite direction... ahh well it was all ok in the end, only got delayed 52 minutes

      hmmmm, the no fish story, actually its not that long. a few years ago this alge stuff started grownin on top of our pond. not a good thing, eventually this crap has spread over the entire surface of the pond.  this cuts off sun and oxygen to the fish and plants inside. so they all died and floated up to the surface.  There startin to come back cause this stuff all died off after a few years, i dunno why, but there's not enough to fish. there is alot of snakes though. and mom wouldn't appreaciate me harassing all the poor little squirrls. don't have the money for a paintball gun either, well i'll ttyl and ttfn, Cheers!

       hey all....its been like 3 or 4 months since we've actually published anything...we thought bout just deleting it...but im bored so i decided not to...and since ashlee is movin back to georgia this is my idea for us to stay in touch...lol anyways me and brett broke up...for those who dont know brett bufkin yes i said his last name and i dont care who reads it...cause he's officially a HUGE pot head and im not jokin u can ask marybeth and if im lien let someone shoot me right now....and he's nuttin but a alchoholic who cant control his own temper and he beats girls...im serious, and he's mean to everyone and he freakin lies bout everything he told someone the reason we broke up was cause i told my mom that....well nevermind it has to do with him smokin pott...and now on to new business i like this new dude mark...he's got white blonde hair thats long in the front and it curls outward...he's so cute i think he's goin to be a senior this year he's a sweetheart but the problem is&nbsp;that i dont know if he's playin me or not i mean in my heart i know he's not but after the way brett treated me i dont know if i could handle that again. cause i lost 15 pounds and those of yall that know me i only weighed 89 lbs to start with ...so now im like 75 and im slowly gaining weight. but o well anyways just so u know  NOOOO  im not balemic(cant spell to save my life) and im not anorexic...but still..im bored if u cant tell so im just writin to keep me entertained...anyways back to mark...lol we were talkin tonight and like this gurl said that he played her cousin and her friend....which he didnt do but in a sense he did without intentions but o well who among us hasnt made a mistake before...lol just for the record im not a mean and hatefull person usually but when someone hurts me as bad as brett did and as many times as he did...im gonna get payback lol and i hope he burns in H...E...double hockey sticks...id say hell but i cant bring myself to say it...lol, school starts in like 3 or 4 weeks and im a JUNIOR YAY...and like new pple are comin left and right and i dont know half of them..lol and we have the city pep rally...yay&nbsp; i made cheerleadin but anyways....if anyone reads this...what should i do bout the dude named mark...i mean i know he likes me cause we've established that but i dont know if he's waitin to ask me out until he knows me better or if its all a game to him...and also if any1 knows any good ways to get payback on   pott smokin alchoholic beating two timing&nbsp;sons on bitches&nbsp;for EX'S let me know
