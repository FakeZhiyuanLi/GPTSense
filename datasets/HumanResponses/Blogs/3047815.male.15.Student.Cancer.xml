      There really aren't many frontiers left for my generation. The land, air, and sea have been conquered. Orbit, the moon, outside the solar system. It has all been done. The only thing that has not been done is a crewed landing on Mars. In 1893, a gentleman by the name of Frederick Jackson Turner delivered a speech at the annual conference of the American Historical Society. This little known professor from the University of Wisconsin characterized America, not through religion or politics, but the existence of the frontier:   ...to the frontier the American intellect owes its striking characteristics. That coarseness of strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find the expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends that restless, nervous energy, that dominant individualism, working for good and evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance that comes from freedom-these are the traits of the frontier, or traits called out elsewhere because of the existence of the frontier. Since the days when the fleets of Columbus sailed into the waters of the New World, America has been another name for opportunity, and the people of the United States have taken their tone from the incessant expansion which has not only been open but has even been forced upon them. He would be a rash prophet who should assert that the expansive character of American life has now entirely ceased. Movement has been its dominant fact, and, unless this training has no effect upon a people, the American energy will continually demand a wider field for its exercise. But never again will such gifts of free lands offer themselves. For a moment, at the frontier, the bonds of custom are broken and unrestraint is triumphant. There is not tabula rasa. The stubborn American environment is there with its imperious summons to accept its conditions; the inherited ways of doing things are also there; and yet, in spite of the environment, and in spite of custom, each frontier did indeed furnish a new opportunity, a gate of escape from the bondage of the past; and freshness, and confidence, and scorn of older society, impatience of its restraints and its ideas, and indifference to its lessons, have accompanied the frontier. What the Mediterranean Sea was to the Greeks, breaking the bonds of custom, offering new experiences, calling out new institutions and activities, that, and more, the ever retreating frontier has been to the United States directly, and to the nations of Europe more remotely. And now, four centuries from the discovery of America, at the end of a hundred years of life under the Constitution, the frontier has gone, and with its going has closed the first period of American history.  That first period of American history is now long past closed, and so is the second period, mainly the Space Age. The next great frontier for human endeavor is Mars. Right now, society is stagnating. Music, art, science, everything. Things are beginning to repeat themselves. What we need is a new frontier, a new chapter in life. Mars can provide this frontier. The Red Planet is the perfect candidate for a frontier. It is the only place in our solar system that we know of that can support a civilization. The colonization, or even manned exploration of Mars will yield immeasurable riches, not only in terms of economic growth.Economically, Mars is not a problem. Technologically, Mars is not a problem. Politically, Mars is a problem. The budget of NASA, over a span of one decade, is enough to support a crewed Mars mission. The technology exists now to launch humans to the Red Planet. But, the political climate is one that does not want scientific advancement, or a new scientific adventure. Today, politics wants conquest; politics wants military adventures that could secure a steady stream of oil; politics wants money; politics wants security. But what politics does not want is science. Science is heavily under-funded today. Government scientific institutions, such as NASA, are slowly bleeding to death. NASA's current budget is $6 billion, which hampers NASA's true potential. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the end of the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, NASA lost a lot of support in Congress as well as the White House. NASA's budget started to drop, and now it is at a low. But this low budget, with the reallocation of funding by the Bush space proposal, is more than enough to reach the Red Planet. Research done during the Space Age on nuclear rocket engines, and life support processes for long duration space flight can be adapted for use on a crewed Mars mission. If this technology is revived, then costs can be cut even further. Nevertheless, the end of the Bush presidency (hopefully) will bring about a definite change in political climate, with relations with other nations being smoothed out, and economic stability. Mars may soon be within reach. Mars provides the challenge that humankind needs to further its evolution and rescue it from a period of intellectual stagnation. Mars is our New World to explore, and colonize.

      Conquest. It has dominated, it has scarred human history since the first appearance of us humans, almost six million years ago. Rome, Carthage, Greece, Sparta, Troy. Human history is full of succesful and failed conquests, but what effect has conquest had on society? Obviously one that is detrimental to development. Conquest, in terms of war, has ruined the world, and is accelerating the coming of the inevitable apocalypse. Take the example of England during the 19th and 20th centuries. The British Empire spanned from the Americas in the west to India and China in the east. Great Britain was truly great. In India, the British established harbors and proceeded to "acquire" the source of the spice they wanted so badly. They forced people to work for them, and pay taxes, while they grew fat off the spices and their steady flow of income and the people of India starved to death. In Sri Lanka, the British united two kingdoms into one they called Ceylon. In Africa, the British wanted the diamonds and the infinite riches. They forced African people to harvest diamonds. On average, ten African slave workers died to harvest one shiny rock. A shiny rock that the British nobility would wear, while they claimed they valued human life more than anything else. When the British granted independence to India, and Sri Lanka in 1948, they started a conflict that would rage on for half a century, still with no end in sight. In India, the exit of the British governemnt led to religious strife between the Hindus and the Muslims. After some violence, the Muslims moved to western India and created the state of Pakistan. The conflict between these two nations is still going on today in the Kashmir region. In Sri Lanka, the British gave power to the Sinhalese, one of the two groups they united, and hastily left. Now, the Tamils, who have been suppressed by the Sinhalese, want their own homeland. They have formed an organized military and are rising up agains the Sinhalese regime. In Africa, the nations once controlled by Western powers are in shambles. Today, once again, the Western World is hungry for conquest. The Korean Peninsula, Israel and Palestine, Vietnam, and the nations of the former Soviet Bloc have all felt the downside to "help" from the Western World. These nations, as well as those once controlled by Britain have an almost nonexistent economy, and thus are struggling for their survival. President George Bush conquered Afghanistan in the name of the Twin Towers of New York, and failed to conquer Iraq. The people of Afghanistan, as well as the people of Iraq now know that the Western World is not better than their tyrranical leaders. The people of the Western World know this too, but they do not want to accept it, because they want to be patriotic, or rather chauvinistic; because they want to be faithful to their country. The whole world knows that the apocalypse brought on by the Western powers is nearer, now moreso than ever. These wars, in the name of revenge and clashing ideals, are not necessary for the survival of humankind. While they may be a useful method for population control, they vastly suppress intellectualism. They inspire supsicion among people that were once the best of friends. War is detrimental to society, as well as the human mind. Conquest, in terms of war, is not necessary. Maybe one day, we foolish humans will realize that war, and conquest degrade our existence? Nevertheless, I doubt that this day may not come soon enough.
