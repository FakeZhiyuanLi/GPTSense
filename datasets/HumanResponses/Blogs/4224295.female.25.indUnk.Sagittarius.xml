      I am so booooooored!!!!!!!  Ugh! I'm gonna tell you a story....  It's the story of Graham! Graham is this guy that I met months and months ago. Now, we both expressed and interest in one another and there was obvious flirting... He asked for my number... suggested we get together sometime... and than never called. Now, anytime we ran into eachother after that it was always the same. He wants us to go out sometime, keeps saying he's gonna call, etc. So, I don't seem him for like a month and a half... BAM! There he is again. He's still interested in me, etc... I however am losing my patience!! I mean, if he's just looking for a piece of ass... fuck, try takin' a girl out for a couple of drinks or something!! Like, I'd like to get laid too!! I just need a little persuasion! Put some effort into it! Needless to say I haven't seen him again in a couple weeks... So what the hell do I do when I see him again??? Smack him around a bit and say "Hey! I'm willing to put out!!"... Or do I give up and ignore him??? I'm at a loss!!! How do you make yourself "available" without looking like a whore??  hmm

      So I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life! *L*... I'm sitting there in Chan's apartment lastnight, by myself, with her spazzy cat freakin out all over the place... there's no internet hooked-up, no cable, and it's not that great of a neighborhood... so needless to say I was really paranoid with every noise I heard. Being the good friend that I am I agreed to house-sit for a week while she and her boyfriend went to the cottage.. in the middle of nowhere! So.. I looked at the movies available to me and picked "Love Actually". Now, if you've never seen this movie, don't watch it if- A: you're alone, B: if you're a little depressed, C: if you're in love, or D: if you've just broken up with someone! *L*.. Mainly reason A:! I bawled through the whole thing! The whole movie is a roller coaster of emotion... so make sure your hands and feet are on the couch at all times!! By far though... the best movie I"ve seen in a long time!!!!!! That's all for now... I've got to get back to my solitary.. and the damn cat!

          I sit in utter darkness a cigarette smouldering in one hand some thoughts in the other I wonder if I'll ever meet the man of my dreams or if I will truly be happy one day I relish in my friends and the love of my family I think about my days ahead and wonder if I'll make it and then I crush out my cigarette and put my thoughts back in my pocket

      So I'm hanging out at Nancy's right now... CHillin' with the Peachy & the Freaky...  It's so nice to be able to smoke while I'm on a computer.. Don't have that luxury at home.  Home to me is at Mommy and Daddy's... with brother.. his girlfriend.. and their daughter! Needless to say, it's a little cramped in there. I can't even spend time on the computer without getting bitched at all the time... This should be resolved soon tho as I am putting another computer in my room. Gonna web cam it and everything... It will be nice! Anyways, nothing much really to say... Gonna go!

      "I wanna live, I wanna leave, I wanna open up and breathe I wanna go, I wanna be, I wanna feel it constantly gotta show, gotta say, I've gotta feeling that won't go away I've gotta know if they got away, my opportunities... Just one chance is all I ever wanted just one time I'd like to win the game from now on I'll take the chance if I can have it just one just one. I need to think, I need to feed, I need to see if Istill bleed. I need a place, I need a time, cause I need to step outside that line, gonna give, gonna take, gonna scream 'til I'm awake, I'm gonna push, I'm gonna pull, open up the door..... and if I knew when the door was open I'd go, I would go on through and I can say, when I do I'll never be the same, never be the same........"     - Hoobstank

        So...                I sit here and wonder what would be the   "approriate"   things to talk to strangers about in an online journal...  What things are people going to be interested in reading.... And then I sit here and think...   "who cares??"   This is a place for me to come and vent, and express myself! Sometimes I have a hard time doing that though... so please bare with me!  :)              So everybody is super-paranoid that I'm gonna go off the deep-end because of a certain new  "super-couple" .. *L*..   (j/k)   I'm very happy for both of you, really I am!!   Don't worry, I won't go all  "tv-movie-of-the-week"  on ya'll! I'm only a stalker for certain people! I do have to say however that if either of you hurts either of you  (make sense?),  that I will kick either of your asses!!   *MUAH!*   Okay what else... hmm... yeah.. nothing I guess... except,          I really need to give a huge "Congratulations" to my best friend and her boyfriend!! They are going to be parents!! I'll be an "auntie"!!!! I'm very excited for them both and wish them a healthy, happy, beautiful baby!!  Alright, that's all that's on my mind at the moment... I have to give it time to recooperate! *L*             To all the supercool girls out there and one especially supercool guy...  LATER!!!     nicegrrl xoxo
