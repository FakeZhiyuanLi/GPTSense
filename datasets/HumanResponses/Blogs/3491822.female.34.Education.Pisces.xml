						   Oaky, this is a little new to me.  I don't usually share my thoughts with anyone and am hoping it stays that way.  I have discovered that it is helpful to put my thoughts into words.  That makes what I am thinking a lot more concrete and realistic to me.  What I mean to say is, just like when a thought is spoken, once it is written and someone reads the thought it is real and can't be taken back.  So, as I begin a new chapter in my life with a new job and a move for my family, I thought I would try something new with jounaling my thoughts.  Maybe something profound will come of this.

						   Many times I have had the opportunity to start new.  Usually, I get that feeling at the beginning of a new school year.  It is the chance to start fresh and use new ideas.  In the past five years we have had the chance to start new many times just based on the number of times we have moved.  Every time we move I have plans to exercise more, eat better, lose weight, and begin or finish some kind of project.  I have never actually stuck with any of those plans.  Or I guess I should say, I have never stuck with all of the plans.  Last fall I did a great job of exerciseing and actually saw results by October or November, I was able to do it because I developed a routine that worked for me.  Since I have been working in Brookings I have tried to get into an exercise routine and haven't figured out the best routine yet.  Anyway, I think in the past I have tried to do too many things and was expecting huge results instantly.  What needs to happen is a change in the personal habits I have developed and giving myself a chance to reevaluate what isn't working.  So, once we get this move over with these are the things I need to work into my routine; 1. exercise - 4 -5 times per week, 30 minutes 2. eating habits - limit pop, fried foods and sweets, eat smaller meal portions, no food after 7pm, drinks lots of water, include fruits, vegetables and milk 3. prayer, devotion or personal time daily  That's good for now.  I am hoping to use this blog as a daily reflection of my progress. I will see how things go.

						   What do I think about when I am working?  I do a lot of daydreaming.  Which is good an bad.  I like to think I am using my time well when I daydream but I don't usually remember what it was I was thinking about.  Most likely making lists and planning what I am going to do when I am done with the task I am on.  I wonder if I would feel more fulfill if I thought about what I was doing when I was in the middle of the task?  The reason I was thinking about this topic is because I was reading something that a friend of mine wrote when he was completing a regular core type task.  I was amazed at how he thought of something very profound as he completed that task.    As I work to learn how to do this new job that I have started I am having to be very open to everything.  I can't say I don't know how to do that task so I won't do it.  I have to learn how to do all the work that is required of me.  Yet, I am also amazed at how I do not feel overwhelmed at what I am doing.  Many times in the past few days as I have worked with my boss she has mentioned something that I will need to do and I think, I wonder how I am going to do that task.  I guess it is a good thing that I haven't been thinking I can't do that.  Good work!!
