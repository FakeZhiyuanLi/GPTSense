      Wednesday, June 30, 2004 mood:happy- for no apparent reason  Okay-so- IM bored.. Today was a usual day. EXCEPT- Dexter didnt make fun of me ONE time today. i was so happy.. i still want to know what he wrote on that paper yesterday before he threw it away..(BTW- yesterday, i wrote Dexter a note that said something to the affect of "enough is enough.. we are tired of your crap." {cept it was a lot longer than that} then he started writing on it,.. then crumpled it up, threw it away and started throwing pennies at us..so thats what im talking about) today he did role around like he was on a skate board.. but never said anything.oh well.. my "team of professionals" are still getting orders tonight to cream his truck.. he learn to listen the  first  time we tell him to stop. Anywho- Amy left school today at 10:30 b/c she had a "doctors appointment" YEAH RIGHT! by the end of the day- everyone new she was going to G'ville to get her belly button peirced.. i wonder how they found out.. cuz i seriously didnt tell.. oh well.. one more day of school and we are home free. so umm.. yeah. i got church tonight.. wich makes me a little nervous for some odd reason.. i think im just stressed and dont really wanna go anywhere. but i love going to church.. so.. i guess ill run.. ill be back, Jack..  (I LOVE CRAIG!)  OUT

      Monday, June 28, 2004 mood: Kind of upset  This year has sort of been a rough one for me, but I didn't actually realize how bad it was, until I saw how bad my friends took it. I wasn't "Miss Popularity" (thank goodness) but I had A LOT of friends.. And they came in a variety. Some people think you have to have ALL short friends, or ALL skinny friends.. Its not like that. I have so many different kinds of friends, its awesome.  I have a few people who dress in Abercrombie & Fitch (blah), and I have QUITE a few that like skateboarding as a passtime. I have some that are quiet little brainiacs...and some who are loud pompous nussants. and I love them all. I wouldn't trade ANY of them for the world! but what gets me is how fast they can change.. One minute they are there, the next...They aren't. A lot of people take their friends for granted.Like if they have a problem they REALLY need to talk about, they'll just say "oh, "so-n-so" will be at school tomorrow, I can talk to them then." ... Well.. Hate to break it to ya, but they might NOT be there tomorrow..  or maybe they WILL be there tomorrow.. but its not the same caring,understanding friend you knew the day before.. At this point in everyone's life, someone is saying "Life is good"..and then the person that is standing right beside that other person, could be saying "screw this world...I cant take anymore crap.."  I guess my point is, don't be so self-centered with your feelings. Don't say "ill be okay. I don't need to talk about this. No one needs to know about my problems.. They'll think im weird." Chances are, that person is going through something so incredibly similar, that they will be absolutely THRILLED that you chose THEM to talk to..  OUT

      Monday, July 28, 2004 mood: so-so   Alright.. Monday.. Blah.. Today was just weird.. Okay, all last night i couldnt sleep.. i listened to music.. and even text messaged people all night!! i just couldnt get SOMEONE of my mind... (cc)  Finally, around 1:30, i got to sleep.. at 6:00, my alarm went off, as usual for ..yup! you guessed it.summer school.  So i got up, and i was on my way to the bathroom, and just happened to look over to my other clock in my moms bedroom, and it said 5:00... i was like " hmmm...youve got to be kidding me. i know it said 6 in there." So i walked all the way back to my room, and looked at the clock again, and it said 6:00..so i was like..okay..  i turned on the t.v. and it said "5:00"  so i finally just gave up and went back to sleep...  I woke up at 7:03.. Bo comes to get me at 7:20... i had 17 minutes to wash my hair, dry my hair, put my hair up, put on my make up, get on all my clothes, pack my lunch, and brush my teethe.. Luckily for me, he slept in just long enough for him to show up at my doorstep  while i was putting in some ear rings.. YAY! Then we went to get Billy. Billy is my cousin.. hes like, my favorite cousin from alabama.. and his brothers, brandon, and bradford. I got to see Craig today. i was so excited. hes such a great guy ! Dexter G. threw a bug in amy lou's hair today. she about flipped. and then she cried b/c a spider fell from the ceiling and landed right beside her. I felt so sorry for her b/c she is DEATHLY AFRAID of spiders, thunder, and hights. Well ..anyways.. im gonna go now.. i have nothing better to do.. c ya.. wouldnt wanna be ya.

      Sunday, June 27, 2004 Mood: Depressed  Today was just.. wrong.  Yesterday i was with one of my neighbors, and we went skateboarding.. Well when i went to step on my skateboard, i slid right off. i fell on my wrist.. It hurt so bad.. my neighbor brought me back to the house, and we put some ice on it.. i have it wrapped up right now, but i wont dare wear it to school tomorrow...(summer school)  Dexter G. always makes fun of me for being a *skateboarder*..hes the type of person that labels EVERYONE... i hate labeling people... it just makes me feel like a...labeler.... blah.. anyways- its not the fact that dexter calls me a skateboarder that gets me so upset.. its that he does it over and over and over again... and now he has ALL the guys doing it..it gets SO old.. and if he found out that i hurt myself while skateboarding, i would REALLY get made fun of..  I'm the kind of person who doesn't care what people think of me.. i just..DONT CARE,. but when it gets to the point where someone puts me in tears.. i think thats where it should stop.. and also, he calls amy a skatebaorder..and that sorta ticks me off b/c shes NOT,, she cant even stand UP on a skateboard.. i dont know why that makes me so mad.. it just does.. I do miss amy though.. on weekends like this.. i wish i wasnt banned from her.. i feel like, i have known her forever and trust her with ALL of my secrets... well i have had a pretty rough weekend...so im gonna go make some beef stew for my family, and hit the sack, jack! ciao.....

I met some of the best people i have EVER had the priveledge of meeting.. Aaron Moore, Austin Norton, Danny Miller, "Big E&nbsp; E-Z"("ERIKA"), Thomas, and a whole bunch more.... Austin was in my witness group.. and Danny was my best buddy... Aaron called me Wendy b/c he said i looked like Wendy from Peter Pan..

I found out from a certain source who found out from a secret source that someone that goes to church with me likes me.. actually i found out that quite a few of them like me.. but i only like a few of those few..     the one i really like is Craig.. but.. NEWS FLASH: relationship status as of yesterday: single..     yes.. im single once again..     CLASS 101 FOR GUYS -      TIP #1- do NOT ask a girl out when she hasnt even been single for an hour..

      July 15, 2004 mood: surprisingly happy   Today is the day i am leavin for the Kenny Chesney concert.. against my will..i dont have anything against Kenny ... but i dont listen to his music.. The only reason im going is b/c its my sisters birthday present and she asked me to go.(and b/c Uncle Kracker will be there.) (HOT STUFF) well anywho.. yeah..okay.. the reason why im writing this is b/c i had something that i wanted to write.. hehe.. but i forgot it.. so.. next subject.  Ever notice how things you say rub off on people?? For instance , Becky, amy's sister, was walking through a room and she said "wa-ha-hoppen?" (you'll have to hear it to understand it) and now me and amy say it all the time. or , my friend Curt, he says "But im just sayin" ALOT, and i catch myself sayin it...and Sam Bugbee and I have our own language called "Blibian" and now, when i walk around, i hear A LOT of people talkin like us.. it kinda ticks me off..b/c i think "I was original.. i came up with that. they can come up with there own crap.."  but at the same time, it makes me feel like they kinda , maybe, somewhere down in the depths of their heart and soul.. they look up to me.. i dont know.. you are prolly thinkin "k..shes weird."  well. DING DING DING! your a winner.. i AM weird.. i AM strange.. but im a good friend.. or at least MOST would say im a good friend.well.. hopefully.. actually.. thats something i would like to know. If you know me well enough to say if i am a good friend or not, leave me a post.. you can make it anonymous if youd like.. i just need to know if i am a good friend.  well.. anywho.. let me know..  ciao   OUT
