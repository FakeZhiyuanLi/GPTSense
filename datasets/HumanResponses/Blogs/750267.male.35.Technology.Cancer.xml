      Random Musings: * I don't understand American television's obsession with the show American Idol. Is this like the Survivor of two years ago? Why haven't I ever seen this show, other than the "top story" on Entertainment Tonight?  * I can't wait for Amazing Race 3. Amazing Race is an extremely entertaining and well produced show. I'd love to do it myself (and I would never do Survivor, and you would have to heavily medicate me to get me to be on Big Brother). Anyways, can't wait for it to be on.  * I wouldn't be surprised if that was it for The Mole. I enjoyed Mole 1 immensely, and Mole 2 was interrupted by a long delay - more than a year between when it was taped and when it was aired, which deflated some of the excitement. It was still an OK show, and Anderson Cooper has moved on to CNN or something as a real news man. He probably is hoping Mole 3 never gets made. Me too, kind of.  * Cannot wait for football season to start.(I love Will Ferrel's Hank Williams Jr. impression... They should replace the real Hank Williams Jr with Ferrel for at least one of the Monday Night Football games!)

       Bending Reality   Recently, so-called "reality TV" has contained less and less reality. I liked the original idea of Survivor - stick 16 people on a remote island, and through a combination of social interactions and producer-created contests, only one person will eventually be left to win.  Now that several of these shows exist, and in an effort to rescue TV ratings, producers are introducing unexpected twists into these games. Like on Survivor Africa and Survivor Marquesas, when the producers had the teams randomly switch, breaking up strong alliances and upsetting the balance of power in the game.  I can see why they wish to do this - after all, people will tune in when there is a lot of suspense and drama. If one person or team is clearly has a huge advantage, there is often very little suspense or drama.  But despite these ratings related goals, surprise changes in any type of contest are unfair. Imagine if the NFL introduced a new rule during half-time at the Super Bowl that drastically affected the game? Or if the finish line to a marathon were suddenly relocated during the race? Survivor, Big Brother, and all the copy-cat programs are, after all, a contest for real money.   These producers must clearly spell the rules out to the players before the game begins. They can keep the TV audience in suspense, if they must, for TV ratings. But the players should not be surprised by some mysterious twist the producers dreamt up the night before to improve ratings.  If somebody has used a brilliant stategy to build an unbreakable alliance, or in any way gained an upper hand in the contest, the producers have no right to arbitrarily change the way the game works in response.  Just my two cents. Mark Burnett, if your reading, please take note. Scott

       Who is the Mole?  The Mole, season two, ended tonight, and I can't believe  Bill is the mole . I have been split between Heather and Dorothy for the last half of the season, finally settling on Heather.   Dorothy could not possibly be the mole if you think about it - she won a number of games at the last minute (car/greenhouse, & the mind puzzles). Moles do not win games at the last minute - they would be better off barely losing games. I also felt like Heather could not be the mole. She hadn't apparently sabotaged any games, and she physically looked too much like last season's mole, Katherine. So why, after eliminating these two in my mind, didn't I pick Bill??? That is the question...  I never, ever suspected Bill. One thing I decided early on was that people who were 'too nice' or were 'trying too hard' to win, for lack of a better term, could not possibly be the Mole. This eliminated Al, Bill, Lisa, Katie, Myra, Darwin, Patrick, and Rob. Whoops. I guess the mole can indeed be 'too nice'.

       Will Open Source End Up Destroying Paid Software Developers?  Companies that develop and sell software are generally evil. Take Microsoft, for instance. (Forget all that monopoly crap - I think that so-called anti-trust is a bunch of crap.) They sell Windows XP Home for around $150 a copy and add another $100 for the Professional edition. Why does an operating system have to be so expensive? They know that they are going to sell hundreds of millions of copies a year. That's $20+ Billion a year in revenue... Did XP cost $20 Billion to create? No, of course not. Even if it cost $1 Billion to create (making it the most expensive software in the history of software development), they could still charge $20 a copy and make a 100% profit every year!  But at the other end of the spectrum you have open source software. Is open source also evil? It's hard to tell. It's surely hard to argue against free - I like the ability to download an operating system (Linux), web server (Apache), database (MySQL), and programming language (Perl). Other than the hardware, you can set up a decent server environment for free.  So let's say you are a company that relies on server software - like Sun or Oracle. Is open source good for you? No, it might actually drive you out of business. Other than the established players, is anybody stupid enough to start a new database company in 2002? Or an operating system company? Entire categories of software (those that have decent open source versions) are off limits to new competitors. Netscape went out of business because their paid browser (Netscape used to cost $99) could not compete with a free one (and, well the free one was a better browser let's not forget).   How many companies will go out of business due to open source? How many will not even be formed? Is open source killing jobs and killing innovation, even worse perhaps than Microsoft? After all, companies can compete successfully against Microsoft (AOL vs. MSN, Intuit vs. MS Money, CNN vs. MSNBC, etc.) You have to be able to adjust quickly (Netscape could not adjust). But can companies compete against free??? Time will tell...  Scott

      I saw a news report yesterday on an American television channel, that said while the Pope was in Mexico, he canonized the first "Native American" saint.  Political correctness ruins another sentence. They're afraid to say the word "Indian", so even though the poor fellow was from  Mexico , he becomes a Native  American ...

      I just witnessed the longest play in  urlLink NFL history  - a 108 yard missed-field-goal return by the  urlLink Baltimore Ravens . Wow. Everyone on the field thought the play was over, as the clock ticked down to 0:00 in the first half. Smart play by  urlLink McAlister . Wow! My mouth is still open, 5 minutes after the play is over!

      There is a new TV show called the " urlLink Jamie Kennedy Experiment ", and it is hilarious. (I say new because tonight was the first time I've seen it. I just discovered it's in its second season.) The basic theme has been done before --- place a hidden camera, throw in an actor acting weird, and watch people's reactions. Like Candid Camera has been doing for 50 years. But this guy, Jamie Kennedy, takes it to a whole new level.  On Candid Camera, the premise isn't that funny but people's reactions generally are, so they play the same joke on 30 people. "The coffee cup starts moving mysteriously... Oooo!"   On this new JKX show, it will take 10 minutes for me to explain the joke they played on ONE person. The episode I saw was hilarious. Not just a chuckle either, this was a good "belly of your stomach" laugh. I hope more people discover this unique show.

      I saw a blind man today, leading an elderly gentleman through the  urlLink Toronto subway .   Old man: "I don't know where we are supposed to get off." Blind man: "Don't worry - it's only two stops. First its Wellesley, and then its Bloor." A few moments later... Blind man: "We make quite a team, you and I."  I had to laugh - they did make quite a team.

      The governments of North American and Western European countries should enact a new law. All cars maufactured must meet some minimum fuel efficiency requirements. Period. Let's set the limit at 25 miles per gallon. I don't know how realistic that is, but I think thats reasonable to start.  If you want to buy a car that does not meet that minimum requirement, there is an additional $10,000 tax imposed by the dealership. So baseball players can continue to drive their Ferraris. This money would not just be consumed by the government. The money would be directly transferred to offset the cost of hybrid/electric cars, and the more efficient models. So while every SUV loving city-dweller would pay an extra $10,000, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Average can afford a nice hybrid car for $40,000 off the sticker price. Not a bad deal I say.  And perhaps gasoline taxes should increase for the consumer. We have to find a way of doing this without hurting airlines and truck transport (let's say they're exempt). But Regular Unleaded gas is $1 per gallon more expensive. The money from this would go directly into public transit - so they can buy environmentally friendly buses, increase service, and build more train/subway stations.  Don't get me wrong. I don't hug trees, and  urlLink I am a city-dwelling SUV driver . But I would pay the $10,000 more up front, plus $1,000 a year for the privelege. And if I don't like it, I can switch to a  urlLink VW Golf  or something.  Scott

      I am mildly looking forward to  urlLink Survivor: Thailand  tonight, but not for the reasons the producers might think. For the last couple of Survivor series, I didn't really care who won. The "contest" of Survivor was not so important to me. I will tune in to: - see Thailand - see a bunch of Americans starving (i.e.: the survival aspects, hunting your own food, etc.) - see the social interactions (i.e.: an old Navy Seal becomes best friends with a gay man, Whoo-hoo!)  I will say that I don't like it when it appears "fixed" -- i.e. when the producers obviously don't want some "mean or lazy" alliance to win, so they throw in an unannonced rule change. That's just not fair sportsmanship.

      The first episode of Season 2 of " urlLink Enterprise " aired tonight. I thought it was excellent - the story proceeded at a brisk pace. One  urlLink Internet reviewer  complained about how easy last season's cliffhanger was resolved, but I didn't mind it at all. In fact, if it took too long to resolve, I'd be complaining how long and/or complex the plot was for what could be a simple solution.  All in all, a 9 out of 10.

      You know what, the television coverage of Sept 11 2002 was not so bad. I found myself watching the ceremonies, and generally interested in the documentaries that were aired that day. Our local network (the  urlLink CBC ) did a respectable job with the view from the Canadian perspective.  And by September 12th, it was all over. We were talking about bombing Iraq once again. Back to normal!  So, forget most of what I posted on September 6th. It all worked out fairly well.  Scott

      OK, we're coming up on the anniversary of September 11th.  This year, I only have one hope for that day. I hope the TV networks don't go overboard. I mean, there should be ceremonies and tributes, and I will be among the millions tuning in to watch. But I will bet that every TV station (both Canadian and American) plans to cover these ceremonies repeatedly from 6am til mindnight.   Now, I am all for "complete coverage" of important events, but there should be an element of viewer choice in the matter. I should be allowed to tune away - watch something else. Why should every TV channel from 3 to 33 devote a dozen or more programming hours to the same event? What's the point? What's the difference between one network covering the event and dozens?  Yes, I understand it's in a competitive environment, this is an opportunity too good for the TV networks to turn down. Hundreds of millions of people will watch some part of the ceremony that day. And the programming doesn't cost the networks one penny (unlike the Super Bowl or World Series, which costs hundred of millions of dollars to license from the sports leagues). And you can say that any network that has any "news" credibility will have to cover it like any important news story - why should CNN get all the glory (and ratings)?  Anyways, this has nothing to do with the tragedy itself, but the asinine way tv networks all "need" to be there to cover it, leaving us the viewer with no real choice (but to turn the TV off I guess).

      This is what I love about living downtown (and on the waterfront)...  This weekend there's an air show. As I type this, all types of jet (and non-jet) aircraft are flying past my window. I'm going to run to the roof of my building in a second to catch some of it.  A few weeks ago there was an Indy auto race. The sounds of high-rev engines waffling through my window.  And after today, all the tourists will go home and I will have the waterfront to myself for a few weeks before it gets too cold...

      Perhaps the one left-over thought about the aftermath of the Washington D.C. sniper is how often the words "death penalty" are being used in the media. Right away, they started asking so-called experts which state had the toughest death-penalty laws. And often times the media suggested that certain states are likely to prosecute them first because of various rules around death penalties (particularly since one of the snipers is considered a minor). The term "death penalty" is used more than the word "election", and we're only a few days away from that!  Honestly, who cares at this point? Will these two get convicted? Yes. Will they ever be free in society again? No. Will they get the death penalty in at least one of the three trials they are likely to face? Yes - of course. Why does it matter which state has an easier time killing people and which has a tougher time? Why are we rushing them to the gallows? You have them in custody. Trials, appeals, and death sentences take years, even more than a decade in most cases. Drop it, and move on.  The other two legal cases that bother me are Winona Ryder and Martha Stewart. Winona was caught shoplifting. You know what? My sister was once caught shoplifting. The police brought her home without charges, and she was banned from going to Towers department store ever again. Why is the Winona case being treated like it's a murder or something? Geez, fine her $1,000 and ban her from Saks 5th Ave if you must. Why is this such a big deal?  And Martha Stewart. Millions of taxpayer dollars (and lots of time) are being spent investigating whether she had a sell order or not. I once worked for a company that went completely out of business three months after being bought by another company. Our company had $30 million in cash when it was bought. Where did that money go? Noone really knows. But why are the police spending time investigating the crooks who bankrupted my company? Why aren't they investigating the dozens of billion-dollar accounting irregularities with such vigor. Poor Martha made a piddly $40,000 off her stock sale.

      Wow. They finally caught the two people responsible for the sniper attacks. If there's one thing I hate, it's predicting something, admitting that I was wrong, and then finally being proven right. So it turns out the sniper was caught because he was seen - good eyewitness descriptions led directly to their capture.  It turns out that one of the sniper suspects was seen "clearly" by a policeman, and the investigators had a great description of him for several days before the arrest. This policeman also picked this man out of a photo lineup with some certainty.  The oddest thing I heard today was that one of the snipers served in the Gulf War, actually disposing of Iraqi chemical weapons including Sarin. The suggestion being made is that being exposed to Sarin, even a little bit, can cause all sorts of psychological problems. A good defense lawyer would based his entire defense on this one theory.  Another interesting fact is that many of the recent serial killers in U.S. history (the sniper, Timothy McVeigh, Jeffery Dhamer, and others) have had U.S. military training. So the other defense theory could be, hey, the government taught these guys to be ruthless killers... Military training is essentially an accepted form of brain washing, right? Sir, yes sir!   I don't know what to think about that. Anyways, the sniper will never see the outside of a prison again. Death penalty for sure. Several states are fighting over who gets to kill them first. Sane, insane, who cares? They terrorized millions of people for three weeks, and killed 10 (or more if you count earlier crimes). I'm glad its over.  Scott

      Have you ever wondered where the origins of the name  John Doe  come from? So did I. Thank goodness there are people who have the time to research such things -- I am not one of them.  There is a web site, called  urlLink Word Detective  that has the answer to this question. According to them:    It turns out that the "John Doe" custom dates back to the reign of England's King Edward III, during the legal debate over something called the Acts of Ejectment. This debate involved a hypothetical landowner, referred to as "John Doe," who leased land to another man, the equally fictitious "Richard Roe," who then took the land as his own and "ejected," or evicted, poor "John Doe."  These names -- John Doe and Richard Roe -- had no particular significance, aside from "Doe" (a female deer) and "Roe" (a small species of deer found in Europe) being commonly known nouns at the time. But the debate became a hallmark of legal theory, and the name "John Doe" in particular gained wide currency in both the legal world and general usage as a generic stand-in for any unnamed person. According to Mr. Dickson, "John Doe" and "Richard Roe" are, to this day, mandated in legal procedure as the first and second names given to unknown defendants in a case (followed, if necessary, by "John Stiles" and "Richard Miles"). The name "Jane Doe," a logical female equivalent, is used in many state jurisdictions, but if the case is federal, the unnamed defendant is dubbed "Mary Major."    Well, you learn something new every day! Scott

      I've been fascinated over the past week or so about this sniper that is terrorizing the Washington, D.C. suburbs.  I made a prediction to some friends earlier this week that "this guy has finally made a mistake -- for the first time, several witnesses saw him and can describe him, its only a matter of days before an arrest will be made". Boy, was I wrong. The entire story (van/taillight/ladder/AK74/dark skinned) was concocted by one witness? And it turns out he was making the whole thing up? And so, as a result, the police has no (or at best, conflicting and confusing) information. If anything, the police are worse off today than they were a week ago -- at least a week ago the public was looking for anything, now the public is only looking for Arabs/Hispanics with creme colored vans and AK-74s!   Even if they eventually arrest the sniper, a good lawyer should be able to pull an "O.J." :: get an acquittal through confusing and conflicting evidence.  If we learned anything from the O.J. trial, its that if you get a high-profile case, with hundreds of detectives, lawyers, experts, witnesses, etc. Any piece of evidence can be made to look like anything. Every witness can be made to be a liar.   And, I distinctly remember watching CNN on Monday afternoon, and hearing the reporter say "It looks like the sniper has taken a long weekend off" or something to that effect. I wonder if this VERY statement on CNN caused the sniper to go out and shoot someone, just to prove the reporter wrong...

      " urlLink The Hunt for Red October " is on TBS tonight. I have probably seen that movie a dozen times over the years, and I will probably see it a dozen more. It's one of those movies you can see time and time again and not get tired of it. Too many darn commercials on TBS though.  I bought a digital camera on Friday - maybe the smallest digital camera I've ever seen. 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches. It's called the "SmartCam Mini V". I don't know who makes it - I searched the Internet for "SmartCam mini" and came up with  urlLink only 4 matches . So it's one of these nondescript Taiwanese manufacturers. But it's a hell of small camera. So far so good. I've taken a few dozen pictures with it over the weekend, and it's pretty good for the size and price. Not exactly film-quality -- maximum 640x480 resolution. But it fits in my jeans pocket without noticing.  We have a Chinese mall up here, just North of Toronto. Man, you can buy anything there. One store sells both clothes, and dried noodles. I am not joking - clothes and noodles in the same store. Of course, some stores are devoted to Hello Kitty merchandise. I don't get that, but to each their own I suppose. A few weeks ago I bought a tiny remote control race car there - 1 inch by 2 inches, that's how small it is. This place sells some cool stuff - cheap. It reminds me of  urlLink Stanley Market  in Hong Kong. Kudos to  urlLink Pacific Mall  - that place rocks.

      I had a dream last night that I had become a quadrillionaire. You know, a trillion dollars is hardly enough money to live on these days.  How did I earn all this vast wealth? Well, I met some aliens who gave me medicine that can cure every disease, and extends natural life by 50 years. I started selling injections of this medicine for $1 million per person. I once heard that there are over 1 million millionaires in the United States alone. How many of these wealthy individuals would give up a large piece of their fortune to cure their terminal illness, or extend their life? I bet most if not all would.  Or would these people not give me every thing they had to save the life of their sick or aging spouse or child? I bet you could sell 10 million doses of these things at $1 million each. That's $10 trillion dollars. When the ultra-rich have been cured, I would offer it to the middle class at only $400,000 per dose.  And I hear the first trillion is the hardest. After that, the money will come rolling in from other enterprises. And those aliens will be back to give me something else valuable to sell. How about a machine that produces an unlimited supply of gold? You see, a quadrillionaire in no time!

      So the question is, what is the purpose of going to war with Iraq. The White House would have you believe it is: - punishment for not complying with the U.N. - preventative strike to protect the United States  The United Nations has reached an agreement to bring Iraq basically back into compliance with weapons inspections, and the Americans oppose it. So that rules out the first point as the reason for war with Iraq.  Iraq can, in no way, launch an attack against the United States. These days their army consists of a bunch of guys riding camels. The worst they could do is Israel, and Israel is not the United States. Israel has a huge strong army, and it can defend itself fairly well. So that rules out the second point.   The real reason, of course, is: - Iraq has remained defiant against the Americans, after all these years, and it pisses the Bush family (both Sr. and Jr.) off.  Ari Fleicher said today about the cost of war with Iraq, "I can only say the cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than that. The cost of one bullet, the Iraqi people taking it (on) themselves, is substantially less than that, the cost of war is more than that."   So, the real reason is that they'd like to see Saddam ousted, preferably killed. Why don't they just come out and say that already?

      Here is a list of the 10 things I would love for Christmas. If I was utterly rich (which I might add is at least twice as wealthy as just plain rich), I would buy them today:  1. Flat panel  urlLink LCD monitor . Bigger the better. Good, 17" LCD.  2.  urlLink Digital camera . One of those $600 4-megapixel puppies.  3. Wireless network. Not only do the devices  urlLink look awesome , I could get rid of this ugly bright blue CAT-5 cabling to goes from my office to my living room.  4. Ultra-light laptop. My 10-lb laptop is killing me -- I would love one of those  urlLink 2.5-lb babies .  5.  urlLink Sony Cli� . Listen to music, take pictures, PDA... gorgeous and practical all in one.  6. A new cell phone.  7. A  urlLink DVD-RW drive  - 4GB data storage.  8. XBox, Playstation 2, Nintendo GameCube - any one, doesn't matter.  9.

      Internally, I'm really divided about the necessity to invade Iraq.  On the one hand, Saddam Hussein doesn't appear to be a threat to anyone (but his own people). Americans have let cruel dictators rule for years in dozens of countries, so just being a cruel dictator is apparently not enough to warrant an invasion. What's the big deal about giving inspectors another six months? As long as he's cooperating, let them tear the place apart. Why do we have to invade today? Can't it wait until tomorrow? What is the "clear and present danger" to steal a movie title?  On the other hand, this isn't a game of hide and go seek. He'll be able to hide these weapons forever. It's like a huge shell game. You look under one coconut shell, and the ball is actually hiding in one of the other 20,000 coconut shells on the table. It's a game you'll never win. Saddam has gotten good at these switch games. And why should we stand around and let him make a fool of us.  What would be ideal, of course, is if weapons inspectors found something. Anything. A warehouse full of sarin gas for instance. Or if Saddam did something so outrageous (like kick inspectors out of the country) that we would have no choice but to go in there. But for now, he's playing this game, waiting to get caught in a lie.  Part of it might be the fact that I just don't like George Bush. I don't like him and I don't trust him. He's like a big cowboy, who's only solution is to go into the saloon and shoot everything up. You can kind of tell he's keeping something from us. He's like a kid in elementary school who has a secret and is dying to tell you. He'd love to be able to say, "Saddam's personal chef is a CIA operative!" or something. Being the President must be tough. Day 1, they tell you that aliens did indeed land at Roswell. Day 2, they tell you that the NSA really did kill John F. Kennedy. And Day 3, the shocking news that scientists really can make a battery that lasts forever, but the powerful Duracell lobby group keeps enough funds flowing into politicians pockets to stop that news from coming out.  There's a web site called  urlLink TradeSports  that allows you to bet on certain world events. For example: - As of this evening, you can win $2 for every $1 you bet if you believe Saddam will NOT be in power on March 31 - You can win $0.50 for every $1 bet if you believe Saddam will NOT be in power on June 30  You can also bet on whether there will be a second U.N. resolution. Odds are currently heavily against that happening.   I'll admit that I have a few bucks down on the outcome. I think Saddam will be able to keep power for a couple of more months at least. Even if the U.S. invades in mid-February, he still might be able to hold power for a month or two after. I also think the U.S. will seek and receive a second U.N. resolution before June. Easy bet there. The U.S. is  desparate  for the U.N.'s approval.  Scott

      Here is my random musing on the current copyright law debate.  Up here in Canada, CDs cost around C$20 (US$13) at the retail level. I believe it's even worse in the States where CDs cost C$30 (US$18). So, based on the Canadian prices, we are paying approx. $2 for each track on a CD.  Now, in the world of pop music, you simply can't listen to an entire CD. That is, there are usually only "1 or 2 good songs" on those types of CDs and the rest is filler. Pop music is just like that. This ain't Jazz and it ain't Rock and Roll. So each song really goes for $7 or $10 at the retail level. That's just too much money for 1 song.  "Compilation" CDs are a good deal -- someone has gathered the 15 top hits of the previous year and sells them on a single CD. Of course, compilations are by definition "old" music, so the record companies don't mind this. But consumers don't want to hear "I'm Like a Bird" by Nelly Fortado. That's so 2001, and we've had enough thank you.  Which brings us to file trading. Instead of shelling out $20, you can shell out $0 and get 15 top hits from today. Make your own compilation, for free. This is wrong of course, and the music industry can't continue to exist with so many freeloaders.  So what can we conclude from this simple analysis.... Currently, record companies do not give consumers what they want. Since consumers can easily take what they want, they do. Why don't record companies just try selling what people want to buy, namely: - Make CDs cheaper at retail. How about $9 for an entire CD? - Allow consumers to purchase current songs to make their own compilation? $5 for 15 songs that you can burn to a CD yourself, or download to an MP3 player -- no restrictions. The reason downloaded songs should be cheaper than CDs ($5 vs. $9), and not the same price, is that record companies save the cost of distribution and packaging.  I feel the record companies are partly (mostly) responsible for this mess they're in. I have some sympathy for them, but seriously: it's their own fault for ripping us off for so long. They rip the consumer off, and then rip the artist off, and then have the nerve to cry to us when they feel they are getting ripped off? Ha! Two wrongs don't make a right, but it sure does even the score a little.  I read this month's Wired magazine special, featuring Hilary Rosen of the RIAA. I still don't see the record company side of the issue. How can they justify their user unfriendly pricing and distribution methods? If a record industry exec is reading this, send me an email. I am serious: How can you justify the cost of a CD, and the lack of consumer options when it comes to using that music?  Scott

      What the heck ever happened to Bobby Brown's career? I mean, he was Mr. 80's. He seemed like he had it all -- success as part of a group, and success alone. Married one of the most popular female singers of that time, Whitney Houston. Not that her career is any better. She continued to have hits into the 90's though, which is better than Bobby Brown can say. Mind you, the last five years have not been kind to either of them.  Now they look and act just like an old trailer-park couple -- I imagine a lot of stuff gets thrown about that house. A lot of empty liquor bottles in the recycling bin too.  Would they have turned out this way if they hadn't met each other? Would his career still exist, and would she still be considered one of the best female performers?

      I was walking in Eaton Centre on Friday, and guess who I saw...  urlLink Lou Pearlman . "Who?", you say. This guy is best known for being the brains behind the  Backstreet Boys  and  N*Sync . He was also featured on the ABC show "Making the Band" for three years for his third boy band,  O-Town . That's the only reason I know what he looks like.  From his web site, I learnt that he was the guy who started Trans Contentintal Airlines (an airline charter service), and Art Garfunkel is his first cousin.  Anyways, inside the mall he was standing around 5 or 10 "pretty boys", whom I know is probably the latest boy band that I didn't recognize. I think a Toronto band, B4-4 was there - at least I recognized one of the members of that group. Oddly enough, there were no rabid fans mobbing them or anything. Everyone was pretty much just walking around them. Well, I guess some pop stars can go shopping like normal people. He he.

      Both the common language runtime (CLR) on which .NET applications run, and the C# language itself are open standards which anybody is free to implement. CLR -  urlLink http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-334.htm  C# -  urlLink http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-335.htm   Java, by the way, is not an open standard. It's proprietary, which means you need Sun's permission (ie: licensing) to create Java compilers and application frameworks. (There's nothing wrong with that per se, but how does this make Sun any better than Microsoft?)  In fact, there are a number of (open-source no less) projects underway to port the CLR to run under Unix and Apache.  The Mono Project -  urlLink http://www.go-mono.com/   Pretty soon, you'll be able to develop .NET applications (XML Web Services in ASP.NET even) without a single Microsoft product in sight.  If you're worried about Mr. Bill, I would also be worried about Mr. Scott (McNeely, CEO of Sun) and Mr. Larry (Ellison, CEO of Oracle). Both these companies would be just as nasty and ruthless and monopolistic were they "in charge" as our friends at Microsoft are. It's just like politics -- it's easy to appear to be a "good guy" when you're not in power, but when you are the clear market leader, it's hard to resist the lure of profits at the expense of customer service.  Perhaps the best solution is not to be married to any one vendor. Use a mix of Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, etc.

      I read recently that the Pope has approved the first miracle attributed to Mother Theresa. In the Roman Catholic church, it takes two confirmed miracles to make you a saint. So Mother Theresa only needs one more miracle to become a saint. The gist of the miracle attributed to her was that someone who was sick prayed to Mother Theresa and was cured of the disease.  I also read that in the 20 years since John Paul II has been Pope, he has canonized more saints than all of the previous popes combined. Think about it for a second, more saints have been created in 20 years than in the previous 1,400 years.  What's wrong with that? Lots of things I say. First of all, I don't believe in miracles. I believe there is a God, there has to be. He created the Universe, how else could it have been formed. But that's where his involvement in our lives ended. He started the ball rolling, and everything that occurred since that time has been due to the Physics and the Laws of Nature. That LIFE exists is a miracle. That someone thought they saw an image of the Virgin Mary in the mist of a waterfall is not.  (Every once and a while the Toronto Raptors win a game, which can be considered a miracle I guess too. But I digress.)   Second of all, just because someone lived a good life (or a great life -- Mother Theresa is often cited as the epitamy of kindness and selflessness) does not make them an actual saint. Sorry. That's not how it should work. There are tens of thousands of people like Mother Theresa -- nuns and missionaries who have devoted their lives to helping the less fortunate -- who will not have enough "fame" to be made into a saint. It shouldn't be a popularity contest. There should be an injunction on the granting of sainthood for 50 years. Or perhaps some future pope will recind sainthood from a few hundred of the less worthy...  It's kind of like all those Universities that grant Doctors degrees to movie stars. Bill Cosby has a Doctor's Degree -- and for what? Doesn't that diminish the value of the people who earned their doctorates? Doesn't thousands of new saints diminish the value of the existing ones?

      Traffic has been a nightmare recently, mostly due to the weather. But worse than that is the idiots who think that the way to solve that particular problem is to pass dozens of cars using highway on-ramps and off-ramps.  Yes, they get to pass 20 cars at once, but those 20 people have to wait just a little bit longer to get home. So you save yourself 60 seconds by stealing (and that's what it is, a theft) 3 seconds from me and 19 other people.  The police should really crack down on those idiots. A couple of $100 tickets will help drivers resist the temptation to be wholly inconsiderate to others on the road.

      I might have a mental illness, I'm not sure.  I got addicted to Bachelorette. Thank god she picked the sensitive one over the pretty one. Good luck to them.  And I caught "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here". Well, first of all, they sort of stretch the limit of the word celebrity. OK, Chris Judd, who's only claim to fame is that he was married to Jennifer Lopez for 5 minutes? Melissa Rivers, the daughter of a third-rate celebrity? A playboy model who is Iain Ziering's (from 90210) ex-wife? Rod Stewart's ex-wife? Ok. "I'm related or once was married to a half-celebrity" is about to begin. I swear they're probably taping this on some back lot in L.A. The jungle does not seem real.  It's interesting that they're doing it live. That's all I can say about that.

      This is the second week of  urlLink the diet . The second week has been a lot easier -- I wasn't feeling faint at all this week. And I managed to keep my mind off food -- no cravings.  I still haven't lost much weight -- 5 pounds only. But perhaps the biggest lasting effects from this diet are:  - a better appreciation for fruits and vegetables (I hardly ever ate them before) - enjoying the feeling of not being full - I'll be more careful with snacks and late-night eating  I still hope to lose weight with this thing. I'll give it one more week -- if I don't lose any more weight, I'm dropping it.

       Google: a Right or a Privilege?   A few years ago, I received a tip from a friend. "You should try Google", he said, "It's amazing." The reason why it was amazing, apparently, was how relevant it's search results were. "No matter what you are searching for, there is a good chance the first few search results returned will contain exactly what you're looking for."  I tried it myself, and I had to admit, it was amazing. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I used another search engine. Relevance rules.  I was not the first to discover Google, and I sure wasn't the last. Over the past few years, Google has surprised everyone by becoming the reigning king of search engines. Remember Altavista? Or Lycos? Or HotWired? What ever happened to those guys?   Google = Power  It goes without saying that a high ranking in Google can be worth millions of dollars in advertising and Web traffic. For example, the first Web site listed in a Google search result might expect to receive ten times the Web traffic of the site in the 10th position.  Other search engines realized this fact a year or two ago, and began selling placement in their indexes, sometimes to the highest bidder in an auction. In fact, Yahoo has stopped allowing free listings in some of its business categories. You have to pay if you want to get listed in their directory. Period.  So it's no surprise that people that run commercial Web sites work very hard to get high placement in Google. They play around with different keywords, meta tags, and Web page content to try to find the magic formula. Similarly, search companies such as Google keep their magic formulas secret, to ensure their indexes continue to return the most relevant results.   Search Results Have Become Serious Business  Recently, an Oklahoma-city based company filed a lawsuit against Google because it's Web sites appear to have been intentionally "bumped down" in Google's ranking system. They are suing, in effect, to force Google to rank them higher.  What makes this case interesting, though, is the type of business that has filed the lawsuit. The plaintiff in this case is a "Web site network" that claims they have developed a system that can fool Google into ranking sites higher in its index. They sell their services to Web site operators who want their Web sites to appear near the top of Google search results.  So let me get this straight, their business is that they can trick Google into ranking sites higher? And they are suing because Google caught on to that trick and is actually ranking those sites lower? Frankly, I don't see the problem.   Who Owns Search Results?  Sure, there are those that argue that Google has no right to alter its search results. After all, it should be a level playing field where every Web operator has an equal chance to be listed in Google. No one likes to see a game where the rules are murky, and can change at any time at the whim of an unseen judge. (Well, there are exceptions to that rule. People still watch "Survivor", even though those rules keep changing when the producers don't like the results. But I digress.)  Besides, allowing Google to arbitrarily decide which Web sites gets listed in their results and which do not gives them way too much power. Who knows... they could quietly begin to filter out opinions that they don't agree with (like this one), or perhaps skew results in favor of certain business partners. This is the "information should be free" argument - let search results be unbiased and unfiltered.  But the counter-argument is that Google is popular only because it returns relevant results. If some sneaky "Web networks" figure out a way to beat that system, Google will start to return results that are less relevant to its users (you and I). If anything, Google should be suing this Oklahoma-based company for attempting to reduce the value of its business!  Google is a private company who provides the Web-surfing public with an extremely relevant search engine. That means that they have to work hard to keep out the spammers who want to try and corrupt the results, and I for one am glad they do.  &copy; 2003 -- Scott J.

       Rip. Mix. The Music Industry Gets Burned.    Technology presents some interesting challenges to the traditional application of copyright law. A fierce debate is raging at this very moment over the proper boundary between our rights as consumers and the rights of copyright holders. So why is the record industry still clinging to the old business model for dear life?  Like many people, I have an extensive DVD and CD collection. I would guess that over the past two or three years, I have spent more than $1,000 on DVDs alone. I'm one of those people who see a movie in theaters, and if I enjoy it, I'll purchase the DVD when it becomes available � movie studios must love people like me.  There are several reasons that make owning the DVD attractive for me: * The ability to watch the movie any time I wish, as many times as I wish * The extras included in the DVD (documentaries, commentaries, out-takes, etc.) * The quality of the experience when played on my home television and stereo system  Movie studios have nothing to fear from me. My wife and I spend $50 on the movies that we enjoy when all is said and done (which if you think about it is still way too much), and the availability of movies for download off the Internet does nothing to diminish that for us. I've sampled some of the movies available online, and if the file sizes and download times doesn't get you, the poor quality of the video and sound surely will.  Unfortunately, what is true for the movie industry is not true for the music business. Despite how impractical it is to download a movie, it is extremely practical to download music. It's fast�a song can generally be acquired in only a few minutes. It's free�illegal but free. And the quality of the end product is better than what the music companies provide.  What? How can I say the quality is better? Well, think about it like this... If I download a dozen of my favorite tunes and burn it to a single CD that I can play in my car, is that not better than having to purchase a dozen CDs, and having to be my own record DJ while I'm driving, swapping CDs after every song?  But wait, you say. You can always purchase the dozen CDs, then burn your own compilation CD of those. That's legal, right? Well, no actually. You can't even do that. So you see, the current illegal method is actually a significant improvement over the way music companies currently allow us to be able to use their music.  So how can the record industry save itself, then, when their annual sales appear to be in a free-fall in recent years? What must they do to make money, and at the same time keep control over the distribution of their music?  Well, the answer surely must involve lowering the retail cost of music. $8.99 for a CD is more than reasonable, even considering the cost to develop the artists and produce the material. $18.99 for a CD is a rip-off, pure and simple. From what I hear, the actual artists actually get the short end of the stick anyway when it comes to the production of music.  More convenient methods for digital music delivery must also be there�it is certainly true that there is no incentive to buy a CD when there is only one or two good tracks. Most CDs are used for a month or two and then sit in the CD rack never to be used again anyway.   And the freedom to do whatever we wish with the music�burn our own compilation CDs, download to MP3 player, etc.�also must exist for this model to work. The music companies are currently experimenting with their own music download services that are still quite expensive and severely restrict what you can do with the music. That won't work.  It's up to the record companies to figure out how they can make a profitable business out of this. But digital music is here to stay�no lawsuit will stop it at this point. The only question is do we have to keep stealing it, or will you make it easier for us to acquire legally?  &copy; 2003 -- Scott J.

      It's interesting to see the progress that is being made in anti-spam software over the past few months.   Check out  urlLink this interesting approach . The project is called POPFile, and the software supposedly does a pretty decent job of detecting spam. Not only that, but there is almost nothing spammers can do -- there is almost no way to defeat it. The program classifies the emails I receive based on the statistical probability of certain words appearing in spam. At first, I need to "train" the software by classifying my mail as either spam or not spam. It does the rest. For instance, certain words (like viagra, debt, free, diet, etc.) appear mostly in spam, so when a new mail comes in, the software can make a decent guess of whether its spam or not.  What's interesting to me, is that in the last six hours since I installed the software, I have received nothing but spam. I'm finding it hard to train it to recognize my "personal" mail, because I haven't received any this afternoon.  Yes, that's a sad story in a way. Maybe I shouldn't filter out the spam... it might be too quiet without it.

       urlLink The diet  is all I can think about. I have a headache that comes and goes. Today I felt faint a few times, and couldn't keep my eyes open at work. I needed a serious nap between 1pm and 2pm, and that never happens to me.   But, I'm not going to quit yet. If it works, it is worth it.  urlLink Hunger is an illusion  I suppose -- it's a trick your body plays on your brain. For 33 years, that little trick has caused be to go down and grab a snack at 3pm or munch on some chips or popcorn at 10pm. You can be hungry simply because you're bored. My body has been trained to expect a snack 'whenever it wants it'.  Here's the rub. In the last two days, I have been eating nothing but healthy food. I had a lovely dinner of carrots, broccoli and hot dogs (without the bun). OK, there are those who would argue that hot dogs are not healthy. But the body needs meat -- in my case, all I ever usually eat is meat. Hot dogs are as good as a chicken breast or a slice of lean beef. Let me tell you though, those hot dogs were the best tasting hot dogs I've ever had. You don't understand the tastiness of food unless you subject yourself a bit of hunger every now and then.  I feel like Homer Simpson... Mmmm... Hot Dogs...  But I digress... I have been eating carrots, cottage cheese, string beans, beets -- man oh man. This is so not me.  Mmmm... carrots...

      I started a diet today. This is my first actual diet. Man, am I hungry right now!  A few months ago, I tried changing my eating habits. I switched from  urlLink regular coke  to  urlLink diet coke . Started adding low-fat milk to my coffee and even switched from sugar to sweetener. You know, it really had no effect. I was convinced that saving 500 or so calories a day would make a big difference. But in the end, nada. Zippo. Zilch. The big goose egg.  Then I started tracking my calories. Found this  urlLink cool USDA web site , and was happily entering my daily food consumption. The site actually convinced me to eat a more balanced diet -- I would go down and grab an orange juice as my afternoon snack instead of a diet coke. Drinking 1 orange juice a day brought my daily fruit intake from 0% to a decent number (50%). That lasted about a month. Again, no effect.  So this  urlLink new diet  is crazy. I'm eating all these weird foods at odd times, some I never eat. I had peanut butter on toast for breakfast this morning, a can of tuna for lunch, and chicken, beets and string beans for dinner. That might sound like a normal meal to you, but other than the chicken, I never eat any of those foods. Beets aren't too bad actually, never even had them before.  How the heck am I going to last 12 hours until my next meal? I am starving...

      My agent wants to know if I'd like to write a book on Mac OS X. I know nothing about Mac, but I gave a brief thought to writing a book on the topic. It would give me an excuse to go out and buy one -- I've never used one before, and have always been curious about what those Mac-huggers have been ranting about. I'm almost (almost, I said) jealous about these people who are soooo fanatical about this company. I wish I had a company or a brand I could love. Why is a brand of computer so special? Us PC-huggers don't understand that. I have no loyalty to any brands -- sell me a no-name PC as long as its cheap. I did like my Dell laptop very much, and have a positive attitude toward Dell, although it won't be a deciding factor   In fact, I drink Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke interchangably. I go to Wendy's, Burger King, or McDonalds. No brand loyalty that I can think of. My last three cars have been all different manufacturers.

      I looked back through my blogging history, and I can't believe I haven't talked about Connie Chung before. That woman annoys me to no end, and with the recent announcement that her CNN show was cancelled, I thought this would be a good chance to mock her a little bit. Mock mock.  I caught her show in the first week it was on. In it, she was lambasting a guy who had sued the government over the Pledge of Allegience. Essentially, this guy was arguing that he did not believe in God, he is raising his daughter not to believe in God, and his daughter's school is forcing her to pledge allegience to "one nation under God". Chung ripped the guy apart. "Are you proud to be an American?" she asked. "Are you prepared for that tag ... 'The Most Hated Man in America'?". This poor fellow, who's only crime was that he thought the constitution protected his religious beliefs or lack thereof, was verbally abused on national TV. Once, Connie asked him if he thought it was selfish of him to persue this lawsuit (which he won by the way) considering the harm that could come to his daughter. The implications of that question are mind-boggling. I would suggest that if anyone harmed this guy's kid, it was their fault and not the father's. But obviously Connie thinks the father is "selfish" for asking the courts for freedom of religion.  Other interviews I saw were as bad or worse.  Once, Connie was interviewing the friends of Laci Peterson, the pregnant woman who was (and still is) missing in California. Connie asks the friends if the Peterson's knew the sex of the unborn baby. The friends said yes, it was a boy. Connie responded by saying something like "Aw, that's so sweet. You must be so excited!" My draw dropped when I heard her say that.  Someone should remind Connie that Laci Peterson and her unborn baby are probably dead. So I would guess the friends are more "sad" and "distraught" than "excited"... Those types of interview gaffs happened often on this show.  I also saw her interview a 15-year old student, who attended the same high school where a student was killed by the "D.C. sniper". Connie: "Are you scared to go to school tomorrow." Student: "No, not really." Connie: "Really? I can't believe that. You have to be a little scared right?" Student: "No, I'm not scared." Connie: "I really think you should be scared. I would be scared if I were you. Why aren't you scared?"  Oh please. The teenager said she wasn't scared. Did Connie think this kid was lying? That she really was scared but didn't want to admit it? Connie Chung made the teenager feel like an idiot for not being scared, and that made me uncomfortable. I was so outraged, I wrote Connie an email telling her she should be ashamed. I can understand (a bit) treating an accused murderer with such disdain (even though I do not like it as an interview technique, I understand it in that instance). But to treat a victim that way -- a 15-year old teen who just saw a fellow student murdered -- that's dispicable. She should have apologized to this kid afterward.  And so, Connie is gone. Bye. See ya later. Well, hopefully not too soon. She was an awful live interviewer, treating many of her guests with disrespect and disgust. Often she was caught not listening to what they were saying. Often she was getting the basic facts of the story wrong. Stuttering - um's, ah's - awkward silences while she thought up the next question. Or asking questions that leave no room for a proper answer. Or asking questions where there is only one answer. Cutting interviewees off mid-sentence -- "Are you finished yet?" Asking the same question twice: "Yeah, I just answered that. Weren't you listening to what I said?"  Anyways, give me more interviewers like Aaron Brown or Anderson Cooper. Smart, well informed, polite to their guests, and above all fair. Opinionated without being obnoxious. More of that. Less of Connie.

      My response to  urlLink Charles Cooper's ramblings  about how the world would be different if Netscape Communications had survived:    It still amazes me to read articles such as yours that look back fondly on the good ol' days with Netscape Communications. Perhaps you have forgotten what Netscape was really like back then.  In my experience, Netscape was not a customer-friendly organization. They were always more concerned with being able to say "our application runs on 16 different operating systems, including 12 versions of Unix" than to say that their application worked well in any of them or worked consistently across all platforms.  Case in point: - In 1996, I was working for one of Netscape's largest customers (40,000+ licenses of Navigator); Netscape even distributed a press release to announce the deal they signed with my employer - During this period, I was developing what the Netscape salesman at the time called the most complex web-based application in Canada - Netscape 2.0 would crash after showing 10 web pages from my application (can you say memory leak?). I had to change the way I was storing data from a client side approach to a server side approach to "lessen" the impact of the memory leak, but the leak was still there. - Netscape 2.0 had one particular HTML problem that I couldn't get around. I called Netscape support for help, and their response floored me. "We agree that this is a bug, but it's probably too late to fix it for the 3.0 release. It will probably be fixed when Navigator 4.0 comes out."  - To put this into perspective, my employer takes six months to test, certify and roll out new software to their employee's desktops. Even if 4.0 was released in 12 months, it wouldn't be available to my users for 18 months, so waiting until Navigator 4.0 was not an option for me. - In comparison, Microsoft treated their developers much better. I can remember getting Microsoft Support in Redmond looking into a particular IE bug, and getting to talk several times with an actual IE engineer (as opposed to a non-technical call center) who sent me a patch for my problem. It was resolved in less than a week. And MSDN has always been an amazing source of developer info.  IE surpassed Netscape in quality in its 3.0 release. Netscape has never been able to regain the lead in terms of a quality Windows product since then. If you ask me, Netscape's death should be ruled a suicide, by trying to charge money for a poorer quality product. To some extent, you can't compete with free. But you certainly can't compete if the browser you're charging money for just plain sucks compared to the free one.  Now the real question is, what would the Internet be like without Microsoft's innovations with IE? "Boring, buggy, and not useful for entertainment or e-commerce" is the answer to that one.

      The CBC has had some excellent Iraq coverage over the last couple of weeks. I am sitting now watching an excellent program where they are thoroughly answering viewer questions on Iraq. They're taking 10 minutes to answer each question -- excellent show. "How many UN Security resolutions are currently being defied?" At least 80. "Mostly because the countries involved are friends of the United States." Ha! Israel, Turkey, Armenia, etc.  Bravo CBC.

      I was thinking about something this morning on the subway, coming in to work:   Will Science ever be able to prove the existence or inexistence of God?   In 40 minutes of thinking about it, I could not think of a way. 10,000 years from now, when humans have reached beyond our own planet and perhaps even beyond our own galaxy, there will still be no way to prove God doesn't exist.  This line of thinking might have been triggered by a star trek episode, where Picard sets out to prove this chick who claims shes the devil (and is about to enslave a planet) is actually just a liar with advanced technology.  Picard's way of proving her wrong is that he was able to reproduce every "trick" she could perform, and eventually the enterprise found her ship and power source and she was defenseless.  Well, no such luck proving God is a con-man. But could we disprove his existence by replicating his tricks? Not so easy. If I could create a planet, that would be impressive. If I could create a new galaxy, I might be able to fool people into worshipping me. But who created me?  It's the old chicken and the egg scenario. Which came first? In reality, the chicken evolved slowly from some other animal, and so you can say neither came first. But who created us? Who created the universe as we know it? There can only be one answer.  Scientists have tracked the history of the universe back to when it was only 1 one-billionth of a second old (or something like that). They say they can't go back any further, because the laws of physics as we know them are not valid due to intense heat and pressure (millions of degrees celcius).  So, science can never prove the existence or inexistence of God. We will never know. If we live 10,000 years, we will still not know. If some entity shows up claiming to be God, and can create new planets and galaxies, we don't have the luxury that Picard had -- we can't replicate his tricks, so who are we to say he's not the real God?  Or (to go back to the star trek analogy) what's the difference between a "Q" and God? For humans, none.

      It's 2:40am, and I am watching the stupidest TV show I've ever seen:  urlLink Microsoft VBTV . You'd think Microsoft, the richest corporation in the world, could afford some decent production values. This show, about VB, has a laugh track.  In  urlLink this episode , there is a VB rapper, singing about VB.NET and web services. I've died and gone to hell. "Because I'm object-oriented and I'm on the net!" Ugh.

      In Canada, taxes are due April 30. Guess who's just doing his now?  For years (more than 10), I have been filing my taxes using tax software. Back in the old days, we used to have to print out our tax returns (on special BLUE paper) and then stuff it into an envelope (which barely fit) to mail it in. It wasn't long after that Revenue Canada (now called the CCRA -- our IRS) experimented with electronic filing. I must have been one of the first to try that. There was no Internet back then -- or at least, it was still acedemic at the time. That seems like 10 years ago at least.  So here I am, at 2:00am on the day they are due, filing my taxes. And what do you know... I discovered a bug in QuickTax. Off to the Intuit website. You know, for a company named Intuit, the web site is not very intuitive. It took me 1 minute to discover that the web site didn't have a record of my bug in its knowledgebase, and 29 minutes to find the phone number for tech support. "Intentionally hiding the tech support number -- a sure sign customer service is a top priority!"  To top it off, the tech support number is LONG distance for me. Geez, louise! Can't you even afford a 1-800 number? OK, I figure it'll cost me a few bucks on my phone bill -- I need to get this fixed tonight. I call the support number, at 2am remember, and am told by a computer voice that the current wait time " exceeds 60 minutes ". What? Excuse me? 60 minutes of long distance to talk to a rep who probably can't help me anyways. Uh, no thank you.  Why do I keep purchasing this software? These bozos at Intuit have proven, time and time again, that they are the most customer unfriendly company on the planet. 30 minutes just to find the phone number? At least 60 minutes on hold for a long distance call? This wasn't free software - I paid money for it.  Oh, the company did offer to help me right away for $20 (priority support). Hey, it's your bug! I'm not paying for support. Paying for tech support is the most ludicrous invention ever. I'd pay if it turns out I did something wrong, but not if you have a faulty product in the first place.  End of rant.

      I saw an interesting story over the weekend about one of the problems of returning Iraq back to normal.  In one day, four men showed up at American military sites in Baghdad claiming to be the former Chief of Police for that city and wanting his old job back. After doing some background checks, the Americans determined that none of the four men were actually the police chief. That strikes me as funny. Can you imagine the number of people who show up wanting their old jobs back, as government employees, etc.? How on Earth would the Americans be able to tell if someone is telling the truth?  I also saw a piece where people are annointing themselves to certain positions without U.S. approval. One guy is going around calling himself mayor of Basra. Many men are claiming to be police officers, and the Americans are having a tough time recognizing the real police officers from the self-appointed ones.  And finally, this morning I heard the Americans found $600 million in U.S. cash stashed away in one of the palaces. $600 million. In cash. Wow. Three things came to mind. One, that's a lot of paper currency. How the hell did Saddam acquire so much? Did he just call the U.S. Treasury one day and place an order? Second, do you think the soldiers were tempted, just a little bit, to stuff some of the cash in their boots. I mean, if $100,000 goes missing, noone will notice. Heck, maybe $605 million was found, but they decided to "round down" if you get my drift. If I was a soldier, I would certainly think about "liberating" some of that money if I thought I could get away with it free and clear. And the third thing that came to mind is, I wonder where that money ends up. I mean, is it like "drug money" in which the army gets to use it to pay its expenses? Will the CIA use it to topple the next regime? One thing is for sure -- you and I will never hear about this money again. People will forget, and the money will one day just disappear from its storage location.

      I've had  urlLink an idea similar to this  for years. SMTP should be changed to require some form of source authentication. Headers should not be forgable. Scrap the protocol if need be, who cares if some applications break or need upgrading. The insecure way of sending emails should no longer be supported - period.  The article suggests some form of secure digital certificate should be required as a prerequisite to sending email. And servers should enforce send limits. Those are good ideas, and I support them.  I think even a simpler approach would work. Basically, all email should be tracable to a particular source IP address on the Internet. No exceptions. How hard is that to do? My email client could then be configured to ignore all email from that source. In fact, ISP's can set filters upstream to ignore those emails for me.  Let's assume that most spam is sent by big honking servers located outside North America.  Block those addresses upstream, and blam. The amount of spam (and the amount of network bandwidth spent sending spam) are instantly reduced. How could spammers possibly get around this? Send spam from their own PC's. Blam. Those are blocked too and the spammer can't send any email, even legitimate. Hack into other people's servers (open SMTP relays), then Blam. Unsecure servers are blocked until the admins properly secure them. There is no way around such a system.

      I do all my banking through either the ABM machine or the Internet. The only time I have to venture into a branch is when I want to do something really obscure like foreign currency exchange.  A couple of months ago, I noticed a strange service charge on my account. Normally, I don't scrutinize the charges, but this was big enough for me to care. So I called the bank's 1-800 number. The lady on the other end reminded me why the fee was deducted, and as soon as she told me I was satisfied. But just when I was about to hang up, she asked me if perhaps I'd be interested in their lower fee account.  "Hold on a second", I said. "There's a lower fee account?" Yes, it's a new product they introduced a year or so ago, that would reduce my bank service charges by 66%. Instead of paying $15 a month on my business account, it would be less than $5. Nothing else would be different. The things I pay extra for now (Internet banking) would be included free.  Of course, I took the lower fee account. But why wouldn't they just charge me the lower fee to begin with? Why do I have to accidentally stumble into finding out about this new account type? If I qualify for the lower fee, call me or send me a letter ASAP! I want to be notified right away!  And today, I was talking to my cable company. Again, by accident -- there is a problem with my cable connection. As I'm speaking to the rep, he asks if I would like to switch to their bundled service. Huh? Oh, you can save $10 a month and it would be no different to what you're already getting. OK, switch me to the bundled service then.  The moral of the story, I suppose, is that people who subscribe to a service (cable, phone, bank, etc.) and leave it alone generally don't save money. If you check in with the 1-800 sales reps every six months, you can save some real money over the long term.  I might just phone my phone company today and see if there is anything they can do to lower my bill. And the cell phone people.   Scott

      A couple of years ago, I caught my 5-year old nephew calling his 6-year old sister "Monica Lewinsky" as an insult. She was greatly offended. Great shouting ensued. "No, I'm not." "Yes you are!" Once the fight broke up, I asked each of them if they knew who Monica Lewinsky was. Neither did, of course. But I found it funny.  Last week the same kids were calling each other terrorists. "You're a terrorist." "No, you're one!"  My generation was the MTV generation, I guess if their generation should be called the CNN generation.

      As an addendum to a previous post: Fact 1. Apple has $4.5 billion in cash Fact 2. Apple's market cap is currently $4.7 billion  Thus, the stock market apparently views Apple's business (of selling computers) as being worth around $200 million. In that light, AAPL stock is a bargin these days. But only if you think the company will continue to make a profit.

Microsoft should be giving away gifts again...

      Robert Cringely had an interesting article last month:  urlLink http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030213.html   He opined that Sun, losing money hand over fist these days, will go out of business in 5 to 10 years. Essentially, the combination of Linux with cheap Intel/AMD servers will dry up Sun's bread and butter -- it's server business. Noone will want to pay $60,000 for something they can get for $5,000, and Sun can't afford to drop their prices too far too fast - the economics are working against Sun big time. Robert states that Sun is really going to have to make a bold move in order to survive, but he doesn't know what that move should be.  I, for one, never liked the fact that Sun seemed obsessed with what Microsoft was doing all the time. Scott McNeely loved to make jokes about Microsoft and Bill Gates, and did so at every opportunity, but he should have been MORE obsessed about his own business, not Microsoft's. Novell had the same obsession, and look what happened to them. Apple, for a few years, was Microsoft obsessed too, but they turned things around with the iMac and now OS X. Folks, it's not rocket science. You win the race by racing as fast as you can from the start to the finish. Sun has spent too many years standing still, too many years making jokes, too many years trying to win by lawsuit what they couldn't win in the free market. Even if they win in court, there's no way to receover all those lost (directionless) years.

      I have so many things on my "to do" list now that it is scary. I wish I could clone myself for a couple of days, so that I would have a chance to get things done. After the work is finished, my clone would have to disappear of course. I enjoy being unique.  Question: let's assume science is finally able to clone a human, so I can order a clone of myself. How would you know which is the clone and which is the original? Probably by tattoos, piercings, scars, calluses, wrinkles, etc. Even a DNA-clone would not have those things... In fact, an exact clone would be "too new".  Another question: Do identical twins have identical fingerprints?

      Police  urlLink find the bodies  of a woman wearing maternity clothes and a baby boy along the shoreline of the same bay Scott Peterson said he was fishing. Could they be of Laci Peterson and her unborn child? There's a good chance.  On a  completely separate and unrelated note, why would you dump your wife's body in a lake, and then tell police you were fishing at the same lake at the time of the murder? When they find the body later, you've basically implicated yourself.  Scott

      I read  urlLink an article  (in the New York Post) that said both Microsoft and Apple were interested in buying Universal Music. The article said "the prospect of a tech giant like Apple or Microsoft delving into the music business is an affirmation that it is possible to make digital downloading profitable".  Is Apple a "tech giant"? I mean, no offense to all those that love the company's products, but can they be compared side by side with Microsoft? I kind of view Apple as a David, next to the big Microsoft Goliath. I'm sure alot of Apple fans do too. When I think tech giant, companies such as AOL, Sony, Philips, LG, etc..come to mind.   AAPL Sales: $5,742 Mil  Income: $65 Mil  Market Cap: $4,895 Mil    MSFT Sales: $28,365 Mil (+393% more than Apple) Income: $7,829 Mil (+11,944% more than Apple) Market Cap: $264,859 Mil (+5,310% more than Apple)       SNE (Sony) Sales: $57,117 Mil (+894% more than Apple) Income: $70 Mil (+7% more than Apple) Market Cap: $29,820 Mil (+509% more than Apple)  It appears that, on the basis of market cap, Microsoft is 54 times the size of Apple. Sony is 6 times the size. Microsoft being almost a pure software play is almost all profit. Apple, being mostly a hardware play, has very thin margins by comparison. Sure there are other ways to compare the two. But it would all work out the same in the end. Microsoft could purchase all of Apple at current market prices just with one year's profits, and have enough left over to buy every single American man, woman and child dinner at McDonalds including dessert.

      OK, I need to take a break from thinking about this silly war. My favorite TV clip from the past couple of days, the scene of three or four Iraqis pushing a cart full of stolen goods past American troops at a checkpoint of some sort, waving at the troops in joyful happiness... and the troops waving back. Yes, the sweet taste of freedom... being able to steal whatever you can carry, and burn whatever you cannot.  The saddest thing I saw was a scene of the empty Iraqi Museum, which used to contain artifacts from 5,000 years of human civilization. Heartbreaking. That treasure didn't just belong to Saddam Hussein. It didn't just belong to the Iraqi people. The treasure in that museum belongs to the whole world. A quote from CNN... "Here we see some ancient pottery that survived 5,000 years... until yesterday." Ugh.  Anyways, I'm tired of thinking about it.

      Yikes.

Now civilians are running around like wild bulls in a China shop, destroying everything in sight. Today I was reading about the destruction of schools and hospitals. People were walking into banks and walking out with an arm-load full of cash.  What do you do? You're committed to not hurting civilians, but the civilians are not behaving as you had expected. Parades, yes. Bank robbery, no.  Perhaps this was Saddam's plan all along. "You want Bagdhad? Here it is... take it. Good luck, I am outta here!"

      I am not the only one to mention  urlLink what has happened with Afghanistan , apparently. A quote from the Austrailian web site The Age:   Seventeen months later, such confidence looks grimly ironic. For most Afghans, "liberation" has meant the return of rival warlords, harsh repression, rampant lawlessness, widespread torture and Taliban-style policing of women. Meanwhile, guerilla attacks are mounting on United States troops, and the likelihood of credible elections next year appears to be close to zero.  Yes, what the U.S. has promised to undertake in Iraq is not going to be easy. I wish them the best of luck -- I really do. I've always said, if what the Americans appear to want to do actually works, Mr. Bush's and Mr. Blair's risky gamble will have paid off handsomely. The same way betting your house on a 45-1 long-shot at the racetrack will pay off handsomely. It's just not wise.

      Does anyone think the invasion of Iraq is really just a ploy to break up  urlLink OPEC ? I mean, the U.S. obviously doesn't want Iraq's oil. But maybe the U.S. wants to add to the list of countries that don't participate in OPEC. It's possible...  If enough oil production happens outside of OPEC's control, then OPEC will have no power. Member countries won't follow the production limits if other countries are not heeding those limits.   As you can see, I'm still struggling to come up with a motive that fits.

      When the U.S. invaded (and then quickly departed) Afghanistan in 2001, the Americans left behind a cabal of feuding warlords to run the country. While the Taliban brought peace to the country after decades of war, one can argue that the destruction of the Taliban has left Afghanis worse off than they were two years ago. So, recent history does not bode well for the Iraqi conflict.  And today, we're  urlLink reading  that Iraq has denegrated into lawlessness, while the U.S. troops stand by. I can understand Saddam's palaces being raided -- hey, raiding a palace is truly a symbol of a country's new found freedom. But Iraqis are raiding UN buildings, foreign embassies, homes of private individuals, private factories, banks.  Religious leaders (both Saddam supporters and U.S. supporters) are being killed by mobs inside Mosques! Families (mother, father, children) are roaming around trying to find something to steal.   This proves the American plan was not well thought out.   I, like many people in the world I guess, have been undecided whether this war is a good thing or not. In theory, I'd like to see the world freed of all brutal dictatorships. Sometimes a revolution needs a gentle push to get going. But what is happening in Iraq? Is it a revolution? Or is it just pure chaos?   And exactly what is the real American motivation for this war? Don't talk to me about oil or freedom. WMD I was starting to believe. Perhaps the purpose is to start a worldwide peace? Or worldwide U.S. domination? Or is it just fun to flex your military muscle sometimes? Use up some of the old bombs so we can have an excuse to buy new ones...  Look forward to more uncertainty on this issue. From me, and from the President.

      26-year old Esther Mok, a flight attendant from Singapore, is thought to have single-handedly  urlLink infected 133 people  with SARS, causing 9 deaths so far. Tragically, she's infected and/or killed her mother, her father, her pastor, her grandmother, and her brother... And yet, she has survived and is recovering.  Scientists are calling her a "super-spreader". (Which, coincidentally, is what Madonna was called in the 1980's...)  Seriously though, how would you like to be this girl who,  through absolutely no fault of her own , killed so many people or made them seriously ill and yet she  survived. If you're going to cause a nation so much grief and panic, it's almost better to end up dead afterward than to have survived it, don't you think?  I'd like to see this girl interviewed in a couple of years time to hear about how she was able to cope.  Scott

      There's  urlLink an interesting article  on CNet about the over-use of the term open.  It's interesting to note that it's written by someone who works for Sun Microsystems. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Java is not open source, nor is it open community by this article's definition. It may be an open standard, but it is not recognized by any official standards body so can it really be called a standard?  Anyways, it' ironic that Sun should be trumpeting openness when Java is closed.

       Aha! I just had one of those sudden revelations. You know, where you're eating leftover pizza at 2 o'clock in the morning and then the meaning of life becomes clear.... Well, not quite the meaning of life but the meaning of war at least, it's a start.  OK. I'm convinced... this is the REAL reason the United States is waging a war on Iraq:   The world is a garden. Every country in it is a flower. Every flower is different, and that's what makes it a beautiful garden.   But nestled in amongst this mostly beautiful garden are some weeds. The weeds have been there for years (decades in some cases), and although the flowers didn't like the weeds, they felt there was nothing they could do. "Weeds are plants too", and they have a right to exist in nature. The flowers just had to learn how to live with the weeds.  Some tried to organize together and "contain" the weeds. They would build little fences around the weeds and try to convince them to stop acting like weeds. They would pass resolutions to try and get the weeds to comply. All in all, it wasn't working, but again, what else could they do?  Then one day, one of the little weeds struck down one of the flowers in a senseless attack. The whole garden was outraged (even some of the other weeds!), and so they all got together and killed the weed that did that. Everyone believes the garden is a much safer place for all without that nasty weed.  But that gave some an idea... wouldn't the garden be a nicer place for all flowers if there were no weeds at all (or at least, some of the other biggest baddest weeds were gone)? Without the weeds, more beautfiul flowers would grow. Some new flowers will be allowed to grow -- many of which the garden has never seen before. A couple of the biggest flowers decided that the garden would indeed be a nicer place for all, and so they began a campaign of removing all the weeds.  Iraq is the first weed. It's the easiest one to go after because: (a) there is existing precendents in place (10 UN resolutions for instance), and (b) Iraq was weakened 12 years ago, so the risk of a long, drawn-out, bloddy war is low. There is talk of other weeds being next: Syria, Iran, North Korea. I don't think they'll go after North Korea for a while, though, simply because North Korea doesn't align itself with very many terrorists. Islamic countries, sadly, are more urgent targets because of the terrorist factor.  Anyways, that's my view on why the U.S. is at war. They're going to clean up the garden.

      Hell.  Or should I say, Microsoft Hell for Windows, version XP.  I am currently trying to finish my latest book. I am days away from being done. This last chapter has been quite a tough one to complete.  My deadline was Monday. As of Sunday, I was still only half way through writing the damn thing, so I made the ultimate decision... I was going to stay up until it was done. I spent all day Sunday, all night Sunday night, all the way until Monday morning writing. And it was good. And all was well with the world. I was going to be done shortly -- I had about two hours of work left to go.  And then, the power went out.  No panic from me of course. I was more worried about "how long is this going to take" than anything. I actually took a little nap waiting for it to come back on.  It turns out, I should have been more worried. I lost about three hours work. But wait, you say. Didn't you have "AutoRecover" turned on in Word? Well, yes, I reply. I had it set to AutoSave every 4 minutes. The most I SHOULD have lost was 4 minutes. But I lost three hours. I could not convince MS Word to open the AutoRecover backup any way I tried. And I tried every way there was. Word would actually HANG each time it tried to open the file. So my backup must have been corrupt.  Well, moral of the story... even with AutoRecover. Save often. Ctrl-S is your friend. And as of midnight tonight, I'm still not done writing. I gave up trying to recover the file after a couple of hours, decided to head to work where I was AWOL today, went to dinner, had a long nap, and I'm just getting back into the grove now.

      Geez. Who would have guessed when I woke up this morning that I would be blogging like a mad man today. Five entries and counting.  First, I subscribed to Blogger Pro. I don't know what prompted me to do that, except I liked some of the promised features  -- RSS feed particularly. It turns out there are a ton of other features. I've been posting my entries by email lately. My blog entries now have titles.  You may notice that I then changed the style for the site. No particular reason, although I like this compact yet imfortative style.  I then downloaded SharpReader and got hooked on other people's blogs.  I then learned about a blog search engine called  urlLink Feedster . Cool. I added my RSS feed to their database.  I'm motoring along.

      I ordered a pizza today, and was cheerfully told I would get it in 40 minutes or it would be free. 99 times out of 100, I get my pizza within 40 minutes. No problem.  Today, the pizza took 44 minutes. So I told the pizza driver, "Hey, sorry guy, but you're late." Needless to say, he was very disappointed. "But I was stuck in the snow. I had to get people to help get my car going again." I think he was hoping that I wouldn't notice and just pay, like 50% of people probably do when their pizza is late.  So my question is, do drivers have to pay for late pizzas? Was I taking $15 out of this guy's pocket? I'm slightly regretting my decision to enforce their guarantee. But then the cynic in me thinks, maybe he was just running late and his "stuck in the snow" story is just a lie he came up with. Maybe he  knew  he was late, and this was the best story he could come up with. I don't feel that bad, and my pizza is a bit cold actually.

      As a followup to yesterday's post, I took a few snapshots from the trailer:  This first shot is an example of image manipulation in films. I added a couple of red asterisks to this photo to help make my point.     The building on the left is the CFMT television station headquarters. In the center, towards the back, is a school. Way to the back is Toronto City Center Airport (TCCA). The building on the right (with the red asterisks) is fake. Those buildings aren't there in real life. In real life, there is a street (Bathurst Street) and a gas station (Esso) on that spot. I guess the movie company didn't want to insert a free plug for Esso, so they added a building into the scene. By the way, I recognize that building they inserted -- 600 Queens Quay West. In real life, it is off camera to the left of the scene.  What's odd is, this scene (and the next two) never appeared in the real movie - just the trailer. Yes, Chow Yun Fat does some spectacular helicopter leaps, but you never get to see any "background" in them. (I noticed that there are a few other scenes in the trailer that never made it into the movie, probably having to do with backstory.)     Just off camera to the right of this shot, is the City Centre driving range and golf course. What you see in this photo is a pit mine, train tracks (Go and Via) and the west end of Front Street (where the cars are). The yellow building is a surplus store. To the left of that is a Harley Davidson dealership, and to the left of that is a Lambourghini dealership. The only Lambourghini dealer in Canada. He sells 12 cars a year, what a job!     Here, off to the left of this shot, we see the building that was inserted into the first shot. Either Toronto architects aren't very original, placing two identical buildings on the same street, or the movie makers thought you wouldn't notice the same building in two spots. By the way, I live just one building left off camera. Damn, almost made it into the film.     I remember the day they filmed this.     In the background, you can see Scotia Tower (red logo) and Bank of Montreal's First Canadian Place (blue logo). Two big Toronto banks.

      I finally watched the movie Bulletproof Monk. It wasn't that good of a movie -- the plot seemed to be lacking. A former Nazi chasing a Tibetan monk around the world? Come on... you can do better than that! The only two reasons I wanted to see it at all were:    I like  urlLink Chow-Yun Fat  as an actor (the Corruptor, the Replacement Killers, and Crouching Tiger)   The movie was partially filmed across the street from where I live    I remember one weekend last summer, I looked out my window and saw two helicopters hovering over the abandoned building across the street. One seemed to be firing thousands of rounds of ammunition, while the other was filming it. It took me all of 2 seconds to realize it was a movie being filmed, although I wonder how many people called 911 to report what they saw. I also saw them film the "satellite dish falling off the building" scene. That building has no satellite dishes, so the ones you see in the movie were put there just for filming.  Anyways, you can see most of my neighbourhood (the driving range at least) in the background during the helicopter scene. Even the movie's  urlLink trailer  has a nice glimpse of it. I'd buy the DVD just in the odd chance that my condo makes a cameo appearance in one or two frames. I also recognize other parts of Toronto, such as the Yonge-Bloor subway station (where the little girl's falls on the subway tracks), the some of the bank towers (TD and Scotia), the Toronto skyline, etc.  Scott

      I am really starting to love reading other people's blogs. I can sit there all day listening to the words of wisdom coming in from the ether...  I just read a very interesting first-hand account of how application testing is performed at Microsoft. Thanks to the  urlLink ScottGu  blog. Scott is (and I could be wrong about this) Microsoft's development manager in charge of Visual Studio .NET and ASP .NET.     A tester -- sitting in their office -- can configure the operating system and hardware they want to use (for example: Windows Server 2000, Advanced Server Edition on a 2 processor hardware configuration with a German language build) as well as the test suite they want to run (for example: all session state tests).  The automation framework with then find a hardware machine that meets the specification selected, reformat and re-image the operating system for the choice selected, and then execute the test suite run.  All pass/fail results can then be viewed by the tester on their own machine with their office (fairly fancy -- we are quite proud of this testing framework).    Wow. A tester presses a magic button, and the testing system will find a server that matches the hardware specs they require. Then the chosen server reimages itself to match the operating system and language of the tester has choosen. Wow. And did I say, wow. Or, and can I please add a drool.  I would love to work for Microsoft in Redmond. If anyone is out there, I would move out there in a heartbeat.

What happened to all these 100-page reports, where is that Dick Cheney report? Why is every single issue treated like they have never thought it would come up? What's with the juggling of people and ideas about how to form that "interim government"? Why does it feel like they are using the [lets-try-this-lets-try-that] strategy? Trial and error on a whole country?     That's an interesting perspective from someone living inside the country.     Can anyone tell me what the return of children to schools really means? ... I mean there are a million more pressing issues for these committees meeting daily than getting children back to unsafe schools.    He's paying $5 an hour for Internet access.

They know it's recent, because the voice on the tape thanks the Iraqis who were out on the street celebrating his birthday a couple of weeks ago.  * Apparently, Uday Hussein withdrew $1 billion in cash from the Iraqi central bank just days before the start of the war. Bank employees thought that was odd, since normally he just withdraws "small amounts... like $5 million". Ah yes, apparently in Iraq, $5 million is considered a small bank withdrawl.

Well, how does SARS impact Beijing holding the games? That is, if the disease continues to be a problem, will they have to move the Olympics to somewhere else?  And will Toronto not be chosen as the alternative destination because of its relationship with SARS?

I didn't make any this year, but I want to make a couple now.   1) My life has been consumed by (a) working during the day and (b) writing books on nights and weekends. The unfortunate casualty of this has been my free time. I still make time (regardless of whatever deadlines I may have) for my wife, but I need to make time for myself. I have a pile of books on my bookshelf that remain unread. I still buy books (mainly from Amazon.ca), but I can't read them. And I have a pile of movies on my hard drive that need to be watched. This will free several gigabytes of space once I watch them and delete them.  2) I had a year of steady work to concentrate on picking up a new skill, like J2EE or .NET. But have I made use of that time? No, not really. Note to self, your skills is what puts food in your stomach. Don't neglect them.  Scott

      There's a guy in New Zealand who is attempting to  urlLink build his own cruise missile  for under $5,000, just to prove he can do it.  And you know what, I bet he can do it. That's a scary thought.  I did find it funny that one of his objectives was that he had to be able to build it in his garage without his neighbours knowing. How would you like to be this guy's neighbour?

      I'm relatively new to the blogging world. I've been doing this off and on for nine months, although I've only been making regular contributions to this site in the last two or three months. I met someone for the first time today, and they started the conversation by saying, "So I had a chance to stop by your web site...".  I was momentarily worried about it. What did he see there? Did they see my main site ( urlLink mydemos.com ) or did they see this one? Did they read some of the opinions posted to this site? Did they agree or disagree with some of them?   And that, I suppose is one of the implications of blogging. Every day, people are reading what I say here and making prejudgements about me. Normally, in the Internet world, prejudgements are fine. But when you're meeting someone in the real world for the first time, and that person already knows quite a bit about you from the Internet, that's quite scary. This is a one way medium, after all. It's like a bathroom wall in some respects. There is no opportunity for me to explain things or rephrase things if someone misunderstands me. If I am opposed to something one month, and in favor of it the next, which opinion will this person see? Will I say something offensive?  Moral of the story: I have to watch what I say here. Sadly, I also may have to go back and remove comments that turned out to be rash or ill-advised. After all, this blog is a reflection of who am I. I don't mind people knowing a bit about me from this blog, but I don't want to give the wrong impression either.  Best regards, Scott

      Microsoft has another legal victory under its belt. Sun Microsystems has been suing them to force them to incorporate Java in Windows. On appeal, Microsoft has had Sun's initial victory overturned.   Is anyone ever going to develop for Java on the client ever again? I don't think so.

       Simon Song  has an interesting perspective on life. He just came to New York from China, and works as an intern photographer at the New York Daily News. His press pass gives him behiond-the-scenes access to some of the top celebrities and political figures of our times, yet he's surprised that people read books on the subway.  Keep up the good work Simon.

      I've been a bit out of it this week. First, I started a new job on Monday. It took a few days to orient myself. It's quite unlike any place I've worked at. Essentially, I'm working at a small company (50 employees total), with only one full-time IT guy. They've brought a couple of consultants in (myself and another) to design and develop the system that runs their business. So far, it's not a lot of fun but it is interesting. I am looking forward to facing and defeating the challenges that are coming up, and there appear to be many.  Also, I had the double-whammy of being hit with allergies and a cold at the same time. I came home from work a couple of hours early Friday, and slept for four hours. Zonk! I'm better. It must have been a 24-hour cold that's going around. Or maybe it was SARS - we'll never know.  Of course, my wife kept feeling my forehead for a fever every 20 minutes while I was asleep. SARS has got her scared, since we are living in what appears to be one of the main outbreak cities. "It's not SARS, honey."

      From  urlLink The Independent, UK :   This week the Pentagon announced that 183 US military personnel had been killed since the war began. Of those, 45 have been killed since President George Bush declared the war in Iraq over on 1 May. Earlier this week, the Associated Press said its inquiries had established that at least 3,240 Iraqi civilians were killed in one month, between 20 March and 20 April.   One-quarter of all U.S. military deaths have occurred after the end of the war. Wow. I haven't been paying close enough attention to the newspapers obviously.

      I find it impossible to sleep in these days. I'm the type of person who stays up until 4am if he doesn't have to wake up the next day, and there have been a few days lately (like today) where I have no early appointments and I can sleep in.  The only problem is, the phone rings at 9:00am. That, in and of itself would not be a problem, because I can answer the phone and usually fall back asleep. But then the phone rings again at 10:00am, and after that, I'm up for good. So 6 hours of sleep will have to do today.

Tons of CDs - 60-day trials, beta, etc. Oh, and I learned a bit about VS .NET and met a few people.

      I'm getting tired of that term by the way. ABC weapons (Atomic Biological Chemical) is worse.

I don't normally epouse the left of center views, and I'll punch you if you associate me with the green party. But this article is dead on why many people (both pro- and anti-war) are questioning whether they were misled.  Some are calling this scandal on a level not seen since Watergate. "What did the President know, and when did he know it?"

      I saw the second Matrix movie this afternoon.  On it's surface, this was a really slick film. The Matrix SFX crew really outdid themselves with the fight sequences in this one. I found myself saying "Wow..." several times as I watched it in the theater.  On the other hand, I had a bit of trouble following the story. Some of this may have been intentional, as they already know there is going to be a third installment which will explain everything. I found myself saying "Huh? What did he say?" a couple of times. I might just have to get the DVD just so I can replay a few scenes, pause them, and think about what happened. In "real time", things happened much too quickly for my slowing brain to comprehend.  I don't want to give the movie away of course. And if you've seen Martix 1, you have to see this one. It's definitely worth the $10 matinee price of admission. Although I'll have to wait until November (Matrix 3) to fully get my money's worth...  Scott

      American Airlines was quick to send me an email to apologize, and promised to send me a coupon for my next trip. When the mail comes next week, we'll see how much my four hour ordeal was worth. I'm not expecting much, but it was nice of American to respond so quickly. It didn't seem like a form letter either, since some of the email directly addressed my complaint.    "Please accept my apology for the difficulties you and your wife encountered when you traveled with us."

      I had one of the worst airline experiences of my life yesterday. I guess in the grand scheme of things, it could have been much worse. But when you're in the midst of a bad experience with an airline, one bad experience is as bad as another.  Basically, the latter half of my flight was delayed  four hours  for no good reason as far as I can determine. What's makes the problem several orders of magnitude worse, is that I was actually sitting on the damn plane for those four hours. I've written to American Airlines to get some sort of an apology. We'll see if they respond.  My flight to Aruba was slightly delayed as well. Basically, someone in business class found some suspicious papers in their seat pocket. The plane was delayed an hour while airline security determined if it was a threat or not. Apparently, some diplomat accidentally left some important documents. They probably weren't even threatening documents, just something with a U.S. goverment "top secret" seal on them. Geez.

       urlLink Sydney Morning Herald : "...an average of 13 attacks had been launched each day against occupation forces during the past 45 days, totalling roughly 585...  The commanders believe that the spectre of the deposed leader and his two sons is fuelling the growing resistance to the American occupation."  So the U.S. believes that the reason they are under attack (500+ attacks so far) is that Iraqis still fear Saddam Hussein. If Hussein were dead, they figure, their job would be easier.   Why isn't anyone suggesting that the reason why they are under attack is that they  are not wanted  there? That would seem to be a more logical explanation. Things are worse in Iraq, not better, since the war started. As well, American troops have been heavy handed with the average citizenry (house to house searches, hands above your head, on your knees, blindfolds, etc.).  Don't get me wrong. If I was a U.S. soldier in Iraq, I wouldn't trust anybody. If you let your guard down, a six your old child can throw a grenade at you. But if I was a resident of Iraq, I would hate to have troops pushing "innocent" people around. Or pointing guns at me on a regular basis. Or opening fire in a crowded market. Or just making me feel like a piece of dirt in my own country, while the leaders of the troops sleep in Saddam's old palaces...

      10 U.S. soldiers were injured in Iraq today in three separate attacks, a day after George Bush dared Iraqis to "bring it on"...  Canada.com sums up one point of view in their story, aptly titled:  urlLink   'Bring them on,' Bush says; Iraqis do   .   The most daring of yesterday's attacks took place just before 10 a.m. in Baghdad when a man on foot fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a three-vehicle military convoy moving down Haifa Street, a busy thoroughfare in the centre of the city. One Humvee was struck, wounding three soldiers, witnesses and a military spokesman said.  Witnesses said soldiers in one of the other vehicles opened fire indiscriminately, seriously wounding, and possibly killing, at least one Iraqi driver nearby. Blood pooled next to the slain driver's blue Volkswagen Passat soon after the attack.  A crowd of people gathered around the destroyed Humvee and looted it, taking whatever they could remove. Children and adults climbed on top, stomping on it and chanting, "God bless Mohammad!"  Then someone set the vehicle on fire and the crowd backed away, watching it slowly burn. Children hurled rocks at the blaze and, in a particularly Arab insult, threw shoes at it.   Of course, the guy who fired the grenade disappeared into the crowd and could not be found.

The nonpartisan agency said the annual budget shortfalls will total nearly $1.4 trillion over the next decade, compared with a $5.6 trillion surplus the CBO forecast in 2001.    $1.4 trillion is a lot of money.

      From the  urlLink Business Report :   The White House last month forecast that the federal budget deficit would explode to a record $455 billion in 2003, and then to $475 billion next year.  President George W Bush's administration said the deficit, which is 50 percent bigger than that projected just five months ago, had been exacerbated by a weak economy, the Iraq war and a $350 billion tax cut package.   The U.S. annual deficit is now $1,350 for each man, woman and child in the United States. That's how much money the government has to borrow each year just to run its day-to-day business.  The U.S.  urlLink federal debt  is now $6,735,127,561,642.54. Holy crap - that's a lot of commas. That's $19,243 for each man, woman and child.

      This is  urlLink a nice article . In many ways, it tempts me -- you can certainly earn more having 15-20 clients than just having one. And you are less likely to be affected when your contract doesn't get renewed, as has happened to me twice recently.  But there are down sides too. Like, how would you ever be able to take a month off with 20 clients? What about calls at 8am, and 8pm? I'd need to set ground rules up front.  I'm not too keen on giving phone and email support for free, although I think it's very difficult to charge accurately for it. Still have to think about that one....

I would think girls would not be a problem for such a man. -- And if I had $545,000, I would not leave it in my car at 2:30am in a seedy part of town -- In fact, what the hell does anyone need to be walking around with that much cash? In case he wants to buy a house as an impulse purchase? -- What kind of thief breaks into a car, and then throws away $500,000 in cash that he finds there?

      I wonder if we can coax  urlLink Ken Starr  to come out of retirement for one more investigation?  The FBI  urlLink announced today  that it's launched a full-scale investigation into the leak of a CIA agents name that originated from the White House. On CNN last night, one interviewee said that this White House source had called "several" reporters to blow the agent's cover. Only snakey Robert Novak had the stupidity to write about it.  There seems to be a general defence of Robert Novak's actions in the media these days, as if he played no part in this alleged crime. I say, if a crime has been committed, he played as big a part as the person who leaked the information. I mean, he knowingly blew an agent's cover in a national newspaper, putting unknown lives at risk. (Yes, the agent herself is not a field agent, but she may have had roles gathering information, or acting as a go-between, in other ways.)  This is going to get worse before it gets better for President Bush:   The focus on Rove brought an odd twist to Bush's travels. When the president boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington, he walked up the steps and waved -- and not a single camera followed. He looked momentarily perplexed. All lenses were trained on Rove at the bottom of the steps.

       I'm going to have to start reading Russel Beattie more .  We've probably all seen these cool digital picture frames, where you can load a bunch of pictures on a CompactFlash card, and the frame will display them one-by-one.  But Nokia is announcing a digital frame that can be updated by infrared, from a phone. And, sometime soon, there will be one that can be updated by MMS (text messaging). So you get one of these camera phones, and then you can instantly send the photo to a picture frame halfway across the world!   Can you imagine, taking pictures (using your cell phone) while on your trip to the Grand Canyon, and instantly sending them to a picture frame located 3000 miles away at your parent's house? In real time? Wow!   Update 12:30PM:  Russell covers the mobile market well, and is interesting to read. But he doesn't want people like me reading his site, so I will stop.

       urlLink Russell Beattie , famous Microsoft-hater, is forced to admit that Microsoft typically gains strong market share in most markets because the competitors are asleep. He has the following to say about Microsoft's latest operating system for mobile phones:   The most important thing to remember is that the Windows Mobile OS does *not suck*. ... [W]hen it comes to developing full-fledged mobile enterprise applications that are used daily, Mobile Java just doesn't cut it right now. ... Microsoft will show up with a good looking phone, that's easy to develop on, with great deals from the carriers backed with millions in marketing dollars aimed at consumers and corps alike, and a massive army of developers backing them and the rest of the industry will cry foul as they get tromped on yet again by the borg.    So when Microsoft Windows Mobile powers the majority of cell phones in the future, no one will be able to cry anti-trust. They did it by being relentless. While Palm, Sun Java J2ME, and Symbian are sleeping, Microsoft is running full-speed in this market.

      According to  urlLink news.com , the United States is set to sharply reduce the number of H1-B (foreign worker) visas, from 195,000 to 65,000 per year.  This is good, I suppose, for all those out-of-work American tech workers. This means that 130,000 foreign workers (from India, China, and other places) will have to go home at the end of the year, and those jobs need to be filled. It might also be good for us Canadian workers, as we can easily get a NAFTA visa to work in the U.S. (and there is no limit on those).

      I just discovered  urlLink this site  while looking for the lyrics to " urlLink What's Luv ?". It's hilarious. This person takes the lyrics to popular hit songs, and translates it into proper English so we can see how ridiculus they are.  An example:   I wanna chick with thick hips That licks her lips She can be the office type or like to strip Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high   The author translates the above to the following:   I am sexually attracted to a woman with a curvaceous figure Who moistens her lips with her tongue Conservative or skanky-I don't discriminate Lady, when you gaze into my eyes I get very excited But once you open your mouth, it's all over    Cool. They have done this to several other songs.

But knowing what the lyrics are supposed to be, I couldn't believe the words they were blanking out. The song was "What's Luv?" By Fat Joe, Ashanti and Ja Rule.  I've highlighted just a few of the censored lyrics above.  Who gets to decide what words get blanked out? OK, from the above it appears that any words that have a direct or indirect reference to drugs get blanked (high, E). And any oblique reference to sex as well (menage)? I mean, are these the words we are trying to protect our kids from hearing? I understand the purpose, but in reality it will have no effect. It just ruins a song for no good reason.

      I need a system reboot. No --- not my computer. Me. My brain needs a rest.  What I'm talking about is a month with  no stress . A month where I can sleep in until any time that I want. Or a month where my wife and I can go on a driving vacation of the United States and Canada, and not worry about what time it is.  It's not that I've never had a vacation. I've had plenty. My last vacation (to Aruba) was in May. (Only four months ago, but it feels like an eternity.) The problem with that vacation was it was only 4 days, which was not enough time to relax.  My previous vacation, a year ago, was also only 4 days. Short vacations are nice, but they don't provide any real respite.  The only time I've had long vacations, I had long journeys to go with it. The occassional two or three weeks in the Philippines. But again, no respite.  And it's not that I have never been unemployed. I was off a month between my last contract and this one. But it was a month where I was working hard -- finding and interviewing for jobs, writing a book, working on side-projects for  urlLink xguru.com  clients. It was no vacation.  Before that, I was off for 8 months in 2001/2002. I guess that qualifies as time off, even though I was writing another book, and working on other xguru projects.   Anyways, it looks like I won't be able to have time off for a while. Not even a week. The project I'm working on now is under a tight deadline, and every week it just gets tighter.   Perhaps after this contract I won't look right away for the next one... What's the worst that can happen? I would be willing to sacrafice a few months of earning money in exchange for some better emotional and physical health.

       urlLink Jay Currie  has raised posibility that copying music is legal in Canada.  I knew that copying music for personal use was, at one time, legal in the United States. The DMCA might have changed that. But I never knew it was legal in Canada. Canadian law actually states "copying of sound recordings of musical works onto audio recording media for the private use of the person who makes the copy" is permitted.   Hey, I copy sound recordings for private use all the time! Yay for me!  One reason it is legal is that we pay a hefty tax on blank audio cassettes and CDs which go towards artists.  $70 Million collected to date.

      The Toronto Star had an  urlLink interesting article  today about the so-called revolution happening in American politics. I don't agree with everything the writer says, but it's interesting to hear a point of view that has been stifled for so long...  Of course, it helps that the writer starts the article off with some interesting figures:   On Friday, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their 2004 federal budget deficit forecast to $525 billion (up from $475 billion), and set their 10-year cumulative deficit target at $5.5 trillion (up from $4.5 trillion).   In 2001, the CBO projected a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years. Now, it looks like a $5.5 trillion deficit over that same period. Why isn't anyone asking where $11.1 trillion went? The money has to flow into somebody's pockets... whose?   You can't just say "defense". That's a cop out. The 150,000 soldiers in Iraq are not earning $7.4 million per year each. So the $1.1 trillion a year isn't all going for salaries. So when the government says they're going to increase defense spending, what they really mean to say is they're going to pay billions of dollars to American defense contractors for new equipment. That isn't a bad thing necessarily, but let's be honest and say exactly where the money is going.

      In one month, from August 7, 2003 to September 9, 2003, the U.S. debt has risen $75,672,814,370.14. That's $75.6 Billion. That's a lot of money. And think of it, that's not what the U.S. government SPENDS in a month, it's what they BORROW in a month. What could I do with $75.6 billion?  Well, for one, I would be the richest person in the world, more than doubling the wealth of Bill Gates who only has $33.4 billion.  I could purchase PepsiCo, who's current market value is $66.2 billion.  I could give every man, woman and child in the United States $259.11.  I could give every man, woman and child in the World $11.99 (which is a lot of money in some countries).  I could purchase 44 space shuttles (at $1.7 billion a piece).  And that's just with one month's worth of the U.S. government debt.

      Seven months ago, in  urlLink this myrandommusings post , I suggested that the price of music has to drop in order for the record business to survive. The price of a CD had gotten so far away from the cost of actually producing the music, that in effect the music companies were gouging the consumer. (I am not so naive to believe that the artist sees anywhere near a few pennies of the $19 cost of a CD.)  Well today,  urlLink it was announced  at least one major record company will start charging 30% less for the cost of CDs. (They are also dropping the cost of tapes.) This addresses half of my proposed solution.  The other half was that they had to start becoming more flexible with downloadable music. People, particularly young people, want that option. Music companies need to give them a legal way to do that. It looks like progress is definitely being made on that front, with successful services such as iTunes.  I love it when I'm right. Notice I didn't say anything back then about suing consumers, although deterring the bad behavior certainly helps steer potential customers to the legal methods. It looks like they're turning this thing around.

      The  urlLink New York Times  today has one of the most convincing articles I've read recently on the real motivations of both the U.S. government occupying Iraq, and the Iraqi suicide bombers who are still fighting back.   The people who mounted the attacks on the Red Cross are not the Iraqi Vietcong. They are the Iraqi Khmer Rouge - a murderous band of Saddam loyalists and Al Qaeda nihilists, who are not killing us so Iraqis can rule themselves. They are killing us so they can rule Iraqis.  Have you noticed that these bombers never say what their political agenda is or whom they represent? They don't want Iraqis to know who they really are. A vast majority of Iraqis would reject them, because these bombers either want to restore Baathism or install bin Ladenism.

      I stumbled across an article today that attempted to justify the high cost of life-saving medicines. ( urlLink Price controls can be lethal - The Washington Times )  "The Canadian government requires that pharmaceutical companies sell drugs to them at very low cost, under the threat of taking away patent protection. The Canadians do not pay their full share of R&D costs - they are in effect parasites."   In the article, the author asserts that price controls discourage innovation, which (in the long term) will lead to needless deaths. Of course, high prices lead to needless deaths in the short term, but the author prefers to claim the opposite.  Let's look at price controls using an example. Let's assume it costs $100 million dollars to discover a new drug and get it through FDA approval. How much profit does the drug company "deserve" on this amazing discovery?   In the investment world, 10% a year is considered a good rate of return. But let's be generous and give the drug companies a 30% rate of return. That's $30 million profit a year, for 20 years (until the patent runs out). $600 million total.  But patents work both ways -- they protect an investment in research, but also give you the right to charge as much as you want. What if you calculated the drug company was earning $100 million per year on that one drug? Or $500 million per year? Or $1 billion per year? Is that a fair rate of return - 100%, 500%, 1000%?  I believe governments have a responsibility to ensure both parties (the drug companies and the patients) are treated fairly in the marketplace. Yes, drug companies should make a reasonable rate of return, considering the financial risk they must take in research and development for drugs that may not work out. But patients also need to be protected, so that a legal monopolist is not allowed to gouge the consumers just because they are the only cure in town.  I once had a dream that I had discovered a cure for cancer. In my dream, I charged $1 million per patient to cure the disease, and earned $100 billion in one year. Only once the millionaires were cured, would I lower the price so that the middle classes could afford to be treated. Not that I wouldn't deserve a healthy reward for discovering a cure for cancer, but in real life, I hope the government would step in and force me to charge a reasonable price (say, $10,000) so that more lives can be spared.

Amazon would only look in the book's title for those words, and your results would be poor.  Now you search for that phrase, and you get 37 hits. Why? Because you get ANY book with the words "queen's quay" and "toronto" in them. Wow!

      I recently read this in an  urlLink online article :   The high "energy density" of junk food -- the amount of calories it contains in relation to its weight -- throws the brain's appetite control system into confusion, as this is based on the size of a portion rather than its energy content.   I tend to disagree with the basic principle -- that appetite is based on the volume of food you eat, regardless of the type of food. The size of the meal obviously has  something  to do with making you feel full -- after all, if they packed 1,000 calories into a single pill, we would still feel hungry. But there is definitely more to it.  I know with me, there are certain types of food that fill me up rather quickly. For instance, eating a 12 ounce steak is enough to keep me full all night. Eating too much bread before dinner often means I am unable to finish the steak.  On the other hand, I can polish off an entire box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese for dinner as well. A box of cooked Mac'N'Cheese is 10 times the volume of a cooked steak. So why does my body treat them the same?  Also certain types of foods make me hungrier - for instance, when I eat salty chips or peanuts, I have to really stop myself from eating too many. Are you telling me that I will feel full after eating the same quantity of peanuts, Mac'N'Cheese and steak? It's not true in my case.

According to McMahon, the crash was related to 'health problems and medication' -- reportedly for a blood pressure problem."  If this holds true, that the cause of the ferry accident was that the captain collapsed because of a medical condition, then the New York ferry system has to take some of the blame in not preventing this.  One way it could have been prevented would be to have two "captains" at the helm, so that if one gets ill suddenly, the other can take over in an instant. Another would be to monitor the health of the captains on a frequent basis (say, a full-physical monthly), and remove any that show signs of poor health such as high blood pressure.

       Ay yai yai.  The World is facing an interesting dilemma with Iraq. How should it react to the United States' request for help with the occupation?   On the one side, you have the United States and Britain, who felt that invading Iraq was clearly in the best interests of long-term world peace. On the other side, there is the Rest of the World, who felt that launching a preemptive strike against a country who had done nothing recent to deserve it was the wrong thing to do, and not in the interests of world peace.  Both sides felt personally offended that the other did not support them on this important issue.  I can see both sides. And I'm personally torn (as I've written here many times).  Perhaps it's easier to think about the issue if we use an analogy....  Let's say you have a friend who wants to quit his terrible job and start an online casino. You tell him that there is no money in online casinos, but he doesn't listen to you. He quits his job the next day. A few months later, he is dead broke. He gets evicted from his apartment for not paying his rent, has to sell his car, and has no money even for food. He wants to come live with you (rent free), eat your food and borrow your car. What do you do?  On the one had, he brought this problem on himself. He didn't listen to you, and now he needs your help. To top it off, he's not even sorry for doing it, and it doesn't appear he's learnt any lesson from it. He was a bit of a jerk to you earlier, when you didn't support him quitting his job, and he has never apologized for it. In fact, he's still insisting online casinos are a great business to be in. You're seriously tempted to let him be homeless for a little while to teach him a lesson.  On the other hand, he's your friend. It's a bit cruel to let him suffer like that. You have room in your house, you have a good job and can support him for a little while without hurting yourself. This is your chance to act like a responsible adult, instead of getting your revenge as if you were in Grade 6.  So what's the problem here? You feel a bit upset that your friend was reckless, made his life a mess, and is now making your life a mess as well. Your friend is a bit upset that you weren't there for him a few months ago, and still aren't there for him. What happened to friends being there for each other no matter what the circumstances?  So, there it is. You have either got to step up and support your friend in his time of need, or that could be the end of the friendship. OR, does your friend need to swallow his pride and admit his mistake? Either scenario would solve the problem, but neither friend wants to be the one to make all the concessions.   In the rift between the U.S. and Europe, the end of the friendship could mean renewed tensions and hostilities for other matters. And nobody wants that.

      I don't have to tell you that recently Arnold Schwarzenegger got elected governor of California, kicking the previous governor out on his butt not even 1 year after the last election. However, some people have already speculated that, a year from now when the honeymoon period is over, Gov. Terminator might also be kicked out in a recall as well.   So, the question arises... do recalls help democracy, or hurt it?   As with anything, there are two ways to look at it. On the pro-recall side, if a politician betrays the people's trust and becomes wildly unpopular, why should he be allowed to stay in office for three more years before the next election? It seems to me that the prudent thing to do is remove the incompetent politician before he screws things up beyond repair.  But one of the benefits of having elections every 4 years (as opposed to every year, or every 3 months) is that a politician has a chance to "do the right thing" every once and a while, regardless of whether it's the most popular option. For instance, when seat belts were first made mandatory, I imagine it was an unpopular decision. But in hindsight, it was the right decision.  There are some things that are never popular and some that are always popular. For instance, raising taxes (no matter how insignificant or for what purpose) will largely be unpopular. Or cutting spending on police will usually be unpopular. But here's the thing: sometimes unpopular things must be done. Now who's going to do them? Who will be the one to raise taxes when the city/state/country is facing a dire budget situation? Who will be the one to cut military or police spending, even if there is a lot of wasted money in those departments?   Having frequent recall votes forces a politician to worry more about popularity and less about doing the right thing. Many times, the right thing is the popular thing. But sometimes, its not...

      It seems to me, that if Major League Baseball wanted to make the game more exciting, they should shorten the regular season and legthen the playoffs. I mean, 162 games is way too many, such that any one game of the regular season has almost no importance. In contrast, the playoffs are too short. Not enough teams get to make the playoffs.  Compare that to football. There are 16 games in the NFL regular season. Each game is vitally important, and if you get a team that loses 4 games in a row, it makes it really difficult to make it into the playoffs.  Look at the baseball playoffs for instance. The Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees series is very exciting. People are talking about it. Same with Cubs and Marlins. Ratings galore. This is where baseball makes it money - tickets, television, merchandise...   So if they shortened the season by 1 month (or 2 even), and allowed more teams to make the playoffs, baseball could reduce its expenses and raise its income. It's dollars and cents.

       urlLink Last year , I made a top 10 list of things I'd like to buy. Surprisingly, I managing to knock a few items off the list in the past few months... Namely, I have a flat-panel LCD monitor at home, I purchased a digital camera, I have a wireless network, and I took a carribean vacation this year. So you see, the top three items have been taken care of.   Here's my new list. I have some money burning a hole in my pocket, so I should be able to take care of some of these soon.  1)   urlLink Tablet PC   - I couldn't convince myself in 2003 that I needed a third computer (besides my home desktop and existing laptop). I met someone the other day that had four computers at home. I don't know why... Perhaps Santa will bring me a new laptop this Christmas. I have my eye on the tablet PC's, which have a really cool form factor.  2)  DVDs  - I'll pick up Matrix Reloaded, LOTR: The Two Towers Special Extended Edition, and Terminator 3... Only problem is figuring out when I'll have time to watch them all.  3)  USB Flash Drive  - 128 MB on a keychain. Cool.  4)   urlLink TiVo   - I so want to try one of these digital recorders. I mean, the ability to record without having to fumble with VCR cassettes, or accidentally tape over something important... Pause live programs, instant replays... Why don't these things come to Canada already?  5)  Dual-Monitor Display  - I've read rave reviews from people who use two monitors to work, and it sounds like it would be an increase in productivity. Screen real estate is always going to be a problem with only one monitor (unless you use a 21 inch+ screen I suppose...).  I still want to get a new cell phone, and I'm buying a new car next week. (That doesn't count, does it?) But, for now, that's what my wish list looks like.

      Now, I don't want to start a big controversy, and I like to think of myself as open minded. I was in a local computer store the other day, and they had a small Apple Mac display over in the corner. It's one of these "store within a store" concepts.  First of all, I took a look at a couple of PowerBooks. These are strange looking machines, as their LCD's are the wide-screen version. I go weak in the knees over large plasma television displays, but for some reason the wide laptop displays threw me off. It would take some getting used to I guess. The quality of the displays were gorgeous, however. I don't know if the Mac can display more colors than a typical Windows box, but these PowerBooks were certainly configured with some vibrant desktop wallpaper. The colors really stood out.  I saw some iBooks, and they really looked cheap. White plastic? Ugh. I guess if you're carrying an iBook around you stand out in a crowd, whereas all Windows laptops look alike. But still, didn't find much about the iBooks I liked visually.  Finally, I checked out the G5 display. Again, huge wide screen cinema display. The one button mouse felt odd in my hand, like I was missing a valuable shortcut. I am so used to right-clicking to bring up a popup menu I can't imagine a UI without one.   And here's the big relevation for me. I looked at the Mac OS X interface, and I was lost. The desktop was completely clear, only a finder at the bottom and a menu along the top. I didn't know where to click at first. It was almost like entering an empty room. "What now?"  I finally clicked the little IE icon on the finder bar. Cool animation. The IE icon, instead of acting like a Windows button, bounced up and down for a second like a rubber ball. Someone spent a lot of time getting icons to do that. IE opened, and immediately gave me an error message because there was no Internet connection. But the error box was the prettiest thing I had ever seen. The OK button was pulsating, like a liquid orb of some sort. I didn't want to click it, I wanted to watch it pulsate for a little while. Someone spent a lot of time making that button pulsate.  Finally, I went to close IE. The upper minimize, maximize, close titlebar buttons each had their own color. When you moved the mouse over them, they animated. Wow. It reminded me that the Windows titlebar buttons have not changed in more than 10 years since Windows 3.1.  And all this, made me think ... the Mac is not the right computer for me. It's a work of art. Every thing about it has been thoroughly designed, with a great attention to detail. The box it ships in, the outer case of the computer itself, the monitor, every icon, every button and every pixel. The guy selling the computer is dressed in black. People that own Macs tend to love them like a member of their family.  It's a work of art, and art is meant to be watched, not used. I need a work tool. I need to get things done, and I don't care if the cardboard box it came in is brown. I don't care if the computer case is grey. I don't need a wide-screen (movie-theater style) monitor. My buttons do not have to pulsate or animate or anything. That's why the Mac will never gain wide acceptance. They have not sold people on the concept of a computer as a fashion accessory. "Think different", they say? "Just do it", I say.

      One of the questions the insurance agent had asked me was if I had any tickets within the last three years. I responded that, yes, I had received one in February 2001. She corrected me, saying her computer showed a ticket in April 2001. "That's the same one", I said. "You're right, " she responded, "the ticket was in February while the conviction was in April."  If they can get the information from their computer, why do they ask? To trap me in a lie, methinks...

Of course, you can't do a background check exclusively on a car -- you have to be doing it on the driver as well. So I am being investigated by one of the country's most powerful companies AT THIS VERY MOMENT.  I find myself sitting up straighter in my chair, and I am a bit ashamed of my messy office workspace. I hope they can overlook that in deciding if they want to grant me car and home insurance...

      Another source is casting doubt on Robert Novak's flimsy defense, that he was not on the receiving end of an official leak.  Mike Allen of the Washington Post had this to say on  urlLink CNN  the other night:   ALLEN: Yes, in addition to that Ambassador Wilson has said that he thought it was to intimidate others who might come forward. My colleague, Howard Kurtz, today talked to another one of the reporters who was told the name before it was published and their sense was just that the administration official thought that Joe Wilson was getting a big ride in the media and they wanted to sort of cast doubt on his whole investigation, which sort of pulled the plug out of the Niger uranium element.  BROWN: From what you've been able to find out how many reporters were called on this? Was it somebody just picking up the phone book and looking under reporters in the yellow pages and making cold calls?  ALLEN: It seems to be that this was a place where these were officials that had relationships with the reporters. There were some high profile people that were called. There's a variety of reasons. One thing that a lot of journalists started talking about among themselves today is why more people didn't do the story at the time.  But we were told that some people were uncomfortable with it. Some people thought it was a little bit off the point of what was being said about Ambassador Wilson so there were a variety of reasons but this weekend they all came together and no there's a great deal of attention to who talked to whom about this at what point.   So it appears that many reporters got the scoop, and that Novak was the only one to fall for it.

      The  urlLink Washington Post  has been covering this story nicely over the past couple of days:   Plame currently is an analyst at the CIA. But, intelligence officials said, she previously served overseas in a clandestine capacity, which means her name is kept classified to protect her previous contacts and operations, and her ability to work again undercover overseas.    Already, Robert Novak's story is changing:   The controversy began when Novak on July 14 named Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA operative, citing two senior administration officials. In a column today, Novak said "I did not receive a planned leak" and called the information "an offhand revelation." He also wrote that an "unofficial source" at the CIA said Plame "has been an analyst, not in covert operations."   But on July 22, Newsday reported: "Novak, in an interview, said his sources had come to him with the information. 'I didn't dig it out, it was given to me,' he said. 'They thought it was significant, they gave me the name and I used it.' "    As they say, this is starting to get interesting...

      You'd think a Canadian would have no interest in the race for California governor.

"Bustamante's job is to blow a little smoke," he said. "He's back on his heels and on the defensive."  "For Bustamante, this thing has spiraled out of control. The fat lady is on the stage and is just about ready to sing," Schecter added...   So they're comparing Bustamante to the Iraqi Information Minister, during the final days of the war? For some reason, I find the comparison really funny. Really, really funny. Hehe...

       urlLink What the heck is going on here?  Lots of strange things are turning up about the mother of the alleged victim in the Michael Jackson case.  Apparently, her son was briefly shown on the famous documentary made of Jackson's life that aired early this year. Due to the public outcry about Michael claiming he sleeps in the same bed as children, Jackson's people asked the mother to sign an affidavit and make an audio tape saying that things were alright. In February 2003, she did.  In May, according to her husband's lawyer, she still spoke very highly of Jackson, praising him. I bet if you were to ask around, you would find dozens of people who could testify that she praised Jackson often. It seemed like Jackson was the family's saviour -- paying their bills, buying them gifts.   The one day the gravy train ended. The money flow stopped.  Now, the mother says she was confused when she signed the affidavit, and didn't know what she was signing.  In my opinion, her story is starting to fall apart. Three questions arise: * If you didn't know what you were signing, how do you explain the audio tape testimonial? * If you were coerced into providing the testimonial, why were you still praising Jackson in May? * Why did these abuse allegations dating back many months only surface after Jackson stopped giving you money?  By claiming she was confused and/or coerced, she's basically claiming she was aware of the abuse 9 months ago. Given that Jackson paid for her son's medical treatment in the meantime, bought her a car, and paid her rent, one can assume Jackson still got to spend time alone with the child. What kind of mother allows her son to spend time with someone she knows is an abuser.  Basically, the story doesn't make sense. The family is apparently in hiding. For good reason I suppose, otherwise she might have to answer a few questions. Enquiring minds want to know.

       urlLink The Australian  is reporting some interesting details about the mother accusing Michael Jackson of impropriety against her 13-year old son. According to the story, Janet Arvizo once sued J.C. Penny, claiming security guards beat and sexually assaulted her in 1998 when she was caught shoplifting with her kids. J.C. Penny paid $137,500 to settle the suit out of court.   Then during her divorce earlier this year, she accused her husband of spousal abuse and child cruelty. Her former husband of course denies those allegations, and also claims that his ex-wife had gotten their children to lie about that abuse on her behalf.  More recently, her son (who has leukemia) was granted a wish to meet Michael Jackson. Jackson paid the boy's medical bills, bought his mother a car and gave the family a place to live. Earlier this year, Michael informed them that he could no longer financially support the family. Suddenly he's being charged with sexual assualt.  This story will obviously be brought up in court, and could serve to harm the case of the accuser. So even if the charges are true, the fact that this woman had a history of dubious abuse accusations, and was financially reliant on Michael Jackson until just a short time ago, would damage her credibility greatly.  In other words, she has a history of claiming abuse in various situations for financial gain. She gets caught shoplifting, claims abuse, and gets a financial settlement. She gets divorced, claims abuse, and wins custody of the kids. Michael Jackson stops paying her rent? Surprise, surprise -- she claims abuse again. I hope the judge in this case allows these claims to be entered into evidence, as it really does seem relevant to this case.  I'm still not convinced anything happened here. We'll see though.

      Moody's investor service  urlLink has confirmed  a AAA rating on U.S. government debt, it's highest level. At the same time, Moody's said that the U.S. deficit ratio is larger than most of the other governments rated AAA, and it appears the deficit will get worse over the next 4 years before it starts getting better. If nothing is done, the U.S. will be in dire financial straights in 2020 - 16 years from now. That's a long way off I suppose, but not  that  long.  Can you imagine the outcry from U.S. politicians if Moody's downgraded U.S. debt? Holy smokes! The Moody's employees responsible for that report would be charged with treason, and the company would suffer a public humiliation beyond compare. Perhaps Moody's would be accused of supporting terrorists, since it's credit downgrade would cause billions of dollars in damage to the U.S. economy "in a time of war".  Hey, maybe that's what bin Laden has been trying to do all along? Make the U.S. spend (some say waste) trillions of dollars on defense over the next 10 years, forcing the government into either bankruptcy or a much weaker political and economic position worldwide.  That is, the weak U.S. economy cannot be blamed solely on bin Laden and September 11th. George Bush and his warriors played a key role as well.

      This is disturbing. It looks like the DA in the latest Michael Jackson case has a  urlLink personal vendetta to settle  with the superstar. I mean, I'm all for relentless persuit of criminals. But when you look into this DA's history, I bet even an innocent man would not be able to escape his grasp for long.  I hate it when the supposed good guys in a criminal case (D.A., prosecutor, police, judge) are clearly biased in favor of one outcome. Just like the judge in the Microsoft case who gave press interviews before the end of the anti-trust trial basically slamming the company and its practices.   In my mind, a district attorney should say "The evidence clearly points to this person as the perpetrator". Not "I know in my heart this scum-bag did it. I'm just waiting for some solid evidence and then I'm going to nail his ass!" Perhaps I watch too much CSI. Grissom is my hero -- let the evidence tell you what happened.

      The  urlLink Star Tribune  has an interesting editorial on why the U.S. isn't getting very far trying to convince the world that Iran's nuclear program is a threat.   Before the United States went to war [with Iraq], the IAEA had effectively demolished the most serious case for doing so -- Iraq's ongoing effort to build nuclear arms. Postwar American efforts to find nuclear materials have proven the IAEA right and the United States wrong.  So now comes the IAEA saying it has no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program, while the United States asserts that one exists. Who's the world, and the American people for that matter, more likely to believe?   Basically, the U.S. used up their credibility on their prewar claims on Iraq. So even in Iran is a legitimate threat, the burden of proof is on the United States to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

      Last weekend I finally caved and bought a membership to  urlLink Costco .  Man oh man, that place has a lot of stuff. I had been there a couple of times as a guest of my sister-in-law, and I was always intrigued by the size of the place. I never really had a chance to walk around and browse though. Now that I have signed up, I plan to explore the place more thoroughly.  So far, the biggest deals we have found have been on cheese. Yes, I did just say cheese. For instance, my current favourite chesse,  urlLink Mini Babybel , is at least half the price at Costco than it is at Loblaws. Mmm...  Also, my wife found a huge  urlLink wheel of Brie  which was also half the price of the big grocer's. Part of the savings might be the fact that you have to buy more in order to get the savings.

      No matter  urlLink which way you look at it , November has been a terrible month so far for the coalition in Iraq. We're only half way through it, and already it is the deadliest month since March 2003. As of November 17th, we've surpassed the casualty totals for both September and October combined.  There have been  urlLink four   urlLink big   urlLink incidents   urlLink this month .

       urlLink Blogger  has the answer for everything:   Censorship is generally thought of as a negative thing, but this is not always true. You know how faces are sometimes blurred on news programs to protect peoples' privacy? You can go that same route with your blog by searching for potentially incriminating keywords and editing for a softer, more Mom-friendly vocabulary. For example: "I got really drunk last night" becomes, "I got really marshmallow last night." It may not make sense, but it does give you plausible deniability, which could help. Every little bit counts.

       urlLink News: Patent office to re-examine Eolas patent   It looks like there is a good chance the Eolas patent could be revoked. Yipee!  In case you didn't know, a one-man company called Eolas has a patent that covers a "system to access and execute an embedded program object" inside a browser window, which pretty much covers all embedded ActiveX controls and plug-ins (Flash, PDF, and any embedded multimedia like audio and video). They successfully sued Microsoft over the issue, and won a judgement of $521 million (plus $110 million accrued interest).  The whole Internet, including the W3C standards body, pretty much protested the patent, and it looks like it's now being reviewed. I think the patent system has to change. Amazon.com has been granted a number of patents which seem obvious, and I thought patents were supposed to apply to non-obvious things. I can understand patenting a drug... I can't understand patenting "one-click ordering", since it is so obvious.

       urlLink Justices to Hear Case of Detainees at Guantanamo : "Setting the stage for a historic clash between presidential and judicial authority in a time of military conflict, the Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether prisoners at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are entitled to access to civilian courts to challenge their open-ended detention."  This is something that has really bothered me for a while, and I'm glad it's coming to a head. The United States government has, since the attacks on September 11th, consistently trampled over the basic human rights of tens of thousands of people. There were more than 1,000 people held in jail for more than a year after the attacks, without charges, some without access to a lawyer, some without access to their families, and all without access to the evidence... The vast, vast majority have since been released without charges. But how would  you  feel if you were put in jail for 18 months, without being told why? If even you had access to a lawyer, the evidence against you is classified and so you don't even know what you did to end up in jail. I don't suppose the U.S. government apologizes when they release you after all that time...  And what about the people in Guantanamo? Again, they are prisoners of war when the war is supposed to be over. The United States is treating these people (not all of them soldiers) as bad as the American POWs were treated in Vietnam. Isn't (former POW) Senator John McCain upset by this?  Let's not even talk about the prisoners being held inside Iraq and Afghanistan. Or the prisoners being held on board U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. Anyone remember that big #3 Al Qaeda terrorist the U.S. captured six months ago? He's disappeared - never to be seen again I suppose.

      The  urlLink New York Times  has a comment on the recent WTO ruling against the United States steel tarriffs.   "What the world will read into Washington's bipartisan protectionist rant is the unwillingness of a bully to abide by the rules it expects others to follow."   The United States, for years, has been speaking out of both sides of its mouth about free trade. They work hard trying to open up foreign markets for American corporations (there was a great effort to get Kodak film into Japan, a market dominated by Fuji, for instance). But then they pass laws domestically making it harder to other countries to sell goods within the U.S.  The most famous catch-phrase used to describe the U.S. trade policy is an attempt to "create a level playing field". Of course, everyone has their own view of what is level.  The white house says that the main reason for imposing the tarriffs is to give the U.S. steel industry time to reorganize itself to become more competitive. Essentially, American producers of steel have very high per-ton costs when compared to low-wage countries like China, Russia, and Brazil. How are Americans ever going to compete with those countries on price? The answer: they won't.  There are only two solutions, and the U.S. seems unwilling to admit it. The first is to accept the U.S. steel makers produce a more expensive product, and then produce less -- close some steel mills and drastically reduce the size of the industry to a managable level. The other solution is to concentrate on things the Chinese aren't doing -- better quality steel, lighter steel, stronger steel, in more shapes and sizes, better customer service, quicker deliveries... cheaper isn't always better. The American steel companies need to become world leaders again in quality steelmaking.   Instead, they are satisifed with the status quo. The result is higher prices for car makers, and higher prices for cars for you and me. The building trades also have a right to complain.   Maybe the U.S. manufacturers should lobby their congressmen to raise the minimum quality levels of the steel used in car and home production -- after all, there are important public safety issues here. But to have a tarriff just on the basis of price hurts everyone and helps noone. The U.S. steel industry is no better off today than they were two years ago, and they don't seem to be doing any real restructuring or reorganizing.

      In most elections, you have to vote for more than one office. For instance,  urlLink today  I voted for one mayor, one city councillor, and one school board trustee.  This is the first election (that I can remember) where every single person I voted for lost. I couldn't even pick the winning school board trustee. This is why I don't do too well at the casino.

      OK, I finally relented. Cancelled the slow install.  I downloaded the official Windows XP Pro boot disks from Microsoft. Created 6 floppies, and booted with them. Install starts - asking for CD. CD is in the drive. Why can't it find the CD? Argh! The most likely reason is I downloaded the boot disks for Windows XP Pro Service Pack 1, and my CD is the version without the service pack.   I just downloaded the proper (non-service pack) boot disks. Let's try this again.  (By the way, how is it the BOOT DISKS have changed between XP Pro and SP1?)

      Earlier this week, I installed Virtual PC onto my main PC at home. The intention (as described in my  urlLink www.mydemos.com  blog) is to have a separate environment where I can install fresh copies of every cool Microsoft development tool I can get my dirty hands on. My current home PC has had so many installs and uninstalls, that I would prefer to be working in a clean environment.  So I installed Virtual PC (Trial Edition). Two days later,  urlLink my hard drive crashed . It was no big deal, since Virtual PC was the only software installed on the entire drive. I got a new hard drive and thought I could just start over.  Of course, what was a bigger deal was reinstalling Virtual PC. The installed program refused to install it a second time, instead attempting to uninstall it. Since the program directory is gone, the uninstall fails. Can't install. Can't uninstall. Great. Solution? Go into the Windows registry and manually delete all references to Virtual PC. Once I did that, it installed.  Next challenge was installing an operating system into the new virtual space. It took me hours (no kidding) to figure out how to get Windows XP Professional to install there. Think of it like this. There is NO OS. Nothing but a blank C: drive. So I get a DOS boot floppy disk. But wait, DOS doesn't recognize the CD-ROM. OK, I get a DOS boot disk that recognizes the CD-ROM, but it doesn't recognize the C: drive. Perhaps C: is formatted NTFS, so I get a boot disk that recognizes NTFS. No dice, it's formatted FAT32. So I get another boot disk that recognizes both the CDROM and FAT32. Great, now the SETUP.EXE for the Windows XP CD won't run - "can't be run in DOS mode". Geez, Windows XP!!! What the HECK do you want from me?  Now I finally got past that issue, and it is taking HOURS for Windows XP to install. Copying files... I'm just about ready to give up. Something is wrong.  So the first surprise of this experience is that it's taken me 24 hours to get from installing Virtual PC to the "Copying Files" part of Windows XP setup.

      I recently had two hard drives fail on me - one at home and one at work. It's been quite a while (years, really) since that has happened to me, so it has really driven home the point about the importance of backups.  I was lucky this time. At work, I was able to retrieve the data on the disk before it completely failed. (That's the thing about hard drives... They often fail slowly.)  And with my home computer, the drive that failed was only a few days old, and I hadn't installed anything on it yet. Like I said, lucky me.  As I sit here writing this blog entry (on my new Toshiba e750 Pocket PC), I am running PowerQuest DriveImage 2002, which is backing up my complete computer to a new partition of the replacement hard drive I just picked up from the store.   Note to self:  I need to schedule this to happen once a week at least. I hope this practice really saves my ass one day.

      Canada, one of the largest countries in the world geographically, could not win a war against the tiniest of countries without help. Imagine if Canada (alone) invaded Iraq instead of the United States/Britain? Saddam would still be in charge. Canada against the Taliban? Sadly, our troops are still being killed in Afghanistan and there hasn't been a war there for years.  I hope the next Prime Minister, Paul Martin, decides at some point to completely reform the military. First, the military needs a clear and well-defined purpose. Let's assume the purpose is international peacekeeping. That is, let's publicly declare that Canada will never be involved on the military aspects of invading a country (except in financial and logistical support). While we're at it, let's clearly define the situations in which we will act as peacekeepers (relatively stable country) versus those that we won't (a country with many active guerrilas/terrorists).  Once the purpose has been defined, let's create the appropriate military structure. Do we need 400+ generals? Or can we flatten the reporting hierarchy so that we're not so top-heavy? Do we need better military vehicles -- tanks, SUVs, planes, ships? Do we need updated technology -- radar, bullet-proof vests, camoflage? Do our troops need better training to handle deserts and mountains?  This all costs money, and takes time. But if our country had the nerve to do it, it would be worthwhile. Worthwhile in terms of troop morale, in terms of lives saved (both inside our military, and the citizens of the country we're protecting), in terms of making consistent and explainable decisions on what missions we will accept. We also have to know our limits, and stop trying to do things that we're not equiped for.  Maybe we don't need nuclear weapons so much as we need new ideas. The Canadian military, to me, is like a dying garden. It's time someone watered it, pulled out the weeds, and did some relandscaping.

       urlLink Dave Winer writes : "Here's the deal -- we can't the war in Iraq." and "It's time to stick the tail between the legs and get ... out of there folks."  Is it time to leave Iraq? From my perspective, not yet. If America leaves Iraq in the state it is now, it will NEVER AGAIN have credibility in front of the world when it comes to its next regime change. (It barely found support for invading Iraq in the first place... next time, there will be NO other allies willing to support it.)  The U.S. could never threaten North Korea, nor Iran, nor Syria, with invasion and these countries would know it. The end results would be a more chaotic world, where rogue nations could openly persue nuclear and other weapons with impunity.  The best analogy is if a child disobeys his parents. When the parents go to spank him, the child ends up spanking the parents. If the parents just "put their tail between their legs and walked away" from that situation, what has the child learned? What has his brothers and sisters learned?  The lesson, I suppose, is that they should have thought it through before going down that path. If they did think it through, they should have made it clearer to everyone that this would not be a cakewalk. George Bush should NOT have stood proudly (and smugly) on that aircraft carrier declaring the war to be over.  In the end, the U.S. made a committment to the people of Iraq that they would suffer less after the fall of Saddam, not more. They haven't fulfilled that promise yet.   Incidentally, the same can be said of Afghanistan after the Taliban, where warlords rule the countryside. Are things better outside of Kabul than they were before? Debatable.

       urlLink Bob Cringely's latest article  is another in a long-line of rants against Microsoft, and in support of Open Source Software. Frankly, I'm getting tired of all the hype. Where's the beef?  Let's start by looking at the large, successful open source projects. I can count them on two hands: - Linux - Mozilla web browser - Apache - jBoss - Open Office - MySQL  Of the above list, four of them are good enough that they easily be used in place of expensive competitors (Linux, Mozilla, Apache, and jBoss). If I needed a Unix server, I would definitely go with Linux. But not for desktops, of course. But I'll still give it a passing grade for it's server usage.  The other two OSS projects (Open Office and MySQL) are good for some things but not for others. So they only get partial credit for being successful.  Every other open source software application in the known universe is either a niche success (ie: I don't consider a 'spam filter' or a 'notepad-replacement' a large enough project to count), or an outright failure.   So why does a web-site like Slashdot fall over itself to declare proprietary software "dead" after the business failure of ONE vendor? Open source projects "fail" all the time, as more than 100,000 projects on sourceforge are currently inactive. Other than the six noted exceptions above, why should MY company rely exclusively on any open-source project instead of buying an off-the-shelf package? When you compare having access to a tech support call-center to having access to the source code, business owners will choose tech support 999 times out of 1000.  Maybe I'm like Bill Gates --- I can see the appeal of OSS for the anti-Microsoft crowd (like Cringely and Slashdot), but I don't see the appeal for 97.9% of the rest of the population (according to recent Windows usage statistics).   How is the OSS model better than closed source model? Noone has been able to convince me yet - both have their pros and cons - and Cringely's article does little to clarify the argument.

      I've been following  urlLink a story  that has been slowly developing over in the amateur sports world, about a new drug test that has been developed to detect a previously-undetectable steroid.  It seems several sport federations are adopting this new test, and even retesting urine samples collected at past sporting events. The results of these retests will be interesting indeed!  The rumours circulating are that drug use is rampant in amateur sports. American athletes, in particular, are under great pressure to succeed at sports. And this pressure (along with the money and endorsement deals involved) can lead some athletes to cheat if they thought they could get away with it.  So does this new test throw a monkey wrench in the cheater's plans? Or have the athletes and their coaches been aware of this new test for months, and have switched to other undetectable steroids?  We'll see.

      I stumbled upon an incredible George Bush Sr. quote  urlLink on AlterNet :   "Trying to eliminate Saddam ... would have incurred incalculable human and political costs," wrote George Bush Sr in A World Transformed. "Apprehending him was probably impossible ... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq ... there was no viable 'exit strategy' we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."   Wow. I have been wondering for weeks that George H. W. Bush thinks about his son's recent campaign against the Middle East, and there you have it.

      In a recent  urlLink online commentary , CNN offers a glimpse of things to come for President Bush as he runs for reelection next year. Why isn't there public military honors for dead soldiers returning home? Is it to avoid depressing pictures on the nightly news?   "The scene so familiar to older Americans -- of the military honor guard in white gloves, respectfully accompanying from the aircraft to the waiting loved ones the remains of the fallen warrior in the coffin covered by Old Glory, often with a military band offering an appropriately solemn piece -- was simply banned."   Then the author draws a correlation to Viet Nam:   One of the most enduring criticisms from Bush's fellow conservatives of those Americans, especially liberals, who opposed the U.S. war in Vietnam was that, as a consequence of that vocal opposition, no parades or bands or celebrations were held to honor and welcome American veterans returning from that war.   To have conservatives blame the war critics for the lack of military honors shows what a warped view of the world they have.  I predict this "military honors" issue is going to become a bigger and bigger thorn in Bush's side as time goes on.

I stumbled across a blog called  urlLink Missy In France . The blog has several good things going for it. First, it's written by an American woman named Missy, who now lives in Toulouse, France. I don't have to tell you, that people who move to a new part of the world often have different perspectives on things.  It's also a beautiful looking blog.

       urlLink Reuters  is reporting that Russia is now willing to help Iraq reduce it's debt:   Russia has offered to write off 65 percent of Iraq's $8 billion debt to Moscow but the offer is conditional on approval by the Paris Club of creditor nations, a member of the Iraqi Governing Council has said.   The situation with Iraq's debt is tough. It's hard to choose the right course of action for creditor nations.  Creditors are right in that they did not support the war against Saddam, and now they are being forced to pay part of the financial cost of the reconstruction. Iraq is a rich country, they say, and will be able to pay their debts off using future oil revenues.  The United States is right is asking others to share in the financial cost, as they are giving $20 billion or so towards reconstruction. Why should others in the world reap financial reward (i.e. the payback of the loans with interest) from the U.S. treasury?  The people of Iraq of course would like to be a strong country again. With hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, they would find it hard to stand on their feet. Even if oil revenues could pay back most of this debt, they need money for rebuilding roads, fixing buildings, paying salaries, and all of the day-to-day needs.  If not a debt relief, Iraq certainly needs a debt vacation. Creditor nations should perhaps consider (a) giving up any interest they feel they are owed - turn all loans into 0% loans retroactively, and (b) give Iraq 5 years of no payments, so that it can spend its money on its people.  I feel the creditors deserve to get their money back, but there should be some relief for the people of Iraq. Noone (not even the United States) should benefit from the situation they are in.

       urlLink The Wright Brothers  must be having a good laugh at this. 100 years after the two flight pioneers became the first to fly, we still don't know how to do it. An attempt today to recreate their flight failed, as the craft just stopped dead in a muddy puddle and never got off the ground.

      I don't know why the new Prime Minister of Canada is upset the Americans are  urlLink excluding Canadian companies  from bidding on Iraq reconstruction contracts. Do Canadian companies really have a shot at winning those contracts? I mean, these contract usually go to reliable U.S. Department of Defense suppliers, people who donate lots of money towards the President's reelection, that sort of thing. We should just shrug our shoulders and say, "So what?".   I guess I understand the reasons why the Prime Minister had to "pretend" to be upset: (1) If somebody insults Canada, the Prime Minister cannot say "That's ok. We deserved it". They have to be offended, even if we deserved it. (2) Canada is contributing MONEY to the Iraq reconstruction project, even if we're not involved in the actual war. So shouldn't the "moral support" count for something?  In other Iraqi news, it looks like the U.S. government is paying $2.50 a gallon for gas in a country in which the average street price is $0.15 a gallon. Those are the type of government contracts companies are bidding for? That's a sweet deal for the Kuwati company who got the government to agree to that!

       urlLink Bob Cringely  gives props to Elections Canada in his latest column for our efficient and fair election process. Here is my 2 cents on the issue:  In the last City of Toronto election (last month), I filled out the traditional paper ballot where you "fill-in" a line next to the candidate you select. But what I really liked about their technique is that you, the voter, had to run it through a scanner before you were allowed to leave. If the machine couldn't read your vote... well, I don't know what they would do but I assume they would give you a new ballot and destroy the old one. Basically, there will never be spoiled ballots. Of course, the machine didn't tell the operator who the vote was for. And if an election was close in a particular riding, the ballots can still be hand counted.  When the election was over, we had the official results in less than 30 minutes. For a city of 3 million people, not too bad.

      The Michael Jackson case doesn't look to be a solid as prosecutors are making it out to be. It looks like these  urlLink same allegations  have been previously investigated and dismissed by child welfare authorities before:   Both the boy and his brother told investigators Jackson had not sexually abused them, according to the memo. Their older sister said she had never witnessed anything sexually inappropriate between her brothers and the entertainer.   And this:   The boy's mother told investigators in February that "she believed the media had taken everything out of context," the memo said. The mother said that the children were never left alone with Jackson and that her son slept in the same room with Jackson but never shared his bed. She said Jackson would sleep on the floor.   I wonder what the mother's excuse will be for those statements?  This case is starting to get sad. I mean, this poor boy is apparently dying of cancer. Apparently his condition is quite bad. And Michael Jackson's life and reputation has been forever destroyed. And the truth is, nobody knows what really happened. Maybe Jackson did do something, and was able to convince the family to overlook it for a while. Or maybe nothing happened, and the family is now exaggerating things to get back at him.   Only two people know for sure what happened - Jackson and the boy. Jackson tells his side (and nobody believes him). The boy cannot tell his side, since he is protected (and rightly so) by our system of justice. The mother can tell her side, but her story is full of holes. So what's this all about?

      The U.N. has referred the question of the legality of the  urlLink wall Israel is building to divide itself from Palestine  to the international court at The Hague.    The [U.N.] General Assembly passed a resolution in October calling on Israel to halt construction of the barrier and dismantle the completed section.   Israel has ignored the resolution.   When Iraq was in violation of several United Nations resoltions, the United States acted swiftly to force Iraq, one way or another, into compliance. Ultimately, the U.S. claims it invaded Iraq due to this non-compliance. So the question is this: where is the United States now? Israel is in violation of many U.N. resolutions (just like Iraq), and the resolution calling for the dismantling of the wall is just the latest example. Why isn't the U.S. using its influence on Israel now? Surely it should have more success getting Israel to comply than it did with Iraq, right?

      From this AP story,  urlLink Iraq reports record oil exports from Gulf :    Iraq boosted oil production to 2.1 million barrels a day last month...   A thought just occurred to me. What if one of the major reasons for invading Iraq was to break up the OPEC oligarchy? I mean, a handful of the major oil producing countries  conspire to fix oil prices  every month, keeping supply lower and prices higher. What if Iraq quits OPEC? Iraq could then produce as much oil as they want, and sell it as cheaply as they want. It would seem to me that other oil giants, like Saudi Arabia, would be forced to lower prices (and thus increase production) just to keep their income level steady.  I know 2 million barrels a day will not automatically mean the death of OPEC -- countries like Canada already produce oil without being a member. But it would be another brick on the camels back and could someday lead to the end of fixed oil prices. The U.S. will save billions every year just on lower oil prices.  Something to think about.

       urlLink Film Threat  has an interesting synopsis of a film Jerry Lewis made in 1972. It's (supposedly) a dark comedy, about a clown who is forced to lead children into the Nazi gas chambers. "The Day The Clown Cried". It should have been called "The Day The Clown Helped The Nazis Murder Dozens Of Children". It has all the markings of a film that could have been something, but has missed the mark so widely. In fact, some are even calling it the worst film ever made -- which is surprising since noone has actually seen it since it was never released.  I have never been a fan of Jerry Lewis' comedy, and I suspect his personality would irritate me so we could never become friends, but now I don't know what to think. The Film Threat article follows my point of view on this fairly closely.  Perhaps the wisest thing Lewis did was destroy the film. If it ever got out, it would ruin him for sure.

      I've reached a new milestone in my life, that I am dying to tell you about. I've recently discovered that 89% of all email I receive is SPAM&trade;. That's right... out of the 1,688 messages I have received over the last three weeks, 1,503 are of absolutely no use to me. That's astounding.  The main reason I am writing with awe and amazement, and not frustration, is that I have a very effective spam filter.  urlLink POPFile  absolutely rocks. POPFile is able to detect spam before I see it, and move it to a separate folder. It is 98.99% effective in doing this, which is amazing.   I could set POPFile up to delete the spam automatically, but I am still interested in seeing the spam before it's deleted. That's because (every once and a while) POPFile mistakenly classifies a good email as spam. I still care about finding the 0.2% of all messages this happens to, even though 99.8% makes it through.  Outlook 2003 has a built-in spam filter as well, but I haven't had a chance to try it.   The best solution for stopping spam in its tracks is to change your email address. I own a number of domains, so switching would be fairly easy for me to do technically. But there are so many reasons why it would be hard to do logistically that it's impractical.   A year ago, I was in favor of changing the SMTP specification so that it would be nearly impossible to send anonymous emails. If you get rid of anonymous emails, you get rid of spam. But now, with spam filters in place, I am content to leave things the way they are. The only problem becomes, I suppose, the financial cost of spam is still not covered by the spammers. That's a problem for the ISPs to deal with though.

I, for one, am glad that officers put themselves in harm's way to try to help these people and protect us all. Thank you.

      I read  urlLink this post  over at Josh Cagan's blog. I'll have to subscribe to that blog by the way, because Josh is quite funny and interesting to read.  Josh is looking for a good celebrity scandal for 2003. So far, what Hollywood has given us has not been much in his book. His essential point is this:   Is it a scandal when a short order chef makes a stack of pancakes? No. And it is not a scandal when a professional-grade boy toucher touches a boy. He's just following his job description. Get him out of here.   In Josh's eyes, Michael Jackson's latest legal problems are not a scandal because they are not shocking. Why? Because many, many people already believe that Michael Jackson is a pedophile, even before the current story surfaced. So, in general, most people's opinion of Jackson have not changed much over the last month or two.  To take this theory into the arena of politics, why didn't the country get into a great uproar when story after story came out about Bill Clinton's multiple infidelities? Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky. Only the Republicans cared about those things, and they only cared in order to gain more political power. Why wasn't Clinton forced to step down by some great public outcry? Because, everyone KNEW he was a filanderer when they elected him. One more allegation? Big deal. Take a number. Tell me something I don't know. If you recall, what almost got him impeached was not the infidelity, but the lie about the infidelity. Clinton was not immune from lying scandals, he was immune from sex scandals.  What about George Bush? In the last month or so, it looks like he's earned a similar "scandal immunity". George Bush lied about WMD in Iraq. Yes, we know. He lied about the reasons for the war. Yep. He lied about the timetable for the war. Check. He lied about the cost of war. Sure. He lied when he said the war was over back in May. You got it, Pontiac. He keeps blaming Iraq for September 11th - another clear lie. Yawn...  I think George Bush can now lie about anything, and it won't make front page news. The same way Clinton (and Schwarzenegger, I suppose) could grope women and get away with it, George Bush can now boldly lie without apology. So Bush lied about encountering a British Airways jet on his way to Iraq? No one cares. Bush lies - everyone in the country accepts this as a fact. His popularity ratings are up.  Now if you catch Bush in a sex scandal, or a money scandal, or something other than a lie, you might be able to stir the pot. But Jeff Probst has already handed him the Immunity Idol for Lying, and so he won't get voted out for that in 2004.  For Democrats, I can only offer this opinion. I don't think he has immunity for the war yet. If the war turns bad, or does not improve considerably, he might be weak there. But don't bother reading  urlLink Al Franken's  or  urlLink Michael Moore's  books -- the lies (and the lying liars that tell them) are old news.

       urlLink British Airways  refutes one of the most frequently told tales about the President's secret flight to Baghdad:   British Airways said on Monday that none of its pilots made contact with President Bush's plane during its secret flight to Baghdad, contradicting White House reports of a mid-air exchange that nearly prompted Bush to call off his trip.   Aha! I  KNEW  something was fishy with that story! It was just too cute, you know? Like a professional pilot (with tens of thousands of hours of flying experience) flying for one of the world's largest airlines would be dumb enough to ask, "Did I just see Air Force One?" over the radio?

      I think police definitely followed proper procedures when they attempted to arrest  urlLink 350-pound Nathaniel Jones . Fox News, of course, is trying to play the race angle for maximum ratings effect. But the sad fact is that Mr. Jones was clearly fighting the police, was high on cocaine and PCP, and could easily have harmed these officers if he had a chance to get close to them.  The people of Cincinnati should just accept that Mr. Jones got what he was looking for, and get back to normal. I can't believe the leader of the NAACP standing up for him though. The police were so clearly in the right on this -- it's not even close.

       urlLink Some in the Republican Party  honestly believe President Bush consistently demonstrates humility. Hmmm.... they must be using a different dictionary than I.   Humility (n):  Freedom from pride and arrogance  Was it humility that made George Bush tell Iraqi insurgents to "bring it on"? (Hundreds of American soldiers have been killed since then.) Was it humility that made George Bush tell the world "you're either with us or against us"? Was it humility that made George Bush tell the United Nations "we're going into Iraq with or without your support"? Those are all very arrogant statements. This administration has pretty consistently shown it's inability to listen to other points of view, or accept that it might, just this once, be wrong. Wipe that smirk off your face Mr. President.  They also give the President a lot of credit for flying into Iraq at a time of active hostilities, as if President Bush is one of the bravest men alive. I'll give the President credit for going there. But give me a break. He flew in, in the dead of night with the lights off. He was there for 3 hours, and then left.   I'm sure his visit inspired some of the troops, and that is a good thing. But let's put his action into perspective. He was probably in more danger while he was in Britain last week than while he visited Iraq. I mean,  urlLink almost anybody  can get a job serving food to the President and the Queen. And nobody is giving him credit for his brave trip to Buckingham Palace.

      It looks like the issue of same-sex marriage is finally coming to a head in the United States. There has been several court successful challenges recently that declare a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, and the  urlLink City of San Francisco  is granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  The United States should do what Canada has done. The Government of Canada fought this issue for years, up to the Supreme Court. But then suddenly is realized it was a battle not worth fighting, withdrew its challenge at the Supreme Court, and announced it would change the law -- legalizing same-sex marriage.  There are SO MANY problems in the world, and problems in the United States even. Wars are being fought, skilled people can't find work, there are thousands poor and homeless, jails are too full to hold all the criminals, and there have been many heinous crimes that have not been solved.... why do politicians and conservative groups waste all that precious time and energy fighting against equal rights for homosexuals? Why do congressmen hold hearings on the Janet Jackson SuperBreast? Why do they hold hearings investigating Martha Stewart?  Sometimes I wonder about people's priorities. Instead of making a list of the top 20 most important issues, and working hard on each of them, they let the important issues get progressively worse and focus in on such little, inconsequential stuff.

      I don't know the results of the election yet, so I don't know whether my vote made a big difference or not.  With a great deal of trepidation, I voted Conservative.  It's interesting (to me, at least) to note that a year ago I was whole-heartedly behind the Liberals. I thought Paul Martin could do no wrong. It was a slam dunk -- landslide win for Martin. So what happened?  Well, let's start with his predecessor, Jean Chrétien. The man announced his retirement, and then took over 1 year to leave power. During that long kiss goodbye, he was primarily concerned with only one thing: his legacy. What would the people of Canada remember him for? Because of this need for a legacy, the federal government basically did nothing for one year. The federal government basically went on vacation. (Well, maybe they didn't, but they might as well have been since they did nothing significant in that time.)  So then Martin takes over, in November, and almost immediately afterwards a scandal breaks out. It turns out the Liberals have been diverting millions of dollars to their friends in advertising agencies. Money was being spent, with no work being done. The government was spending several times the going rate for advertising in certain publications. Basically, the man who rescued Canada from debt and deficit now leads a party that put millions and billions of our tax dollars into the pockets of its friends.  The final straw for me, however, was the negative ads that have been consistently running on behalf of the Liberals. Ever since the first week of the campaign, the Liberals have been trying to scare me into voting for them.   Oh my goodness! What will Canadians do without the centerist Liberals in power?    So in the end, I voted for "a change". Perhaps in a few years the Liberals will be humbled enough to take power again, but they took me for granted. Please don't do that again...

      Today is a historic day here in Canada. We're having an federal election today, and it's expected to be the closest result in my lifetime. Much like the Bush-Gore debacle of 2000, a few thousand votes will end up being the difference in who gets to govern this country.  Now, there is a significant difference between the U.S. and Canadian political systems. In Canada, we don't vote for a Prime Minister. When I voted an hour ago, I voted for one person - my local Member of Parliament. At the end of the night, the party with the most MP's gets to form the government.   What makes it even more interesting is the prospect of a minority government. A minority government is one that needs the support of another party (or parties) to pass its legislation. Minority governments tend to last only a year or so before they fall, and another election is required.

         Kwame Jackson, the runner up on the TV show The Apprentice, was fired as a judge to the Miss Universe pagaent for saying hello to some beauty contestants that he bumped into in the hotel lobby before the competition.  Must be tough. A gaggle of beautiful women want to get your autograph, and you have to run the other way.  Goes against men's nature, I say.

       Yesterday, while riding my bike through the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), I saw a movie set for Cinderella Man. I had never heard of that title, so I assumed it was nothing special.  According to IMDB , the movie is directed by Ron Howard (wow) and stars Russell Crowe and&nbsp;Renee Zellweger. Russell Crowe is an idiot, but I wouldn't mind bumping into Renee Zellweger...   By the way, the scene I saw being filmed had dozens of old 1930's style cars. At first I thought it was some type of auto show, but all the cars were basically identical, so I wondered "who would want to pay to see 50 identical cars"?   I bet those cars aren't worth very much, because there more than likely just golf carts that have an old "Model T" looking body over them.   &nbsp;

      Right now  urlLink I rank 79,045 as an Amazon.com reviewer . I'd like to see if I could improve that drastically. I should be able to rank in the top 10,000 with a little more effort.

      Everyone has their pet peeves. Let me share one of mine. (I apologize in advance if your pet peeve is other people sharing their pet peeves.)  Have you ever been out with another couple (married or not), who don't mind arguing in front of you? What makes it worse is when you feel like their argument is over something that is very small - like somebody being 10 minutes late for dinner. It makes it even worse when they attempt to include you, like "You would call if you were going to be late, wouldn't you Scott?". Ugh. Get me outta here.

      Wow, I had no idea the death toll had gotten so high. How sad...  From  urlLink CNN :  Thursday's attack brought the number of U.S. troops who have been reported dead since the start of the war to  879  -- 656 of them were killed by hostile fire.  The number of multinational forces reported to have been killed in the war is  999 .   Also this interesting story:  The United States removed nearly two tons of radiological and nuclear materials from Iraq last month, according to the Energy Department. The material could have potentially been used to make a "radiological dispersal device" -- a so-called dirty bomb -- "or diverted to support a nuclear weapons program," the department said Tuesday.    Of course, the official Pentagon press release (which got reported widely in the media) doesn't tell the whole story.  From the  urlLink Washington Post :  The International Atomic Energy Agency kept Iraq's uranium under seal in storage facilities for more than a decade before the U.S. invasion in March 2003, but the storerooms were looted when Baghdad fell several weeks later.   The IAEA was allowed back into Iraq to help clean up the facility, and it urged U.S. officials to protect Iraq's former weapons sites from further looting.   But in recent months, radioactive equipment and Iraqi weapons components have been showing up in scrap yards and ports in Europe and the Middle East.   So it's a huge victory for Bush that 2 tons of nuclear material was removed one year after the war (however 400 tons remain). But what about the nuclear material looted after the fall of Bagdhad. You'd think that would be the FIRST thing the U.S. Military would have protected, even more than the ministry office buildings.

      The last three elections I have voted in (federal, provincial and municipal), none of the candidates I voted for won.  So the question I have to ask myself is, what's the point in voting in a election where I know my candidate will lose?  I don't know the answer.

       First, let me say what a bad concept this show sounds on paper. Before seeing it, I had my doubts. You take the daughter of a convicted mafia kingpin (and her family) and give them a reality show. Let's reward crime, yippie!  I'll start by stating the obvious.  urlLink John Gotti  is not someone anyone should admire. He was your basic lawless thug, with a touch of ambition and humongous ego. He started as a mob enforcer, which means he threatened people, beat people up and sometimes killed them. He committed violent crimes for a living. He rose through the mafia ranks by murdering his bosses. He died in prison.  (Incidentally, one of Victoria Gotti's brothers was also arrested for racketeering and is now facing a murder charge. Two of her uncles and one cousin are convicted mobsters. Her husband also has some racketeering and tax evasion charges pending. So it's safe to say she was surrounded by crime growing up.)  Even so, let's not smear the good name of Victoria Gotti with her family's crimes. As far as I know, she has was not involved in the mafia and has not broken the law in her life. She seems to want to distance herself from that life. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that.  Her kids appear to be both brats and thugs, which is a rare combination. They need their mother to cut their steaks for them, but at the same time have no problem cursing her out when she says "no" to something. They don't listen to her, and they don't respect her. A lot of fighting goes on, things in the house get knocked over, and the ocassional karate kick into a door. In short, I hate her kids. Seeing them in their life of apparent luxury (and being grateful for none of it) disgusts me. Jack Osborne is ten times more respectful to his parents than these brats, and I used to think he and his sister were pretty bad.  As for Victoria Gotti herself? First we should remember that she executive produces the show. She is the one who voice-overs the sappy narrative. This show is from the first-person perspective - her perspective. There's nothing objective here. The magic of post-production editing can cut the really bad parts out. This is not a documentary.  She starts off by saying people have certain preconceptions about her because of her name. For someone trying to  distance themselves  from the mafia, she sure  acts  like she's in the mafia. She offers a limo driver, jokingly I suppose, $1,000 to dump her blind date in a ditch somewhere. She takes offense to the suggestion that she could not be a good mafia hitman. She spends a lot of time berating a poor construction worker. Of course, he might have been trying to rip her off with his work estimate, and he did put his foot in his mouth in response to a comment she made, but once she got her teeth in him she took a certain amount of pleasure terrorizing the poor guy. He was shaking in his boots (or more likely peeing in his pants) at having offended a well-connected Gotti kid, and she didn't let him off easily.  I'll give her some credit. She has an interesting personality and character that it might (I said might) be worthwhile to explore. She seems driven - what makes her tick? Are we going to see different sides of her? She doesn't seem happy, why is that? Given how the Gotti name is associated with crime, is she doing anything to actively combat that? Is she trying to keep her sons away from that life? There are a bunch of possible storylines here. Only time will tell if any of those things get explored, or if we get the same crap served to us in the first episode.  In short, I don't “get” the appeal of this show. I suppose this would be the reality-tv version of The Sopranos. But watching Victoria Gotti and her brat children makes me sad. I keep waiting for something interesting to happen. But, nothing interesting ever does.   Other reality shows that follow a family or group around have things interesting insights to share with the viewers - The Osbornes, Newlyweds, Making The Band 2, etc. Each gives the viewer some insight into the life of celebrities in various stages of their careers. Ozzy Osborne is an iconic rocker who is now an old man (he can't work the TV remote, how cute?). Jessica Simpson is a young spoiled pop princess, trying to make it as an adult singer (don't offer her buffalo wings, because she doesn't eat buffalo). Da Band shows us how young artists go from nothing to something in a short period of time, and the challenges in handling that (what do you mean I have to work hard to become famous?).   What does Growing Up Gotti show us? She's not actually a mobster, so it's not like this is a real life The Sopranos or Godfather. Noone is going to get whacked. She's a minor celebrity at best (NY newspaper gossip columnist), so it's not a behind the scenes look at fame. There's not much mention of money, so it's not a look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. What new and interesting insights am I to get here?   The show seems to talk a lot about how difficult it is to be a single mother. Well, that may be interesting to some, but not to me. Plus, I hate her kids, so she hasn't really done a good job of that. For the type of show that it is, a look at the daily drugery of life, they could have picked many more interesting subjects. Donald Trump would be interesting. Mark Cuban. Any kinda-famous actor -- Drew Carey or Ellen Degeneres for instance.  Critics have said this show is a one-trick pony. I suspect that it is. A&E convinced John Gotti's daughter to do a TV show. And all the king's horses and all the king's men, couldn't make it interesting.

       urlLink CNN Money  has posted this helpful article.  1. Correct blatant mistakes 2. Pay your bills on time 3. Reduce your credit card balances 4. Pay off debt rather than moving it around 5. Don't close unused credit card accounts near loan time.

      Given my experiences with unemployment (unpaid time off between contracts), I like to have a certain supply of cash that's relatively easy to get to. Whether it is actual money in the bank, unused line of credit, or funds stashed away in investment accounts, I get a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing that I can survive for a certain period of time without income.  At the present time, I figure that I could survive just over 12 months before I will have to do something radical like tap into my home equity or borrow from credit cards. And if tapping into home equity isn't considered radical, I could probably survive 4 years this way.  So the question is, is it worth trading a little piece of mind (in the form of withdrawing money from my "unemployment fund") for a little piece of mind (in the form of less debt and lower monthly payments). I mean, what is the trade off here? What is the ideal balance between debt and cash-on-hand?  I suppose having 12 months of expenses as cash is a bit excessive. I mean, with my current skillset, and the economy improving slowly, I will never need to relive the cold winter of late-2001. But I can't help but be paranoid.  So what I have decided to do is withdraw two months worth of expenses, and use the money to pay down debt. This reduces my safety net to only 10 months. But reduces my monthly minimum debt payments by 10%. (Man, those credit card interest rates are a killer!)

      In my last entry, I gave an overview of the ups and downs of my income over the years. But that is only one side of the equation. Let's look at the other.   Expenses   At one time in my life, I didn’t have to think too much about my expenses. Back before 2001, I was living without worrying about money. That allowed me to travel all over the world, go out to dinner several nights a week, and even purchase a nice condominium on the Toronto waterfront.  My biggest problem, at this point, is the high cost of credit payments. I pay as much in credit payments as I do for my mortgage. It’s insane – I could afford two houses!   Savings and Assets   Ah, and now we’re cutting to the chase, aren’t we? Despite my problems with debt, I have done alright with savings and assets. I could be well ahead, but I also could be penniless. Anything is better than nothing.  During the late 90’s, I did fairly well at putting aside money in my retirement account. In 1999, I used most of that money as a down payment on my condo. Lucky for me, I missed the drastic drops in stocks over the past few years – I sold at the peak.  My condo has done well. I estimate its value has increased by 30% since I moved in. Add my original 15% down payment to that, and I have a significant amount of equity waiting to be tapped. (Last year we refinanced our mortgage to lock in a low rate, and take a few bucks out to pay debt. The debt paid off at that time remains paid off.)  I also have some money tucked away in cash (for emergencies), and have been putting some into my retirement accounts. Again, my bad experiences with unemployment make me want to keep lots and lots of cash on hand just in case.  In my next entry, I will discuss my problems with debt. Then we can wrap the story up with a discussion of net worth.

      It’s difficult for me to get specific with you about my finances. Heck, besides my wife and a few bankers, I have never let anyone know the specifics of my finances. But, every time I apply for a credit card or a loan, I have to write down the details of my income, my assets and the balances of my credit. So I suppose privacy is only an illusion for me – certainly almost anyone can order my credit report and get all the gory details of my life for a few dollars. (I found out today that companies don’t need your permission to get your credit report, which was a shock to me.)   Income   I am actually a very lucky guy. I was a bit of a slacker in high school and university, yet I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I then lucked into a relatively high-paying job right out of University without even trying.  After 6 years of working full-time, I decided to branch into consulting since I had several friends who were doing it and making good money. The money was in fact very good – my salary doubled overnight. I was  urlLink living the life of Riley . In the end I discovered it was too good to last.  My first contract lasted two-and-a-half years. I actually refused to renew my contract at that company because I wanted a change. My next contract was one-and-a-half years. At the end of two contracts (4 years), my income was 75% higher than when I started contracting. I was making an excellent living.  Then, two things happened. First, the dot-com bust of early 2001 when computer-related jobs started to dry up; and second, the terror attacks on New York in September 2001.  At the time of the attacks, I was working at Fidelity Investments and my contract was supposed to end September 15, 2001. Truth be told, I was not happy with the work, and I just wanted to finish what I was doing and get out of there quickly. Well, as fate would have it, that Friday my contract did not get renewed. Since the stock markets were still closed after the attacks, and I was working at a mutual fund company that relied on the stock market for part of its daily business, I was not too surprised at that turn of events. I was involuntarily unemployed for the first time – ever.  Actually, what I said to myself was that I would not mind a couple of month’s vacation. I had been working for 10 years at that point, without any significant time off, so I actually said to my friends and family, “I’m looking forward to some time off.” Stupid me.  Winter 2001 was very cold – both weather-wise and job-wise. It took me six months (til the end of February 2002) to find my next contract. And as soon as the ink was signed, the employees at my new client went on strike for two months. So I could not do anything but sit and wait for them to get back to work. That was eight full months with absolutely no income.  When I did get back into working, my consulting rates were way down. And they have getting worse since then, not better. And I also am finding that it is taking more time to find my next job at the end of each contract. I am off 6 weeks a year on average, which just makes the income situation worse.

        What is FICO?   Credit reporting agencies have recently moved to a "single number" to report your credit score. This is called your FICO&trade; Score. (FICO&trade; is named after the company who made credit scores popular, Fair Isaac Corp.)  FICO scores range from 300 - 900. In reality, credit companies give everyone a starting score of 850, and deduct points based on their credit history. Of course, it is more complicated than that, but essentially that's how it works.    My FICO Score   I purchased my credit report today (08-06-2004), and found out my FICO score is 704. Now 750 is considered median, in that half the population have scores under that amount and half are over.  So what this means is I have  slightly  below-average credit. This is causing me some concern right now, and is the primary reason I started this blog. I suspect that it will not be too difficult, mostly through personal education, to raise that score above the 750 mark.  The nice thing about the credit report is that it breaks tells you the top 4 primary factors affecting your FICO number. According to today's report, mine are:   1. The amount owed on credit cards and loans is too high  I already knew this. I have a lot of debt. It wasn't always like this, but I will get into the reasons why it happened another time.   2. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards and loans is too high  I don't quite understand this aspect of FICO, and will spend time learning more about it. In theory, if you have a $10,000 credit limit and you have a $7,500 outstanding balance, you have a 75% debt-to-credit-limit ratio. My ratio is currently 66% - but I am getting dinged for this number being too high.   3. The proportion of balances to credit limits on credit cards is too high  Same as above.   4. Relatively high number of accounts with balances.  This means I have too many loans and credit cards. But because this is the fourth item on the list, it is the one least affecting my score.  In coming blog entries, I will explore ways to improve each of those four areas. Then I will check my credit score again in a couple of months to see if there is any improvement.

      Well, let me start off by saying hello. Welcome to my blog on personal finances.  I sit here today, in August 2004, in a bit of a personal dilemma. I have a fairly good credit history - no bankruptcies or missed payments on my credit report. Yet my FICO credit score is less than perfect. I really want to find ways to improve that score, so I don't have trouble getting a loan when I really need it. What's the problem, and what I can do to fix it?  I aim to explore those questions. Along the way, I'll point out sites that contain useful information. I will post useful information of my own. And I will track my own personal progress here.  I hope you can respect the fact that I am hesistant to devulge too much personal information here. I don't want people to know my personal income, or my net worth, et cetera. But I do want to document my journey, and this site is the place I will do it.  Cheers!
