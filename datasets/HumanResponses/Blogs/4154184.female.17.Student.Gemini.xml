        The moment that I've been waiting for : when Mas was asked to leave the Academy...sounds cruel huh? Bukan ape, annoying gile tengok MAS FC dekat Channel @15. Sket2 Puji lebeh2. Pastu salahkan fans yang lain sebab kutuk Mas. Like..Hello?? I dun even like to talk about Mas! (buang air liur je) Until Mas nye fans ckp camtu lagi encourage orang lain cakap. And Mas, despite having unique tone of voice,  she didnt know to use it well. (sad) Her low tone is dissapointing. Its not that she's not good at all..but unfortunately, its obvious that some other students are way better than her. (but they end-up sitting "down" watching the survivors) yeah..once again, the malaysian are blind! (Remember Rosma?)           The climax of yesterday's concert : Ramli MS Announced That There Will Be 6 Students To The Final.           At that time, I was a little shocked. "Mas is going back in??? This couldnt be!!" Hoho! Memang nak dekat frust la kan. Seb baik dier cakap boleh dipilih dari semua student yang dah kluar. Muahaha! I am so wanna AFMASUK ANDING! tapi Linda lebeh layak untuk masuk final kut. (No offence Anding) For those who intend to AFMASUK MAS..think before you act. This is for the sake of our own music industry. Give the chance to Linda since she has a great and unique voice. Zarina's okay as well. Anding is too. =)  Not to forget, EDLIN!! ~~                     Final : Adam, Zahid, Kaer, Farah, Bob and ?????

        Imagine..earn money while sleeping. Yes! There is a way. All you have to do is keep online while you do whatever to wanna do. (sleeps,shop,eat,etc).  Visit Peer Community -   https://www.porivo.com/peernetwork/jsp/programDetails.jsp    p/s: but u have to pay for the membership. Im not sure how much will it cost but think if you dare to risk why not? Maybe they would pay you more than you pay for them? So if anyone of you have your own credit card (bank accounts)..try it out! (I dont think my parents let me..maybe I'd try it myself in future..the time when I earn my money myself)  By the way..Im just TELLING u guys about this Money Making Site. Its not that Im GUAREENTED wutsoever.

       Ha-Ha. I've been waiting for FOOTBALL MATCH for a long time! Since the previous season ended few months ago, my weekends sux! Anyway, Cant wait to see the match against Arsenal. Im not sure on our chance (cheh..OUR gitu) to win because Sir Alex did mention to the media that he's going to rest the senior players. Besides that, Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Solskjaer are injured. Although we have the new signing Alan Smith plus other strikers, but we dont know hows the "partnership" gonna be. Hopefully, United, again (yes again!) will win the Community Shield trophy. I know this match is not a big..um..achievement (if we win) but still..Its a great start to boost up their confidence &amp; team spirit. We cant afford to lose anymore match after the USA tour. ( Yeah..sad! But I know they did their best )          So United, why dont you kick the Gooner's asses and remain unbeaten by Arsenal this Sunday?! Well, Best of luck and Im sure gonna give ya my full support! (bet the others will too)             GO MANCHESTER UNITED

        Yes, fiendster.com. And I'm not a bad speller who doesnt know how to spell 'friend'. So, why FIEND?. I discovered this website (    urlLink   www.fiendster.com      ) on a magazine ( CLEO ).  So basically, it is just a frienster-haters. Or shall I say..antifriendster site? I thought it has anything cool in it but none. (or Im the one who doesnt really explore the..thing) wutever it is.. Its lame. But try and check it out!           By the way, this is my first time here ( in blogger.com ). I dont really blog because I dont have the time. But blogging is interesting ya know. It is something that everyone should do. BLOG! - yeah, Its easy for me to say.. I myself is not a good blogger.     p/s: Anyone here good in HTML? or RICH with HTML code?
