      Hey everybody ! back home again, and feeling strange as probably most of U! But  don´t actually have time to think whether I like it or not, ´cause there´s just to much to do, too many friends to say hello to and too many amaaaiiizing things to rediscover about my beloved Bavaria ;-)  - Hope you won´t beat me up for that Amy-just had to mention it for your sake !! Miss U, Chrissy

       Just found a flight from stansted to Dublin for about £10 return, thats about 15 euros to those of u who are not fortunate enough to have the pound! The prices are probably gonna go up so we should book as soon as possible.  I need some Ubriasmus! October's not that far away..............!

       Sorry folks! I never ment to just suddenly disappear from your lives completely! My cell phone is down, so I haven't been able to re-squillo or text anyone so far. I'm working on the issue, though. For more details and updates I also have my personal blog:   urlLink http://kauge.blogspot.com
