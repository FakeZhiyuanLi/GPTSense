      As you may have noticed, I dislike a lot of things. I don't like politics, I don't like the way the country is run, I don't like the National Curriculum, I don't like reality television, I don't like children, I don't like adults, you can probably see where I'm going with this: I dislike a lot.   But all of that people can handle. They say "yeah... I see your point."   However, there's one thing that sends people into fits of disbelief, their minds are shunned into dubious incredulity, they take on a defensive stance and tell me I'm clinically wrong in the head. What do I say to get this reaction? "I hate Harry Potter"  THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS!!! I can't stand the little horror.  I was having a discussion with my friends in the 6th Form common room and they were telling me how the books are brilliant, and the characters are great, the storyline is wonderful etc. Then someone told me that I obviously hadn't read the books. Well excuse me, but how could I possibly have formed an opinion if I hadn't *tried* to read the godforsaken thing?! Sheesh.   I tried to read the books and got to about the second chapter and the thought washed over me like a calm little wave on a Caribbean beach; 'my 12 year old brother could have written this'. I didn't like J.K's style at all. To me, it is childish and quite frankly, boring. That's right! I said HARRY POTTER was BORING. HA!   And then the films came out. Loooovely. I'm an avid movie watcher, I do enjoy films. I like the artistic value behind them as well as the storyline. And I can honestly say, I have not yet sat down in order to watch one of the Happy Rotter movies. My brother has acquired copies from his little friends and I can say I have seen parts of them here and there (the movies, not his friends, that is) and I wasn't very impressed. What I like most are the parts played by Robbie Coltrane and John Cleese. What I don't like are the overacted child parts. I'm sure Daniel, Emma and Rupert are lovely people, but the films just aren't my thing.  Although I suppose the thing I dislike most about it is the titanic hype around it. When a new HP book is released people seem to want to queue overnight to buy their copy at some ridiculously early hour of the morning. People claim "these are the best books I've ever read!" "Harry Potter's awesome!" What I want to know is, would they have the same reaction if the hype wasn't so big? Would they still love it so much if there wasn't so much merchandise around it? Would they still think it was one of the best things ever written? I doubt it.  I'm not saying I hate Harry lovers, because that's not true. If it were true then I wouldn't have any friends, but I am proud to say I am not a Harry lover. I just love to hate him.  You know the old saying; 'don't knock it until you've tried it'. Well, as far as Harry Potter is concerned, I have tried it. And now I'm knocking it.

      According to the BBC (HA!) in between 60% and 70& of children in between 6 and 17 are overweight.   Apparently, they don't get enough exercise.  Apparently, they watch too much T.V.  Apparently, they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables.  Apparently, the food they eat at school is too high in sugar.  Why do I keep putting the word 'apparently' at the beginning of my sentences? It's all true, isn't it? Yes, yes it is. But i'm just slightly humouring the situation. Who are the ones saying all this? The government...teachers...parents... what do all these people have in common? (Overworked and underpaid? Possibly, but that's not the answer I'm going for.) The thing they all have in common is that they are all ADULTS. The very essence of society.   A child's parents are the main influence on said spawn's life. They are the ones who shape it, mould it into fine human beings. Does it not stand to reason that if the child is introduced to exercise at a young age, and parents make the exercising fun, then the child will grow up to enjoy exercise and will remain fit and healthy.  The parents are also the ones who have the final say on how much television a child is permitted to watch, how much time they spend playing computer games etc. Children have absolutely no sense of common reasoning, so isn't it obvious that it's their parents who should be firm in their discipline and cast the deciding vote on such activities?  Lunchbox-style food is aimed at children, it's packaged in pretty colourful boxes with free toys; the kinds of things kids like. Most of these kinds of foods are extremely high in additives, namely because they're cheaper and easier to mass-produce. BUT if they made the things with proper ingredients, then the kids would be getting better stuff.  Now, the whole food thing just really racks me off, because, quite frankly, who does the shopping?! If the parents didn't buy all the rubbish they seem to be feeding their offspring, then the kids wouldn't eat it! Take me, for instance. My dad buys cereal bars instead of chocolate, extra fruit instead of crisps, cranberry juice instead of fizzy drinks: you catch my drift? If he bought sweets and fatty foods and the such, then that's what I'd eat!   Except I wouldn't, actually, because now i'm old enough to see beyond the pretty colourful package and realise exactly what good food is. I know how to cook, and I can cook for my brother and I, and a whole host of guests if needed, when my dad's at work. I think for kids to learn how to cook would be a great step for the government, then they'd have more scope as to what they can make. (Move over Gordon Ramsey, your time is up.)  I just don't see how all these adults can be so BLIND, when they're the ones to blame. Children have purely hedonistic lifestyles: they don't save for university from the age of 5, they don't think of career plans, they don't compare calorie intake in different foods. If you know a child like this please call me, so I can come and shoot it. Adults just need to guide the youngsters, and then we can let them grow up and be happy, healthy, generally lovely human beings. Or politicians, but methinks that's a story for another day.  Byebye, everybody, byebye.

      It would seem that everyone my age is fluent in this new hybrid language known as 'txt'. For anyone who doesn't know, txt is the language originating from mobile telephones, commonly used in IM (instant messaging) and E-mail. It's basically the act of abbreviating normal words into a scramble of jumbled letters that most youngsters can read better than regular English.   Just to give you a taster, here is an extract from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", translated into Txt:  "call u me fair? tha fair agen unsay. Demetrius luvs ur fair: o hpy fair! Ur i's r lode-*s; n ur tung's swet air More tunable, thn lark 2 sheprds eer, Wen weet is grn, wen hawthrn buds apeer. Siknes is catchin: O, wer faver, er I go; My eer shud catch ur voice, my i ur i, My tung shud catch ur tung's swet meldy. Wer da werl mine, Demetrius bein batd, Da rest id giv 2 b 2 u transltd. O, teech me ow u luk, n wid wat art U sway da moshun ov Demetrius's hart"  Now, I probably shouldn't have used Shakespeare as an example, seeming as he was practically in his own little world anyway, some of the stuff he wrote was just bonkers, but you see my point, no?   Ok, I confess to the occasional 'lol' (laugh out loud) or brb (be right back), but I would never lower myself to the extent of typing "imnsho" (in my not so humble opinion). Lol. Idiots.  We are a nation of changers. We make something, then we want to make it either bigger or smaller. Food we make bigger (unless you're a professional chef in which case the food gets smaller and the cost gets bigger) and appliances are getting smaller. I'm all for economising, really I am, but there should be a limit to how much we can minimise things before we cross the line from economical to just downright stupid.   Today's youth are tomorrow's future. If things keep going the way they are now we'll all be reading newspapers called things such as "Da Tymes" and "Da Dayly ExprS".  On the other hand, maybe it wouldn't be so bad... after all... "2 b or not 2 b, dat iz da qu." has quite a funny ring to it. And Shakespeare was a bit of a weirdo when it comes to language. Maybe the era of Txt will spawn a new race of superb playwrights? Well, either that or a race of idiotic super-morons.   Well, whatever the Children of the Revolution do, you can safely guarantee I'll be up there on the frontline - pioneering against it.

      I read in the newspaper today an article about this so-called "political correctness", and how the term "hardworker" is no longer acceptable in job advertisment, as it is discriminative.   I'm sorry to be blunt, but what the **** is going on with the world?! If I was a lazy little sod, then I'd like to know in advance whether it was a physically or mentally demanding job, which took lots of time, precision and effort then I'd avoid it and do something else, like be a politicion, for instance.  Here are a few examples of things that have changed due to the explosion of PC:  Dinnerladies are now known as MIDDAY SUPERVISORS Half-caste is now known as OF MIXED RACIAL ORIGIN  and my personal favourite:  Bin men are now URBAN WASTE DISPOSAL OPERATIVES.  "oh darling I'm just going to put the bin out... the urban waste disposal operatives are here."   I think not.  I'm glad terms like "nigger" have gone out of use. For one thing, that's just not a very nice word even when taken out of context. But it's used nowadays by 'black' people in rnb and hiphop style songs when they refer to each other as "niggas". of course this is different, though, as it has the uber-cool 'a' instead of the ever familiar 'er'.  Have you ever seen the tv programme Love Thy Neighbour? Well it features a white man and a black man, and the relationship between them. They hate each other. Here's a short typed extract.  White man (I don't know his name) *makes phone call*: Hello? Is that the racial complaints board? ...Yes I'm white. All over. And proud of it... Yes I have a problem with a black man. ........................What's he done? He's moved in next door, that's what he's done!"  I'm not in the slightest bit racist, but at the time it was chuckleworthy, lighthearted comedy. But of course, it was removed from television due to being offensive to black people. Change of scenery, come up-to-date a little, and watch the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. They constantly make comments about black people, and to white people, make the same sort of comments that would be considered racist if it was the other way around. But I can sit and laugh at it, because it's not real. People forget that in these tv shows are fictional characters, and nobody is being harmed in any way.  I don't see as there's anything wrong with it as long as people are aware of the boundary.   If we can't laugh at our differences, then we have absolutely no hope of ever surviving all together as one. The fact that we're all different is one of the most amazing things about the human race, and we should be able to acknowledge and humour that. If we're going to continue the way we are now, banning words and phrases like "dinnerladies" then we are driving the human race into an oblivion of politically correct ruins and we'd be better off shooting ourselves now while we still can.  Bloody politics.

      Have you ever noticed how people change, when they hear something you said about them, from someone else? Well recently that happened to me, and a certain person (let's call her...Mrs G) started being abnormally friendly towards me.   It all started last September, when I started an AS subject, with a certain teacher. It was perfectly clear to everyone that she didn't like me from that very day. For instance, she would request for me to close the door, even if she was closer to it than I was. She'd pick on me in lessons when she knew damn well I wasn't listening at that point. (Ok... my bad)  When it came to essays, when I handed them in, she'd hold it between her fingers grudgingly and skeer at it through a grimace and sneer "it's very short." in a judgemental tone.   What really knocked her out of my boat, though, was when she came to me on the night of my Theatre Studies performance evening (she was "covering" at that point for, let's say... Mrs S, our usual TS teacher, who had been unfortunately ill for a number of weeks). She told me that I hadn't handed in my portfolio to her, and denied all knowledge of ever seeing it. Then after a couple of minutes of me almost having a heart attack and trying desperately to tell her that I did in fact hand it in, she responded "oh... it might be in my office".  Anyway, I suppose it really took off just before an exam, the exam in the subject that said Mrs G taught me, and I was missing something I needed for said exam. However, I didn't go to Mrs G, I went to Mrs S, who so kindly helped me find the item I required. Upon finding out, Mrs G was horrified I didn't go to her first, as my subject teacher, and proceeded to tell Mrs S that she did in fact like me and was upset that I hadn't asked her for it.  (I'd like to point out at this point, if I had gone to Mrs G in that time of need, she would in fact have eaten me, no doubt about it)  Since then, Mrs G has been unbelievably friendly, chatty, just unnervingly lovely. She complimented me by telling me I looked stunning, enquired as to my continuing the subject, let me borrow her CD player, etc. I think perhaps she's trying to lull me into a false sense of security?   Well whatever she's doing, I don't trust her anymore than I'd trust George Bush to do something intelligent, and I dislike her on an equal par with how much I dislike Harry Potter (see previous post). The only thing about her that has changed my opinion of her is that now I see her slyness, and I'm warying of that. Whether she intends to be patronisingly nice, I don't know; and whether she's aware that I will proceed to take considerable advantage of said niceness, I don't know either. What I do know is this: she sure as hell ain't gonna win me over by a few friendly comments and a smile now and again, and if she thinks she can, then she's got another thing coming.   It would seem she's playing mind games... and crossing into my territory with that. "Who's for the game? ...The red crashing game of a fight?"   I am.

      I went shopping today. Well, I suppose I was more rightfully 'browsing' with some friends who were shopping. Anyway, we took a trip to local high-street clothes stores H&M and New Look. Ooooooooh what fun.  Some of the items were nice. (Notice the use of that word I don't like using because of its blandness, but in this case it's apt so I'll use it). And some of the other clothes were downright horrid. Not just ugly, not just hideous, I'm talking completely outrageously kick-you-in-the-nuts painfully putrifying. And I'm not kidding.  Just for a laugh we decided to select an outfit for each other, and the results were just so wonderfully hilarious I couldn't not comment on it here:  I was given a short, pleated orange skirt with buckles, to wear in partnership with a black, tight top with no sleeves or straps, which was covered in rainbow-coloured shiny sequin-like pieces. The outfit was finished off with a lovely black hat. I looked like the Whore of Babylon, having just come out of a disco.  T, on the other hand was given a leopard-print, (extremely) tight miniskirt, and matching strappy, low-cut top. She looked like a hooker version of Bet Lynch.  Another of the concoctions I tried on was a yellow halterneck dress with a white and yellow strappy top on UNDERNEATH, and a blue denim pleated miniskirt over the top. The kind of thing you might see on a catwalk, not on me. Honestly, it gave a whole new meaning to the phrase "Kodak moment".  It makes you think though, doesn't it; do people actually wear these things casually? And if so, why? Do they honestly think it looks good? Each to his own, I suppose. But what happened to individuality, eh?   Has it come to this, that people wear such strange things just because it's in fashion, and they don't want to be considered a social reject?  Well maybe it's just me, but I'd rather be a social reject than be seen alive in some of those ghastly outfits. Now I'm off to talk to some of my other reject friends and drink tea. Y'all have a good night now.
