      Yes, you're totally right and I agree with almost everything you said.  Obviously as long as anyone is alive, they are "living life."  Life is experience.  And experience is found in every waking moment.  I think what I should have said was this:  for me, personally, what I find most fulfilling to  my  life are such activities as painting and writing (etc.) and that I do not find activities like watching TV and playing board games  as  fulfilling (to what ideas I have in my head of a meaningful life (whatever that means in the midst of all this absurdity!), and enjoyment/pleasure I get from the act of thinking about stuff, and as satisfying my ground-projects that I've set myself for life (like becoming a writer, wanting to understand my reality more (i.e., philosophize), and other certain, specific activities that my particular being finds distinctly enjoyable (i.e., fulfilling)).    I was wrong to generalize my personal feelings about my personal life to be applied to life in general.  Not everybody (for example) would find philosophy fulfilling (in fact most don't) so I shouldn't be ascribing my own value system to people in general when the values I place on these activities are simply my own.  I don't think everyone  should  do philosophy (or the same things in general) because if everyone pursued the same activities, that would just make for a very boring society.  Like you said on the phone last night, life is found in the variety of experience, not just the experience of certain variety.    Now for a few more directed responses to explore some more specific issues:  1. "[Your distinction] puts these activities into two completely separate and different (opposing) categories"  You're right, and I believe I was being overly dramatic in my distinction between "living life" activities and "waiting to die" activities.  But I do think there exists a distinction between what-I-find-fulfilling activities and what-I-do-not-find-fulfilling activities.  This is purely subjective and personal on my part and thus I do not believe it can (or should be) generalized to everybody (we're each our own selves with different what-I-find-fulfilling interests).    What I would like to point out, though, is that given this subjectivity, I then would believe that  my  what-I-find-fulfilling activities are (to me) "living life" activities, and vice versa.  When I am participating in what-I-do-not-find-fulfilling activities, I sometimes start to  feel  like I'm just "waiting to die."  I can hear you saying now that all activities are valuable for the experiences they provide us in life.  Playing board games allows for social interactions (beyond the board game proper) and watching TV is sometimes desirable beyond ground-projects like writing etc.  You're right that if I spent all my time "just writing" I would feel equally unfulfilled (and in fact my writing would become incredibly boring due to my lack of anecdotal experience upon which I could draw for material).   There needs to be a balance .    Variety is important.  Sometimes I will indeed (need to) watch television and vedge out, and do other such activities which do not necessarily directly contribute to my ground-projects/fulfilling-experiences.  The enjoyment I find in those other experiences is relative to the other experiences I have (not that the other one's are "lesser" or something, but just different kinds/ways of living life that contrast and define all the other kinds/ways).  All I'm saying is that each of us has certain activities we find  more  fulfilling than others and that when faced with these "others" we may not necessarily always enjoy them (or find them fulfilling) even though they can be experiences and can be living life and can be good.  They may not always feel good or be what we want to be doing.  Why should we force ourselves to do something we don't enjoy just because we think that all experiences are good?    I think all experiences have a positive value to them, but I don't believe that all experiences have an equal amount of that value (but I believe that the distribution of value is something that I've set for myself, personally... others may have different distributions which may put watching TV at a higher priority than wasting time typing nonsense into a computer ;)  So when one of my experiences "uses up" its value for me (whatever "using up" means and in whatever way I am able to measure value:  I think this is something subconscious (i.e., I "just feel it" or "just know" rather than having a conscious status report of my value distributions and their varying levels of satisfaction)) I may not necessarily want to (or enjoy) continuing that experience.  In such a circumstance I may even feel like I'm not enjoying (or "living") my life.  Let me qualify this feeling a little more so it's not as severe as I'm probably sounding.  In all experiences, I believe there is a wide range of combined values being had at any one time.  So, for instance, when I'm watching TV, I may loose interest in the TV proper but still be enjoying the conversations I'm having with my friends, hugging me girl friend (that's you ;), eating some food, or just relaxing my brain.  What I mean is that "watching TV" is not  just  watching TV, but involves a bunch of other activities which may have value for me as well.  But on some rare occasions, I may get tired of all the associated activities and want to pursue some other satisfying/fulfilling activity.  And my saying out loud "I've had enough watching TV for now" may in fact mean that I've had enough with watching TV  and  its associated activities.    I don't think there's anything wrong with this though.  I'm not trying to devalue any particular activity in particular, only that I'd like to express that particular activities for particular people can be particularly more or less valuable.   2. "...if you're walking in the forest and you're heading along a cleared path, isn't your walk already pre-determined by somebody else and the trees and scenery that you see around you already chosen by the people who created the path interacting with friends and learning and growing in a different way?"  You're so right!  Great analogy and comparison to my examples.  Yeah I guess everything we do can be more or less related to what somebody else has already done (i.e., designed for other people to experience).  I mean even looking at a piece of artwork is experiencing a "designed" life.  What I was most concerned with was the individual design of life (the individual's free choices).  I can see now that we can also choose to design a designed life for ourselves.  Sometimes I may want to experience looking at a painting that was designed by another person's free choices and as such live a "second-order" experience.  The thing is that because I choose to have that experience, I take ownership of it and it becomes a "first-order" experience while I'm having it.  I'm the only me that has ever existed and could possibly be here now looking at this painting at this time of day from this angle and having the sorts of thoughts that I'm having about it.  That's  my  experience and  my  life, and I've chosen to live it that way.  Right on!  Similarly I could choose to watch TV or play cards or surf the internet and because I will have chosen to do those more constrained activities they are still just as "free" as any other activity.   3. "The value is found not in the game itself, but in the social interaction that the game allows for."  ...and other things beyond even the social interaction (social interaction on its own isn't the only reason we enjoy such activities; although it may be an aspect of the activity which you in particular find to be of greater value).  There might be other things like the element of chance and mystery in a card game, the rush of adrenaline of betting on uncertainty, the motivation to win, the interaction with friends, the breaking-of-the-ice that the game provides for opening up conversations between people, the mental occupation/entertainment it provides, etc.  It's all these things together which relatedly constitute whatever value the activity has.  Some of these things are important to different people, and some of them aren't.  I think that's also the variety of life ;)   4. "Basically what i am trying to say in a convoluted kind of way is that everyone differs in their interpretation of what is 'fulfilling'.  What kinds of activities they find meaningful enough to pursue."  Yes.  Everybody is different.  You're right and I should not have tried to project my own values on the world...  that  activity just doesn't make sense.   5. "what determines the value of an activity is totally subjective and relative to the person experiencing the activity, and i certainly do not believe in an absolute category of 'more fulfilling or meaningful' (ie. 'living life') vs. 'less fulfilling or meaningless' (ie. waiting to die)"  I agree there is no absolute category of "more fulfilling or meaningful" but I do believe that the subjective individual will have in them something "more fulfilling or meaningful" for themselves (whatever that is).  This subjective range of value will naturally not map onto everyone else's values in the world.    An interesting question to ask is if given this range of differing values, is there some sort of normative correlation?  I don't know, but it would be interesting if there were consistently some values valued more than others.  I mean, ultimately value assignment is meaningless in an absurd reality where anything goes.  Whatever values that exist only exist because of the human minds that put them there.  A rock doesn't care if it's placed on a pillow or smashed into a billion pieces.  But a human being might.  And because we're each of us human beings, maybe we do share a certain ranged similarity in our value-judgments.  Most of us agree that killing is a bad thing (but not all of us).  A lot of people think that Gay marriage is ok, but some don't.  Some people are conservative and some liberal.  One way of thinking is not necessarily "more right" than the other, but there  are  groups of people who think similarly (that is, they have similar value assignments to their activities in reality).  All I'm saying is that given a vast possibility of differences of subjective worth, it's interesting to note how many of us actually  share  similar values.  This is a total tangent to the main issue... just having a thinklet (brain-fart).   6. "'real being' is found in EVERYTHING an individual does, from watching television, to walking through the woods, to playing a board game, to painting a picture and beyond. if you are limiting yourself, isn't that when you aren't really living?"  Well, I agree that life (real being) is indeed found in  everything  that is experienced in life.  But I'm not so sure if "limiting" experiences is necessarily a bad thing either.  I mean if a certain activity I choose to pursue is one that I place higher value upon, then "limiting" myself by experiencing this activity more than a list of other diverse (but, to me, less valuable/fulfilling) activities I don't think is necessarily "hurting" me.  I agree that I may be missing out on something valuable that I cannot think of.  But I don't agree that I am necessarily missing out.    The way I think we should proceed is to acknowledge that in most circumstances there are a great number of value floating around that we cannot be conscious of (we are just finite beings anyway, not gods).  Given this, how can we make the judgment that some activity is not valuable to us?  We simply don't know.   But  we also  do  know that certain activities  are  valuable to us, and we also shouldn't sluff those activities off in favour of  possibly  valuable activities.  It's all about the balance I think.  Give opportunity to the possible, but balance it with the absolute.  Only in the possible (unknown) can we possibly find newer (better?) value, and in the absolute we will only find what we already know (that which we will eventually get bored of and find less and less valuable, but for the meantime a certainty of value).  So the question is:  are you a radical liberal experimenter?  or a safe conservative?  Nobody is one absolutely, but we are all somewhere inbetween these two absolutes (at least that's what I think so far).  Ok, that's enough for now. Phew!

      i do think there is a difference between activities like watching television and going for a walk in the woods, and i do think the difference comes in with the amount of choices available to the participant, but i don't believe that this creates as vast a distinction as you've outlined; that is; puts these activities into two completely separate and different (opposing) categories. and certainly if these categories DO exist for an individual (that is, this activity makes ME feel like i am truly experiencing life) they do not necessarily apply absolutely to every other individual.  and anyway, if you're walking in the forest and you're heading along a cleared path, isn't your walk already pre-determined by somebody else and the trees and scenery that you see around you already chosen by the people who created the path? and by extension, does that necessarily mean that you would have a more enjoyable or fulfilling walk through the woods if you strayed from the path and walked randomly through the bush, choosing which way you turned? i don't necessarily think so. also, i don't believe playing card/board games is a 'waiting to die' type of activity. i think it's a social pursuit and there is value in that. you may not be creating a masterpiece work of art, but you are interacting with friends and learning and growing in a different way. it is not necessarily a waste of time, because the value is found not in the game itself, but in the social interaction that the game allows for. (my point being, there is something to be gained from ALL experience and the amount to be gained is not directly proportional to the amount of participant interaction or 'free will' required.)  ANY activity you perform, from watching television, to painting a picture are limited in their scope. while it is true that television has fewer options (fewer ways to interact with the activity) painting is also limiting in it's options. you are limited by your skill level, the tools and mediums you are using, etc. what i mean to say is, it is not a limitless life experience. all activities fall somewhere different on the range of participant interaction, and i don't necessarily believe that just because one allows for MORE it is necessarily 'better' or 'more like being true'. i believe each can offer a different opportunity from the total experience of life.  i don't believe that if someone fills their life with less hours of television watching they've necessarily lead a more fulfilling or satisfying life. for the person who thinks looking out the window and thinking is a meaningless pursuit, and would prefer to play a video game, then looking out the window and thinking IS a 'waiting to die' type of activity FOR THEM.   i suppose the disagreement i have is in the 'waiting to die' vs. 'living life' distinction. you say 'living life' activities are 'first-hand experiences', but it seems to me that being a human being that experiences everything first-hand, 'waiting to die' activities (ie. watching television, playing card games) are equally as 'first-hand'. perhaps the rules of the specific activity are derivative (that is, invented by somebody else) but your experience and/or interpretation of them is yours. it IS first-hand. true, 'waiting to die' activities may involve less choice/interaction, but it falls within the same category as 'living life' activities (which are also constrained by rules, perhaps just less so).   basically what i am trying to say in a convoluted kind of way is that everyone differs in their interpretation of what is 'fulfilling'. what kinds of activities they find meaningful enough to pursue. what determines the value of an activity is totally subjective and relative to the person experiencing the activity, and i certainly do not believe in an absolute category of 'more fulfilling or meaningful' (ie. 'living life') vs. 'less fulfilling or meaningless' (ie. waiting to die). here is one example (and my idea is not solely related to intelligence level, just one type of way of illustrating my point): if you're a person with a 180 IQ, your meaningful activities are going to differ from somebody who is developmentally delayed. does that mean a person with diminished faculties is 'waiting to die' when they bounce a ball against a wall because they find it entertaining? just because they are don't find the same type of joy, for example, in writing a complex mathematical thesis? is it also possible that people who cannot find joy in painting, or writing, or thinking AND HAVE 180 IQ's are 'waiting to die' as well? somehow that just doesn't make sense to me. my point is, the same person with an 180 IQ who can easily contemplate the complexities of life, can derive an equal amount of pleasure/fulfillment/satisfaction bouncing a ball against the wall, or watching television, or playing a card game. it IS a different experience, but that's what so great about the TOTAL experience of life, the range of different activities one can participate in. not every activity may be limitless (or offer as many opportunities) in it's options and scope, but the amount of different activities we can choose to involve ourselves in, and thus partake in a full range of human experience, IS what makes one experience life, or allows them to be 'living life'.   i think the distinction between 'waiting to die' vs. 'living life' presents itself not in what activities you necessarily choose (specifics like watching tv vs. painting), but in not allowing yourself to fully engage in all the experiences that are possible, to what is available to you as the individual you are.  'real being' is found in EVERYTHING an individual does, from watching television, to walking through the woods, to playing a board game, to painting a picture and beyond. if you are limiting yourself, isn't that when you aren't really living?

      I think life is found mostly in the moment (that is, in the midst of doing some activity there is real being).  But is being in the middle of experiencing an activity like watching television really living?  What about playing a video game?  What's the difference between painting a picture, walking through the woods, and interacting with artificial devices?  It seems that the difference has to do with will-power.  The fact that the television and the video game and the board game were devised and designed by other people, with all the avenues of choice have already been thought out, seems to make these activities less free than other more general activities.  I mean, in a board game I only have a limited number of choices to make, and whatever choices I do make are already pre-determined by the game designer.  Not that this is a bad thing, just that it gives me an icky feeling knowing that what I'm doing has already been planned by someone else.  That is, that someone else has determined how I should live my life.  That doesn't seem very free or good to me.  Doing things "outside of the box" on the other hand provides for a greater degree of freedom (and consequentially a greater degree of life).  When I paint a picture, there are any number of ways that I could do so, and whatever I do do I will be the one making the decisions.  No one else could have planned or predetermined what it is that I will do.  Whatever I end up with in the end (a masterpiece or a doorstop) is entirely up to me.  This seems more like free choice of will-power.  Being in the midst of doing  this  kind of activity, then, seems more like true being to me.  So I think there is a difference between artificially programmed activities like television, board/card games, and computer entertainment.  These things are more like distractions from life while we wait to die.  Painting, writing, looking out the window and thinking, are more directly involved in life by their freedom of will-power.   Life  to me is experience.  But if what I'm experiencing is programmed by someone else, it seems like a dirrivative (second-order) experience from someone else's direct (first-hand) experience.  It is the first-hand experiences that I'm really looking for.  I don't want to just wait around for something to happen.   I  want to happen!

      Should I spend my life's time trying to understand that life? Or should I go out into the world and simply  live  life? Without understanding, though, how would I know that what I was doing was really living? How could I ever be content with myself, having fun in frivolity, yet never really knowing if I was truly living or wasting my time? But if I work hard, study, learn, open my mind, I may understand more what it means to live here, now, as a human being, but I will not actually be  doing  it. So which is better? Is ignorance really bliss, or an unforeseen torture of the soul (never knowing what it is that tugs at one's inner desires)? Is knowledge worth it? Perhaps.

      Good design, when I see it, does not seem to jump out at me and grab my eye the way good illustration, or good writing does. Good design is merely the  lack  of any misgivings. Good design feels comfortable, nothing more. It does not offend the eye.  Designers must be the unsung heroes of the art community: making all the illustrations, and pieces of writing and photography all look their best, whilst not really drawing attention to their own work. A bad design would be readily recognizable, but a good design is hardly noticed at all; it is simply unconsciously accepted because it does not elicit any ill feelings towards it.   Perhaps there is some difference in modern works (e.g., David Carson) which are designed to be art in and of themselves, regardless of the content they were originally designed to frame.  I guess, then, I would have to consider that sort of piece actual  art  and no longer "just design."  The kind of design I'm talking about here is the kind that takes disparate creative elements of communication and joins them in presentation.  Beyond that and the design becomes one of those disparate elements itself (I think).  What is it about good design which does not necessarily  please  us, but nonetheless does not  dis please us? Why should such a construction of organization and thought not be recognized as more than it is perceived to be? Why is design not just as relevant as any other piece of communicative display?

      Almost every moment that I have to stop and think, I am confronted with my own unwillingness to continue to work. How am I to get over this hump? Is it merely a matter of "will power" and that I just need to force myself? Is it a matter of simply "being in the mood" to do something that I should wait for? Will this "mood" ever come, or am I forever having to grab myself by the collar and drag myself into production, never really hearing my muse?   I believe the latter is the case. I believe that productivity is a result of grit and determination and that these qualities should be placed on a higher pedestal among qualities because they are so rare and hard to come by. Laziness must be the most prolific of qualities, and is also the most useless. We need to be able to overcome our own desires to let life pass us by, and take control of the helm.   It's hard, and it takes effort, and this effort is uncomfortable, but if it is not made then nothing else is going to get done. And with nothing done, at the end of our lives, our one opportunity to play in the "great experience" is lost, never having been truly known (and that is an even greater loss.)

      Is it selfish to kill yourself? Of course, those close to you (friends and family) will miss you and feel sad. Of course, this sadness will be a result of actions that you have taken for your own interests. But what is your life if you cannot make your own choices? How can you say you are in control of your life if you do not have ultimate control over its very existence? Should your friends and family be the ones to have that control over you (that is, because of them you stay alive, not for yourself?)   Besides the problem of freedom, what's the big deal about suicide anyway? If that's what you want to do (if you've had enough of life) why shouldn't you be able to throw in the towel? Some say "no, it's not right" or "people just aren't supposed to kill themselves" like it's some eternally written law that must be followed. I say there are no laws, only conventions.   In life, anything goes. What do you  choose  to do? Choosing an action that does not coincide with whatever laws exist in the place or culture or religion or whatever where the action is made does not necessarily mean that action is  wrong , only that it does not follow those laws. Just because something is a law, also, does not mean that it is  right .   Getting back to the idea of free choices, regardless of laws and cultural opinions, shouldn't your own existence be just that? ...your  own  existence? It may sound selfish, but in this case that's all there is. When it comes down to existence, it's just you (i.e., that thinking, feeling, experiencing, consciousness which perceives the world) and the world (i.e., the earth, the other people on it, and the cosmos beyond: outside).   So, to consider ending your existence, obviously that is going to be a decision about yourself,  for  yourself: a selfish act. But it cannot be anything but a selfish act. Suicide  is  selfish, but is it  wrong ? As I said, I do not believe in right and wrong, only different possibilities. I think that it is crucial. I think that it is fatal. I think that it is ultimate. I think that it is considerable.

      It houses the essence of existence and is the experiential vessel of the soul. Each body is alone to figure out what to do. Each body travels on its own voyage; its own adventure into the unknown. But we each need to try harder. We should do more than just live life, we should try to understand it: that is, we should try to realize the true beauty of creation and (temporal) existence.   There is only the now. We are here, we see, we feel, we think. We enjoy the beauty of the world that created us. We are stardust, but for some reason, manifest as sentient entities (individuals). The matter of the universe can ponder its own existence. Even if we are nothing more than a random swerving of quarks and atoms, we still exist here in this situation.  We still enjoy its beauties and hopes for the future. Being part of a deterministic (or even a random) universe does not take away that beauty.

      Just had an idea on how to distinguish between good and not-so-good art (or anything really.) The idea is that in order for something to be "good" it must be the result of both  effort  and  care . Lacking one of these, and the thing is nothing special. Something that has both effort and care put into it is something valuable.   For instance, a painter could create a piece, spend many hours rendering meticulous textures, but in the end the painting may not be good because the painter did not really care about the painting as a whole. He may not of thought about the composition, or the subject matter and as a result the painting is highly rendered crap. On the other hand, someone might care a lot about art and compositino but is too lazy to actually create something of note. Perhaps another example would be that of the construction worker who exerts much effort into the production of the building, but does not care at all about what it is he is building (at least not nearly as much as the architect who designed it.) Similarly, the architect may care a lot about his design, but will put no effort into its realization. This may be why buildings are not really considered to be "art" in the same sense that paintings are.   An artist who feels passionately for his creation and devotes time and life energy (that is, effort and care) to his project (regardless of what any individual may judge as its aesthetic appeal) is  good  and is  art . I may not appreciate the abstract rendering or the choice of colour but I can appreciate that the painting, no matter what, is something that  meant  something to the artist. It meant so much to the artist that he thought it important enough to devote part of his  life  to creating it, and creating it well and carefully. I think that this sort of effort and care is what makes a thing meaningful and good outside of the realm of composition and rendering and intent. Whatever the artist's reasons, whatever it is that he actually did, this is not what makes it good. What makes it good is that life energy, soul, feeling, love, essence (i.e., that conscious, human, energy that is inside us all to be expressed) and the care to realize that energy. So, Effort + Care = Good.

      Everything can be put into question. But this does not affect anything (e.g., your life and how it is experienced.) Sure, I  could  be just a figment of your imagination (maybe I am just in your mind). Perhaps I am not of the same stuff that you are, but what difference does it make? I am still just as real as anything else in reality!   I don't care if you are real or not, you are still just as interesting (real or unreal) and you are still just as human as the rest of us. Even in the solipsistic universe of ultimate doubt, everyone remains real for what they are. Relativistically speaking, that experience, that world, that hallucination, that dream, whatever it is,  is  what is going on right now.   That which is occurring presently is usually what is dubbed "reality" and the things in it are considered "real." Even if, ultimately, your mind is just a brain in a vat being stimulated by scientists to make you  think  that what you are experiencing is real (even though it is not the ultimate reality) what you are seeing and feeling is, truly what is real for you. That world  does  exist for that time that you are in it. Hallucinations  are  real.   But independent of what is real, is what is interesting. Things that are interesting are things that we  care  about. When I strike up a conversation with my roommate and we talk about the nature of the universe, I find that  interesting , and I value that experience. I value new and relevant thought (but that's just me). And if this is all that reality is, then this is my life, so I'll deal with it. For now, at least, this is all I've got, so I need to figure out what it means to exist in this place, in temporality and then I will understand what it means to be "human" (i.e., a thinking, feeling, experiencing consciousness existing (whatever that  really  means) in  this  reality, interacting with the elements and communicating ideas with other thinking things).   Humanity is the conscious experience, and that is interesting. So regardless of whether or not there truly is some ultimate reality, whether this, in front of us, is real or not, life is still good. What's happening?  I am.  You are.  And we're it's all real.

      Wow, it's four o'clock in the morning, and I am still up. I got about ten hours sleep last night, so that has probably kept me going for most of this time. Do our bodies actually  need  sleep? Isn't regeneration and resting going on throughout the day? Do our  minds  need a rest, a time to simply exist and "cool off?" I don't know really, but I think that it is interesting to think about it.   People seem to get irritated if they miss sleep, but what exactly does it do to us? If I just lay down and rest on the couch and read a book in the "sleeping hours," my body and muscles regain strength and rest that they needed, don't they? What is it about our minds that they need to be turned off from time to time?  I wish I could just stay up my whole life.

      Too many times do I rush into things without first taking the time to think. Walking down the street, always in a hurry, I don't take the time to relax, enjoy my walk, and look around me. Speaking, I don't take my time to tell the story and process each word (many times I find myself almost mumbling because I am going through a sentence in my head faster than my mouth can say it). Any decisions I make, whether in chess or in life, I must learn to wait, think about different possibilities and consider all consequences before rushing and semi-blindly choosing, not being aware of any possible better choice. Slow and steady wins the race I truly believe.

      Is it worth it to live in Toronto? Should I move back home with my parents for the next year until I get my feet on the ground? Or should I take a bit of a risk, have a little fun, and make it on my own? I'd be with my friends, but I wouldn't make as much money. I'd have more opportunities for work and pleasure, but it would be harder. If I go home, I'd eat better, I'd have security, and I'd save a lot more money. Is that really worth it? What am I turning into? Is money all that is important to me now? Even if it is to save for a good goal (going back to school) is that really worth my  life ? I think I should earn a little bit less money and actually do some living and experiencing. One good experience has got to be worth more than anything money can provide for me. So I think I've made up my mind, and I'm going to move to TO and work hard, and have fun. ;+}

      I mean, it seems like such a waste of time to me. Is anything  really  learned from it? Sure, you can watch the News and find out what's happening around you in the world, but beyond such simple awareness, what real benefit does television have to offer? Entertainment? But this is just the problem isn't it? It is  too  entertaining. We get sucked into staring at the box for hours on end and never get anything done. I believe that there are other forms of entertainment which can be had which allow for greater usefulness (e.g., reading). If only we could all just put down the petty distractions and really concentrate on important things: things with meat on them (e.g., artwork, thinking, opening our minds to possibilities, understanding who we are and what we want). We only have a small amount of time in this world, we shouldn't waste it distracting ourselves from it.

      I do not wish to smack the viewer of a work of art over the head with its meaning. Artwork that can be read in a split-second (e.g., illustrations, posters, or ads) are of little interest and become boring very quickly (and can, on occasion, be quite insulting to the viewer's intelligence). I would rather create a work of art in such a manner that I am able to lead the viewer up to the curtain of the imagination's stage, but let  the viewer  peer through him/herself. Different viewers may perceive different interpretations (that is, see different things on the other side of the curtain) but whatever is seen,  that  is the meaning of the piece. I'm not revealing the meaning myself (that is, I have  my own  view of the piece) but that is not to say that what I see on the other side of the curtain, is what you should see. The enjoyment and the beauty comes from the individual's understanding and realization as the viewer, not the absolute dictatorial stampings of the artist.

      It felt like I had been moping around, depressed and bored all my life and that I had just woken up and realized what life was really about; that life was good and that I had just not realized it before; that there was still hope in life, even though it was meaningless.  It didn't matter that there was no meaning because it was good.    We are only phenomenal beings, existing in a sensual world, experiencing the unexpereienced and enjoying it for what it is.  There is no understanding, only feeling.

      Consciousness is useful when sickness increases in the body. As the malady rises to the level of consciousness where the self becomes aware that there is something wrong, internally, with the body, higher level cognitive thought comes into play in order execute procedures to alleviate the sickness. That is, instead of continuing to roam about looking for food, shelter, and sex, these "normal" everyday behaviours are overridden by consciousness to enact different, sickness-prevention behaviour, in order to ensure the survival of illness as a new priority. If we were not aware of such ensuing illness, and continued with our normal routines, perhaps the sickness would kill us. Even worse, we would spread said illness to the rest of the group, diminishing the survival of the species as a whole. Consciousness can thus be very useful.

      We've come along way from our beginnings in the hunt. We came back to our caves and painted on the walls with charcoal and vegetable dyes. We marked the physical reality which existed around us to notify all cognitive matter that "Here I am!" Here, where any creative mind could understand it, lay the efforts (the life struggle) and the anguish of another adventurer of that realm beyond the limits of space and time. And yet, as we look upon those beauties of the past, some of us adding our own tales to that great novel of consciousness, most of us are reluctant to leave the cave at all. We are so captivated by our own generative possibilities that we no longer care to experience that unpredictable, scary, misunderstood, world outside. We all seem to be lost in our own self-fulfillment.

      Our western society seems to be based upon a system of fear. Most prevalent is its presence in the insurance industry. We're afraid of hurting ourselves, of hurting others, of others hurting themselves and trying to hurt us in retaliation. We're afraid of thieves in the night. We're afraid of crashing our cars. We're afraid of an act of God destroying our homes. And the insurance companies are cashing in on all this fear. What's there to be afraid of? We're alive, we're healthy, and able to do anything our minds desire. Just fucking live your life! Stop bothering the rest of us with your whining, and move on. What happens in the past is unimportant, especially considering that there is no reason for it in the first place.

      Feeling the emotional turmoil of misunderstanding the perceptual reality around me, I find myself awestruck by the wonderment of the vastness of qualia that insights itself upon my awareness.  or  The universal mechanism of deterministic results, is plodding through space and time, to unknown ends, loosing order and gaining complexities, understanding itself in degrees towards its final oblivion.   Many times upon greeting a friend, the question is asked, but is it really considered?  What  is  going on?  I truly do not know.  How could any finite existence ultimately comprehend the grandeur of our world?  But does this mean that we should just ignore the question, and its possible answers?  Ignorance can be bliss.  But I believe that understanding is a thing of beauty.

      Why is there such resistance out there towards digital artwork? People say it isn't "real" or that it doesn't convey the same  emotions  and that it isn't  art . A painting (with paint) is simply a splash of colours across a two dimensional plane which impacts the viewer's visual field of perception by light reflecting off its surface. I think that the same results can be achieved in this sense whether the "art" be a computer print-off or a canvas with paint. The image in front of the viewer can still be  beautiful .  There is a sort of distancing from the viewer and the artist with a print-out. The artist himself didn't  touch  or take  care  with this particular printoff the same way he would a painting. But does this minor aspect of the difference really matter in the grand scheme of things? Can't we still enjoy the visual perception for what it is (i.e., a projection of light and colour upon our retinas?)  I think that using the computer to aid me in the creation of my art is indispensable in the achievement of certain effects that would be ludicrously difficult had I attempted them by hand (let alone the difficulty of imagining such effects in the first place.) There are certain things that the computer can do better (faster, more colourful, more precise) than what can be done by hand. But inversely, there are certain things that can be done by hand that would take a lot longer to do on the computer, so it makes sense to do them traditionally (e.g., sketching, paint textures, ink effects, paper granulate, expressive brush strokes, collage, linears, etc.) There are certain art-generating procedures which are done better by hand as well as others which are done better in the computer.  I think that the future of two-dimensional art lies in the new technologies (i.e., the new tools) that become available to the artist to use. To ignore them, to ridicule them as  cheating , to look down upon them as "just using a filter" and having no artistic merit, is simply being ignorant to the changes that have taken place in the world. If you were out hunting for food out on the plain, why would you use a spear when you have a rifle readily available to you? Why walk 100 kilometers to visit your friend when you can take a train? Why spend six months painting a canvas, when you can achieve all the same artistic desires in two days on the computer (freeing you up to create more images, and express yourself to a greater degree to the art world?)  We learn from experience. The first painting I did was not as good as the second. The more images I create, the more I learn about colour, composition, aesthetics, beauty, expression, and what it is that I want to show the rest of the humanity. The more images I can create, more quickly, the greater the speed at which I can learn these values, and the quicker I can reach my vision and achieve my goals. If it takes me six months to do a single painting, my learning curve would be a lot more flat, and my dreams would linger in the distance waiting patiently for me to catch up.  The computer is a tool, like any paint brush, pigment, or canvas. What you do with it is what makes the results artwork. As yet, there is no magic button that creates a finished piece of art on demand. To produce something of beauty still requires the involvement of an artistic intellect, and the judgements of a creative mind. The end-result of such a mind's exertions is nothing less than  art . If the day comes when the computer can produce an original artwork of its own volition, then that would still not make the product  not  art, it would simply mean that the computer had become an intelligent mind of its own and would be equal to all other sentient life.  Digital painting does not mean fake painting. Physical painting does not mean it is necessarily artwork. Beauty = Art. That's all there is to it.

      It is interesting how much the human psyche is affected by something as simple as luminance. I remember one day after the winter, the sun came out in the morning and the day was hot and dry. The warm breezes allowed me to venture outdoors in only shirt and shorts, and I enjoyed myself abundantly. The following day, the temperature dropped back down to winter degrees, clouds formed, and the entire day was dark and dreary. I noticed, upon reflection, that I had been more depressed and easily angered that day. Two completely opposite days, and two completely opposite personalities! There is more than heredity and cognitive experience which affects who we are. The environment itself (directly) modifies who we are and what we do. The planet Earth is one big chain-reaction of energy (life) that is interrelated in all its complexities to the rest of the universe. The universe is the absolute whole, and everything inside it depends upon everything else.

      Now that I've found myself a job in the big city, and my debts are almost paid back, I can sit back and relax a bit. Funny how when it comes down to it, we're all governed by that green paper eh? Today I spent all the daylight hours editing some old stories and trying to figure out what I want to be doing. I thought about working on a painting, but I just didn't feel like it. I don't know why. What is it that drives us to do the things we do (or lack of things?) I find it so hard to motivate myself to actually  do  something! But at my job, when other people's expectations and hopes depend upon me directly I am quite motivated and work hard. But when I'm all by myself, with no one's expectations but my own to contend with, I find myself working less and I am more easily tempted by laziness. How can I get myself out of this cycle? How can I motivate myself the same way that I am whilst at my day job? I'm not sure yet, but I keep forcing myself to push forth and do things on my own.  I don't like having to force myself this way. It should just come naturally shouldn't it?

      Reading Kundura's  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  I found it interesting what he considered the true feeling behind vertigo: that it is not a fear of heights, but a dilemma of choosing not to dive right into them. Always being aware of our own mortality, our existential curiosities must be curbed to our desire for perseverance. Vertigo is the knowledge of that ultimate realization of our own limited frailties in the presence of the grandness of the universe and its possibilities.

      I've come to believe strongly in enjoying new experiences whatever form they take. I'm interested in learning about the world (i.e., reality) and looking for those aspects of it which I have not yet come to understand. What I'm looking for is beauty, and a lot of that beauty, I have discovered, resides in my own imagination. I believe strongly in the exploration of all forms of all possible experiences, bar none. When it comes time for me to turn in, I'll enjoy that one last experience of transitivity to oblivion.

      So maybe consciousness is not the whole mind, but only a certain "judgement" aspect of what constitutes it. Memory is probably another, non-conscious, part of the mind, storing certain experiences and judgements in representational form. The consciousness can then analyze (or judge) what experiences have been had by looking into the memory. Imagination, then, is the recombinatorial abilities of the consciousness to analyze aspects of varying memories and reintegrate them in unseen feedback experiences.

      The unconscious mentations of brain activity, causing bodily actions independent of sentient cognition, are non-representational mental states (may even be non-mental states) which operate outside of freedom of choice following the rules of deterministic reality in a manner that is not affected by any mind. That is not to say that the mind is not privy to such cause and effect, but that even within this structure it is still free to choose:  free to create mental states which themselves are free to represent any possible phenomenal experience. We are both free and bound; awake and asleep. What a confusing thing human beings have ultimately become!

      It seems that one of the reasons we became so intelligent is because of movement.  That is, we have the ability to move from place to place and converse with other intelligences, and learn things and experience new sensations which could not have been had from our origin. Plants can't move around and so they're stuck at their origin. They have limited opportunities to gain new knowledge and so have not developed into species of intelligence (they were precursor/prototypes for animal life which became sentient).  Humans could be thought of as an advanced, experimental program which has become aware of its own design and place in the network (i.e., reality). A new way of thinking about life, religion, etc.:  we are all of us special, special programs that have become aware of themselves... but we are unable to realize the realms beyond our limited understanding... we can't see “out” into the world beyond, the world that encapsulates this world... we could possibly all be in a sort of matrix and we don't know it... we could all be fledgling AI's and not even know it...  there is no difference between “artificial” intelligence and “normal” intelligence... in the end, they're both intelligent.  What we need to realize is that it doesn't matter that we're “artificial” or “normal”, “matrix” or “reality” because what we see before us (that is, what we are experiencing right here and now) is all that we can possibly hope for and can possibly experience.  This thing, this reality, is where we are (mentally) regardless of any “higher” realizations, at THIS moment, we are all children of THIS reality, and that's all that matters... who cares if it's fake, it's real... what more do you want?    Enjoy what you've got, cuz there ain't much more than what you see.

      It doesn't matter what we do as long as we do it: as long as we live. The more exciting the experience, the more life we are able to feel. And we end up wanting more of it.  Where we see it we desire it.  Life is a thing of motion and change (to stand still is the same as to die). We are addicted to virtual reality.

      Love seems to me to be such a waste of time and resources:  buying gifts, good clothes, movie tickets, nice smelling perfumes.  You must spend time doing things which you do not always enjoy, in an attempt to keep the other person happy.  When you subtract all this from the money and time that you have  already  invested in school or job, there is not very much left-over for little, old  you !  And what's the point of life anyway?  Just to go out, find a mate, create more living beings so that  they  can wonder the same sorts of things?  Is it to merely be happy, taking pleasure from the one that we love?  Or should we just forget about it (i.e., love, copulation, etc.) and try to work out some of these problems/questions (besides, there are billions of other people loving and copulating, so it's not as if the human race is at risk of extinction or anything)?  Here, in Canada, we have got the education, food, time and freedom to devote to serious stuff like life, the universe and everything.  Why not take advantage of this freedom?  Why must we be like everyone else (and every animal for that matter) on Earth?  Now, of course, becoming an illustrator is not  exactly  a road to fulfillment, but it can provide  some  resolution of the problems and it can also provide food and shelter (primary needs) and allow some fun at the same time.  With the time that is left after doing this job (an illustrator doesn't work from nine until five) you could focus some attention on the deeper aspects of our predicament here (secondary needs), on this planet, in this universe, in this particular reality (if any of it even  is  real ;-).  So, we should abandon love and use our limited time on Earth more wisely, if for no other reason than to simply understand  why  we are here in the first place. Of course, if, in the end, we find that love is a good enough reason to exist, then maybe it will be found that all this effort was futile from the get-go.  What  does  love have to do with it?

      We are becoming masters of our own realities.  We are beginning to be able to make devices that allow us to experience things not able to be experienced in real life.  Through such mediums as music (sound) movies (sight) gourmet (taste) and perfume (smell) and virtual reality in any sense of the word (cognition)  we are beginning to allow ourselves to experience new experiences that were before unknown.  I believe that at this point in time, the "movie" format is the most highly advanced method of experiencing an alternate reality.  It is just on the verge of creating a dream inside our minds.  Even as one becomes wrapped-up in the movie whilst watching it, one forgets about the other world with a body sitting in a theater and plays the role of god looking down upon the different occurrences of some other reality:  to watch the events unfold and play out.  Perhaps as we begin to interface our minds more and more we will be able to actual affect those events through actual participation in them with ourselves... that is we can become one of the movie characters and make decisions in that world.  What then would be reality?    In this completely entrenched fake world, we would be allowed to experience even more diverse experiences as they would not be limited to what we have already experienced.  Now this is not to say that the total possible set of experiences is any greater than that set in the real world, but only that a different set of  circumstances  would be  possible  in this alternate reality, allowing the participant in that reality the  opportunity  to experience different parts of reality that would be otherwise unexperienceable.  It's all the same reality, only from different perspectives, and these virtual reality machines allow us to look at ourselves from different angles and experience a greater range of this reality; to see a greater degree of beauty (along with it great disparity, making the beautiful all the more great, only because that which we would label as least beautiful is simply what we call most hideous).  Movies are our link into this ability to perceive more of our realities, and this is the reason that I wish to be able to create with my own hands the opportunities for others to really see how messed up this reality of ours really is.  I hold the ability to create realities.  It is almost like playing God, creating the experiences that these other minds will learn.     On another note, the human body is just a big lump of stuff trying to interact with some outside reality.  All our senses are but different aspects of the same thing outside in reality.  Our minds experience this reality only through the senses such that we never experience the  realness  of reality, but only certain aspects of it.  We can see a car, hear it go by, feel the wind of its movement, and smell its exhaust, tasting the smog.  But there are so many other manners in which to experience this thing that was out there in reality which created the experience of all these sensations.  Infrared, bat sonar, etc. are things we cannot experience, parts of reality which are locked from us.  And what other possible ways could we experience that outside world?  Would it be possible to create a device that could "sense" reality in a different way (radar for example) and could this radar device have its inputs stimulate a  part of the brain such that all the radar "blips" signaled neurons in the brain?  Would we eventually be able to "understand" these blips, and as such "see" with radar?  That is to say, could we ADD experiences to our minds by thinking of new ways to sense it?  This could be the  opposite  of virtual reality, that is,  ultra  reality in the sense that we are  adding  even more of what is really there to your mind!

      Is there anything for which we are motivated to take part in which is not the result of some survival instinct?  We reproduce and have children in the hopes that our offspring will continue to live and have offspring of their own. In this way, we are able to survive beyond our personal life spans. Our genetic code, our teachings and ideas are passed on into a newer life which will be able to continue living and cycle life again and again.  When we paint, we are expressing inner emotions and ideas, solidifying them in a more permanent medium which will live on after we are gone, and continue to portray the sorts of mental activity that we had when we were alive. In effect, the painting will continue to implant in the minds that look at it those same sorts of emotions. So our ideas and emotions will have the opportunity to continue living (i.e., existing) after we are no longer.  Same with writing. Every writer hopes that his great work will continue to be published and people will read it for centuries to come. The author's name will be remembered, the ideas will continue to be learned and understood. The writer's mind (i.e., those aspects of it which were most important... the ones that were good enough to be written down) will continue to live on.  We may do other activities in life which are not directly related to the survival of the self, but ultimately, the underlying motivation for anything that we do is the motivation to continue to live.  My question is this: what's the point of living in the first place? Why survive, if we don't even know why we're living?  Sure we might have good experiences along the way, but even these feelings of goodness are a product of our ingrained survival wantingness. Sex feels good because we are so strongly programmed to survive. Our brains have been setup in such a way that the physical act of surviving feels good to us, and thus conditions us to appreciate the feeling of it. All other good feelings could be said to be derived from this most basic good feeling (e.g., art feels good after having created it, it being like the creation of more offspring, same with writing... drugs act directly on those parts of the body which were developed for instilling the good feelings of reproduction).  If everything good about living is good simply to allow for us to continue living, why are we living in the first place? I mean its good to have a good thing continue, but why should it?  I don't know. And I may never know. But that is the ultimate question. However, I have still to understand in what way the *answer* to the ultimate question relates (i.e., 42).

      I was sitting on my couch looking out the window today and, starring at the hydro cables dangling between poles across the street, I thought it interesting how much we have connected ourselves together. All over the planet, we have wires running around, caring energy and information, linking intelligence together to create some new form of consciousness not even realizable by us. Could the "world" be thinking things, realizing things, that we individual human beings cannot fathom?  High voltage electricity wires seem like veins, providing energy to the system. Telephone and internet connectivity seems like a nervous system, connecting information together (and the minds at either end of those wires). It seems to me like the whole world is connected together in a system of information organization. Each of our individual minds are like nodes of this immensely parallel network. We each do our own little bits of thinking, or processing the information we gather, and then we share it with the rest of the network via telecommunications, and simple verbal communication.  And on top of that, we are literally the eyes and ears of the system sensing the world, but the central processing of all that data is done by the network as a whole (like individual neurons, we each have our own "states" of understanding, and connected to the rest of the network, we share these states with the other "neurons" spreading general understanding). How much has Humanity as a whole come to know. How will Earth see itself in the universe? Even though we are ourselves consciously aware, does this disclude the possibility of another, bigger, consciousness being realized as a combination of us?  If our blood cells were conscious, would they be aware of the bigger system that they were a part of? Would they care?  We're all connected. What does it mean?

      What happens (art) is not what has already happened (history) or what will possibly happen (philosophy). That is to say, art is the representation of what is going on in reality right here and now. It is our connection between the world and our minds.

      Poets are like our guides through thought. S/he says think of  this , and then after that, think of  this ! Leading listeners through a series of concepts and ideas wherein the sequence itself is beautiful and is what we admire.  Ideas are beautiful, but a  set  of ideas can be beautiful in a different way.  Break down the meanings, to a bare minimum. Think  bird , then think  sun , then think  dawn ,  warm ,  purple ,  blue ,  pink ,  orange  and the beautiful picture of a bird on the backdrop of a sunset gliding through dusk's air impacts consciousness. The list of concepts is a map leading the way from point A (starting ideas) to point B (after understanding the sequence). Poets are painters of mental experience.

      The most enjoyment that I have found in life has existed in the midst of novel phenomenal experience. But I am a finite creature, and as such can only experience a limited set of possible phenomena. What if I could create another consciousness that could break free of my own limitations?  To reproduce is not only so that a part of you will *survive*, but so that a part of you can survive to have all the virgin experiences that you were able to enjoy *again* as if they were new once more. As you approach the end of your life there remain few new experiences left to have (you have already done most of them) and as such, to have a part of what made you, live on in another "you" and be able to have those experiences anew, is pleasing to know and understand. Even though it may simply be your genetic code (and only part of it at that) that will continue, it was part of that which created your soul (i.e., your mind/whatever) and this is what you want to have had all those experiences again. So you have the ability to let your mind be innocent to the world once again, and experience all those experiences again (only a little bit differently, as it is mixed with another's genes as well (it would be fun to just experience the world pretty much the same way each time such as would be with cloning) but to do it all again) but different still such that it is even new for that part of you that is living on. Reproduction is the unconscious altering of the mind to see reality from an even different perspective. Evolution is natural reality altering perception in the attempt to "see" more of what we are living in, to understand what it is that surrounds our minds. What is this place in the mists that I see everywhere I look?  We have now developed, naturally, to the point where we can now take conscious control over the development of our reality altering growth (e.g., cybernetics, artificial intelligence, robotics, genetic engineering, etc.). We can "add" parts/senses to ourselves and experience more of what we are existing in. We can create new minds, in our own image, to go out into the universe and have experiences that we cannot even comprehend. Maybe God wasn't some super being that had a master plan for everything, but was simply one of our ancestors who wanted to give birth to a new consciousness that could see in the dark that which He could not.

      It's funny how each of us are all desperate to experience new, creative content. I stare at my TV screen all night, checking all the channels for something that interests me; for something that will satisfy my longing desire to realize something different (something better than the wall behind the TV).  I see first-run movies for the same reason. I can't wait for them to come out on video (or even for bootlegs to propagate over the internet). I buy hardcover books, I check websites daily to determine if anything new has occurred in the greater world, I buy video games when they are priced high instead of waiting for them to become old and cheaper in average value, and I scramble to the music store to unwrap and upload the latest Radiohead CD into my mind. I am itching for something different in my life. I must be unsatisfied: I look outward for something to satisfy my urges. It would be so easy to simply abuse the chemical composition of my being (athletics, food, drugs, religion), having my sense of satisfaction applied directly sans content. Is this sense of fulfillment, found in the experience of new "interesting" things, really all that drives us?  I'm an artist, and I  create  things. But is this only because I have found that I am better able to satisfy my internal desires by feeding myself my own content? I create art, not for others, not for sale, not to "live" through commercial exchange and satisfaction of primary needs. I do it only because of my own, selfish desire to experience something I've never seen before, something I like, something that only  I  can bring into existence with my own two hands. Art is a sophisticated form of masturbation. It seems we're only concerned with having our next orgasm.

      I want to express in my paintings a  sense  of the beautiful, not the beauty itself. Each of us individually contains some idea of "beauty" and by allowing the  viewer  to fill the gap between "almost sensible" and "conscious visual experience" I believe I can give each person a hand in the creation of that final wonderment. And giving other people the chance to share a bit in the joy that the artist has in  creation  can provide a more substantial sense of enjoyment. I believe that this is a good way to share our (artists) artistic sense of experience with other consciousnesses of different awareness. Maybe this way we can understand each other a little more.

      Many people seem to have similar ideas but express them in different ways using slightly different terms resulting in some confusion and argument when in actuality there is none. For example, I might say "mind" where another person might say "soul" and we might be confused over the differences between a religious spirit versus a physical brain when in fact we are referring to the same existential phenomenon. I think the problem has to do with language. Maybe we just have too many overlapping meanings.

      So we're like all controlled by time. I mean we exist in space  and  time, but we seem overly concerned with the time aspect of it. We have clocks on the walls, clocks on our bodies, clocks in our cars, clocks on our buildings, clocks on our computers, clocks built into our phones: they are in everything we do in our daily lives. Again, as with most of my opinions, who cares? When you're done sleeping, you should wake up. When you're hungry, you should eat. When you want to go work on something, then go work on it. When you're tired, go to sleep! Do we really need to play this game of temporal synchronization and punch-clock slavery? We do it to ourselves. And we don't have to. Take off your watch, and go play in the sun. Stop worshiping to false gods ; )

      1.  Unknown Novelty  (new experiences are interesting; new realizations; new order from chaos; new understanding from the unknown; knowledge (in the broad sense) is beautiful; the unknown is both interesting for its potential and dangerous for its possibilities (survival-wise))  2.  Effort and Care (any artifact which has had a portion of a mind's life devoted to it carries with it a certain aura of beauty; that another mind has *cared* about this thing makes it worth something; in other words, *life* is represented in the artwork)**  3.  Immortality and Communication  (all artwork is, in essence, a form of communication; it is the linking of two minds such that the physical representations in one mind are partially (intentionally fully) mapped onto another mind; the viewer/reader/listener "sees" what the artists sees; this sharing of understanding is beautiful)  4.  Freedom  (beauty and art are forms of free will and demonstrate the blazing of new trails and new frontiers; freedom to do more than what already is can be beautiful)  5.  Sensation  (all that we are is a set of senses (and the awareness of these senses) moving around in reality and experiencing aspects of it; we are blobs of existence floating in space and time)

      I don't want to take medication to alter my feelings (e.g., to curb my depression) because even if they do not hinder my cognition, they may affect my inspiration. Drugs may very well make the blade of my life stronger, but I am more interested in it being  sharp  to slice through existential frustrations more directly. I want to plunge myself right into the middle of the problems and not stand to the side and look at them from safety. I think that anything special that is to happen has associated with it a certain degree of risk. It is this risk that I will take, sans medication, and hopefully I will arrive at the end of my life with a better understanding of it (not simply blind enjoyment).

      Beauty is a  set  of ideas (or a certain neurological  state ) such that the thinker has certain beliefs about the world that facilitate an admiration for some aspect of it. It involves life (the energy and existence that the thinker puts into thinking about this particular aspect of the world) but it also hinges on the delicacy of the idea itself. If the idea is lost (here I use 'lost' more generally to include "loss of belief") then the beauty is lost as well. So in the parable, when the man learned that the stone was simply a reject of some mediocre craftsman, the  idea  of it having been created "naturally" is lost because he can no longer believe in its authenticity. It is not the stone itself which is beautiful, but the  idea  that the thinker had associated with it.

      We see beautiful things and we want to be able to show the other selves how nice it is. We understand each other that it is extremely difficult to really connect with one another, to really  know  what the other is feeling/experiencing. We are all alone in this way, cut off from one another at the experiential level. We may paint pictures, write books, concoct new words, join and rejoin semantics, by sound, sight, touch, taste, and smell. We will use whatever tools are available for us to attempt to replicate the sort of experience that we had in that beautiful moment so that we can share the happiness that it had brought us. We know from our own experience how sad it can be sometimes not being able to have beautiful experiences. We know that it would have been great if someone else could have shared their beautiful experience with us at that time of depression. And so we try, by all means possible to express our own inner beauties to all that are seeking something to embrace. For all those who are lost in a sea of decay, we will show the world in a new light. Things change, and don't always have to be so alone. We can share our wonderful thoughts with each other.

      So, we're all God.  We are all creators. We have our own creative minds and have the freedom to do anything that we want to do. Life is the freedom for particulate matter to consciously choose what it  wants  to do.  Imagine the essence of the universe itself just waking up one day and  deciding  to fucking  do  stuff. And what stuff do we (i.e., the matter) do? We  organize  ourselves (that is, the matter; the stuff that we are made of).  Life (and mentality in general) seems to be the organizations and complexities of  heated matter. We are all born of fire and we want to stay warm. The only way to stay warm is to create more heat, and in this cooling universe, so long after the initial, massive coalescence, we need to rearrange the matter and heat what is left to preserve it.  There is a certain constant set of energy (heat) in the universe which is evening out due to entropy, but perhaps with our conscious minds we can grab some of that stale heat and rub it together and create hotter centers, more excited matter, more  life  (life being a very complex organization of heat).  Love is the pleasure of keeping warm. Life is heat. As a survival trait, it naturally feels good to be warm (i.e., to be alive). So, the vibrating molecules and their organization is what matters because that's what life  is !  Life is heat. Heat is the vibration of molecules (crudely speaking). Love is the attraction of the actual molecules. It is  completely  unconscious. None of it matter to anything because it's just matter. Matter matters. That's all there is.  At a higher level of abstraction and organization, there is just more heat. We expend great amounts of energy to organize and reorganize symbols (e.g., language is an organization of symbolic representation for reality, painting is the symbol of experience, writing is a great organization of letters and language and ideas); all of which is the production of heat (which feels good) and because we are alive. Being alive means vibrating more molecules.  We are everlasting fire.  We are all God.

      What are memories? All that is living is  now , but we are able to consider in the movie screen of our mind's eye past nows that are no longer now. Isn't this strange? Did those other nows really happen? I don't know, because all I have to judge is  now . What if I only just came into existence and all those memories were just set up in the initial state such that I  think  they happened, and they  feel  like they happened, when in fact they really didn't? Am I really the set of all these memories, then, or the thinking consciousness that is thinking  about  the memories right here and now?

      Two sets of gases side by side. One hotter than the other. The two mix together and evenly distribute the overall heat. On its own, the heated matter is irreversibly cooled (overall), and evened out.  But life is different and can stand outside the entropic principle. The entropy *can* be reversed through conscious intervention. Life itself can *decide* to move about, rub two sticks together and create fire. We can love, and create more life, and spread that life across the universe. The life itself is organized and hotter than the simple gases on their own. Consciousness can hold the universe together and keep it from fading away. With effort, we can keep the world special.

      Two possible ways of achieving artistic freedom.   One  Personal freedom.  Work on your own. Save up some money. And when you have enough, take a whole fucking year off. Pay your bills with the money you've saved, quit your job, and just fucking do whatever you want! Go sit on a mountain and think. Hike through the forest. Write a book. Paint and painting. Chill out. Create. Live.   Two  Work together with other artists.   Be each other's muses. Inspiration. Rotate freedom. Say, four of the artists work and help support the fifth artist to be free and create something special. After a time, the freedom will rotate and it will be one of the other artist's turns to create something special. During these periods of freedom, the artist will not have to worry about anything except his/her artwork.

      To die or not to die, that is the question...  Suicide is all about the trouble with life. I mean, when it comes down to it, what's the point of living at all in the first place? To do great things? To be happy? To love? To live as long as possible? I honestly don't know and I don't think anybody else does either. Life only means whatever you want it to mean, and so if it doesn't mean anything to you...  Yeah, I don't see why suicide always has to be a negative thing. If you're done with your life, what's wrong with simply putting it away? One prevailing theme in people's lives seems to be hope: we think about what  could  be over that next hill; of possible treasures that could still await us. If you've already experienced all the great stuff you were looking/hoping for, then what's left to do? Why not see what's over that last, ultimate hill, and move into the abyss?  I've grappled with all these suicidal thoughts a lot myself and my problem is that I have no good reason to live, but I also don't have any good reason to die. Either option is just as pointless (in the grand, philosophical scheme of things).  I've got this conscious existence, this continuous experience of stuff (of feelings and symbols and memories and thoughts... how psychotic!) and so, like, what the fuck? Why is this all happening and what am I supposed to do with it? I didn't ask for this to happen. I'm here, now, and I simply don't know (if knowing is something you believe in) what's going on!  As a result, I've fallen into artistry, self-expression, documenting what I (at least) think about this messed up reality so maybe somebody else (including myself) can make use of it. I know there are other conscious beings out there (I've spoken with a few of them and I appreciate it when they share some of their own experience with me to add to the tangle of awareness I've got going on in my own head). Sometimes just knowing that you're not alone is enough. We're all in this together. But if you've had enough, by all means don't let anyone stop you. Who's life is it anyway, right?  I wish society was different, I wish people noticed me and appreciated what I do (e.g., artwork) but it isn't, and they don't. It doesn't matter to me anyway because the whole thing doesn't matter in the first place! We live our lives (we ride our rides) and enjoy the good times and despair the bad.... and then we die. Whether it be by your own hand or as a result of some external force, when you're dead, you're dead, and that was your time to die. Thinking about what could have been (or worse, what  should  have been) is just as meaningless as what  is .  I don't mean to sound insincere (I have a number of people I love myself and would dread seeing them cease to be) but when it's someone's time, that's it: time to die. You shouldn't feel bad or sorry or whatever, because oblivion is simply the definition of a person's life (well, maybe not the definition, but it at least marks the  end  of the definition by stamping a period after it).  If you've had enough of the rat-race then die, if you're still hopeful then stick around and see what happens next, or if you're like me, you can float around in the middle and just watch it all go down. Life's an orphaned bitch that doesn't even know who her mother was.  That's all I've got to say. Take it or leave it.

      Where have all the rainbows gone? Where did the magic go? When did everything get so serious?   I don't think I like knowing all this shit that's inside my head, or being able to do "higher order thought."  It seemed better when I was just stupid and innocent, playing in the backyard in my sandbox and building imaginary army bases with my Lego collection. I feel I was happier not knowing what was going on out in the world (that is, when "the world" was just the world inside my own head).   But I'm able to do bigger things, to express myself more thoroughly, now. I can plan more exactly how to achieve whatever I want to achieve. But what if what I want to achieve is my return to childhood play, to forget about the world, and to be one again with my own existence: what made sense. What does that mean? Do I just desire that which I can never have? Do I yearn for the unattainable? What's my problem? Maybe I set my goals to high.

      Client codes, serial numbers, activation keys, expire dates, decoders, licenses, where does it end? When I buy a piece of software, I want to actually use it! I'm the one paying for it; shouldn't I be the one to make demands about how I use it instead of letting big business dictate to me what my user experience should be like?   I know, I know... without all this added security and activation and registration, people would just rip off the programs and anybody could use it without paying for it. True. But if I do pay for it, I don't want to feel like a criminal. I don't know what the solution is, but all these passwords and endless codes are not working. Something else needs to be done. Maybe we all just need to adopt the open source model to make users happy? At least that cuts through all the red-tape bullshit and users can get down to business.  Something needs to change.

      I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of beauty and aesthetics today. I want to do all the learning that I can to get a base idea of what has already been accomplished and use that as leverage to add something truly original to the literature.  There seems to be a lot of scattered ideas at the moment. Many writers concentrate on specific problems and not much has been done on any kind of large unifying theory. What does art mean in general? What is beauty? What is value? How do the answers to these questions relate to oneanother? Why are these questions important to human existence? This is what I am interested in exploring.  But what can I say about these problems right now? I believe that art, and beauty in general, are valuable courses of study because they hit upon areas of thought that seem to hold answers to the mystery of human existence (e.g., what are we doing here? What's the point of it all? What does it mean to live a life?)   With what I know so far about humanity's work, it seems to be endlessly searching for these answers in everything that it does. In science, we are trying to find answers to explain the physical phenomena that occur outside of our bodies. Theologians are trying to understand our relationship with that which created us (e.g., God). Mathematicians try to understand abstract logical analyses as something fundamental to conscious reasoning. Artists look for the ultimate experience, or beauty. Historians try to make sense of the long list of achievements that we have already accomplished to relate to the problems of today. And the literatii attempt an explanation of the human condition through (non)fictional examples in writing (i.e., thought experiments). In each case there is a search for some ultimate explanation/experience which will make more sense of our human condition here on Earth.  Now, from what I can tell (with my limited experience) I think that the place to look for this most abstract explanation of humanity can most distinctly be found in the study of Aesthetics. Not that Aesthetics itself has the answers, but that it follows more closely the questions of value. That is, what is it that is important to each of us in our limited existences?  Some say it's just to have fun (pleasure), others to create a great work worthy of addition to the great human verse, others that we should prepare ourselves for our next lives. I think each of these things can fall under the category of "beauty." In other words, what we want or what we find important is beauty. Now you might say that scientific analysis or economical progress is more important, but what is it, at the end, that these activities aim for? In a broad sense, a better explanation about the physical world will reveal to us its organization and structure (or its beauty). Economic gain, in my opinion, is just another means to an end (to provide us the time and resources necessary to continue the ultimate search).   Why are we here? What is the point of living as opposed to dying (wouldn't committing suicide be a lot less work)? I think that only the beauty of life can provide any kind of meaning to these questions. Linked to beauty is the value of the thing. Only that which is valuable (not overall value, but, at least, value to the one who finds the thing beautiful) can be considered beautiful.  I know, it's a bit of a circle right now. I don't claim to know everything about the subject yet. I'm just trying to explain my reasonings for pursuing further research.  Life is beauty and the end of all things.

      1. art is not necessarily the work itself 2. art is not necessarily the artist him/herself 3. art is not necessarily communication 4. art is not necessarily a symbol 5. art has to do with experience/being 6. art has to do with conscious human intention 7. art is beautiful (in the broad sense that creation is beautiful) 8. nature is beautiful but not necessarily art (maybe god's art, but not human art) 9. art is nothing tangible/physical, it has to do with something mental (it "hangs in the air" between artist/observer and the work but is neither the artist/observer nor the work)  Sorry, I'm not making an argument here, just some thoughts I think are worth thinking about ;) I'm an artist myself, so I'm just laying out some of my feelings from my "artistic perspective."  I think "art" is simply the sort of Heideggerian being a human mind participates in when allowing a creative existence into one's thoughts. Not that there is a message or communication coming from the artist to the observer through the painting (for example); not even that the painting "stands" for something (is the symbol of...); but simply that there is this thing in the world that was created by human hands which *causes* certain experiential responses from others who observe it (this can even happen in the process of creating the thing, as is the case of the artist who observes his own painting as it is being painted--it's own unique kind of experience).   It's like, when I make a painting, I'm not intending to say something to anyone (necessarily), just that I'm pulling out of the chaos of the existing world a pattern of organization which brings with it certain possible ways of Being. Each observer of the painting brings with her a set of experiences and knowledge which naturally make her experience different from everyone else's. But the fact that the painting is the way it is *guides* the observer into experiencing life (being) in a certain manner.   Whatever it is that does the "guiding" is what I think is "art."

      I'd like to talk a little bit about "Lost in Translation." I really liked it when I first saw it, and now recently--watching it a few more times on DVD--I've discovered that I more than like it: I place it as one of my favorite movies of all time. But, I don't think it is because of the screen-play per se because of the multitude of possible experiences that the viewer is able to grasp from its Being.  I can watch and interpret different underlying meanings from what was presented to me on the screen. The first and probably most obvious interpretation is that of the man who contemplates an affair, far away from home, lonely and detached from his society. I could also look at Bob as not even interested in Charlotte as more than a good friend. But, then I could also look at it a different way still (the way I like to understand it). Perhaps he is simply a real human, Being through life, understanding the possible choices and simply going with the flow: he knows he *is* lonely and he's willing to go out partying because what else is he going to do by himself in a foreign land?  I think it's safe to say that Bob realizes his feelings are changing when he decides to stay for the "Carson" show (he realizes that he's interested in this girl as more than just a friend--this isn't to say that "more than a friend" should necessarily be romantic, but his relationship with her has grown past the point of simply feeling happy: he wants to *be* together). He kept their relationship Platonic. Did he realize his true(romantic) feelings for his wife and family and that that is more important than the lusts of the moment? He says in the middle how "the older you get, and the more you understand yourself, the less you let things bother you." So, is he simply understanding that he is a lonely male, next to an attractive and interest(ed)(ing) female and that his feelings of attraction are normal; that he doesn't need to get further romantically involved with this girl because he already has a romantic life, and that there are other/different kinds of possible relationships between two human beings?  Charlotte, obviously feeling alone and separated from her husband while he is away on photo-shoots, seems to be attracted to Bob for his strange, self-calm being. He's just living life, stopping to smell the roses, and is understanding of the overwhelming solipsistic struggle of conscious existence. He was there when she needed him, you know?  This film exemplifies an encounter of two people who live (be) with Each other, for real (as in not fake: they let all their guards down and were true/real/honest with each other). They shared moments of artistic experience like the honesty that comes from the artist because he puts his true feelings into the expression of his painting, communicating to the viewer his real human essence. For lack of a better way of putting it, their minds came together in a shared love of Being. I love this idea because it seems that's just how simple and wonderful actual life is. I just need to love my Being. If I want to be happier, then I should love being happy. If I think my morning commute is dull and boring, then I should make it more exciting by skipping along the sidewalk, smiling, and greeting strangers on the street. Why not? If I want to love another, to end my loneliness, to Be together, I can. These are the sorts of feelings that the examples in the movie bring to my attention.  I like the movie mostly because, although there is a clear message/theme that speaks through, there is also enough left unsaid (a healthy subtext) which can be experienced in more imaginative subtleties. I enjoyed filling-in the thoughts of the characters as they gave silly looks and grimaces to the Japanese and to each other. There was room to let the movie grow into *my* life and *my* Being. That is, by filling-in the character's thoughts with my own voice and memories and experiences, I was able to feel more a part of the their emotional struggles. The movie, in this sense, shared with me the same way the two characters were sharing with each other. It was personal. It was real. It was beautiful.

      So I'm back at work now after having a 5 day vacation. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.   On the good side, I'm earning money, my day is more structured and purposeful (if making money can be a purpose). I get to see and talk to the nice people here and I feel useful to a degree.  On the bad side, my purpose is earning money and I'm not being creative at all. I'm bored and I'm uninterested in the things my computer screen says to me.  ...whatever.  Maybe I can finish my stupid CV today and finally get it out of the way so I can apply for some different jobs. I plan to go back to school in the fall (I've definitely made that decision). Maybe I'll even take a course this summer to tide me over. I discovered just recently that Philosophy is my passion. If money and food and shelter wasn't a concern, I believe that this is the way I would choose to spend my time, so why am I not doing it? So I will. So there!  Ok, what can I say that has some more depth to it (other than me just complaining about and describing my boring life)?  Ok, how 'bout some aesthetic theory? I've recently been reading Heidegger and in particular his essay on the origin of art. In it he tries to distinguish artwork from the other things in the world in order to better understand what makes this thing over here "art" and that thing of there "not art".  I haven't read the whole essay yet, but what I've understood so far is interesting enough to talk about:  Three different types of things:  1. Mere things (the things in the universe that are just there, like rocks and dirt, and clouds, and stars, and water, etc.)  2. Equipment/tools (things that have been formed by the human hand for use in the formation of other matter)  3. Art works (things that have been formed by the human hand, but without the intention of being used to form other matter)   I thought about this for a while, and I began to have difficulty thinking of other things that humans make that aren't merely tools for making other things. Artwork seems to be the only thing we make simply for it to exist on its own.  For example, we make hammers (a formation of matter) to be used to form other matter (like hammering nails in the construction of a house). The house is a tool for sheltering our bodies from the elements. Even food is simply a tool we create through agriculture to ensure our survival. Computers calculate numbers to be used for accounting, creating art, communications. Money is a tool for trading goods. Furniture is used to feel comfortable (instead of sitting on the hard ground). Eventually we come to artwork, and the art thing itself isn't really useful in the same sense that the hammer is useful. The actual stretched canvas of a painting is no good other than to act as a surface for the painting, and the painting is simply there, to look at and enjoy. It isn't able to form other matter (it is the formation!)  So what does this mean? I was thinking that maybe artwork, then, is like the end result that all these other tools that we use are aiming for. Is artwork the end result of all our efforts? Are we all just searching for beauty?  Now, you might say that art is *used* for the pleasure we get from it (looking at a nice painting, listening to good music, etc.) But some art isn't created purely for pleasure. Sometimes artists make depressing songs, or horrific paintings. The intent of these works is obviously not pleasure.   So then, is it something more general like "an experience" that we are getting from the art; that is the art's use? I think this is too broad because we get "an experience" from every thing in the world, not just art.   It seems like art is formed by its creator and left there in the world to be a symbol for the artist's dream. The painting isn't even the actual art, only the physical representation of the dream in the artist's head. The work, like a word, stands for ideas and communicates thoughts across the barriers of space and time.   So is it a tool for communication? Maybe. But I think it's more than mere communication, it is a window into the human soul. It not only communicates something about the artist, but about the human condition in general. It does this because artwork is the human expression of worth and meaning that the artist feels needs to be created and thought about by others. It is an externalization of his/her emotions. It is a spillage of his/her soul. Ok ok, I'm preaching... This is the way I'm thinking, that's all.  I'm just trying to understand artwork as something important, and I believe that it is important in the sense that it shows us a bit of who we are (the viewer of a painting influences the interpretation, but overlaps with the thoughts of the artist and allows a sharing of human consciousness). Is that important? If anything else, it demonstrates that we aren't alone in the universe. What the artist creates is a work of love and we can all share that feeling with each other through art.   Love is a reason worth living for. In that sense, I guess artwork is a thing (a formation of matter) that communicates love, and then by deduction, a purpose for existence. Not that its *the* purpose, but a part of it anyway.  ...just some things I've been thinking about lately.

      I need to write something before my mind floats away on me (my life is now unbearably light).  Ok, where to start? Well, I could complain about all my stress, how my job doesn't meet any of my expectations (money-wise or meaning-wise), that I'm extremely anxious to start school again and do something meaningful with my time, that I money is a huge constraint on my life, and that I'm getting fedup with most of it.  It all hit me yesterday while I was waiting for the bus to go home. I sat there, listening to my walkman in a kind of daze after a long day at work. I felt like I was dreaming, that it wasn't real. I tried hard to concentrate on the road in front of me, but it *really* felt fake and I felt less conscious about reality. It felt like my ego was fading away and I was observing myself doing things out in the world, but I wasn't really doing them (just my body was doing them). A very strange phenomenon to say the least.  So I decided I need to do more things that keep my mind sharp, but reality clear. My whole day at work is so monotonous and boring that I think I do most of my job on "autopilot" and so by the end of the day, I've spent 8 hours without actually thinking. I'm trying to read more online articles, write stuff in between phone calls, and generally just focus/think/meditate consciously instead of zoning out. It's really hard to do actually. But how else can I keep it real, as people say?  My life really does feel like one big white haze now. It's all fuzzy and cloudy. I wonder where I'm going. I think about the stuff that matters to me like ideas and beauty, and even those things seem distant and irrelevant. If I don't feel alive (first of all) how does any of the other stuff matter? What does existence really mean if I feel like I'm dreaming? I feel lost at sea.  I'm trying to build a raft with the junk that floats by me, and I'm paddling towards the island I see in the distance (but I'm not there yet). Once I get there I imagine things will be better and I will be able to relax, but for now I'm still sea-sick and anxious about the next storm that could hit me out here in the middle of the ocean.  I guess I'm doing all I can do for now. I'll reach shore soon enough. I'm just keepin' it real.

      This isn't really going to be indepth or anything, just some random thoughts (that's what a meditation is anyway, right?)  So in the fall I'm going to apply for an independent study course (read undergrad thesis) and I need to decide what my topic and scope will be for this monster 75 page+ project that I will undertake.  Obviously, I'd like to involve my experience with aesthetics, but maybe I could somehow relate it to either of "the human condition," "human consciousness/mind," or "spiritual life." These are so broad that I would need to whittle them down to be more specific, and as being specific, I'm currently unsure what to choose to focus on.  One of my interests has been with language and it's inaccurate references to mental semantic representation. So like, I have an idea in my head and I want to communicate it to someone else. The best way to do this (apparently) would be to translate my thought into a language and send it out through the airwaves to the ears of my prospective listener of my idea. So I might say the word "god" and the listener hears "gawd" and this sound gets translated in the listener's head into an association of meanings and ideas that s/he has to represent the meaning of the sound that I made with my mouth. But can I really trust that the idea that the listener then has in his/her head is really the same idea that I had in mine before I made the sound?  What if my idea is of "the good" or "the moral" or "the infinite" or "that which is an idea greater than any idea my finite mind can conceive"? This could contrast other possible interpretations of the sound I made ("gawd") such as "the primary cause" or "the heavenly father" or "the universal consciousness" etc. I mean, I could elaborate on which specific meaning I am thinking about by expanding that one word into a set of many more descriptive words, but my point is that any words that we use to represent ideas always seem to have this problem of interpretation and so language is always hazy and inaccurate in its description of our thoughts.   I could write an entire series of books about what my meaning of the word "god" is and still not be able to truly communicate the idea in my head. I could get closer to its meaning, but the language becomes very tedious and cumbersome. I have an idea in my head, it only takes me a few moments to bring it forth to consciousness and consider it, but it would take me years to spell it out in language in order to communicate my idea to someone else. There's got to be a better way to clearly express myself. Multiple books written over multiple years just seems to make the idea less clear in the end anyway.  So what else is there? Painting pictures? Writing fiction? Setting up life-experiential examples of sensation? I don't know.   So maybe that can be my focus: not to answer the whole question, but to examine how communication through art is differently expressive (limitations and richness) than language is. The communication of fundamental human emotions is a certain method of expression that seems to be very difficult to do in words (e.g., the quick brush stroke on a canvas says a lot about the painter's Being in a quick glance compared to a novel or a poem which would take many hours to digest).   I think speed of communication is very important. We live finite lives, we get bored and distracted, we have better things to do than wait for the understanding of one idea (there are so many other ideas to be thinking about). The quicker an idea can be communicated, the more effective it is (whatever that means). The point is, a painting is an alternate communication medium that may be able to provide a speedier delivery in some instances which should be taken more seriously in public discourse (i.e., just because something is written out with a bunch of words doesn't mean that it is the best representation of that idea). And maybe combinations of mediums should be looked at so that instead of having a multitude of written prose or an abstract, multi-interpretable painting, the combination of the two would make the communication more concise, precise, and understandable. Multimedia in pure idea expression should be developed further in the traditional disciplines.   Is there such a multi-media communication that is taken seriously instead of merely "some crazy art?" I want to seriously tell somebody something, could multimedia be the best medium (e.g., essay + paintings + whatever = clearer representation of my idea).  I'll focus specifically on paintings + writing because I have the most experience with these mediums, but I believe this would be sufficient to demonstrate that multiple mediums (writing + painting) can be more accurate than single media in isolation. So, maybe that's my project. I'd be speaking on a more abstract level of logic than any specific expression of ideas. But maybe this sort of research could give me the framework to develop these other ideas of mine.  I'll have to think about it some more :)

      Not really thoughts; not really concepts; almost meaningful, but always lurking on the outskirts of discernment. What are you supposed to do with that?  If you feel "good" what does that mean? Is feeling good a raison d'etre? Does feeling "not-good" take away from life? What is it that causes the goodness of life? I don't know...  Some people say it's God. That He is intervening and making the world good; that miracles happen and are a result of his divine power. Other people say it's the dream of human existence to be in a state of goodness (not necessarily God, but simply the concept that there is a category of things that are good relative to not-good). Some say it's meaningless regardless, others say life is the fulfillment of hopes and dreams (which may not produce a good feeling all the time, but an overall sense of being). Me, I tend to agree with all the interpretations taken together as referencing the same idea from different points of view. I'm a believer in God that is Good.  Should we always be seeking good? Is it something moral? Why good and not not-good? Who cares? I guess it just comes down to how you want to Be. Do you want to exist in a good world or a not-good world? I make my choices in this sense, wanting a "good" world because of my feelings that this is a good thing ;)  Ok, I've just gone in a big circle. It's all good I suppose.

      Why am I so obsessive?&nbsp; When my mind gets focused on an idea, I can't consider any other idea until I've used the one-at-hand up.&nbsp; For example, I recently had the brilliant to sell my insane multimedia studio (i.e., my computer) and use the money to buy myself a Mac Powerbook laptop which would do almost the same thing but be extremely portable such that I would always have full access to my data and be able to manipulate it anywhere in the world that I go.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; But then I started looking at the pictures and the specs of the powerbooks on the  urlLink Apple Store  and then configuring and reconfiguring my "orders" to fit my technical and budgetary needs.&nbsp; Then I went through all the listings on  urlLink eBay  to try to find a cheaper deal.&nbsp; Then I looked through  urlLink Apple's  financing options so that I wouldn't be required to pay the full amount up front but could pay it off over the course of two years.&nbsp; Then I looked at the software, got scared of the prices, looked at what was on  urlLink eBay , got scared of the prices, then searched for  urlLink bittorrents  for  urlLink free stuff .&nbsp; I calculated endless variations of how I could off my computer equipment to recover enough cash to cover my powerbook dream.&nbsp; Then I'd look at some more of the pictures on the website and imagine what I'd do with it.&nbsp; I twirled the QuickTime VRs and looked at it from every different angle.&nbsp; Then I tried all the other third-party resellers and discovered they sold the machines for pretty much the same price.&nbsp; Then I got discouraged and looked at my bank account to see how much I could really put into a new laptop.&nbsp; Now I'm all anxious and jittery and can't stop thinking about powerbooks!   What's my problem?&nbsp; Why can't I just have an idea, think about it, and  move on !?&nbsp; I'm annoying everyone around me always talking about the same thing.&nbsp; I'm annoying myself note getting any "real" work done.&nbsp; I'm wasting time and energy on futilities which can't sort themselves out until action is taken (e.g., selling my main computer system).&nbsp; I know rationally I should just calm down, take a deep breath, and put the idea on hold temporarily.&nbsp; But I keep feeling anxious and it bugs the hell out of me!&nbsp; That's why I'm writing this now:&nbsp; in the hopes of alleviating some sense of the anxiety by expressing my frustrations with it.&nbsp;   But that only deals with my current obsession.&nbsp; Where does Obsession stem from in general?&nbsp; Why am I the kind of person who gets obsessed like this?&nbsp; Or is it something not so uncommon as I believe?&nbsp; Are other people like this too in their own ways?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; All I know is that I don't like this current feeling and I just want to get on with my life instead of having it fell like  it's  on hold while I obsess of material inconsequentialisms.

      Encountering an existence which makes no sense (i.e., that is absurd) what is there to do with it?  What's the point of doing anything at all?  Well, death (as seen as oblivion:  that is, nothing) is obviously not life.  In a sense, no thing is not life (life is the experience of such phenomena).  There is no good and evil in nothing (in death) since there is no existent self to judge or experience that good or evil.  Whatever it is that is good has got to be found in life and in what we  do .    Ok, so you're probably going to make the connection from my title that art, then, must be the ultimate good or something like that.  That's not what I'm going after.  Maybe art could be negative as well, but the point is that art is  living .  Creating it, viewing it, interacting with it, thinking about it, whatever  it  is, is involving our selves qua selves.  Our individual personas come to the forefront of being when they are engaged in some form of art (if they aren't, then the self isn't perceiving  art  but something else, like a wall, or a paper weight, or whatever).  Art, then,  is  life.  Not  all  life, but life nonetheless.

      So  urlLink Alisha  just told me that she's being audited by the government of Canada today.  She has to gather  in a month  all her documentation for the past two years regarding her expenses.  Who the hell  keeps  all their documentation for the past two years (let alone the past two months)?  I mean, sure I might have some gas and hydro bills lying around, but I share that stuff with my roomates.  What do  they  do if they need those documents and I'm the only one who has copies?  I don't handle the phone bill, my roomate Karen does.  I don't have any records of how much money I've spent on the phone bill for the past two years.  Am I supposed to photocopy each and every bill and file it and save it in a box with a pile of other useless paper?  Makes you wonder why the rainforests are dying.  In Alisha's case, she lived at a house that has since sold, and the owner is nowhere to be found so he can't be contacted to verify Alisha's testimony.  What the fuck are you supposed to do in  that  situation?  I understand that the government is hurting for money (aren't we all?) and it can't afford for people to be fraudulently reporting their taxes and whatever.  But Alisha and all the rest of my friends are just students out of school with less than no money.  Even if we were stealing from the government we'd still have nothing.  What do they expect us to do?  Alisha's going to have to pay additional taxes because she can't prove where she lived for the last year (cuz the guy's gone).  She didn't live  nowhere .  Her rent wasn't  zero .  And it probably wasn't even that much either.  It just seems like they're trying to draw blood from a stone (and not even a stone... I mean it's just nothing... us students  have NOTHING !)  So Alisha is in the middle of trying to find a job to pay her piling bills, the bank is breathing down her neck because she can't pay her loans, and now the government decided to audit her.  What the hell man?  If no one will hire you and you got no money, what are you supposed to do?  Let me analyze this situation from a more abstract perspective.  What the fuck does the government actually  do  for us in the first place anyway?   1.  Protection from invading barbarians  Isn't this over and done with already?  Who the hell really cares enough to mount an army, cross the ocean, and invade another country?  What would the point be?  Ok, there's terrorists, and third world nations who want our food or whatever, but man.  Those are just the people in the world that share the Earth with us too.  If they want to move in, shouldn't they be allowed?   2. Law and Order  Arguments might be thrown around like over population and destruction of the environment and lack of food and violence.  But why do these things happen in the first place?  Do we really need laws to  tell  people what to do?  We're intelligent creatures.  We can think for ourselves.  Maybe the problem is just that people don't understand fully what the situation is.  Maybe it's  education  that is needed, not some far off "leader" yelling down from his palace telling us how we should be living our lives.   3. Health Care  I care for my friends, and I care that I live amongst a group of people who live lives similar to my own.  I think we got an ok thing going for the most part and I'd want to help keep it going, you know?  If I had a knowledge of medicine and stuff, I'd share that with y'all to help you when you got sick.  But I'm no doctor.  Instead, I'm an  urlLink artist , and I share beauty with everyone to care for aesthetic minds (that's just what I happen to be good at).  If the government wasn't pulling the strings, I think we'd still help each other out.  We might not get  paid  but maybe we'd feel good at the end of a day of helping out.  Things wouldn't become complete chaos either.  We're smart and would organize into structures (e.g., hospitals) that would help us on our journeys through Being.   4. Roads and Transportation, Etc.  If you want to go somewhere, you'll find a way of getting there.  If it means building a road, I'm sure you could find a group of other people who need a road too and you could band together to make that road.    . . .  Ok, maybe I'm taking things too far to an anarchist extreme.  The point is, I think our society is too stuck up in its hierarchical structures which are deemed  a priori  "right."  Guess what government!  There  is  no right and wrong!  That's just something we made up so only the "good," white, Christians could go to heaven.    We've each of us got enough problems on our plates to handle.  We don't need abstract hierarchies imposing additional strain on our lives.  Life on its own is fucked up as it is (what the hell  is  humanity and what is it doing here?)  Can't we just be left alone to figure shit out?  I didn't  choose  to be born into this society.  I didn't choose the laws that govern me (as much as they'd like to make me believe that I live in a democracy, what say have I really had in its operation and development?).  I don't agree with the goals of the larger group, or even that "larger group" is a meaningful category.  I've never met someone from British Columbia; how could I be expected to understand the needs and desires of B.C. Dasein?  I can't.  That's my point.  Neither can Ottawa understand mine.   So, Canada.  Why don't you piss off and let just let us Be?

       Headaches:  A storm front moved in, the air suddenly got humid, the air pressure rose, and now I've a crazy migraine headache! I almost felt like I was going to throw up yesterday, and now today I still feel a pressure behind my eyes and my consciousness is cloudy. Weather sucks in my opinion.    Temperature:  The summer's too fucking hot and the winter's too fucking cold. You can't win with weather! Summers here in Toronto are so crazy humid that I can barely breathe sometimes (I'm overexagerating, but it's bad nonetheless). The heat can't dissipate from my body, I sweat like a fountain, I overheat, approach heat exhaustion, get a fever, can't think straight, my clothes are wet, I'm uncomfortable and sticky, there's bugs, my summer school classes are insane because they're squished into half the time of normal, and there's nothing I can do to adjust my internal temperature (e.g., in winter you can always add or remove clothing, but in the summer, once you're stripped down to boxers and taken your shirt off and you're  still  hot, there's nothing more you can do but suffer!   Winter, on the other hand, here in Canada, can get pretty brutal too. Negative forty degrees temperature can leave you wishing you never stepped outside. Frost-bite, numb feet, shortness of breathe (for inability to inhale large amounts of bitter cold air), machinery not functioning properly (e.g., starting a car engine from freezing, walkman breaking because the circuits' electrons won't flow properly, etc.), drafts in windows leak heat and raise the gas bill to unfathomable prices, and salt on the streets destroys any clothing withing a foot of the ground. Add to that stepping through slush, getting stuck in snow drifts, changing from boots to shows all the time, and shivering a lot, and you can see that winter is pretty nasty.   Low temperature, just like high temperature, really really sucks ass. I think spring and fall are the best seasons for their mild climate and manageable temperatures. I can go outside with the clothes I  normally  wear and not even  think  about the temperature (it merely being equilibrious with the temperature of my body).    Wet:  Get caught in the rain or the snow and you'll get wet and attract disease. You will get uncomfortable, your clothes will stick to your body, and you'll be very cold. Your shoes will get soaked with slush, a bus may splash a puddle all over your newly bought clothes, the roof of your house may leak. Whatever you can say about weather, its wetness really blows.    Depression:  I can't help it. On dark, rainy (or limitedly lighted winter) days I get depressed. My motivation goes down the tubes, I don't want to get out of bed, and I get easily frustrated with minor irritations. The next day when the sun comes out and shines through the windows my mood can take a one-eighty and I can feel completely different. I don't like that my personhood is so dependent on something as uncontrollable as the weather.   I could go on and on about what I dislike about the weather. Certainly there are benefits to weather, but when it comes down to it, on a personal, phenomenal/existential level, weather just plain sucks.

      So I was trying to edit my profile text with a new "Random Question" answer, but the computer told me that I can only use 150 characters at maximum.  So I decided to cut it short and post the rest of what I wrote here:  Why is everyone so keen on winning?  What are we winning?  Shit just happens man... you gotta go with tha' floooow.  If the turtle feels like hanging back and chillin' then that's cool.  I'm not going to win (alternatively I've already won) because there simply is no race in the first place.  Experience, love, beauty, existence, consciousness, phenomena:  these are cool things, non of which involve any kind of competition.

      So I started two new blogs last night.  One's for  urlLink my code  diaries and the other is for a series I'm going to start about things that happen, or that I think about, on the streetcar called  urlLink The Streetcar Diaries .    In other news, I think the colour Pink is cool.  My windows at work (that is, on my  computer , for all you technophobes :P) are all pink and baby blue.  It's very relaxing, soothing, and non-obtrusive.  I've tried all the other colours, but pink is the only one that doesn't "bother" me in some way.  Why is pink a "girl's" colour anyway?  Who decided that?  It's just a colour.  I don't think it has any a priori sexual connotations to it.  It's all just socially constructed.  Society is fucked.

      Man, I'm dragging my feet and fighting to keep my eyes open in order to do my job (i.e., starring at my computer screen).  I need to get more sleep.  I think staying at Alisha's all the time is finally taking its tole on me physically.  It's not her fault, just that it's hard to sleep in someone else's bed (and her air conditioner is  so  loud!)  It just accumulates, that's all.  If I alternated between Alisha's and my bed more often I bet I'd get better (moderated) rest.  I don't even feel like going to class tonight.  I just want to go home and sleep.  Uggh.  But I'll drag my ass over there and listen to the prof drone on about givenness and immanence and transcendence anyway just in order to push beyond my own facticity and free make my historicity out of my conscious (willful) decisions.... but I'm  so  tired!  I want to work more on my website and get it done so I can go back to concentrating on my writing and content creation instead of doing all this programming stuff (fun as it may be).  I value my works of art more than my works of pragmatism.  I'll do a little of both tonight when I get back I suppose.  Plus I need to read two more chapters of Husserl to catch up for my class (my essay is due next week!)  Man, I got a lot on my plate.  Did I mention I'm constructing a new web software that for writers to organize text on a centralized, online database?  Yeah, well there's that too.  Why do I do this to myself?  I guess it's what I'm good at, and I value creation more than anything else.  That's the artist in me I suppose. :)

      How can this be?  How can I be bored out of my freaking mind and at the same time excited and on the edge of my seat?    I'm redesigning my website and creating a new interactive literature creation community (wiki.whitehaze.com) and I've be programming databases and reading phenomenology and imagining all the cool things I want to do in the near future (and how I want to get doing them right now!)  On top of this, I'm writing a few stories here, a couple poems there, and an essay or two for class.  So this is why I'm excited.  But at this very moment, I'm a work.  I'm staring at a computer screen with lots of names and numbers on it.  I'm sorting by date, by client, by status and providing updates to lenders and reminders to appraisers.  I'm bored out of my mind!  I can't wait until 5:00pm roles around and I can get back to actively engaging in the exciting part of my life:  things that actually matter (to me and the rest of my friends).  Work blows.

      I was just browsing through  urlLink wordcount  for my name in the list of ranked, most commonly used words that  urlLink Alisha  mentioned in  urlLink her blog .  Apparently my name ("rob") is ranked #5378 most commonly used word.  Obviously this is probably from the word "rob," as in "to rob" like a bank robber or something, but that's my name nonetheless.    What's interesting is to think about it's personal-relative context with the neighbouring most-commonly-used-words.  My name is stuck between "server" and "conflicts".  This is interesting to me because I'm a computer geek, and taking "server" to mean computer-server, a "server conflict" would be some sort of error with the brain of a computer network.  I work in tech support at my job, so I deal with "server conflicts" everyday.  I thought it was quite appropriate that my name should be located between these two words.  Taken another, more interesting, way, "server clonflicts" could be extrapolated to mean "conflict in the serving of information" in general.  I associate this with the serving of information in my mind to my consciousness.  Being a philosophy major and an avid Thinker, I often experience conflicts of thought in the sense of existential angst and ontological uncanniness.  What am I doing here?  Who am I?  What does it all mean?  ...that sort of stuff.  So, in this sense "server conflicts" seem appropriate for describing my situation.  On a side note, "Alisha" is not listed in the words, but spelled a different way "Alicia" is listed as #27347 between "keats" and "rundown."  Maybe Alisha's poetical understandings can give a good rundown on Keats, eh?  Just something to think about :)    I love words.   urlLink This  is a cool site.

      I've come up with yet  another  project for myself.  This time in the form of a website (big surprise).  I'm going to take all my "group" oriented ideas (like conorgan, wiki, forums, public galleries, etc.) and make a new domain called "artgoodness."  It'll be a tribute to struggling artists out there who don't have a place to voice their opinions and interact with other artists (let alone showcase their work).  It's still in the early stages of idea development, but this is where some of my efforts will be headed.  Interesting things that will be on the site:  1. Forums (all artistic things to be discussed from illustration to photography to getting a job) 2. Galleries (I plan to have personal galleries for each user, public "showcase" galleries of all the best work, and "open" galleries where absolutely any anonymous jigalo can post a picture) 3. Wiki (I want to make a section for "wikiness" where users can edit the content they view directly; this will also involve the  urlLink conOrgan  project that I'm working on to help writers organize their content and help each other collaborate on their large bodies of text) 4. Tutorials (I plan to write and gather a collection of useful instructions on how to do artistic things; not necessarily technology oriented, but also things like how to hold a brush/pencil and basic design principles, etc.) 5. Collaborations (I want to use internet technology to leverage artists' desire to collaborate with one another; we're interested in beauty, right?  non of us is going to become famous any time soon; let's play around and experiment and discover new things and new beauties; this is what the collaboration section is all about) 6. Search-ability (everything and everyone will be highly searchable so that content can be found quickly and easily)  These are just some of the basic ideas I'm working towards.  More will come as I implement them.  This will be a site for artists that aren't well known yet, but have talent and a love of beauty.  We'll help each other out in an effort to launch ourselves into sustainability.  That's "goodness" to me ;)

       index 0.7.x::   I'm going to start finally updating the entire database and populating it with all the content information (this is only partially completed at this time, so  urlLink index  doesn't fill out very much.    Eventually I also want to make the entire page a complete dynamic representation of my content database.  Right now it loads the category headings statically (encoded in the html), but I'd like it to eventually be a standalone  urlLink php  script that simply generates itself based on  whatever  is in the database (this way it would be fully self-updating).  At the moment it  sortof  does this in that for each category it loads all content in that category and generates a date-oriented list.  But I want to extend this idea to incorporate generation of the categories as well.  My only problem in implementing this at the moment is deciding how the categories should be divided amongst the three columns of lists on the page.  How do I evenly distribute them because some have hundreds of entries, and some only have ten.  The page would be lopsided if I it generated categories that are very large all in the same column and then had only small categories in another.  So this is what I'm trying to figure out right now for the 0.7.x release.   output 0.3.x::   Right now  urlLink output  is simply a static page with a list of all the manual emails I've sent out of my writing over the past year.  I would like to change this so that it dynamically generates a linked list of pages that are sortable of all the content in the database.  The default setting will be a "newest to oldest" list with about 10-20 entries per page.  Each entry will list the title, date, author, and short description (with a link to the full content of course) something like what  urlLink slashdot  does for their forum descriptions.  I'll make little icons for the different kinds of content too (e.g., painting or essay or website, etc.).  I can't wait   blog 0.3.x::   I love blogging (as you can see) and I plan to put all my daily "brain farts" and "thinklets" in  urlLink this  database of text.  In the 0.3.x series I will be implementing a sort of  urlLink slashdotty  kind of "brief" list of all the recent entries I've added and have easy links to each blog with other kinds of general info on the main page.  I don't know how to do this yet (I think I'm going to have to do something with  urlLink atom  but I don't understand it yet.  This series will be to learn how.   wiki 0.1.x::    urlLink This  is the big one.  It's going to be a centralized writer's community where writers can save their work, organize it, work on rough writing like character sketches, plans, themes, synopses, etc. and critique oneanother to work towards perfections (whatever  that  is ;)  It will be powered by  urlLink conorgan  which is an open source content organization system that I am developing at  urlLink sourceforge .  The 0.1.x series is simply a planning stage and experiment.  I will mainly be playing around with the database and organizing it and doing lots of JOINS and table generation and relational normalizations (if that's the kind of thing you're interested in).  Until I figure out the best way of organizing the data, linking users to their work in their own work areas, and how to relate all the information together to be efficient and understandable, this 0.1.x series will be highly volatile.  So watch your step ;)   code 0.1.x::    urlLink This  website is still in development.  Over the course of the 0.1.x series I will add simple text links to ZIP files of all the code that I'm working on.  I will post a link to the most current (experimental) code as well as a link to any past (stable) releases that have been designed and geared towards alternate uses (beyond the specific uses that I am using them for).  So eventually I'd like to have the above sorts of database listing pages and my  urlLink wiki  code posted here so all y'all can use it for your own purposes too.  Sidenote:  I know how difficult it is to understand other people's code (especially for the intermediate developer:  like me ;) And I know how frustrating it is to either get code that's too specific to make use of in a different application or too general to even understand how the hell it can be implemented at all.  I want to try to provide adequate comments for all my variables and functions (mainly just so  I  can understand what I'm doing) and also to provide significant documentation where necessary.  I think documentation is  just  as important as the code itself because if nobody can understand what the code does then how is it at all useful?

      Here are some possible reasons/motivations for writing: 1.  organize your thoughts 2.  show off your wit 3.  make something beautiful 4.  communicate with a large audience 5.  provide a resource/tool that other people can use 6.  make money off publishing your work 7.  find the Truth (e.g., science, philosophy, etc.) 8.  gather the resources of human ideas and combine them and add to them in such a way that something substantially new can be added in order to expand those ideas to new frontiers  Ok, now the webtool that I'm thinking of making called  urlLink conorgan  will be very public and interactive with its users.  I'm thinking of the  urlLink wiki  movement in which anyone visiting the website can access the content of the site and alter it.  So, if you've got a piece of writing published on this website, anyone can edit it besides just you.  They can fix spelling mistakes, correct errors of facts, add analogies, add thoughts and ideas, take a story in a new direction that wasn't thought of before, or completely change the story from start to finish.  It's all about the collaboration.  Two heads are better than one.  And that's the defining characteristic of humanity that separates us from all the other animals:  intelligent, organized teamwork.  You might be asking yourself at this point if your work is really your work anymore.  What if someone comes and vandalizes the entire thing and wipes out all your efforts?  What if you loose your sense of connection with your art to the point where it's not you anymore and you feel snuffed?  I'll try to explain how these concerns can be managed, if not alleviated.  So, what happens if someone messes with your baby?  Well, that's where versioning comes in.  If the newer (messed up) version isn't to your liking, you can just revert to an older version and be back where you started with a few clicks of the mouse (no big deal).    The thing is, what makes you think that your work is going to attract so much attention to itself that people are going to want to mess it up in the first place?  Think about this for a moment.  What motivates a person to go out of their way to perform malicious acts of vandalism of works that are hardly known to exist?  Isn't the thrill of vandalism connected to the idea that the vandalized will affect other minds?  My little story hidden away in the depths of my website are hardly going to be important enough for anyone to even *want* to mess with because there's no benefit to anyone if it's messed up (including the vandal).  But in the rare case where someone *does* wreck it, it's a simple matter to revert through the version history to a more stable state of affairs.  The point is, just as easy as it is to change and wreck and alter, it's just as easy to revert and fix and improve.  If someone does something you don't like, then change it to something *you* like. Remember that people are lazy (much lazier than you are writing this piece of text).  For someone to be motivated enough to get off their ass and change something in the world they would require a substantial reward (like seeing a poor artist cry because their writing was destroyed).  But if they know in advance how easy it is to simply delete the vandalized edit, and that it's not a big deal anyway because the audience for the vandalism is miniscule, then laziness will probably win out and nothing will happen.  Don't worry about it.   Keep in mind too that because you're the author and the person most highly interested in the text's development, you (and only you?) will be paying the most attention to it and changing things around to what  you  think is best.  Other people know this because they can see your name on it as the creator and will understand if you change something that has been altered by someone else.  It's like an unwritten rule that the creator/author of the work has a heavy say in how the text develops and what directions it takes.  I mean, ultimately it is complete anarchy, but people have respect and won't cry home to mommy because the paragraph they added on to your novel got deleted by you or that you changed the paragraph's meaning.  They should just be happy that they're participating in the novel (having their name added as a contributor) and working towards a greater overall beauty in the world (and so should you!)  If you're concerned about how you're going to publish your work once it's done (now having been contributed to by many other people) maybe you should think about what your goals are.  Are you a writer or an entrepreneur?  If all you're interested in is making money, there are far better ways of doing so than writing!    I don't think that any person is an island or that one mind can come close to meeting the potential of many minds.  We need to get over our capitalistic, exclusionary attitudes that our modern "American" society has imposed on us and think about the more fundamental benefits:  beauty, humanity, relationships, experience, ideas, entertainment, and happiness.  Money isn't necessarily part of the equation, so why are we getting so attached to this artificial utility?  If you really do want to publish your work eventually (and let's be honest, who  doesn't  want to publish their writing and get that sort of ego boost knowing that your words are "out there"?) I don't think this is restricted as such.  You might have to have included in your book a "page of contributors" listing the people who made contributions to your work and helped you out.  You may have to co-author the work if another contributor made just as many substantial contributions as you did.  It's all about being fair I think.  If someone helped you out, then acknowledge that.  If they helped you out so much that you think they deserve a cut of the pie, then why not?  Just be open and honest with everyone.  Tell all the contributors that you're thinking of publishing the work, what sorts of financial returns you expect, and how you intend to distribute those rents to the people who worked on it (if at all).    If you know for a fact that you did 99% of the creative work and that other people merely contributed spelling corrections and the like, I think it's reasonable to merely have their names included in the contributor's page.  If someone else added 10 chapters to your book independently, then maybe you should consider rewarding that person with a substantial portion of the returns you are going to get from its publication.  At this point you may be asking what is stopping  anybody  from publishing the work.  Well, not much.  All work on the website will use a license that you can choose to bind a social agreement between contributors (e.g., a common clause of most licenses is that the creator's name must  always  be attached to the work).  So if someone else (maybe even someone who didn't even contribute anything to the work proper) decides to publish the work, they can do so but only in accordance with the associated license agreement (e.g., they have to give you the credit you deserve).  You may choose a license which restricts any kind of commercial distribution of the work by anybody besides the work's creator, for instance (this would also let people know before they themselves contribute substantially to the work that they have no guarantee to commerciality... but I'm sure if they asked you to be compensated for a really cool addition you wouldn't ignore them, right?)  There are other, more liberal licenses which allow absolutely anyone to sell the work.  You could also outrightly contribute your work to the public domain to do with it as it wishes.  The thing to balance is distribution, participation, and freedom versus personal gains and secrecy.  I'm not disagreeing with getting paid for your hard efforts or saying that it's a bad thing, but I just think it's important to keep things in perspective:  what are your true motivations?  Why do you write what you write?  Remember that you're part of a society and not some solipsistic bubble.  The most profound and life-changing (history making) ideas are the ones that are freely available.  Socrates didn't hide all his thoughts to himself and only allow access to a privileged elite who could afford to buy his books.  No, he walked in the streets and told people right to their faces what he thought of them.  He had some pretty cool ideas, but he wasn't afraid of someone "stealing" them because that simply wasn't what he wanted out of them:  he was more concerned with proliferating his ideas and understanding human life than "copyrighting" and making a profit.    Think about it from the "believers" perspective.  Are you going to want to learn about and integrate into your life an idea that costs you $10 and that you have to go all the way downtown to the book store to get (that is, if it's such a popular idea that you even know about it in the first place) or are you going to be more interested in a great idea that you can freely read about on the internet, in your own livingroom?  I think the internet idea would more easily "get into" people's minds.  And once there (if your idea makes sense and is interesting) it will be passed on to the others of that original reader's social network and thus the idea spreads and grows in understanding.  That's how things change.  The work is judged for its value as a resource of information and knowledge, not as a physical economic rent.  Do you want to change the world, or just make enough money to live?    Put a different way, do you want to be a poor, popular, and influential writer or a poor, unknown, published writer?

      So I'm starting this new open source project over on sourceforge ( urlLink conorgan.sourceforge.net ) to create a tool for writers (a wiki website to be exact) to enable them (including me) to write more effectively, efficiently, easily, and readily.  The website will be a centralized database for storage of writing that can be worked on from any internet access point.  It will be stored using strict xhtml for compatibility with the future.  I will organize works and ideas (e.g,. for a novel you might want to save character sketches, plot summaries, themes, titles, brain farts, etc. along side the actual chapters and alternate versions).  That's the other thing too.  As you create work and edit it and change it, each change "history" will be saved so that no information is ever lost by hiting that backspace button and erasing your famous line from History.    But the interesting aspect of the whole thing is its wikiness.  Wikis are interactive, dynamic websites that involve not only the "designer" but the reader as well.  If a reader spots a spelling or grammar mistake in your work, she can go right into it and fix it herself instead of ignoring it (a benefit to the work as a whole, and saves the writer time to concentrate on more important things like concepts and plots).  But it also enables the readers to make suggestions about what ideas and concepts she thinks are good ones.  This may sound controversial to all you "artists" out there, but I mean the reader is the one reading it, and if she has a good idea why shouldn't it be incorporated?  I'm not saying that all ideas are good ones, but that they should at least be considered and not dismissed because they didn't come "from the artist's soul" or something like that.  I'm interested here in what is beautiful, not necessarily what is a "pure" expression of my individual self.  I'll talk about this more later, but right now I'm super duper tired cuz it's like past one in the morning here.  I gotta get up early for work.  I'll write more when I get back to my boring office job ;)

      Ok, just a short note.  I'm revamping my entire site to be more community oriented.  I'm making whitehaze public.  My previous idea about Art Goodness will be incorporated into my main site.  I think this is what I've been striving for the whole time I've been working on  urlLink whitehaze  but was just to scared to admit it.  Anyone can be involved in the new paradigm, but only "art goodness" will be included.  What that means, is something I need to figure out.  But it's going to be cool! :D
