       Well, what makes a better first political post than the issues in the Iraqi War?  It's the main news in the world, even outside of the United States.  The question is, which side is right?  How about neither?  We're locked in a war on terror.  A global conflict between the United States and those individuals and groups around the world that wish to hurt either America or its allies.  Of course, Bush has a little convoluted view on exactly what is harmful to America and what isn't.  Afghanistan was the first logical choice, as it was the last known 'resort' for the world's leader in terrorism at the time of the September 11th attacks, Osama bin Laden.  But, that witchhunt wasn't just a witchhunt, it was a full-on invasion of a sovereign nation.  The basis for these attacks: to limit terrorism and its supporters around the globe.  But, invasion of a sovereign nation without due proof that it is involved in any offensive strikes against the nation is imperialistic plain and simple.  Implementing freedom on that populace from a oppressive regime is all well and good, but don't do so under the guise of terror.  Do it under the guise of spreading freedom and democracy to the world.  There is a large difference between the two.  Now, fast forward a bit to another very similar instance: the unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation, namely to oust the oppressive dictator Saddam Hussein, accused by the CIA and Russian president Vladimir Putin as having "weapons of mass destruction", and harbouring terrorists.  Once again, this is all well and good when you have the proof.  Unfortunately, the United States, and their cowboy president George Bush, did not.  What we do know is that Iraq  had  "weapons of mass destruction", having acquired them through various means through his two-decade-plus rule.  The United Nations aknowledged the fact that they had them, and after a resolution, ordered Saddam Hussein to dismantle and destroy them in a timely and safe fashion while providing proof of this.  Hussein of course claimed he followed the orders of the United Nations resolution, but why did he fail to offer proof?  Hans Blix and crew soon rolled into Iraq with their little convoy of Landrovers on a tour of the country in a search for these weapons.  Periods of time past, and still no weapons were found.  The weapons that had definitely been there had suddenly disappeared, and with no trace as to where they went.  George Bush wasn't as patient as the United Nations.  In rushed the United States military, claiming once again that they were routing Iraq under the guise of "terrorism".  Once again, a sovereign nation was under assault by the most powerful country in the entire world.  Supporters cried out once again that they were "liberating" the country from the grip of "dictatorship", but the truth was, the United States was taking care of unfinished business from over a decade earlier, and removing weapons that were  potentially  hazardous to their allies like Kuwait and possibly Israel.  The war raged on, and lies spewed forth from its opposers.  According to them, the United States was in a quagmire.  Indeed, a quagmire so quick that within months the Iraqis went from oppressed to trouncing through the streets, defacing the remants of Iraq's former dictator.  But, like every country that had ever been converted from an authoritarian regime to a government based upon the principles of democracy, Iraq would take time.  The crime rate rose, troupes of Saddam supporters continued their defensive combat for the country, and people discounted the prospects of democracy in Iraq.  All the while, the military failed to find these "weapons of mass destruction".  Sure, there were evidences of Saddam's disregard for the U.N. resolutions like SCUD missiles.  Now, the majority of America is opposed to the war effort in Iraq.  It started as a much smaller movement, led with a front of pacifists and neo-hippies.  But, the support for the war has floundered, dropping little by little each month.  Now, according to  urlLink this article  by Channel NewsAsia, an international news website, "fifty-two percent of Americans believe the Iraq war was not worth fighting."  Not a large margin, but still a majority.  But, one fact has still been with held from the general population, in light of the 9-11 Commissions findings: the fact that two cases of "weapons of mass destruction" were discovered in Iraq, as evidenced by  urlLink this article  by WorldNetDaily.  The story, which has gained only minimal media support, is actually rather damning to the cries that this war to find "weapons of mass destruction" was misguided, and that the American public was lied to.  One of the attacks was a bomb explosion in which the bomb contained sarin nerve agent; the other was a mustard gas shell used as part of a improvised explosive device.  The shell is believed to be one of the 550 of the like that Hussein failed to account for to the United Nations.  So, in all of this, where does the blaim lie?  How about blaiming both sides?  The truth is, even though the United States, with president Bush at the helm, was write about "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq, and possibly these sketchy ties between Hussein and members of Islamic-extremist terrorist groups, the United States has failed to show in any remarkable way how Iraq was a "terrorist" country, and was in any way going to participate in an attack against the United States or its allies.  If the United States is going to route this mindset from the region, and remove these sadistic murderers, they need to focus less on the sovereign nations and focus more on the cat-and-mouse tactics for finding the real enemy -- the terrorists.  War between two sovereign nations is a much different case than one nation tracking down those responsible for the murder of almost three thousand individuals on September 11th, and those responsible for numerous other barbaric murders around the region against "infidels" such as Jews, Americans, and even now a Korean.  But, on the other side lies the political slant and media bias in America towards the Democratic view of things.  The Democrats are outspoken against this war, and anything that appears to be going bad in it will undoubtedly help their presidentail candidate, John Kerry, in the upcoming elections.  The fact that the major media and news networks overlooked or disregarded just about everything pro-America and pro-war both in Iraq and this country, coupled with this dismissal of blatant illegal chemical weapons in Iraq proves just how far they will go to put their man in office.  So, to finally tie this thing up, I suppose the only conclusion I can give any of you is that neither George Bush, nor John Kerry deserve your vote.  In fact, I can't find one candidate who would serve this country well.  But, like I plan on doing with every one of these posts, I'll provide you with both a thoughtful and related quote, this one by Henry Steele Commager: "Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive."

       Ahh, the world of blogging.  The land of mental charlatans in a battle of wits, locked into an everlasting struggle containing both entertainment and fury.  It's the area of the web where every person can make their own opinion heard (though it's typically ignored or overlooked anyways) for others to agree with or mock.  The blog represents a shift in time where the individual is heard more than the whole, but where the power of the whole is often preached.  It's arguably the most important and influential creation on the internet since the internet itself.  Even more than time-consuming websites, the blog gives us all our own voice among the world.  It can be more powerful than books, or weaker than silence.  So, if you even care about this blog at all, you're probably wondering why I started this one; why I bothered to spend my time sharing thoughts with all of you.  Well, I've already answered it: I want to share my thoughts with all of you.  Feel free to dismiss them, ignore them, refute them, berate them, or even (and I doubt this) agree with them.  This particular blog was started mostly for political purposes, to suit my own opinions in matters.  I'll be the first to tell you that most everyone who reads this will  not  agree with what I say.  I'm an anarchist, a strong believer in extreme freedoms in every aspect of life, and a supporter in ignoring the whole, and examining the self.  To lead us into this journey of self-praises and self-importance I offer you this quote, by the master of words Ralph Waldo Emerson: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesman and philosophers and divines.  With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do."

       The political arena has had quite an interesting effect on the world of words, and it isn't quite something new. Political pundits have twisted various words throughout the years, defacing some and redefining others, though alwasy incorrectly. They choose to ignore the truth about what something might specifically be, and instead label the term horrible, and attach it to all forms of things they despise.    I think the most prevalent bastardised terms have to be "conservative" and "liberal". The terms have been adopted by both the Republican and Democratic parties to describe their own practices, when often it is nothing of the sort. But, they've also turned into derogatory terms when used by those of the opposite persuasion. For instance, the term "conservative" has been twisted by the Republicans to support such things as the Iraqi War and anti-homosexual marriage legislation, when in fact both issues are directly contradictory to the word itself. True American conservatism was established during the period around the ratification of the United States Constitution. It developed from those opinions held by the Federalist party, and eventually came to mean an emphasis on smaller, though strong, government, semi-isolationism (only interventionalism in extreme cases), and strict adherence to the Constitution. Now, while conservatism correctly stands for less or smaller government, the Republicans and their self-labeled "right-wing" policies have planted the notion that "right" on the political spectrum means less government, which is something wholly incorrect. Often times Republicans will claim they are the party seeking smaller government, all the while enacting new legislation to restrict marriage and set laws such as those in the USA Patriot Act in action.    Equally misused is the term "liberal", having been connotated with "left-wing" policies by both sides. Classic liberalism was based on the doctrines of less government is better, often emboldening minarchism, and social progress. But, only one of these is correct about the Democrats who use the term for themselves, and the Republicans who slander them with it -- social progress. But, even in the world of social progress, the Democratic Party takes a much different route then a true classic liberal in that rather than taking the power from the government, they place more power in its hands, thus going against the other principle of liberalism. They want Affirmative Action in place to "help"  some  minorities, when the truth is, the only way to make minorities less like minorities is to through of the concepts of different races in the United States, and accept everyone as part of the group. As long as they continue to place blacks or hispanics away from the rest of society, the large the gaps will be between those peoples and the rest of society. Another example is the issue of homosexual marriage. While I feel homosexuals should have the advantage of being married like every other couple out there, I think the underlying fact remains that marriage has no place in the government anyways. It is just another right that the government has  stolen  from us, only to give it back to us in bits as a privilege. The fact that these "liberals" support government control over marriage in the first place is contrary to actual liberal thought.    Of course, those are most definitely not the only terms highly misused. Another prime example is that of Communism. Back in the mid-nineteenth century when Communism first made its appearance to the world through the  Communist Manifesto  of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels it was a much different entity than it is now. In 1917 when Russia first started its transformation to Communism under the flawed concepts of V. I. Lenin and his Communist Party, a trend was started that would carry through for many decades in many different areas of the world. Powerful revolutionaries with flawed concepts like Lenin's would spark governmental overthrows that would all eventually fail before true Communism was ever accomplished. Rather than a true Anarchist society like Marx prophecised about, the powerful revolutionaries did not dissolve their control, and instead ended up creating horribly oppressive, totalitarian states ruled by the iron first of the Communist Parties. But, rather than recognising these failed attempts at Communism as the oppressive, totalitarian states they in fact are, the term Communism was still applied. An entire philosophy of socially progressive political science was tainted by the acts of these new dictators and the millions of people they massacred for their "causes".    Or, how about libertarianism, the term that has been dictated by the American Libertarian Party into something that it's not quite. True libertarianism is extremely close to classic liberalism, and is pretty much established on the same belief that less government is better. It even stretches to the extreme of outright Anarchism. Libertarianism, being one end of the Libertarian-Authoritarian scale of the political compass, is affected by the Right-Left scale of the political compass as well. Thus, both left-wing variants, like those of Noam Chomsky, and right-wing variants, like that of the American Libertarian Party, exist.  Of course, the extreme of Libertarianism, Anarchism, has become one of the most -- if not the most -- bastardised political terms.  What started as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's term for a stateless society has now morphed into some sort of lawless chaos -- something that most definitely not intended.  The term, which describes multiple political doctrines spreading the Left-Right spectrum, is much different to the many dictionary definitions it has acquired over the years.  Anarchist societies in theory are very orderly and free, not chaotic and repressive.  Anarchy, what has become the term for absolute lawlessness, is much different than Anarchism, the correct term for an orderly, advanced society operating sans state run control.    So, what does all of this mean?  Well not much if no one cares.  Most people will still be content with using incorrect terms and definitions, and revel in their horrible diction because it might help them slander one another, or support their point a bit more.  It's easier to debate "Communism" when you use the false definitions and practices of brutal dictators rather than the ingenius social structures invisioned by Karl Marx.  It's easier to combat "liberalism" when it has been adopted by big-government supporters with fancifully retarded ideals, rather than the fact that true liberals want less government and more freedom.  It's easier to take a moral high ground behind the term of "conservatism" because it stands for small government and Constitutionalism, when in fact you are for just the opposite.  I guess Emma Goldman was completely correct when she said, "The political arena leaves one no alternative, one must either be a dunce or a rogue."

       For thousands of years, many men have had one dream in mind -- to gain and hold power for the sake of having power -- a dream that still holds true to this day through greed and general oppression.  From the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt to the totalitarian dictators of the USSR and China, power has been a leading motive in the massacres of millions of people for one ideal or another.  Imperialism was power's offspring, the next expansion of power, and the new frontier for megalomaniacs to expand into.  Through imperialism, these men gain new dominion and more subjects to dictate, and typically they are never content to just stop.  Through the ages, imperialism has held many faces, from the oppressive, land-hungry tyrant seeking even more power, to the supposedly good-will emperors bent on "helping" the world through conversion.  And, while modern imperialism had found it's new threat in the United States, it now has its new ally.    Foreign policy since World War I has steadily grown from classic isolationism, typically a staple of American conduct, to full out imperialism.  Since the dawn of the Cold War, the United States has embroiled itself in more foreign conflicts than ever before, looking to spread its own ideals and principles to the world, and eliminate the spread of those doctrines it opposed.  The United States placed itself at the forefront of a conflict with pseudo-Communism, fighting its expansion in multiple wars such as Korea and Vietname, costing many thousands of American lives, when it should have had no place in this stalemate to begin with.  Since when has America become the world's father figure, rather than its beacon of hope?    But, it hasn't stopped there.  With the recent (the last couple decades) influx of neo-conservatism, America has found itself at the forefront of more conflicts of ideals than ever before.  It has become the self-appointed wall between terrorism and the rest of the world, which could possibly end up becoming the forced spreading of American ideals and principles to the rest of the world on a much grander scale than ever before.  Soon conflicts to get revenge on our enemies in Afghanistan morphed into re-fueled feuds with sovereign countries.  The resulting Iraqi War, quite possibly the largest abomination in American foreign policy history, was fought for every excuse under the son, with new ones popping up as its supporters thought of them.  When its main reasoning, national defense, was shot down by a lack of support, and undermined by the emergence of the truth of the poor intelligence behind it, the main focus soon turned to the "freedom" of the Iraqi populace from the reign of Saddam Hussein.  Only one problem still existed: the Iraqi populace didn't support this forced freedom.    Now, what we have is America once again forcing its own ideals upon the rest of the world, even when they are not supported and unwanted.  Supporters of this form of American imperialism feel it is their right and responsibility to spread their beliefs to the rest of the world, but where does this premise arise?  Why does this premise even exist?  The best I can figure is that this arises from conceit in ones own country and its accomplishments, stemming from overzealous nationalism.  This same kind of mindset is typically found in religions that seek to spread and convert their messages to everyone else, even to those that don't welcome it.  And when looked at in this light, the thought occurred to me: what is so different between the "Islamofascism" of the Middle East and  Islam itself to spread its ideals and religion to everyone else through coercion, and the United States's policy of spreading its ideals to everyone else through coercion?  About the only difference I can see is that the United States doesn't intentionally target civilians while the radical Muslim terrorists do, and that's it.    So, how does freedom spread itself if not by imperialism?  Typically by a yearning and desire for it, making the oppressed willing enough to fight for it.  The phrase, "where there's a will, there's a way," comes to mind.  Take the American, French, and Russian revolutions for example, where the oppressed weren't forced into a revolution by an outside force, but rather by the inside insistance of the actual citizens of those countries.  I think James Baldwin said it best with the statement: "Freedom is not something that anybody can be given.  Freedom is something people take, and people are as free as they want to be."
