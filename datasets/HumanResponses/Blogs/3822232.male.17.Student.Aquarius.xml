						   find it heart-aching when i heard my friend was being soooooo rude to his parent. what happened was tt his parent was asking him to eat properly in the hostel instead of eating out. but this friend of mine just dont appreciate his parent's effort of worrying for him and used a really really rude tone when answering back.. and asked his parent not to mention the topic ever again and said tt he regret telling his parent about what he did outside.. what the..?!?!   what happen to the teenagers nowadays??? sometimes i wonder.. isnt it great to have someone to worry for us? arent we suppose to be grateful to our parents who always take care of us since we were born?? oh ya.. maybe because he's the only child.. tt's y.. but i dont think this reason is good enough to justify his actions.. really felt like standing up and give him a punch directly in his face. but for the sake of our friendship, i didnt do tt... am i doing the right thing? i'm not sure.. and yea.. recently he uses more and more vulgar language.. it's as if he just use those f words like nobody's business.. but.. haix.. i hope i can keep my temper down and endure it..   the conversation between my friend and his parent just worsened my mood.. today was so busy and yea.. so many things happened.. went to find ms ong in the morning and afternoon but she wasnt there.. and put the letter on her table, which was already late.. haix.. hope i get the chance to explain to her personally tmr..   then i had a one-to-one session with mr. choe.. he wasnt very satisfied with the members on duty during college day and its rehearsal. what happened was tt there were ppl running awa halfway thru the rehearsal and thus they are not in the know about things tt were happening on the actual day.. so.. even thou me and jun wen went there on the actual day (where we werent suppose to be there cos we were not on duty) and help the crews to set up equipment in the auditorium, everything were done in a rush.. and mr. choe said tt we seriously need to work on our efficiency.. and we talked about exco jobscope.. he set expectations for this batch of exco and at the end of the meeting, he asked about the crews who are suppose to be down for NDP celebration, which the exco has not come up with a list of ppl, and i told him tt it's not ready, he looked angry and disappointed.. i want to make changes to the club.. but sometimes it's really easier said than done. even for my exco members, they are not as committed as before le.. like for today's exco meeting, some of them were like rushing and kept asking me to skip points and things tt i wanted to tell them.. i was quite irritated by that.. maybe i was too long-winded? &nbsp;maybe it's my fault.. haix.. am i capable enough to be a leader? i question myself.. but i could find no ans..   when i came back, i found tt i had soooo many things to be done. tutorials, revisions, prep for investiture, pw and asean nite.. talked to my father 2 days ago.. i told him tt i'm really stressed up here.. maybe i took up too much responsibility from the start le.. really envy tt m room mate can have so much free time.. guess what?? he is playing games almost every nite lor.. and i'm like.. even if i work non-stop, i still doubt if i can finish the works that i want to do.. a lot of things.. really too much..   something frustrating followed tt.. su san called me.. she is the overall ic for asean dance nite. currently, we are short of budget to organise the event. there are 2 ways to solve. either we collect more money from the scholars or we get subsidy from MOE. for the second option, MOE said tt we will only get the subsidy if we get at least 10% of the participants to be locals. ya.. some of us agreed to the idea of getting singaporeans to join but some were opposing the idea. they want to make this event singaporean-free.. i was wondering again.. what the??? what is the PROBLEM with them?? is there anything wrong with singaporeans? since there are empty seats and spaces, why dont we just invite&nbsp;local friends for&nbsp;free? since it's goingt to save us lots of trouble trying to persuade local friends to go and pay $15 for tt and we'll get near $1000 from MOE subsidy in return.. dont u think tt it's ridiculous? i mean.. the locals&nbsp;wont know anyone there except a few of us in the same college, and yet they have to pay to attend this stupid function, which only serves unlimited drinks without food? what's the point????? su san said tt each college SLs have to find at least 4 singaporeans to attend the function. but yea.. guess what? i'll just ignore her lor.. do u think i'll ask my friends to pay $15 and go there and rot and even worse---get discriminated?? i'll tell u straight away.. NO.. and i wont give a damn to tt lor..   gg to do work again.. have to get lots of things done before the end of the week.. esp the cca stuff.. HCPA is not something tt is as slack as what i used to have in MTech, CHS..  i think this will be the longest entry i've ever written.. i feel kinda relieved after voicing out everything in the blog.. i hope tt i can get well again when i wake up tmr.. seeya and gd nite~

						   若我是树，这棵树上只有一片叶子；    今天换换胃口，来华文的。哈 =P  早上懒洋洋的，起身的时间不迟不早，刚好赶上最后的那几份不太好吃但不吃又觉得可惜的早餐。所以，今早拖着既疲惫，又沉重的脚步朝餐厅走去。早餐吃罢就开始做功课。到目前为止，赶上进度的功课就只有英文和物理。其他的嘛...改天再说吧 =P  接近午间，父亲来了。聊了一会儿，吃过点心便分手。既不拖拉，也不累赘，简直就是干净利落。哈～想家吗？还好吧，曾尝试连续好几个月没回家。当初会签下那一纸合约，可能心理上早已做好背水一战的决心。接下去的几个月，我都可能回不了家了。顿时想起当年华岗文学奖“回不了的家”那个作文题目。哈～九月是会有另一个学生领袖营。嘿，就在大考前几个星期也...但是这是教育部筹办的，错过了又会觉得可惜，所以就参加咯。希望影响不要太大就好了。  下午出门，到市区逛逛，陪牛买了件礼物，接着四处乱走。最后在滨海艺术中心停下脚步。看了会儿街边艺术表演，到一角说话、看简讯、看人、看事。夜深时回到室内，买面包充饥，再找7-11报仇。哈～爽快。  接下来的一个月将是十分难熬的一个月，除了忙，还是忙；不只我忙，牛也忙。只盼我俩能顺利熬过。回想当年，我是多么的期盼初院精彩缤纷的生活，但现在我却怀念当初悠闲自在的日子。前者后者截然不同。这种矛盾，也是我当初完全没有预料到的。尽管如此，我还是不希望就此被困难打倒。不行...太不值了。  好了，又得与大家暂别了。下来的几天也不知道是否有机会上网、写日记。无论如何，希望大家保重～晚安。=)    若叶子想离去，这将不会是棵不挽留叶子的树...

						   today dont have net access. so i wrote this entry in notepad first and just transfered it to my blog..  hmm.. sort of xia4 dao4 when i got back cos i found that my water bottle was still full.. then i realised tt i didnt drink an water when i was in sch for the whole day.. =P erm.. but i did drink some during lunch time.. so it's still not so bad.. =)  today was an interesting day.. i was late for my pw cos i was doing PA morn duty and Mr. Choe talked to some of us after the assenbly then i couldn't find the correct classroom which i was supposed to go.. didnt know tt there was a chamge in classroom. then surprisingly Mrs. Lee didnt scold me =) was lucky indeed =P  again i was impressed by myself tt i managed to keep myself awake for the dreadful 4 hrs in auditorium.. double phy, double bio lect followed by CT. but undoubtedly today's CT session was the best (i think) among all the others which i had in the past. mu4 chuan2 sent down a band of performers to HC and performed.. sang songs bla bla.. they are really zai3 lor.. hmm.. yupyup.  was supposed to go and do lib duty but i was too lazy to do so.. so i came back, slacked ard and finally i started revisions at nite.. finished mitosis and cell structures and SHM basics.. haix.. couldnt understand much during lect even thou i managed to keep myself awake.. =P  am expecting a looooong and tiring day tmr.. have to wake up early everyday from now on cos Mr. Choe wants to see the me, my VP and HRM during morn assembly EVERYDAY.. meaning i have to go sch early everyday.. hmm.. less time to slp and tt's all.. thou not sure abt his intention, but i think being responsible, i shall go. after all, if i dont set a good eg, how am i suppose to motivate the rest of the club to be enthu?? yah.. so.. jia you ba~ =)  hmm.. i think i shall look thru the organic chem notes and make sure i can understand what Ms. Tan taught us last time.. really cant afford to spend extra time to learn those thing myself le.. had been doing to for term 2.. slp during lectures and learnt the things myself.. this method is not workable.. TESTED and PROVEN by Lai Yi Feng of HCJC.. so.. ya.. dont think i want to do tt again.. it's just.. cant get me anywhere further than CEO. haix..  again, jia you ba.. really have to be serious abt academic stuff le.. so.. i am going to shift my main focus to academic.. after all, the words from the scholarship officer reminded me this. she said we are here to study, not to do well in competitions and cca.. main priority shall go to studies.. so.. yea..  okie.. upon realising tt i have to do extremely WELL for my promos, i think i shld get back to work le.. seeya tmr, niteZ diary and niuZ =)

						   today is a dreadful day. got back 3 papers and i think those kind of results are the worst test resutls i've ever got in my life lor.. really think i have to start working and revise things le.. haix.. shldnt have played tt much during blk test period.. guess what? i played more than i studied during the BLK TEST period leh.. haix..  hey, room mate gone le.. went to germany liaoz.. will be lonely.. ha! erm.. things will get kinda troublesome without him. no internet server for the rest of the 2 weeks unless occasionally my other friend can come and take up his role lor..  so i'm not sure whether i can come online and see u all or not for the coming 2 weeks. maybe i will, occasionally.. ya.. erm.. think life without net can be a blessing too ba.. perspective changed.. so fast? err.. yea. =P  yup, shldnt complain abt my results anymore. i sort of deserve it cos i know how much effort have i put in for my revisions.. cant blame anyone else except myself.  and ya.. history shall not repeat itself. i'll try my best not to let such *tragedy occur again. i'll jia you!! and i want to prove a phenomenon to be faulty so i have to work even harder.  yupyup, say goodbye to the games in my com..

						   Horror gripped the heart of the World War 1 soldier, as he saw his  lifelong friend fall in battle. Caught in a trench with continuous gunfire's  whizzing over his head, the soldier asked his lieutenant if he might go out into the "no man's land" between the trenches to bring his fallen comrade back.  "You can go," said the lieutenant, "but i don't think it will be worth  it. Your friend is probably dead and you may throw your life away." The lieutenant's didn't matter, and the soldier went anyway. Miraculously  he managed to reach his friend, hoist him onto his shoulder and bring him back to their company's trench.  As the two of them tumbled in together to the bottom of the trench, the officer checked the wounded soldier, and then looked kindly at his friend. "I told you it wouldn't be worth it," he said. "Your friend is dead and you are mortally wounded." "It was worth it, though, sir," said the  soldier.  "How do you mean, worth it?" responded the Lieutenant. "Your friend is  dead"  "YES, Sir" the private answered. "But it was worth it because when i  got to him, he was still alive and i had the satisfaction of hearing him say, "JIM........, I KNEW YOU'D COME."  (Take sometime to think about the story then stroll down)       Many times in life, whether a thing is worth doing or not, really  depends on how u look at it. Take up all your courage and do something your heart tells you to do so that you may not regret not doing it later in your life...  "May each and every one of you be blessed with the company of true  friends." "A true friend is one who walks in, when the rest of the world walks out."

S7 had bio make-up lecture. and cos there is this story-telling competition in the afternoon, the flower pots were there and the lecture mics and projectors were removed. and.. me and jun wen had to go and help.. only the 2 of us went down and help and we had a lot to do lor.. not like normal troubleshooting, but rather.. setting up the whole system from finding the power extension. mr. haw was late i guess.. cos 8++ he was still not in school.. he is suppose to report at 8 right? or earlier? i dunno.. then cos of tt, we dont have access to control room, the sound system, the lecture mic and power extensions. thus, what we did was to go all the way to the backstage and find power extension. luckily i found it.. and sadly, no lecture mic. and the wooden cuboard was locked!! we dismantled the lock and later put it back.. no choice.  2 pts i'm quite angry abt: no other exco nor members came down to help.. hey, S7 leh.. not a small fac right? and mr. haw wasnt ard when we need his keys. and he didnt even bother to come to audi and check when he arrived? at least provide a lecture mic? his explanation was: err.. how come got last minute event? thou i dont think it's last minute thingy. at least i think ms ong did inform mrs chin abt it way before hand.  yea.. quite angry throughout the lecture. ms ong had to shout for 2 periods and i couldnt do anything without the keys.  in the afternoon my pw grp went to HPB for a forum. ha.. surprisingly we had full attendance. =) and the session was v fruitful. conducted 2 interviews with doctors, one of them was ex-HCian.. =) and we delegated the job of the report quite well too.. everyone is doing job. =)  in the evening, went to ASEAN Nite. this was a success =) glad to say tt. all the drinks, roses, dances and LOUD musics were unforgetable. i'll go next year too.. but the new com next year will organise it =P at times, i was irritated by the musics tt were TOO LOUD. and i went to lobby to rest. this happened quite frequently.. and something not *right.. other than the performance, what i did was just fooled ard with the guys tt we used to study together in CHS. had fun thou, but not from the rock dances or slow dances.. ha.. when other ppl were happily dancing, i volunteered to sell roses.. =P yea.. hope to contribute to the com too.. quite pity my partner thou but.. yea.. guess i cant do anything abt it? cos my zi4 zhi4 li4 too good? =P ha.. something interesting.. didnt know tt SCHOLARS can get so... siao~ during the dances. they seemed to be MAD.. and some of the couples.. eee~ they were... haix.. luckily MOE officers didnt see them.. did they even come? =P i doubt so.. but they were REALLY OPEN-MINDED.. ha.. was like watching movie all the time.. =P=P  back to hostel at 1++.. and now is approaching 3 le.. i guess i'll sleep after updating the blog ba.. yup.. =) tt's all i think. seeya~niteZ everyone~~~

						   on the word fuck  the word fuck was antecedently a proscribed, repugnant term used most commonly for expressing acrimony or petulance. the use of this word is unthinkable and demeritorious in antiquity. however, with the ostensible augmentation of society and culture, the proliferation of this word has become as colloquial as the drivel of tides. even burgeoning adolescents are no stranger to the meanings of this abominable word. this will ultimately lead to the decadence of society, and a disintegration of eons of corporated axioms. in retrospect, i assert my absolute, unmitigated abhorrence and anathema to the mere utterance of this manifestly calumniating and undubitably castigating of the word fuck.  adapted from SBMS blog, credits given to lak.

						   paiseh, i saw it le.. these few words were scary enough. but i guess sooner or later he'll know abt it too.. cos the com is shared mah.. yah.. so, cannot slack further liao.. reasons for it are quite clear le i guess..  today was quite fun. had national day celebration this morning and a lot of ppl were v high during the performances and the mass singing session.. hmm.. found tt mr. pang's job as a dm is not easy. cos he had to make sure tt the students were discipline enough not to pon or do stupid things.. however, sadly, there were ppl ponning right after morning assembly. the went off in batches.. saw them from the start till the end. the first few batches went off successfully wihout being caught. the next few ones were less fortunate. 2 of them actually came up the slope (the circular pathway with the rock-climbing facility in the middle) and met mr. pang face to face!! then guess what did they do?? they ran!! ha.. and mr. pang was like.. walking SLOWLY as if he didnt worry that the students could run away from him. then he came back with 3 students following.. guess the 3 of them were doomed.. =P but AT THE SAME TIME as they walked up the slope, another group of students consisting of 3 gals escaped!! and mr pang wasnt able to see cos there were things in between them to block them from seeing each other. the gals were quite fortunate indeed~  after the celebration today, it was terrible.. had stock-taking.. we only did 2 venues (audi and PA room) and we were like... x_x it took us A LOT of time to get things out and clasify the items in PA room. i overestimated our efficiency and asked niuZ to come down by 1230.. was a wrong move cos the whole thing ended at ard 2++ and niuZ was like.. stoning at her class bench. sry sry..  went to bugis after lunch to get back a sheng1.. ha.. quite heavy indeed. then went to suntec and did constructive things there =) after tt went to carrefour to take a look at the prices of the cakes and buns.. gg to get them on wed for the investiture on friday.. fri 13.. ha. someone was asking abt it over yahoo grp. but what to do? quite a number of the ppl ESP the EXCO MEMBERS wanted it on fri, which i didnt think it's a good idea. i actually did try to change it to sat but again, i faced strong objections from some ppl.. esp one of my exco members, which i dont intend to mention her name here since so many ppl are reading the blog. no personal attack..  went passed marche, as usual, kept on sniffing.. ha.. erm.. bought 2 packets of jambu air as well.. quite cheap. $2 for 2 packets. and inside each packets, there were 10+ jambus.. ha. zhuan4 dao4 le.. =P  attended asean dance prac at nite. did a simple briefing so tt the other scholars have a clearer idea of what's gg to happen.  sleeping soon.. worn out le.. seeya everybody~ niteZ.

						   today lessons ended at ard 320. then met bumin and keith. talked and talked for nearly 40 minutes. we were talking abt MTech, PA and... rubbish. after tt went back to hostel.  went out w xt to suntec to buy a notebook. then met the whole photoc exco at the bk there.. ha.. dunno whether it's because they bak3 jiu1 tak4 stamps or i was transparent, they didnt see me!! ha.. i thought it was another case of bei fa xian, but then apparently it wasnt. met the pres and wanxin at the newton bus stop. they only knew tt i was there by tt time.. ha  erm.. investiture.. something tt looks simple but lotsa prep have to be done.. was a good lesson to be leant thou.. erm.. i dont know.. something really disappointing.. i was soooo busy settling things for the investiture and people dont think tt i was working. thou i spent a lot of time on this, but i still appear as a pres who did nothing much. i have nothing to say abt this. just kinda disappointed cos nobody seems to be recognising my efforts?  something comforting: my exco members do understand me and they actually suggested tt i delegate part of my jobs to other ppl. at least they know i did things. maybe i shall try to learn tt the greatest credit for my work is self-satisfaction ba.. what to do? ppl working behind the scenes..  tmr ndp celebrations and stock-taking. hope it's not gg to be too tiring.. =)  niteZ everyone. me gg to slp soon. seeya tmr~~

						   READING THIS BLOG!!  erm.. okay ba.. quite glad tt i've not been forgotten.. =P  erm.. Mr. Lee was complaining abt me not mentioning chemistry in this blog.. ha.. so.. i shall do so today.. err.. cant think of a way to prove the qn mathematically althou i know that the total amt of Ea lowered by the catalyst for both forward and backward rxn are the same, and therefore there is no change in eqm position, and so no dif in kc.. but.. how to porve it mathematically? i think there shld be a v simple way.. just tt i cant think of it.. yea..  somemore chemistry.. Mr. Pang msg me just now.. asking me to see him tmr before sch starts.. wonder what is he up to.. err.. hope not something scary.. asked him what is it abt.. he said he wanted to give something to my pa crews.. err.. dunno..  today quite slack.. tmr got chi hist test.. all the way from prehistoric china (apprx 180 million years ago) till the end of the 3 kindoms and wei4 jin4 nan2 bei3 chao2. err.. read thru the notes le.. but i think i'll just remember the main pts and crap my way thru ba.. =P  went to do an interview this afternoon.. approached all 5 optic shops in BTP but only 1 was kind enough to accept it.. after tt, wrote a 5-page interview report and dont intend to print them out yet.. cos i dont have printer!! =P  tonite was a fruitful one.. did a lot of things.. saw a mek eaten by moo.. so cruel... saw ppl fishing and got bit by sharks!! ha.. pit the one got repeatedly bit by sharks.. tt's something unforgetable thou.. =P tonite.. the sentry guards were quite slack.. by right, they shld guard the right hand side but by left, even when ppl are passing by, they didnt give warning.. erm.. was like -_-ll nvm.. this made the whole thing fun.. =P fun?!?! hmm.. sort of ba.. oh ya, and i took a longest bus ride ever.. 1 hr plus plus.. but i was studying chi hist on the bus.. so not time-wasting ya? =p oh ya.. mutton tt was found somewhere else taste nice too.. yummy =)=)  today is a day of discoveries.. ha.. discovered a lot of things.  okie.. shall stop here tonite.. niteZ and seeya =)
