      Okay, so I have a workshop tonight. It's my second one outside my house (where I normaly have stamp camps). 10 women. Ugh. Luckily I'm all packed and all I have to do now is wait till 5pm. Personal note: Gotta remember to stop at walgreens on the way.  Kids are driving me a lil nutz today, but right now they're quiet. Just wish I could spend the rest of the day zoning out, or screaming at the top of my lungs. Which ever.  DH is crabby too. Which makes me feel guilty. I'm leaving the kids behind while I do my workshop, and he's crabby. Why in the hell should I feel guilty? Does he feel guilty when he goes to work everyday? I'm just going to work. Stop feeling guilty already!  OOoops... gotta go grab the laundry. BTW: I HATE LAUNDRY. It Never Stinkin Ends!!! But I need something clean to wear tonite... so, I beeter go.

       Mom on a Mission. What mission?       Not only do I have a teenage daughter (14 going on 15 in Sept) but also a 3 year old, going on 4 in Oct, daughter and a 14 month old son. I'm a Stay at Home Mom with lots of hobbies. I'm also a wife and domestic... hmmm... not a goddess, but something like that. Dishes, Laundry, keeping the kids clean, fed, and dressed, and keeping the house looking normal. Taking the kids to playgroups, swimming, and other social activities. I'm an artist. Been drawing, painting, mosaicing, and crafting for over 10 years now. I've joined the arts guild in my area again. I'm a member, and leader, of a local moms group. I plan on joining the PTA once my daughter enters school in Sept (K3). I have a small home business selling rubber stamps that's started out slow, but it's picking up pretty quickly as I go.  I'm pagan. I celebrate our holidays and try to teach my little ones open mindedness, kindness, and respect for all nature and humanity.  I'm sure there's more to me that escapes my mind right now.      My mission... To keep  SANE !

      I have jury duty today and tomorrow.  A part of me DREDS this. I am not looking forward to spending the day at the public court house with a bunch of strangers some of which look homeless, waiting, and Hoping I don't get picked for a jury. Sitting thru some boring trial. Waiting patiently for the next break. Wandering aimlessly durring the lunch break. Etc...  A part of me is looking forward to it. Why?  A day without the kids!!  I'm bringing my catalog, a notebook for making a wish list, an Ann Rice book, a list of addresses, a bunch of cards I made and sending out my RAKS for the month. Being myself. Being by myself. Doing the little things that I look over on a daily basis. A whole day without kids... sounds too good to be true.   But it's a day of jury duty...   So, I'm torn as to whether or not this will be good or  bad .

      I'm a terrible bloger.  Okay, I need to summerize my last 3 days.  Sunday: Party went well, a few too many damn people. But went great sales wise. We relaxed most of the day. ASked my mom to borrow money. She puts me thru some hell, and we watch 6 feet under (Wow, Claire! A Lesbian... really?) and go to bed.  Monday: Play group here. Only Jill and Tami show. We close Tami's party. I put order in. Run to bank. Throw newsletters into mail box. Relax. Figure out dinner. Watch Monster House (it's to be continued... sigh). Go to bed.  Tuesday: Work on trading card swaps. Tami calls, Take kids to Tami's. Daughter swims and plays. I leave her there. Son sleeps when I get home. YES, Some Time To My Self!!! I work on some more cards (a really cool "1st day at school card", will put in her scrapbook someday). DH comes home, cook dinner, eat, sit on computer.  There... that's about the jist of it. But I did get some good news. My friend in West Bend is 5 wks pregnant! YAY! I'm so happy for her. They're still going thru with the adoption too... from empty home to full family. I really admire her! Oh, and her husband too. They've been trying for years. This is really great news!   Okay... maybe I'll keep up with this.   But I'm just such a terrible blogger!
