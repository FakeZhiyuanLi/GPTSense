      Today's topic from  urlLink my book : Direct Taxes.    It seems some Republicans (you know, the fiscally conservative party) are spending $60 million of our tax dollars to prevent suicide by college students.  The story on the Senator Smith sponsored bill is  urlLink here .  Near the end of the story, it mentions that 30,000 people kill themselves a year.  Sen. Smith's  urlLink press release  puts number of youths that the bill is focusing on at 3,000.  So it's $60 million bucks to try to save 3,000 kids-or $20,000 each.  Thas is if the program is totally successful.  If only 10% (300 kids) are saved from themselves, which I think is optimistic, that means the per life cost is $200,000.  The Senate will pass this bill because one of their own is crying over his kids, but I'm not responsible for that and their making me pay for it.  My own family is marred by suicide in each generation that I know about often multiple times and I would gladly pay $20,000 or $200,000 to get them back, but I'm not forcing others to cough up the money.  What Sens Smith, et al is doing is taking money already wrongly taxed away from the productive sector into the public sector.  Each little chip like this lowers the productive, gains and wealth we might have.

      No, I'm not going to advocate massive consumer regulation.  Check out my  urlLink book .  I'll live by this stuff.   But I also believe in spreading the news about a company ripping off the public, so here I go.  I was very hungry for an early dinnner and bought an Uncle Ben's Rice Bowl for $2 at Kroger.  It looked big and hearty.  One fork in and I hit bottom.  Was I optically alluded?  Nope, the bowl has a dimple in the bottom much like wine bottles have and for much the same  urlLink reason .  They tricked me.  The big bowl I thought I was getting was about half the size presented.  I don't believe the government should regulate this but I will encourage all readers to not buy Uncle Ben's Rice Bowl.

      I'm still drowsy and lazy from my recent surgery but I'm getting restless and bored.&nbsp; I'm down to watching Tivo'd  Mad About You  clip shows.&nbsp; My favorite pastime is to watch for when Helen Hunt's chest explodes into a wonderfully rounded bosom.  &nbsp;  Finally, I turned on the news and caught the announcement&nbsp;that Martha Stewart's getting 5-months in the pokey.&nbsp; I'll be honest about this:&nbsp; I haven't followed the case at all.&nbsp; I just gave Martha the benefit of the doubt and figured the prosecutor's were going after an easy and unpopular target.&nbsp; But I figured I'd find out what she did....and no one on the news said.&nbsp; They said she lied.&nbsp; But what was the lie?&nbsp; They didn't say.&nbsp; Maybe this is all backstory that the rest of the country knows, I thought, so I hit the web and read the actual  urlLink indictment .&nbsp; I'm going with the assumption that all items were proven.&nbsp; After giving the matter about 30 seconds of thought, I decided:&nbsp; She got what she had coming-she may have even got off easy.  &nbsp;  In case you weren't up on the specifics, what she did was this:&nbsp; she sold before&nbsp;a stock, Imclone,&nbsp;tanked after her broker's assistant gave her a head's up that the the head of&nbsp;Imclone was bailing because&nbsp;the government wasn't going to approve one of their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got that?&nbsp; Read again, if you need to.&nbsp; I did. That's not was she was indicted for.&nbsp; She was indicted for lying about it.&nbsp; Specifically, she changed phone messages from her broker, talked with the broker when instructed not to,&nbsp; and&nbsp;conspired with&nbsp;him into saying the sale was planned beforehand which is not uncommon.  &nbsp;  Now I love Martha and I think most men like her. I won't speak for the ladies.&nbsp; She's hot.&nbsp; She's fashionable, yes. Attractive, yes.&nbsp; But she has a confident manner of holding herself that to most guys says sex.&nbsp; If she wants it, she'll tell you to forego the dinner and wooing and get right to business.&nbsp; So I want to lean toward her side, but....  &nbsp;  I have my securities license, I'm familiar with the legal lectures CEOs get, and&nbsp;I can imagine what it takes to run a company like hers.&nbsp; So here's my question:&nbsp; having had her securities license and running a NYSE listed company, what was she doing actively trading her own account.&nbsp; She's in a fiduciary position and the exposure to liability that this&nbsp;entails is huge.&nbsp; She should have picked a nice money manager, have him put the assets in a blind trust and have quarterly meetings.&nbsp; This is a small amount of insurance to protect herself personally from any allegations.&nbsp; But this extents into&nbsp;her own firm-where a lot of&nbsp;her wealth is- because her name on the door.&nbsp; She should have gone out of her way&nbsp;to stay spotless.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Next, what&nbsp;is she&nbsp;doing running a company that size and dealing with these penny-ante trades trying to make a quick buck like some credit card indebted middle manager trying to score big.&nbsp; She has a responsiblity to her shareholder's to be at work for them.&nbsp; That's the other responsibility she took on when she went public.  &nbsp; Martha, I love what you've done.&nbsp; Your inpiring and motivating and you built an industry from nothing.&nbsp; You look good and like you're having fun.&nbsp; You piss off all the right people which is a big plus with me.&nbsp; But this Imclone stuff; this is cheap stuff and that's where I run into a problem, babe.  &nbsp;  Martha, my dear, you're cheap stuff.

      An addemdum to my earlier post today.   When I was twelve I watched  The Wolf Man  and thought it was cool and I still think it could be. But now nonsensical items in the movie truly ruin it for me. Didn't these items ruin it for adults back then.&nbsp; Don't they&nbsp;still?   For example, in The Wolf Man, Claude Rains plays Lon Chaney, Jr.'s father. Mr. Rains is 5'6 1/2" with a cultured English accent as befits his status as a noble. He carries an air of refinement. His "son" Lon Chaney is 6'3" and carries himself like a clumsy baffoon. Further, he speaks with an american accent filled with American colloqialisms. Except for being supposedly mentally unhandicapped, Mr. Chaney played  The Wolf Man  the same way he did Lennie in  Of Mice and Men . I just couldn't get over this. Further, in the climax little Claude kills giant Wolf Man Lon with a silver handle cane.  Sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not going to happen.  Totally ruined the movie.&nbsp; This is where my wife asks, "And this is where the reality breaks down?"&nbsp; My answer is, "YES!"&nbsp; I'll accept a couple of whoopers - men turning into wolves - for the fun of the movie, but not common sense items that could be solved.&nbsp; Possibly this is a variant on believing  urlLink THE BIG LIE ?  My question isn't so much why can't the movie people do better, but why doesn't it seem to drive anyone else nuts. I just can't see blond pixiesque Meg Ryan  urlLink playing  the niece of semetic Einstein. (Isn't she just insulting to Jews?) Or Brad Pitt playing a Greek in Troy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Greeks, I work for Greeks,&nbsp; Brad is no Greek.  The worst example is  Friends  where love lives go on and children are forgotten. The first thing parents usually say when greeting are "Where are the kids?" Never seen that on that show. Often they went unmentioned for episodes. Last week on  Monk , Monk's nurse rescued him from a stuck elevator. His first words: "Whose watching your kid?"&nbsp; Took half a second, but those points of realizm really pull the show off.   Demand it more.

      I encountered John Kerry's nuance the other night watching TV with my eldest.  This is what I heard:   Others of us find good, bad, right, wrong a many sided complex thing.  We try to see every side but the more we see the less sure we are.  No, this isn't John Kerry during an honest moment.  Or the Times editorial page explaining why Bush is simple because he sees things in black and white.  It's  urlLink Claude Rains  in 1941's  urlLink Wolf Man .  Mr. Rains played Sir John Talbot and in the above monologue is explaining to his wolfbane infected son Larry Talbot the duality of man.    It's all very good for these types of discussion while sitting in your manor house in the English country side or for John Kerry in the Senate. But out on the dark moors or in a world threatened by Islamofacist, everything is black and white.  And when confronted with a Wolf Man attacking the lovely  urlLink Gwen Conliffe , you don't discuss or debate or try to see his reasonings or try to seduce your neighbors into helping you keep the Wolf Man "in a box."  You beat hell out of him with a silver handled cane....or the US Marine Corp.

      I still don't know why  urlLink this  is good.    In effect, we unexpectedly got less stuff than we gave.  We have less stuff.    Sorry no time, just wanted to throw it out there.  Really interested in why trade deficits aren't bad, then hit that section of my  urlLink book .  Can't talk.  Need to work and get home.  Air Conditioner finally being installed tonight...I hope.  Stay you.

      Oh believe me, I can make the connection. Check out  urlLink this  article from Reuters.  Quoting in full:  NAIROBI - A Kenyan mayor ordered more than 500 pigs to be shot dead because they were mating with stray dogs, the East African Standard reported on Friday.  A squad of town council guards moved from estate to estate shooting pigs roaming free in Nyahururu town, 95 miles north of the capital Nairobi.  Town mayor Muritu Karumba said he ordered Thursday’s cull to avoid an outbreak of disease caused by the pigs and dogs mating, which he said broke the laws of nature and “caused unnecessary commotion.”  But the unfortunate pigs’ owners immediately cried foul, claiming collusion between Nyahururu’s authorities and the town’s bacon traders to cut competition in pork supplies.    Note the last paragraph, a government official, in an effort to support prices and curry favor with a particular constiuency, has eliminated a supply source.  The victims?  Of course the pig owners, but also now all the citizens who now must pay higher prices  That's why I'm glad the US is so progressive over a backward country like that.   urlLink God   urlLink Bless  the  urlLink USA .

       urlLink Here  it is.  Not a whole lot, but thought it would be interesting to those following it.  It's a year by year chart of the number of pages in the Federal Register - the total embodiment of every rule, code, and law that the Federale's imposed during the year.  Play a little game with yourself:  Stop reading right now, go to the link above and, without looking at the years, guess the presidential administration.    Done?  Good.  How'd you do? My guess is that even the slightest political junkies can tell who was in the big house when.    Three observations:  Another reason Nixon was one bad dude, Reagan said what he'd do and did it, Clinton wasn't all that bad.  First Nixon, I can't think of much that this guy did that was good.  Wage & Price controls, off the gold standard, etc, etc, etc, and now I can see the massive build up of regulations. Can't establish an EPA and not file pages with regs now can you? Is it any wonder that we had malaise during this time.  Plus it was the 70's and everything was just ugly.  I know someone's going to e-mail, "Yeah, but he went to China."  I'm truly undecided about that.  If president, I would hate for my finest accomplishment to be open dialoge and hence endorsement with a murdurous totalitarian regime.  Maybe that's just me.  Second Reagan, he said in his inaugural that government is the problem and it's reflected in the federal register.  A net decrease by my eyeballing.  Hate him or love him - he did what he said he would do.  Finally, Mr. Clinton.  Let me first say that I hate this leacherous raping Hillbilly.  But on the economic front his lack of commitment to any idealogy whatsoever and his scandals preventing the things he'd like to get done were a godsend.  The Federal Register grew slower under him that I'd expected.  Add that to NAFTA, welfare reform, the clumsy handling of his tax hikes that went down to defeat.  Not bad.  Could I even say probably better that Bush I or Dole would have done?  Yes, I think I could.  Also, if Bush or Dole won, we probably wouldn't have a presidential endorsement of the "eatin' ain't cheatin'" defense.  Stay you.

      Updated my  urlLink resume  on my  urlLink website  last night.  I used to keep it polished nicely ready for submission at any time.   See a job, snap, here's the resume.  First one there-that'll impress 'em.  Now I know.  They weren't impressed.  It went on the bottom of the pile until the next week when some HR rep sorted them out by the basics-toss this one, keep that one.  I let that practice slide.  Time to get back at it just to have it on hand.  Reviewing it does make me think.  This is the first one that I've had that doesn't list any of my college activities, accomplishments, etc.  They don't really seem important now.  4 years done and out.  Got my degree! That's all that counts.  Also, I'm having trouble remembering exactly what I did on certain line items from my past job at Fido.  I remember they were so IMPORTANT at one time.  They consumed my life.  They were IMPORTANT.  They MATTERED.  This is make or break stuff people.  POOF! Gone.  Now they don't seem to matter.  Even people's names are beginning to fade.  I know someone older, wiser, and more mature already knows this, but it's my first experience with it.  What does matter?  They're at home playing now.  Next time I stay too late at the office to finish some task when I know they need dad around.  POOF! I'm gone.  See you later Mr. Bossman.  Don't like it? Don't matter. I'll have a hard time remembering  your  name in a few years.  Oh, this all important project?  Just a line on the resume that'll I'll dump some day.

      Something astonishing just happened.&nbsp; Did you notice?&nbsp; The era of mega growth in the computer/software segment of technology has come to an end. Read in depth  urlLink here .&nbsp;&nbsp;   From the link above:     Microsoft, with more than $50 billion on hand, announced yesterday that it would bestow on its shareholders a special one-time dividend of $3 a share, a payout worth $32 billion.&nbsp;   Although other companies have paid special dividends in the past, the size of Microsoft's payout is far and away the largest cash grant in corporate history.    While the figures in these cases always seem insane, put that aside and think about what the Redman boys are telling us.&nbsp; They don’t see&nbsp;MSFT growing faster than the market as a whole.&nbsp; And Microsoft being an industry leader, the industry&nbsp;may not&nbsp;grow faster than the market as a whole.&nbsp; They’ve looked high and low and there’s nothing they can do with all the cash&nbsp;that's&nbsp;coming in the doors, so they’re giving it to the shareholders to go find something better to invest in.   Since I was a kid, computer and software was the shining city on the hill of industry and business.&nbsp; From the space program, to Commodore 64's to&nbsp;laptops to internet porn- this was where the growth and cash was.&nbsp; They were revolutionizing the world.&nbsp; Well, they did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they will be settling down and become just like….an automaker…or a retail stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun, but nothing too&nbsp;exciting.&nbsp; Pumping out regular products upgrades. Changing the accessories and the style, but&nbsp;mostly the same.&nbsp; This transition make take time.&nbsp; 10? 20 years?&nbsp;&nbsp;But the idea of anything exciting coming out of the software industry-  urlLink The Pure Investor &nbsp;just doesn’t see it.   Don’t despair though, something else will shake&nbsp;your world.&nbsp; Just wait.&nbsp; It’s coming at you right now.&nbsp; You don’t even know it.&nbsp; Your 3-year old will take it for granted in her 30’s, but to&nbsp;you it will be a marvel.&nbsp; You’ll look at it just like your great-grandfather would have looked at&nbsp;this  urlLink laptop  - or you would have 15 years ago.&nbsp; Now, sitting in your office, you’re using one to&nbsp;kill time.&nbsp; Get back to work.   Stay you.   P.S.&nbsp; Buy my  urlLink book .

      Wall Street Journal&nbsp; urlLink link  re:&nbsp;Linda Ronstadt.&nbsp; I'm bored already with that. Just to be politically fair though, I try to miss all Charleton Heston movies.&nbsp; I always picture Pharoah saying "no" to&nbsp;"let my people go" and then Chuck pulls out a double barrel and blows him away.&nbsp;   Sorry I missed a day of blogging.&nbsp;  Got to be more disciplined .&nbsp; Eric stopped by to work on the furnace some more.&nbsp; My AC went kaput a few weeks ago and I finally called him up to get a quote, he said he might as well do the furnace while he's here since it was about 30 years old.&nbsp; He didn't want to come back the first cold week in October.&nbsp; Tonight, he was here late, that's ok, but then I got to bed late because I&nbsp;then watched a tivo'd Nip/Tuck(great writing, good looking rich people having sex, great show-watch it without the kids).&nbsp;   A storm moved in early this morning, woke up the kids - get them back to bed,&nbsp;laid down with them,&nbsp;get them to sleep&nbsp;- then sump pump came on from the rain water and wouldn't turn off.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Divine Mrs. M turned that off and waited up for it to need turned off again. I could hear her watching Design on a Dime.&nbsp; Then it started.&nbsp;   Little worries crept into my brain.&nbsp; What if that happens? What if this happens? Where's the money for this coming from?&nbsp; These things ping into my brain in rapid succession and my mind becomes an echo chamber for worries.&nbsp; They speed up and I can't keep track of them.&nbsp; A cacaphony of stress and anxiety.&nbsp;So I lay awake, stare at the ceiling and stew.&nbsp; I can usually stop myself before it spins out of control.&nbsp; Fine! I told myself.&nbsp;I'll get up.&nbsp; Shower.&nbsp; Put on clothes.&nbsp; Hit my sites.&nbsp; Blog this out of my head.   I come from a strong line of worriers and fretters and borderline paranoid personality disorder victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, my worries usually never&nbsp;materialize.&nbsp; The money always seems to come when needed.&nbsp; And if it doesn't, it doesn't seem that bad.&nbsp;   I remember when the market was down, really down, I sat up night after night double over in worry and spent a few nights tossing up dinner.&nbsp; I had very specific fears.&nbsp; Never happened. Energy wasted.   Stay you.

      RE: the Ronstadt/Alladin controversy,  urlLink Drudge  linked to a  urlLink story  and highlighted this paragraph:&nbsp;    It's a real conflict for me when I go to a concert and find out somebody in the audience is a Republican or fundamental Christian. It can cloud my enjoyment. I'd rather not know."&nbsp;    Drudge ran it with the tag  BIGOT .&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what he's getting at.&nbsp; Let's say a Christian Rock group (is there one that doesn't suck?) declares in concert it's uncomfortable with homosexuals or pro-choice people - they'd be hounded until their careers are over.&nbsp; Probably be blamed for try to incite a mob?The reporter put this Ronstadt quote in the story almost as a throw away.&nbsp; Double standards- what are you going to do?  &nbsp;  What bothers me about her dedicating a song to Michael Moore is that it's just&nbsp;not polite.&nbsp; I don't talk politics with people when I don't know where they stand.&nbsp; I just always thought it was rude. So why would she bring&nbsp;it up to a concert hall&nbsp;full of strangers.&nbsp; And why would somebody paying good money to forget their problems in Vegas want to hear about it.&nbsp; It's jerking them back to the real world in an otherworldly environment - that's not what their there for.&nbsp; It's just rude Linda!  &nbsp;  But that's not my point.&nbsp; I don't think that she's being bigoted.&nbsp; I think she's just acting like a close minded teenager without much life experience.&nbsp; Strange to say about an international has-been superstar.&nbsp; Or is it?&nbsp; Speaking from personal experience, I have loathed some people that have the exact same opinions I hold-something about them just drives me nuts.&nbsp; Sitting here, I can think of two -- three --&nbsp;four people.&nbsp; Four people! Four people&nbsp;who have a very similar outlook to me, but I cring whenever I know I'll have to deal with them.&nbsp; Others who I&nbsp;care for&nbsp;deeply dread my politics and I theirs.&nbsp; I don't understand&nbsp;them and sometimes think&nbsp;if I&nbsp;could just say&nbsp;one perfect thing that they might&nbsp;change their minds.&nbsp; But they wouldn't and they'd be pissed at my for trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get along with them just fine and in some cases consider them good friends.&nbsp; I try mostly to follow John Derbyshire's  urlLink advice :&nbsp;    Lefty friends. There are a number of people I am very fond of, who are Left. For reasons I don't completely understand, this troubles me. I suppose it is the tension between liking them as people, and thinking their opinions are silly. Short of converting them to my point of view, or vice versa — neither of which, of course, ever happens — there is no way to resolve this tension in their presence, so I take it to bed with me and it pops out at 3 A.M. like a hernia.   As for Linda, just remember she posed for this  urlLink cover  so have a sense of humor about her. Stay you.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I want to feel good about the church, but then I read things like  urlLink this .&nbsp;   The gist of the story is that genetically modified foods are out there and has been proven to reduce crop disease and increase harvest yields.&nbsp; Great news for the poor of the world?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Those at the Catholic Institute for International Relations believe that it's an attempt by "big seed" to control and victimize the poor.&nbsp; Read Mr. Conko's response for the facts on this particular issue, but it provides another illustration of a topic I addressed in my book.&nbsp;   Some people gave me grief about the section of the  urlLink  Pure Investor   where I'm picking on the church, but again and again those that pose as the advocate for the poor and oppressed want to keep them poor and oppressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But repeatedly the church takes very economically liberal and socialist positions and tries to browbeat their flocks into taking those position.&nbsp; They know better than the actual poor farmers working the land.&nbsp; In my experience, the flocks are tolerant but painfully aware that these positions caused the majority of human suffering in the 20th century.  &nbsp;  I wrote in  The Pure Investor :    "The church says we should strive for equality of man.&nbsp; The fashionable church leadership maligns the U.S. as a greedy, unjust, and oppressive country.&nbsp; The Pure Investor looks at the food the United States ships abroad and the technology selfishly developed by our citizens that saves lives of third world people and makes their impoverished life slightly easier and more tolerable.&nbsp; After looking at this, the Pure Investor must agree with the brilliant Tom Wolfe in his essay "In the Land of the Rococo Marxist" from his book  Hooking Up .&nbsp; He states, "If you must rate a nation at this moment in history, your accursed America is the very micrometer by which all other should be measured."  In the final paragraph of the  urlLink CIIR position paper , we get to the real crux of the matter:&nbsp;    "'Food insecurity cannot be solved by technological fixes. If we are to help poor farmers in developing countries, we need to take a close look at the real causes behind poverty, such as social and economic inequalities. Undoubtedly, technology has an important role to play but it needs to be economically, culturally and environmentally appropriate.'"  Read: tech won't help, but taking from the land of plenty will.&nbsp; Those with their faith in government action will substitute any problem for "Food insecurity" above and the cause will always be redistributive economics.&nbsp; Inequalities don't lead to poverty; lack of property rights, rule of law, and democracy does.  &nbsp; Stay you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

I knew I would be gone so I TIVO'd it.&nbsp; Same for This Gun for Hire tonight at about 4:30 a.m.&nbsp; Life if good. &nbsp; Do I still sound stoned?  Stay you.

      Blessed reprieve:  The grandparents are taking the kids this weekend for a weeklong visit.  The Divine Mrs. M. and I will be able to do kinky things like eat a meal without yelling, "Eat what you've given" 47 times. I thought it might even be nice to go to a movie that's not animated by Pixar. So I went over to read what Roger Ebert thought was good and he had  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate . In this version, the evil of the oppressive, totalitarian, butchering ChiComs has been replaced by a US multi-national corporation. I'm guessing it's a drug company whose products have saved my kids lives a couple of times-greedy bastards.  When the original was made in 1962, China was a definite enemy. In 2004, the U.S. also has some definite enemies and hollywood comes up with....us. A publicly owned, worker employing, firm producing something demanded by consumers. No suicide bombing Islamofacists, no Falon Gong killing Chinese, no food-for-oil bribe taking, reactor selling French...us!  Roger Ebert's column also annoyed me.   There's a level of cynicism here that is scarier than the Red Chinese villains in John Frankenheimer's 1962 classic. It's a stretch to imagine a communist takeover of America, but the idea that corporations may be subverting the democratic process is plausible in the age of Enron.  A communist takeover was a stretch. Oh,  urlLink really ? All that Sovietphile Henry Wallace had between him and the Oval Office was FDRs rice paper of a heart.  I'm also tired of Enron being held up as evidence of some failure of our system. To the contrary, it was a glowing success. They cheated and created no value. They couldn't perpetuate their lie forever. Adam Smith's invisible hand bitch slapped them down. That's what capitalism is about. A brief amount of pain but the problem is corrected.  As for subverting the democratic process, I'm more afraid of the government itself. What happens when you remove capitalist forces? You take the sting of the bitch slap away. You get the social security administration, the farm program, price supports, all the other wastes I wrote about in  urlLink The Pure Investor .

      Here's the Wall Street Journal's take on the Presbyterian's anti-Israel  urlLink vote .&nbsp; Mr. Lefkowitz takes the same take as I do but make some additional points.&nbsp; But still, he&nbsp;leaves unanswered why Israel is suppose to suck so much.&nbsp;  Anyone willing to explain it too me?&nbsp; Please, I'm willing to listen.

      WhenI turned&nbsp;34 this past April I realized I had outlived Jesus, Alexander, and Chris Farley.&nbsp; I beat them, but I felt old.&nbsp; And weak.&nbsp; I'm the father of two daughters and have nightmares of boyfriends I won't be able to intimidate.&nbsp; I need to look in shape and threatening within the next say... 4-7 years.&nbsp;   So I've established some rules for myself:&nbsp; First, I don't eat at any restaurants that have a drive up window.&nbsp; Second, I've given up all sweets.&nbsp; This doesn't sound like much, but I've been known to eat a pounder of M&M's in one sitting - weekly.&nbsp; Third, I eat no potato chips and french fries.&nbsp; I've stuck with eat of these so far.&nbsp; I've failed at getting to bed earlier and a total cessation of caffiene.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp;   I've lost a grand total of zero pounds, but I feel better, stand taller, have more patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I've been exercising.&nbsp; If I keep this up, the tightening of the cold grip of death will&nbsp;be postponed by a few years.&nbsp;   In my book, I wrote 10,000 words or so&nbsp;on what's necessary for a growing economy.&nbsp; I totally missed the effects of  urlLink Hell .&nbsp; The St. Louis fed has given me pause for thougtht.&nbsp;&nbsp;   From the report:   ....there is a tendency for countries in which a larger percentage of the population believes in hell to have lower levels of corruption.....It shows a strong tendency for countries with relatively low levels of corruption to have relatively high levels of per capita GDP.&nbsp;  I don't believe this report. Someone from the St. Louis Fed is having a little fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would leave the stats to The Divine Mrs. M. but from my rudimentary knowledge the sample size seems small and the correlation between belief in Hell and corruption (-.34) doesn't seem all that strong.  Plus this flies in the face of my own professional experience as a financial planner working with middle income people for the past several years.&nbsp; Most people don't&nbsp;take action&nbsp;their retirement until they are pulling the confetti from their hair after their retirement party.&nbsp; I'm sure most people don't think of the afterlife either-at least not specifically.&nbsp; People just don't look that far ahead.&nbsp; There's always time to correct a problem.&nbsp; Sure, this could send me to hell, but I'll make up for it later.  Further, the human capacity for justifing&nbsp;their own wrong actions is&nbsp;infinite.&nbsp; Everyone has an excuse.&nbsp; I'm sure Hitler felt totally ready to meet his maker.&nbsp; Is the fear of Hell going to keep an export clerk from demanding a bribe&nbsp;or a cube person from playing solitaire?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; They can justify it in their own minds.&nbsp; Hell isn't for them and even if something would send them to&nbsp;Hell, they've got time to make up for it. &nbsp;  Stay you.

      I noticed  urlLink this  little tid-bit the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first paragraph of a&nbsp;press release from the Presbyterian church reads:&nbsp;   The 216th General Assembly approved several measures opposing the Israeli occupation of Palestine Friday, including a call for the corporate witness office of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to begin gathering data to support a selective divestment of holdings in multinational corporations doing business in Israel/Palestine.  Later in the release we get this nugget:   The Rev. Victor Makari, the PC(USA)'s liaison to the Middle East, supported the divestment strategy, saying, “I think the issue of divestment is a very sensitive one with Israel. … If nothing else seems to have changed the policy of Israel toward Palestinians, we need to send a clear and strong message.”  First, why would be Presbyterian's pass some useless measure against Israel specifically?&nbsp; Second, why is Israel the bad guy in this fight?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm honestly curious.   It seems fashionable to blame Israel for the bloodshed.&nbsp; Maybe they are at fault (I personally don't see it).&nbsp; But shouldn't the Presbyterians chastise&nbsp;other governments that are far worse.&nbsp; Others that are dictatorial, totalitarian, and oppressive?&nbsp; I&nbsp;entered Cuba into the Presbyterian's&nbsp;search engine&nbsp;and didn't find a call for&nbsp;sanctions,&nbsp;of North Korea, or of&nbsp;pre-war Iraq.&nbsp; In fact, the church calls for engaging these countries.&nbsp; See&nbsp; urlLink here &nbsp;and  urlLink here .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Presbyterian policy is&nbsp;sanctions against a democracy and engagment of mob-states run by maniacal cleptocrats.&nbsp;   Next question:&nbsp;why is Israel the bad guy?&nbsp; I've been reading/skimming a door stop of a  urlLink book  on the subject.&nbsp; From what I can tell, the Brit's left after WWII and said "you guys (Jew and Arabs) work it out" and  BLAM! , everybody (including the Brits) start blasting the Jews - and it hasn't stopped.&nbsp; Yes, the IDF knocks down homes ( where snipers are&nbsp;hiding ).&nbsp; Yes, they've occupied Gaza and the West Bank ( after being repeatedly attacted from these areas ). Yes, they're building an ugly wall/barrier ( that's stopped the killing ).&nbsp; But they're probably tired of being killed.&nbsp; Somebody fill me in on what I'm missing.&nbsp; Please?   I can only&nbsp;see one answer to&nbsp;why&nbsp;the Presbyterian Church&nbsp;wants to sanction Israel and engage&nbsp;dictators and why&nbsp;Israel is seen as the aggressor after repeated being attacked.&nbsp; It's that when the community of nations sits down at the table, the Presbyterians look down the table at Israel and sees the same&nbsp;thing Annie Hall's grandmother saw at the end of the&nbsp; urlLink table .

      This shall be a DNC Convention free zone for the rest of the week.&nbsp; I won't talk about them at all.&nbsp; There are smarter people out there than me, plus I don't particularly like conventions.&nbsp; Mostly this is because of the poor speaking that is done during them.&nbsp; The speeches just suck and, with the exception of Jesse Jackson, they lack any poetry.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a craft at writing or delivery that I think would truly inspire.

      There's no site update this weekend.&nbsp; Guests were in town.&nbsp; House is a mess, spent this evening picking up.&nbsp; This post is unedited.&nbsp; Sorry.  The Challenger of Northern Kentucky printed another one of my letter to the editors  urlLink here .&nbsp; That makes three issues with 2 letters from me.&nbsp; I'm going to see how long I can consecutively get letters in there before I either get ignored or inquired.&nbsp; I'll keep you updated.  God bless  urlLink Lance Armstrong .&nbsp; This man is operating at a different level.&nbsp; It's not physical at all.&nbsp; It's in his head.&nbsp; He's in a place where few people are able to get to.&nbsp; I'm not too religious, but I always picture people like him transcending his experience outside of the realm of the human.  I'm now tired.&nbsp; I'll watch booknotes and head off to sleep.&nbsp; Lot's of work this week so posts may be light, but who knows.&nbsp; Maybe I'll be struck by the muse.  Stay you.

      I will not impune Sen. Kerry's military service no matter how much I think he may be pimping it.  These guys  urlLink here  need to stop.   No one should disparage any man who carries three Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star.  However, after Mr. Kerry came back, he spoke before congress regarding the  urlLink Winter Soldier  investigation conducted in Detroit.  That investigation has been proven to be constructed of total fabrications and lies.  This is where the myth of the crazed, homocidal Viet Nam vet comes from.   My father was a Detroit native.  My father served in Viet Nam.  My father wasn't a baby killer or a rapist.   John Kerry can go to hell.  Stay you.

      Two stories from the Cincinnati Enquirer  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  discuss how proposed school levies have were smacked down across Ohio. From the second story:  Conversations yielded some answers about the mood of voters: It's the economy. Anti-tax advocates were well-organized. It's a vote of no confidence in school leaders. Seniors on fixed incomes can't afford it. Neither can families who are strapped for cash. It's one of the few taxes over which voters have a say.  I don't have much of a dog in this fight. I can see Cincinnati from my back patio in Kentucky. Also, my kids go to private school. My question is what does this mean? I've done  urlLink some  work for political campaigns in the area and it seems like a school levy would be a cinch.  Agitate the votes of a vested minority (teachers, administrators, suppliers, etc) and win big over a dispersed majority who would pay proportionally less.  But that didn't happen.  Is this a signal that Ohioians aren't going to be friendly to anyone hinting at raising taxes?  I think so.  I also think that the Buckeye state will take this attitude into the presidential voting booths come November.  That spells bad news for Kerry in this great big vote rich battleground state.

      Watching coverage of the DNC last week, I learned that Bush is an ultra-conservative and that is bad.  Sorry, Bush is no ultra-conservative. In fact, when reviewing spending, trade policy, and his pet projects like his "faith-based" garbage. He may even be qualified to be called a progressive or liberal. A new  urlLink report  (thanks to Carrie Conko of the Center for getting it to me early) from the Mercatus Center proves it again. There will be 242,500 federal employees regulating us at a projected cost of $39.1 billion (a 5.5% increase).  Ok, it's not all bad. From the report:  After adjusting for inflation, the 2004 Budget is likely to be 5.9 percent less than in 2003. The Regulator's Budget for both 2005 and 2004 represents 1.6 percent of the total outlays estimated in the President's Budget. This is less than in 2003, when the Regulator's Budget was 1.8 percent of the total Budget.  So in real terms, I don't think  urlLink The Pure Investor  would be too unhappy. But that's alot of people telling me how to live, what I can buy, how to serve my clients, what I can eat and smoke etc, etc, etc. It's important to keep in mind what I wrote in my book (have you bought it yet?):  Each of these requirements is another hidden tax that once again raises the Pure Investor's costs and lowers his return....The more regulations that are imposed, the less likely the Pure Investor will risk his capital. Or as the slightly more reputable economist John Stuart Mill wrote:  Every departure from (laissez-faire), unless required by some great good, is a certain evil. Bush is no conservative. In fact, if you really want to make a Republican's head explode argue that Clinton's accomplishments may actually be more conservative. I can argue this point in a later post.

      The WSJ tried to answer a question with  urlLink this  piece that I've been trying to find the answer to for a while.  Mr. Ormsby writes:  One of the more puzzling and, indeed, agonizing aspects of the aftermath of 9/11--especially for those who, like myself, have spent many years teaching and writing about Islam--has been the relative silence of American Muslims, a silence that by and large continues unbroken.  From my  urlLink college  days, I've been taught that as a European I must apologize for colonialism although since I'm of Scottish heritage my people were colonized. I've been taught that as a white male I must apologize and pay reparations for American slavery although my antecedents were no where near the States yet. I been taught that as a US citizen that I must apologize for the Japanese internment camps although I was not born for another 25 years. I've been told about the trail of tears, FDRs refusal to bomb the train lines to Auschwitz, Mei Lay and most recently Abu Graib. I've been told I must apologize for all the tragedies that have occurred that my "kind" may be slightly attached to.  After having been taught all that, why can't I name one Islamic leader that has said, "I'm sorry. This was bad. This does not represent Islam." I've heard Bush say it too many times and I've seen clerics say it here and there. But not so much that I would know any of their names. Can anyone name one mullah that has adamantly gave an unqualified denouncement of Islamofacism and/or the 9/11 attacks? I'm sure the media would love to have an articulate defender of Islam to put on TV at every change. But there nothing. Only silence.  Is it a response the Muslims use because they are afraid to draw attention to themselves either way or is it because in some way they agree with what their more active brothers are doing?

      I thought I was being creative by referring to the wife as The Divine Mrs. M., but I think I just stole it from  urlLink this  guy. Maybe there's not an original thought in my head? Is this how George Harrison felt when he realized he piked the  He's So Fine's  tune for  My Sweet Lord . Oh, well, he got over it.  For a new blog; a new feature: A wine review.  The Divine Mrs. M. (I'm using it anyway) and I are not wine snobs. I do not subscribe to Wine Spectator. The most I read about wine are the little tags stuck to the shelves. If I can find something I like for $4, I'm buying it and serving it to my good friends. We do not buy wine at restaurants because it's hard to enjoy a wine when you know you've been screwed on the price. However, we do make a weekend of the  urlLink Cincinnati Wine festival  each year to try things we haven't before and get a little better education and we do live within walking distance of the riverfront wine oasis known as  urlLink The Party Source . While we have spent mucho dinero on wines in the past, we are now in a phase of finding hidden (cheap) treasures. Currently, this means walking into the Kroger liquor store and rummaging through the discount cart.  That's how for $7 we found  urlLink Obsession . A new grape to me - symphony - which is a cross of Muscat and Grenache. Another white after our long red only jag. We bought it because we had never tried the grape, but also because we like Muscat although not a big fan of grenache. We had it last night about 9 for a late dinner. We both had a large romaine and spinach salad with egg, tomatoes, bacon, and garlicly croutons. My dressing was full of onion flavor and this wine held it's own. First words are key to me: Mine was "sparkly" - not sparkling, but almost. It almost had the taste of a sparkling wine without the tickle that comes with those. Alicia said "bright". It was vibrant, but not sweet. Full mouthed, but light. A good wash down the throat to me and it stayed in the mouth longer than normal but not in a bad way. Very smooth finish. For a pairing, I would use medium flavors on light food, but I don't think it would stand up to anything robust. Nice salads, herbcious chicken would be good. We're going to see if there's any more in the discount bin.

      No pithy thoughts today.  Just relaxation.  With the girls away; the parents shall play.  If you must read something brilliant from me go  urlLink here .  Just another letter to the editor in Northern Kentucky's newest newspaper.  That makes 3 out of 4 editions.  Yesterday was filled with getting the grandparents out of the house, then watching a movie in childless quiet.  Afterward, The Divine Mrs. M. and I dined at  urlLink Indigo's  in Hyde Park then back to Bellevue for Vodka tonics at  urlLink The B-list .  Bellevue being Bellevue (strongly, adamantly German) it was full of big breasted blondes.  Vodka Tonics and Blondes. Perfect!  Today was church with a slight hangover to welcome the new pastor.  Then clothes shopping for me to get rid of some gift certificates I got a Christmas - one pair slacks, two dress shirts, three casual shirts.  The shopping goes much faster without chasing children out of the clothes racks.   Brief car shopping, then back home to watch a movie that  urlLink sucked .  I'm relaxed and ready for work.  Better posts are promised.  Stay you.

      I haven't followed James McGreevey's follies at all and just read this  urlLink blip .  The article quotes McGreevey:  "Shamefully, I engaged in an adult consensual affair with another man, which violates my bonds of matrimony," McGreevey said, without mentioning the lawsuit. "[It was] wrong, foolish and inexcusable. I ask the forgiveness of my wife. She has been extraordinary throughout the ordeal, blessed by virtue of love and strength." "Let me be clear: I accept total and full responsibility for my actions. However, I am required to do now what is right, to correct the consequences of my actions, and to be truthful to my loved ones, friends, family and myself."   Why after reading this do I like the guy after having an affair and playing slap and tickle with homeland security? Oh right, someone's is actually exercising  urlLink personal responsibility . He's protecting his state and family from his actions by sacrificing his own position and ambitions. This guy must not have learned the lessons of Bill Clinton.

      Pete DuPont had a nice  urlLink piece  yesterday on who makes a better President - an executive or a legislator?  One thing I have noticed during this election cycle is the absense of a celebrity CEO being offered up as president. The reason is easy: corporate scandals and the market being down. CEOs are out of fashion. There has been no-one that has captured and/or inspired the country. The CEO as savior has been a pretty regular occurence in the past 25 years. Lee Iacocca, Ross Perot, Jack Welch and Donald Trump, have all been seriously discussed. I hear the ego of  urlLink Marc Cuban  swelling up to join this club also - give it 15 years.  In my  urlLink book , I write that CEOs are a group that shouldn't be listened to on how to grow the economy. I've always argued to CEOs would make lousy Presidents.  Reason #1 being that they don't know how government functions. Bureaucracy is a different animal than a corporation. The corporation has strong lines connecting the CEO on down to the janitor. If the CEO pulls one of those lines the Janitor jumps. If not, the CEO can come in and knock some heads. Not so with government. The President may have direct control of the White House, but beyond that, he must rely on suasion and the power of his person to control the many fiefdoms in a bureucracy. How often has the State Department worked against and undermined a President? The military?  More often than we would want to know.  Reason #2 is the mental attitude of a CEO. By definition, they have to tell their workers what to do to get success from them. You can't tell Americans what to do. They're going to do what they want. In fact, they'll do exactly opposite of what you tell them just to show you. A CEO's first instinct is to control: Iacocca proposed higher taxes, restricted trade, required "public service." While specific policies may sound attractive, in a free country, command and control does fly.  Reason #3: History. Who have been our presidents with business backgrounds? Hoover, Carter, and, now, Bush. No further comment required on the first two. As for Bush, I'll reserve judgement until Hillary is president, but the fact that he's the first  urlLink MBA President  never made me comfortable.

      IV's been giving me grief on this  urlLink thread  regarding drug companies pimping their products in glossy magazines to an ignorant public who will gobble down any pill that will give them an erection.  Philosophically, I don't like large corporations, but recognize them as a necessary element and their accrual to much power seems to be self correcting.  That is, unless they team up with the Feds to protect each other.  But what I think IV is getting at is the discussion of personal responsibility.  A topic I find totally boring, but in this discussion worth an exploration.   Where does a person's responsiblity for their own behavior and consumption end and where must government step in to protect people from being influenced by corporations or even the culture?   Some hypotheticals:  Should restrictions be placed on drug ads as IV argues? Should people not be allowed to buy into the equities markets at certain times? People where throwing money at tech funds in the winter of 2000, should money magazine be liable for putting 5 stars on the funds in January of 2000 that got clobbered over the next couple of years.   Let's get away from the corporate world:  Should the government be waging a  War on Drugs  to save people from willing getting high? Should an unwed mother with too many kids and no self support be sterilized?   I can't think of any more examples now, but can and will.  My problem with saying yes to the above is that all that's being done is taking power away from individuals and, yes, corporations and putting that power into the hands of government.  At times, I sound anti-government or anti-corporations, but I'm just anti-concentration of power.  Ok, I've got to get to work.  I'm speaking today to this  urlLink group .  Let's hope somebody shows up.

      The first comment posted to this fine new blog is by my friend IV (pronounced Fore! like the Huey Lewis  urlLink album ). Thanks IV! You can read what he has to say  urlLink here . IV has always been one of my favorite people and I'm glad we're back in touch.  I hope he continues to post and keep me on my toes. He has a diverse educational background which I hope he'll tell us about and isn't afraid to irritate me (in fact, I'm sure he would enjoy it.)  He grew up on the mean streets of Fort Wayne near the intersection of Monarch Drive and Maplecrest Avenue.  That was a tough neighborhood. He lives in Chicago now and works for a firm that is a CIA front "consulting" firm that specializes in either using technology to disrupt the plans of America's enemies  (the French)  or bioweapons designed to eliminate third world poverty  (they ain't poor if they're dead) . I'm not sure which.  Now for the topic of the day: Trade Restrictions, Tax Two from  urlLink The Pure Investor   What brings this up? The announcement found  urlLink here  from Reuters that they are shipping some editorial jobs to India. I dislike Reuters for their inability to call  urlLink "terrorist"  terrorist.  Also, another friend of mine (unidentified until he posts a comment) who lives in Seattle wishes to get into trade with that fine country. This friend has recently spent much time in India and has brought in a priceless import. Finally, John Kerry has been going around calling the head of companies who outsource jobs to India "Benedict Arnold CEOs." Let me get this straight: He wants to internationalize the war, but be xenophobic towards trade.  So they're good enough to go die with/for us to make the war cheaper, but not good enough to trade with.  Anyone who has read my book (not many of you) knows I'm not a fan of many CEOs.   But their stated sole job is to get the cheapest labor possible to provide higher returns to their shareholders. That's it. It's all about the benjamins, baby!  Two reasons I'm not afraid of outsoucing: First, in the short-term the loss of jobs helps the US economy sort out efficiencies in our systems. This discussion bores me. Second, in the long-term, the problem will take care of itself. This is done by the monetary exchange system.  From my book on why we need not have been afraid of Japan during the 80's.  The Pure Investor doesn’t worry that other countries are not buying American goods. If they wish to continue to trade with the U.S., they will be forced to open up their system. Monetary exchange is the pry bar that does it. When Toyota builds cars in Japan and sells them in the U.S., the Pure Investor knows that they are paid with U.S. dollars. The Pure Investor knows that the Japanese company must convert the dollars they were paid into Japanese yen to get them back Japan. But, like any commodity, as they sell dollars and buy yen, the price of the yen will rise and, conversely, the price of the dollar will fall. If the yen continues to rise, it will take more dollars to buy a yen and Japanese products will become progressively more expensive to Americans. The American goods will become cheaper relative to Japanese goods until no one is willing to buy anything made in Japan over something made in the U.S.  Taken a little bit further, the Pure Investor contemplates what else can Japanese manufacturers do with the U.S. dollars they earned from selling to Americans other than converting them to Yen and taking them back to Japan. First, they can buy U.S. goods. While this hasn’t happened to the extent that American business and government would like, the Japanese people are hurt more than U.S. citizens are. Their government has imposed on them a limited number of goods that they can purchase. Japanese freedom has been limited. The second thing the Japanese can do with their dollar is to invest in U.S. securities. If they do this, they obviously value U.S. businesses and believe it has a good future and will offer a good return. When this happens, U.S. companies use the Japanese money to expand their own businesses that increase U.S. employment and stock prices. The third thing that the Japanese can do with their U.S. dollars is to build factories in the U.S. to build their goods. They have already done this to a large extent. This has increased U.S. employment and tax revenue. Toyota has a factory in Georgetown, Kentucky; Mercedes Benz opened a plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Nissan’s facility is in Smyrna, Tennessee; and BMW manufacturers the ultimate driving machine in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. Across the United States, communities once solely dependent on agriculture have diversified their economic bases with foreign industry. The final option the Japanese have is to trade their dollars for the currency of another country with someone who wants U.S. dollars. The effect of this is the same as listed above; the U.S. benefits.

      Don't think I can link my book  urlLink The Pure Investor  to my watching too much television. Think again. Friday at 10:00 p.m. The Divine Mrs. M. likes to watch  urlLink Monk  on USA. From the official site:   urlLink Adrian Monk  ( Tony Shalhoub ) was once a rising star with the San Francisco Police Department, legendary for using unconventional means to solve the department's most baffling cases. But after the tragic (and still unsolved) murder of his wife, the devastated Monk became obsessive-compulsive. His psychological disorder has caused him to develop an abnormal fear of virtually everything: germs, heights, crowds... even milk. His condition eventually cost him his job, and continues to pose unique challenges in his daily life.   This translates into having a cute 20-minute mystery so Mr. Monk gets to act strangly for 40-minutes (i.e. he demands wipes after shaking hands, he cleans up crime scenes during the investigation, etc.)  I find the show innocuous and charming, but a thought crossed my mind this Friday past. Does society consider mental disorders disabilities? If so, isn't laughing at Mr. Monk fixing the knit on a murder's sweater cruel? Isn't laughing at him having a panic attack in a locked panic room mean? If, instead, Mr. Monk hadn't the use of his legs would it be funny watching him trying to go up a too steep ramp or getting his his wheels caught on a curb and falling into the street? I think not and I'm sure there is a site protesting this somewhere.  urlLink Here's  one article (the writer is an editor for a new journal of literature and disability culture; there's a job for everyone). I'm shocked I didn't find more quickly, but that dovetails into my next point.  The American's with Disabilities Act was passed 14 years ago and in effect said that we need to accomodate all those with disabilities - physical as well as mental. The ADA was one of the most expensive regulations imposed on the country and the costs are still being calculated.  One of the wonders of human nature is that you can't legistlate the human brain. Just because you pass a voting rights act doesn't mean racism is ended. And just because you pass the ADA doesn't mean some poor man dealing with Obessive Compulsive Disorder isn't just plain funny while a cripple falling down a flight of stairs isn't.  In my book, I deal with the costs regulations impose on the market. I call them the fourth tax. Each additional regulation is an eroding of market returns. At times, regulations also give us a glimpse into ourselves. Does society think that extending protections to those with mental disorders is as valuable as extending them to physical handicaps? I think Monk's high ratings answers "no."

      Nothing pisses me off more than companies acting stupidly.  I want to be a big corporation some day and I hope that I present myself more intelligently that CSX does in  urlLink this  article.  That's why I wrote  urlLink this  letter to the editor.  Stay you.

      The Tax Foundation has a nice study out today.  It's  urlLink here .  Conclusion is that the top 20% of income earners keep paying more and more.  Why does this make me nervous?  Because the guy who I work for is one of them.  I'm with him when he makes his quarterly tax payment.  The numbers are quite a bit larger than mine.  Any way, if trends continue and he keeps paying a larger and larger portion, at some point, he'll have to make up for it out of my salary and/or benefits.  This is not good!  I'm just joking -  a little .  It's been said before by somebody, but if you tax something, you get less of it.  If you tax incomes (work), you get less work.  If you tax investment, you get less of it.  At what point does a guy whose making a nice income say that it's just not worth it to go to work anymore.   For some reason Dennis Hastert turns me off.   Can't someone get him a treadmill, decent haircut and contacts?   But if he is pushing forward  urlLink the sales tax idea , I might have to write him a check.  Stay you.

      In response to  urlLink this  article in the Sunday Challenger, I submitted  urlLink this  letter to the editor. Maybe I sound a bit angry, but I don't have alot of compassion with prisoners. Really? How hard is it to stay out of jail? Besides a ticket and social situations, I haven't spoken to a cop for any longer than 5 minutes in my life.  I'm weakly against the death penalty. What does weakly mean? I think it's a bad idea to give the state that much power over a citizen, but I'm not going to be one of these people who stays out in the cold night of an execution saying prayers and weeping when the lights flicker.  But I wouldn't abolish the death penalty and keep the situation the same as now.  I would like to have a cage you put these murders in and give them 3 squares and a Bible or Judy Bloom to read and forget about them - no release, no parole, no compassion.
