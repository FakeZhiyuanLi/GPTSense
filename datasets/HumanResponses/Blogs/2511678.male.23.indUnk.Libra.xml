      I've turned down the jobs from both gyms that gave me offers.  I got my personal training certification because I was interested in living a fit, healthy lifestyle and helping others do the same.  Not to sell supplements and overpriced training packages.  No thank you 24Hour and Ballys Fitness.  You guys are nothing more than pushy, sleazy salesmen.  I couldn't do that job and keep a good conscious.    I have no idea what I'm going to do now for a job, but I'm not terribly concerned about it.  Something will come up, and I've got enough savings to take some time off to get myself together.

      I could say lot about today, but I'm so sunburned that it's hurts to even type.  So I'm going to keep this short.    Today was my first experience with Venice Beach, and I have to say I'm a little dissappointed in myself for not going there sooner.  After all, I've been in Orange County for over a year.  Oh, well... that's neither here nor there, right?  So my girlfriend showed me the ropes of the famous strip.  And you know what?  Venice is a really great little town.     urlLink    Venice Beach  The beach is nice, and there are tons of shops and booths and folks peddling any trash they can find under the pretense of art.  It's brilliant.  There's some good art there, too.  Not a lot, but some.  Look long enough and you'll find some gems.  The other great part about Venice is that it's filled with crazies.  And if there's one thing I can't get enough of, it's crazies.  There everywhere.  There was a guy with no legs who was just standing on his head.  Plenty of dudes in speedos dancing around.  We even saw a one man band.  And who can forget Muscle Beach?  Yep, saw that too.  But it was a bit of a let-down because I didn't see any roid-head bodybuilders working out.  Maybe next time.   urlLink    Crazy man with no legs  Overall, the vibe in Venice is a really nice one.  You get the sense that everybody there is just happy to be there, and they're all having fun.  The place is pretty clean, too.  For some reason I expected it to be a little dirtier than it was.  Even the water looked alright, and I didn't notice any trash on the sand.  My girlfriend said the water looked better than normal, though.    We were there for a good five hours, and I forgot to wear sunscreen, so now I feel like a baked potatoe.  And I look like some weird lobster-man.  I hope I don't get skin cancer.

      I had my final interview at the gym in Hollywood yesterday for the personal training position.  It went well enough, but I'd be fine with not being hired, I think.  The job is so much more of a sales job than it is a training job, and like I said, I don't really care for that sort of thing too much.  Also, I wouldn't mind taking about a month off after my last day at my current job, just to kind of get things together and get settled with moving into a new place and all.  But we'll see.  The guy at the gym said they would be calling in the next few days, so I guess I'll just wait and see what they have to say.  If they offer the job, I'll take it because, heck, it's a job.  And if it sucks, and I can always quit - so I really have nothing to lose.  It looks like we're not taking the play I was doing a while back to the Hudson, even though they invited us.  I think it's a mistake on the theatre's part, because it's great exposure that they're just pissing down the toilet, but hey, it's not my theatre.  They can do what they want.  There's a lot of reasons why, but trust me when I say that most of them are terrible excuses.  I don't want to get into it.  My writing is going pretty slow right now.  I think because of all the stress I have with moving and finding a new job and whatnot.  I haven't even started to look for a new place yet.  I've been writing about a page a day, but even that's slowed to nil in the past couple of days.  I even got my new powerbook so I can take it anywhere and write (because I hate writing at home), but all the downtime I have I just want to spend relaxing and hanging out.  Not working.  I gotta get myself out of that habit.  Writing is like a muscle.  The less you use it, the weaker it gets.  The more you use it, the stronger it gets.  It's easy to say that, but I'm still not doing it.  Sometimes I think I'm really lazy.

      My apologies if you visited the site while it was in a state of flux today.  I gave it a bit of a face lift.  This is LA after all.  Just be glad I didn't give it a boob job.

      I’ve spent the better part of last Friday and this morning (along with various times throughout the weekend) making my first movie.  Well, I wouldn’t really call it a movie, per se, it’s more of the opening montage to a show entitled “The Incredible Adventures of Compy the Corporate Computer.”  I made it with photos I took with my digital camera at work.  I have this little soft foam computer toy that has arms and legs.     urlLink    Oh, Compy - what hullaballoo have you gotten yourself into this time?  I thought it would be funny to make a slide show with him in all kinds of crazy shenanigans.  And so the character of Compy was born, and I think I’m going to do more.  I want to do a show with stills and voice over the characters and do a whole story.    I edited the little movie on my new  urlLink Powerbook , which is more awesome than a Japanese leaping turtle.  I even wrote the music on it with  urlLink Garageband , which is more fun than a Siberian whooping crab.  Now that I’ve given my two weeks notice at my current job, this is a great way to pass the time.

      Remember the Dell kid?  You know, the one that always said, “Dude, you’re getting a Dell” in a ton of commercials?  Well, I don’t know how many of you listen to Stern in the morning, but this kid was on his show today.  Howard was asking about his contract with Dell, and what happened to it.  Basically, this is it:  The audition was his second audition ever, and he landed the Dell commercial (which was also their first national campaign).  The commercial was a big success, so they did more.  Eventually, Dell offered this kid a half million dollar contract to do about 4 more commercials and some guest appearances.  But then he screwed it all up by getting busted for buying pot.  Dell pulled the plug on the ½ mill deal, and dropped the kid from the campaign.  He lost $500,000 because he bought $50 worth of drugs.     urlLink     He talks positive about it, like it was actually a good thing, but I'm not so sure.  He wanted that cash, and he deserved it.  He was the Dell Guy, and everyone in the country knows him as that.  Now he walks around with the brand, but nothing to show for it.  He wants to try and make it as a real actor now (not commercial actor), but personally I don’t think it’ll ever fly.  He’s the Dell kid.  It’s hard to see him as anything else.    That’s the problem (one of the few) with the huge commercial campaigns.  If you’re lucky enough to get one, you’d better get used to being known as that for the rest of your career.  Doing too well at selling one thing can really pigeon hole you in this town.  If that’s the road you take, don’t screw it up before the big payout.  That half million could have set him for life.  If you’re about to sign a big contract, stay away from anything remotely illegal until the ink is dry.  Now I wonder whatever happened to those kids playing Dell Interns in the follow-up campaign...

      If you decide that you want to make a living in "the industry," chances are you're going to have to work another job at the same time you pursue your artistic goals and career.  Because lets be honest - it ain't easy.  And trying to find that perfect substitute job can be difficult.  You have to wiegh a number of things - how much commitment will the job require?  How much will it pay?  Can I live off of that?  Will it give me enough free time and flexibility to pursue what I really want to do?  These are all questions you have to ask yourself before taking any job.  Sure, you need a job that is going to support you - that will give you enough money to pay rent, car payments, food, etc.  Also, it's nice to have one that will give you health insurance.  On the other hand, the more money a job pays, the more likely it is that that job will require a strong commitment, and thus the less likely a employer will be excited about hiring an actor.  Because an actor may have to take off at a moments notice (for auditions), and employers don't usually like that sort of thing.  So if you're looking to get hired, try not to mention that you're an actor unless they ask.  Don't ask, don't tell.    The best thing to do is to find a job that you don't particularly mind doing, that pays just enough to keep you alive (but not enough to make you too comfortable!) and gives you enough flexibility with scheduling to keep any important auditions/meetings that might come up at a moments notice.  Of course, if you find a job that you really enjoy that pays you great, then by all means, forget about the industry and do that.  I'd heard that personal training is a great thing to do, but the more I talk to the guys that are doing the hiring, the more I get the impression they really want people that are not part of the industry.  They want to keep their turnover rate as low as possible.  Makes sense, and I guess every employer is going to have that preference, but hey, this is Los Angeles.  Everybody (almost) is or wants to be part of the industry.  And as long as they don't ask directly, I won't tell them I'd leave the moment a better opportunity came.  post script:  I've got a 3rd interview for the gym in Hollywood on the 23rd - to meet the district manager.  I'm still debating on whether I'm going to go or not because I'm not getting the best of all feelings from this place, either.  The job basically amounts to me becoming the equivalent of a car salesman more so than a trainer, and I'm not very interested in that sort of thing.

      I really don't think I need to explain any further, but for those of you that have never lived in Orange County - I will.  I've been here for the past year and a half, generally working and spending my spare time at one of the local small theatres.  What I've come to realize from the people around and the audiences we have is this:  Orange County is completely devoid of energy.  This place lacks enthusiasm, originality, eccentricities, creativity, and heart.     urlLink    Not a stimulating environment  I hear this same complaint all the time about Los Angeles.  I hear people talk about how fake and plastic it is (not to mention the people there).  How everyone is so focused on 'the look' and the 'L.A. lifstyle.'  Sure, there's plenty of that in LA, but there's also a ton of culture and quirks and creativity.  And LA can even (*gasp*) inspire!  Yes, it can - hell, it's whole city built on dreams and delusions, love and heartache, guts and fear, brutal truth, outrageous lies, false hope, fairy tales, the filthy rich and the desperate poor.  Orange County was built on guilded plywood.  Which leaves much to be desired.  I feel like my creativity level after being here is nearly depleted.  I don't have that same sense of excitement and energy about creating whatever I could dream up that I used to have.  You sit in a place that puts all stresses on how much money/gadgets you can acquire, and it eventually gets to you.  Orange County is the corporate capitol of the country, and that culture bleeds down into the population until we all become our own profit hungry CEO's.

      The guy from the nicer gym in Hollywood called me back, and I went to an interview on Thursday.  It went great - I aced it.  But I'm still not 100 percent sure I'm going to be hired.  I have a second interview on Monday at 5.  So I don't want to act too smug yet.  But this is a good sign:  Somehow during the interview I mentioned that I had worked at a theatre in Wisconsin right out of college for a while.  The manager of the club asked me which one.  I said " urlLink American Player's Theatre ."  He said he had a friend of his work there and asked me if I knew him.  Of course I did, I know him well and still talk to him every so often - and that was his best friend in college.  Well, things just got smoother after that.  Small world, huh?  Don't burn your bridges, you never know when they might come in handy.

      I’m feeling a little guilty because I haven’t emailed this producer back with a revised treatment for the short urban film (never mind the fact that I’m as white as they come).  I’m kind of over the whole thing, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that this girl has no idea what she’s doing.  I should have known from the beginning.  My first clue was that she wants to direct a short film, knows what she wants the story to be, but doesn’t know how to write it (or doesn’t want to).  The big red flag, though, was that she wanted it to be 25 minutes long.  If you want to make a film and have somebody pay reasonable attention to it, here are your options:  Make a full length feature, or make a short NO MORE THAN 15 MINUTES LONG!!  And even that is pushing it.  There isn’t a market for mid-length films.  Check out all the major festivals, even the mid-line festivals.  Keep the shorts short, that’s your best bet.  So, yeah, all of that stuff plus the fact I think the story she wants me to write is stupid and cliché, and she’s trying to cram too much into even 25 minutes.  I think I’m just gonna say screw it and quit.  I’ve got other more important things to worry about right now, and I don't really feel all that guilty.  Actually, I don't feel guilty at all.

      I bought a  urlLink 12" Powerbook  last night off the  urlLink Apple Online store .  I just can't write at home.  In my bedroom I have an HP desktop sitting under an old card table I got from Target.  The chair I sit in is a fold-out camper chair.  It's too low and uncomfortable.  But it does have a cup holder, so that's a nice thing about it.  But I have a tough time making myself work in my bedroom.  My bedroom is for, well, bed.  It's not a workroom or a writeroom.  So I've been wanting a laptop I can take around with me work wherever/whenever I want.  Yesterday I finally bought one.  I've been looking at the powerbooks for a couple of weeks now, and I've gone back and forth between getting the top 15" model, the top iBook model, or the bottom 12" model.  I opted for the 12" for a couple of main reasons:  I can afford more RAM if I save the 1500 by not getting the 15".  And, as they say, you can never have enough RAM.  Now I can afford to bump it up to 1.25 gigs worth - which is the max for the 12".  Also, I wanted something that was ultra-portable with a longer battery life.  While the 12" doesn't have as long a battery life as the iBook (5 hours compared to 6 - max), it is over a pound lighter.  The 15" is just a little too large to be what I consider ultra-portable.  And the 12" is still more than powerful enough to do any photoshop or video editing I want to do, especially with the extra RAM I can afford to shove in there.  The only things I'm really cutting myself off from by not getting the 15" are Firewire 800 (I still get 400) and Gigabit Ethernet.  Both of those I think I can live without.

      The guy from the bar never called me back, so I didn't get that job.  I'm not terribly dissapointed, though - I felt pretty sketchy about the whole deal.  The bar, the owner, the interview; all a little sketchy.  I did get hired at the gym in Glendale, though.  The manager was great - nice guy.  My only problem is it's a small club (fewer people = fewer clients = less money) and it's in Glendale.  However, yesterday, while I was at the dentist, I got a message from a nicer gym in Hollywood, which I think would pay me more and I'd find more clients.  I called back, but the guy wasn't there anymore.  Hopefully I'll hear from him today, or I'll try calling back again.  I'd rather take that job.

      So, after putting my in my resume and filling out applications at dozens of places, I have two interviews (as of now) to show for it.  One is to be a bartender at a pool hall in Burbank.  I went to that interview this morning.  I think it went well enough, but I can never tell about these things.  The owner had 2 other people to interview later, so he said he would call me tomorrow.  I have another interview Tuesday to be personal trainer at a gym in Glendale.  I'm already certified (through  urlLink ACE ) so that should go all right - but I'll try not to count my eggs before they hatch.  In other news - the show that I've been performing in at a theatre in Orange County has been invited to do a five week run at the  urlLink Hudson Theatre  on Santa Monica in Hollywood.  I don't know for sure if it's going to happen or not, but everybody is pretty gung-ho about it at the theatre, so hopefully it will.  It'll be good exposure at a time when I'm just getting settled in LA.  It's a great compliment in the least.

      I'm up in LA this week starting on my new life.  I've been staying with my buddy Joseph, sleeping in his living room on an air mattress.  It's surprising comfortable.  Well, maybe not the first night, but I think I'm getting used to it.  The purpose of this week is to find a new job (preferrably bartending) so that I can quit my day job in the office in Orange County and move permanently up here.  But it's proving to be a daunting process.  If I don't find a job soon up here in Los Angeles, it won't be because I didn't try.  For the past couple of days I've put in resumes at several bars and restaurants, and while I've gotten a couple of encouraging responses (and I'm being optimistic on that one), for the most part I just hear "No, we're not hiring at the moment" "We're full on staff" "We promote bartenders from within" etc, etc, etc.  But it's ok - I've got two months before my lease runs out and I'm leaving Orange County no matter what, so I can keep looking and there's always a chance that a spot might open up in one of these places I've applied within those two months.  I've also got to go by and pick up my CD of headshots that my photographer is giving me.  She's giving me all the shots on CD for 10 bucks, and I can do all the retouching and formatting myself with photoshop.  Beats paying the lab to do it at 49 dollars per shot.  It pays to be computer savvy.  I'll do that tomorrow morning.  I gave Joseph a couple of the short screenplays I've written over the past few weeks.  He's pretty excited about making them.  We'll get started on those right away as soon as I get up here permanently.  In the meantime, I need to keep writing.    I'm also supposed to be doing a short urban script for a small low-budget production company up here in LA.  Basically, they told me to write a story about "a prank that goes wrong and somebody gets killed.  Oh, and there has to be some outragious reason for the killing."  No lie - those were my instructions.  And she wants it to be a murder/mystery.  25 minutes.  I sent a treatment, and she wants something a little different, so it's back to the drawing board on that.

      I went to a free screening of this movie a couple of nights ago at some theatre on Sunset in Hollywood.  Apparently these things happen every once in a while when  Backstage West  throws a big free screening and invites anyone who wants to come.  But the great part is, they always have someone[s] involved in the movie to come out for an interview and talkback with the audience about the project/process/whatever.    Before I go any further, I must tell you that  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is one of the most incredibly creative movies ever made.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  If you haven't, then slap yourself on the wrist right now and say "Bad.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."    The movie I had already seen, but it was just as good the second time around.  The real treat of the night were the people that came out to talk afterward.  It was none other than Jim Carrey, Steve Golin (producer), and Charlie Kaufman (writer - also did  Adaptation  and  Being John Malkovich ).  Well, pin a rose on my nose for having the coolest night of anyone around.    In a few words:  Steve Golin didn't say much, but most people were interested in Jim or Charlie.  Charlie Kaufman is short, scrauny with bushy hair, and a bit timid.  He didn't talk a lot and kept his answers pretty brief, but he did tell a few interesting stories about his life before he became a successful writer.  It took him 12 years to get a writing job after college.  I was pleasantly surprised at how cool Jim Carrey was - I expected him to be a bit more off the wall.  But instead he comes across as someone who really and truly loves their life and what they do for living.  He is funny, he likes to talk, and he likes to make people life.  But he doesn't do the crazy physical humor all the time.  He's actually pretty quick-witted and told some funny stories.    The whole night was more or less inspirational.

      Jesus, was Sunday my last post?!  All right, I know this is getting ridiculous, and you all expect near daily updates from me.  And you have a right to.  But lately things have been getting a little busy (not to mention I don't sit in front of a computer all day like I used to).  And it's only going to get worse before it gets better.  All next week will be spent moving and my internet connection is going to be shut off for a bit.  I'm not sure when I'll have time to post, but when I do, I will.  I promise.  Just don't give up on me.  Yet.

      As I mentioned earlier, over the past week or two I've been hiring myself out as general handyman help to earn some extra cash while I'm still somewhat between Orange County and Los Angeles.  I got hired for what was originally going to be a 3-day gig at a guy's place down in Laguna (which is in Orange County - I still have my apartment down there, so I took the job).    I guess this guy really liked me because the job turned from being 3 days to being as long as I wanted to work for him.  So I guess I'll stick around until my lease is up on my old place (Aug 7).  Part of the reason I decided to stick around for a week or two is because the guy I work for is absolutely fascinating.    He's gay, almost fifty years old, and lives with his partner of 22 years.  He's a little flamboyant, but nothing obnoxious or annoying.  Let's just say you wouldn't have to have the strongest gay-dar to realize he isn't straight.  But the kicker that makes him interesting is his story:  He's HIV positive (has been for 16 years) and up until about a month ago he was addicted to crystal meth.  Yeah, this guy has been through some shit.    So he likes to tell me stories of his life and what he's been through, seen, done, and what he wants for himself now.  And he opens up freely to me a lot more readily than sometimes I think I'm prepared for.  But it's all so interesting.  Sometimes he gets pretty emotional, though, about the things he tells me, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.  I mean, hey, I'm just a handyman, not a psychiatrist.  So I just stand there and feel awkward holding a dripping paintbrush and listening to him tell me his war stories from the depths of the gay drug scene.    It's all a little surreal.  Sometimes I wonder how I stumble into these situations.

      I was really excited to see this movie. It's not that I thought it would be something brilliant or breathtaking, but all I wanted was another thrill ride like Independence Day. I'm a fan of Will Smith in sci-fi/action movies and I just wanted fun. What I got, though, was a giant load of rehashed commercial poo.    From the moment the movie began, I knew exactly what was going to happen and when. I already knew all the characters because there was nothing new or fresh or even interesting about any of them. This was just your standard cookie-cutter formula flick, and I'll be damned if I'm not getting tired of it. And lets not get started on the ridiculous product placement. I felt like I was watching a big-budget commercial for Converse shoes and Audi cars.     The dialogue was atrocious. Will Smith's one-liners were groaners, there were no funny jokes or even sincere moments. This movie sucked. And the worst part about it is it's attached to Asimov's  I, Robot  series of short stories, which are actually so creative and interesting that they're mind-blowing. And they always will be. This movie should not have been allowed to carry that name.     urlLink     Even they can't believe how bad this movie is.    I'm getting so sick of the Hollywood formula for their big-budget movies. And Hollywood is sticking to the formula more and more closely every year it seems. I think it stems from the major studios trying to attract as many people from all demographics as possible all over the world. They're afraid to take chances or be a little controversial or try something different because it might detract from some of the box-office moolah that they're counting on. Problem is, people are going to get sick of this rehashed crap soon and stop going to see it (well, probably not, actually - but I wish they would). The only way to really stay on top of the game is too keep changing constantly. Try new things, set new standards. Be unpredictable, bold, open to fresh ideas. This way you can rest assured you'll always be interesting.     I, Robot  could have been these things. But it took the easy way, and is just a bunch of boring actors going through the motions on a cartoon set for a movie that's barely watchable.    Don't waste your time.

      Good Lord, I haven't written in forever - and for that, I apologize. Now the big question is "Where to begin?"  There's been so much going on, that I'm not sure what to tell you about  first, because I'm certain you're dying to know.   We'll start with the basics:   I've been staying at my friend Joseph's apartment in Burbank all week and generally hanging out there. It's been a relatively busy week because I've been working again. Yes, that's right - I'm back in the workforce. But not as a happy little worker bee at a slave-driving corporation like before, oh no. I've been hiring myself out as a general handyman - fixing things for people, installing this, hanging that, building those things, and moving that stuff.  And suprisingly, there's a lot of demand for it, and I've been making some really good cash (almost better than when I worked my office job). Finally all those years of working on farms and general odd  jobs and as an electrician has paid off and allowed me to work for myself. It's been grand. The best part is I can work as little or as much as I want, take off any day I want, and generally be  my own boss.  I love it.  And I've met a bunch of really cool people so far.   So there's that.  I've also been seeing the sights around LA a bit.  I went to the  urlLink Getty Museum  yesterday and had a look around.  I don't really feel the need to talk about it because we all know that it's one of the best art museums in the world, and I think that that pretty much sums up my experience.     urlLink     The Getty Entrance   Mostly the week was spent being with friends, talking about future possibilities (however remote they might be), and basically enjoying life. That's what I was thinking about on the way home today. I finally feel like I'm enjoying life out here, and I love LA. The people, the sites, the culture, the bizarreness of it all - I love it.   Last thing: I saw the movie Napolean Dynamite yesterday, and it was well worth the price of admission. It's funny and good and interesting with great characters and really good acting. Joseph  saw Anchorman the night before, and apparently it's the worst stinking  pile of poo Will Ferrell has ever pulled out of his ass. Which one will you see? Decide carefully before you go to the theatre.   Oh - I got my car back today as well. So that's all very nice, thanks for asking. And I promise I won't go so long without posting again. Sorry.

      I've had this urge recently to get out of SoCal for a bit.  Just a few weeks or so.  I just need to get away to refresh myself, and I've had a hankering to travel.  The last BIG trip I made was a few years ago when I packed up and went to live in England for a while.  It was tough at times, but overall a spectacular experience.  I've had the urge to do something like that again.  But I don't want to be gone for as long as I was (several months) and I don't really want to fly overseas.  So I'm thinking about taking a road trip...  through Mexico.  I could drive down the Pacific coast, staying at cheap little hotels, hanging out on the beach, checking out all the Aztec and Mayan ruins struggling with my bad Spanish, and buying cheap folk art.  I've looked into it quite a bit, and it seems I could get by with no problem for about 20 bucks a day.  It would be nice to have no itenerary, and just get in my car and go.  As a matter of fact, I think I will.  I leave August 7.

      Sometimes you reach a point where you're really not sure if you're going to make it or not.  You're not sure if you have what it takes to be what you always thought you could.  Those are the days that I buy a lottery ticket.  Just one.  When you get to the point where you think the best odds you have in life is to win the lottery, well... buy a ticket and pray.  Cause maybe those are your best odds.

      Before I start this post, I'll give you a quick update on the accident issue - the insurance agencies are conducting thier "investigations" and so far there has been no determination as to whom is at fault.  I'm of the opinion that they will probably rule both parties at fault, making each responsible for the repairs to his own car.  That's not so great for me because I only had liability for my car.  Yeah, stupid, I know.  Don't worry - it's full coverage from now on.  But I talked to the body shop, and it looks like the repairs are affordable if I have to pay for them.  So the worst that happens here is I lose a bit of money.  BFD, right?  On to the post!  Last weekend I had a friend of mine from Alabama come and visit me.  It was his first time in beautiful sunny SoCal, and I wanted him to see all the great places worth going.  So naturally, one of the first places we went to was the Trinity Broadcasting Network headquarters in Costa Mesa, CA.  And did we have a time...  urlLink       I'm sure that you've seen this station on television before - you know, with the elaborate gold trim sets, the lady with purple hair, lots of talk about Jesus and whatnot.  I used to watch this station every morning as I got ready for work.  I marvelled at it the same way people can't stop staring at a car wreck when they pass by one.    The best part of the TBN headquarters (besides the fact that it's free) is the gift shop.  Lots of great finds there, let me tell you.  But the one that beats them all out is the "Bible Bar."  Yes, that's right - it's a nutrition bar made from the 7 foods of Deuteronomy 8:8.  And yes, it's really called the "Bible Bar."  You'll find in the section of Holy Dietery Supplements (I kid you not).  I bought one, and it's actually quite tastey.  God knows his ingredients.   urlLink    The cabinet of Holy Nutritional Supplements  There's also a free movie theatre (it was playing "Megiddo" when we went), a small cafe, and the primary sound stage where all the magic happens.  My friend and I were able to walk into the the stage, which was empty, without anyone around to ask us any questions.  And there was no one on the stage, which was a bit eerie.  I could have stolen a TV camera if I wanted (I didn't because I don't want to deal with the wrath of God for the rest of my life -  I have enough problems as it is).   urlLink    Eerily empty stage...

      The first day of my new life up in Los Angeles (yesterday) started with quite a bang.  No, I mean literally, a bang.  You see, I got myself into a car accident yesterday.  I was driving down a road and I went over a hill and there was an intersection where a guy pulled out to make a left in front of me, and I clipped his rear end.  No one was hurt, but there was damage to both vehicles.  The big problem is no one knows who was at fault.  We both claim that we had green lights, there are no witnesses, and no police report.  So I still don't know exactly how things will work out, whose fault it's going to be, and whose insurance pays what, and what comes out of my pocket.  Needless to say I'm not terribly happy about the entire situation.  It's definitly not what I needed right now.  I'm stressed out enough as it is about moving, finding a new job, starting a new life, etc.  But hey, if I've got to be stressed out, then why shouldn't I be stressed to the end of my rope, right?  I mean, I've got to go for the gusto, you know?  Whatever, I'm just trying to justify something that there is no justification for.  When things like this happen, I like to think that everything happens for reason (sometimes I believe that, sometimes I don't).  But if there is a reason for this, dammit, it better be good.  I had a dream the night before it happened that someone shot me in the head and I lived through it.  I keep thinking that the dream had something to do with the accident, but that's just me being speculative and weird.

      I got an email from the editor of a short story book I submitted to a month or two ago saying that they wanted to include one of my shorts in the book.  It's a collection of short stories from 32 Los Angeles based writers.  It will be available at your neighborhood  urlLink Borders ,  urlLink Barnes & Noble , or other major book retailer by winter.  This couldn't have come at a better time, either.  It gives me incentive to keep writing and keep sending my stuff out.  I need to do it more often.  It's like I don't really take my creative pursuits seriously very often.  And I should, if this is what I want to do (which I can't think of anything else I've found that makes me happy to do - and believe me, I've tried).  But with my last day at my office job being tomorrow, and not having anything on the horizon, maybe I'll get a little fire lit under my ass to start working harder on my creative endeavors and the things that make me feel really good about myself.  Like my writing, and my relationships.  I feel like I've spent the last couple of years since college just dicking around.  I need to get serious about what I want out of life.  You only get one, but if you do it right, one is enough.    I've always used the excuse of "I just need to work more and make a little more money" to keep from doing what I really want to do because in the end I'm probably just afraid of screwing up.  But inaction is saying you've screwed up before you ever gave it a fair shot.

      This is the week of big changes for me.  Hell, this is the month of giant changes for me.  In a matter of weeks, my life will resemble very little has resembled for the last year and a half.  But lets start with this week.  These are my last days in my current apartment in Huntington Beach, CA, a pleasant little beach city in Orange County.  My lease is up and I'm going to be free of this place by August 7.  My roommate already left - he caught a plane back home to Florida last Sunday and doesn't plan on coming back to California.  So long, Eric.  Give 'em hell on the east coast.  Last Sunday was also the day of apartment hunting for me and my new roommate Vinnie - a fella I met working at a theatre here in Orange County.  The best thing to do when looking for an apartment out in Los Angeles is to forget about the westsiderentals and and other apartment finders.  Just drive around unti you find a neighborhood you like.  Then go up and down the streets looking for "apartment available" signs.  If you do that a couple of times and they're too expensive, then find another neighborhood.    Personally, Vinnie and I picked Burbank because it's cheap, it's nice, it's not far from Hollywood, and our friends live there.  Also, if you get lucky (like we did) you'll find a good place within walking distance to the Media Center, where you have everything you need to survive (bars and movie theatres).  We looked at a couple of places before we settled on the one we wanted.  I had looked at it a week before and was surprised to see it still available, but there are tons of apartments for rent right now.  It's a good time to be looking for a place.  Vinnie dug it as much as I did, so we put in the application.  Now, we were both a little concerned about the application process and if we would be accepted for the apartment because of one nagging little issue that plagues both of us at the moment.  We don't have jobs.  Well, technically speaking.  I'm doing the handyman stuff and that's paying pretty well, but it's not a real job.  I don't have a real boss or a real company or anything like that.  Vinnie, well, he's got nothing.  So what did we do?  Naturally, we lied on the application.  Now, I'm not one to lie often, and I don't like doing it, but for the sake of getting a place to live by the weekend, it had to be done.  But kids, don't try this at home.  It will just get you into trouble.  It will probably get me into trouble as well, but so would sleeping on a park bench.  Six of one, half a dozen of the other - I had to choose.  I was a bit worried that they would find us out when they did the credit check thing, but I got the call today from the apartment manager saying we got the place and could move in whenever we signed the lease.    It's a great place, too, cheaper and larger than the one I live in now.  Nice breeze, street front balcony, all the comforts of home, I suppose.  It's got nice character, too, because it was built in 1972 - it has a quirky kitch look to it.  Well, I like it.  I'll post pictures after the move.
