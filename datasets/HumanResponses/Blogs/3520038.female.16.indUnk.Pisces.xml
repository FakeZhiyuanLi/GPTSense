      ok offcially my life is a livin chaos.  I hate it w/a passion.  I woke up this morning and banged my head on the fuckin headboard.  Thats a nice way 2 start out the day ?!?!?!?!? I ended up takin the usaul shower got dress in a hurry, cuz my mom wuz goin 2 take me job huntin in fuckin 7:30 in the morning !!! Ok most stores dont open till ten !!  >:O  Then my sister would not shut the hell up.  Would the real fuckin big mouth PLEASE SHUT UP !! PLEASE SHUT UP !!! My god !! I swear I woulda killed her if she didnt.  I ended up slapping her only 2 actually scratch her.  Yea damn long nails come in handy sumtimes. Heh heh. Yes I drew blood.  HA HA !! THE SITE OF RED BLOOD !! GREAT TERRIFIC SITE !! HA HA  !! Followed by miserable cries from hell !! Omg shes annoying she wont shut the hell up.  I need ducktape seriously.  My mom saw this only 2 grab my arm digging her nails deep in my skin the best she could.  I stared rite in2 her eyes.  And showed no pain.  My arm went numb first so I really felt none.  Or my moms weak.  Or the theory of me becoming immune 2 pain is actually true.  HA HA !!  Lots of blood went down my arm again.  Kelsey gets 2 see the cut !! MWHAHHAHA !!  I think im goin mad if I luv the site of blood.  I dont know 2 many videogames and action movies goin 2 my head ?? Or just the taste and color turns me on who knows... lol.  I applied at Fashion Bug, Target and fuckin mcdonalds.  Ack. Damn my life suxs.  I had 2 work 4 the cash im gettin 2 4 the Spiderman 2 movie I get 2 see 2morow w/Kelsey.  Yea Im sleeping over her house and goin 2 another pool party. YEA!  Meep !! Away from this damn hell.  Phew I thought satan had me there 4 a second.  I think im startin 2 turn in2 an athiest.  Im startin 2 doubt a lot of things in life.  There seems 2 be little hope I have now.  So I dont know what will become of me.  I used 2 actually pray.  Then I realized I never got replys from those prayers.  I guess Im becoming distant.  Lately I dont like 2 be around ppl in general.  I dont mind friends obviously, but family ack I just want 2 break free from.  Well gotsa goes     xoxoxoxoxo

      Desiree I know u read this blog, but I had the same damn problems while mowing the grass, but I had one of those damn push ones not the tractor .... TT-TT I wuz forced out of my humble bed round bout eleven in the morning.  I had woken up by my mom screamin in my damn ears 2 mow the grass before it storms.  Obviously Im not thrilled 2 see her gacking eyes in my face and end up closing my eyes back 2 bed for another twenty minutes.  More screaming erupted at my face once more after I wouldnt get up so I literally roll out of my bed turn on my computer and blast music out of my speakers.  Ironically the song "Its my Life" Came on from my playlist.  Ha Ha... only if she would of noticed it.  I wuz so tired that I actually started takin off my clothes almost rite in front of her.  Which made her slam the door.  I hadvn't done that in a while. Heh heh. Maybe I should do that more often so she stops the fuckin yellin ha ha.  I ended up throwing on a skirt and tanktop ha ha.  Mowing the lawn w/a skirt on. Man I must have been dead tired.  Afterwards I got online and talked 2 shiya a bit.  I told her my arms hurt from pushing that lard of junk metal round my yard.  She wuz like u mow the lawn?  I wuz like yea.  She said " Christine, Thats a man's job !"  I wuz like well im independent !! lol I dont need a man 2 do the work he he.  Lol That wuz funny as hell.  I played more of my N64 games 2day.  I guess I need a break from that damn PS2.  It's really starting 2 bored me w/those same old games I have. Ack.  My dad wuz yellin real loud at dinner.  I wuz quiet the whole time I guess I wasnt in the mood 2 get bitched at.  My hair is gettin really long... I dont know if I should grow it out anymore or get it cut...  I wuz goin 2 get my nails airbrushed pink w/butterflies on them.  And the Japanese symbol 4 butterfly on them.  Cute.  Anyways enough bout manicures... ha ha.  Im bored as hell.  Everyone is at Hershey Park and Im not.  Thats cuz I have no money like usual.  O yea I didnt go job huntin 2day cuz I just didnt feel like it.  My mom is yellin that she will take me 2morow but I really could careless I just want money not work.  That would take the time I have w/my friends away, which I dont want at all.  But I need money 4 Otakon and its comming soon.  Yea, I cant go 2 arizona or california this summer im goin 2 that "sunshine" state.  That moto is so overated.  It should be called the puke up mexican state.  Ack I dont want 2 go.  Im goin 2 have 2.  Well they have oriental stuff down there I want 2 get this dress down there.  But its like really really short.... But o well who in the hell cares?? I sure as hell dont.  Man Im really freezing my ass off.  I hate this damn house. Shiya gets 2 sleep over when she comes from California yea!! Des is also obviously !! She has 2 come everywhere w/me he he ^-^  Man 2day wuz another boring as hell day like fuckin USUAL !! ACK I SHOULD RUNAWAY. Seriously and escape this hick state.  Shiya im running 2 California 2 live w/u !!  HE HE... Well gotsa goes   Stella xoxoxoxo

      I had a vision last nite of the past reflecting upon 2day and it happened... Im not goin in2 detail of how that effected me on or how I will get over it.  Im just emotionaly and mentally hurt.  My life seems 2 get worse and depressing by the minute.  Nuthin seems 2 change.  More feuds more arguments more tears shed and more emotional wars with myself.  I miss hanging w/my friends and talkin 2 them bout problems, anime, and stuff.  I feel sick rite now because of all the cryin I had 2 endure all day.  We went out 2 eat at the Texas Roadhouse.  We were celebrating my dad starting his buisness.  It felt like I wuz celebrating my failures.  It wasnt a comfortable situations.  It felt like I wuz sitting with strangers.  I felt so much like trash or sumone else's shit... My dad ended up buying me the biggest steak there wuz 4 me... I wuz like i cant eat all this...  I just kinda sat there not talkin 2 anyone or look anyone in the eyes.  I   Well  xoxoxoxo Stella

      Last nite would have been one of the severe feuds I have been in w/my mom.  I got pissed off w/my sister cuz she wuz in my room.  I just dont like her period.  Shes like a plague 2 me.  I dont want 2 touch her or be near her.  Anything she does makes me sick.  Well I punched her 2 get out of my room and that did nuthin so I ended up grabbing her by the wrist and pulling her on the ground 2 get her out of my room.  But everyone knows my damn sister she cries and whines about the most simplest pain.  Shes like a cryin chimpanze.  Damn she drives me insane.  My mom thought i pinched her or sum shit like that and ended up bitch slapping me several times.  She expects me 2 cry over that little pain,ridiculous.  I just kinda have 2 laugh in her face sumtimes.  Its just hysterical how weak my mom has gotten or how  immune im startin 2 become 2 pain.  My mom yelled at me 2 get of the god damn internet once more.  She look like she wuz ready 2 destroy my monitor... Scary.  Anyways I got pissed when i shut down the computer and ended up throwing my mouse at her.  The mouse ended up landing in the blue paint can.  Dammit now my mouse dosent click that well anymore.  O well thats my fault 4 throwing one of my enraged anger bursts.  My mom held this paint knife scrapper up 2 me.  I ended up punching it.  It sliced my finger.  Now I offically have several cuts on my right hand.  Blood ran down my hand and wrist. My whole arm wuz covered in blood.  But when i get that pissed I dont notice the pain I just want 2 inflict more pain.  So I ended up clutching my nails in2 the galge 2 make it worse. Obviously more blood ran down my arm.  I just cleaned it up and put a bandaid on it.  I dont even think my mom saw the cut.  I didnt show her the blood or nuthin.  O well.  I took off that crappy ass nail polish cuz it looked like shit.  I wuz extremly in a weird kinda feeling all this morning.  I had that butterfly feeling in my stomach the whole morning.  That kinda feeling when ur really excited or u felt like u did sumthing bad.  I had that the whole time.  Then I had one of those miserable migraines.  I passed out.  Literally this is my first time ever passing out.  I wuz laying on my bed and ended up blacking out.  I think it wuz because Ive been extremly stressed out lately. I wuz goin 2 get the booklet 2 study 4 my permit 2day.  !!  Im getting SoulCalibur 2 soon.  Hopefully since were on a money shortage.  I dont have fuckin shit and dont have a job.  I need 2 stop complaining.  O yea Scott, Des, and I r goin 2 Park City mall soon.  My mom is takin us.  I cant believe shes that nice 2day... ha ha...

Des and I r goin 2 make our own freestyle routine up 4 ddr.  I keep practicing that game over and over again.  I want 2 remember the whole intire sequence of arrows on Paranoia Clean Mix, Era, Holic, and Ecstasy.  My head really hurts.  I really should lay down before I pass out. I want 2 watch Gundam Seed !!! Ack !! Im really starting 2 doubt that I can go 2 Otakon this year now.  DAMMIT THIS IS FUCKIN BULLSHIT.  I looked 4ward 2 this thing all year.

My stomach feels tight right now.    I wish my ddr pad would work.  I feel like offical shit.  I want Soul Calibur 2 !!! Ack dammit.  I still need StarCraft.  And Diablo 2 dosent look bad.  I watched Aaron play it looks pretty awesum.  Then I need this one Ps2 game its like FinalFantasy in away but its way cooler ha ha.  My hand hurts from typing cuz my hand is cut.  But thats my own damn fault.  Putting my toungue on it helps.... lol.  I wanna go 2 bed.

I cut myself w/my pocket knife by accident.  I have this gauge on my finger now. Ack.  I couldn't go bowling.  My family is strapped 4 cash.  And now I don't think I can go 2 Otakon.  My life is the most miserable unsufficent life out in this damn world.  I wuz so bored I made dinner from scratch and made chocolate cake. I rather of made strawberry or vanilla instead but that all we fuckin had.  Des made a group blog, so now I have 2 undergo one more writing process of the day by writing in that blog now. Fun.  I dont even know y i keep this damn thing now.  Maybe cuz Im bored as hell and have no life. Ha Ha.  I cant take martial arts this summer.  That job never called me.  So im screwed.  I dont even have enough money 2 go out and get sum damn supplies.  I wuz real pissed off at my mom, 2day well that goes 4 any day.  I told her 2 leave me home when they go on that family vacation and save the money that they would of spent 4 me 2 save 4 Otakon.  Im that desperate 2 go.  Im willing 2 wash cars in a bikini 4 christs sake.  I just need the god damn money !! Ack!!  Des is coming 2 my house 2morow.  Maybe we can play more ps2 games.  I beat all my pc demos I had on my computer. Now im bored again.  I just went out 2 Sam's Club and I felt like cryin again 4 absolutly no reason.  I want 2 go swimming again.  I want 2 go 2 Miami Flordia !! Ahhhhh... the waves and walking pieces of meat... ha ha.  Well more then ninety percent is not even my type. So yea.  I get disturbed real eaisly when I guy I dont like tries 2 hang all over me.  Thats one of the reasons y martial arts is a virtue.  2 kick sum ass ecspecially since now im goin 2 have 2 go 2 these truck stops.... Omg I really dont want 2 think about it.  Ecspecially now just goin 2 the mall or arcade, and video game stores and including comic stores I get these stares that just urk me.  I dont mind 2 a certain point, but when that person touches me I will kill them.  This reminds me of the fuckin time when I went 2 a friend's party.  It wuz Nichole's 16th bday, and she invited me up 2 the skating rink.  I wuz like ok since I have nuthin else better 2 do.  I wuz skatin with Kaitlyn and I thought she wuz behind me.  Well I felt a pair of hands grab my waist.  I still thought it wuz Kaitlyn. Then it went 2 my ass still thought it wuz Kaitlyn.  Yea then I finally turn around and there wuz this guy who I didnt even know holding me!! I wuz like what the fuck?? I ended up punching him.  Yes I didnt bitch slap im not like this girly pricks. Later that nite he ends askin 4 4giveness.  Yet this is the funny ass part he had a girlfriend. Right there watchin the whole thing like nuthin happened.  If i wuz her I would of dumped his sorry ass rite there and then. Wait i wouldnt do just that I would have 2 beat the shit outa him and make him look like a jackass.  Damn im violent but i dont tolerate ppls shit anymore.  Lot of ppl just say I dont like 2 get close 2 anyone.  Some think I got hurt in the past or sumthing.  No I didnt. Its just I have personal issues 2 work through.  I really dont like discussing it.  I dont even like writing about it.  I need 2 study 4 my permit. Dammit.  I need a car.  Dammit.  I need money 4 Otakon... Dammit!!  Duncan wuz my old guy friend which I hadvnt spoken 2 in like 2 years.  Well he told me im am a multipersonality kind of person.  Most ppl dont see the whole thing.  Some ppl get only that one side of me thats it.  I have a hyper, lost, happy side (school friends).  Then I have the depressed and gloomy state (home), Party grl wild out just 4 sum fun(parties), Then the dreamy state.  I might get sumthing done w/my hair later I dont know yet.  I might get pink highlights.  Or a wavy perm.  My hair is naturally wavy I guess I just want it 2 be more springy!!  I told a couple of my friends bout dyeing my hair color.  Everyone wants me 2 keep it blonde!!  I guess it matches my personality. ha ha. O well whats new, o its true the blondes have all the fun ha ha.  Im in the im offically bored mode.  This has been goin on 4 the past 5 damn days.  I want a new videogame!!  I feel like sleepin on my comfy silk blankets. Blue Metallic SILK !! Omg !!  My dog slept w/me last nite.  I usually like 2 sleep w/only undergarments and thats it, yea well I think my mom saw me like that this morning when she took buster out of my room.  O well.  I dont care anymore.

I guess I wuz bummed out ha ha... anyways I got a shower... i must have broke some kinda record cuz I wuz in the shower 4 like 45 minutes when it only takes me like five... omfg... lol  Sarah... one of my senior friends wants me 2 get 2gether w/her sumtime again, cant wait actually. Im goin 2 a "party" again 2morow... w/sum friends.  I rented Kill Bill and the Last Samurai 2day 2 watch o and Scary Movie III... Damn I rent 2 many serious movies, excludin Scary Movie of course. I guess Im playin more video games 4 the ps2 and pc, 2morow YEA !!! DDR... StarCraft(hopefully so i get the hang of the game) I want 2 watch a really scary gorey movie. Nothing really scares me anymore. Seriously. If I saw Freddy Crougar in front of me I would have 2 laugh... Who in the hell wears a stripped shirt w/hat and goes around w/knives as fingernails if ur a guy??? O well wolverine does but hes kewl as hell, but Freddy?? Give me a fuckin break.  I probaly could create some better scary movies then these horror creators... there more like comedys 2 me.  Theres always sum chick running around naked... She always dies. Ha Ha same damn story line. Then u have the "creepy" chick. This grl always lives because shes real smart but always gets in those bad situations were a guy risks his life 4 her. Um he dies she lives.  Then u have the black man. Usually he dies. But in sum movies he ends up bein in the group of survivors. Then u have the horny male. This is the guy who falls 4 the nude chick. They both die. Then u have the other guy who dosent confess his feelings at the beginning of the movie 4 the creepy chick. Later on in the movie he confesses them 2 her and they both seem 2 kiss and shit then they both live 4ever after... Or do they??? The serial killer, stalker, monster, freddy, or even Jason always comes back 4 them.  I know what u did last summer, Jason, Michael Myers, Freddy,Candyman, PinHead, and many more follow that same layout.  What a damn shame... Cant these movie producers think of sumthing better??? Or do they like 2 copy each other?? No wonder im never scared. Ha Ha. Most of them r just blood guts and intestines ripped out... Hearts ect.  Big fuckin deal. O well... things r just boring now. In the movie industry... I guess thats y I really stopped watchin them. O yea... my mom wuz lookin at lets clean this up some..."pictures" w/her friend. ACK!!! Dammit. Im so bored... Y on this god foresaken hell wuz I put on this earth??? 2 be bored as hell???  I really want 2 join the service and be put in combat, but this damn sexist nation only wants guys in combat. DAMMIT I KNOW HOW 2 USE A GUN NOW GIVE ME SOME DAMN FIRE POWER!! I WILL RIP SUM BALLS OFF THOSE DAMN DEPRIVED BIN LADEN FUCK SLAVES !!! I swear i just want 2 rip sumones head of 4 no deprived reason. I must be sufferin from real deep depression or sumthing.  I went 2 like 2 therapists and they couldnt help my sorry ass!!  I want 2 take martial arts this summer but I cant cuz I couldnt get a job at the time... damn my life suxs... Well gotsa goes  xoxoxoxo  aka:Nymphomaniac

I guess they figured out I have anger managment problems... TT-TT Me and my damn personal problems. They said they would call me soon cuz they were desperate 4 workers.  Well Im desperate 4 cash 4 otakon. I need money. I need 2 buy foam, crosspunisher necklace, combat boots, cross earrings, preregister, and save money up 2 spend there.  I have the skirt done I just need 2 do the shirt.  I got the ripped up pantyhose 2 go w/it so it looks like I just got out of a battle so yea. Then I need cigerettes... heh heh. Fake that is.  I guess after my grandmother died of three different kinds of cancer Ive never been in2 it.  My family so prone 2 cancer its ridiculous.  Thats y ive been extra careful.  It wuz stormin again earlier. I went in the rain 2 get wet. I have 2 do that everytime it rains. Im goin 2 another cook out on saturday and bowling sunday. I have 2 call stephanie. I hope i got that job... waaaaaaa  I walked Buster my dog around our neighborhood. Which I never do Cuz i just hate our neighbors and shit and this story only proves a point what I have 2 deal w/everyday from horny dogs in heat... ha ha.  Yea like I said I wuz walkin my golden Retriever around the neighborhood when I wuz coming back around there wuz a whole bunch of these construction workers out. TT-TT  They started whistling and shit. Ugh I just tried 2 cover up my anger 4 the rednecks in2 a cute sweet smile.(die miserable asswipes) The guys whistled when they pulled away in their pick up truck. Then the next truck comes up 2 me tellin me 2 ignore them, but yet this is the funny ass part. He slowly like at 2 mph goes up the hill starin in the rear-view mirrior checkin me out !!! I wuz like ugh... stupid bastard go 2 hell!! I looked like that legally blonde chick 2day... heh heh. Pink chain sleeve shirt, blonde hair, slim, streach jeans. My dog even matched my haircolor. We looked like twins...um thats kinda bad. I squirted my dog down with the hose cuz he wuz dyin of heat. I cant wait till otakon I hope I got this job im so desperate !!!  My friends want me 2 get a boyfriend... um that just cant happen over nite... wait it could heh heh.  I guess im not in the datin mood.  But that could always change later on I guess. Ive been sleepin all day. Im real tired I went 2 bed at 2 this morning. That dosent matter I am just more tired then usual 2day. I have 2 sleep on the damn couch again.  Kelsey is yellin at me now 4 not takin her 2 taco bell cuz shes been cravin tacos 4 a while now... My dad just got home.  I cant remember what I wuz suppose 2 tell him. O well!! I just gota get in another damn argument and soak my hands in my blood once more... Well gota goes

      I had this dream like several nights ago, but it won't get out of my head.  I was at the mall with desiree and I was wearing my grandmother's wedding ring (she gave it 2 me on my 16th birthday) Once my ring fell 2 the floor everyone's ring fell 2 the ground.  The dream focused on this one classring with a blue gem in the center.  A guy comes up to me giving me back my ring while everyone elses lay on the floor. I thank him then me and des go to a candy store.  The whole intire left side of the candy store was empty.  The lady who owned the place said that the "grocery" store was closed, but yet this is a candy store!  Then I woke up... that wuz a weird confusing dream...  But yet I cant get it off my mind.    2day wuz the last day of skewl !! Finally... I did good i passed i know so far!! XD  Usually I fail... I need 2 start on my cosplay costume.... Im so damn lazy.  I have the outfit and everything that I want sketched out, I just need 2 draw the pattern, cut out, and sew.  Its summer vacation I should get started dammit !! Otakon is coming the end of july in2 the 1st of august... I need 2 get 2gether sum cash and fast!!  I need 2 preregister !!! WAAAAAAAA !!! Such a rush... damn.    *Listening 2 Legato's theme from Trigun and Prodigy Voodoo People!!*  I want StarCraft!!! Life is such a bitch... Damn I feel like I should waste sum years in the army... Ha Ha I want 2 be in combat not a nurse or cook thats chicken shit.  I swear I want 2 be equiped with a assualt rifle and rocket launcher and take out all my anger and frustration on that damn Bin Laden!! DIE BITCH !!  *calms down..*  Im goin 2 a party 2morow... a pool party... heh heh.  I dont like goin 2 parties w/ppl I really dont know 2 well.  I should though get out and celebrate im out of that shit plant skewl until .... 2 and half months are over.  I just looked on the negative side of that... great now im depressed again... TT-TT  All my guy friends and des came over 4 our PS2 tournament and BBQ cook out. It wuz great but I wuz real tired at the end. DDR, Virtual Fighter 4, Jet Lei Rise 2 Honor, FFX we all played.  Then we watch Matrix Revolutions.  I have 2 say im impressed.  I thought it would sux as much as the second one did.  They were real cheesy w/the damn computer graphics.The third was a lot smoother and dosent look like it came from a PS2 game... heh heh. My favorite Matrix though is still the first.  I guess I like the classics.

Well lets say me and a few select other r ourselves and dont try 2 act like something were not.  Im sick of this poser this sterotype that.  Damn ppl just be urself... thats the only way I would accept u.  It's just our skewl... is messed up, and the time is coming fast for me 2 graduate in 2 years... thanx christ.  I swear tha place is a hell hole and im dying 2 live. Heh heh... lets just say theres a very rare account of anime lovers... DDR lovers and grl video game fanatics...

      Ok my obsessions revolve around DDR (dance dance revolution), anime, gaming, american comics, manga, and computers. Damn I sound like a real knocked up nerd, but who in the hell cares.  My life is simple but yet incomplete.  Life is boring in Pennsylvaina... Wheres the action like skydiving and bungee jumping.  Man I sound like a risk taker but o well.  The security gaurd came after me in the mall... Cuz some dumb bitch butted in front of me 2 play ddr.  Did I say she suxed cock??? Well she did.

      My 1st ever journal entry... Im really pathetic. Ive been questioning a lot about my life and my well being. I always felt different then everyone else, in an inhuman sort of way. Why in the hell wuz I put here in this god foresaken earth? I dont want 2 live the "normal life". Go 2 skewl graduate, go out on dates, party, go 2 a college, marry, and have a couple kids and drop dead...  I dont want that "life's plan" Life is like a dream to me nothing seems real... not even this reality.  It seems like Im having a hard time distinguishing between the 2.  Then about dating... Jake asked me why am I not with someone... I actually keep thinking about that. I feel like Im waiting for the "one". Not just any guy 2 date... im a pretty I guess romantic person with that someone. I sound a bit 2 mature in this journal entry... Maybe wisedom lies within one's heart and not mind. Jake told me that both him and Scott said that I wuz the "love connection" in our school. Ive set up many of my friends 2gether.  I like 2 see my friends happy and in love. It give me so much happiness... I care so much more about my friends then I do myself. Now I need 2 get Monnica 2gether w/someone. :) Both Scott n Jake rely on me 4 some of their grl questions... lol It feels great 2 relate with them. I hope Desiree gets what she wants... same w/Becca, Monnica, and even Kelsey. Maybe I have no love, because I give it 2 all my friends and keep none 4 myself. Maybe Im going 2 find it later in life. I could careless about dating anyone right now.Im so insaclusive about what I want out of my life... I don't know what I want 2 do after High School. And it hurts... I think everyday about it. I dont want 2 draw.. I dont want 2 be an unknown "civilian". I want 2 be a leader. It wuz my birth right to be one... And I will always pravail 2 be one. Someone powerful and recognized. Im sick and tired of being a "girl" Always classified as something weak and petty. House wife, chores, childern, marriage. Ugh, society disguists me. I dont want any of it. I still cant find myself... I feel so lost and helpless. Life is a blur 2 me. I wish I could dream 4ever... Everything is hidden in my subconsious. I love trance music. I lay on my bed and dream of myself glistening with radiant beauty. My inner beauty showing the brightest. I never show anyone. No one seems 2 know the "real me" Hidden under this mask... Tryin 2 make it through reality. My real self is more quiet and calmed down, mysterious, yet strong. I lock myself in this damn room 2 escape this harassment the arguments the facts and not the fiction. I feel like submerging in water 2 clean myself away from this reality and escape time. I love space and angels. I see death, chasing, kisses, tornadoes, violence, and agony in my dreams lately. I seem 2 sense things around me and I dream about them. I killed a demon in my dream that wuz in the shape of a blackcat. What do these dreams want of me? My own despair? I keep seeing things hallucinating a lot. I saw a spider and a beetle crawling next 2 me at night. But I fall asleep I know there not real... but they move like they r... Something grabbed my foot in the night. But I fell right back 2 sleep. Do they want my own death? Am I showing signs of major depression getting 2 me mentally? Or just 2 terrorize and plague my well being? I had an out of the body experience... I never told anyone including my mom about it. She would only think I wuz lying, fibbing. Im really scared of my own mind somehow... Inner demons... I pray 2 god... a god I believe in... Has god given me the gift of madness? Am I loosing myself? Dreams come 2 warn me. Dreams that told me my grandmother wuz going 2 die soon... the next day I get a phone call that shes severally ill and we should go see her... I knew it.  My dream wuz me and my mother holding hands walking through a graveyard... Pretty pink shades glowed the tombstones were pretty yet the setting seemed quite eerie... i felt sick in my stomach when i woke up somthing didnt seem right... Why didnt my mother get the dream y did it have 2 me?? Do i sense death? I always felt like I had a strong sixth sense, but i really dont tell anyone because i dont want them 2 think im crazy or something. I still have dreams about my grandmother... Like her being a nurse... My mom said she wanted 2 be nurse. I never knew that... Shes happy right now It seems in my dreams... and shes like a hero 2 me when she wuz a nurse. When I wuz three I talked 2 ghosts in my uncles apartment... It wuz haunted. My grandmother and my mom heard me always talkin 2 the childern in the house. Maybe I do have a special gift 2 sense the dead... When we went 2 NY I wuz afraid 2 go 2 ellis isle cuz I heard u feel ghost prescences and stuff... I thought I might actually see them... God gave me so many gifts it almost seems wrong of me. Im never really consciously alive... Thats the thing I fail in life. I can never seem 2 wake up...I hate how life is a schedule... School, School, School.... Uhhh another life hassle. I ask so many questions but none can ever be answered. Im the only one like this... I feel so alone even when Im with my friends. My life is like a tragic epic. Nothing is ever negative or positive 2 me... It just is. I want 2 live in the water. The water's movements and sound is so heavenly and dreamy 2 me. I just want 2 slip away. I want 2 hold an angel's hand and look in2 her gorgous eyes. And remember a dream of a stream and a meadow of wildflowers lookin over a mountain with huge dropping waterfalls. When life just began. What is heaven? Is it our dreams? When I sleep,dance, or even awake Im still dreaming. Dreaming of another place for away from here. Maybe thats y I want 2 move out of this hick state. 2 escape everything and become the person I trully am. I still dont know y i hide. I guess I dont want ppl 2 think that im crzy insane. im not. I just want 2 be taken away and put in2 a diffrent reality for my dreams. I think I just explained my inner brain. Ha, Ha... I just want 2 be left alone 2 dream and draw what I see... bright colors. Fantasies of space and sightings of angels...It feels so good 2 write down my thoughts... I dont feel as depressed or angry at the world as much.

      The wait 4 Otakon is finally over.  I was up all last nite cuz I couldn't get any sleep, because I was that anxious 4 Otakon.  I got up at 4:00 in the morning to get a shower, shave, blow dry my hair, and Straighten it.  I did makeup and everything.  Everything wuz perfect.  Till I put the damn crosspunisher in the car.  My mom has this tiny ass sports car... so it got smushed.  I met up w/Desiree, Shiya and Ericka at 6:00 in the morning.  They finished their touches 2 their costumes.  I think we left bout 7:00 with Desiree's mom.  We had the hardest time tryin 2 fit the crosspunisher in the car... ahhhh.  Well we met up w/Scott, Aaron and Jake at K-mart then departed 4 otakon.  Took bout 45 minutes 2 get 2 Baltimore, Maryland.  When we got out of the car we splitted up.  Desiree went w/Scott, Jake and Aaron in the preregistering line.  I took Ericka holding her hand while Shiya followed 2 the registering line.  The line wuz really really REEEEAAAALLLYYYY LONG.... ahhhh.  Every foot I heard sum guy saying... how hot I wuz, or Female wolfwood. I was like stoooopppitttt.  O yea I got my picture w/the Jewish Wolfwood yea! He asked I adore him. ^_^;; lol.  Anyways we got in line and sum guy wuz like I think all 4 of us r in the wrong line so he guides us round a block and looses us.  Im like what the hell kid.  God...  We went back 2 the same line that wuz rite in the first place.  I had 2 go past that line again... ahhhh more comments.  Finally we got 2 the end of the line and I wuz behind this awesum hellsing chick.  We talked a bit I got a picture, but it didn't come out.  That really pissed me off... TT_TT  I saw this ATHF moon guy and asked him 2 give me the finger!! HA HA HE DID !!! Im so happy!! lol.  We had 2 wait 3 full hours to actually register... God that really made me weak in the legs.  Boots can really kill u.  When we got inside sum guy asked y I didnt stop 4 a pic 4 him... I wuz like sry I didnt hear u and I wuz in a rush lol.  Ahhh then he asked if he could be in the picture w/me.  I wuz like ok... this guy wuz like omg... FAT!! AHHHH HE LEANED RITE UP AGAINST ME.  I wuz thinkin sumone save me!  Another wolfwood or vash could save another wolfwood in need, well there wasnt any at the time...  That wuz like my 5th picture since outside in the line and gettin inside 4 a second. I wuz depressed like the first hour or 2 we were inside cuz the pain and waitin made me agervated.  This grl came up 2 me and complemented on my costume.  Well that happened several times...  We went around in the dealer's room.  My legs were really numb.  And I gave up on the carrying strap so I just tossed the thing over my shoulder.  Everyone wuz rite up against each other.  I wuz knocking ppl in the head w/my crosspunisher.  That really really suxed lol.  I bought a Wolfwood keychain and a stuffed grunty.  Several other ppl asked 4 a picture.  Then we went out and just kinda walked around.  We walked around 4 sumthing 2 eat and gave up lookin 4 a restraunt outside the convention.  We sat down inside and just rested.  Got up went back 2 the dealers room were shiya, desiree and ericka bought sum stuff.  We sat down again sum guy asked 4 my picture again and I did a pretty nice pose and he looked really happy :) I made sumone happy yea!! lol  Couple other ppl asked again.  Then we had 2 go 2 my Trigun Photoshoot.  A Vash told me 2 follow him and wolfwood, millie and meryl cuz I had no idea where the fountains were.  Well when I waited w/Vash and Wolfwood and the Vash said she looks sexier then u man... to Wolfwood who is my online friend.  He wuz like I hope so she is a grl. lmao.  I talked 2 the grly cat Kuroneko.  She wuz really cute and kewl.  Then we did the shoot.  Ahh 2 kewl.  Then afterwards This guy asked 4 my picture.  I wuz like okay I wuz in the posing mood so I did this really sexy one.  I put the crosspunisher on the ground between my legs and pushed my hip out.  ha ha the reaction i got wuz funny as hell.  seven other guys come swooping over w/their cameras.  Bright lights in my eyes!!! ahhhh.  That wuz funny as hell.  Desiree wuz like can I have ur picture 2 ?? So did Shiya I wuz laughing.  We went 2 the AMV showing and the artist alley.  We then left.

So ashamed. -_-;;  Basically I got flashed everywhere I went and complemented... ahhhh So did DESIREE !!! HA HA.  Shiya, Ericka, desiree and I did a group pose several times.  I crushed my crosspunisher.  It wuz ruined before I really got there. I wuz so sad.  Desirees mom wuz lost lol.  We stopped 4 drinks and stopped at a mc donalds.  That wuz about it.

        Well Praise the Lord!! You're Wolfwood!! You're a freakin Badass. Some might say you're a hypocrite, considering you pose to be one thing, but act like another. But that's okay, your heart is usually in the right place and no one can blame you for being human. You also know how to have a good time and are always fun to have around. However you need to cut down on the cigarettes, booze, and woman....    urlLink   Which Tri-guy/gal are you?    Current Music : DeepBlueEyes-FredDurst

      Stella, you have an unusually strong psychic talent in the area of Precognition   This means you have an uncanny ability to look into the future and anticipate what is going to happen. By knowing something's going to occur, you can even change the outcome of events for the better.   Stella, our in-depth analysis also shows you have other hidden psychic strengths including retrocognition (the ability to know what has happened in the past), telepathy (the ability to sense people's true thoughts) and clairvoyance (the ability to see the unknown).

I think its goin 2 happen all over again...  But this time sumone wuz missing and it wuz my dad...And the tombstone wuz blurred the engravements I couldn't read.  And this time the scence didnt have a Warm and eerie feeling at the same time.  It had a eerie and dark evil feeling 2 it.  Death wuz all around me.  The plants were completly dead.  The colors were dark and sickening.  The tombstones were grey and pale yellows.  The pathway 2 the particular stone wuz long and seem 2 go on 4ever.  When we walked back it seemed like eternity to get back.  All the stones were sick 2 look at.  I just remembered I wanted 2 get out of there fast.  I hated that feeling.  I felt evil all around me, It made me sick inside.  It wuz just mom, sister, and I there my dad wuz missing in the whole scene.  So thats y im thinkin that.  I also had a dream before then I me and my dad gettin in2 a car accident it went completly white and I woke up.  All I can do is warn everyone 2 be careful.  I cant stop the situation from happening.  All I can do is say be careful.  Hopefully nuthin will happen, but last time sumthing did happen I cant let it happen I dont want it 2.  I hope nuthin happens cuz if sumthin did happen this family would be in serious trouble.      xoxoxoxo ~ Please help this loss soul ~

      I worked my ass off insanely 2day cuz i didnt want 2 smell paint fumes while my uncle and mom wuz painting the house.  So I worked on my crosspunisher the whole day... I added 2 much detail 2 the straps its unreal.  I made the buckles by hand, my mom saw it and wuz like freakin out over the buckles.  ha ha thats funny as hell.  I probaly spent bout 2, three hours workin on bout ten buckles.  I sodered their pieces 2gether.  I added holes everything.  The proportion is perfect its not 2 big nor 2 small.  perfect.  I didnt have enough money 4 foam.  Like I thought so anyways I found flourecent light bulb boxes these r pretty lengthy but 2 thin so I took insulation foam from my basement walls and just ducktaped a whole hella a lot on the bitch.  I Spent 2 much time wrapping it up and just makin the cross its self. I added literally probaly like four layers of tape on the thing so its sturdy I dont want it 2 fall apart on me at Otakon.  I added those cable ties 2 keep the insulation foam from slipping out of the ducktape underneath.  Its suppose 2 itch like hell well im not itchin... yet anyways.  Its impossiable 2 touch it now Cuz itz completly covered in ducktape and everything else.  I used electric tape 4 the belts.  And used a white cloth that wuz used 2 cover funiture and all from paint splatters.  Ugh... Theres probaly paint everywhere now since I stole it ha ha.  I still need 2 add the carrying strap which i have no idea how 2 do cuz it kinda leans on one side when i carry it... Well I shoulda fixed it but im damn lazy after workin on it all day. Ack.  But it came out sweet as hell. lol   My computer wuz fuckedup all day 2day and yesterday it drove me insane.  g2g    xoxoxoxoxo

      Last nite i had a really sexual dream either I wuz extremly horny when I went to bed or I had a weird dream.  I dunno which really I wuz really tired lol.  Basically I wuz being chased by these ppl who wanted this sponge lookin diamond.  Which wuz in a black velvet bag.  They kept wanting this bag and kept tryin 2 shoot me.  Well anyways this is the part of the dream were it gets a little weird.  Im running past this guy naked... yes nakkee.  He doesnt stop to shoot me and he just stares. Ack. Weird.  I run inside of this mirror and I press my lips up against the mirror inside so im lookin out towards him and then run away.  I end up in this huge Drop above were all the other vermins are at.  Its completly forest.  Its like a huge angled drop.  Its humid and im sweaty, but now im wearing clothes again, but basically Im still almost wearing nuthin cuz Im just wearin black lace.  Like I remeber bein covered in sweat wearin black boots and all.  Im carring two hand pistols, they looked like Walden PPks 7.65 mm to be bout exact.  They were just 2 classic hand guns.  Someone sees me and screams where im at. I bein firing and kill him, but now like several other men are chasing me. I run into another mirror to now be in this circle like forest area.  Theres water down behind this circle of forest and since Im sweaty I took off all my clothes and get rinsed off, even though vermins are lookin 4 me 2 kill me.  Then the same guy spots me and joins me in the water.  We both end up having sex.  I end up waking up in like a hot sweat.  I wuz like omg... what the hell am i dreaming about lol.  And I wuz the only one who could run through these "mirrors".  I look like Xtina A.  in the morning when I wake up now...ack dammit.  I look like I have her hair !! No !! We even do our eyeliner the same in her one video Ive been doing that for like 2 years now !!   I didnt go 2 pincho lake 2day, since none of my friends could go.  I didn't want 2 get stuck w/my annoying sibling the whole damn day.  My mom keeps bitchin at me.  It look like its goin 2 storm soon.  YES RAIN! !! HA HA !!  I should take Buster out for a walk...  My mom has been pissed off at me a lot lately.  SHE TOOK AWAY MY KEYBOARD AND MOUSE LIKE THREE TIMES.  I keep finding more keyboards and mouses around the house.  So its no prob hooking it up 2 my computer.  I need 2 clean my room 2day ack.  But still that wuz a real weird dream.  I looked up some of the terms in a dream dictionary just 4 kicks:  Mirror – Reproductive system (Um what the hell is this suppose 2 mean ?? Im horny ??)  Mirror  In dreams, mirrors can reflect directly, reflect with additions or deletions, or serve as a doorway into another reality as in Alice in Wonderland. The mirror is troubling because it shows us plainly what is before us, forcing us to interpret and evaluate whether or not we like what we see. If the mirror is inconsistent-by adding or deleting images-it is a projection of perceptive versus actual reality. In this case the dream may be a herald that you are misinterpreting the motives of others by not accepting them at face value. (Who or what is being added or deleted from the mirror?)  Finally, the mirror as a doorway to another world is usually a fantasy created by the subconscious. As Alice discovered when she went through the looking glass, the mirror is a metaphor of possible worlds. Does your dream mirror function as a gate or access out of one boundary and into another possible world?  What is more desirable or more threatening about that world?  Sex in Dreams Having sex in a dream indicates one of two things. The first and most common is for the dreamer to get intimate with their male / female side. In cases where, due to upbringing, a person is too male (e.g. causing them to repress their feelings) or too female (e.g. causing them to lack confidence in themselves) the dream tries to heal this by representing their male or female side as something desirable.  Where a dreamer is able to be honest to themselves in private but puts here it is also asking the dreamer to not be afraid of being honest with themselves in front of others.on 'an air' or represses their feelings in public they can dream about having sex in public. (does this mean i have fantasies of having sex in public what the hell ?!?!?)   Black: Meaning: Negativity, i.e. fear, anxiety, hatred, resentment, guilt, depression (no hope / faith). Black and White indicates Intolerance, simplistic extremism - ‘If something is not good it must be evil’  Naked – In public: Show your true nature, be yourself   Diamonds – Crystal healer (heh ??)  Running Running is a traditional symbol of health and vitality in addition to being a means of fleeing potential danger. Thus running could be considered a dream of virility, as well as fear. Usually, in a dream of running in which fear is the dominant emotion, you will find that you can either run all night and successfully escape the danger (albeit with a serious emotional drain), or you find that you continue to falter and stumble, making the object of your fear even more terrifying. In the latter case, try to relate the dream situation to a situation in your life where you are feeling incredible pressure. Sometimes a simple change of perception can solve the problem  GUNS Dreaming about guns and interpreting these dreams depends greatly on your attitude about guns. There are many people who are comfortable with the life-and-death power of guns and use them recreationally. Whether the dreamer is a recreational target-shooter or hunter, guns may not have much significance apart from what is being shot at or who is hunting with you.  (I like guns they r my friend >:D )  Forest Forests can seem magical, daunting, majestic, sacred, dangerous, or phallic. Forests exist in a dream context as something to be enjoyed, embraced, avoided, or traversed. These ideas are central to the interpretation. If a dream is spontaneously set in a forest, then the forest should be considered as a peaceful, benevolent setting or a more dangerous setting. These dreams say something about how the dreamer is experiencing their waking environment.  If the forest is somewhere to go, then who goes in and for what purpose (to acquire or avoid something) is prominent. If it is a singular journey made to acquire good, special powers or wisdom from a forest- dwelling hermit, then the forest is a place of trial and transition. A forest as a hiding place may show that the dreamer is reacting against a feeling of being overexposed to technology and modern business. The desire is for a time of renewal and the majesty of silence in life.  A mixed-couple (in either gender or orientation) journey may give credence to Freudian analysis. Forests can be very romantic places that open us up to desire and potential.  In waking life, is the forest a symbol of peace and rest, being lost or overwhelmed by choices, or discovery?  Do you feel life pressing in on you so densely that you are "unable to see the forest for the trees?"  Kissing Kissing another is often wish-fulfillment or sexual acting out. The wish-fulfillment may not be to kiss per se, but to experience the youthful energy of love. Kissing in this sense is the desire for the awakening of passion, not necessarily the passion acted out.   Nudity Exposure in dreams is a powerful event. Often times, people report dreaming they are nude or dressed only in undergarments. These dreams often reveal the vulnerability that lies just below the surface of our more confident selves. This vulnerability comes from the self that we hide from others. The hiding may be conscious, such as taboo behavior, or less conscious, stemming from a general sense that if you were fully known, you would not be fully accepted.  Water Water is central to the human story. Whether it is the deep, fresh lake, the river that brings life, or the ocean that must claim her dead, water is both friend and enemy at once. When dreams contain this powerful image in any of its forms, understanding the role of the water is essential. Water is a strong symbol in dreams because so often it is the exclamation point of the feelings in the dream. If other objects in a dream are relaxing, a bubbling brook through a meadow is more relaxing. If some symbols generate feelings of fear or anxiety, the tumultuous ocean creates the most anxiety. Water has symbolic, archetypal meaning in that it either provides life, or harbors mystery and danger. This is a reflection of our human experiences with water.   I should start a dream blog...

      I told my mom ten times litterally that I would be sumwhat late from comming back from Desiree's Grandma's place.  And she was like ok.  Anyways during the time I reached Des' place we went to pick up Scott then went to a small grocery place 2 pick up sum things.  We ended up swimming like for two three hours at her grandmothers.  We ate a lot lol.  We were fuckin pigs !! O well.  The BBQ wuz good.  Then we all went back into the pool.  We went swimming for like a while.  I got out an hour early, cuz my tummy hurt.  Des asked her grandmother if we could use the hottub, so we spent like 2 hours in the hottub.  Which I later found out you shouldn't really stay in past fifteen minutes !! Everyone thought I wuz drunk at the time.  My vision got blurry and foggy and tears kept coming out.  Same thing happened to des and scott but Im happy 4 them they weren't drunk lookin lol.  Im like really tan now.  I have major sunburn and a couple mosquito bites. YUCK AS HELL!!  Then we lit off all these fireworks.  Which wuz real cool.  Me and des freaked out when one of them wuz spinning towards us.  Erica wuz hangin all over me!! I wuz like ... ok.  But yea I wuz flushed in the face.  Then when I called Des in the morning I almost puked.  She heard me!! That wuz hilarious as hell.  I called my mom tellin her where I wuz.  MY MOM FLIPPED OUT ON ME SAYING I LIED TO HER FACE WHAT TIME I WOULD BE BACK WHEN I SAID I WOULD BE FUCKIN LATE !!! DAMN BITCH!! I swear I hate her.  She made me look bad, but des' dad and denise, scott, and des heard the whole thing and thought she wuz a load of crap.  I wuz like I told her I would be late.  Ugh !! She hung up on me 2!!  So yea we left and went 2 des house.  We hung out 4 a while 2 light more firecrackers.  I called my mom and my damn sister got a hold of the phone.  SHE WUZ LIKE MOMS PISSED AT U AND SHE WONT PICK UP CUZ SHES SLEEPING.  I said I dont give a god damn I will sleep over.  I will walk fuckin home if I have 2 at midnight I dont fuckin care anymore.  I walk back outside 2 talk 2 des more and a drunk lady wuz huggin me strangely and des.  She kept talkin bout des as a kid.  She seemed real nice.  But she wuz a little crzy.  LOL  I dunno I luv the smell of beer.  She had that scent on her.  It rolled rite off her tongue.  I wuz like BEEEEERRRRRR.   When my mom arrived des' dad came 2 talk 2 her... which made things a lot better but I still got slapped around and cussed at and degraded.  Calling me the whole time a liar 2 her damn face. Screw her.  I hate her now.  She wouldnt let me sleep over.  God damn this stupid family.  They wont let me go out and hang and feel real air and freedom but strap me in this damn house.  Acting like I have a ton of things I can do.  HELLO !! IM NOT A FUCKIN KID ANYMORE !! IM SIXTEEN ALMOST LEGAL 2 FUCK !!! OMG ... I hate it here.  2 years really isn't that much of a difference.
