      Well I talked to Eric and he said he didn't tell Erin anything, but he does like me.  So that's good.  Although, he just wants to be 'single' for awhile.  Oh well.. we're still friends, and that's awesome!  I was just starting to come out of my head, but I thnik I'm gonna go back in for awhile....  ~Can't blame a girl for trying...

      While I was reading other friends' blogs that I realized to just be myself... I really don't think I've ever done that before, not in the 14-almost 15- years that I've been alive.  It's hard to imagine, I know, but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me, not trying to, how to be myself.  So here it goes:  I like a guy, named Eric and supposebly he likes me back the same way-according to Erin.  I just hope he didn't lie and was telling the truth... I've been hurt and I don't want to be hurt again.  I'll post tomorrow. ~Paranoia
