      Today I went to Wal-Mart around 7am before mexicans came around. To quote: "the swap meet is the mexican church and wal-mart is there park for joyment." Anyways i had to buy some CD-R discs so i can put all my albums i downloaded into my collection (34). Then i bought EA Sports Collection for my pc, it has games from 2003, Madden, Tiger Woods, Nascar, NHL and MVP. Its pretty good for a reasonable price of $19.98. On our way back, my dad let drive and i did one hell of a job. I have a '97 honda accord waiting for me on my drive way. Im waiting to turn 16 and get my permit. I almost ran over a cat. :(  Then I stood home, i cleaned up around the house and played my new PC games. Then around 3 o'clock got ready to go to the movies with my mom, her husband and my grandma. I went to go see 'The Day After Tomorrow' at the dollar theater. That was a good movie, pissed me off how the main characters always end up leaving. They are always the smartest. If i made a movie the main characters would die. In fact im writing a movie, called 'An American Revolution'. Due date 8th of Jan 2005. Its a propaganda film. Then went to go eat, then now im home. I'll be online for 30minutes then i'll get off to play a game then watch tv. Then its bed time.  Tomorrow i go back to school to battle the Kern High School District to let me play for the football team. Nonsense, need a 2.0 to play, I had a 2.9 and their telling me i have a 1.9. Its bunch of horse feathers. Anyways, i'll update this tomorrow or whenever.  Peace..  *currently listening to: Death Cab For Cutie - Champagne From A Paper Cup*

      Like for example today, I was making a website for my friend and his business. Well I had it perfectly the way I wanted, I clicked saved.... and it doesn't work! I clicked it like 4 times and my computer ends up getting frozen. The site got messed up, and I couldn't log in it. I wasted nearly 2 hours of my morning for what?? Nothing! I was gonna get $50 for this too. Eh, I didn't do anything today anyway. All I did was watch TV and clean outside.  I seen the movie Barbershop today on HBO, I thought it was funny. I made me laugh alittle bit. Then watched the Olympics for awhile, now I'm watching Everybody Loves Raymond... now I'm waiting for Seinfeld too come. Can't wait for the DVD! Seasons 1-3!! I might not buy it, my parents might get for me during Christmas.  theLVeffect is out....

       Welcome to my blogspot. This is like my personal journal or something which is awesome. So it's like im not a little girl keepin a journal book in my room hidden under my bed. I could talk about my day and say shit about people and nobody would know... well some people will. This is better than my other site http://apextheory.8m.com because i never wanted to update it. I'm gonna try and keep this up and work with it, but i'll end up forgetting about it or just get lazy about it. Well i have things to do and i'll update it later about my day. Peace.
