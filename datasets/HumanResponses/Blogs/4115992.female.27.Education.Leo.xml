      Below is a recap of one of the most embarassing experiences of my life in Chile.  It was the first week in July.  I had just moved into my new pension across from the University of Concepcion.  This pension is occupied by mostly U students but a couple of workers too, aproximately 8 Chilean men and 2 Chilean women.  I was pretty excited to be changing locations, as my previous pension was exteremley small.  I packed up my things and went four blocks down the street.  I began to unpack and noticed that a bit of dirt had collected in the bottom of my hiking backpack because my shoes were packed there.  I went out to my private balcony (did I mention that my room has a private balcony?) and shook the dirt out into the front yard.  Not thinking anything of it I went along my merry way.  The next day (The 4th of July) I woke up late and was getting ready to go to an asado (bbq).  I couldn't find my underwear, but I hadn't finished unpacking so I wasn't too worried about it.  As I was leaving, one of my new housemates, Magda, a translation student, stopped me and said, "Allison, I'm not positive, but I think your underwear is out on the front yard."  With a sunken stomach and a dropped jaw, I realized that all of my underwear was packed into the long, nearly invisible pocket inside my backpack.  As I was removing the dirt, I had sprinkled about 25 pairs of my underwear all over the front yard.  Not only that, but they had been laying there for just over 24 hours, just long enough for all of my roommates to enjoy the view.  What a way to welcome myself to the house.

      Okay, I was told that this was a better way to keep you folks informed about my life in Chile.  So here goes.  This week offically marks the 5 month point of me living in Chile.  It also marks tthe 27th year of me living in general.  I had a great party on Saturday night.  I rented out a little bar close to my house for the night named Bacos.  About 50 students, friends and co-workers came to celebrate with me.  I had a really good time.  Then Sunday rolled around and I got a little depressed.  It was sad to be alone on my birthday (plus I had a pretty wicked hangover).  I guess I am better now.  Some of my students got together and bought me a heater for my bedroom, so at least my constant state of freezing has subsided.  Currently, I am looking for an apartment to live in.  My pension is okay but I prefer cooking for myself.  My Chilean friends tell me that this place is too expensive.  Enough fo now...until next time.
