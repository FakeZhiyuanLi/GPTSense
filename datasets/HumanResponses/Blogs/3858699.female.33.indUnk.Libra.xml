      These kind of posts are boring, but here are some interesting things I found online this week:   urlLink Geek comedy by Ernie Cline  - this might be a little old, but it's the first I stumbled across it and it's hilarious!   urlLink There are going to be credentialed bloggers at both the Democratic and Republican conventions this year  - i think that's pretty freakin' amazing and really demostrates the power and potential of the web. I wonder if blogging will be the same, though. How easy will it be to "break into" blogging now? Is there a finite audience?   urlLink A popular blog turns out to be fiction  - I never read this blog, but I find this story incredibly interesting. Did this man cross the line by pretending to be something that he's not (iow, a 28yo lesbian rape survivor)? The act of making up a character online wasn't wrong. As someone who believes in the freedom the 'net provides, I defend his right to create something completely fictional and pass it off as real. However, he shouldn't have chatted one on one with people, especially rape survivors, and pretended to by something he's not. That's crossing the line.  enjoy :)

      As some of you know, this blog used to exist as a stand alone website at www.sassygeek.com. Well, thanks to my hosting service, that was a miserable failure. Every time I tried to update the site, the hosting service would mess up and I'd lose access to my admin site or they would do something like decide to delete my database.  So, in a very un-geeklike manner, I gave up. I surrender! I attempted to be a geek, but the truth is...I'm still a geek groupie. What is a geek groupie? A geek groupie is someone who knows enough about computers to work on them and with them, but would rather not. A geek groupie is a person who loves to learn about geekie pursuits, but doesn't want to apply them. A geek groupie is someone who goes a little weak in the knees when a geek starts spewing technobabble. A geek groupie loves technology as much as a geek, but would rather listen to a geek talk about building a computer than build one themselves.  That's me.   In this blog I'm going to write about and comment on internet culture and communications. I've been online since 1993 (although the first time I saw the internet was 1991) and so I've watched the medium grow and change from the wild west frontier to...the wild west frontier! The way in which people interact online and how that spreads into the real world is endlessly fascinating. As someone who lived the first 20 years of my life without the interenet and the next 13 immersed in it, I'd like to think I have a unique perspective.   And so, like millions of others, I'm sending my thoughts out into the internet ether, hoping to find an audience. Hope you like it here and link me if you approve.  Thanks!
