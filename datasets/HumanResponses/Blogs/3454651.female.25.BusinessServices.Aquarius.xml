        I can not believe it, today May 25th and here in lovely Des Moines, Iowa we did not receive any rain!  Its a freakin miracle!  This past weekend was a nightmare here.  Friday and Saturday was super hot and humid oh and did I mention over a hundred tornadoes all around!  Rain, rain and more rain, along with lots of hail!  Anyways enough with the weather crap onto what makes me a Drama Queen?    There is one thing that has ticked me off for the past week now and it has to do with one of the area grocery stores here in Des Moines.  The grocery store that I'm bitching about is employee owned and is pretty much all over the Midwest.  I'm not going to say its name, but if you know who I'm talking about then wonderful!  If you don't know who I'm talking about, then just read on.  It first started last Wednesday, when I to place an order for flowers to be sent to a co-work of mine who's father had just passed away.  The dumb high schooler who was working behind the counter was a real "Peach" to work with, let me just tell you that right now!  Its always pleasant to hear an employee go to you, "Did you need something?" in that oh so pleasant voice of hers!  I was there to spend a lot of money on flowers and this is how I'm treated?  Oh I forgot I'm in the "Country Club" area of West Des Moines, where kids really don't have to work, because "Daddy" will give me money!  That's another rant for later!  I told her, they need to be sent to a small town in Minnesota and all I had was an address minus the zip code.  Little Priss coped an attitude with me about not having "the zip code!"  She ever so nicely asked me, "Is there some you can call to get this?  Because, I need it that's the way we send the order."  Well, you know I would be more then happy to do that for anyone, but not for a snotty teenager who kept tapping her fingers while I was on my cell phone trying to find a zip code for her.  If she was really smart she could of walked her sorry ass up to customer service, where in the postal express area is a book that has zip codes for all cities and towns in the US!  She was a peach to deal with I so want everyone to go there and buy your flowers for this place!     My other issue with this grocery store has to do with their dry cleaning service.  Sunday, I took two of my new Ralph Lauren shirts in, to be dry cleaned.  They should of been back yesterday, but oh no, they now can't seem to find my two shirts.  The girl in dry cleaning was like, "they might have put them in with some one else's, but I hope I can find them for you!"  Just Wonderful!  I love this store!    Anyways.....         I'm normally not this bad but this place is just so bad!         Tomorrow I will enlighten you about my Marketing Guy at work!

           Today, is a warm and sunny, a perfect day to go to the pool like I normally do in the summer.  But, oh no not today, I have no motivation to do anything or go anywhere.  Instead, I'm washing clothes and I went and washed my jeep and vacuumed it.  Boy do I live an exciting life!        My only high light of this weekend was yesterday morning when getting ready to go to the Des Moines Downtown Farmers Market with my mom.  I was in my room getting things ready such as what I was going to wear stuff like that.  When dumb ass here tripped over her flip flops and my toe next to the baby one got caught and I fell onto my bed.  I was in pain but walked it off then went on to take my shower.  When I got out an hour later from my shower my toe was purple, black, and blue and very sore. Yes, indeed I broke that toe again doing something very stupid! Let me tell you how hard it is to walk in flip flops when its raining?  Its not easy at all!     That's all I have to say today, very boring I know but its Sunday a day of rest!       Well off to surfing the web to find another job!        Encase, Jess reads this Happy One Year anniversary Tomorrow!    Bye for now Peaches!

      There should be some law that forbids stupid people from spawn offspring!  All I'm asking for is people to have common sense, is that so hard to ask for?  When visiting the lovely city of Des Moines, you will find loads of people that think the world stops just for them!  West Des Moines, where I live is a perfect spot to look for these so called "wan be rich" who thinks everyone they pass should stop and look at them!  I'm sorry but all they are is NEW MONEY!  Which most of the time means they have no class or common sense! The New Rich in West Des Moines, like to show off their money with the cars they don't buy but lease and the giant houses they own in the Country Club, but with very little furniture in them.  I really don't care if you drive down the street driving your giant hammer H20, here in Iowa.  What I would like to know is what giant mountain or desert are you planning on driving through here in Iowa?  In most cities, such as Los Angles, Chicago, Denver, and Minneapolis, there are a group of people you can really afford to buy these expensive luxury cars like a hammer or jag, but not here in Des Moines, Iowa!  I know I can count on one hand a very very small group of Iowans who can afford to purchase these expansive material things.  One these Iowans in my dream is my future husband, his name is Robert Gallery, who this fall who can watch him play for the Oakland Raiders!      West Des Moines, is truly a very nice area to live in.  I do really love living on this part of town, but some of my "neighbors" need to get a brain along with giving their kids one too!  I was raised by my mom and grandma, so I didn't have an easy childhood, like most of these spoiled brats do here!  Yes, I too was spoiled but I was the only grandchild.  Even though I was spoiled all through my childhood, I was also told to get a job at 16 and work hard at it regardless of what it was.  I worked hard and still do for that paycheck.  Kids here they "work" but not really, because they know Daddy will give me money regardless if "I work or not."  Another thing is kids have no discipline!  Giving a child "time out" does not work!  Timmy you do that again you get a time out!  What does that teach a child?  I'm sorry, but if I acted up I got one warning if that even, but I got the back of my mom's hand on the back of my butt.  But, God for bid now we can't do that, because people will say that's child abuse!  I'm sorry but spanking your child who misbehaves is not child abuse.  If you spank so hard that your child comes out of his shoes or leaves a hand print on the child's butt, then yes that is child abuse.  Another thing during my summer vacation from College I use to work at Target, I hated hearing kids screaming to get their way and having the parent say, "Now Susie, if you keep this up we are going home!"  You know darn well, Susie wants to go home and not be out shopping.  Children need discipline and spanking works.  By God, I learned not to push my mom's buttons, or the fear of God would be shown.       I think its fine to spoil your kids to extent but teach them manners and working at a minimum wage job while in school teaches them to value the paycheck that they are working for.        Also, give them a work ethic.  Some of the people I work with, who are my age don't have that.  They come and go whenever they want and for some odd reason get ahead at ING.  I work my ass off, I work tons of overtime and yet the only one who says thank you to me for doing this is my Senior Coordinator.  My head boss, her office is right next to my desk, I very rarely her, "Thank you, Whitney for all you hard work."  My normal working hours are from 8-5,  I get to work about 7:15 or 7:30 and stay until 5:30 or later, for some reason my services are never rewarded.  I guess from watching other coworkers of mine at ING, I should come in late and leave for a two hour lunch, then maybe call in a day after my birthday  saying I can't come in cause I have a hangover.  But if my boss was a man I should just start going out with him and be put on all of our departments committees, just because I'm screwing the boss!        I thought when working for any major company that its frowned on for sleeping with the boss?  One would thing this was not acceptable but who am I?  My head boss for my department is very loud!  Granted my voice does carry and I'm well aware of that, but when your boss walks so loud that it sounds like a heard of elephants stampeding around 3rd floor that you kind of wonder.  I have never had a boss that knew absolutely nothing about what I do in her department.  She is more worried about her and the life side of our department then anything else! When she steps off the elevator she screams "Chuck!" She sends everyone in my group e-mails saying "Please keep your voices down and cut down the socializing!"  I'm sorry you point one figure at me there are three pointing right back at you!  She sends us e-mails at 3 in the morning!  She always looks like she pissed of at the world, and she loves to flirt with every guy on our floor!  No wonder why she still isn't married or has a boy friend she intimidates everyone!  She hates getting phone calls from the agents out in the field who may have issues that I myself can not answer or can but they don't like my answer to give them.  Well recently I received a phone call from an agent out in California who wished to speak with my head boss, not knowing that she was standing near my desk, I told the agent that she was in a meeting and advised him to leave a message in her phone mail box.  Before the agent could say another word, you hear Amy say, "Way to go Whitney, great thinking to tell the agent that I'm in a meeting!"  Amy as a loud voice and the agent heard her scream that in the background.  So thank God I'm a PR major when the agent said to me, "Yes, I guess I will leave her a massage if she is in a so-called meeting."  I was like yes sir she is indeed in a meeting.       Until, next time when I feel like venting yet again!
