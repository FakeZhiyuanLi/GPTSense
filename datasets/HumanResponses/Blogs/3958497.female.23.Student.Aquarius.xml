      so i transplanted willy the wimp outside today.now all i can do is pray that he is a sHe and that she's not a wimp but actually a nasty ass bitch afterall.. only time will tell tho..wouldnt it just be my luck tho (cause im  born under a bad sign..) that when i dO want a female-a lady:)-i get a male.. bleck, i have to work today.-i hope this weekend flies.my rents are FiNally gone and all i want to do is party.cant get it out of my system, it's in my vaIns, in my blood, in my bones, in my dna. i think it's just really ways of coping with life's let downs. i mean, id party to celebrate too (that they are gone!) but like, on the other hand, my grandpa is about to die.this is my dad's dad.right after he had brain surgery, there were complications-swelling, and he wouldnt eat, would throw everything up he did eat.his sugar was 400.but then he seemed to recover, and when this 80 year old german irish pappy pinched the nurse's ass (in today's day and age of lawsuits, this just cracks me up!), everyone thought he'd be ok. but now, now, he's gotten worse.he's not eating at all, all he wants to do is sleep, and when he does wake up, he just sits and stares. not enough just to stand and stare..is it only a dream there will be no more turning away?  sigh. maybe it's time for him to go home.maybe danny boy(my unc who died abruptly last yr)&nbsp;is calling him home.  &nbsp;

       tonight .haha.yeah fucking right.that's like smokey sayin in&nbsp; friday  he's goin to rehab..rehab's for quitters, yo,  and you know this maaaaaaan  naw, i do like the song,and&nbsp;im anxious to hear the&nbsp; (all of the) new linkin park album -but i just really hope this album isnt played out as much as the last.fucking a, the last one got old a few months after it was released..the guys can jam, certainly, but damn, they are another boy band. i mean, REAL TALENT is writing yer own shit, meeting on yer own, all that.  i have no doubt that my friend's band-ao-art official-is going to make it big. their sound is like nothing ever before.it is THE best shit that i have heard.the stuff on the radio seems liek crap compared to them.i mean, matt's guitar riffs compare to stevie ray, hendrix,&nbsp;sublime,and system..so as if&nbsp;we all couldnt just listen to matt's melodies all night long..then---&nbsp;ray comes along on lead mic spitting&nbsp;out the lyrics at times, yet at others, taking it down a notch (haha.ive been watching emeril) to a slower  going to ca- ish pace.i dunno.then the fucking drummer jeff-he's just hauling ass, keepin them all in line, and&nbsp;finally there is dave&nbsp;on bass rockin out the place-to all the shit that has happened, all the shit to come.&nbsp;the final point that i want to make about my friend's band is that their lyrics are&nbsp;soooo meaningful and well written. ray has been writing his own geee-tar riffs and poetry&nbsp; for yeeeeeaaars-and it's just straight up. i mean, it's stuff that anyone could identify with. but not any of that generic rhyming shit -just music, in the blue, in the bliss. they are def a mix of blues, classics, and harder shit (but nothing like slayerish shit-hellllllllllll no!).words can even describe how fucking good they are.one day, yall will be hearing them on the radio. i think this will really happen when waiting for never starts to play with ao. cause waiting for never has the connections(the osbornes, korn, et al) , and ao has the..well..umm..talent.:) .sublime's on now:long beach, style :) god, i miss calie. miss the west coast in gen.the east wore itself out a long time ago.it's time for a change..maybe until i can get back out west ill have to dye my hair something new..cause&nbsp;god knows i dont have money for any new tats yet..unless i can get a discount cause that lesbian chicka works at the parlor?hmm..have to check that out! oh, btw, i have decided to not go that route(bicurious stuff).listening to madonna made me realize it would just be a  substitute for love.  i already have enough substitutes.

      so i finally stared  learning gap . i have not read a book with this much enthusiasm and vigor since i cant remember when..perhaps senior year and  mere christianity ? i think. it just gives me&nbsp;such a renewed sense of activism and desire to teach. i would LOVEEEE to reform america-in any way i can..i would LOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEE to teach the same kids for 2-3 years like they do in elementary schools in e asia. i dont think anything would make me happier than to start teaching kids at age 3 or 4 for 2,3, hell, even 4 years.instill in them the asian principles that teachers/society/family neglected to teach me until i had to find out on my own the hard way.

      as always, music is such a HUGe part of my day.im unsettled without it. but it's not jUSt mindlessly zoning out to a song, it's also the meaning, the memory, the mental images created with music. earlier in the day, i heard madonna.gosh, did she put out some awesome music.still does, but often her older stuff was the best.  ray of light ,however, is very inspirational: a diff madonna twist on life: a grown, wiser madonna. and so, most of the ppl who would be reading this-my palz(lol!)-  i miss you...like the deserts miss the rain... for real dawggggsss,, yall dont even know.. so today was mic jager's 61st.heard  cant get no satisfaction  and it instantly brought a smile to my face on the drive home from work. that should be the american anthem because isnt it inherently in us all to be dissatisfied even when we've achieved better, more, the best? so yeah,&nbsp; i cant get no satisfaction .. i cant get no  good boy action.. cause i try..and i try..and i try..(im on a losing streak )...maybe, if im lucky, one day i will meet a nice guy. but i guess there's somewhat of a discrepancy between my wants/needs and reality because im generally a girl by day, a bad girl by night. :) whatev........  &nbsp;

      yabba dabble doobie doo  isnt it ironic that the dreams we have as KIDs are often rarely fulfilled in reality? when we are young&nbsp;but prolly the most true to ourselves, the least corrupted, the least worldly: least unhappy/overweight/addicted/stressed/self centered, we make some loafy goal. (duh). i used to want to be a scientist so i could find a cure for aids.i used to want to be a vet so i could work with animals all day and help them.animals&nbsp;i can handle. they are not only trainable, but&nbsp;above all-loyal. if we could only expect a 1/4 of the faithfulness animals&nbsp;exhibit in ourselves-a breed supposedly so much higher, so much better off.&nbsp;(that was random tangent!)no, instead we lose ourselves to everything but nothing at all. we lose ourselves to life..[t0] big televisions, washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin can openers.[we choose] sitting on the couch watching mind numbing, spirit crushing...shows....which is not to be ignored..but we make&nbsp;it our ends. we ignore/neglect&nbsp;more than we should&nbsp;the obvious stuff-the stuff that's free-love/trust/loyality(i dont know if that is a word, but in this context it will be! ;) ). we become religious to this world-relig: to worship-we worship this world/money/power/fame.meanwhile, our bodies are crying out for help. the signs are apparent-fatigue, depression, anxiety, all that shit-and instead of listening, we keep running the hamster's wheel, the ferris wheel of lights as we ride the ride alone or with others-doestn matter-in the man's dream-we are alone.we're american, no 1 proud fast&nbsp;food nation, with our bellys protruding from our belt buckles as we shove more french fries in our mouth. there was a time when our fat, arrogant nation emphasized the individual=fostering his needs/rights/unique talents. (dewey, et al.)these concepts were lost with ritalin, longer school days, less recess for kids, less parental rights, more&nbsp;psychoactive drugs for kids to numb/mask the pain, crappier lower paid teachers- local govt is too busy pumping money into worthless causes like the war on drugs or overpaid govt officials, less parental responsibilty for familial ties-work longer and harder to make more to make more to make more to spend less time with the family that you are supposedly making all this money for-to foster their growth.instead you foster their material dEsire.you beget kids that want it all.and it's never good enough. their is that hole that all the belongings in the world dont fill. and so the kids stumble and fall, meander here there either chasing this stupid fucking neverending wheel or they try to find other reasons for life.(cause you know how easy this is being a youth!)stumble,fall, stumble, fall. and one day if they are lucky, they fuck up, wake up, rise up.otherwise, they continue on the same path, wondering why they cant be like all the ppl they see below, seemingly soooo happy, why they cant have more power/money/prestige, why they cant have better kids cause they have really have invested sooo much, to omuch, for the kids to make a mistake like they did! heaven forbid!and the kids, meanwhile, are stumbling regardless of weather they see it or not. they are kids, and no one is perfect,, even the parent instilling the so called worthy values. not to deny the ethic of work, but there is more than life.not to deny stability, cause it's worth gold. but there are other ways to have reliablity, stablity, and wholeness than the the standard route.i cant even remember who wrote it-some famous poet-said something about the less beaten path and how he's so glad to have taken it. it's true.we lose it when we get old. we want to fit in, to be just like everyone else-so we can build our esteem-when all along we never realize that esteem isnt build like that-it is build from within, from above. we will nEVer be whole or complete until we look elsewhere:something more, something greater&nbsp;and start to replay and live our dreams of past.&nbsp; haha.i dont think my thoughts flowed very well, but i dont think they currently are supposed to flow, just fly, thx.

      well, this summertime seems to be coming around..with shit around here to do but par-tay ;), im glad the keggers are finally goin on.. last night was a lil crazy, but im sure the kid will be ok. i was drunk and just so close to what happened, i&nbsp; freaked the fuck out when his eyes rolled back into his head and then shortly after he started vomiting..but when i left, he was in the hands of an rn at the party, so im sure he'll be ok..fucking a, he'll live. it was weird last night on another acct tho, too. i hung out all night long with this lesbian chick i met at a diff party-just cause she's really nice and we have repetoire.well, i think she may like me but im not sure.and then it got me thinking.do lesbians have a lot of female friends they are NOT interested in? then my mind started wandering off on a diff trail..i started wondering-what if she dOes like you(cause i really think she does)?&nbsp; i mean, regardless, i want to be her friend, but maybe she could help me explore my bicUrious nature, too.i know it's 'wrong' and all, but i really wonder what it would be like. im just torn bc what if i went that route and i liked it? then what? &nbsp;isnt my life hard enough?&nbsp;&nbsp;doesnt it mainly happen cause ppl dont have good luck with the opposite sex and so they give up on heteosexual relations?i havent had good luck with ken's or bens or steve's or tim's or jim's..haha...like, im afraid id get sucked into that lifestyle cause im nieve and willing&nbsp;on one hand, but&nbsp;then on the other-&nbsp;i AM&nbsp;attracted to guys, there's no doubt about that :) iwant a family someday.i want a baby.i want a pseudo-traditional household, me raising&nbsp;the kids/cooking/cleaning/all that shit i love. but&nbsp;like, she's&nbsp; sweet and im curious...and oh so nieve.

       ive cried a river of tears from the pain..i try to dance with what life has to hand me: my partner's been pleasure, my partner's been pain..there are days when i swear i can fly like the eagle..and all desperate hours that nobody sees..my arms stretched&nbsp; triumphant on top of the mountain..or my head in my hands, down on my knees.. sometimes it a bitch   ,       sometimes it's&nbsp;a breeze..sometimes love's blind, and sometimes it sees..sometimes it's roses..sometimes it's weeds..sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes:it's a breeze..   ive crossed in darkness and come out with treasure..ive laid down with love, but ive woke up with lies..what's it all worth only the heart can measure..it's not what's in the mirror but  what's left inside.. sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze..sometimes love;s blind and sometimes it sees..sometimes it's roses..sometimes it's weeds................you get what you want, but it's-not what you&nbsp; neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed...sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze...you gotta take it as it comes..sometimes it dont come easy................................................... stevie, a woman of my own heart i swear..before i was even into her music, but when i was facing the same demons, i would write all sorts of poetry. years later when i become a fan of this  big time rock and roll star , i realized-some of our lyrics, some of our poetry, was the same. gosh, if this lady ever tour again-hell if fleetwood mac ever tours again-im there :)

      i just had to comment on my posts. so i was reviewing all i had written, it's very cathartic to write, ya know, and so im lookin at all the headings..hell, this that, pain blah blah blah and then blueberry coffee cake.how random. but&nbsp;i guess what me..wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :) im thinking how much bullshit has happened this night, hwo fucking stupid most/all of it was, but im learning..with everything, im learning. and as i looked at my dad tonight, i realized how arrogant, self centered, mean, impulsive, childish, violent, unforgiving,hurtful, stubborn&nbsp;is he. i realized i dont want a man anything like him-if im someday lucky-i will meet a man like my bro pat cause patrick is least like my dad of all of us.. but ironically-and that bastard freud was soo right-so many of the ASSHOLES that i have met are sooo much like my dad in soo many ways-self centered, lying, manipulative, stubborn, unforgiving, childish..i would meet guys that seemed soo unlike him just cause fishing and hunting werent their entire life-and i would meet them and thiink  great! someone to take me away from home, away from my asshole dad.. but then meanwhile i come to find out they are just like him with a devil's disguise. the same disguise that my dad wore courting my dad.but see, in many ways, im glad i slept with all those assholes early on.caus emaybe if i made them reALly court me, maybe if i made them wait, then NOt ONLY would i have become more attached, and so would have they-but also-more time would have been spent pursuing LIES.and so, it's funny how nieve one can be.so nieve.so childlike.

      i know i had told michelle and becky, if not others, i would give them the old betty crocker recipe.here it is.easy as heck to make! ~preheat oven to 375. ~grease and flour a square pan-9X9X1 3/4 " (or just whatever smaller pan you may have).. ~mix* 3/4 c sugar,  *1/4 c soft shortening(leave it on the counter with the other ingredients for advance prep), and *one egg together thoroughly.stir in &nbsp;*1/2 c milk. measure  *1 1/2 c flour by dip-level-pour method or by sifting. blend all these dry ingredients-flour,  *2 t baking powder, and  *1/2 t salt.&nbsp;stir in. FiNallY *add however many  blueberries you so desire-1/2 c -1 c ish ;). (this recipe doesnt originally call for blueberries, but my family has been adding our own homegrown blueberries for years and it's really good with them).&nbsp; spread batter in pan. sprinkle with topping-1/2 c packed brown sugar mixed with  1 1/2 t cinnamon.&nbsp; *&nbsp;bake 25-35 min or until toothpick poked into center comes out clean. serve warm (or cold!) with butter/icecream :) -my mom likes to double this batch to make it worth her time..it's amazing how quick one batch of this stuff goes..barely, if not, enough to feed a family for breakfast.

      so i found out today that my grandpa-who went in for brain surgery-is worse off after his surgery than before. there were complications with putting whatever stint in his brain for the water retention and so now his brain is swelling. he cant talk, move, cant do a damn thing. i feel bad for my grandpa, and i wish he'd either get better or just quickly pass. id miss him, but death is a part of life. we all live, we all die: it's inevitable. but who i especially feel bad for is my grandma. she's 2 years younger than him-77-but if he dies,i really think she will die of a broken heart. they've had a long, rocky marriage, but she didnt make it this far with her polish pride to take it sitting down.she's a fighter, louise: the warrior. and so, she's blaming herself for his surgery.nothing anyone can say will ease her mind; she's made it up that she is the one to blame. sooo yeah-it sucks. and im a fucking bitch-la de fucking da. between work, family, and school, i think im going insane in the membrane. plus, i miss my friends. i see some ok fairweather friends now and then, but rarely do i see my good friends. hell, i barely know who they are nowadays. i barely know who i am anymore.

       music is my aeroplane..that motherfucker's always spiked with pain .yes, yes, rhcp now; sirius rules...  &nbsp;maaan, i wish i was seeing the cure next week.(that was random but)&nbsp;i think if i dont have to work and my parents have left for canada, then&nbsp; i may just go down and party in the parking lot. sounds like a good enough idea, right? without my truck, tho-it would be lonely..gosh, i miss that little bitch at times..  so yeah, im prolly technically bipolar, of course, but in some ways: it's fun. i wouldnt appreciate the highs as much without the lows. i wouldnt have the genius without the lows.i wouldnt have the sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer pleasure w ithout the highs.so in some messed way, it all turns in my favoUr :)  i guess im happy i dont have to work til 1 tomorrow/plus, my car has been in the shop since wed, but i should have it either tomorrow or sat..finally, i thought my parents were leaving in a week for canada, but i think it should be less than that! hell yeah!  freeeeeeeeeeeedom..yeah .  it's not even that i throw wild parties-despite my mom's paranoia that i will.im not even really interested in doing that. naw, i might go to a couple parties and not have to worry about curfew, i might have over ppl i normally wouldnt, i might smoke in the house, burn incense, play loud music, or sleep in til 2. the point is that i am under no constraints: none of their bUllshitty.  &nbsp;so the title- i guess&nbsp; it's appropriate for this week, for this life. imean, i wouldnt really have it any other way. as i read on the back of&nbsp;my friend's marines'&nbsp;shirt- pain is weakness leaving the body. if we didnt have pain, misery, we wouldnt becOme.    i am  becoming.stronger.wiser.bolder.  more creative/empathetic/honest/REAl..i am becoming a better version of me because of all the bullshit, the abuse, the lies, the assholes.&nbsp;all they do is make me stronger.&nbsp; .&nbsp;..the run arounds only&nbsp; make me step down one notch - taken back by their lies when i thought them true-fucking REAL. but after i get off my knees, after i bandage my skinned shins, i rise ten notches above them all.fuckin a, ten notches. and they will be left flabergasted, wondering why they never won the rat race when they did everything they were supposed to and never found happiness.all the while, i was sitting on the sidelines, watching them meaninglessly stagger toward some imaginary line that never even fucking existed.it was made by the man, big brother, and they were too caught up in their own lies to take a look inside and realize all they had done and wasted.

      last night scared me. it really did. i guess i have such a blind melon, when the truth does come, it pierces me like a serated blade.(yeah yeahi cant spell). in a way, i like being oblivious, but i also like to know the truth. i want to be able to consciously reject, deny, or in general suppress the truth IF i would like to do so, but&nbsp;i do NOT like being kept in the dark. ive been in the dark for too long. sleep&nbsp;provided little rest, comfort to me. i wouldnt doubt whatsoever that the demons that gather there-elm street extension (real life version),- the demon that is cursing that household has perhaps clung onto&nbsp;me in the process. i&nbsp;know how crazy it sounds. but like, i believe in angels, i knOw they exist, and so conversly their&nbsp;opposite must exist, too. &nbsp;i had nightmares all night, and woke up this morning -clueless as to what was happening but on&nbsp;the verge of tears. i do not feel even slightly rested. i feel completely run down. i think that if there is an evil spirit down there-he obviously sees me as the threat that i am to his evil force. evil is always intimidated by goodness, and either evil wins, or it cowers and runs liek hell.. i dunno. i cant help but think of the past. i can help but think that it wasnt until jessica's dad killed himself that all of us ever really got into the occult. hell, we were just kids wanting our friend to be able to talk to her dad, to tell her dad she still loved him. but the ouijia board couldnt provide us with what we sought-how could it? the closing question we asked him-where he was at-it told us the bleak reality-hell. and so, it wasnt for a couple years that i got more into occult. i mean, i never practiced black magic-at least not intentionally-&nbsp;but i know when i started drinkingin 7th grade&nbsp;but before the drugs in 8th grade i read the necronomicon. my friend gave it to me telling me how few were in print, how powerful it was, how to not lend it to anyone else. i doubted what she said, but being he stupid kid that i was (just like with acid) i had to test everything on my own. (so people say looking into your pupils while tripping makes you insane? well well well..lemme try! ok, that is off the point..let me..find..it.aha!)i tried incantations of this ancient book the dead, the book of satan.:( i would only use&nbsp;whatever ingredients i could get my&nbsp;hands on&nbsp;1/4-1/2 of what was required.&nbsp; i attemped to summon some ancient thing. i dont know what the hell i was thinking. but if memory serves me correctly, it was shortly after my dabblings in this occult that i got out of school suspension, became a pill fiend, and then wound up in rehab. it's haunting me..it's haunting me... now as i continue to dig up my past, i recall ordering a book on shamanism over the net. the dude accidently sent me a calendar on magic before he sent me the book.he told me to keep it. thinking it was harmless enough, i kept it up all school year long. i really liked the pictures. soon, i cut them out and hung them on my closet. SO is it just coinsidence that this year was the WORST YEAR OF MY ENTIRE LIFE or was it that-by opening my psyche to magical concepts-even if white-wiccan-it also opened&nbsp;ME up to tons of bad stuff, too. :(..spirits eagerly waiting on the otherside, in the netherworld, to prance on anyone willing, waiting. so now&nbsp;i am left to wonder if it is the tormented soul of charles roberts haunting the fenstemakers. it could easily be. i guess it could easily be any demon, tho, too. when tonya was living there, she would ask me to join her cult. id always say no, that i wasnt into drinking blood and shit. at the time, i think she wanted it to be white magic, which i was also into at the time. but she got more than she bargained for-im sure-it turned into black magic. i never wanted to drink blood. i always refused to and always NIEVELY shrugged it off when matt/dave/andrew t old me that was the 411.i secretly hoped it reaLLy wasnt happening. and now? now, i will never know what really happened. all i know is that ihave this overwhelming feeling that i must help them. that i cant let them flounder alone, with tempation all around them. perhaps that house iS the gateway into hell. perhaps&nbsp;i lost my soul a long time ago and now im doing my best to reclaim it.

      family and schooling so my morning started out by my dad waking me up at 8 to tell me the tv doesnt work.grumbling, i go back to bed; i dont give a fuck about tv (ok, ok, so maybe queer eye for a straight guy ,sex and the city,simpsons, or south park, but that's mostly it&nbsp;and i have a tv of my own anyway) so then i finally wake up an hour later, and i take a bath. he comes in and&nbsp;asks me why the hell would i take a bath (i only havent showered in a day), starts bitching about why would i burn a candle? hello-dickhead-relaxation-which he fucking damn near ruined! so around 11ish, i feel relieved( freeeeeeeeeedoomm)  to leave and tak e a drive to&nbsp;butler to get registered for my 2nd to last class for my BA. i get their 50 min later, and their fucking computers were down; i could only register in person. soo, tomorrow idrive back down there again because the weiners dont think of making backup paper copies.grrrr...whil im on&nbsp;bc3, this class should be interesting. at grove city, i social loafed as much as possible-and it was possible quite often with the overachieving grover faggots. but like, im not gonna wanna loaf here even&nbsp;IF i can. ive seen the dumbasses that go this school, and damn! this means im gonna have to do some work,  shit damn motherfucker!   then i get home and work tells me im scheduled for 40 hrs next week-keeewwwl-but then only 13ish the next week. imean, wtf? i need reliable hours, thank you.all i wanted was to work 50-60 per week this summer, and im getting nothing close. i guess you reap what you sow-in that i fucked around for so long not putting in applications-and now im paying the consequences. so tonight, tonight, i will do anYthing to get me out of this house. ANything. i think im gonna go visit my friend with the chinchillas,igunanas, fish, and lizards.i always feel like im in a jungle when i visit his place-all the plants and animals crawling around:) maybe watch the hobbit...anywho, for as much as i bitch, nevertheless all i want is  PeAcE

      all i have to say is we are screwed if kerry wins-goodbye gun rights! a friend was just telling me that she heard of ppl who, while in the army, would be murdered by other soldiers if they did not follow order and kill every man, woman, and child. of course, i would tell someone to go to hell if they told me to kill a child-but possibly even if they tried to order me to kill someone not apparently armed. id like to take a risk of dying, thank you, verses killing someone innocent. and of course, i know bush is pres now. but like, i just think the more control aNY one of us gives to the govt, the MORE they will want to take. and if we dont want to let them take it, they will take it by coersion, by force. if we let them take our&nbsp;hand guns then next it will be our semiautomatic&nbsp;rifles. ive hunted for years, and not only are semiautomatic easier to shoot and clean, but they are also nicer to load..&nbsp; the current debate on gun rights is about worthless as the war on drugs. just give it up, already! ppl will get guns, drugs, or sex one way or another, so regardless of our effort-our fucking tax monies-there will always be the&nbsp; market. and as long as their is the market, there will be aprovider.simple enough.how about instead of pointing the fingers at inanimate weapons, we start to rather look at the living breathing tenure teaching bullshit? im not meaning to imply that i have all the answers, nor am i implying&nbsp; that i think bush is wonderful. i think the revenge he instilled in americans is a terrible thing. fear/hated of foreigners has gotten so bad it makes me ashamed at times to be a local.esp is this part of pa called little texas.fuck that shit, fuck it. but what i do think is that taking away our rights is not the answer. neither is american pride-if we could just learn to borrow more from other traditions- to embrace diversity- we would be a lot better off in the united states and the world as a whole.it's no wonder a lot of countries hate US; look around, we're fat, self righteous american assholes! &nbsp;

      i guess it's time to wakeup. today's my one day off in a little while and i just couldnt resist sleeping in.i actually feel awake for once. :)  i guess i should pray for my grandpa. he's having brain surgery today at hammot, but im remarkably not worried at all cause hammot is damn good, and im just hoping it can return him to his old self. he's had a lot of water in his brain for the past yearish. but grolemunds never give up and are some of the most stubborn ppl iknow, so i will be really surprised if it doesnt go well.regardless, it would/always is nice to have God nearby. ;)  on a random note, i took out my belly ring last night. the fugazi diamond fell out, and so i just threw the rest away. i think i may just keep it out. change is generally nice.since i cant get anymore tattoos or piercing, then i can easily alter my body by just takin that mofo out.hell yeah.goodbye old pierced me. now, whenever i can, i just need to get some new tats. ive had a hankering to get inked, and hopefully before the end of the summer, i can get some more work done.some ideas are a bumble bee truckin across my butt *lol*, the word faith in chinese character on my hip bone, the word forgiveness in celtic/gothic lettering across my back, or the aquarius symbol somewhere. who knows.maybe i wont even be able to get any for a while, but im still trying to think about them more than i did some of my others. i know the dragon on my belly was a very impulsive one and id still like to get it stretched across my entire belly.hello-yes-the woman does have power within her womb.it's the only one real powerful part of a woman, besides her brain, as far as i am concerned.but that's beside the point, if there ever was one. now, it's time to wake and bake.

      i feel like ive been waiting my whole life. it's funny how when something good is in front of you, you never notice it, never miss it-&nbsp;til it's gone for good. i can&nbsp;barely&nbsp;recall how many times ive had the chance for something good, something real, all growing up.ppl, guys, reaching out to me, and ive blown it. i used to be so closed.i used to be so shit scared of any prospect of anything good. i didnt realize back then that ppl would piss me off and that didnt mean the end of things. i didnt realize that i&nbsp; wasjust a fucking kid and didnt know everything altho it felt like i did.i didnt fucking realize how fragile the hands of time were.so many moves i wish i would/wouldnt have made.but i guess all in all, i havent been waiting, ive been living all these years.only now am i being burdened with the thought of waiting, of searching, and it is driving me fucking insane.only now am i left alone with my thoughts to haunt me day in and day out.i am stronger after all of the shit, but only now am i realizing, wHAT THE FUCK DID I DO?wHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING? i could have easily seen through all the  brilliant disguises  but i was too blinded by my own lies to myself. at least now i have cut through aLL of the bullshit, my own included.

      that heather thinks the  notion of love, marriage, all that will be damn near extinct by 2010.that as ppl grow more and more selfish, giving of oneself to family will continue to diminish. altho i seem SOme validity in this, i dont think this is the case. as bob put it- as l ong as there is blood pumping in my vains, i will love.. this just melted my heart. he is melting the heart that thought i couldnt/wouldnt love again..

      just how i feel today.woke up 10 to 12 and i just wanted to cry..i just wanted to somehow make this life make sense. and i didnt even drink last night... just really thinking about how hE is the first of many not to run.prolly the only one of many not to run.he's sticking around, i do believe.i could be wrong like so many times in the past tho-haha-im often wrong! but for real..it's wild..he has this gentleness, this silent sweetness about him that blows me away in his pisces.his backrubs put me RiGhT to sleep, like a newborn baby. hearing his stories just fucking amazes me.i cant believe the fucking govt.i cant believe, cannot fathom in all my wildest dreams why reefer is illegal and then the govt does shit like give high doses of oxycottons to ppl who have been in accidents for prolonged periods.he was on 80s for 18 mo.i cant believe the shit.and then the govt sees that yes-fucking duh-there is a problem and so just say he cant-isnt legally allowed to do those KinD anymore, but give tranquilizers and all kinds of other shit..so that the addition is transferred.i just can barely believe it. 115 pounds when he went into rehab and did not know his name.because of unc sam, thanks sam i am. but one crazy, random notioni  have got out of this.onet hing.i have wanted to move west, i have wanted to live near betsy, but not alone.i need someone.and i could imagine if i asked him to run away with me, he would..we would..

      so yeah, im still thinking about elm street..even tho it scares me in a way, goodness always overcomes evil, the light always shines through darkness.so like, as i was thinking last ni ght, as long as i do my best to always do unto others..i believe kindness spreads..i believe love can overcome any malidy. i know im super nieve in soo many ways.i know this.but like, i want to be child like.i want to hope for the best in ppl, i want to forgive, i want to believe in the power of love. what i dont want to do is work retail! haha! that was random! fer real tho-work to live not live to work.it's like-time spent in work is time away from my friends and family.all i care about is them, man, and im sad when im not with them.even my rents being gone this week-for how much they can drive me crazy-i still miss them.even tho too strict at times, overall my parents just put the necessary restraints on me soo i d ont go fucking wild like the other night.haha.i see how my rents are just doing their damnest to make a difference, just like me trying to help all my friends... but this time..haha.this t ime, im hoping for something good, im hoping for a keeper. i know he has problems, just like me, but it's pretty crazy when his ex wife thinks we would be good together and is fine with it! plus, he is growing up sooo much.not to sound conceited, but even just acting disapproving of his childish notions is helping to ground him, i believe.he's reading more.he's eating more. it's still hard for me to believe that he used to only be 115 lbs.he's come a long way, baby..and hopefully, hopefully i can help him come even further... :-)

      i dont  even know where to find the words to explain thursday and fri.however, today will probably end up being JUSTlike them: the neverending daze.. thursday night it must've been the moon, i have NO clue, but i have nEver gotten that crazy before.i asked ma to refresh me the next day and she reminded me that i was flashing and partially stripping! haha! damn! i had never acted that way before,not even at ozz fest when every other girlwas flashing their tits..altho i was a little bit embarassed yesterday,i  apologized to everyone and of course none of the guys minded!haha!damn! but fer real, they allll knew that was completely unlike me and normally im not that friendly.. and then last night.susan starts talking about alll the shit that has gone on down there.how heather used to cry because she was afraid of the guy with the yellow eyes and how ma never believed her.how they all hear unexplainable sounds all the time, how some ppl can only take a step in the house before they have to leave-some ppl automatically sense the evil presence(s)not of this world.she starts telling me about david witnessing some chick rape ryan and meanwhile ryan has no memory, no clue of anything. half the stuff ma, half the stuff everyone tells me, i would just rather-blow off. i would love to blow off.last night i was almost in tears (and im not a pussy) of fright cause ma was telling me more and more..letting me into the elm street world.. in the middle of all this, i cannot help but think of kat stringer.i cannot help but think of how she always wanted to trip, but how she believes (as do i) that it obv opens you up to other realms, worlds, and not nec safe ones.for this reason, i now feel o nly shaman or trained ppl should really trip cause otherwise you are just too vulnerable.. and then back to elm street-where u can come but never leave.i know about the BUttloads of hallucinogens that used to end in that house.ppl used to eat em like they were candy. no one was scared then.no one had any reason then NOT to believe that the world was everything it was cracked up to be.butnow..now..they've learned..regained sanity again..growin..older..:no one will touch the psychedelics.. all of ma's kids believe the place is haunted.the more and more i think about it, it seems like the place would have been a prime site for a grave yard: location location location. one thing's for sure:no one wants to stay alone.when susan,bob, and i got back from the bar, ryan tells us all he was scared when we were gone.and he's a grown guy. after ma told me all this shit and i was on the verge of crying, everyone came back from the bar.it was closing time, ya know.and soon, til 5 am, i was laughing my ass off-just trying to forget about all she had told me.freestyle rap with my stand up friends is really the best :-) it's alMOSt as nice, as refreshing, as meeting a guy who doesnt act differently after sex, who doesnt act entitled, who doesnt lose the respect, who knows when to listen and when to talk, someone who is honest, sensitive,sweet,giving,caring, and whose hair always smells soooo damn good.i could eat it.oh yeah.food.hungry. peaCe

      so i see 311 remade the cure's love song-pretty good, always down with 311, but the cure (hello, of course!) did such a better job.. so tonight is the night.susan and i are going out to the bar: her to see ed, me to see bobby.she asked me if we would practice discretion.i said :  of course. altho i would like (in a way) to just hook up with bobby and then not care what became of it (so in essence i would like to be a guy-less feeling, less emo), that's not the way i am in reality. in reality i feel. it's just not worth putting my tender heart in a blender anymore.i fucking care too much.i always end up getting shit on. i want something more this time.i dotn want lies, i dont want games, but i DO want a christian boy.almost every guy i have ever slept with was atheist/agnostic, and regrettably it shows through onto their lives, everything they do.(it's their worldview after all..)it just seems like christians are ususally nicer, more considerate, more loving, all that..(and you will know them by my name..) the one exception that i can think of was joey-he wasnt christian-but he was the biggest teddybear sweetheart anyone could imagine..he was just a freak of nature..but ultimately, he was motivated by love--being a good older brother/good example to his baby bro.. i dunno tho..im just, just excited about going out tonight-(if nothing else and that's what it will turn out to be cause..wtf..bobby could be my dad..)-he's eye candy.it's flattering, is all.flattering that i can still get young guys and old ones-i still am able to shake my ass as i stride across a room and have guys come to me cause im not fucking going to them..btw-craig called! hah! i didnt think he would, either, but he did.i was on the phone with  my bro in england or else but it surprised me..im not quite sure of his intentions-cause he i think he just may be ayoung black hottie player, but as long as him and i arent getting trashed (dont think that'll be a prob-he's underage!), then im fine.it's just when i drink too much that all caution goes out the window with mypanties..hahha.

      so i asked somebody the day after the garage party and they said the kid who fell and hit his head was ok.the kid that got knocked unconscious after being boxed in the head. somebody told me a he was just fine,..with further examination, i believe it  was holly cause ray's good friends were the chess's. they would say he's fine.he's not dead, right? but here's the deal-he has no short term memory. the night that he fell and hit hsi head after being socked in it by a professionalish boxer, he was fucked. i didnt leave until someone kEPT telling me there was an rn there and basically he was in good hands.well, i come to find out the chick is in her 3rd year and even she told some characters that he should be taken to the er.they didnt listen to her and put him outside, laughing (i hope!) at the fact that he was so drunk. his parents too him to the er the next day. he came home andkept taking showers:3,4, he kept doing it and his parents thought he was on drugs.in reality, his memory is alllllllllll fucked up: short term and long term.it's like groundhogs day X100.i dont know what else is wrong with him, im sure something bad, and i feel.i feel...bad.i should NOT have left.the fucking polish in me.just like my grandma blaming herself for my grandpa being on his dealthish bed cause of this fuckign hammot brain surgery (complications-swelling-damage)just like her blaming herself, i mean damn, i guess in retrospecti shoudltn have been such a fucking burnout.i could have helped that boy.i had my cell on me.i could have called the cops.i was afraid.i was afraid.i just wanted everyone to be ok. it's just that they started boxing riGHt in front of me,  almost showing off to me.sigh.......and then his head hit the floor. david told me tonight he just wanted to keep playing after it happened. i said that was ok, totally normal, music is an escape like anything else.fer real.and so, he;s learned.i was best friends with their dad who killed himself, and damn-any tragedy obv has a reaction-action-reaction.he;s become more adept at disassociating on something random-any sort of obj, action, ya know.but that's totally ok-the body needs ways to cope with shit-music, exercise, self expression, religious balance seem to be the key.. but yeah, i think there is a pending investigation.the kid iwas 16... fock

      aww man: so i had a chance to see my old school friend tiffy tonight but i was workin. :( she called RIGHT before i got home and said she was in visiting from clevo.i get to see her about twice a year..i guess the night is still youngish so it wouldnt surprise me if she still dropped by. tiffy and i were best friends since k on, taking dance together, doing musicals together in school (i dont even remember aNy of it-i have to have tiffy clue me in), just being kids. as the years went by, her and i quit being as close..same old story, ya know but it's weird how even though we were apart for SOO long, we are still fundamentally the same. i mean, her and i are the biggest airheads, most nieve, gullible ppl you could ever meet. for real, i mean, i guess she is a bigger airhead than me but not by much.THEN her and i didnt date in hs, but when we did, we both met bad boys who easily used us..but now, now, her and i still carry the legacy that the fockers have left us-the ability to par-tay :) and her and i are both wild as hell-i mean, she might not stop by tonight cause she is partying with someone else, but tiffy-hell-she's crazy kewl :)it was tiffy's idea to drive to cleveland at 12 am in bad snowy weather to see our friend lisa at the art institute. thank God betsy had something to give her to slow down or we would hvae been reaLLy fucked! she drives like anut too!umm what elseher and i are both into fashion,music, education,sociology, reform later in life christians, all that.LOl.gosh, imiss tiffy.and so, we quit being friends for years cause she was in the straightedge biblish bookworm crowd, and i was into the stoner alterna crowd.but then after she graduated from hs, she came around :) she realized how much fun she had been missing out on..just happene dto be by meeting billy from philly-short (5'3ish) full bred italien from philly.it wouldnt have been such a problem had he NOT been such a lil bitch and also into selling h.yikes!oh, i gues si cant be too hard on her tho cause i also have a similar drive in me-to date, as my dad would like to put it, these "lowlifes.. who end up pulling me down.." :(  imean obv i start out and see the good in them just like she does but then when we find out what assholes they are, we are already STUCK.her and i-this is another thing!-are soo, too loyal.and trusting.and agreeable (altho her moreso than me..)damn..find these guys that we want to fix, help. i mean, it's like me saying i like to see bobby. in a way, yeah, but in another-hell0-there is a reason he's been single this long. he actually was dating my old (old school!) friend, but they are no more.i dunno. it's like, i would think-how cool would it be if I singLehanded or woah maybe two hands but anyway, tamed the town spinster? but, i know it will never happen. at least not by me. altho it's funt o dream about.. ok, so blah.im rambling.drinken.bord.stoned.blase blah.

      Sunday, August 01, 2004    it's shitty how it's eithter feast or famine..at lease for Mo=with work aNd life. work-either's it's really fucking busy or it's slow and i am sent home. with life, either there will be tons of prospective random ass ppl, or not a damn thang. there will be stuff going on at the lake, the garage, at the cottage, or elsehwere, or ill be lucky to go down to fenstemaker-reinhard's to find one other person beside matt, susan, or ryan(damn, i almost forgot his name and he's been almost living there over a yr!). regardless,im meeint all kinds of ppl all a t the same time. older guys, younger guys, guys my age, damn i love em all..:) haha! and i finally met a black guy too! im soo excited! it's funny how we went to school for years together and back then-well, both of us were rather different.now ijust happen to meet him at a lake party and he wants to chill..very cool..and even tho he's a quarterback or some shit at ysu, he still has a dash of his gay older brother's flair..it rocks!...im sure it prolly wont go that far-im REaLLy just glad that im making more friends, meeting new ppl.. bobby, gosh, i dont kno wwhat would have happened had i not had to work the next day. susan tried to tell me that he's at least 43, i really didnt think that was the case, i thought he was 40, but i guess he can afford to be three yrs older cause at his worst he looks like he's in his 30's..i just really think it would be strange but cool if him and i hooked up.afterall, he's only known me since i was one and posing naked on bear rugs. my friend told me=he's prolly seen you naked, mo, and i said, yeah, so what? ive grown up since them..im a big girl now :) gosh, all ir eally got going on is some good eye candy, meeting some new ppl.i would love to say that i could just meet them, party with them, sleep with them, but i just dont feel down with that lifestyle much anymore.something inside me has changed for the better. i am wiser and i know too well that path.-how it's just like drinking-it feels good, great at the time, and then later you pay for it (all my friends with kids/stds) OR for me-being lucky-with my blood and tears cause they werent all they cracked themselves up to be.lies.it always comes back to lies. i want something more permanent this time around. it's like, im only 23, but something inside of me feels soo much older-like 32, 33ish.i guess it was partially from hanging around ken, spi, fairlight for so long-they aRe that age.and then there was hanging with uncle when i was 16 on. he DID just turn 40.but i dunno-i just cant do the games anymore. a friend of mine told me a while ago that it isnt really games, it should be called self preservation and all this SHIT.im sorry, i cant get over thinking that it IS and always will be fucking bullshit games in my book. i hear about now how the same person who liked to fuck with my head is doing similar shit to someone else-GAMES. i mean, they obv arent even intentional, i dont think, but generally the person has soo much shit in their own life that they have to play bullshit GAMES with you. i dont need it, i dont wnat it, i wont take it.i guess that's why the thought of an older guy has always been appealing to me.hell, i started dating ken when he was 27 and i was 19.i mean, theoretically, they know who they are by now so that they DONT have/want to play games.if i ever meet a young guy who is straight up, i will be surprised.i dont want none of this pussy footing beating around the bush lies drama games SHIZAT nope, all i want is the truth. something good for onCe in my life. of course this is soo much easier said than done. but i really dont want single 20 something life anymore..ok..maybe just for a bit.lol.i want passion and excitment. i want someone to explore the world, life, l-i-v-i-n. someone who isnt afraid of change.. ya know, i actually read in an article sometime, somewhere that other than the ability to laugh together (or wait-was That    said back  then that everything that i stood for was a lie and so thus i knew i should change but i couldnt cause i was too caught now in the spiderwebs/my own buried self hatred/iGNORANCE?no, now, i am more aware of the truth=all i have to lose, gain, offer.
