      I wonder why Pink is the color for breast cancer?  Is is because most victims of breast cancer are women?  Because it is a color of femininity?  Because it is the color of your eyes from the date of diagnosis til who know when? Because it is the color your skin turns after days and days of continuous radiation treatments?  I never liked pink.  Black was my color of choice.   Black made a statement!  Black could be dressed-up or dressed down.  Black matched EVERYTHING!  Put ona black skirt...didn't matter what top you wore, put on a black top...doesn't matter what color or pattern pants you were.  Black was easy, black was comfortable, black was "safe."  Now it's "pink!" The color I once thought stood for softness and weakness and frailness.  I realize I am drawn to it as I never thought I would be.  And you know what??  It's a color of strength, a color of courage and a color that has brought me closer to my family and a whole new family of "sisters"  I have just met this past year.  Ones that share my fondness of pink and unity and optimism.  Optimism that maybe, just maybe pink will again remind us of femininity, not breast cancer

      Oh my gosh...Is it really possible. My son will be "18" tomorrow. Technically that makes him an adult, honestly, that still makes him my responsibility and it's a BIG ONE! He has so much life ahead of him. High school graduation, college, college graduation (hopefully), a career, marriage, children. I want the BEST for him and fear that I will not be able to give it to him. He will have to work HARD, VERY HARD. I will try with all my heart to do as much as I can, but it's going to be up to him to make it through. I want him to have more than I had, to have more than I was able to give to him. To live his life to the fullest and LOVE every waking minute of it. To find someone wonderful to share it with and to just be......Happy! Not only do I want these things for him, but I pray that I will be around to see them. He may not have had everything a child could have wanted growing up, but he was never short on LOVE! I hope he knows and will always know that. Things may not have always been good, or always gone the way he wanted, but he was loved more than any child could ever be loved. I miss my little boy, but I really enjoy being with the young man he has grown up to be. Being a mom completed my life.

      Tomorrow is Monday, back to work for me and back to the babysitter for my 4 yr old.  If there is one thing that cancer did give me, it was the opportunity to slow down for a year and realize  what's important and whats really NOT!  I spent more time with my children in the past year than ever, just talking and going places and learning about THEM.  Do you know the most important part of my daughters day at day care???  Snack time!  Yes, she IS definately her Mamma's girl. Wed is her favorite snack day because it's M&M day.   She is wise for her years, (I think the cancer had a hand in that also) yet, she's just 4 and I love 4.  It's the most wonderful age for her to be...until of course, she turns 5.  I learned alot about my son this past year.  He has a wonderful sense of humor, weird...quirky...and somewhat outside the norm, but wonderful just the same.  I realized that I wasn't near the embarrassment to him that I thought I was.  Actually, I think I was less embarrassing without hair than I was with.  He is very responsible and caring and capable of not only taking care of himself, but also his sister when I was too ill to get out of bed.  So, tomorrow is Monday and we're off to begin another week.  I used to hate Mondays, because they were Mondays, but I've learned to love Mondays, because they are days.  Days with my family, days with my friends and days I'm still here to listen to people complain because it Monday!   Tomorrow is Monday....Happy Monday!

       Why am I blogging? Good quetion. Not really sure myself. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 03. Since then my world seems to be on fast forward, as does my brain. You never think it can happen to you. I was 36 years old, with NO family history of breast cancer AT ALL! It has been a year of terror and triumph for me and my family. As I said, my brain is on fast forward. I wish there were a switch that I could just tunr off sometimes so that I could have some peace! No...it's not little voices in my head, it's all the 'what if's and could of's and should of's and did I make the right choice." It's a very exhausting experience. I guess I just felt that maybe by blogging, it might free up some of the if's, of's and but's and get my life back to it's normal pace.   I will continue to blog until either it doesn't seem to help, or things continue so fast that I can't slow down long enough to sit and blog. I guess we'll see what happens!
