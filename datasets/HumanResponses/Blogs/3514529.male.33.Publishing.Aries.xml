      I've been working my fat ass off on the Seminars thingy and its dragging on due to the mathematical nature of the copy. I'm sure it would be more interesting if I understood what it all meant, but its bad enough having to lay insurance copy on page without having to read it. There's enough Greek symbols in there to keep even the most classical scholar happy but sorry it ain't for me Plato darling!  Anyway yah boo to that! Working for myself eases the pain of having to do the odd (dreadfully) boring job, and I do get the sunshine streaming in through the open window as I work, and despite the fact that there is a near-constant drone of traffic, I get to watch a lot of local wildlife – blackbirds, robins, thrushes, pigeons (but clean ones) and that nice bird from the first floor. Most nights the foxes will come by searching the undergrowth in front of the block for whatever may be hiding there or the odd piece of discarded Kentucky fried chicken. There's tons of foxes around here, though one less as a car hit and killed one about a month ago, pity. I know people give out about them but I love them, as it reminds me of my rural origins, without the lack of electricity and the freezing of pipes in winter. We've even got a fox that sunbathes on the roof of platform 1 in Denmark Hill station, and you can watch him there from the main part of the station before you get your train. He's a rather scrawny little fellow and looks like a fairly young adult, so he's probably fighting for some territory, hence why he's settled on the station itself. Fairly clever if you ask me, as long as some idiot doesn't fancy a target for his airifle.  Anyway, I managed a good deal of work today though I stayed in bed until 9.30 as I hadn't been sleeping well recently. As stated earlier the project is dragging on as I get to grips with the intricacies of the insurance world, but the feedback from the States has been excellent, and I'm well on target to be completed before schedule. So, feeling rather enthusiastic about things but also finding myself in the early throws of cabin fever I went running again tonight. My last time had been 35 minutes constant running, but tonight I managed 1 hour 2 minutes!!!! My theory of not having a pint at lunchtime paid dividends, though I think we all knew it would. Having only before managed to get to the park then go round it once, this time I completed 2.5 circuits, which is a hell of a jump. I'll go again on Friday, but it'll surely be difficult to go any longer. Still, its a good feeling knowing I can do it, and the rate of improvement is just the thing to drive me towards that marathon next year, that I might run, I'd like to run, I intend on running, but I ain't promising anything.  Well, chr*st I rant about nothing. Now for my daily Euro 2004 watch – did you see that the hosts Portugal finally won a game having been handed the advantage of an extra man after the ref rather kindly adjudged the Russian keeper to have handled the ball outside the box? Despite this helping hand the Portuguese huffed and puffed until finally sealing the victory they desperately needed by scoring a second goal with only couple of minutes to go. Go on yah Portugal – the game is better with you involved, and where else can we see the Camel cigarettes Camel (whats his name?) in the guise of Luis Figo? He just looks so incredibly miserable its worth having him in there just to cheer me up, and if anything he's a great incentive to give up smoking, or at least to smile a little.  Greece and Spain had earlier drawn 1-1, though Spain really should have won on the superior performance they gave. Morientes grabbed a beauty after clever linkup play with Raul before the Greeks battled away and grabbed a cracking goal on the break with some tanned geezer called Charisteas planting one in the old onion bag. I would have thought the success of the Greeks is causing an extra nightmare for the authorities back home as its robbing the workforce of tens of thousands who could otherwise be sent to lend a hand finishing all those stadiums and other assorted Olympic infrastructure which remains seriously behind schedule. Still, its a commendable effort and they remain favourites to finish top of the group while Spain and Portugal must fight it out to qualify for the second round. All this and we still have Engerland to play tomorrow! Come on my adopted country!! I suggest a worldwide boycott of Nestle if the Swiss get a result. Dammit we're already boycotting them. Oh well. So good luck to Beckham and the boys, there's an Irish man in South London who's cheering for you.  So, with that I'm off to do some work and try and get some sleep as my flippin knees are killing me. I've got an old skiing injury that might ache a bit now that I'm getting fit (or at least making an effort). But thats another story, and a good one, at least better than the crap I've just been waffling about. But then again thats what blogs are about, right? You get to write whatever you want, for no reason except that it makes you happy. I like that. G'd night.

      It wasn't too hard to find a title to tonights musings, seeing as I hardly slept at all last night. it was strange as I jogged for 35 minutes yesterday evening, which for me is the most I've done in 10 years! I had a weird dream where my situation kept on changing (though I can't remember why) and everytime it did so I woke up and changed position in my bed, only to lapse back into the same dream again. To be honest I think I just had the same two dreams over and over, like two planetary orbits, and every now and again they would cross each others path, causing me to swap over and follow an orbit until they crossed again and I could swap back, and so on and so forth… zzzzz. Bloody stiff and sore this morning though.   I decided to get out of bed just after 6am anyway, as I was awake and had a lot to do, so I started work at 7am. I worked until 9am on this Seminar Proceedings document then had a snooze for an hour. Thanks to the power of smoothies and coffee I finally finished working at 10pm this evening, just in time to see Skinner and Badiel and they're new Fantasy Football show – not seen since Euro '96, if I'm correct. They make me laugh. I also managed to take in some of the Czech Republic v Latvia game, which wasn' t the best display of football I've ever seen. But did anyone catch the Sweden v Bulgaria game yesterday? What a game – and what a cracking diving header from that man Larsson! Pity he's left Celtic after all those years. Luck of the Irish my arse.  Anyway, despite the distraction of football I still managed 13 hours work today, and really broke the back of the Seminar project. I've had some feedback already from my client in America and they're happy. I reckon another good start tomorrow should have it completed by the end of play, which then leaves me 2 days (!!!) to get another magazine finished – it doesn't rain but it pours! Even allowing for corrections I'm well on target to get the Seminars project to the printers as planned next Wednesday. Of course my editor on the magazines had forgotten (??) about going to press as this is the first time the mag in question is under his stewardship – so nice one mate! Its down to me to pull another cat out of the bag and get it to press for Monday. One plus however is that it has a new deputy editor who's well cute!! A fine looking lass indeed, and more importantly she seems very down to earth, which makes for a pleasant change. Its strange having so many big projects on the go at the same time, but I guess its good for business, and heaven knows I need it. Its not so bad though when they involve pretty girls. Jeez, thank god for small mercies.  I also had some great news today that my friend J had a successful operation last Thursday. I was nervous about it so had some of my Buddhist friends chant feverishly beforehand, and it seems to have done the trick. Hopefully she'll be bouncing around like the busybody she was before long.   Anyway the plan for tomorrow is to complete the Seminars thingy and get on top of everything else. I finally got paid some overdue money this week which has kept my bank happy though I need to be frugal for a couple of months to get back on track properly. It doesn't help a freelancer when silly whankers go on holidays and leave your invoices in their intrays, but there are people worse off than me so no harm done in the long run, though I won't be so quick to answer the call in future, which is rubbish of course as I always say yes to the work and am a sucker for a cry for help. I seem to spend a lot of my time digging clients out of holes they've created for themselves… perhaps a stauncher temperament is needed.  If I get the seminars yokeebob done I'll be off running again with a new target in mind, and with my weight coming down all the time soon I'll be feeling a lot better about things. At 14.75 stone (I'll work out the metric crap some other time) I'm just slightly below what I was after my injury last winter. My target is to get down to 12.5, so we'll see how I fare. And who knows? – I might even attract the eye of a passing lass who also hasn't had sex in a long time, and who weirdly has a soft spot for overweight, hairy Irishmen.  And on that note I think its time for bed and hopefully some sweet dreams, or at least some decent sleep. G'd night.

      At the weekend I enjoyed a top night with my mate from school N. He's really impressed me with his adhesion to the new rules he's set himself with regards to his health, and though I've helped in some small way to keep him on the straight and narrow, its really his own steely determination thats changing him from a socially nervous, fag-puffing boozer into the interesting, chatty, witty fit man-about-town that he is fast becoming. Good on yah boy! Even though drugs were never his thing, he still had to dig into his reserves to find the willpower to give up smoking, drink less, take up swimming, and change his diet. The effects have been immediate, and as a positive side effect he has started to score with the ladies too. It still takes a fair bit of persuasion to get him to make the move and say hello (generally about 5 pints will do it) but after that he's finding the results encouraging. In fact on Saturday he scored twice (by scoring I mean a snog). One of the girls bored of his conversation so much she insisted on stemming the flow by sticking her tongue half way down his oesophagus, while the second wasted no time at all in dragging him into a bedroom for some action. N played the gentleman and didn't take things too far, but there was obviously time enough for some naked action as was proved by the fact she left her rather expensive underwear behind. It was a pretty interesting lunch hour on Sunday which saw her and her friend return for some tea and a chat, then announcing the real reason was to collect said items. I think they may have thought an ebay auction was just around the corner but we ain't that sad.  What about me I hear you ask? Well, I kissed a girl in a club who bit me, then spent a lovely night chatting with an very interesting buddhist girl (who didn't even try to bite me), smoking cigarettes, and watching the dawn come up over the trees. Smashing. And a smashing way to say goodbye to the fags, horrible things that they are. Unfortunately I still have some of my last packet remaining, but once they're finished thats it – for good – I promise.  Anyway, N is putting me to shame with his health kick, so I've finally started to push on with mine. Now swimming'snot my thing but tennis is, so I've joined a club, and work permitting I intend to play at least 3 times a week. I've never played competively, and at 33 my best years are no doubt well and truly behind me, but I've been hitting the ball better than ever this year so am anxious to see if I can cut it in a small London club. The fact the club has 6 ladies team served in no small way to encourage me. Tennis being a game played best with firm balls, I'm hoping my service action will do the business if called upon. (I know, thats truly awful).  So, today I started running again, which I have only done once in the past two weeks. A weekend in Ireland and another in Greece has made exercising difficult, and if not difficult then at least inappropriate, seeing that both occassions involved boozy festivities, with no room for the best a Leo Sayer workout can offer. I have a route that I stick to, but each time I try and beat my last mark, then complete the route walking. The back end of the route involves Brockwell Park in Herne Hill, which I've only managed to get half way around. Well today I completed the whole thing with no walking and no stops, despite the fact that I had a pint at lunchtime with my uncle. I'm slightly unsure what to do now – do I continue to have a pint every lunchtime or try and see if my running will improve without the pint? I think I know the answer. The toal running time was 35 minutes, which beat my last run by 10, so things are coming on in leaps and bounds, or a series of tiny, lethargic, sweat-laden steps.  I'm feeling a lot more positive about that side of things so hopefully I can go the extra nine yards and run that marathon I've always believed is somewhere in me. If only I can manage to have the same success with my work I'll be laughing. Its been two months now since I've started to work from home and I'm finding that the cricket and now Euro 2004 are making it difficult to remain disciplined and put in the hours my work requires. Luckily its not been too busy but now its really started to pick up so I need to get moving and start designing! I have a deadline for Wednesday which involves laying out 150 pages of seminar proceedings (oh the glamour of the design profession) so I need to pull the cat out of the proverbial bag.  My plan tomorrow: up at 7.30, start work at 8.30, break for lunch, work until the lot if done. Sounds like a lot but its achieveable, especially if I stay focussed. Ideally it'd be great to have the lot done by 5 and the early evening kick-off, but I might just have to miss that one. Dammit. Oh, well, speaking of work perhaps I'd best stop this awful ranting and just go to bed, get some sleep, and start bright and early. Wish me luck!

      An Odyssey? Maybe? Odd? Definitely. A stag (substitute 't' for 'h') party on a greek island, barely a 5 hour flight, 4 hour coachride and a 20 minute ferry away, give or take whatever time it takes to get through the various security checks and any delays we may have thanks to our wonderful air traffic system's computer crashing this morning. Tonight I part and tomorrow (please Zeus) I arrive to help my friend LJ kiss goodbye to the single life with a little help from a healthy posse of friends. As one of the 'senior' members (I think members may come into play often on this trip) I feel distinctly under pressure to guide my young friends through the hazzards of a boys weekend in the sun. Perhaps I am merely adopting a fatherly role so as to keep myself out of trouble. Who knows. Onwards I go, with no expectations and a bumper pack of condoms, just in case anybody forgot to pack properly, of course. I pity LJ, because all his friends will be throwing themselves at anything in a bikini (and who can blame them) while he remains staunchly faithful. But I salute his morals and agree. If you have found love, why ruin it so flippantly?  Isn't it odd that islands steeped in such a rich history have now become the favoured place for a hassle-free summer shagfest? I wouldn't know of course, but my willingness to try most things at least once could well land me in trouble. Whatever happens I'm looking forward to it. I haven't had the best of luck with women lately (I'm using the term 'lately' very loosely) so a quick summer romance could be just the ticket, though romance is optional, and preferably not. All I need is five minutes and I'm done, honestly. I was discussing rules of engagement recently with some friends of mine, but I fear the introductory line "Do you have any Irish in you? Do you want some?" might not make the right sort of impression. Back to that willingness to try most things once… I also think 'rules of engagement' is a bit of a red herring, as I have absolutely no intention of getting engaged at all.  Yes, women, women, women. Anybody with any answers please post them because I certainly don't have a clue. I thought I was a bit messed up, but I've encountered some rather interesting females as I've gone through life. My sister thinks that perhaps I've always gone for mad women because it makes me feel quite sane. Well thanks very much. I know I'm odd but I'm not crazy, though some of my girlfriends have definitely been straightjacket material. There was one who attacked me with a knife because I said something derogatory about David Bowie (apologies to any fans – please don't hit me), and another who completely invented a new life for herself even though her family lived only ten miles away. Now this wasn't ten miles of thick, inhospitable, tiger-filled jungle, but a quick jaunt up a main road to the nearest town. I had another who had 'father' issues as he never paid any attention to her when she was a kid so she flirted with any man and his brother in front of me, and another who came from a wealthy family and couldn't go out with me anymore because I wasn't a solicitor living in Islington. It took me ages to get over that one, as I cursed the gods for giving me a talent with art but not litigation! The most recent one I thought was nice, very nice, but she got pissed and snogged my flatmate in front of me in the pub, (will talk about him another time) apparently thinking he was me, though we don't look anything alike, are from a differnt country, he has a beard and glasses, and had just had a curry. So, as you can see, I'm unsure exactly whats on the menu on this little jaunt.  So, with slight trepidation I set sail on my mini adventure. I love women, and have loved before. But, as I have been hurt so many times I am determined to uphold some vow of chastity while I try and sort my head out. I think that is the best plan, at least until the 12th sambuka takes hold and I think I'm Paris of Troy, ready to steal the heart of any woman. If only Aphrodite was here so that I might gain the love of one. Anyway, hopefully me and my morals will find some balance, or else I shall leave them behind so I can go and enjoy myself, find some nice sunburnt essex girl, and get some sand in awkward places, as befits such as occasion.   I shall keep you posted.

      Its been a long time since I've been truly happy. To be honest I think it was when I was 4. There are some fond memories of giving an apple to my teacher because I liked to play with her daughter, who's name I can't remember. But I do I remember she had golden hair and would hold my hand as we walked and kiss me goodbye every day, on the lips. Thats 29 years ago, so a lot has happened since then. An awful lot.  When I was 5 my parents moved to a rural part of Ireland, just inside the pale, but still very backward and poor. My Mum still lives there in the arts & crafts house she and my father painstakingly renovated and transformed from a cold, lifeless relic into a colourful, radiant family home. Unfortunately the family has left, and the house has begun to wear a frown, sad that the lives it sheltered have needed to say goodbye and move on. It was a lovely house, but now it is a lonely house.   It has a ghost, though you never saw him, but he was there. We could hear him pacing the floors upstairs when we played scrabble or watched some late night television. He often entered the oldest room in the house while I was reading, bringing with him a cold but benign chill. And once he even played the piano in the big room and woke us up. I was always confused which had the more powerful spirit, the house, or the ghost. Was it the house that was alive, or the ghost that gave it life? Or are the two so intrinsically linked they are inseperable? One and the same. I'd like to believe the latter, as I cannot seperate them, for sure.   My father had a theory that the ghost was that of a priest who had hidden from the english in the priesthole we uncovered while doing some remodelling of the oldest rooms. Apparently he had a dream and the priest appeared as clear as day. If its true he was obviously a musical priest with an interest in books and a liking of children, though not in the way priests are now mostly suspected.  Unfortunately for the house it was always be remembered alongside the bullying in the local schools, primary and secondary, where as outsiders we became instant targets for abuse of immeasureable cruelty. It was a tough area with tough people who for the most shed their misery by heaping it on others. We were viewed with suspicion from day one to now, and the only escape was to move away, to private schools, but also away from my family. It forced our parents to work harder, spending more and more time away from their children. A strangling vicious circle.   There are mistakes we make and things that happen that are out of our control. The house bore witness to so many it's stories could be long and tragic. But thankfully there is also the beauty of life, and the life we as a family brought to its stone walls. I'd like to think its memories of the 28 years of our occupation would on the whole be favourable. My parents, like all parents, were misguided at times but were very, very kind people with the best of intentions, so at 350 years and counting the house is an old soul, but surely never more lovingly fulfilled than in those times. Unlike people a house cannot choose who occupies it, though like a dog and its owner there can be obvious cases of a bad partnership. I'd like to think we had a good one.   I live in London now, trying to make my way in the world, and until recently its been a struggle. I made the decision to move over here after my father died from a heart attack. The dynamics of my family had changed in the most tragic circumstances, and the life force of the house had been altered forever. I missed the house and my family terribly, especially my father. Within the next two years I lost three of my best friends, two to suicide and one to a motorbike accident. Ireland, my home, had ceased to be a refuge and had become a tomstone bearing the inscription: "Here lies the memories of 4 lost souls who left before their time." My family have worried about how I would handle it. My sister especially, with whom I share the most striking characteristics, is wary of my mental health, and conscious of my enormous loss.   I 've recently returned from a weekend with my near and extended family in Ireland, though not at our house. We were in Glandore, a beautiful part of West Cork, hidden way in the slopes and fingers of stunning coastline. I remember from art college the splashing and daubing of paint onto canvas in the most random fashion, a dash here, a bold stoke there, a dynamic sweep here, and sprinkle of colour there. West Cork is like that, nature's palette, where you round a corner or climb a hill to find something completely unexpected, yet beautiful. I woke up in my bed at dawn and saw the sea. It was the first time in a long time it felt good to be home, and though not my family home, it was a start. I saw my niece, who is 1, and remembered that life needs to go on, but in the right way.  So, I have decided its time to shed the weight I have been carrying for so long. Feeling sorry for myself is understandable but it has stunted my growth and dented my character. I am 33 now and bear the obvious signs of somebody who hasn't taken the greatest care of myself, thrown from one catastrophy to another, seeking solice in some of the less savoury of London's offerings. That time is over now. I want to make the most of my life, and perhaps begin to fulfill the potential my father and my friends saw in me, and maybe, some time in the future, go home to the old house and say hello to the ghost. As I've been writing I've been remembering a lot of good times too, so it won't always be so dreary.   It'll be a long road with its share of twists and turns, but I'll write it all down so you can walk a while if you wish.
