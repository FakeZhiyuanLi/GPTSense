       Welcome to my ears.  Listen.  Listen closely.  The ocean sometimes speaks to you.  "Go read The Joy Luck Club" it says.  "Go read it now."

       Today was a bit of a let-down.  It also showed me how unreliable short-term weather forecasts can be.  The forecast for today changed so much so fast.  One hour they'd forcast sun, then the next they'd say rain, and continually shift from one to another.  My friends and I planned to go hiking on an extension of the Appalachian Trail that was right by our town, which would be a few hours worth of hiking.  However, this morning it began to get cloudy and then it started to rain, which ruined our plans.  I'm hoping we'll be able to go soon, such as this weekend.  I would complain more about things that will most likely seem trivial to me come next week, but I'm getting tired of this tonight.

       I adore the extremely hot, summer-like weather.  Today was unseasonably warm for most of the northeast; in my region of Pennsylvania, it was nearly 20 degrees above the average temperature for the 19th of April.  86 degrees in mid-April..such a wonderful taste of summer!  I'd say about 50% of the trees now have neon-green leaves.  Hopefully today sparked the rest of them and they'll start by tomorrow or the next day.  Tomorrow is supposed to be nice, too, but back to normal April temps in the 60's, which I still consider shorts weather.  I know I'm just rambling about something most don't care about at all, and I also know that I'm not being characteristically witty, but I just wanted to share this with everyone.

       Although lunchladies have it pretty bad, I feel that the students have it even worse.  The women only have to look at the putrid pizza and hometown servings; we actually have to eat them, or at least purchase them, take one bite, and then push the tray away from ourselves.  I walk into Lunch A today, speedily, so I could get mine quickly and sit down with friends.  I chose the "Hometown"/"The Grill" line, because that's what I always choose because I'm lazy and don't like to walk long distances if I don't absolutely have to.  I walk in and see some odd yellow objects that look like marshmallows staring at me while bopping up and down.  OBVIOUSLY, I pass these by.  You never know what could be in them.  I sure as hell knew it wasn't marshmallow..  Next, in the grill portion of the line, I see....*gasp!* CHILI CHEESEBURGERS AND MEATBALL SUBS!!  ...Gruesome...both of them....  I picked the meatball one by default.  Plus it was closer to me.  When I got to my table, I opened the bag, and see what looks like a river of hardened earwax covering it (which was actually supposed to be cheese...).  I tried to not look at it as I ate it.  Since the school provides such horrid food, I never feel bad when I have a cold and hand my tray to the cleaning lunchladies with 10 dirty tissues on it. ;)

       This morning started off kind of odd.  I wake up and my clock reads 5:30, yet its fully light out.  Since it was DST, I knew times would seem messed up, but I was pretty sure it was supposed to be darker in the morning.  I then get the insane idea that there was a full solar eclipse, which, looking back upon, doesn't even make ANY sense whatsoever because an eclipse would make it dark.  I knew my morning mind was screwed up, but not THAT screwed up.  I decide to turn on my computer to see what it's brilliance would tell me about the time.  "7:30" read the time in the pseudo-mac taskbar, which was still inhumanly early for me to awaken on a Sunday morning, especially for falling asleep at 1 or 2.

       Man, parking lots can be kind of annoying sometimes.  Even just driving through them can be an upmost test of one's patience.  I drive in to the plaza from a road behind the Walmart and turn in.  People are running around crazilly everywhere and traffic is horrible.  We move about a foot and then abruptly stop again while smiling, squinting, elderly people begin to cross the street haphazardly.  I wanted to go to Burlington for a black hoodie.  BIG MISTAKE!!11one.  I went through 3 bays looking for parking spaces, only to find each and every one that didn't have a blue chair on it to be full.  I ended up parking in a lot across the street.  Burlington is pretty much a joke, but at least I found SOMETHING that I liked, so we bought that.  On the way out, I was in a hurry to get home, so I was driving more speedily that usual, but still being semi-cautious for pedestrians.  I just love how people cross the street and don't even look.  It must be so much fun to nearly get hit by cars!!  Then people cross halfway, almost decide to cross in front of you but then don't, so you start driving, then they decide that they do want to cross in front of you and then change their mind again!  Fun, fun, fun..

       I was banned from a forum a few weeks ago for voicing my opinions.  Amazingly, Ver was able to coax the feeble excuse for an "administrator" to let me back in, though god only knows why I would ever want to go back.  Forums where hormonal 13 year old males only talk about "chicks, queers, and sex" aren't my thing, really.  Conversations are on the same lines of communicating with a 12 year old AOLer in that every post seems to include several LOL's, OMG's, WTF's, etc.  They banned me because I apparantly "emotionally traumatized" the administrator's younger brother by constructively criticizing the forum.  That was just the first time.  I continued to voice my opinions, despite what the heathens said to me and called me, and they banned me again just for voicing my opinion.  Communism was sooo 1950's, man.

       I've begun the hunt today.  (For a job, that is)  I refuse to work anywhere dealing with food or gas, so that leaves quite a few places around town out (and yeah, I know I DID say that I refuse to work in town, but I guess that changed a little...).  Anyway, my ideal job in this town would be working at Pencor, the local internet/technology company.  I don't really care what I'd be doing there, just as long as I'm getting paid for it ;)  Ideally, I would like to do some kind of secretorial work, such as typing, organizing, etc.  It may sound a bit dull, but at least I would be in sitting in a nice, cool office instead of standing at a cash register somewhere.  Today is my friend Martin's birthday thing.  He's picking me up in about an hour and I'll stay at his house until around 7 when I'll drive home.  I went out and got his card this morning, too, when we did a tiny bit of job searching.  I have an increased optimism about being able to afford a car.  It would be ideal if my Mom could get herself a new car and I would then receive her current Neon.  However, if things don't work out that way, I could just get a car for about $1000 or less.  As long as it could take me to school and work it'll be fine.  Speaking of driving, I can't wait until late July, when I will finally be able to take my driver's test.  I am pretty confident in my abilities to pass, but I DO need to work on parking and parallel parking some more.  But, thankfully, I have time to do so, since my test is still over 2 months away.  Currently I am eating celery and peanut-butter and drinking Dr. Thunder.

       I can't wait until I get my driver's license.  Then I can act all cool and pimp with my arm hanging out the door and my music blasting as loud as it goes while driving around town aimlessly!  Sounds simple, yet unexplainably fun!  But seriously, I do want my license this summer so that I'll be able to drive to school next year.  ..And that brings up the whole job issue.  I do not have a job.  I have never had a job.  I need to get a job.  My Mom wants me to find one "in town", but of course I refuse to work anywhere near this place.  My ideal job would be something simple yet mildly intellectual, such as a clerk at a book or computer store.  Ah, yes, being around computers all day and getting paid for it certainly sounds like a good deal to me!  ..Now I just have to find a place like that that will hire a soon to be 16.5 year old teenager..

       Tomorrow my original history teacher comes back to school; it's going to be quite different..  With Mrs. J, the class was out of control (but I liked it that way! XD).  She had absolutely no authority over the class whatsoever.  Here's a perfect example:   Mrs. J: *in Kaylee's face* GO TO THE OFFICE NOWWWWWW!!!!!  Kaylee: I'M NOT GOING TO NO OFFICE!!!!!!  Mrs. J: Fine.  Then sit there and do your work.  Pathetic, eh?  At least she was a nice person and threw out a lot of amusing quotes for me to write down.  "Who's autistic in here?!?!"  "If you don't answer, I'm going to burn you with a cigarette!!"  "...You guys are funny and funny-lookin'..."  Ah, the memories.  I will hold them fondly in my palm forever.

       Today was fun.  I started off by playing the sims for a while (but I'm NOT going to rave on about that anymore today), and then in the late afternoon I went over to John's house and we went biking and swimming with Sean, too.  My bike broke, though, but luckily John was able to fix it and now it's back to normal.  Things got weird when I got home, though.  Just...people online I'm talking to...it's put me in a rather unpleasant mood, though I won't mention any names.  Currently, I am about to eat a ham sandwich with lettuce and mustard on pita bread and have a glass of ice water.

       Ok, tonight we are going to the Roxy to see The Alamo.  It doesn't look as if it will be one of my favorite movies, but I'll go see it.  Historical movies usually don't spark my interest.  Then again, neither did history class in school.  I've never been to Roxy before, so I guess it will be an experience for me.  Check out "The Alamo" at: http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&cf=info&id=1808402862&intl=us

       A beautiful sunny morning on a not-so-Father's Day.  Amazingly I got up around 8:30 and was showered and dressed by 9, which is certainly a rarity in the summer for me.  Yesterday was the car show in Palmerton, as one of my friends called it, "the greatest day in Palmerton all year".  So, I picked up Kurt around 2 then drove to John's.  Our group of five (Kurt, John, Sean, Pete, and myself) then walked down to the park and checked out all of the cars.  We went back to John's for a while because there really wasn't much else to do until nightfall.  In the evening we went to Joe's Place to eat.  I ordered a Zimmerman's Iced Tea and a Jumbo Fry.  Then we walked down to the park again, talked for a while, and impatiently waited for the flamethrower contest to begin.  In total, I think there were 5 cars participating in the flamethrower contest.  It was amazing; some of the flames coming out of the backs of the cars were nearly as tall as some of the buildings.  When the flames would emerge near where I was standing, I could literally feel the heat blasting against my face.  After the contest, there was the "neon light show", where the cars showed off their cool and/or blinky lights.  As for today?  I'm not really sure yet.  Yesterday John was talking about us doing something today, and I really hope that we do, because I know I'll be bored out of my mind in a few hours.  I wouldn't mind going to the pool, even though it's a cooler than usual day today.  So, I'm not sure what I'm doing today, but hopefully I won't be home all day.  Update on job search status:  I applied to a total of 4 places since May.  Pencor, Joe's, IGA, and MicroPack(?).  Pencor has not even called me since May, so I'm assuming that they are not going to.  I have decided that I do not want to work at Joe's any more.  So, I am really hoping that IGA or the other one hires me.

       Last night was fun.  Kurt came over and we watched American Wedding, which was hilarious, and then we went on AIM and continued our "contest".  Our contest is to see who is 'hotter' by sending random girls in aol chatrooms our pictures and having them decide.  As of right now, I believe we are tied, but only if you don't count the gay man's vote for Kurt. :D  This weekend is going to be very nice.  Sunny and pleasant temperatures in the 70's.  The morning is a bit chilly, but that's ok.  I might call up Martin and ask if he wants to go see Troy with me tonight.  And tomorrow I might hang out with John and Kurt if they're not busy.  Currently I am wearing my hoodie and enjoying the nice weather.

       I hate children.  I hate annoying children.  I hate annoying children on my property.  I REALLY hate annoying children on my property disturbing me.  Let me explain the tirade.  Some children from the neighborhood decided to play an odd little game that seemed similar to kickball.  However, the spot they chose to play it in was the extremely narrow space between my house and the house next door.  Therefore, whenever they would kick the ball, it would very hardly bounce off the sides of my house and the next house.  This is PART of what annoyed the hell out of me.  Every minute there would be a huge thump on my house because of that ball.  BUT, also, the children had the nerve to shamelessly use water from my house's spicket!  So I would hear the water running every 5 minutes!  Hmmm....what should I do to get these children away?  Sure, I could have probably went outside to yell at them, but then again, since they have such piss-poor attitudes and the intellect of a tadpole, I assumed it would just be wasting my time and dignity to go out there.  So, time to pretend to be an adult in need of anger-management! :D  Yes, since they can't see me through the blinds, they don't know who the hell I am as long as I don't speak, right?  To start off, I just opened the window, so that they would realize that someone was indeed in the house.  They continued to play.  I sighed and went back in my room for a while, continuing to clean it.  They went away after a bit, and I was very glad.  I finished cleaning and got in the shower.  As I turn off the water, what do you think I hear again....yes, the children and their odd little game again.  I quickly dry off and put on the nearest clothes I can find, run out to the kitchen, and SLAM the window as hard as I could.  They continued to play.  At this point I was absolutely furious, so I slammed my bedroom door at full might.  They still continued to play for another 2 minutes approximately, but then they left again, thank GOD.  Now, if they come back, I'm just going to repeatedly slam doors until they go away. :D  God, I hate children.

       Last day of school; I'm officially a junior now. :D  Also, I'll NEVER have to take the bus to school again.  I drove home today and I'll be driving myself to school and home all of next year because I'm getting my license and a car this summer.  Yeah!  Right now it's really hot, like 95 degrees or so.  I love this weather, though.  I WAS going to go to the pool with my friends, but of course they changed their minds because "it was too hot".  Now that school's over I have so much free time; I love it.  Also I won't need to wake up at 6:05 any more, thank God.  I was gonna get "Hello" software so I could post pictures on my blog, but I was waay too lazy and the favorite has been deleted, so just forget about that idea.  I wanna go outside somewhere today, so when my Mom gets home hopefully I can drive somewhere for icecream or something.  I just want to be outside in this hot weather; I love it.  Currently I am filling out my application and sipping ice water.

       Today's been so far a great day for me mostly  6:05 a.m. -- Wakes up to radio after obtaining approximately 5 hours of sleep.  Eyes = burning.  7:02 a.m. -- Off to school..  We got back our quiz that we took yesterday on a movie (who the fuck gives a quiz the day before the final exam?!).  My esteem was brought down for a bit when I received the same grade as Brian on it..  By the way, the final was easy. ;)  As for math, even simpler.  I aced that final.  A or better, nearly guaranteed. ;)  11:something -- Got home, had a glass of water, went online.  Going out to eat with my friends soon then ...?  Dunno what the rest of the day holds.  Maybe I'll blog about it later if I'm not feeling too lazy.  Currently I am sitting here shirtless.

       Wow, its been a while.  I guess I've been too lazy to update lately, but I'm in a blogging mood, so time for a new post.  Where to begin..where to begin..  In early July, I began working at a Steak/Hoagie shop near my house.  Its not the greatest of job, but at least I'm getting money; that's the only reason I haven't quit yet.  Most of the people are nice, but the job is just very annoying at times and I really don't think working with food is for me, since before this, I haven't even gotten past using the microwave at home.  I passed my driver's test on July 30th and got my license!  I've been driving so much since then.  Today I'm driving to Martin's house to hang out up there for a while.  The car will officially become mine before school starts!  I'm really excited for that.  My Mom will be getting a new car and then I'll be getting the current car.  But I need my job so that I'll be able to help pay off this one.  All of my money has gone into my checking account for the car; I haven't spent anything I've made from work.  But, this will all pay off when I have my own car and will be driving to school this year.  No more bus for me, thank GOD!  Anyway, that's about it.  I know, not too much, but its summer, and I can't remember every little detail of my life between June 20-something and now.  Currently I am eating a scrambled-egg fahita and drinking a glass of orange juice with precisely two ice cubes.
