         For those of you who don't know, Jessica Simpson has launched a new line of cosmetics called "Dessert Beauty".  All of the products in the line are edible and smell delicious!  The line includes items like Dessert Beauty Powdered Sugar Body Shimmer with Feather, Dessert Beauty Deliciously Kissable Body Topping, Dessert Beauty Whipped Body Dessert with Candy Sprinkles (my personal favorite!), and Dessert Beauty Cream Puff Lip-Plumping Treat.  Love her or hate her, you'll have to admit that her new line is divine!  Learn more at:  urlLink http://www.dessertbeauty.com  The line is also available at Sephora.

         Hey Ladies...just a warning that there is only 1 week left for the Victoria's Secret Semi-Annual Sale!  This is definitely one of the best sales around.  Signature bras and panties are 25-50% off, and clearance items will cost you anywhere from $2.99 (for panties) and $9.99 and up for bras.  Every Diva needs to have at LEAST one very sexy underwear combo, and with this sale there's no excuse not too!  Start shopping at: http://www.victoriassecret.com urlLink
