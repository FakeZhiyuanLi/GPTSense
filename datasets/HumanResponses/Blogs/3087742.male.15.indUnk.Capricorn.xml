       There is no way of telling whether or not the POTC trilogy will be good, until they come out. &nbsp;

       I'm not saying that Disney trilogys suck, I'm saying that most trilogys tend to be not as popular as the original, even ones that everyone thinks will be good. For example,  The Matrix  was a ground breaking film, when news got out that there would be a trilogy, everyone got excited. Then the movies came out and the Wachowski brothers' credibility was flushed down the toilet as the movies.... sucked. That is an example of a great movie with trilogys that&nbsp;weren't as good.  Back to the Future  was a book, but they were written at different times, so&nbsp;the key issues of the&nbsp;story changes. But actually,  Back to the Future II  was good, the third messed up on one of the major issues, Don't take it too far, which is what happened, the story went from time jumping to stuck.  Star Wars  the movie was made first then the books were made.   *cough cough* Your kinda missing the point,&nbsp; Lord or the Rings &nbsp;was only good because it was written at the same time by the same person. The actors do not make the story, they tell it.

      LOTR made it because it was a good series that won the heart and souls of cridics, directors, fans - you name it.&nbsp; The last one won 11 oscars, 11 !!!!!&nbsp; LOTR was a good series with good actors and a great setup.

      Yes but you have to understand that for people that like disney had to have closure.&nbsp; the whole story of Aladdin is this boy that is alone in the world.&nbsp; The second one had to introduce the genie again and also had to settle the isuee of Jafar.&nbsp; We find out very little about aladdin, so all the aladdin fans had to know about his past, the third and final one.&nbsp; And disney will soon be comming out with a new trilogy... POTC.&nbsp; And if disney trilogys stink then it must refer to the future of POTC and that refers to the first one. Which, as you know, dissing POTC (even future potc) could make you end up mangled and demented and, well not living.&nbsp; Back to the future was a good trilogy and was also based on a book, i believe- so was star wars, and books are always better than movies.

      Debate, eh? Bring it...   You really&nbsp;think so? I'm not a Disney fan,&nbsp;not of the new stuff, anyway. The original Aladdin was good, but it made the fatal error that  Back to the Future  made. Making a&nbsp;trilogy. No trilogy has ever lasted, aside from  Star Wars  and&nbsp;  Lord of the Rings.&nbsp;Lord of the Rings  only lasted&nbsp;because, first of all, it was a book, and secondly, it was written as one book, but had to be separated for printing purposes.

      10. It was a pretty good movie, I don't remember any kimono scene, but the fact that they tried to make a TV series out of it ruined it for me,  9. Lion King 1 1/2? Never saw it, but it probably was good.  8. Never saw it again, but antagonist of fire? That doesn't sound like a plot-filled movie.  7. Inuyasha rocks, plain and simple, I'm not too far in the series though. By the way in japanese, hen means strange, hentai means sexually strange/perverted and ecchi is a stronger version of hentai. Unfortunatly, they also have double meanings, meanings that go along with their real meanings. Anyway if you liked InuYasha, you'd love Ranma 1/2, a manga also by Rumiko Takahashi. Ranma and InuYasha have the same voice actor in English and Japanese.   6. Saw this twice so far... Good movie. Docter Octavious rules  .    &nbsp; 5. An interesting movie, but I don't like Steven King that much. His writing is too dark. A stunning preformance by Johnny Depp. Love the scene were he finally goes crazy and talks to himself.  4. Aladdin was alright, there should not have been a trilogy.  3.LOTR, always good, doesn't stick to the book though.  2.Two Towers, Same, didn't stick to the book. Tree Beard stole one of Tom Bombadil's lines.  1.POTC, that's what I thought. It was a very awesome movie.

      Top 10 Movies  with comentary from Weird Kendo Guy    &nbsp; 10.&nbsp; My Big Fat Greek Wedding -&nbsp;  this was one of the best romantic comedys I have ever seen.&nbsp; The whole Greek theme was awsome.&nbsp; I love the windex and the kimono scenes.&nbsp; This movie was well writen and is a family favorite.     &nbsp; 9. Lion King 1 1/2  - This was sooo great.&nbsp; I have always wondered&nbsp;about&nbsp;Timon and Pumbaa.&nbsp; I like the original songs, xpecially the "dig a tunnel" one.&nbsp; The way the scriptwriters&nbsp;injected things into the original movie&nbsp;was&nbsp;planed well.&nbsp; This, like the former, is a great family movie.&nbsp; Go Disney!  &nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Backdraft  -&nbsp; The story of two brothers overcoming life and fire.&nbsp; This is a touching story that takes fire and turns it into a villan.&nbsp; Kurt Russel does and awsome job.&nbsp; The&nbsp;plot twists&nbsp;and romance make the story.&nbsp; Besides the cursing, this movie is awsome and ...well...awsome!  &nbsp; 7.&nbsp; Inuyasha Movies&nbsp; -&nbsp;I could&nbsp;"sit"(ha ha) and watch&nbsp;these all day long.&nbsp; They are clasic anime and are very cool.&nbsp; You learn a ton about the Japanese language like hoshi means monk and&nbsp;hentai means perverted ^_^.&nbsp; Also you learn valuble lessons about love, that no matter how much you love sombody, you can still be overpowerd by evil deamons&nbsp;from china and&nbsp;try to kill your&nbsp;love with your bow and arrow.  &nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Spiderman 2  - This was so much better than the first one.&nbsp; MJ and Peter's best friend find out who he is and so does an entire train car.&nbsp; it has a ton more action and the kooky news person is back.&nbsp; I dont want to say to much&nbsp;just in case.  &nbsp; 5. Secret Window  - Stephen King at his worst. This was a good story.&nbsp; Why i say, "SK at his worst" is that he made Johnny Depp&nbsp;a mass murderer.&nbsp; I liked the fact that the only bad word that&nbsp;was said is&nbsp;"ship" with a t instead of a p.&nbsp; I liked the plot twist at the end, evern though it was different than the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who played John Shooter was AWSOME!&nbsp;&nbsp;He really was freaky.&nbsp; All in all a good movie.    &nbsp; 4. Aladdin  - This&nbsp;is the&nbsp;best disney movie ever.&nbsp; I know all the&nbsp;songs by heart.&nbsp; Robin Williams is&nbsp;the best genie ever!&nbsp;&nbsp;And eago is the greatest parrot ever.&nbsp; GO DISNEY!!!!    &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Lord of the Rings: The&nbsp;Retern of the King  -&nbsp;In my opinion this was long.&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved all the action and the fact that it was over.&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning was...odd.&nbsp; I loved it though.&nbsp; The special effects were awsome and i like the dead people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Billy Boyd&nbsp; and Viggo can sing really&nbsp;good.&nbsp; It is LOTR, therefore it is awsome!    &nbsp; 2. Lord of the Rings: The two Towers  - The fact that&nbsp;this was in the middle made it wonderful.&nbsp; Smeigle is awsome!&nbsp; Once again special effects were great.&nbsp; We get to learn&nbsp;more about the characters&nbsp;which makes our compasion for them flourish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees are great and the intro of feromer (cant spell) is splendid.    &nbsp; 1. Pirates of the&nbsp;Carribean  - This is the best movie&nbsp;ever... nough said!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Here's a good quote,  some lyrics from one of my favorite Five Iron Frenzy songs.      "When I was young, the smallest trick of light,   Could catch my eye,   Then life was new and every new day,   I thought that I could fly.   I believed in what I hoped for,   And I hoped in things unseen.   I had wings and dreams could soar,   I just don't feel like flying anymore.      When stars threw down their spears,   Watered heaven with their tears,   Before words were spoken,   Before eternity.      Dear Father, I need you,   Your strength my heart to mend,   I want to fly higher,   Every new day again"   -Every New Day (Our Newest Album Ever)

      A little joke.  "An old man living alone on a farm wrote to his only son, Bubba, in prison.  Dear Bubba:  I'm feeling pretty bad because it looks like i won't be able to plant my potato garden this year.  i'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot.  wish you were here--i know you would take care of it for me. Love, dad.  About a week later the farmer received this letter. 'dead dad: don't dig up the garden! that's where i buried the bodies! love, bubba.'  the next morning, fbi agents stormed the property and dug up the entire garden. they didn't find any bodies, though, so they apologized to the old man and left.  soon the farmer received another letter. 'dear dad: go ahead and plant the potatoes now. it's the best i can do under the circumstances. love, bubba."           -reader's digest

      Why Computers Sometimes Crash! By Dr. Seuss. (Read this aloud to yourself, - it's great!)    If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort, and the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.  If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, and the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash, then your situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash!   If the label on the cable on the table at your house, says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, but your packets want to tunnel to another protocol, that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.   And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss, so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse; then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, 'cuz sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang.  When the copy on your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk, and the macro code instructions all are causing undue risk, then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM, and then turn off the computer and be sure to tell your Mom!   I thought this was funny and it was sent to me by Shannon.  Who would have thunk this was made by Dr. seuss

      Amanda, in reading your post on my post i say that Figure C said "you love him" not "he loves you". Get that right Figure A. Geez!!! Also, when figure A went up to biology, Figures B and C had a good time talking about how figure D (the squid) is dead and does not feel anything, therefore, figure A should not be squimish of disectinf Figure D. Also Figure C commented to Figure B that she had to watch Figure E (shannon/Bio partner) disect Figure F( the live worm) and how when it was halfway cut open the heart was still beating. Figure B was astonished to learn that our bio clas had disected Figure F and then he went into his german classroom. PLEASE DO NOT KILL FIGURE C  also, this is the best acronymph.  F- Freaked Out  I- Insecure  N- Nerotic  E- Emotional  Never bealeive a person is doing good if they say "Fine"

      Jenn!  in reading your post i must say one thing, figure A does not know if figure B feels the same way!  he could just think figure A is crazy!  especially after what happened today, miss figure C.  for everyone else, figure C completely screamed "he loves you!" when figure B was right behind us. figure C is a wild one, and i am sure all you californians know this.  who knows what crazy thing she'll do next to mess up my lack of love life.  her and another jen were even plotting to do what jenn did in the steve and christine situation.  i'm doomed.

      jenn and i have often referred to ourselves as hobbits, and i was lately contemplating the subject  and of course leading myself in ringlets as tight as my own head's.  being short is usually thought of by figure A, the short one, as being bad.  you cannot reach the high shelves at giant eagle, and you need to look up to everyone.  but those in the catagory of figure B, the tall one, tall is bad. you dwarf even your boyfriend, (of one i wish i had) (Jenn don't comment) (i'll get to this) and you must look down.  except if figure B is a boy, in which case, tall is excellent.  then i decided i rather like being short.  sure, just 2 inches and i would feel a lot happier, but (and think abt it) i don't want to look down to this so called imaginary boyfriend. i like him taller than me, and this is where i twist myself into the ringlet. figure A, the short one, happens to maybe like figure B, the tall one who figure A likes.  yea.  but figure C, the even shorter one, is trying to, hmm, convince figure A to, hmm, do a sydney carton.  which is where i throw myself into the total ringlet, because i am back to thinking short is good.  which by the way my view on this my be slightly twisted because figure B has commented on the shortness of figure A in a cute way.  yea i am crazy, but it's allright.  it's just tale of 2 cities-itis.

      I found this quote on the internet and i thought it was hilarious.  Comments at end.  Has having children [he has a girl and boy] changed Johnny Depp?   "Oh yeah. I would say that the kiddies give you strength. The kiddies give you strength and perspective and you understand stuff. Things that would've made me sort of upset or angry before, or things about Hollywood, things in magazines or paparazzi or stuff like that, now you can sort of really go, 'Oh, shove off. I'm just going to play Barbies with my daughter."-Johnny Depp   Hahahahahahahaha!!!!! @_@  I love this.  What is so funny is picturing in your mind Depp sitting on the floor with his daughter playing barbies and being yelled at for not putting the shoe on right or something like that.  I remember when i played with barbies with my daddy and yelling him for not putting the clothes on right or not doing what i wanted him to do.  Those were the days, playing with barbies and telling your parents what to do and having them obey instead of sending you to your room.  *sigh*  anyway yea i thought that this was funny.

      I am reading A Tale of Two Cities for english, AJ is in my class.  I am thinking about how Jack Sparrow could be a reincarnation of Sydney Carton.  They are both drunks, both are very witty.  Also they are loners.  This, i think will get me personaly interested in reading the story more cause of the likeness between the two.  I love this.

      How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?  Such number as  may be deemed necessary to perform the stated task in a timely and  efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement.    Whereas the party of the first part, also known as 'the lawyers' and the party of the second part,  also known as 'the light bulb' do hereby agree to a  transaction wherein the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be   removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform  previously agreed upon duties, i.e. the lighting, elucidation, and  otherwise illumination of the area ranging from the front (North) door,  through the entryway, terminating at an area just through the primary living  area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover  illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (light bulb)  and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.  The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited  to, the following steps: 1.    The party of the first part (lawyer)  shall, with or without elevation at his option, by means of a chair, step  stool, ladder or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the  second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light  bulb) in a counter clockwise direction, said direction being  non-negotiable.  Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (light  bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (lawyer) to  maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (light  bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the  second part (light bulb) to perform the customary and agreed upon  duties.  The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that  structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be  ncidental to the aforementioned failure to perform and in such case  the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such  structural failure insofar as the non-negotiable directional codicil  (counter-clockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer)   throughout.  2. Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part  (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part  ('receptacle'), the party of the first part shall have the option of disposing  of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with  all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.    3. Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer)  shall have the option of beginning the installation of the party of the  fourth part ('new light bulb').  This installation shall occur in a  manner consistent with the reverse procedures described in step one of  this self same document, being careful to note that the rotation should   occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable  and only until the party of the fourth part (new light bulb) becomes  snug in the party of the third part (receptacle) and in fact becomes the  party of the second part (light bulb).  Note: The above described steps  may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part   (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), or by his or her heirs and  assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him or her to do sum  the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate  vicinity of the aforementioned front (North) door consistent with  maximization of ingress and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also  known as 'The Firm'.  I thought that this was hillarious.  i dont know about you but this wa really great.  Also i would like to stray away from this happy and light hearted note to make a rant.  Yes, a rant, this is the first rant and it is a Biology rant.  Tommorow i have to disect a worm and that is fine and dandy with me casue certain people at my table will do it. But anyway, I am probably going to be made to disect it anyway.  You may be thinking that that is no big deal.  its just a dead worm that smells bad cause it has been soaked in fermaldahid.  Well, you are sooooo wrong.  We are disecting a live worm, yes ladies and gentleman a live worm!!! This is horrable because when we open the worm its heart will be still beating and its lungs will be working and it will be grose. I mean come on, why disect a live worm.  And with that, why disect a wom at all.  It it a worm for pete sake.  A little worm.  LET THE WORMS RUN FREE!!! That is what i have to say.  DO NOT TORCHER THE POOR THINGS.  Plus that is just sickening.  anyway, we have a biology test on the worm also.  GRRRRRRRR!!!

      I dont feel like writing anything.  Yet that is how it is in life, you find something to do and you dont want to do it.  Then you just do it anyway because you have nothing better to do.  I wonder why that is.  Are we so wrapped up in our own choices that we forget what we want and dont want?  I have no idea?

      I have just come up with one of the coolist things.    IT IS FUN TO BE WIERD.  Wierd people are not held up to0 any standers like nerds or jocks or criminal juvaniles, we are just wacky and crazy.  We do the stuff we do to be who we are, the funny and somewhat sarcastic people we are.  We are here, not to make a lasting impression on the world, but to have fun and be content and take risks.  That is maybe why we are considered "wierd".  It is because we are not the Jocks who are strong, we are not the nerds who do nothing but figure out sqare roots or are in trigonometry in 9th grade, we are not the criminal juvaniles who do anything to get noticed.  We are ourselves and because we are ourselves we are wierd or freaks.  Yet, we hope that one of these years the Jocks and all other types of cliches in schools will relize that they can be freaks and wierd people and bring that out, then the world would be not only crazy, but a good kind of crazy.  Sorry, i just had a wierd moment.  please xcuse.  "NI" (mwahahahaha)

      This is one of the best quotes in the world and i love it cause it describes me. It is by my main man Johnny Depp. Well, not main man cause The main man is Jesus Christ and one other guy that means a lot to me but, back to Johnny Depp, who I could lavish over for millions and millions of years but i will not succumb to that level...yet (mwahahahahahaha) As you can probably see buy the evil laughing that i am showing on my blog, i am not normal. Yet nobody is normal which makes the world very...well...odd. So insted of my useless rambling, i guess i should deliver my quote.  " There seems to be a constant theme in things I do which deal with people who are considered "freaks" by so-called "normal" people. I guess that would make me a “freak”. Awsome!" -Johnny Depp  I love this quote because it relates to the very astonishingly wierd person that is sitting at the computer. i have no idea who she is...well i do but, yea you get the point. Well i say adu till next time we meet, or talk, or you just read my stupid little bablings without seeing or hearing me but through the passings of my small and scary but non the less full functioning mind to you. (Mwahahahahaha) I make myself laugh. And in the world of me an a few other ppl i say "NI" just to be utterly bizzar.

      Amanda, i totaly relate.  My friend krystina (whom i met in 2nd grade) still lives in california.  At least you get to see them once in awhile and you live in the same state.  And David, ive known him since i was 9.  All my friends are 3852ish miles away.  I can only talk to them on wekends because i get free minutes on my cell phone.  Sal, i like calling you sal better than zack.  no offence to your birth name.  And the comment was very sappy but that is what boyfriends are for.  Women like to hear sappy things, it makes the feel supirior.  Amanda may agree or disagree.

      Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with you (sappy i know, but o well...deal with it).  I know how it is to lose a best friend too, it's impossible to replace them.  But trust me your nowhere near the bottom of the social standings (trust me I live there :-)  And besides you have all of your new friends at Seneca to make fun of you...uh... i mean make you happy now.  Sorry sarcasm slip (SSS or S^3)

      fig b, your controbutions to this blog are amazing. haveing the reda-isms inserted brings new life to sarcasm. (jenn, did u put him up to it? no wait, dont' bother answering, i know what it'll be).  anyway....i just wanted to comment on that.  oh, and i think i figured out what wrong w/ me (jenndon'tcomment i know its more than one thing). but...i think i am suffering from friend deprivation. i know i gots tons of frineds at our school, but i cna't help but miss my best friend and my other really close frineds. how crazy is that.  its also kinda major pitiful, but think abt it. if u were best friends w/ the same person for 9 years, u would miss her too! but maybe its' just commonly confused words-itis.

      Here it is.  By popular demand.  (Insert drumroll here)  The rebellion against Miss Reda.  For those of you who don't know who Miss Reda is imagine the Wicked Witch of the West in normal clothes minus the green skin and the house on her head.  Crag-A steeply projecting mass of rock. The crag fell on Miss Reda's head. Reda Comment: lovely  Shroud-A cloth used to wrap a body for burial. The shroud concealed Miss Reda's body after getting hit with a crag. Reda Comment: um, yikes  Apocryphal-Of questionalbe authorship or authenticity Jagoffs in our class think Miss Reda has apocryphal authority. Reda Comment: None  Sagacity-Shrewd and wise; wisdom Those jagoffs think that it is an act of sagacity put on by Miss Reda.  Reda over all comment: not funny  For some reason I got points off for inappropriate content.....

      I have a revelation to share.  If Amanda is Sydney Carton does that make Sal the Seamstress?  I am so glad that you two are together, i will be in peace.  I have that water bottle for you sal!  And Amanda, how do you like your administrative position?  Its good to be in charge, i am usually not in charge much cause i dominate or i become crazy and cant get a thing done or come up with wierd ideas.  Another Revelation.  It is said that the ppl of other countries drive on the wroreng side of the road.  That would mean that we drive on the right side of the road.  But if we are a small minority compared to them than are we wrong.  But if we are right then the majority or popular vote dosent count.  And if the popular vote dosent count, then i have twisted myself into a slinky (if you do not know what a slinky is than i will feel old).  The slinky is that if the popular vote dosent count and people are going to go against the majority anyways then why vote.  But getting back to the whole driving thing ... mailmen, here they drive on the wrong side of the road so do mailmen of other countries (that have mailmen of course) drive on the right side of the road, but then the whole thing comes back about the popular vote and stuff.  ITS JUST ONE BIG NEVERENDING CIRCLE OF CRAZYNESS!!!!!

         well, shannon, nothing was going on today. he was being particularly amusing is all. and by the way, what "show" did u plan to see? and what abt whyt didi he walk down the staris? i dunno what u do in california, but here that's what stairs are for. (lol).      and u think i should tell him.  hmmm. i actually probably will soon, b/c i almost went crazy when he was on the band trip. think of me during summer if we didin't do stuff together.

      Okay, AJ, what happened with figure B today? I was expecting a show!!! And then he just walks up, the two of you lock gazes, and he keeps walking down the stairs! But why? I got out of reminding Nikki about going to the library for   that?    I think you should just tell a particular figure everything that has been going on already. This particular figure has a dire need to know and doesn't even realize it.

      AJ, I don't recall ever saying that   dentists   were  Sith spawn. (I really do avoid saying "Spawn of Satan," but Sith isn't so bad, really. I mean, anyone could become a sith!) I'm just of the opinion that   orthodontists   are the real sithspawns.   With dentists, it's not so bad. It's the same thing time after time: scraping your teeth, jabbing down in molars with the hooky thing, pressing nasty stuff into your mouth, etc. But orthodontists, that's another story. Let's just say that you don't usually take two ibuprofin before arriving at the dentist's door. It's practically a given for the othodude's.   Also, though the dentist sticks metal in your mouth, (s)he usually takes most of it out again. (Fillings aren't metal anymore, right?) I mean, it's not like you have to relearn how to eat, drink, and speak after two hours at the dentist's. And you don't have to put scented wax over dental work like you have to when you have pokey things sticking out from your teeth. ("Oh, you'll get used to it. It's not so bad, really.")  Well, let me just share one of my reviews for "Jonas, Anubis, and Your Local Orthodontist". This person sums everything up:  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this story. I had a 2 hour ortho appt. earlier today and I'm rather pissed at them. I've had the expander along with this evil thing called a herbst appliance that has now broken TWICE. I was in a really bad mood, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this story. And for anyone out there about to get braces, or anything of the type, if your doctor says you won't need pain meds, smile and nod and take them as soon as possible. AWESOME story. ~Amanda  Yeah, ff.net. Gotta love them people!  I guess my point is this: dentists aren't so bad compared to the othodontists, who are trying to take over the world.  (By the way, there is now no doubt in anyone's mind that I love writing, correct?)

      to all concerned... figure b is back from the band trip and i found out he wears glasses! i am gonna havee to wear mine one day to school to make sure he knows how dorky i really am in glasses. (trust me, it's bad)anyway i am sure you do not want to hear abt my raving so here's what i came to say.  i used to think shannon was way overboard wiht the whole "dentist is spawn of satan", but i had ot experience the torture on saturday, at 9 am no less! i did not enjoy metal objects being mercilessly shoved into my mouth, and when she said "open" i was so surprised i did and she shoved fluoride into my mouth. you know, the big teeth shaped foam thing that tastes awful?! yucK! it's a fact dentists have the largest suicide rate of all professions. i know if i were one i would so totaly jump off a bridge.

       urlLink Technically, this is written on the same day as my last post, but I didn't want to mess up the prettifulness and seriousness of my... sermon. I just want to share one of my favorite quotes from some really smart person still alive in Germany.     urlLink "Kann es sein, dass man die Vergangenheit veraendern muss, damit die Zukunft so existiert, wie wir sie kennen?" Literally, word for word, it says, "Can it be, that one the past change must, by it the future so exists, how we it know?" So for anyone who wants to learn something, it means,   "Can it be that one must change the past, that by changing it, the future exists in the way we know it?"      urlLink  That is such a philosophical-ish-y quote! Now. For those of you who like Stargate (a bit of free advertising on my part, if I may?), check out the stuff, especially Reeses (AJ?), at the following site which actually consists of this whole post except for the German quote.

      Yay! After so long, I've finally been able to join! Okay, to comment on everything I missed... Yeah, I've never seen this blog before in my life, so...    April 2   Hey, wierdkendogirl, if JD's your main man (besides Christ), who are all the others that   aren't   your main men? .... Wierd Kendo Guy...? -- WKG, you make yourself out to be such an insane person! I mean, even you will admit that Bloom and I greatly surpass your mere social abnormailities. At least you seem to take true pleasure in AJ's gossip.    April 3   Hey, look, more ranting for tired eyes. I think I may just go check e-mail and come back to this later, but I've missed out on so much!    April 5   Whoa, philosophical-ish-y stuff! W-ay too tired for that!    April 7   Did I send you that e-mail or did you send it to me? I distinctly remember reading that. And then IMing it to you.    April 15   Excuse me, but figure C didn't ask figure A to pull a Sydney Carton, which is what all Jack/Sam shippers (Stargate fanficdom) want Pete Shannahan to pull. You see, if figure A pulled a Sydney Carton, he/she would confess his/her  love and devotion (and constant thoughts) to figure B so that figure C, who doesn't really give a .... about figure B except where it relates to figure A, could forever be with figure B and make figure B happy, but that's not the case. So figure A should just walk right up to figure B the moment he/she sees her/him back from Myrtle Beach (where he is currently physically near/within ten miles of figure... figure... J!!!) and confess excactly how he/she feels for her/him. JUST DO IT! FIGURE B PROBABLY KNOWS ALREADY!!! Besides, when this event finally occurs, we can move on to someone else and get off your back, figure A.    April 17   So said some people. It just relates. (Sorry kendoguy!) Men were made first. Therefore, they are the rough draft.    May 3   Mexico? Cool! You mean you've actually been to other countries? I went to Canada once for half an hour and the Bahamas for two or three hours, but nothing extensive! That sounds so awesome!    May 6   Okay, AJ, I'm ready to come out with the full story. Y'all haven't heard it. Only a few people know. Nikki, maybe Lisa, probably Lindsay, my mom, and that's about it. So I'll get this over with.   Seventh grade. There was a guy in my purpose reading class *not history* that I kinda liked. He was a smart kid, knew a lot about robotics and computers, and was a major scifi fan. I mean, this guy could probably give you detailed directions on which hallways to take to get from engineering to the infirmary on any Enterprise, 14xx, 1701, A, B, C, D, maybe even E. Anyway, we got along well. A few times, I got up the courage to actually talk to him. He talked back. We had some pleasant conversations. (Keep in mind, figure C, I was just as prejudiced/biased/whatever against teenage relationships as I am now.) So we talked some more. Exchanged e-mail addresses. Then one day, he gave me this note with a cat on it, e-mail, phone number, and a few words. I don't remember what it was, but I still know exactly where it is. (And   definately   not in the garbage!!!) So he dropped by my house a few times since the two of us both lived in the same town. Gave me stuff. Hockey equipment, chocolate, etc. Kept it up for a while. We'd talk on the way out of the building. Then he wrote me this nasty e-mail one day. I got mad at him, avoided him and he me.   Remember I said that he was good with computers? My friends got nasty messages   from my e-mail account   that I had never written. The anger mounts. I forgot about it for a while. At or around the beginning of eighth grade, I realized the whole deal was kind of worthless. We could still have been friends. After all, we both liked scifi, right? Nope. I e-mailed him one last time, asking what his problem was. And he replied that he had used me, a ploy for popularity, apparently. I guess when he realized it wouldn't work, he blew off the idea. Well, ... *nasty words rising in mind, of several different languages* I've got several nicknames for him, including baka, shol'vah (appropriate), and scheissekopf. (I'll change that if it offends anyone besides this guy.)   It's kinda funny, not like I didn't have any foreshadowing. The guy's name was Peter M. I had a neighbor in SC with the same name. (Different last name, but same last initial.) I'd been friends with the SC Peter until we were around five. Then I guess it was "uncool" to be friends with a girl, so he was an idiot. I mentioned this to the other Peter, who commented that he hoped the same thing wouldn't happen again. Scheisse. I think it's kinda ironic that the good baka on Stargate is named Pete.   Oh, what I meant to tell you at lunch, figure A? I was going to comment that during all that time, all I could think about was Peter. What Peter would think. What Peter would like. When I would next see Peter. I guess I'm just trying to say that no matter how much you think you know him, no matter how much you think you like him, it can all turn around. Maybe you guys haven't noticed; as far as I know, your parents are still together. But you have to wonder how two people can love eachother so much that they get married, have a child, stay married for almost twenty-five years and then get divorced and detest eachother. How is something like that possible? Is the human heart so frail that even the strongest emotions can reverse so quickly?   This is all easy to take for granted, read over, feel sorry for me. (Don't do that, by the way. I don't need it yet. Maybe I'll tell you if I do.) But you have to see that it's the same here. The same beginnings of the throwing of the same dice. Just know that there may be more riding on the gamble than you think.

      i just wanted to give major major kudos here to jenn and david.  whoever said absence makes the heart grow fonder had some serious mental issues.  sure it does, but it just about kills you in the process.  i mean, figure b is busy on his band trip, AT THE OCEAN, and i am sitting here contemplating the many ways to survive until monday. yep jenn commented (or asked, as the case may be) how i would feel if i did tell fig b i liked him, we were together, and then i was whipped away to the other side of the country.  after much contemplation of this subject, i have decided i am very proud of jenn for not a)exploding  b)going crazy  or c)taking the next plane back to california.  oh well.  just thought i'd give kudos to the two of you. and find some outlet for missing the object of my affections, but that cannot be helped.  i need a life. or a boyfriend. (jenn dont' comment). i will do something this after he gets back. i can't stand it any longer. sorry for all who have had to read this. i promise i am not always this stupid. but don't consult jenn on that.  she'd disagree.

      SARAH:   You consider it dishonorable to attack enemies from the back, and yet you don't consider it dishonorable to manipulate someone else's mind? What kind of person are you? I suppose you already answered that.   Your hobbies include stealing and fighting? That's it? Don't you have anything better to do? Can't you browse the internet for something more... fulfilling... than that?

        USER PROFILE    Hello, I'm Kuronue.  A strange sadistic demon from Kurama's controversial past who is actually kind of gothic.  I have bat wings and wear mostly black clothes.  Like I said, I'm from Kurama's past.  In fact, I was his partner before I met a terrible fate while fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  My hobbies are stealing and fighting.  I use scythe and a pendant that I never cast away to manipulate my opponent's mind and make them believe whatever I wish them to believe.  Of course, I also just use the scythe.  And just to diminish any worries, I don't attack enemies from the rear.  It's very dishonorable.

        USER PROFILE    NAME: Sarah Anderson  I'm a twenty-five year old gal living in Colorado Springs. I have a black husky mix named Imperial Trainee Theodore Houndini Anderson. (He's as sweet a dog as anyone's ever had!)  Let's see... My job... I find people elligible to undergo a procedure to cure cancer and other terminal illnesses. It's really pretty exciting. I've actually had a couple people say no to it before. I don't really have many hobbies. I mostly just hang out around my house when I'm not working, play with Garshie, help my friend's son with his homework, etc. Sometimes I'll meet some friends at O'Malleys for lunch or dinner, but that's about it.

        USER PROFILE    Well, howdy, campers. I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill, but Reeses already knew that. My job involves lots of things that...well, I'd have to kill you if I told you about them, and I'm sure Batman wouldn't take that too well...  As for hobbies: fishing. When I'm not doing that, it's annoying Danny, pestering Carter, or teaching Teal'c the idiosyncracies of the American language. Wonder if snake baiting counts...eh, the  other  kind of snake; nothing personal, Reeses.

      SARAH:  I wouldn't be so certain, Captain Sparrow. I'm sure that, given the right circumstances, you could die just as many times as Jack. And as he and the rest of my friends from that... company... would tell you, it really doesn't matter in what manner you die as long as there's... a certain piece of technology... nearby.  Sorry, it's just seemed that way, what with the baka and rum and "snake head" discussions and all.  Yeah, I'll try to convince her of that! Wait, you're from, what, the 1800's? And you know about different kinds of peanut butter?  Ah, yes, dark chocolate. The best food-like substance in the world! Too bad it's so expensive. Now, I won't take you up on any offer of rum, but if you're going to be handing out some of that "fine Caribbean dark chocolate", I'll be more than happy to lighten your load of that!  Nah, I'd rather that they were fully conscious and understand exactly how we're gonna cure them. (Though I have to admit, drunk or not, it's hilarious to see their faces when we tell them!)

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Well, unlike you, I can only live once and die once.  Im not afraid to die, love, but I would rather be killed doing something worth while than to be publicly exicuted.  Its to much publicity and i dont like crowds.  Plus if i have to hear my charges over and over again they could at least get my Rank right, savvy?  I have absolutely no negativity, and have not held a grudge since before i killed Barbossa, mate.    Peanut Butter is not even in the same catagory as Rum or Chocolate.  Peanut Butter is like eating sand, so corse and grainy unless you eat the crunchy kind.  Now, I have to say that sitting on the Pearl with a bottle of rum and some nice carribean chocolate is the best way to spend an afternoon at sea, savvy?  I prefer dark chocolate myself, it is a tad bitter, mate. I dont know... make them so drunk that they are oblivious to what they are going through?  Welcome Ava, at least someone around here thinks that Rum sounds good, in fact i shall go and endulge in some minor rum drinking, wouldnt want to be too drunk tommorrow Im sure.  Gooday, mates!

If you haven't had time to get caught up, others here include Kuronue (some anime), Colonel Jack O'Neill (Stargate), Captain Jack(three extra characters here) Sparrow (POTC), and me, Sarah Anderson (Stargate fanficdom).  A noose? A noose?! Hah! You're afraid of dying once! When I go on "buisiness trips", I have to worry about dying several times, which the good colonel here can attest to.  Okay, thanks for that understanding, captain. I suppose we could get to a point without so much negativity between us.  Lemme point somethin' out, Cpt. Sparrow: I was interpreting someone else's message to Jack. And, by the way, she says peanut butter's better than rum, beer, or chocolate. ...Humph. Now, how could any alcoholic beverage   help   with "the whole cancer thing"?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  ( Very calmly) I may not know what it is to be critised and judged because of my anatomy, love but try living your life in fear of a noose.  Nobody understands a pirates mind, most are not just mindless people who go stealing things and killing people.  Did You hear about when i sacked Nassasu Port without even firing a shot.  I did that to avoid casualties, mate.  Also, Im not like Barbossa, savvy.  He got what he want by killing.  Did you know that the cannons on my ship, when i was captain, were not used at all on ports but on the daily firieng against another pirate ship to see which where more powerful nines (usually wagered on a case of rum).  And, love, im sorry about the "baka" comment i realize it is that same as me saying "savvy".  (still calm but with a little more force) Never insult my rum, telling someone not to try rum is...is...blashphamy.  If CJ wants to try it, than he sure can, love.  Also, ever think that it could help with the whole cancer thing????

      SARAH:  Just get over it, huh, Sparrow? How do I "just get over it"? I find it extremely insulting. I bet you don't even know what it's like to be criticized and judged just based on your anatomy,   sir.   I like "baka." Besides, Mr. K understands it better; it's his own language.  *Visions of drunk demons dancing in her head...*    Humans are indeed confusing, but I would like to point out that they're not impossible to live with.    Jack, you up for keeping to your beer and not touching rum? Miss V says that beer is bad enough (for you), but rum sounds to be even worse.

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Kuronue, what kind of demon are you exactly? Also mate, exactly how much rum would you be needin.  The first  Sparrow Anger teatment  is to get the smell of rum so that you do not get sick.  I've had expiriance with Demons and rum before and, lets just say, it dosent sit well, savvy?  That Inuyasha couldnt stand the taste of it let alone the smell so "he settled for no less than total abstanence from the demon rum".  I say "demon rum" because of the effect it had on him.  If, demon-boy, you do not believe that i have met Inuyasha   you can go on Fanfiction.net and find the story called Pirates of the Carribean meets Inuyasha where  i am writing my adventures with this half-demon-dog-boy, savvy?  CJ, beer is  one  of the alcohalic agents in rum.  you also have the whiskey, burbon, and the vodca.  Your a military man no doubt, defenatly not a pirate because our rankings only go up to captain, but you should be able to handle some fine carribean rum.  And if you can't, mate, its pathetic, it truely is.

I'm keeping that rum in mind.  I think I'm going to need a lot of it.  *mumbles* Humans are so confusing.  This is why I never left Makai.

And why must you use the term Baka, idiot will suffice.  Also, demon boy - i would love to help you work out any anger issues you have.  Which, you must have because you got angry at someone typing your name wrong, savvy? Rum works wonders!!            Well for those of you who do not know me, I am The infamous Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you forget the CAPTAIN i might just send Elizabeth Swann after you and that IS something to be afraid of, mates.   adieu, avidosay, aloha, and all those other good-by things

       I'm sorry,  Captain , but that just seems like faulty reasoning to me. God knows what you're going to do, how you're going to go, what decisions you'll make, but that shouldn't give you an excuse for bad habits. Just because He knows what's going to happen doesn't mean that's the way he wants it to be, "savvy"? (Miss V wishes me to express her skepticism in my belief in a higher power. But that's the way she was brought up to think.)   &nbsp;   Ah, yes, Anime. You know, I kinda quit paying attention to that when I found a ton of other things to think about. You know, well-being of my world, how my friends are doing (and what trouble they've gotten into lately), grades and school, etc. But, yes, I suppose I can figure what you're talking about. (Though I'm much more of a Star Wars person. Jar Jar and John Williams all the way!)   &nbsp;   C. Sparrow, I think you need to give Mr. K a rather exact definition of the word "savvy". (Remember: proper capitilization can help to convey a clear and concise meaning!)

      Kuronue:  You know Inu-Yasha and Sesshomaru, I'm that kind of demon.  I agree with Sparrow.  Speaking of Sparrow, why do keep calling us all savvy?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  But love, if God choses when i go then he also knows the exact way i will go.  So maybe God has planed for me to die of liver failure from drinking to much rum, savvy?  So technicly, dying because of rum is not dying prematurly at all.  Though i would prefer a natural cause than a noose.

      High accumulation of spirit energy, huh? Never heard of it. Hey, that reminds me of something Jonas told me. Did you know that if all the energy in a banana was released at once when you ate it, you'd explode with body parts flying up to a mile apart?  Okay, so you're not a "demon" demon. Got it. Dunno anyone who'd freely admit it to me. 'Course I try to stay away from people like that. They bug me.  You know what, Captain Jack? I'd rather not die prematurely at all! I'll leave this... dimension when the good Lord's good'n'ready for me to!

      Kuronue:  As I have already pointed out, my eyes glow red, but I believe that is due to the fact that I have a high accumlination of spirit energy.  Also, I am a demon (not in the sense as you are reffering to).

      Schizophrenia? Not really. I mean, in the sense that it's two personalities in one body, I suppose so, but it's not any kind of mental disorder. Much more rewarding than that, really.  Yes, just yellow. So? Eyes can glow another color?    That to which she is referring is neither schizophrenia nor multiple personalities disorder. To reinforce her idea on this, she even researched the two; you can be sure that her analysis is correct.  As for glowing eyes, I am aware of only one chemical which can cause this, and it has a tendancy to cause the eyes to flash in a yellow or golden light. I hold no expectation that there is no other chemical with such a property.

      Kuronue:  I seriously doubt that I'm a snake-head.  From what I understand from watching it, it seems that what you are speaking of is like schizophrenia.  Also, their eyes only appear to glow yellow.

       Then maybe&nbsp;you're a snake-head as well?   &nbsp;   I'm thinking "run" is always a good option, though Miss V says that if you're really the aforementioned source of evil, by all means, "fight you guys" is the best option.   &nbsp;   I can see the immense frustration. When my eyes glow, it's not usually in the dark, mostly because I like light. Halogen lamps are the best next to pure sunlight, though I'll settle for a set of incandescent bulbs. (I think; it's been a long time since eighth grade science!) Or the light provided by computer moniters. That's always good. Ah... the wonders of e-mail! Fanfiction! Star Wars fan sites! All wondrous things to be looking at late into the night! Of course, that's not usually when my eyes glow. In fact, I think my eyes glow the least then and--   &nbsp;     I'm sorry.

I was describing Kurama's gray hair, not your *eh-hem*   silver   ... locks. I was just saying that there should be an "'c" on the end of "teal". That's all.   Really, captain... Miss V has her full support behind Jack's question. She also wants to warn you about something to do with the liver. (I really was trying not to listen.)  Ooh! Yay! Shoot the glowy-eyed demon! Wait a minute! Shoot the   EVIL   glowy-eyed demon!

I have Daniel to blame- er, thank for that. And its silver, and distinguished i'll have you know.  Hey, Captain Jack, explain to me just how Rum helps with communication. 'Cause here i am thinking that alcohol, being a muscle relaxant and reducing co-ordination and all that crap wouldn't help. Specially somehting as strong as neat rum...i've allways found that it makes it  harder  to talk. And be understood at least.  Any place with a glowing-eyed 'demon' leader is no place i wanna be. Unless i get to shoot it.

It was as painful as my last tetnis shot from ol' Doc Frasier!)   &nbsp;   "Demon World." Never heard of it. Does it have an address? Makai, hm?

Though I think that whole "in person" bit might be a problem. How 'bout I call you tomorrow afternoon around four?  Uh, captain, rum really wasn't involved in this conversation. It solved no problems and therefore doesn't get any credit. Tough luck.

(By the way, if you can't pronounce my name just stick with K)  You really need to understand the world that I come from to understand the referecnes that I make.  We should meet in person so then we could sit down with a nice cup of tea and discuss my past.

       SARAH:   &nbsp;   On the contrary, it kind of is brain surgery; you have to&nbsp;basically rewire or&nbsp;reprogram&nbsp;my brain to think of you as anyone other than Mr. K or just K.   &nbsp;   Oh, yeah,  all  humans would be gone. Like that could happen! Gimme a break! No one knows where  all  the galaxy's humans are. And because of that cell organization of the human race, you'll never,  never  be able to say that  anyone  could or would kill  all  humans.   &nbsp;   T-Guru? Is that the official Guru of Togo? Leader of what? You're going to have to be more specific when you say stuff like that. I don't blame him. I might kill a demon just for looking at me if he caught me in the wrong mood.    &nbsp;   "Despised demon gods"? I think I know who you're talking about. (Doesn't that sound like them to you, Jack?) Though I've never heard of any of them disguising themselves. 'Cept for Nirrti, of course, if you want to call an invisibility cloak a disguise.    &nbsp;   Koo-ra-ma? Hmm. I've got a picture of him sitting around somewhere, I think. Doesn't he wear teal ('c, right Jack?) and have gray-ish hair? Not the connotation of gray hair connected with old people, but... a...  vivacious  gray.    &nbsp;   Join forces? Excuse me, but for one, what against? I have&nbsp;some enemies&nbsp;in mind, but I probably can't tell you about them. For two, how do you know that I'd be any force to be reckoned with? After all, I basically sit around my house all day and look after my friend's son. And Garshie. Garshie's such a cute little husky!

      Kuronue:  Ker-ron-oo-ay that's how you pronounce my name.  It's not brain surgery.  I shouldn't have said most humans would be wiped out, ALL humans would be gone.  I'm sure there are a few demons that would gladly devour your souls and your bodies.  Only problem with that is that Toguro might be the leader which would be bad for everyone.  That guy would kill a demon for just looking at him.  Maybe we should just join forces after all.  I could use some allies, I just found out that one of the despised demon gods disguised himself as me and tried to kill Kurama.  (Fool)

      SARAH:  I don't know how to spell it, K, because I have to be able to say it to remember it. If I can't remember it, I can't spell it. Besides, it's more fun, messing with your mind and all.  Excuse me, but if they enslave humans, I don't think they'd "be more pathetic". Mind you, I'm not saying they're not pathetic; apparently, power and pitifulness have no correlation. I just want you to realize that you're stereotyping.   The Spirit World? Gimme a break! The "spirit world" can kiss my... Miss V's .... my ... boots!... for all I care. For one, I have a higher power working on my side that has got to make the "spirit world"'s apparent "power" look like a rubberband next to an ion cannon or a ballistic missile. For two, if most of us would be wiped out, I'd either be dead (in which case I wouldn't give a cow pattie) or ... elsewhere, where I'd work on finding a way to kick the butt of whoever did it, but I wouldn't be dead.

Of course, if the Spirit World wasn't on your side, most of you would be wiped out.  DEMONS ARE BETTER!  (My kind are at any rate)

To be truthful, she isn't all that aesthetically pleasing to me, either.  It's because those demons are too caught up in trading insults to understand the concept of sarcasm.  K, Kuronuway, whatever: You say anything like "the humans should be exterminated" one more time and... and... I'll... use my "blue Force energy" on you, causing you great pain and possibly a bit of a black-out. As Jack said, if we're so pathetic, why don't evil guys with glowing eyes rule the world?

So the next time I happen into a biology class, you can cut the fish's head off, right?  Actually, Mr. K, Miss V has been called a demon before. I'm sorry, but peanut butter has nothing on chocolate. (Miss V says it's the other way around.) Really, Mr. K, there's no reason to be   that   upset. We're all friends here, right? (Ish?)  I'm not particularly fond of either, Ava, but Miss V was commenting that peanut butter is better for you physically than rum.  Excuse me, Muiya, but I believe you and Miss V are mistaken. DARK CHOCOLATE rules over all, well, maybe just CHOCOLATE in general; there's no age limit. You can get addicted from the time you can eat.  Thank you, Jack!!! Wait, you completely lost me with the reference to techno-babble. What's that?  I don't know how the peanut butter and alcohol thing started, but I bet it has something to do with Sparrow and me.  Ooh! Behold the power of demon mothers! Hah! My demon's mother is... Okay, nevermind. She says not to go there.

Definately sticking to the beer...with the occasional Whiskey maybe.  She's right. If you ever meet anyone with an unhealthy obsession with tacky decor and delusions of power then run away. Far away.  Peanut butter and Marmite...greatest snack in this Galaxy and several others.  Ah, but Captain Jack, does it say Captain on your uniform?  Wait, don't you have some way of preventing that? Something about the brain being intact and then they cant bring you back? I'd swear Jacob said somehting about it but...i wasn't really listening. What? Carter and Danny were techno-babbling!

      Kuronue:  Death Print Bull's-Eyes aren't really telekinesis.  You see, the techinigue is proformed by actually marking the victims body with spirit energy and the ammunition (which can be anything from rocks to a fuel truck) follows that small ammount of spirit energy and normally hits the marks.  Unless you're like Urameshi, than you can always dodge them.

       Ooh! Telekinesis! That's what I like about zats. It's hard to stop pure energy, even if you have something like telekinesis working for you. (And it's not usually affected by gravity unless you have something on the scale of a black hole nearby.)   &nbsp;   That's about the only solution I've been working with for the past few years anyway. I guess I'll just have to stick to it. I was just hoping there's something else I could do. I've talked around the base a bit, and the best people can tell me is to go meditate. If meditation helped cure you, I can see why my health's on the abnormal side (for me, which usually just entails a sore muscle or something) with all the racket Matt added to my peaceful little home.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill,&nbsp; Stargate SG-1&nbsp;           		  Do you Yahoo!?

       That's a good point. Why do you think Daniel thought he could get away with it. And where were you at the time? I mean, SG-1: it's rare that y'all don't do something together.   &nbsp;   K, I wasn't asking about the dream; if I was, I'd've described it. I was asking if you had any suggestions to dull the pain, something other than time and ibuprofin, which are only so effective. (And don't tell me antacids, either; I've tried. They work less than the ibuprofin.)   &nbsp;   I bet knives will go through you when thrown from a distance when they have gravity working on their side.                   -the Sorceress of Stories and Scifi         "Dogs are my favorite people." -Colonel Jack O'Neill,&nbsp; Stargate SG-1&nbsp;           		  Do you Yahoo!?

      Kuronue:  Dreams are not my department.  Find someone else for that.  And who said anything about ancient China?  The portal through which I came was in Japan, not even ancient Japan.  Believe me, spears are a lot worse, knives will rarely go through you from a very good distance.  Unless you are marked by Sniper's Death Print Bull's-Eyes.

        Col. Jack O'Neill:      &nbsp;   Oooh, that's neat...its all blue...   &nbsp;   For the record, and anyone who hadn't noticed, i tend to speak...type...first and think never.   &nbsp;   I wouldn't call it reincarnated. That implies&nbsp;some kind of new body, or coming back as a butterfly or a dog or something...this is same body, just without the extra holes.   Swiss cheese...(do they have swiss cheese in ancient china?) Don't think i've ever had lots of holes all at once but i've had a couple. That was knifes, and acid though.   &nbsp;   Well, either way you're still a better being than i am for doing it. (I'm being nice; make the most of it)   &nbsp;   I'm sure Selmak can give you a much better blow-b-blow description of exactly where we were, why we were doing it, and why Daniel thought he could get away with it.   &nbsp;   Alright, alright, i get the point.

       K: So you still think that being zatted isn't as bad? Hm. Maybe you've got tips I can put into practice. You see, every now and then, I have this nightmare, and I wake up with my throat burning, especially when the dream's really vivid.   &nbsp;   Captain: What's a "plage"? Never heard of it. Oh, I get it, you meant "plague". That's kind of one of the benefits of good spelling: good communication.   Not worth your time? Isn't that a little harsh? To take Miss V's words, isn't she still a fellow human from  your  planet and time? I mean, you have more in common with her than you do with most of us on this blogging "IM".    		  Do you Yahoo!?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  its nice to know that i am the only one in this bunch that can only die once. (sarcasum *drip drip*) Once again i was only comparing being hung with liver failure, savvy?  But if you wish to ask my opinion, i agree with CJ that crucifiction would be horrable and humiliating.  Did you know that the word excrutiating came from crucifiction because of the pain and agony you go through, mate?  I also agree with CJ that being torchered would not be wonderful either.  Many pirates go through that if you take hostages but i am not that ruthless.  Also the british officials, namely norington, are not smart enough to torcher pirates.  Although, mate, if elizabeth swann was a pirate hater i would never go near port royale ever again, savvy?

       Ehem. Very funny, Jack...  &nbsp; I  do it every year, not Vinnet. She just sits there and yells at me while I'm doing it, something about "bad for you" and putting down Christianity. I'll show her one day. She's so wrong about that.   &nbsp;   He did?! That's hilarious! I wish I was there to see it!   &nbsp;   K, it has nothing to do with reincarnation. It's more of a Lazarus thing, being brought back to life. Reincarnation entails also changing forms, somehow.   Well, apparently, it's fun for some, the whole making others into swiss cheese thing. Again, I shouldn't really comment, but I'm sure Jack can sympathize with you.   		  Do you Yahoo!? Friends.  Fun.  urlLink Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger

(They want me to repent for my thievery.  That pompous little wind bag, Koenma, really knows how to irk someone.  He should go after the people who through those spears.  The one through my leg would have been enough, but no, they had to turn me into swiss cheese.)

You do that every year? You're a better man than me. Wait...a better snake...or something...  I didn't do a thing. It was Daniel. Do you think that i'd be able to reply to an Evil Snake in their own language to tell them that i'm the "Great God Oz"?  C'mon, you know me and snakes...its nothing personal.

What did you do, Jack?   &nbsp;   I don't know. Can a Jaffa Geek become First Prime? That would me like me winning a popularity contest back in high school.    &nbsp;   Exactly.&nbsp;I can barely stand the  little  needles as it is.

      Col. Jack O'Neill:  Pretty good actually, thanks for asking.  Trust me, Zat's are not a 'heck of a thrill'. Try having every nerve on your body set on fire. And humiliating? A noose is nothing...ever been tortured to death? And then brought back to do it again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again? And again...i lost count in the end. Knowing that you can't resist the urge to scream like a girl for much longer is humiliating...not a quick drop, probable snap of the neck before a relatively quick asphyxiation. Oh, and here's one for Reeses...well, half of her...crucifixtion. I'm irked.  That all? Where do you get the energy?  No, not the great god  of  Oz...just "The Great God Oz." Ask Daniel some time...or Jacob 'n' Selmak.  Yeah, well, it remains to be seen whether or not they like it as much as T. FOr all we know he could be a Jaffa Geek.  Yup, and if you get the Doc P.O'd then she brings out the  really  big needles.  Yeah...I'm not so sure that applies when the 'alien resides within you' as opposed to 'with you in your land'. If it did, all those creepy bugs you can get in the tropics, or Africa wouldn't make you so damned ill. And there's this one little fish that, when you're peeing...well, i think you get the point.

       Yes, rhymes. That happens some tymes. Thanks, K. See, Capt. Jack: you've got access to a computer, you've got access to at least a dozen spell-checkers. As to the spelling of "grammer," I think that's another nationality difference, same as "honour" and "color".   Actually, Jack, I've had very little chocolate today. One little serving of chocolate ice cream and that's it. Very abnormal for me. But at that point, I think I was still on my regular dose.      I must point out that there are worse ways to "go" than being hanged or being shot. Colonel O'Neill has found quite a few of them.  If anyone cares, the worst death I can think of is dehydration. Either that or acid. But I've done neither. (I would say obviously, but sometimes, that's not so obvious.)   Alright, Jack, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. "The Great god of Oz"? Gimme a break!   Yes. All Jaffa should watch each Star Wars episode at least four times. I'll keep them company if they don't try to bite my head off first. Maybe I'll just happen not to mention that I'm a ... while around them.   Excuse me... "Counciling and medication"? I'm perfectly healthy, thank you! If I wasn't, Miss V would kindly let me know. *Miff* "Counciling and medication". Even if Miss V didn't constantly moniter my state of mind, body, and general health, I get a stinkin' physical every time I come back from a mission!    Lip piercing? May I "put in my two cents' worth"? Having a piece of metal jammed into your lip has several side effects. For one, it chips your teeth. You may possibly have to receive ceramic replacements. For two, though the social interactions among peers may improve, any respectable employer who might try to attract elderly customers would not hire someone with such a piercing.  Plus, (although I think Miss V summed it up pretty well), Leviticus 19:28: "You shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tatoo any marks upon you: I am the LORD." (It wasn't really the one I was looking for, but it's close.)   Hey, Jack (both of y'all): While I was looking for that, I came across another one I thought would be interesting for y'all to hear. Miss V likes it. Leviticus 19:33-34: "When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. (34) The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were alines in the land of Egypt..." 'Course, that's just what it says in the NRS version.

      Kuronue:  I personally think it is better to be disintergrated by in a blast of demon energy than either of the deaths you speak of.  Then again, you will most likely end up in the same place either way.  The worst death I can think of is dying of a loss of blood.  (Stupid spears.)

You sound like Carter when she see's some new peice of tech.  Explain to me exactly how dying relatively quickly by noose is better than dying the long, slow, painful way of liver failure? From my experience...a bullet in the chest is the best way to go.  Gotta say the only God i believe in is "the Great God Oz."  Has Teal'c been sneaking Star Wars DVD's into the alpha site shipments again? He seems to think that all of his Jaffa buddies should see it at least four times.

       Sorry, Captain, but you seemed like such an intelligent person until we looked at your grammer and spelling. The best thing about learning a foreign language is learning how to spell "conjugation." It's a good thing to know when you speak German. (Conjugations of "sein" and all: bin, bist, ist, sind, seit, etc.) (On a similar note, I believe that they are "Eunichs,  too .")   &nbsp;   Not ready to give it up that easy, huh? Giving up anything isn't easy. Kinda reminds me of all the people I've seen that have given up their homes, jobs, and all that just in the hopes that they might get to see them again. Sounds kinda odd, doesn't it?<>

Inventers of mayonaise who are also wonderfull singers and are obssessed about raisins.  Eunichs to.  As to you, Sarah, I was just stating the obvious and though it may be a bad habit i am hooked.  Being a pirate is almost as bad as execively drinking, yet, that is the way God inteded for me to live as a pirate.  So though i know the entire "your body is a temple", love, i am not ready to give up rum that easy.  And thank you Kuronue for agreeing with me.  Ah, Inuyasha... dont go there, mate! Not that i didnt like the guy, in fact you could say tha we are "friends" but you need to be away from him for a while, a long while.

Baka:  *picks up empty rum bottle*  Did you drink all the rest of this?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  So, Kuronue ran off into the distance completely drunk?  Buddha:  Yeah, I guess he did.

      Kuronue:  *catches rum*  Cheers.  *takes drink*  Baka has been on my case since I was a thief in Makai.  Strange thing, she never bothered Kurama.  What'ya suppose that means Buddha?  *hands Buddha the bottle*  Buddha:  *takes bottle*  I wouldn't know.  Sanzo's views are correct.  *takes particularly long swig*  Kuronue:  Oi!  Save some for me!  Buddha:  Sorry.  Kuronue:  S'okay.  Buddha:  But who knew that the highest priest of Buddhism was blasphemous?  And who knew a god would say that?  Kuronue:  Don't feel bad.  Buddhism is on a comeback.  Me, personally, enjoy being an atheist.  Baka:  *enters right*  Buddha, what are you doing?  Buddha and Kuronue:  Aw shaddup!  Baka:  I'm so glad I'm a Christian.  Kuronue:  Now, you're a Christian, yet you're sitting here talking to a god of a completely different religion.  Buddha:  Depends on your beliefs.  You see, she knows that I was more of an extreme follower of Allah.  I'm not really a god, but I ascended to a god-like level.  Baka:  This should be a sitcom.  Kuronue:  Hey, other people, come join the party.  Baka:  I'm out.  Kuronue:  Good riddance.  Baka:  Why I outta...  Kuronue:  Outta what?  Buddha:  Will the two of you be quiet?  Don't start fighting now.  Baka, go grab a drink for yourself and have a seat.  Kuronue:  Bring some food, too.  Baka:  Like I would bring you food.  Buddha:  Someone else can bring the food.  Baka:  *shrugs**goes and gets a carbonated drink**returns**sits down beside Kuronue*  When did we get bean bag chairs?  Kuronue:  Good question.  Lindsay:  Hello, this is just a cameo appearance from yours truly.  I would like to point out that I, like Baka, am a Christian and, while writing this whole thing, was thinking what it would be like if a Christian demon, Buddha, and an atheistic demon got together on a little chat.  This does not reflect my views on anything, and if that's what you got from this I am sorry.  So even if this has no particular plot to it, I have my own plot.  Fronkeys rock!

        Col. Jack O'Neill:      &nbsp;    How can you not like cake? Not even chocolate cake?    &nbsp;   There are books? I'll tell him that; keep him occupied when he's in the infirmary with Danny.

Is it just me still in 2004?   &nbsp;   Kuronue and Baka - you two should go on the road..you're a pretty sweet double-act!   &nbsp;   As for the rest of you (except Reeses)&nbsp;I think you're crazy!   &nbsp;   But then, who said that's a bad thing!?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Cant you do anything other than fight, mates!  It is getting rather annoying.  I think you need your rum now Kuronue. *tosses rum to Kuronue*.  It might help with the anger inside, savvy?

      Baka:  I'm a bit confused by all of this talk of burning rum and trying to save Will.  Buddha:  I have no insight into this either.  Baka:  Where's Kuro?  Buddha:  He's a bit indisposed at the moment.  Baka:  He still knocked out?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Do you think you might've hit him a bit too hard?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  The rest of you must really hate Kuronue if you don't even comment about that sudden attack.  Buddha:  He had it coming.  Baka:  Yeah, but Gojyo is just like Kuronue and you don't do anything to him.  Buddha:  He's aiding in saving Shangri'la.  Kuronue, however, had no distinct purpose.  Kuronue:  Hey, I can hear you two!  Baka:  You're up.  Kuronue:  Yeah, yeah.  It's times like these I wish I was back in Makai.  Baka:  *sarcastically*  Oh, does poor Bat Boy want a cookie?  Kuronue:  You little bitch!  *chases Baka again*  Baka:  You'll never catch me!  Kuronue:  We'll see about that, you bastard!  Baka:  Swearing will get you nowhere.  Kuronue:  *pulls out scythe and throws*  Baka:  *too distracted by the scythe coming towards her, trips over her own feet*  Kuronue:  *stops running*  I didn't even hit her and she falls down; this is too pathetic for words.

      Jenn:  I am watching the food chanel and they are making a drink using rum, sugar, diet coke, and red wine.  Then they are taking some and thickening it with baking soda and water to use to marinate steaks.  it turns out that because rum has so much alcohal in it, the different types cancel out each other and make it tast more alcohalic withought having that much alcohal.  That is why you must drink a lot to get drunk.  Elizabeth:  So that is why jack didnt get drunk after 5 bottles of rum when we were on that island.  Jenn: exactly!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Please dont remind me about the Island, mates.  Jenn: the whole burning rum thing!   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: yea.  Elizabeth: im sorry Jack but i wanted to get out and save Will  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: I understand, love  Elizabeth: Really?  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I was able to vent on the island, im not mad it is just a scar.

      Buddha:  You don't scare me.  Baka:  Me either, but I'm a demon and Buddha's a god.  I'm only scared of youkai.  Kuronue:  Youkai are the same thing as demons.  Baka:  That may be true, but you read Saiyuki.  You saw how they acted.  Kuronue:  Please, I've done worse.  Baka and Buddha:  *large collective gasp*  Kuronue:  What?  By the way, that wasn't exactly Japanese money.  It was demon money.  Baka:  *sing-song voice*  As I've said before, Makai money no good in Tortoise.  Kuronue:  You're starting to sound like Haruhara Haruko.  Baka:  I should invite her and Atomisk over.  Kuronue and Buddha:  No!  Baka:  Would you prefer Goku?  Kuronue:  I don't want a monkey here.  Baka:  He's not such a monkey.  Kuronue:  If you're going to invite some character from Saiyuki here, make it one of those women.  Baka:  Ew!  Kuronue:  Oh, I forgot, there's a kid here.  Buddha:  You're a vile person.  Kuronue:  What's your point?  Baka and Buddha:  *stares angrily at Kuronue*  Baka:  Remember when you said you should strike Kuronue down?  Buddha:  Yes.  Baka:  Now is the time to use that divine power.  Buddha:  That would make me a hypocrite.  Kuronue:  *sarcastically*  God forbid you become a hypocrite!  Buddha:  But if I must commit an act of blasphemy to get rid of you so be it.  *ball of energy forms in hands*  Kuronue:  Now, there's no need for that.  Buddha:  *throws chi in Kuronue's direction*  Kuronue:  *dodges quickly*  Jeez, for a god you have terrible aim.  *another ball of energy hits Kuronue in the stomach*  Ai!  Baka:  That was fun.

      Jenn:  NO, i do not have a problem with legolas  Elizabeth:  Who?  Jenn:  The nice twin of Will.  Elizabeth: OH! And, Jack is just... well, Jack.  He is very smart though.  I agree he is wierd, for a pirate he is so mild mannered.  Do take in mind that i said "for a pirate".  Will is mine!  he is a blacksmith and he is sooo could looking!!  Jenn: *Cough*  Elizabeth: *glares*  I love him.  We met when we were 10.  *sigh*  And Orlando Bloom is some guy who i just slapped and is doubling over right now.  Should have slaped him with my hand in the face not my foot.  Jenn: ^_^  foot is good!  Um.. Orlando bloom is not that bad.  He said basicly on a audio interview i listened to that women were not as strong as men and that they were put on the earth for one reason.  I didnt like that, but i listened to some more that said that his idol was Johnny Depp who told him that women are strong if not stronger then men.  Then that he went on to tell bloom that he watched his wife give birth to their daughter and he almost fainted from her cutting off the circulation to his hand.   Elizabeth:  If woman arent that strong then why is he doubling over and i am not!!! HA - Evil twin of my dear sweet william!  Jenn:  yes, but Legolas and Will arent womanizers.  But true, "with any character you play there has to be a little of you inside or else it is not acting, its lying." -- Johnny Depp.  Good going Sarah!  Oh look Jack is back!! ^_^  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  ello, mates!  No time no speak.  it seems that the casher does not take Japanese money.  Oh and i know Japanese when i see it, i spent a long time with Inuyasha.  Uhem,, i wonder how i got that type of money Kuronue?!  And Sarah, love, im over it.  Why am i on your bad side?    Jenn: *singing* Why cant we be friends, why cant we be friends.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shutup!  Jenn: Whatever you say.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  She is stairing at me wierd, mates!  Elizabeth:  Gin is ok, it is not Rum so Jack will not be interested.  Im more of a white wine spritzer.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Ah Gin.. gin is good!  It is more mild than rum, more of a desert wine for me, love.  I have recently ecperimented in prison and adding gin to rum.  it was good, i call it Sparrow Rum!  Jenn: sorry.  it has already been invented and givin a name by me!  Gin Rummy!!! Hahahahahaha.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I think im gonna leave, mates.  This woman is scaring me!  Jenn:  Ha, I scare all!!! *follows Jack*  Elizabeth:  Well, im going to go save Jack! Good day.

      Baka:  I only took two courses in Spanish.  I'm going into Latin!  I do know a few words in Goa'uld, but not enough to make conversation.  In fact, I only know two to six words.  Kuronue:  I don't know any other language except Japanese and English.  For your sakes, I speak in English.  Buddha:  I know many languages.  Baka:  Hey, Sanbutsushin-san, shouldn't you be helping Genjyo Sanzo and company.  Buddha:  Good point.  *disappears*  Baka:  Good luck against Gyumaoh, and tell Sanzo he owes me one-hundred dollars for that game of oisho-kabu.  Kuronue:  Isn't this Sanzo guy a Buddhist monk?  *picks up Baka's Saiyuki graphic novel*  Strange monk.  Baka:  Hey, that's my graphic novel!  Kuronue:  *holds above head*  Come and get little one.  Baka:  Hey, only my cousins are allowed to call me little one!  *jumps up and misses*  Give it back, you jerk.  Kuronue:  Oh, I'm hurt.  This is Kuronue, signing out for Baka and Buddha.  Baka:  *jumps*  Kuronue:  *hits Baka in head*

      SARAH:  That's okay; I usually can't hold grudges very long. He's still not on my good side. In my mind, there's very little distinction between Bloom and Bloom characters. Deep down in side, they're all the same person. No one can play a character he can't agree with; you have to get in character.   Baka, good for you being a Christian! I wear Christian shirts... to other bases... all the time! It's kinda funny 'cause I'm the only one there with a t-shirt on at all, but I figure that if I might have to watch my friends die, I might as well be comfortable.   Ah, that explains that, considering I think it's roughly around 2013... I've never heard of those planets. Are they Protected Planets? Do they each have a Chaapa'ai?  Great. So someone speaks Japanese. Someone speaks Spanish. Where are the people that speak "the language of the gods", for lack of permission to use the better name? How 'bout Deutsch? Mal kat!!! Foulspeil!!!

      Church:  Year(s)? Well keep in mind I haven't been on Earth for... However long... Switching between Sidewinder and Blood Gulch... I really don't know what year it is. Seriously, if traveling to other countries on Earth causes massive jet lag, think about what traveling to other planets will do to ya'. I've lost years to jet lag... Probably. Well, I'll try to calculate it... Master Chief destroyed the Covenant Armada in 2552. It's probably somewhere around 2553-2555. But once again, massive jet lag.  Hey, Elizabeth, what's with that Jack guy? That's one weird drunk. And who's this Will person? Who's Orlando Bloom?  Hey Baka, you speak Spanish? Hablo Español. No  sé  Español, pero lo hablo.

      Baka:  You even have a problem with Legolas?  But he's an awesome elf.  Buddha:  He was quite good in Lord of the Rings.  Kuronue:  I'm going to regret this, but how the hell did you see Lord of the Rings?  Buddha:  I can take many forms.  Kuronue:  What did you turn into a cat and go to the theater?  Buddha:  How dare you!  Baka:  Kuronue, do have any idea what the cat symbolizes in Buddhism?  Kuronue:  Yes.  Baka:  The cat represents evil.  Sidhartha Guitamo was one of the most pure gods.  Besides God, no one is better than God.  Kuronue:  It appears you practice two religions.  Baka:  No, I'm Christian.  I just know a lot about Buddhism, like Buddha's real name.  Kuronue:  How did Buddha get into this anyway?  Buddha:  I'm just a part of Buddha, but I'm not sure how I got into this.

      Baka:  *giggles even more feverently*  Makai money doesn't work well in Tortoise, eh?  Kuronue:  Why do you keep saying tortoise?  Baka:  Because Tortuga is Tortoise in Spanish.  Kuronue:  What is Spanish?  Baka:  You don't really know jack about normal people, do you?  Kuronue:  Just tell me.  Baka:  It's a human language.  I'm a bit off track aren't I?  Kuronue:  *sarcastically* No Baka, you're right on.  Baka:  Shut it.  I think that peanut butter and chocolate are both good, especially when bonded together to form an awesome, unhealthy, fattening snacky.  Kuronue:  Is there s'pose to be some kind of hidden meaning in there?  Baka:  Do you even know what we are talking about?  Kuronue:  Only slightly.  Baka:  All the more reason to stay out of this.  Random voice from the abyss:  And so the argument went on.  It finally ended when Baka made a rude comment about Kuronue's past life and was thrown off a building only to be caught by the waiting arms of her boyfriend,...  Baka:  Hey, don't tell the public.  That's only between you and I.  Voice:  Sorry.  It's not easy being part of the Sanbutsushin.  Baka:  I'm not familiar with that particular term.  Voice:  I am one of the three parts of the Buddha.  Baka and Kuronue together:  You're a god?!!!  Voice:  I think there is a question you have yet to answer.  *abyss closes and Buddha disappears*  Baka:  Oh yeah, YYH is the acronym for Yu-Yu Hakusho (that means ghost files or poltergeist report).  Kuronue:  Are you done yammering?  Baka:  Don't be so rude.  Kuronue:  You should really be talking.  Baka:  Hey!  You wanna piece of me!  Fine, lets see you throw me off a building again!  Kuronue:  You want to land in...  Baka:  Don't say it!  Buddha:  *peeking out from a cloud of smoke**slaps forehead*  Not again.  I ought to strike them both down, but I can't take other creatures' lives.  This is worse than the behavior of Sanzo.

      SARAH:  Wow, Church, that's horrible! I'm sure   someone   cared about you, right? Actually, no, that didn't answer my question. I've never heard of it. In what year(s) does it take place?  ...Another no comment to Baka and K. So... Baka... *evil smile* If I called you Dummkopf, you wouldn't be insulted, right? Same if I called you Nerfherder?  Actually, you get at least 90% of the information from the books. If he hasn't read them, he must not know ninety percent of it. Yup. All the more fun.  Well... I'm not much of a cake fan... How 'bout chocolate?    Bringing such a substance to a party would be incredibly insulting for some of us. I would rather not ingest any of it.    What? Like peanut butter is any better?    It is.    It's not candy! There's no sugar! It's too nutritious; it's a high source of protein! Wouldn't you rather get your serving of protein on something more expensive like ribs?    What is the point of spending a superfluous amount of money for actual meat? At our bases, we do not even have meat.    Yeah, well, enjoy it while you can! There's no point in training yourself to eat bad food when we live here most of the time.    Peanut butter is not bad food.    Neither is chocolate.    Chocolate has no nutritional value.    Peanut butter has no taste value.    It is not all about taste.    You're in America; of course it is!  Anyway... Sorry about that. But if y'all could convince her that she's wrong, I'd greatly appreciate it.  He does? Wow. I don't have many of his CDs anyway, so I don't think the video would do any good. But if I could get my hands on his song about dead puppies, that could be entertaining.  Well, Elizabeth, I'd help you get them out, but I have a particular grudge against Sparrow at the moment and my friend has a particular grudge against Turner-boy there. You're kinda on you on with that one unless anyone's feeling a bit friendlier than I am.

      Elizabeth:  Jack is in jail right now so he cant talk.  Both of us and Will were on the pearl yesterday traveling to tortuga and he tried to buy Rum.  A wierd looking form of money was in the wad of cash and they acused him of cheating them.  I tried to reason with them but they just took Will with them and kicked me out.  So to refraise, both Jack and Will are in a jail in tortuga.  At least Gibbs was there to take me home.

And then we could nail them and bring the bastards down for illegal gun running.   &nbsp;   Anytime there's a party there's cake too. We can use your money for the cake if you're really that bothered....   &nbsp;   Ooooh, Don Maclean and Weird Al...two of teh greatest singers around. Unless Don died...I think he was old enough...but still great.   Y'Know weird Al's got a video for that?!   &nbsp;   Hey, Church. Gotta say i can't blame you for getting antsy about the death thing; it gives me the wiggins too, and i've been there  way  too many times. Still, you weren't here at the time so...   &nbsp;   Beer doesn't exactly rot your gut at quite the same rate. Not uless you drink a whole keg to yourself. Daily. And i don't drink it all the time...just most of the time. Ooooh, see, Reeses agrees with me! 'Cept she said it first so technically - we both agree on the point. Listen to your elders.   &nbsp;   Uhhh....*yells* DANIEL!!! Dammit he's not here. I can do spanish or portuguese and maybe a little arabic. Certain phrases in "Ancient Egyptian". "Ancient Latin". Not...whatever taht was. Ah.   &nbsp;   Cool. I know a guy who was kinda like that once. Threw my shoe through him once, while he was tryig to convince me taht i wasn't hallucinating,in between deaths.   &nbsp;   Ah...Halo....'kay, so i've never heard of it. I can relate on the war part though. Only the really big, official ones get names...the others are jsut "The war with [insert name of opposing force]".   &nbsp;   YYH?....?   &nbsp;   Give me Mary Steinburgen any day.

      Baka:  Did someone call me?  Kuronue:  No, you...on second thought...imbecile.  Baka:  Ha!  Can't call me idiot can you?  Nope, because my name means idiot.  *laughs triumphantly*  Kuronue:  That's really not something to be proud of.  Baka:  Forget you.  Why don't you just slip out of existence?  Kuronue:  *stares blankly*  Baka:  It seems you already have.  By the way, speaking of Japanese, I am writing a story of how I really met the YYH gang.  It's called "Baka no Hakusho" which means Idiot's Report, but since my name is Baka it is "Baka's Report."  You can also read "The Misadventures of Baka, Cinni, and the YYH Gang."  I'm writing that with Muiya, but I'll probably have to change the title.  The address is bakanohakusho.blogspot.com.  I love it.  Misadventures is bandcinyyh.blogspot.com.  Oh man, Mom's watching The View.  Help!  Kuronue:  What's the matter, Baka?  Don't like that show?  Baka:  It's on the same level as Oprah and Martha Stewart.  Bleah!  Evil!  They are the utter faces of evil.  Kuronue:  Hey, Sparrow, got any room at your place?

      Church:  Well, you see,  I've  never been brought back (there was not even an effort to bring me back), but the Red's sarge was. He had a bullet wound to the head, and apparently they just gave him mouth-to-mouth. I was merely comforted (aka told to die by Tucker).  Actually, the war is still going on (that's why I'm still at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, like I'd spend my free time there), but aside from that... What war? That's a good question. Well, you see, after Master Chief destroyed the entire Covenant Armada on Halo, some sort of war broke out, I don't even know why. The two factions (basically that means sides, for those of you who don't know) were Red and Blue. I guess, for now, it's just called The War of Red vs Blue. I hope that answered your question.

      SARAH:  By the standards of Earth, 2004, as as far as most Tau'ri know, I've got to be more normal than most of you. Except maybe the military people.  I see, Church. I've never actually been dead. (Ah, the sheltered life of a Tau'ri! Or Erdling, if you like the term better. Same diff.) But I have memories of coming awfully close.   So you've been brought back, huh? How? I mean... I don't want to say too much, but I thought we didn't have the technology any more than we have the technology to... throw people across the room without touching them and without harming them except for impact with the ground.  What war did you fight in, Church? I don't recognize the sides.

      Church:  Well, so there are other dead people too, huh? Also died multiple times? I've died twice, both times killed by the same person... A member of my own army. Sucks, huh? My initial death was from a tank. The other was when I possessed the Red Armies sergeant, and got shot in the head. Unfortunately, they were able to bring him back to life. Oh, have you ever tried to trick a newly dead man into giving you ten dollars to "get into heaven"? Just wondering. Also, just to straighten things out, I'm a ghost, so being dead to me is just like being alive, only I can be seen through.

      Ehem. *glares pointedly at Sparrow* Rum is a bit stronger than beer, wouldn't you say? Besides, that beer could be going to a good cause: a special occasion. If you drink all the time, it's not a special occasion, and it takes away that pleasure of that knowledge. Doesn't rum have a higher concentration of alcohol than beer?  Again, it's the British people that don't know proper grammer. (Sorry, Jedi master, but your grammer   is   better than hers!)  Oh, we could have plenty of fun conversations. So who thinks Miroku (  Inuyasha  ) and Hoshi (  Enterprise  ) would make a cute couple?  *sighs* Baka (and I mean that in every possible usage of the word), you do realize that for any of us to understand, you're gonna have to be speaking English, "Ancient Egyptian", German, Italian, or maybe Spanish, possibly French. Some might remember bits and pieces of Latin. I'm very proud of knowing two words of Japanese. Any more and it's beyond me.

Hell's quite nice actually, little warm this time of year though, but overall nice.  oh and i have a question:   Watashi no ashi wa doko desu ka?

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:   You know what Vinnet... If i wanted to commit suicide i would go to Port Royale.  Rum is not suicide!  And you have somewhat contradicted yourself by saying that it is OK for CJ to drink beer, savvy?  They both do the same thing!   Elizabeth:  Jack does have a point.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  CAPTAIN, love.   Elizabeth:  Whatever.  And on Jacks behalf he is not an uncivilized being.  He dosent kill without a good reason.  He saved Will and I in a very smart manner.  He is human, like the rest of us and he makes mistakes, just more than the rest of us.  I am calling off the vote for rum.  Plus, if Jack dosent talk about rum how else are all these fun conversations going to start.   CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:   She finally sides with me *breaks into song* hallelujah, hallelujah _____   Elizabeth:  I can recant my words in a second, Sparrow  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  Shuting up, love ^_^

      SARAH:  Hey, long time no write! Sorry 'bout that; my e-mail's a little goofy at the moment, so I forgot about blogger for a while. Then Jack Sparrow was talking to me this morning, so I figured I'd better get on!     I do my best to avoid such a situation.    *stares* Don't talk about Star Wars with Teal'c? You kidding? That would be awesome, though I have to admit he could hardly know anything about it if he's seen only the movies. That's like just meeting me and not Miss V.   Somehow, I have a feeling he'd have your ass for it only if you got it from the SGC. Now, if you just happened to acquire some explosive material from, say, some rogue NID operation, I don't think anyone would mind.  OH, I know why, K: he e-mailed it in to this cool address that has my name in it. It might could supposed to be something like (Jack's screen name).scifianime@blogger.com or something...  ...No comment to Muiya.   No one is getting any money for alcohol from me unless it's Jack for some going away party for Hammond.   Sheesh! Even the proper British person can't speak proper English!!!  Yay! Go 'Beth Swann! (Hey, that's my middle name!)  "A dark cave far, far away"? DA da da da...! *breaks out into humming the Star Wars theme then changes to Weird Al's parody of "American Pie"* A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away, Nabo--    Please excuse my host's vague references to antiquated movies.     Lesse... On the issue of trading rum... Nay.    Nanei.    On the issue of drinking rum... Nein.    No!    On the issue of talking about rum on this blog... I'm rather indifferent.    No. We are all civilized beings, with the possible exception of the pirate and the demons. There is no reason for us to discuss an effective suicide method.     *Glares at Baka and K.*  Muiya: you kinda have to read it daily in order to not get lost. That and sit in at the lunch table. It helps to know everyone. Wow. I have connections!  Uh, K: Tortuga is where the rum is. Even I know that! Ah! Evil history classes!  Hey, Church. Sorry about the whole death talks, but for one, you weren't here. For two... Some of them have been dead, and well, it really can't be that bad if all your affairs are in order. It's gotta be either blackness, nothingness, in which you can't think and therefore can't care about not being able to think   or   a bright light at the end of a tunnel with general happiness. Unless your affairs aren't in order. Forgive me for the pun, but...   CHURCH.     Okay. I think I'm finally done now.

      Church: Hi, I'm Pvt L.L. Church from the popular web series, Red vs Blue. But I don't come here today as a famous actor, who happens to be really  really  handsome, I come here today because I was invited to this blog, which I've read through and let me just say I find your views on death very offensive. I mean it's bad enough that I'm dead, but for you to rub it in my face like that, it's just mean. Anyway, I've been sporting this light blue armor since my days on Sidewinder, and now I spend my time at Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha, in the Blue Army... Obviously (blue armor).

      (I am adding a new character.  I just think it would be fun to have another girl)  Elizabeth Swann:   Good day to you all.  I hope that you will except me into your chat.  I should probably read so i can establish who everyone is.   *reading ... stops abruptly when she sees Jack*  Oh no, Jack Sparrow!  Mr. Sparrow i do not apreciate you using me in referance to scare someone away from calling you captain.  I am not a scary person, and if you ever payed an ounce of attention you would see that.  Furthermore, i burnt the Rum to save our lifes.  That includes you!  And just in case you have forgoten, which it looks like you have, Rum is a vile drink that can turn even the most respectable men into complete scoundrals.  I agree with Sarah in that Rum is vile and i believe that the talk of Rum and panhandling of money for it should be illegal in this blog. *breathing heavily*  For the rest of you i bid good day.

Were you insulting me?!   &nbsp;   Definately some things you never *ever* do to a guy. Even the Evil snakes know that.   &nbsp;   I agree, Reeses, they are slightly scary.

Then he flies face-first into the ground and stays there, unable to get up.*  Sparrow? Are you okay?  Anyway, what's this about heaven going backrupt? Isn't that rather contradictive? I mean, with the whole thing about not serving two masters, you can serve either God or Money, so wouldn't there be no money in heaven?  You know, Buddha, I'm not a particular fan of yours, but for Mr. K's sake, if you need me to lend you about 573 yen with a few Greek coins thrown in....

Im gonna go crawl in a cave and eat chikenwings for the rest of my life. *leaves*  Inuyasha:  Good  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I second that.  Elizabeth: Hey, be nice.    Inuyasha: NO  Elizabeth: *advances toward inuyasha*  Inuyasha: *grabs for tethsusiga but it is not there and gulps*  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: *anouncer voice*  And in this corner, mates we have the lovely, yet scary Elizabeth.  And in the other corner we have the ruggedly handsome - not as ruggedly handsome as me, savvy? - Inuyasha! And their off.  Elizabeth jumps at Inuyasha.  They stare ate each other for a moment.  Elizabeth kicks and ...owch *Inuyasha falls*  Why did you go do that?  That is a very week spot, love! Its not fair, savvy!  Elizabeth:  Can it, Sparrow or you will get the same!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: *crickets chirp*

      Inuyasha: I wish i had my tetsusiga, i'd show that woman!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: That would be bad, mate.  Inuyasha: Why?  Jenn: *imitating Jack Sparrow* Because,even if we killed Elizabeth, the sarcophagus that Sarah talks about could come in to the picture, savvy?  And Elizabeth would possibly get even if we killed her, mate.  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: probably. If your going to imitate me, do it right, lass  Jenn: Possibly!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Probably!!  Jenn: POSSIBLY!!!!!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: PROBABLY!!!!!!!!!!!  Jenn: I know.  Inuyasha: well if you knew then why did you argue  Jenn: A) I felt like it, B)You do it with kagome all the time, and C)Jack is Cute when he gets angry  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: *glares then sits down and sharpens sword*  Jenn: is that a threat?  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Are you taking it as such, love  Jenn: well how am i supposed to know if it is or isnt if you dont tell me.   Im not that smart.  Inuyaha: clearly *whispered*  Jenn: you are lucky you are cute, you both are! HUMPH! *stomps away the way only a teenager could*

Kuronue:  *to Inu-Yasha*  In other words, there is no relation.

      CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  I agree with Sarah.  We need another person that is...well...more sane than the rest of us.  A voice of wisdom, and common sence.   Sydney Carton: Good day.   Jenn: A Tale of Two Cities is haunting me!!!!! But i dont mind.  Carton: A Tale of Two Cities?  Jenn: The book by charles dickens that depicts the crulties toward the French Nobility during the french revelution.  You are one of the main characters.  Carton: I see.  Well, like Church i find the views about death very disterbing since i am dead.  Although at least i have my head, as it were, on.  Jenn: Thats good to know, expesially since you were beheaded.  Inuyasha: Ouch!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Good Day, mate.  Jenn: I am wondering, when i read the book i pictured Sydney Carton as rather like a proper Jack Sparrow.  Which means that he looks like Johnny Depp.  Which means that these two, Sparrow and Carton, look almost identical.  Inuyasha: I see it!   Carton: Weird!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Totally!

He's a super evil bad dude.  I can't wait, I want to get Volume Three!  I want to see what Goku looks like in his demon form!  Goku:  What!?  How'd you know about that!?  Baka:  Um...  *starts waving watch in front of Goku's face*  You are getting sleepy.  You are getting sleepy.  Goku:  *grabs watch and throws it across the room**agitated*  How do you know?

      Sarah:  Not to sound callous or anything, but... Thank goodness they're gone! Why India? Don't they want to see Disney World?  I'm disappointed. You've got the words wrong. It's "When the big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"   *grins facetiously before breaking out into song*  "Hold the milk, put back the sugar; they are powerless to console! We're gathered here to sprinkle ashes  from our late friend's cereal bowl!  Breakfast clubbers say the motto that he taught us to repeat: "You will lose it in your gym class if you wait 'til noon to eat."  Back when the chess club said our eggs were soft,  every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft. Oh, none of us knew his check-out time would come so soon, but before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:  When the toast is burned and all the milk has turned and Captain Crunch is waving farewell, when the Big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"  *whips out shiney/fingerprinted guitar (and green pick) and starts playing the guitar solo, ending the whole facade in a four-string G chord*

      Sarah:  Oh, okay. I think I've got it, Sparrow. You never want me to say "sit" *He flies into the ground* again. :D  Mr. K, has your Christian buddy not had any influence on you? Stealing is BAD. Violence is BAD. Drugs are BAD. (Sorry, I've had my chocolate today.    Unfortunately.   )  Yeah, I'm shuddering, too. Alim'to is like braces. No one should have to go through that.    It's highly nutritional, though. You Tau'ri put too much stock in taste.     I see. Maybe we could have done without the fronkeys. To be truthful, the angels described in the Bible sound just as freaky-looking.  *Sees what Elizabeth did to Jack and helps him up.* What you do to these poor people trying to make an honest living!  *sics Garshie, a black husky mix, on Inuyasha* You know what, dog face? I like Jenn. I think she's got a great sense of humor. I'm not going to let you insult her, got it, mutt-boy? I think you're cute and all, but I'm not letting that get in my way. *Garshie chomps down on InuYasha's puffy red pants and doesn't let go, despite the half-demon's flailing.* And don't you dare laugh, Sparrow, or you're next. Garshie isn't quite as tame as he looks!  Umm... Church? You alright?  Wait, a   demon   likes the X-files? *rolling on the floor, laughing. Garshie returns to sniff Sarah's face.*  *Sarah composes herself.* I like your Jack Sparrow accent, Jenn. It's better than mine!  Alright. Sorry to be rude and all, but who invited all of you? (Hakkai, Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo, and for the most part, Buddha)  Oh, food's the problem? *whips out several unmarked plastic bags with mushy stuff like grits and chicken salad in them* If you're really hungry, the base cafeteria insisted I bring some of this home. I don't really like it, so you're more than welcome to take the whole stock. *whips out chocolate bar and starts to eat it* This is more my    *spits out chocolate* I will   not   have any of that near me!!!    C'mon, Vinnet? I'll let you eat some peanut butter when we get home....    Fine. *pouts* As long as I can eat enough to rinse the poison from my mouth.    Um, Vinnet? It's   my   mouth. I hope you realize that.  How nice of you guys to play two of my favorite classic rock songs! Anyone know "Breakfast" or other Newsboys songs? The really famous Switchfoot song? Audio A?  Well, um, Jenn... I've heard you sing a little....  Wow!! Mr. K, you know a word I don't know! Happy, happy! You should be chuffed!

All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity.  Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind.  Same old song just a drop of water in an endless sea. All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.  Now, don't hang on. Nothing lasts forever, but the earth and sky. It slips away and all your money won't another minute buy.  Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind. Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind. Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.  Lindsay:  I would like to apologize to Kansas for the poor lyrics, but I had to write them from memory and I'm not sure if that is really what it looks like.  *shruggs**disappears*

      Baka:  *sitting on the floor**Lindsay dictating through Baka*  Kurama was, is, a fox demon from the Makai.  He's over three hundred years old.  The same can be said for Kuronue, except he's a bat demon.  Kuronue was killed long ago when the both of them were fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  Kurama continued to steal, until approximately fifteen years ago he was running from spirit hunters and was blasted to the Human World, supposed dead.  He then took the form of a human child named Suichi Minamino and repented for his sins.  Kurama used to have long white hair and ears like you Inu-Yasha, even yellow eyes, but he had a tail.  Now he resembles a human boy with long red hair and bright green eyes.  I believe you also are shorter, aren't you?  *Kurama nods*  He is unable to turn back into Yoko Kurama, his demon form, because he lacks the energy.  He can transform, however, with the aid of specific spirit items like the Idunn Box.  Kuronue:  Been busy while I was in Hell, eh?  Kurama:  You have no idea.  Kuronue:  How does she know all of that?  Baka (not Lindsay any more):  Let's just say you two have a really, REALLY big fan in the real world.

No one really knows why they faint at random moments.  Kuronue:  (Back on the scene and looking...the same as he always did, but feelin' smooth)  *looks at Kurama*  Who the hell are you?  Kurama:  You should know.  Kuronue:  *stares at Kurama for a bit**cautiously*  Kurama...?  Kurama:  Indeed.  Kuronue:  You look different with red hair.  Baka:  *suddenly waking up from her spell**looks at Kurama, then Kuronue*  I see I have some explaining to do.  *the two other demons (excluding Inu-Yasha{no offense}) stare at Baka*

      Kurama:  *pulls hand from Baka's grip**sighs*  Baka knows very well that I already have a girlfriend.  It's her cousin, Daisuko.  Baka:  *quietly steams in anger**mumbling*  I hate her.  I hate her.  I hate her.  I hate her.  *a red and black shoe flies through the air and hits Baka in the head*  Baka:  *falls down*  What the...?!  Kurama:  *helps Baka to her feet*  That always seems to happen to Baka even when Dais is far away.  *somewhere far away*  Yusuke:  *looking at Dais' foot*  What happened to your shoe?  Dais:  Baka must have been drooling over Kurama again.  Kuwabara:  Is her real name Baka?  Dais:  Yeah, numb nuts, and she's a lot smarter than you.  *Kuwabara glares at the youkai stupidly*  *back to the chat*  Baka:  Feh.  Jenn:  Aww!  Baka looks so cute when she's pouting.  Baka:  Shut up!  *mumbles*  I can hear you, you know.

      Sarah:  Now, Baka, don't make me use your name. You need to exhibit the same drool-restraint that Jenn has toward Captain Sparrow. (Meaning: just like Jenn doesn't drool over Sparrow, don't drool over Kurama. He won't like you if you do.)

      Carton: Baka, i find that when you like sombody it is best to tell them rather then flirting.  Altough i did live during the 1700's.  Jenn: Awww...but inuyasha is so cute when he flirts  Inuyasha: I dont flirt, i yell  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:  We covered this already.  Yo flirt with Kagome by yelling ...  Jenn: more like being yelled at.

Kurama:  *reading Baka's first statement*  What is "Furuba"?  Baka:  It's short for Fruits Basket.  Your voice is featured on the anime.  Kurama:  What?  Baka:  You're Sohma Shigure!

Jenn: What is "that"  Inuyasha: a word  Jenn NO, the "that that" you are all talking about  Elizabeth: Oh that  Carton:&nbsp; nothing  Jenn: how can it be "nothing" if you are saying it happens  Inuyasha: its over, so now it is nothing  Jenn: But i want to know what it, or "that", is  Carton: You said you read ATOTC- you figure it out  Jenn: grrrr *storms out*  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow:&nbsp;finally we got her to leave&nbsp;*safe comes down (like in cartoons) and hits Jack in the head*

       Baka:&nbsp; That made sense to me.     &nbsp;   *turns to Lindsay*     &nbsp;   So I guess that means we both have supreme power.     &nbsp;   Lindsay:&nbsp; Someone has to go back to the real world, and, considering your physical...condition, I guess it's me.     &nbsp;   Kurama:&nbsp; Aren't you one and the same person?     &nbsp;   Baka    and    Lindsay:&nbsp;   It's a paradox that is really complicated to understand.     *Kurama nods in understanding*

Baka:&nbsp; When'd you get back?     &nbsp;     Kuronue:&nbsp; Ask the person who is up at 12:30 in the morning writing on this thing without her parents knowing.     Lindsay:&nbsp; (Another camio appearance by the slealty spy)&nbsp; I am a spy, I sneak around at night.     &nbsp;   Baka:&nbsp; Did we really need a narration?     &nbsp;   Kurama:&nbsp; But it's morning.     &nbsp;   Lindsay:&nbsp; You know I have ultimate power over you and can easily do something  bad  to you?     &nbsp;   Baka:&nbsp; Ah, but I also have supreme power here, because I am the registered user.     &nbsp;   *Lindsay glares darkly at the bitailed demon*

I really haven't been around that much violence, but I've been shot in the leg once and zatted, let's see, at least twice, probably more.     &nbsp;   Vinnet: My host thinks she's been though so much. I have been shot a couple times by staff weapons, once by a weapon of the Tau'ri,     and countless times by zatn'katel.        &nbsp;  Sarah: Well, technically, it was her hosts getting shot, not she. *senses Vinnet's temper rising* But, you know, symbiotes feel every bit of the pain hosts perceive. *Vinnet seems satisfied*      &nbsp;

       Sarah:&nbsp; And nobody has good grammer. Sheesh, people! I mean, I know half of you are from earlier years/alternate realities, but that's really no excuse for not knowing how to speak in proper English!    Khala: What about me?    Sarah: *nods head* Okay, well, you  do  have an excuse, considering you're not really from Earth at all, but... I just kinda figured that most Tok'ra instinctively knew English. I guess if I really think about it, though, they (or y'all) weren't here for the Battle of Hastings in 1066, when English became greatly influenced by French for 1550, when English went though the great vowel change. It's a wonder all Tok'ra and Goa'uld don't speak Old English...    &nbsp;   Vinnet: My host does not realize that all are not as interested in etymology as she.       &nbsp;  Sarah: Well, I  technically, consciously  realize it, but convincing my inner self... *considers Vinnet* my  other  inner self, takes some doing.   Wow. That's surpisingly little for how much I've missed. Guess there wasn't much to comment on this time around. *glances around room*   Oh, I want you all to meet one of the newer Tok'ra, Khala. Why don't you introduce yourself?    &nbsp;  Khala: *nods* I am a Fremen from Arrakis, also known as Dune. Do not try to travel there; our Stargate has been sealed. I am certainly a new host for the Tok'ra. *eyes flash*    &nbsp;   Thellas: A word of caution concerning the antics presented here: my host has a short temper and an often-used knife. To anger her would not benefit your health.    *several gulps sound from around the room*   Sarah: But, you know, as long as we're all friends here, we shouldn't have any problems, right? *stares pointedly at Baka, Sparrow, and the K-people (Khala excluded)*

       Sarah: Well, I'm more than happy to tell you. I get used to this kind of thing, it being my job and all. Tok'ra (and Goa'uld) have naquada in their blood. Now, when other naquada is in the vacinity, the molecules polarize, positive end toward the source, sending a signal to the brain that there is naquada nearby in a particular direction. Since other Tok'ra, Goa'uld, and Jaffa, as well as those who were once one of the above have the naquada in them, they can be sensed by Tok'ra like myself and Khala.      Naquada was also a particular period in Ancient Egyptian history here on Earth. It's probably the era just before Ra's foothold in Egypt was overthrown and the Stargate buried.      Vinnet: This was all derived from Major Carter's research on the subject; we Tok'ra have neither the time nor interest for such matters. For us, it is not so much why we can sense each other as it is that we can.

      Kurama:  This is a strange plot twist for a story with no plot.  If you can consider this a story at all.  Dais:  This probably isn't my place to say, but I don't sense anything strange about this elf person except for the fact that he is an elf.  Baka:  We're not talking in terms of spirit energy Dai.

      There is a new rule :  No Evaluating your own stats. You always come out better that way, besides, your character is bound to die sooner or later (and believe me, it won't be later). This is not a story where the good-guys stay alive to whole time, you will have lots of chances at your characters, so&nbsp;I suggest you don't use your good ideas first.

       Talat of the Tanku Clans stats,    Numbers:15, 11, 13, 9, 13 and 15    &nbsp;    I'll place them like this    Str.13    Dex.15    Int.11    Wis.13    Con.9    Cha.15     &nbsp;   11 is the average of any stat (meaning an average person would have 11 as all stats)    Also for most races except human, there are stat bonuses, but not all bonuses are good. For example, &nbsp;Kinuka stat bonuses would go like this:     &nbsp;   Str.13 - 2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11  Dex.15 +1=&nbsp; 16  Int.11 -1=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10  Wis.13 +1=&nbsp; 14  Con.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9  Cha.15 +2=&nbsp; 17 &nbsp;

      Human: Human are... well human. There is nothing special they are good at, they can't fly,&nbsp; they're not too fast,&nbsp;and they aren't very complicated,&nbsp;so they are perfect for beginners.   Kinuka: Kinuka are a bird/man race made in the Halfman projects of the Ashta. They effectively&nbsp;look like angels,&nbsp; their average wingspan is twice their height, and their height ranges from 4'0" to 5'7". They escaped during the Halfmen project because of the Ashta's cruelty, and now, forever want revenge on them.   Fairies: Fairies are very different than they are in&nbsp;stories told now. They are not a small human with wings or "sprite",&nbsp;they are instead, a creature and a sprite (think Kokiri). There are three types of fairies, there are Forest fairies, Fire fairies, and Water fairies.   Forest Fairy: A forest fairy looks like no more than a child, that is because they age slowly, every hundred years, they seem to age one year, but they die when they have lived for 2000 years (20). They tend to be dexterous and intelligent, but not wise, (example, fairy and bear, fairy: *pokes bear*, bear: grrr!, fairy: *continually pokes bear*, bear: *mauls fairy*&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone else: lol, and so on.) Looks: (think kokiri)  Fire Fairy: (Think goron) These specialize in strength, seeing that they are pretty much made of rock. They can curl up and send a chemical through their veins making them glow, making&nbsp;themselves look like cooling lava. Their height ranges 5'8" to 7'3.  Water Fairy: (think zora)&nbsp; Also called Sylphin, Another halfmen, fish/man. They excel in wisdom and intelligence. They are amfibious and prefer water above land, but can live on land for three days.&nbsp;Height ranges from 3'4" to 7'8".  These are your current choices, later there will be more.

       An introduction to the Harm Not blog. This is an RPG, Pen and Paper, over the internet, if you want to join, just email or IM me&nbsp;and ask. Anyway, this is a rather loose ruled game to allow maximum... things you can do. Here are the rules, no swearing, no innuendo... That's pretty much it. Now, Here is how the game is played, There is a team, each character in said team has his/her own individual stats. Those will be rolled by me and you will choose which stat the number will go under. The stats are Str.=Strength (power of attack, how much you can lift, etc.), Dex.=Dexterity (speed, ability w/ weaponry, etc.), Con=Constitution/health (affect defense, affects effects of poison, etc.), Int=intelligence (Book smarts/How much you know), Wis=Wisdom (Street Smarts/Using knowledge), and finally, Cha=Charisma (speech ability, the way you look).&nbsp; You start at level 1 and you can gain levels when you get a certain amount&nbsp;of Exp.=experiance points. Every level you gain, you get to add 1 stat point to a stat of your choice.The game play will go like this, you tell me what you do, I tell you what happens. This is based in the same story as   urlLink  The Journals of Weird Kendo Guy.    Hope you enjoy.

      You are at the entrance of a city, a large city called Toma Attaku. By the looks of it, you might say it were an old Japanese style city, in the center of the city is a military base, one of the largest in the world. You know this, of course, because you just came from there. You are now new members of the Suitoi. As your first official mission, you have been ordered to escort Talat of the Tanku clan to a city called Hanat, which has been under constant attack by the Ashta. When you get there, what you do is for you to decide. As you look around you see a short man with wings wearing a white robe, of course with holes for his wings, and in his right hand is a bow, in his left, the string. A small metal talon gripping a marble hangs from a string on his neck. (you can interact with your surroundings now)

       Don't worry about the Dwhatevers, that's for me, you don't even have to know what it means, but if you want to know, D6 means I roll a 6-sided die, D8=8-sided and so on, usually for damage. Also, don't worry, you'll run into food almost every day, it's the most common encounter.

      Ow. Okay. Seriously, I can't imagine doing archery without the glove thing, but then... I guess if Marja practices daily, she has callouses like I have from guitar. Might not need it after all. Logic is the only necessary item! Mwa ha ha ha! I suppose D8 is defense? Remember, I'm new to this!  Just to finalize this, she carries a bow and twenty arrows, a ring, and an arm guard. (Should probably have thrown some kind of sustenence in there, too, but all well.)  Strength ____12 Dexterity ___14 Constitution _13 Intelligence __13 Wisdom  ____12 Charisma ___11

       Nice character. Here are the stats place them where you'd like: 12, 14, 12, 13, 13, 11. You can have the bow, and arrows (x20 same as weirdkendogirl)(D8) and there are no laser weapons (as far as you know) but there are plasma weapons you might be able to pick up later. You can have the arm guard and and the ring, not the glove though (remember anything you didn't get now you can most likely get later -applies to all).

      (I'll just use an old idea first. Ezo was originally supposed to be an alien from a water planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, but I never got around to writing it. It's a great name, though.)  Character Name: Marja Hav Character Gender: Female Character Age: 23 Character Race: Human  Character Weapon request: Well, I know this is a long shot, but... are there any laser weapons availible? Either way, she uses a dark blue bow, a simple one about three feet long with a resistance between fifteen and twenty pounds.  The arrows are about 2 1/2 feet long with three feathers eight inches long ('bout twice as long as regular feathers). The tip is quite long and smooth. No jagged points, which are common to hunting arrows.   Height: 7' 4" Eye color: Bright, solid green Hair color: a darker shade of blonde. Not white/bleached, but not necessarily on the brown end of things, either. (Comes halfway down her back, if you're interested, usually worn in a loose ponytail at the back of her neck.)  Item request: As a complement to the bow, she carries a leather arm protector thing (I don't know what it's technically called, but I find it useful.)  I suppose she also uses a kind of three-fingered glove contraption to protect her fingers after prolongued archery sessions. A ring.  Character Description: She generally wears flowing clothing, nothing especially stiff. Most days, she dawns dark blue or green shirts with fairly high necklines and long, flaring sleeves. Her pants are similarly designed; a tight-fitting waist with a slight flare at the bottom. All this is generally worn over a tighter fitting suit that she swims in. She grew up by the sea, swimming as much as possible in the cracks in a strenuous study schedule. She loves the water to the point where she would not love it unless it was deemed absolutely necessary. Her parents died when she was twelve, at which point she began to live with her family's friends, a kind of godparents relationship, if you will. She dropped her acedemic studies and began to train with her bow daily, the goal of killing those she suppects to be her parents' murderers constantly in her mind. At this point, her training was foremost in her mind, but she always resorted to the water when life seemed overwhelming. It was her peace. At the age of twenty-one, she left her new family's home, intent on finding the murderers she'd imagined for nine years. She didn't take much with her: her bow and accessories and her parents' single surviving gold wedding ring. Now, she hardly ever shows emotion. Her face isn't jovial. Ever. If any emotion is provoked, it's negative. Not many tell about that memory without pointing out a new scar or two and holding up some broken piece of an arrow, pulled from their skin.  Hope this is a good start, seeing that I'm new to this and all!

      Shaikonra lifted his arm, telling them to leave, but they refused. He then took action, but not in the same way that Haimanton had. Instead, a great cold breeze&nbsp;came about Haimanton as the robots sparked and began to melt. Suddenly,&nbsp;they flew back without even being touched.  "You're a... psyonisist." Haimanton stated, softly.  "Of course I am." Shaikonra unintentionally&nbsp;snapped back.  As they left the store, many police ran in to collect the androids and on the broken streets of Dailsa (pronounced like dale-sha), (The capitol of Gharsa, the capitol country&nbsp;of the Haikorui) many others were picking up parts of the robots. "Where are we going?" Haimanton looked up to Shaikonra and asked.  "You're going to get proper training with those things," Shaikonra replied, smiling. "What do you mean?" "I mean, prepare yourself for the military."

      A bystander realized what happened and stopped in his tracks. He walked into the weapons store, while listening to the repetitive, painful cries of 'I killed him'. A soft voice calmed the child slightly, the voice asked, "It's going to be alright, you killed no one."      But this confused the boy. "What do you mean 'no one'? Can't you see that man?"      The man looked up at the figure standing with a sword in its chest. "Look more carefully, kid." The man looked back down at the child, his light blue eyes seemed to pierce the child, calming him. The child gathered his strength and raised himself from the ground and examined the body. The body's pupils were red, something the boy had never realized before, Small openings that the sword had left revealed wiring inside the chest cavity. This man was no man; he was an android. This revelation cleansed the boy's conscience. He looked at the kodachi shoved in the humanoid's chest, then looked at his charred hand, and squeezed his arm in agony. He looked at the man and saw that he was pulling out a leather glove. He carefully pulled the sword out of the robot. "This seems to be your type of weapon." The man said to the child after great difficulty removing the weapon. "What's your name, kid." The man inquired. 'Haimanton' (hey-mon-t&#333;n) was the response. The man picked up the sheath and put the sword into it. Then took the other sword and sheath and did the same. "Where are your parents?" the man asked.       The answer next was unexpected "Dead, killed by Ashta scum."  The man looked curiously at Haimanton, "Killed by the radiation?"  The answer was abrupt, "No, they were killed just like this store clerk."After a long, awkward pause, the man tossed the swords at Haimanton.        "My name is Shaikonra (shy-con-ra), come with me." Haimanton reluctantly accepted the offer, but also added 'Shouldn't we pay for these' holding up the two kodachis. "You're an honest kid, Haimanton, I like that." Shaikonra replied taking a wallet out of his pocket, examining the price of the items, and left the money where they used to lie. Haimanton and Shaikonra began to leave the store as another group of androids entered.

      An electronic bell rung as the child entered the shop. He had short red hair, and his green eyes glittered with the reflection of light from a pair of weapons that caught his attention from outside the store, two kodachis, swords about twice the size of his lower arm.  The child stared at the two swords for about five minutes before he was asked to leave the store. The boy agreed half heartedly, but while leaving, never took his eyes of the display case. This, of course, led him to walk backwards, which in turn, led him to run into a man entering the store. "Watch where your goin' kid!" the man shouted and promptly shoved him out of the store. The child watched as the man drew out a gun and began to violently fire at the shop clerk. The boy watched wide-eyed; this was not the first time he had seen this happen. He knew he needed to take action, but what could he do? He remembered the swords. All he needed to do was get to them. He ran into the store. The man turned around, his stare felt as if he weren't even human. The child quickly ran for the glass display case. Unfortunately, the man stood between him and his weaponry, and was caught by the man. His left arm was pinned to his body, but his right arm was free, and his feet were still on the ground. He struggled to get free, but the man's grip was too tight, so he did the only thing he could; he began to flail wildly in the direction of the case. The case broke with one swift kick. He laughed in victory as he was just in reach to grab one of the swords with his free hand. He held the sword as tight as he could and thrust it backward, into the man's chest. The man's arms went limp, but the man remained standing. The child began to pull his newfound weaponry out of the man's chest, but he got no further than halfway out when a sharp pain lodged itself in his hand and crept its way up his arm. He tried to let go of the blade, but his attempts were in vain. He let out a shout of pain, as he gathered his strength and with one quick movement, jerked his hand off the metal hilt of the sword. He lay, sprawled on the floor, gripping his arm in pain. A large black burn remained on his hand.

      Earth - More than 1,000 years from now... The Haikorui (pronounced hey-c&#333;-roy) the world government, which united the world's countries, save a few resistors, had been at war with the Souchui (so-choy) the group of resistors that wishes division for the united Earth. A larger group helps the Souchui, this group is called the Ashta. The Ashta is a scientific group that had been kicked out of the UESA (United-Earth Science Association) multiple times for cruelty to wildlife and  Humans  in experiments such as the Half-Man Project, which sprouted new races such as the Kinuka (key-new-ca), half human, half bird, and the Sylphin (See-fen), half human, half fish. The Ashta always rose to a new height of technology, and always a new low of inhumanity. But for every evil there is an opposing good, and that good was the Suitoi (soy-tee). The Suitoi was mainly made up of people that had mutated during the nuclear war known as World War IV, in which some crops acquired radiation, killing many people before scientists figured out how to cure people of this radiation. A new chemical had been discovered that would neutralize that specific radiation. It was called Psythene, but it caused a change in the human body enabling many people to use a sort of psychokinesis. This ability was called psyonics...

      This is not actually a journal, nor is it written in journal form. Instead, it is a collection of ideas I have for a story, a Sci-Fi story based off a pen and paper RPG I made. This section of the story is based around one kid named Haimanton (pronounced like hey-mon-tōn) later nicknamed Weird Kendo Guy. I hope you enjoy.

      The bunkhouse seemed lifeless as they entered, despite the dozen inside. The dozen was made up of five children, about Haimanton's age (no doubt all were orphans like Haimanton) and seven young men, that all looked at Haimanton as if he were a freak. The young boy merely held closer to his kodachis and glared at everyone inside. A small whisper came about the room as if wind, and was gone just as quick, but Haimanton remained quiet and still. If not for the color in his body, one might have mistaken him for a statue. "This is Haimanton." Shaikonra finally broke the eerie silence. "I trust you will take care of him like any other rookie." Another whisper came and fell like the last, quiet snickering could be heard throughout the room. Shaikonra gave Haimanton a shove, and instantly, the door shut behind him. There was now no way out, and nothing standing between him and the rest of the inhabitants of the bunkhouse. It wasn't long before one of the men got to his feet, and walked up to the child. He looked at Haimanton, up and down, inspecting him, memorizing him, trying to find possible weaknesses. "I'm Karugh (cā-rook)," the man said with a rough voice. "I'm the drill leader of this bunkhouse." Haimanton instinctively reached out to shake his hand, in hopes that his wish to make peace would be accepted, but this gesture was immediately rebuked with a, "Don't be stupid," from Karugh. "There's one rule in this bunk, and that's that I'm in charge, everything I say, goes," is what he tried to say, but half way through this speech of his mouth closed shut, and laughter from the children's side of the room soon followed. One child, a Pyrod (pī-rōd, half man, half feline), stopped laughing, though, as he was pulled through the air, and stopped in front of Karugh. Karugh's mouth reopened, and the first this out of it was "I've had enough of this from you, Garruw (Gār-roo)!" Garruw hung in the air, looking quite comfortable, a large grin stretched across his face. He glanced at Haimanton almost as if to say, 'This better be worth it,' then set his focus back on Karugh.

       Sorry about all the confusing names and stuff, the reason it's all weird and stuff is because it's not in English. Instead, it is in a common tongue that I do not yet have a name for. Also, all the ai=ey and stuff is because the language has its own symbols, that is supposed to be a type of phonetic spelling. And don't ask about the oi=ee thing, I don't know what I was thinking, but that's the way it is now. I can't change it. Oh, and Shaikonra's name is pronounced different for a reason, you'll find out later.
