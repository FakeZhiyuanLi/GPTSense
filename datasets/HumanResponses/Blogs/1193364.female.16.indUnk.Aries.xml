       urlLink Pseudo Stars.   Oh that's my blog. Bookmark me, k? Well, I've got work to do mostly for Coach Waters. And some for Mrs. Heffner, and I'm sure that Mr.Huff gave me some work. But, oh well. You know? I'm such a slacker. But, I don't care all too much. Bah. Who does?  Well, for those of you that don't know I've been writing a lot of poems lately, and it's mainly because of personal reasons. Only like, well, three people that know those reason have read it, and two that don't. So, about five, without the family counting. w00t. I like it, but It will never be posted unless I'm totally sure no one reads this ever. Advisors tell me it seems to make me appear very bitter. Although, they deny it, I agree, I am bitter. And a bit jaded. But, hey, have you seen my art lately? Have you read my book lately? Being Jaded like this can rock some hard ass. I mean, oh well, I have issues with getting close to people now. They can really get over it. It's just hard, because I hardly have trust in people and the human race in general. Who cares though? It's my issue, I've got a couple, I'll deal. Everyone around me will deal. Bleh, so, screw you people that don't.   You all know I love you, for the most part. And I say for the most part because, I like half of you a lot more than you deserve. That's mainly because I know I get annoyed a lot quicker than I used to. but, I changed a lot, and so did everyone else, if you ask me. I won't list the ways, but they did. And I did. And I'm happy with the change! So nah!   Oh, Progress Reports. Let's not go there. Heck, I'm doing all right, but not as good as I should be. Ah, tainted playlist. Well, not as good as I should be, is like B-ish. And I have a 99 in art. Oh wow. Unexpected. I'm a terrible artist, but whatever. Okay not terrible, but I'm not the best either. Anyway, I'm going to move on.  ANNA LOVES AB-BOY!!  It is so damn obvious. I swear, they are so going to start dating senior year. She is so in love with him, or his abs as she says. I tease her. Just like I tease her about everything else in the world. I get my fairshare of it too. Yeah, thanks for the nickname guys. 'Gibbs'? Seriously. Call me Carebear. Or Ephie. Or something better than Gibbs. Please, people, we need new nickname skills. Let's get lives, all of us. Together. w00t.    For all of you reading this know that you are subjected to be vented upon. So here is a vent now. I'm sort of annoyed with Anna. She totally blocked me, and up, I dunno why. I'm wondering what I did wrong this time. I wonder if she has an idea. i think she might be telling me to go away. Wai.  A loss of a best friend. Nothing said from Anna, as of yet, along she is working on her homework, unlike procrastinating me. But that's okay, I'm allowed to. I mean, WAI! Why is Anna hating! Annoyance factor rising.  Tell me Anna!! C'mon! You're mah bestest friend, please?  Also, Coach Waters, which is mainly a daily vent. WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS INFERNAL WORK!! That's all I really have to say. It just annoying. I thought I was going to do a report on the Gods and Goddess of Greece, not the Persian Wars. The Persian Wars. Ah, let me give you a run down. 1. They happened somewhere between 492 B.C. and 479 B.C.  2. The people in it had odd names 3. There are multiple King Darius..eis... 4. The people have dumb names. 5. It wasn't important enough to be made into a movie, like The Trojan Wars. Which is also a condom brand.  6. If there was a movie, it wouldn't have Viggo, Orli, Brad Pitt, or anyone cool in it.  7. It's dumb! I mean, really! WHO CARES?! They don't even have a condom named after the wars. The Trojan War must have been a war of sex or something. Stupid Persian wars, no great sex.   Anyway, enough of that.  Daily Update!  [Music] - [Flavor of the Week]- American Hi-Fi [Mood]- [Decent] [Game]-  erm...None.    Gripe of the Day.  Papers Coach Waters gives.

      Well, this is like my first post. I'm not too sure what all to say, but you know, Josh better hurry up with the layout. Because, I hate waiting for it. I also really need some sort of photoshop or adobe? Yes, please, thankies, It's needed badly. Enough about this crappy layout, here's the day. Period by period.  First Block: Honors L.A. - Mrs. Heffner. No Josh, and others, she isn't related to Hugh. Shove it. Well, we watched Lord of the Flies, the um, one from 1963, which totally kicked ass. It was riddled with comments from Anna, Nick, Duc, Tiffany, Courteny, David and myself. Yeah, although Duc fell alseep, along with Anna. I hit Anna a few times with my jacket until she stole it from with. Which left me freezing to death in my "I heart Nerds" shirt. Oh yeah, loads of fun. I think Duc likes Anna, just a thought. He's all tall and stuff. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the slackers, (which would be Anna and myself) were happily informed that our five paragraph essay wasn't due until thrusday. And that's why Mrs. Heffner rawks.   Second Block: Speech and Debate - Mr. Huff. For those of you that have heard me speak of Mr. Huff, let me infrom you that he rawks. He does scholars bowl, and he makes fun of us and them all the time. He had nicknames for everyone. You can't know mine, so don't bother asking, Bizznotch. So, we like talked about prejudice and like racist and biased jokes. Normal speech and debate stuff. It wasn't a very exciting class today. Well, I have homework for it. I mean, Mr. Huff always makes funny side comments. And everyone is really passionate, I mean, I am too, but they think about their points, I just kind of cover over what they said, it's annoying, and I don't like it. I mean, I can be smart, he even tells me I'm smart and that i have good points. Just, the thing is, so does everyone else, and they speak on impluse. I hate speaking on impluse, in front of a call. Embrsassment nation. Well, I'm a dork anyway. It doesn't matter all to much, I have a good grade in his class, and he'sa great teacher.   Third Block: Honors World History - Coach Waters. No wait, that's Coach Satan to you. He's like demon-nation man. He's a good teacher, I have really high marks in his class, it's just, he bugs me sometimes. He's one of those, "I'm the only teacher you have, and the only class you should care about is this one." kind of teacher. I mean, last time I checked, I had like a 90, but then i got a 99 on a project, and then a 50 on homework, and prolly a like 75 or 80 on a test, and then a 91 on this other test. And a 98 on theis work project thingie. Oh, he assigned another one. On Perisan Wars. Gag me. Please. His class is hades, I swear. I mean, whatever, he's just...arg, Evil. Well, I love to vent. But he really is. Anna and I goofed off all period in the Media Center. Jessie asked us about cheesecake with a pen up her nose. It's like she wants to belong, a bit sad, don't you think? I wish, she'd poof away, take some of her annoying followers with her. One more year, and she's gone. Thank you for high school drop outs.  Fourth Block: 2D-3D Design - Mrs. Neal. Oh, before fourth, Duc hugged Anna. I teased her. She so likes him. Duh. I hope Anna doesn't read this. I LOVE YOU ANNA!! So this is the end of the day. I ended up with a headache at the beginning of class arguing with Jon about who this drummer kid was. I had no idea what he looked like, or who he was. Whatever though, I stopped after a while. Jon, Jimmy and myself carried on a convo about me lacking a boyfriend. Thanks guys, that put a real damper on my day. But you know, I told Jimmy what I was looking for in a guy, including brains, which is a major must-have, and he told me he knew someone. I sort of gasped. I wrote my numbers down and gave them to Jimmy. It's a Parkview dude, but he's like a juinor, I think. Or a Sophomore with a car. Yes, he's got a car. Cha-chingy. Someone cashed in, and I think it was me.    Well, the only other thing is tonight is the Season Premire of EVERWOOD!! EEeeep!! I'm so excited!! I can't wait, so i'm trying to get some sleep. I know you see how well that's working out. That and a layout. I can't expect much of Josh though, he's a lazy ass gifted kid with too much homework. Get a life Josh, get a life. Get a life and throw a party. And finish my layout. Oi vey, so tired. Here's an update:  Music: Gob -Lemon-aid Mood: Excited and overly tired. Game: Poker, still.    Lastly, The GRIPE OF THE DAY, the title is thanks to RFR, watch it in the n. Check out the n at www.the-n.com  Gripe:  Annoying people that are..annoying to say the least. Find your own examples, I have mine.  Wait one more. Quote of the Day or week, or whatever. "Be yourself, no one else wants to be." -Me.   Okies, Micheal, you're a dumb. It's JOO!!

      More to life.   Is it easy to say when you see yourself being hated, that you very well might be? It's sort of sad to view it like this, but it seriously could be true, couldn't it? Sometimes, and mostly when your in high school, you see yourself as always being judged. Now, what if your friends did this judging to you? I'm not all too sure where I'm headed with this, but, I'm sure you'll see this. For some reason, I'm feeling left out from "Haterfest '03!".  I have NO idea why. Okay, maybe it's because a lot of my friends are there, but some of them aren't. What of them? I'm just being how I was born to be. Except, I was invited. I just thought it would be logically to go to sleep early and then, you know, go to movies on Sunday, seeing as I have a meet tomorrow. It just had planned to go see a movie with Alex, Jared and Anna. But it's empty. I know half, or more, of the people at Homestaying think I'm a self-rightous bitch. Okay, I'm not saying I'm not, becasue you know what? I am. But it is so worse when other people tell you that you are. It's just annoying, so I should be glad I'm not going. Okay, wait, this started out as a drespressing post, and now it's like "I'm happy I'm not going."...I call it horomones, mood swings, whatever you want. But I do feel okay that I'm not going. I don't really need to surround myself with the large amount of idiots that will be present, do I? I think not. Plus, it's not like Jessie cares if I show up. So, it's more or less dejection. Oh. Dejection. Wow. Now I'm really happy about not going. I'm so odd. I never thougt I could, like do this, without the help of my shirk. I feel good. It's not like anyone wants to see me there anyway! It'd be like, breaking a taboo. Oh, well, does that mean I should? I could just see myself walking in and everything getting reeeeaallly silent suddenly. Wow....it's Ever After all over again, except, no prince, no di Vinici, no kick-ass costume, and no long hair...which would just strip the plot from that AWESOME movie anyway. I could compare it to The Princess Bride. Which would also kill that movie. Okay, Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail. Yeah, the part with the French people! The ones that throw the cow. Yeah. People throw cows at me. I'm such a sad person, seeing as I'm listening The Dead Alewives, and talking about Monty Python. And seeing as the skit was...McGregor Kilts, I suppose it wasn't that bad. Oh yeah, "Have fun sleeping."...piece of shit...    ...I need a punching bag....

      Cross Country and why it rocks.  Okay, today was a big hard and evil meet. We have them on Saturdays for the most part. I love to run, but meets are just terrible sometimes. too many hills, and then there are people that are like "Push it!!" and obviously you can't push it more becasue you are about to die and your legs feel like jello. Sometimes I feel like asking these people if they'd feel running this course. Mostly my sister who says that running 3.1 miles as fast as you can on a hilling and evil course is no excuse to be grouchy to her. It was like 50 degrees, and there were huge and evil hills. I would like to see her run that the whole time and PR (By the way, PR is Personal Record). She could, but it was so cold in Athens today...I didn't even want to run. So, the whole thing went more or less like this. A freezing warm-up, and a freezing run. It was terrible. And it was RAINING! Ick, it was gross. I PRed though. Which was a happy day. Everyone did awesome, and i was very happy with our JV team. Because....we got 3rd overall!! Out of 20 teams, which is like, moundo happiness.   YAY!! I'm meeting Tyler on Monday. Yay for me!   Oh, who's Tyler?   Tyler is my 17-year-old date to homecoming. He goes to Grayson. Which is pimpin' because, that means he doesn't go to Shiloh. So, McGeehin is picking me and him up, and....we're going to do something...ah well. That's the end of this blog. I'm so sleepy...time to sleep.  -Steph

      Annoyed, yes.   Ah, it's that time in every Shiloh students life that we all spend cramming for our exams. Our Midterm exams, the thing that can make your grade, or break your grade. So, right now, I'm sitting here listening to terrible music, and trying to cram info that I have no picked up over 9 1/2 weeks, without any of my notes, infact, without any information pretaining to the two WONDERFUL subjects in which I happen to have these exams in. Both of my core classes, with is like, so great, since they're on the same day. I can't complain too much. I mean, I'm reviewing for L.A.. And stuffing my mind of pointless history. Pointless history on pointless things I'll never need unless I'm on Jeapordy or I'm a histoian. Which means, God, save me from this class now. We all have those thoughts. But, since these 9 1/2 weeks went by so fast, what's to say the next 9 1/2 won't? Coach Waters, that's who. The satanic teacher that I have been oh-so-lucky to have teach me. As he reminds us daily, making us write long papers on relgions that we really don't care about. Making up do pointless speeches in class, for our peers to kindly sleep though.And then of course, there is the singling out and embrsassment of students, through a method he calls "Roulette". Sooner or later, I'm going to start playing that. With a gun. It's bad enough he's my World History teacher, making it impossible for me to get an A, he has to be at every Cross Country meet ever. His daughter runs. Comparison is never fun, and when you're slow, it's worse. It's bad enough I suck period, comparison is even worse. I've already measured up slow to the other 40-something girls on the team, why compare more? Because, it's a torture method. The only perk about this class is having Anna in there with me.  See, the thing with that is this. Anna and I had no classes together for the first...3 days. No lunch, we weren't even on halls close together. Then one day, Anna shows up in my first block. And then we have thrid together. We are...happy...about that.   Anyway. Hey, write me, and I'll be sure to answer. Gotta Gripe? Please, feel free to share.   Ja-na!

      Keep bleeding your fake blood.    I'm morally annoyed right now, you know. I'm just sitting at my computer like, extremely ill. I've got this fever, and I'm freezing my ass off in flannel. So, I decided that answering IMs isn't something I want to do. So, I put up an away message, and miss CASEY! 8 times. And I don't know his number, and I want to call him, and talk to him, but he's going golfing and i don't have my phone, GOSH!! This day SUCKS! Anyway, I was going to tell the world what I was getting Casey for Christmas, but, he told me he reads, so, sorry baby, you don't get to know. It's friday, the 28th. Which means, on Sunday, is....my one month! This is my...3rd relationship that has lasted over a month. Go me! Boys are so hard like that, you have to do stuff...wait, not like that. Gosh, nevermind, you sick freaks. Anyway, this is the three is my lucky number. I think. No, it is, and Casey is an amazing great guy. Yes, Alex, he is up to your standards, and your's to Nataku, and my father even likes him, even though Casey drives. It's a miracle that my parents trust me this much. Anyway....wasn't I GRIPING?!    I forgot my point....   Well anyway. While I was up late, coughing up my guts, I watched a great movie with Kevin Kline. "The Emperor's Club." IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THAT MOVIE SEE IT!! It is a great piece of work, and I loved it. It think it was one of like....three movies I cried during. One being "Remember the Titans.", and then "Divine Secerts of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." and now "The Emperor's Club." It is a guy movie, in fact, it is about a boy's school during the 70's. Kevin Kline plays a middle-aged Western Civilizations teacher, the Greeks, the Romans, Caesars, and all of the Emperor's of Rome, Willam Hundert. Let me tell you, Mr. Hundert is the kind of teacher that everyone wants to have for Western Civilizations. It's just a story about a boy's school, and it's a guy movie, go see it now!

      We're gonna make it after all...right?  I don't know what to GRIPE about toay. Gosh, it's thanksgiving, I should be thankful for things. So here is my list, sorry if you didn't make the cut.   1. Family  2. My closest friends! 3. Casey!  4. My "other" friends (heh, just kidding) 5. My god-given talents. 6. Being able to be close to God. 7. Being able to be educated. 8. Having money to buy things I need and want.  9. Having people that care a lot about me.  10. having a healthly life.  11. Having people that support me in everything I do.  Well, I think that just about covers it all, you know? I've better get to studying, I've got to do well on this test thing that Coach Waters is giving, I must get an A in his class. Also, I have to start to prepare for my debate I have to give on Tuesday, I think.  Anyway. No extras today! I'm getting sleepy....

      Car trips are boring, and so are boys under 18.  Well, we have our first GRIPE. Which I whole-heartly agree with.  Jessie, my devoted fan (No...really...she is.) "Yeah music!" - Jessie.  I am sure she meant me.  Make a gripe about people who are like "I LOVE YOU! MUAH MUAH!" to their   boyfriends/girlfriends/goats/etc after like a day.  Mer.   xxx   Oh goodies. An amazing GREAT GRIPE. Congrats Jessie. We love you. Here goes.   Have you ever been walking down the hallways at school, enjoying YOUR school day (Does that happen?) when you see a couple making out...in the corner....of the hall? Tounges obviously whipping out everywhere. Does this not make you ill? It sick and gross. If you want to make out, go do it in the comfort of your own home, not in a public viewing area. Okay. Kiss. No tounges. No touching. And don't be all like "AWWW!! I love you baby!!!" Because you know what, I don't feel like seeing your friggin' PDA all the friggin' time. Go into the bathroom, for the love of God! My virgin eyes, Gosh, seriously. Don't do it in front of me, and if you do, next time, I will rip our lips off. Violently. With a chainsaw. I seriously, seriously hate it when people are making out. And i'm not a boyfriendless person either. When was the last time I was all up on Casey and making out? Never. Because it's not....it's not nice. Try me with kindness. I don't like your tounge, or your make-out partner's tounge. KEEP IT IN YOUR MOUTH. GET IT OUT OF MY FACE!! Tounges don't like company, not in public. THEY ARE NOT SOCIAL BEINGS.  They aren't Fraggle's for God's sake. They don't live and mine in a cave and seek help from a friggin' talking trash heap. They like to be alone, in public. When they're in your home, let them go wild, lick all you want. Just not in front of me. Never in front of me. I HATE IT! Do it in front of me and see what happens.  Just like...don't have sex within my bubble. That's right people. And my bubble is the whole room. That's right. Mine.

      Sugar-free, minus the coating.  I have faithful viewers! This shocks me, yet isn't the first time I've noticed that people care and read my mindless stuff. Wait, no, it's not mindless. I think I but more into this than my...artwork. Mabye I should do this as a profession. How awesome would that be? Anyway. Since I have faithful viewers, if you have a GRIPE please, let me know, and i will rant all I can about it. Anything. Even if it's about me. I'm running out of GRIPEs. Well, not really. Alarm clocks are the most infernal machines that man could ever make. Mine doesn't even wake me up properly. I hit it a few times and then fall back asleep.   Like this morning.   My alarm clock goes off at...5:00 A.M. And my T.V. turns on Cartoon Network, and Time Squad is on. Well, it's the episode with Napoleon...and he's like running with a sword or something and I just stand there in my boxers and t-shirt and laugh while shivering saying "Stupid French man...world domantion is for The Romans." And crawl back into bed slowly and start my day off horribly. But that was just so great...with the Napoleon...and...okay, I'll shut up.   Anyway...on the other side of this. Tomorrow is the last day of the school week! Which rocks out loud. But I have to charge up my phone because I'm going to stay after to talk to Stupid Coach Waters about my friggin' grade. I'm not letting him bring me down, I worked my ass off, no way he is bring me down. Gr. I have angry problems. The semester is almost over, and I am SO leaving that class with a 90. I'll beat him into submission if I have to. That's right. Beat. Violently. With a Chainsaw. I need to get off this GRIPE.  New GRIPE!  I got nothing. Gosh darn it. I'm just so happy all the time. Folks, this isn't my fault, Casey just makes me so darn happy, he sucked all my angst out of me. Unless you want to hear me rant about boobs. OH! I don't think you want to. Good, because I'm not don't want to rant about it. Little sisters, maybe? No. I'll rant about next semster. Next semster will rock hard, because, I get to be in Drama and Music tech. Hehe. Math and Science. ^-^ Hopefully, I'll be stuck with Anna is 2 out of 4 of my classes like this term. Rock.   Anywho....here goes the last part.   Song(s) of the moment: I have two today. -[Hands Down]- Dashboard Confessional and -[(I hate) Everything about you]- Three Days Grace  GRIPE: the bus. I've got a story about that...for another time. Other GRIPE: Not having enough GRIPEs to rant about. Seriously. If you have one IM me. Don't be scared. I don't bite. Hard. Nah. Seriously, if you read, IM me, I'd like to hear what you think!

      Hello Hades. Don't mind the orange spary paint on my mind.   A letter to Coach Waters.   Dear Mister Waters,  I am one of your students, Stephanie Hutson, of your third block Honors World History class. Here is what I think of you.  You are a tryannical man, with no compassion towards anyone that walks into your classroom. You have conformed your mind you personal ideals that you think everyone should follow. You over-load out stressed minds with excessive work, only to give us extreme toil the next day when you take 15 points off after you claim to be unable to read our writing. You say that students have never had a problem with you, well obviously you haven't met me. I am sick of your arguements that you are always right. You play God with our grades and that fact is that you are not. No longer will I stand for this satanic dictatorship in the classroom. We are not minds to be molded into your conformed and insane ways. I'm feed up with you feeding me bull shit about how having a time limit is good, even though the group is obviously missing one person that was unable to be replaced. And yet, that is somehow my fault that I am unable to furfill this because I've had plenty of time, yet, any of the required information left out would have lost me points anyway. You have to blame everything on someone else, it is never your mistake, always ours. Read this, and take heed. I am protesting your methods. I will stand against you, like many low-life peasents stood against a corrput leader. I have supporters, and I have freedom. I am a powerful force, and I will do everything that I can to stop you. Nonvoilent methods are the way, so are the teachings of Gandhi. With all that you have taught us, and all that you have forgetten, let me tell you this. History is made by people that take a stand, so sit up and watch us try, we are the future, you are nothing more than a fading image of the past, and the past is curshed. History repeats, and so it shall be with us. Deny us food, and we will take it. Deny us freedom, and we will steal it. Deny us water, and we will still drink it. Deny us our feelings, and we will show them. And deny us our speech, and we will speak louder than before. So there, Mister Waters, now you must deal with what you have created. You've molded our minds revolution. But like all the leaders before you, are you prepared to fall?  Sinceraly, Stephanie Hutson

      Hello Houston.  "You say If you were to wait Something just might change I say That i don't have the strength  to burn our fueling Flame."  -The Starting Line.  That was the first song that popped up on my Random. It says in the song that Love can make you stay. Somehow, I have gained belief for this. I.E., Casey. For those of you that know the story, doesn't it make sense? It does to me. I figured out..That I have a new favorite song, by my new favorite band (I have a new one each week). First off, It's either "Kissing you goodnight" or "On my mind" by Alister. Which is a band that rocks. But it's great song. I also like "Somewhere Down in Fullerton." Which is a great song by the same band. Anyway. I decided that my favorite movie was Ever After today. I like Princess Movies. Like The Princess Bride, which is such a GREAT movie. It's got the guy from Robin Hood: Men in Tights in it, as Wesley. Gosh I could go on for hours about that movies...those movies. I could aslo go on for hours about Homestar Runner and the enviroment. I'm such a Marizpan! Any...way...  Song of the moment: Seriously? -[The Sorry Song]- The Troys.  GRIPE: The name of that BAND!  Other gripe: COCAH WATERS!!   MUAH!! KC is my baby!!!

      Ring goes on, Rings goes off.  Oh, first off. Good luck to Jessie and the Closer! Do great at your show!!  Yay. I'm super-excited and I'm having a super great day! Tomorrow I'm going to dinner with KC, which just like, brings me such happiness. I'm also shocked and amazed that you know, my parents are letting me. Very, extremely, shocked. KC is my sweetie, and like just the greatest guy ever.  And I'm super glad I'm his girl. Super is just my favorite word now. But yes, my parents are letting me venture out into the world if adulthood. Isn't it scary? No, not at all, infact I feel ready. Very ready. And Very excited. Did I mention I was excited? Arg. It's 9, and I'm so about to fall asleep. This is like THE shortest entry I've ever written, but I do have business to take care of. Tomorrow I have a date with KC, right now I have a date with a vaccum cleaner.

      Flavor of the week.    As for life, we see a lot of these, well, i see a lot of them. Short term relationships. It's the way to go if you ask me, unless, you decide to get attached. Attachment is something that no human being should do without consulting the person they've become attached to. Attachment is just like love, a grave mental condition that half of the teenagers in my high school suffer from. Which is the extact reason I've totally given up on love altogether. Finding your soulmate could take years, finding your lifemate could take decades, which I don't have time for. I refuse to go out looking for love now, because I'm totally convinced I can't find it out there. Love is just a stupid thing in my mind. You have someone else to support you, but aren't friends for that? So, you have sex. Get a condom and a friend without a STD and have a ball. Get birth contorl for God's sake. Love is just a painful and pitiful emotion. If you love someone, don't draw a heart around there name and yours, draw a circle, because a circle can never be broke, but a heart can be.     Well, bit of the winter break. i have nothing else to do but Run later, or just sleep. Which sleeping is sounding better and better to me right about now. Well, besides those things, I'm starting to write my book in my free time these few weeks that I have off from school now. Being in high school is a sucky thing, like, when you're in Advanced Acting. If you ask me, too cut-throat. But hell, they got themsleves into a hell of a lot of pain with me, they want the role, too damn bad, I've learned not to crumble, say all they want, They'll eat there words. When I'm famous...one way or another, I'll get there. Newspaper, books, movie director. See you there, this is just High school, deal with my insight, bitches.  But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long. To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up. Damn straight.     www.thecloser.org   Go read my review of their Decemeber 19th X-mas Show.     Did I mention how bad-ass RoTK is? Well. It's the most bad-ass. Of course, as my Father and friend Jason said, it was a little homosexual, but who cares!! They're hobbits! Everyone loves Hobbits! I love Hobbits! I even named my new laptop Pippin! I'm naming one of my kids Peregrin! So!! Put that in your pipe and smoke. If anyone wants to go see RoTK again...I'm up for it!!    GRIPE- [It's not X-mas yet]- MUSIC -[Aerodynamic]- and -[Something about Us]-  Daft Punk.  Sorry I like Techno too. (Even though Something About Us sounds like Kinky Prono music....)  "It might not be the right time I might not be the right one But there's something about us,  that I want to say because there's something between us anyway. I might not be  The right one It might not be  The Right time. But there's something about us, I've got to do Some kinda secert I will share with you. I need you more than anything in my life. I want you more than anything in my life. I'll miss you more than anyone in my life. I love you more than anyone in my life."   -[Something About Us]- Daft Punk

      Cue the angst.  Angst, ah, angst. A feeling felt by most teenagers. How painful, eh? Angst is something that you have, even if you claim to be emotionless. Angst, a factor in the daily lives of us all. So, why is it that angst affects some of us more than other? Is it in our genes to be more angst than others? Or is it simply disappiontment, and a more dramatic life that people with more angst live? Is it a bad omen, or terrible karma that some how we got from our younger years? All those years of bullying others come back to you? Or maybe you weren't the bully, just the one being bullied, and are conveniced that one day, you'll have wonderful karma and get just what you want out of life, but as for now, cue the angst.  Some of us have to deal with it on a daily basis, and some of us don't, but it doesn't matter if you have that feelings, because, at some point of the day, you're around someone that is angsty. Naturally, you'll have some too, sooner or later. Face it, being happy isn't something you can do all the time, so you might as well give it up. Hiding angst is even worse, the more you hide it, the more you get. You start to develop a collection of angst, you'll you have a high-stress breakdown, and trust me, those aren't too pretty. Being a angst person myself, I can tell you this: Release your angst, openly if you must. First off, it's good for you, and second of all, it adds drama to any normal high school life. Angst + fantasy + lies + truth + betrayal = great great drama and a lovely angsty high school life.   Ciao, Steph  Song of the moment: Pretty Girl (This way) -[Sugarcult]-

      Led on to keep the feelings srong And make me still believe Our Page, is one in the same Our ways will spearate tonight.  I've got a lot going on lately, and it really hasn't been a cup of tea. Finals, Drama, Waters, etc., just plain old too much stuff to deal with. So the blog has been sort of dead. Sorry guys. I've got nothing interesting to say anymore (how sad). Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I think of stuff to write.   See you, Steph

      What do you want? A lung?    Sooo. I know I said I'd update daily but...since Friday has been rather hades-ish around the household of me. If you haven't noticed I've been in an unusally bad mood these two days. Sorry for that. Christmas cheer came too early this year (just like a day. Long story...it has a toliet in it. Figure it out.) Anyhow, i've got nothing to GRIPE about, and Arg. That's about it. Seriously, besides the forever nagging of Waters, everything this all happy in my world. Even though I need the vocab list from L.A. class, whoops, my bad, forgot to copy it. Not too much homework, although, I can tell you that I will be up again late slaving over a hot essay for Waters' class again. I don't think he knows what "I have other classes" means. All I know is I'm tired and stuff. I've got drawings to do, homework to write, Stuff like that, you know? It's hard to get this in, because most of the time, I'm at Casey's house, or out with Casey after school. He's just wonderful for drving me every place possible. I'm going to nap, I might post again later. See you!

      Happy New Year...and all that Jazz.  Hey everyone. It looks likke I'm alive and kicking once again, mostly to ring in the New Year. Of course,  it was about ten seconds of fun. And then Anna and I kissed. Ha. And everyone but Jared missed it. Haha. You poor saps. Then of course the three of us looked at each other and all said "So, back to Melee." In which Anna proceeded to kick my ass at. Then, like the manics we are, we went outside and laid on the FREEZING cold driveway. Man, sometimes just being with your friends kick some major ass. Not even a huge group, or anything. Friends have obviously been the best part of '03, as has the news, and CC, all the way. And what's to look foreward to in '04? My senior friends garduating, Acting in the play, CC, Art Camp, and maybe a bit more writing, and but of course, driving and turning 16. March 21st. Don't forget it. Hopefully, I'll win an Oscar on my birthday, maybe. Hah. Don't laugh, because one day I'll be famous.  -[Steph]-

       Legend of Zelda...away!   So...I pitched a fit in Music tech today because...I suck at it terribly....Terribly....It wasn't even like on purpose, I was like...ugh. I didn't, however have to play it until tomorrow, which requires me to RUN vigorously from C01 to A15 in order to finish my piece of shit Zelda Techno song which is just HORRID. I'd be better off playing something totally different, I'm just not musicallt talented, however, being a drama queen has it's advantages, such as drivng Mr. Jean to say "enough drama, we'll do this tomorrow." thank you God, thank you God!! Anyway, our drama peeps got back from conference on Sunday, and we (those of us that did not go) did get to hear about it. I was amazed by Colby Lemaster, as I always am, seeing as in my eyes, he is just remarkable. He is a juinor, and out of all the the...uh....7 people that auditioned for Sholarships Colby got 9 call backs from 9 different colleges. Truly, he is amazing, remember that name, he's not just a high school star, he'll be big, or at least, I'm hoping he makes it big, he deserves it, he's amazing. And he told me I was talented, so I nearly pissed my pants that day, even though I sounded pretty stupid, I was happy he said something, anyway, today was a new day in which I was grounded...for..ummm...a week. But that so matters not, I didn't go to school today... I'm uh....sick if you will,sick to my stomach, I was sobbing, and ugh, PMS took over....and I just died....not really...just went to sleep. Mental and Emotional breakdown really...just...ugh, had one. I am feeling so much better now though, after eating my weight in necco wafers. I just hope to hit school tomorrow, enough to be off book at rehersal....UGHH!! I HATE EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWNS! Insanity....INSANITY! I'm going crazy.....and...i just broke...down....   Ciao....

       Defying Gravity.   I have a a bit of a lament.   Why is it that the blogger main page only shows blogs such as  urlLink Help Me, Bubby! , frankly Bubby, there is nothing wrong with your 80 year-old self giving out advice, but us Drama Queens do mind not being presented on the front page....I mean, I'm a High School Aspiring Director Drama Queen Artist. what am I going to complain to Bubby about that I don't complain to Dr. Abby or  urlLink Strong Bad .  Then again, there are a few good ones, such as  urlLink Spam Poerty  and of course, the very awesome and totally worth a look  urlLink Bam Diary , which is about memebers of the AMAR Fondation. Which only makes me wonder when I look at the other...uh...five or so of them, and they all end up being about the Presidental Election, which, me being a High School Aspiring Director Drama Queen Artist, I do not care as long as my parents are happy. Of course, you then click on the quick blogs, ones that have been recently up dated to find totally and utter crap such as  urlLink Kelly Osborne online  No one like you Kelly, you SUCK. No one wants to hear about how much everyone loves Kelly Osborne, because I hate her, and she dresses like a foo'. That's right, Kelly Osborne is A FOO'! Not Fool. A Foo'. Then you have the normal lamenting from College Students, such as my sister, or my friend Mike.  urlLink Oh look! Another Soapbox! , which I am not going to say is terribly bad, for this is nothing but a soapbox of a tastefuly drama queen who has a little too much time on her hands, becasue I go around clicking on links on the front page of blogger and retort my feelings to you on how badly this certian blog,  urlLink see link here , is. And of course, that blog does not suck.   Of course, then you have weonderful blogs in different lanuages, and of course, not to insult or anything, but it's just so amazing that there are blogs in  urlLink Arabic!  I think it's freakin' awesome. I don't even know what it says, but it's freakin' Arabic! How in the hell does that happen? I mean, I'm just curious. Then, you have blogs with warnings at the beginning warning people like rides warn people...you know...the nursing or pregnant thing...yeah....you know, such as  urlLink  SCHiTZoMANIa . Then you have blogs like  urlLink  Punk Rock Princess  which...are...common...misconspections. I mean, there you go, there is my lament on blogs, and you can stick that in your pipe and smoke it.  Anyway, it obvious that I have devoted this bog to drama and everything about it, because of Mr.Devlin and everything that he's done...such an impact he's had aleady....wannna be assiant director!!! Ah well...'tis life.Anyway....anothe lament tomorrow..  Caio!

       Age Ain't Nothing But A Number, baby.      If that statement is true, then why does it matter at such a young age? I'm 16...and I love someone that's 20. He's 20, as in four years older than me, as in, when I finish High School, He'll be finished with College, able to get a job and support himself and a family. And so it is looked on down the whole freaking world now? When I'm 18 and he's 22, it won't matter anymore, oddly enough because by law, now I'm an adult. So what? Why does it have to count now? He's not going to do anything to hurt me. Hell, he can't even buy liquor. And when he can? Does America thing he's really going to shove a shot glass down my throat unless I WANT him to? It's just so furstrating that everyone see it as a taboo, even my FATHER. Well, my father sees everything as a taboo, and it's not like a blame him, because I love him to death. My mother doesn't mind as much, and his parents don't mind as much, saying "Well, as long as you don't have sex with her." What's the problem in if he does have sex with me? It would be consensual, he'd never force me into anything. So, techincally, the statuatory rape charge is so that parents and get their daughter's boyfriend's thrown into jail because they love them=. And yes, America, maybe I am too young to know the meaning of love, but I have this unexplainable feeling for him, it's nothing like it was with any of my other beaus, it isn't purely sexual either, hell, it's hardly sexually. It being, knowing that he is always being, and thinking about you in the back of his mind, that he knows that he's yours and your his. It's...it's that he'd fly 2000 miles just to get to take you to dinner for one night, and to meet your parents. That's like 280 bucks he's willing to spend to SEE me. God, it's unexplainable, and maybe he's not my true love, but what's saying that I can't find someone that I "love" at 16? Nothing. Not my parents, and not God, and Most Certainly NOT America.    It's the feeling that his very being makes you happy...just him being.      GRIPE OF THE DAY/WEEK: Read "Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,baby"?  Music: "Cold Hard Bitch" - Jet, "Old College Avenue" - Harry Chapin, and "Get Low (feat. Ying Yang Twins)" - Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz

      No one mourns the Wicked.    "Glinda: I've heard it said, that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing sometime we must learn and we are lead to those who help us must to grow if we let them, and we help them in return. Well I don't know if I believe that's true, but I know I'm who I am todaqy, because I knew you. Like a comet pulled from orbit, as it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder,m halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better, but because I knew you, I have been changed for good.  Elphaba: It well maybe that we may never meet again, in this lifetime, so let me say before we part, so much of me is made of what I learned from you. You'll be with me, like a handprint on my heart. And now whatever way our stories end, you rewritten mine, by being my friend. Like ship blown from its moring by a winbd off the sea. Like a sege rocked by a sky bird in a distant wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better, but because I knew you.  Glinda: Because I knew you  Elphaba and Glinda:I have been changed for good.  Elphaba: And just to clear the air, I ask forgiveness, for the things I've done, you blamed me for.  Glinda: But then, I guess, there's blame to share   Glinda and Elphaba: And none of it seems to matter anymore.  Glinda(Elphaba): Like a comet pulled from orbit, as it passes a sun.(Like ship blown from its moring by a winbd off the sea.) Like a stream that meets a blouder,m halfway through the wood.(Like a sege rocked by a sky bird in a distant wood.)   Elphaba and Glinda:Who can say if I've been changed for the better, but because I knew you, I have been changed for good. I do believe I have been changed for the better  Glinda:And because I knew you  Elphaba: Because I knew you  Glinda and Elphaba:Because I knew you, I have been changed...For Good."  For Good, Wicked The Musical.  Let me give you a little idea of what Wicked is about, in case you don't know. Elphaba, is our wicked witch of the west. Glinda, that;s right, Glinda the good witch. They were friends, at Shiz universty. This is the very last song as Elphie is dying. Maybe that will show you that the evil one is secertly the good? All men have a seed of evil within them, women just have theirs in bloom.  So evil is in all mankind, and what about good? Fortuneatly, above all things, I belive in the good in people, and I try to look past the evil. However, I don't believe that there is good in all people, maybe at one point, yes, but after a certain point, evil takes over. It starts simply, and there is no one pure and innocent being in this world. All have been subjected to this harted that what planted deep within all men as a fatal flaw by God. Its what spereates us from God. Our Humanity.   So, our humanity makes us think we're better than others, and throws us to the lions, and shows haterd towards each other. So, I have something to say to all of you that have decided that haterd towards me is better than anything else. Making it, seemingly in your eyes, hard to live in this harsh high school life. Where being my friend is dangerous, rebellious! Are we not pawns in this novel of our lives? Is the main character not always an outcast? Well, I'd rather be the main character than some cowardace that makes idle threats and deadly comments behind someones back. So here, to you lot of flithy and loathesome creatures:   Thank you  Thank you  Thank you.     As I like to say, what doesn't kill me, only makes me stronger. I have two years left of idle threats and deadly comments, do you think with the slightest notion of hate towards me, I would wither and die? Oh no. I am Stephanie Leigh Hutson, and you may scorn me constantly and hiss rudely with your forked tounges as I pass, but one day, it will all come back to you. And no, I do not seek revenge upon you for being so, go on, be this way if it brings you joy. I'm glad to oblige. But be fearful, you sliver-tounged snakes, for one day, I will hold the upper hand. And don't worry, I am not one to hold grudges.

      So much for my happy ending.    Wait. I have one.   So, it occured to me lately that just becauase my life has not been picture of perfection for the past two years of high school, or at least my romantic life, which, by the way, has been a flaming hell hole of bad relationships and carbon copies of "The one", which I had thought, until most recently, I had yet to find. But, is life and relationships nothing but seeing carbon copies of the one that we are meant to be with? And what if we think we have found that one, and through a terribly tragic accident, the one, dies. So, how are we suppose to carry on with our lives? I have heared that if love is strong enough...that possibly you will join your love soon in the heavens, but sometimes that's really not the plan, is it? So, say "the one" dies, a tragic car accident, and you didn't. You are now a single parent with...two children to raise, a new born baby that was not in the car and a three year old that was also not in the car. What are you, the single parent to do? How do you live without the one that you've loved for years? Frankly, I'm not to sure what I'd do. But rea;lly, do I need to worry about that?   So anyway....  I'm headed off to camp in Savannah at the college of Art and Design there. I'm a bit scared. I've been marveled as the best for a while at my non-artistic school...and now? Going to an art college will be hard for me. Accepting the fact that I'm not held in high esteem is very hard for me, especially when I'm taking life-drawing...with is not a good subject for me at all. Join me later this week as we finish going through the trials and tribulations of a young artist....   Such Bullshit sometimes.    Songs of the moment: "Let's get it started" - The Black Eyed Peas   "My Happy Ending" - Avril, whatever song that Robot on Robot Violence played at their last show, and "Mexican Wine" - Fountains of Wayne.   Gripe: the age thing. Still, my parents are so...odd sometimes.   And no matter what, I still love him.

      Adventures in driving and love.  Yes, all it is true, one day you will be on the road with me. I drive, yes, it is true. Driving is fun. Other Drivers are not fun.  Shot conceration. Insanity. Driving stresses one out a bit. I'm not going to be "offically" driving until Oct., but that doesn't really matter much. The point is, I am driving. You know, there are a bunch of assholes on the road nowadays. It's just a bunch of insanity and people drive like freaking psychopaths sometimes. I just get a wee bit stressed out, sometimes, at least. I can back into a space...but parrell parking is..hellish. Speaking of Hellish...I hate summers in Georgia. I don' t think it's ever been hotter here and I'm like freaking sweating and it's nasty as hell. Ugh, can't it like rain or snow...or stop being summer before school starts? Speaking of school, it starts on the 9th...what a terribly hellish existance I have.  Love. I love being in love. Love, is by far the best thing in the world. I have a worderful guy, and he's just what I say, wonderful. I get all pissy during my...you know...and I just don't ever want to screw up like I did last night. I said "The M Word"..."married/marriage"...of course, in the fact that I totally screwed up a sentence made me go into utter panic an  my rambling gene kicked me in the ass. I dunno. Right now, he's in Arizona, and I'm here, risiding unhappily in the heat. At least he's dealing with the same heat. What a world.   Today, when I was driving, I saw a sparrow burtally murder and eat a butterfly. Oh...The Carnage!  GRIPE of the day: 8 days until school. Do I need another reason to be all gripe-y? MUSIC: Hm...Which three songs...?  "My Stupid Mouth" - John Mayer, "Makes No Difference" -Sum 41....Gah...I dunno...
