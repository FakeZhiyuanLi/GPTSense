      Ever just wake up, but you still can't WAKE UP? I've been up and about for 3 hours now. Got up, took a shower, got dressed, dragged my laundry to the car, drove to work, ate breakfast, sent a few emails, and I'm still not awake! Its like my brain is still asleep.  I don't like this feeling.  I feel even more like crap because I was up till 1 am bawling my eyes out. I'm having problems with a guy friend of mine (well, we're a little more than friends). He's driving me crazy to the point that I just want to never talk to him again. He's putting me through too much pain!   I don't want to over-dramatize things, however. I think my lunacy might be due to a combination of stress and hormones. Whatever it is, it sucks.  I'm sure everyone in my life thinks I'm crazy now.  I started these birth control pills and my hormones are just wacky! I'm crying, I'm tired, my boobs hurt. This really sucks.  When will it end?!

      Why is that?  It seems to me that most men possess the capability of being a complete sweetheart but they fight it tooth and nail. They feel like they have to be asshole suprimo to be liked.  Let me just tell you guys, it DOESN'T WORK!   For me, my heart melts when a man treats me well. That means he calls me when he says he's going to. That means he doesn't make me chase him.  That means he admires me and thinks about me all the time.  Now I'm not they type of girl that needs material things (I prefer to buy for myself). All I ask for is a man who's heart is in it just as much as mine.  What I keep getting are men who have serious, I mean, SERIOUS issues. Commitment-phobic, emotionally-unavailable, and just plain WEIRD guys!  Why do I even bother anymore? What makes us waste even a moment of time on these losers? Is it because there are just so many of them, that if we didn't keep them, we'd be single forever?

      What really is depression? Whenever I think of it, I think of someone who sits in a dark room and cries all the time contemplating doing BAD BAD things to themselves.  When you're officially depressed, you can't function, am I right?  Or is depression broader than that? Can you be clinically depressed and still be functional?  If so, then I think I might be.  You see...I've been through a lot of crap in the last 10 months of my life. I'm at a point I'd thought I'd never be and it's becoming really scary.   I know I'm strong enough to get through it, but I wonder how long it will last. Will my fears and emotions end up crushing my psyche?  When does someone get to the point that they seek professional help?

      Hello and Welcome! I came across this kick ass blogger site and thought I'd give it a try! I guess this will be my diary of sorts. I'll share my "issues" with you and get your input!

      Ok, so I got to take a little vacay over the holiday weekend. Spent some time with my little sissies (they're all growed up now!) LOL  Spending time with my family was definitely therapeutic for me. I highly recommend spending some time with your family if you feel down in the dumps. It works wonders.  So my hormones seem to have leveled out some. No more sore boobs, and I'm not a total emotional wreck. We'll see how the next week goes.  Oh yeah, and that guy "friend" of mine. Still a jerk. Stood me up last night! Spent 3 hours cleaning my house, finally getting my clean laundry out of the car, giving myself a pedicure, and taking a very nice shower. But hey, at least I got my house clean!   But get this! I decided to go to bed, right? So I was almost asleep when he finally calls at about 11:00. I answered the phone in a very annoyed tone. He said, "Hey, what's up?" and I said "nuthin." He then started saying "Hello? Hello?" like his phone was cutting out. Then, *boom*, end of call. So I called back. and I called, and called, and left a message.  No call returned.   So I gave it a breather. However, now I'm wide awake, and very hungry (since I didn't eat dinner). I decided to order dinner. Shortly after, I called him again, only to find out that he was on the phone!  GASP! What! You know that little beep that attaches itself to the end of a ring when you call someone and they're on the other line. Yup.  Needless to say, he didn't click over. And 12 hours later (now) he still hasn't called.  Why do I even bother?  My retaliation strategy: I won't be answering his calls this week. I just hope I can be strong enough to do it.
