      Well, this will be the last post for about a week. I'm going to Cuba incase you hadn't heard me try to bring it up into every conversation ever. Ummm... I might be able to bring back some souvineers for some of you, but chances are I wont be able to bring back anything non print. I am nervous. Very much so. I will post all about it on Thursday when I will have typed up my journal.

      Well today was filled with fun. I woke up, showered, and then went to Target to buy travel supplies with my mom. I think that I am prepared to go to the depths of Africa now, so Cuba should be a breeze. So, we parted ways. I was bored, so I decided that I was going to go to Dunkin Donuts and get my daily coffee fix, and then go to a couple of bookstores. 2 dollars later I am at the Barnes and Noble in Cary.  "Walter? Walter!" Kristen Jarmen exclaimed. Lo and behold Tyler and Kristen are standing there looking for Kristen's summer reading due on Monday.&nbsp; So after they thuroughly examine the two geeky magazines that I was buying I invite them to come with me to see a movie at Mission Valley. I get in free there because I work at the Garner Towne Square Regal Entertainment Cinema.  SO, I say,"Tyler, follow me!" Next light I lose him. I have this tendency to still go through the light on a yellow if I have enough time. So, (While constantly scanning the horizon behind me for a red station wagon) I get to Mission Valley and RUN back up Avent Ferry road to make sure that I hook up with Tyler and Kristen if they found their way. About a minute after I parked they drove up and I waved them into the parking lot of the place with Baha Burrito (Mental Note: Are they the ones who provide our school's burritos?) so I wouldn't have to walk back to the lower parking lot. We decide to briefly step into a student store named Addams. I find a Kill Bill vol. 2 poster there which I vowed to buy after the movie. Of course the obscure Physics book about some missing cat isn't there so we decide to trot down to the Cup-a-Joes for a quick lunch before the movie.  As I was walking down the covered walkway down to the lower area of mission valley I hear, "Walt. Walt!" My mom was calling my name. She seemed rather confused, but I cared not. I said that I was going to a movie and I met up with Tyler and Kristen, and then she decided to go back to her lunch at Baha. Anyways, we go to Cup-a-Joes, me still lugging around my "Great One" coffee from that morning from Dunking Donuts. The "Joe's Club" there is awefully good. Anyways, we watch the 1:10 showing of Borne Supremacy. It was good, if you liked the first then you will like the second.  When I get home I get a rather ANGRY message from my mother demanding to know where I was and wanting to know why I hadn't told her where I was going. But, my name was cleared when she heard that I left a message with my dad. Anyways, in the time that I had been gone my dog Max had raided the supplies for Cuba, and had decided to eat 16 packs (5 piece) of gum. That includes all wrappers, and the cellophane covering from one aswell. Needless to say he has been projectile pooping&nbsp;in streams&nbsp;ever since. He deserves it. ANYWAYS, I head to work, to the Friday night rush dance, stare in awe at this really hot new coworker from California (often times becoming incredibly clumsy only when she was looking, you know, horemones.), try to be chummy with the managers (All 7 of them (out of 9)) there, the usual.&nbsp; At the end of the night I am handed a long cardboard tube. Inside upon reaching home I find 5 POSTERS. These are the movie ones that have white lights behind them and you see everywhere inside the theatres. Guess what I got! 1. Starsky and Hutch 2. Troy (a really hot close up of Brad Pitt) 3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 4. Chronicles of Riddick 5. The Alamo :P  So, if any of you REALLY want one of these, I'll see if I'm not going to use it and you might pay me or prove your a real friend or something. Anyways, toodaloo.

      When I first saw this&nbsp;on Stephen Lumpkin's blog I contemplated putting it on here, but after everone else doing it, I figure I might as well.  1. Who are you? 2. Are we friends? 3. When and how did we meet? 4. Do you have a crush on me? 5. Would you kiss me? 6. Describe me in one word. 7. What was your first impression? 8. Do you still think that way about me now? 9. What reminds you of me? 10. If you could give me anything what would it be? 11. How well do you know me? 12. When's the last time you saw me? 13. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 14. Are you going to put this on your blog and see what I say about you?

      By the way, I did get a 5 on the Gopo AP and a 3 on the Music Theory. The music theory is about what I expected (I got a 4 on the non audio and a 3 on the audio which somehow averages out to 3) and being that it is THE hardest test that I have ever taken, I am pleased with that result. I called Mrs. Newmark to share the good news and she rejoiced with me and then we casually chatted about what movie she should take Mr. Newmark to go see, and I said Spider-Man 2.&nbsp; Anyways, I'm ecstatic, but I have yet to tell my parents. Don't know why, I just don't feel like it. 5!!!!!!! EAT IT!!!!!! DAMN that feels good. 5!!! That's like uber college credit. If I keep at this rate I will be one of those special students that they had names for in the one sheet of paper that came home with the AP grades. 5!!!!! I wasn't sure I could do it, but evidently I did.&nbsp; Wonder how everyone else did. I probably had the lowest 5. NO, I shouldn't be so pessimistic. I WAS PERFECT. NOTHING WRONG. I GOT A FIVE!!!!  Yet I&nbsp; can't help but focus on the bad, but such is my nature. Dick says that for every 9 times I think about something I was unsuccessful at I should think of something that I Was successful at. It's so hard though. Success just goes in and then I shit is right out and I simply don't remember it. It leaves me with nothing but the nasty memories. Darn those nasties.

      I have had so little time to myself recently. The past 5 or 6 days I have been either working, at a wedding, eating, or sleeping. I really need to be getting more ready to go to Cuba, but there's only so much I can do. Apparently some of the Cuba pilgrams had dinner tonight at a Cuban place, but I was busy getting bad service at Carrabba's (or some italian place like that). Anyways, I'm taking tons of stuff to Cuba for other people, but I can't help but feel like a pack mule because I'm not really taking everything that I want to. I'm selfish, I know. I can't believe that Payday is still a week away.

      Well, I am back from quite possibly the best wedding that I have ever been to. My cousin Clare was married on Saturday in South Carolina to this cool guy named Travis. It was great fun getting to see my family more often than once a year. So far we have had two non usual gatherings on my dad's side of the family, my grandparent's golden anniversary, and this wedding. I got to dress up. It was fun.&nbsp;  Last night I&nbsp;went to Kristen's suprise birthday party that was masterfully planned by Madeline and Tyler. It was bubble themed, meaning that by the end all of the floors outside were covered with suds. May no creature ever again play ice cream cake football. I am going to be going to work in about a hour and a half, and after work I will be jetting off to Andrew's house for something geeky probably, but I am a power geek, so what do I care?

      Well, tonight I had Tuesday night dinner despite the fact that it is Thursday night. Lemme 'slpain. Almost every Tuesday night since Hurricane Fran, my family has had dinner with two men, John and Steve,&nbsp;who went and still go to our church. It originated as us being friends and our power went out during Fran and the five days after so John and Steve brought over food one Tuesday night and we had a very&nbsp; good meal.&nbsp; We decided that we had so much fun that we wanted to go ahead and have dinner the next Tuesday night as well. And so it went for the last 8 years. Pretty crazy eh? Same people, same night, supremely good food? John and Steve have become family to us, and we to them. They are on all of my emergency contacts, and they have often taken care of either me or my little brother when my parents could be with us, typically for work. Well tonight since we couldn't get together on Tuesday we had Tuesday night dinner. John has been to Cuba 5 or 6 times so he helped me plan on what I needed to do to deal with the new 44 lbs. limit. We had chicken and rice. It was a good night.

      Well, I just got back from the Notebook with Bernadette and Melissa (both of whom go to Gibbons), which I must say has recieved undue criticism. While it was not my favorite movie, and I could see through the plot, it certainly excelled at being a chick flick. It would have made me cry had I not seen what was coming from a mile away. But, plot twists have never been a forte of such Chick Flicks. Anyways, if you wanna go to a touching and romantic movie, go to the Notebook, it ain't half as bad as Bethany makes it sound.  I must admit, seeing the movie did rub me raw emotionally in a couple of places. It really did play of what I talked about earlier about the lack of a companion and partner. It didn't help that I sat next to two giggling, burping, and very attractive girls during the movie, just making such things seem that much farther away. Not to mention I have received two bad messages today.  1. I can't take back anything from Cuba when I go, and my COMBINED baggage cannot exceed 44 lbs. Just to let you know, my shit weighs that much. That is NOT enough for international travel.   2. Somebody I expected to be leaving has apparently not left leaving me at a dilemma. I can only wait for this one.  I wish I had balls to tell them what I really think, but I certainly am a gutless coward who couldn't even if I were paid to. To many times have such ventures ended in pain. But I can't help but watch in agony as I go on with life pertending nothing is there. There is no plant that yearns for water as much as I yearn for this girl. God dammit.   Anyways, I am going to go to my cousin's wedding this weekend in South Kakalaki. I don't really know what to expect, mainly because I don't really know this side of the family that well. Weddings, bah humbug.

      Well, what would I be without a good old liberal rant. I am currently being bombarded with Kerry bashing ads, talking either about Kerry's "indecisiveness" about military issues or talking about his "record" of eating babies and hating old people. Such blatant misleading is a patent of the Bush Cheney ticket. In case anybody hasn't seen Farenheit 9/11 let me explain. No there is too much, lemme sum up. Bush got into office because his cousin in the Fox newsroom threw the election to him too early, and his brother tried to hinder any attempt to include everyones vote, and then the decision of who won and lot rested in the hands of a republican Supreme Court. I'm not BITTER or anything. WOOT KERRY AD IS ON. Anyways, after screwing up his first few months in office Bush went on a month long vacation to his Texas ranch. And he criticizes Kerry and Edwards for being absentee senators. Anyways, he ignores the memo saying "BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO ATTACK IN US", then the one saying, "NO REALLY, WE'RE SERIOUS, BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO ATTACK IN THE US", and the finally,"MR. PRESIDENT, PUT DOWN THE GAME BOY, BIN LADEN IS DETERMINED TO ATTACK IN THE US" And yes, that was taken from SNL. Anyways, after 9/11, Bush took advantage of the fear of citizens of the United States, manipulated the rally 'round the flag effect, and lead us into a misguided knock down, drag out war with the dude that tried to kill his daddy. And this was against all evidence that Iraq did NOT have WMDs. Then he goes around pointing the finger of blame at everyone but himself in a vain attempt to clear his name. It's sad that Kerry has barely even started his media Blitz and he is leading in the polls 51 to 43 according to Newsweek. That is definitly mud in Bushes face. Lets not forget that the son of the avatar of Republicans (Ron Reagan) is going to be speaking at the Democratic convention. Plus that lame ass attempt to kill gay marriage is going to die in the senate and probably won't even get a simple majority. Funny that Bush made that a big part of his early campaign. I can't bring to words how much I hate that idiotic Texan.

      Is anybody else obsessed with Letterman and Conan? I can't stop watching these two wonderful comedians. Screw Leno, these guys are the real deal. If you go to either of their websites ( urlLink Conan ,  urlLink Letterman ) and you can see both their talents and the talents of their writers at work. None of this attempted PC image that the Leno show reaks of, these guys are the shizzit.

      Well, I went to sleep at about 1:30 last night as far as I can recall, and then woke up at 4:30 when my dad told me that I had to go to work in an hour and a half. Doesn't that suck! I lost an entire day because I was sleeping. THAT DOES SUCK. I hate that I have to sleep, it takes up so much valueable time. It really does. Plus I gotta get up at about 8:00 tomorrow just to work for 4 hours. Brings to mind the Bare Naked Ladies song who needs sleep?  Now I lay me down not to sleep I just get tangled in the sheets I swim in sweat three inches deep I just lay back and claim defeat  Chapter read and lesson learned I turned the lights off while she burned So while she's three hundred degrees I throw the sheets off and I freeze  Lids down, I count sheep I count heartbeats The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep I countdown, I look around  Who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it Who needs sleep? tell me what's that for Who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War  My hands are locked up tight in fists My mind is racing, filled with lists of things to do and things I've done Another sleepless night's begun  Lids down, I count sheep I count heartbeats The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep I countdown, I look around  Who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it Who needs sleep? tell me what's that for Who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War  Who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it Who needs sleep? tell me what's that for Who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War  There's so much joy in life, so many pleasures all around But the pleasure of insomnia is one I've never found With all life has to offer, there's so much to be enjoyed But the pleasures of insomnia are ones I can't avoid  Lids down, I count sheep I count heartbeats The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep I countdown, I look around  Hala Hala Hala  Who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it Who needs sleep? tell me what's that for Who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War  [Repeat]  All except for the whole lady next to me thing, but one can only hope.   By the way I just got a killer pay check that will save my ass when it comes to the bills, so I am very releaved right now, despite the whole too much/ too little sleep thing.

      Right now I am currently obsessed with two things, the Fantasy genre and Spider-Man. Yes, I know, I'm a marketer's dream, becoming obsessed with the character after the movie has come out, leading them to get all of my money and me be left with products that will quickly fade from my mind. Anyways, Spider-Man has been getting to me. He is too much like me, or not enough, it's difficult to tell. He has problems with school work getting done, I have problems getting schoolwork done, albiet for different reasons. He is brilliant, I think I'm brilliant, he struggles with money, I struggle with money. It's like just what I am right now except for one thing. The Spider-Man comics have always included Mary Jane, the next door neighboor love interest. She has always been very integral to the plot, as she was with both of the movies so far, and with the comics. She is part of Spider-Man, and he is part of her. They are star crossed lovers, destined to be together. I have a dog. I must admit not having gone out with somebody during the last school year certainly did kill my self confidence, but it isn't so much that I want to be an eligable bachelore, I want to find that soul mate, a confidant, a comforter, someone that I can help and who can help me. I can't healp but feel that insessant tugging in the depths of my soul for something more. I just don't have it. I almost had it once with this girl named Hunter in 8th grade, but that didn't work out. I just have never had the experience of having a wonderful and stable romantic relationship. I have had flings, yes, but nothing that has lasted any significant amount of time. Being all alone during the summer doesn't help matters much either. No consistent interaction with other kids my age, making it so much harder to even guage if I would be interested in any of the people that I know. I know, your probably thinking woe is you, but it does kinda suck to me at least.

      Recently I have been spending lots and lots of money. Due to the fact that I get a paycheck (thats right ladies) I have much more money than the typical allowance allows. I can't healp but feel that I am in over my head in the whole money department. I am still paying off a car repair that cost me over $200, attempting to start maintaining my portion of my insurance ($70 a month), GAS (one arm and leg), plus $200 going towards Cuba. That doesn't leave much spending money, but I sure do act like it does.  Three days ago I bought the Ultimate Spiderman Collection which is a bound fully colored and glossed volume of the first 40 Ultimate Spider-Man comics. The price tag is on the back $49.95, but with the sale at Barnes and Noble for 20% off plus my membership discount of 10% that left me paying about $38.xx after tax. That was only one of the numerous frivoulous expenditures as of late. I have been buying old out of print Dungeons and Dragons books and adventures at $5 a pop, thinking each time that it's only five bucks. I also bought a couple of old (2002) video games totalling to about another $50. Mrs. Newmark's husband's lecture keeps ringing in my head. If I only saved 10% of all my earnings from here on out, I would be a millionare when I'm like fifty or somethin. But that 10% is one precious video game that I will play for about a week and then stop caring about. Willpower is one of my various issues, self control to be more precise. This is how it supposedly happens with drugs you know. At first you just try a cigarette or something, then before you know it your employing 4 year olds to swall heroine to sneak through US customs. Spending and doing drugs are like a snowball effect. Isn't there some sort of shoppoholic disease or something like that?  I doubt I have it, I just think that I need a more concrete paycheck and a lesson on financial planning. How much should I be saving for college or for a new car? Should I start up a seperate savings for my different goals or assign percentages to my actual savings account as to how much goes where? But then that would be taking out of the 10% for retirement which means that I will end up working fast food at the age of 60 to get a paycheck to buy my diabetes pills. Damn life could get depressing. It is just really complicated, really really really complicated.

      Well I have been working a lot recently. Infact I am almost working full time at the Garner Towne Square Regal Entertainment Theatre. I worked today, I worked yesterday, and I'm working tomorrow. That is by no means a conclusive list. Just to give a glimpse of what my schedule looked like last week take a look at this:  Friday (July 2) : 9:00 AM-5:00 PM Saturday: 4:00 PM-11:00 PM Sunday: 6:00PM-11:00PM Monday: 6:00PM-11:00PM Tuesday: Only day off... Wednesday: 8:30AM-12:30PM Thursday: 9:00AM-6:00PM Friday: At Nate's thing Saturday: 6:00PM-11:15PM Today: 9:00PM-6:00PM  There you go, after much brain racking. That is almost full time. Damn that's gonna be a big paycheck. Anyways, working so much certainly is draining. I find my sleep patterns have been completely thrown off, due to having a late shift, and then having an early morning shift the next day. That can reak havok on my mind aswell. I routinly have been finding myself sleeping between 12 and 14 hours a day when work allows. That might just be me being a teen, but I thing the work load has something to do with it. SO anyways, work has been monotonous, not much different going on, except that we are almost out of all of our popular candies (Starburst, M&M Tubes, Peanut Butter M&Ms, etc.) so that means that I will have a much harder job than expected until Thursday when stock comes in. Time for the next post, organization is always a plus.

      After quitting blogging I now find myself missing it. I must admit, the last blog idea with me and Lewis was actually a social idea I wanted to test. Basically I created Lewis as an alter identity, and I wanted to see how closely Lewis could intigrate into the Raleigh Charter social circuit despite his obvious lack of existence. I had everything ready, even made a schedule from information from a real High School's website in Ohio. It fell apart when the fake email address that I created for him would accept the invitation to the blog. I realized that that would be a fatal crack in the plan, and I kinda just dropped it. I am going to go ahead and start a second post about all the stuff that has been going on.
