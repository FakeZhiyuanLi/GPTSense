      Getting back into drawing/cartooning has been pretty fun so far. I haven't really committed to any one thing... really just doodling on my sketchbook whenever I feel the need to. I'm just having fun with it. Maybe I'll pick some things to actually scan, color and post on my site soon. We'll see.  I've been looking at a lot of Dean Yeagle's work. I have to say, I love this guy's art. I met him last month at Comic-Con in San Diego. He had a booth set up and was of course showing off his portfolio. He's got a very cool style. And his subject matter doesn't hurt either ;)  See for yourselves.    I still haven't quite figured out how to display images on here. But I'll get it soon ;) Oh, think I got it. Weeee.  So yea, If you're interested in seeing more of his work, feel free to visit www.cagedbeagle.com or www.bellefree.com  Ok, back to work I go.

      Well hello there. Today you will be reading my take on the Butterfly Sword (1993) starring Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. You may remember Michelle Yeoh from a little film titled Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. So anyways, the movie is basically about these 3...kung fu'ers who are have been assigned a mission by their master to retrieve a letter from an opposing martial arts school that proves that they are planning on muscling out all the schools in order to become THE KUNG FU MASTERS. So their plan is to have one of them infiltrate the enemy school in order to complete their mission. Along the way they encounter several hired goons who will try to get in their way, burn their huts and steal their bean sprouts. The nerve.  But yea, I'm only assuming this is the plot because I actually had no idea what was happening throughout the entire length of the movie. You see, the dvd was only available in cantonese or mandarin with english subtitles. And the translations were so bad they were laughable. In fact, they made the movie more entertaining. Phrases like "LOOK OUT!" were replaced with "TAKE CARE!" Now imagine this: Evil overlord leaps into the air to attack our heroine while her back is turned. Her partner sees this and yells, "TAKE CARE!!!" You get the idea. The film was littered with these. Heh.  But the fight scenes were sweet. Guys getting their limbs chopped off by flying stars then having their limbness torso drop kicked. Sword fights soaring thru the air similar to the ones seen in Crouching Tiger. I have to say tho, the final battle made the whole movie. I dare not spoil it for you. Let's just say it involves a pair of sexy legs, a towel, and a guy's head exploding. :-O  Ok, go rent it :) Hey they even have it on netflix.

      Yea, I can't seem to understand why I am posting here instead of on my website : Maybe I should move this blog over to good ole' tonyespinoza.com.  At least I have more control there.  But anyways, this was a good weekend. Good food, good drinks, good people, good music (except for Pimp Juice), good times. Started Friday off right with a trip to ye ole' Ale House with Maria, Edy, Jess, Miriam and Zuly. Before I get into that, I must speak of the trip -to- the ale house. Edy came to my house first so we could all go in one car, so as soon as he arrived we took off to pick up Jess because Maria wanted to spend a little more time with her sister since that was about the only time she saw her while she was down here. So we get to J's place, she gets in the car, we drive off. Oh, I should mention that she has very fresh-smelling conditioner :P. Not 2 minutes into the drive, Jess starts getting IMs on her phone. Apparently whoever messaged her must have said some pretty hilarious shit because she starts cracking up on her own. She then let out the elusive laughter "snort." Yea, you know the one. So of course, we start laughing at it which only  makes her laugh more and, of course, snort louder and more frequently. So needless to say, the drive to get Maria was entertaining. So we pick her up and we're off to the ale hizouse!  I gotta say, I love the ale house. It's loud, its obnoxious, its rowdy. If it only had a mechanical bull, I would be in heaven. This time it was more fun than usual. There's lots to talk about, but I'll let the pictures do the talking for me.   urlLink http://www.tonyespinoza.com/stuff/alehouse/   On Saturday, Maria and I wanted to go to lunch at this italian restaurant that we really like, but when we got there we learned that apparently it only opens after 6 on weekends :( What a jip. So we ended up driving around a lot and finally settled at Houston's. We had this really good chili there. Then I ordered this chili burger that was real good but I liked what Maria got better. It was some kind of "super salad." I mean, I've never had salad like that. It wasn't a girly salad, it was packed full of so much stuff....delicious stuff. It even had steak cut up and all over it. If Hungry-Man made salads, this is what I would imagine it would look like. Mmmm! Then we rented a couple movies and stayed in for the rest of the day/night. I have to say that Maria's rental choosing privelages have been revoked since she managed to get 2 of the worst movies ever spawned from the fiery depths of Hades. One was "Something's gotta give," starring ol' Jack Nickolson(sp) and Diane Keaton. Talk about your pieces of crap. Ugh. Followed by "13 going on 30." *Gag* I'm picking the movies from now on. Mmmm, kungfu flick nights >=)  Sunday was fairly uneventful. I did manage to eat a full rack of ribs and drink a pitcher of beer at Flannigans. But that's it. X_X  So anyways, I gotta get back to work. :\ Zip it up and zip it out!

      If I had to guess, I would estimate that about 99.99997% of all human beings are a waste of air and space. My farts polute the air less than some of these folks' mere precenses do. I mean, seriously, am I the only one who feels this way? Do you ever interact with people who make you think "oh my god, how do you even survive getting out of bed in the morning?" Sometimes I think that some of the idiocy that I encounter can not occur naturally but must have somehow been  engineered  this way. I see stupid people. They're everywhere. They don't know they're stupid.  I could write pages, books, even encyclopedias on the subject. But I won't.  Hey, on a brighter note, I love Kirin Ichiban. So smooth yet very potent. Two bottles and I'm feelin' fine like cherry wine. Best. Beer. Ever.

       Holy mother of moses! What is with all this spyware being installed on my computer all of a sudden? It's like, I try to go to yahoo to check my mail and BAM! I have some girl's puppies in my face asking me to visit her website for some balls out fun. Not that I mind seeing ta-ta's, but holy shit let me just get to my email. I've installed Adaware, Spybot and even HijackThis. They all find all the shit in my system, get rid of them, but they just come right back. I want my laptop back.      So, I've been on this "internet" thing for a while now. Longer than most people. I was downloading music before mp3's. Back when 28.8 was holy hell fast. Why, I even remember when you could buy stuff over the internet via (stolen) credit card without being tracked. Ah, the glory days for super nerds. But let me get to the point. We all know the internet has some awful things to show. We all have that one link we wish we had not clicked. That email we wished we had not opened. I've seen some awful things. But today I saw the most awful thing ever. I consider myself fairly desensitized to things that a normal person would find 'gross' or 'disturbing,' but even I was caught off guard by this.   I speak of none other than "tub girl." You would have thought I'd have listened to the warnings. The "holy shit this is not work safe, click at your own risk" disclaimers on the message boards. But no. I was curious. I clicked. I regretted. So will you.      If you really are as curious as I was then just google "tub girl" and prepare to have your soul stripped from your mortal shell thru your eyeballs. Hey, we should play a game. We'll call it "who can stare at tub girl the longest." It'll be like a staring contest, but with more crying. Well I've said enough.      Hmmm, it's 12:22 and I'm getting another one of my sugar cravings. This is weird. Every night for the past 2 weeks. When will it end? Ok, I'm gonna go get some juice and maybe a cookie.      This is Tony signing off. See you all tomorrow.

       Ok, so the Ale House has been cancelled by jess this friday due to mosquito bites.  Mosquito. Bites.  Help me, buddy jesus. What is going on?  In other news, Maria is in town to help her mom out cuz of the whole aunt-in-the-hospital situation. So you know what that means...  SUSHI FOR DINNER TONIGHT :-D   Oh, and I got my Xbox (the precious...) back from Edy last night so I can continue on my regular schedule of slicing and dicing evil ninjas and deadly fiends. I  think  Ninja Gaiden 1.1 will be available sometime in the next couple weeks, but I'm not one to double check my info so I may be totally wrong. Edy and I watched my Happy Tree Friends dvd's as well. I don't know what it is about cute cuddly fuzzy animals facing brutal deaths that just tickles my funny bone, but hot damn these videos are hilarious. I recommend it to all.   urlLink  www.happytreefriends.com     Hmm, I believe that's all for now. Back to work I go =

        All I wanted to do was post a comment on Jess' blogger, but then I got caught up in the process and now here I am with my own blogger.  Hallelujah!        Ok, well, more to come in the future :)
