       Went over to Seamus last night for dinner; it was just the 3 of us. Seamus has been doing his house in Collinswood up recently; new wooden floors and all the rooms have been painted. Also he had taken delivery that day of a new Ford Mondeo. After dinner we watched Switchblade(?) a movie written, directed and starring Billy Bob Thornton (I can never take that name seriously) - really very good, thought the chef didn't enjoy it much. Seamus will be 40 next week, and he's having a large party at his home the following week; P. is doing the food.  Got up early and brought Scott for a walk on the beach; the boiler has packed up (again) and it's quite chilly; very grey and overcast in Dublin today.  I want to read more of 'Memoirs of The Future', then get going on organising my thoughts on Utopianism. I may even start a new blog to marshal my thoughts.  Trim tomorrow to see Barbera on stage - not only has she done all the scenes, artwork & posters for the new production, she's starring as well! What a gal!

       So, this evening I (finally) get time to explore Blogger a bit more. I'm an occasional diarist, but I'm also a note-taker and an archiver. I have lots of different diarys/logs in lots of different media, going back to the mid 1980's.  Lately I've begun to get back into Utopianism, and I'm reading 'Memoirs of The Future'. Once again I feel like talking, talking, talking about the future, and of our (I think) desperate need to figure out better ways of local and global government.  If nothing else, the current invasion of Iraq by the USA goverment shows us that any wealthy group will stop at nothing to secure and continue it's fortunes. Not only does represenatational government fail at national levels, it's lethal at international levels.  The best way to deal with any problem is to solve it. All systems (as I know from work) continually evolve. However the question is so broad, covers so many questions, is based on so many suppostions, it needs a total re-think and re-org at several levels. I want to get a bit more success this time (not sure what I mean by success, though), so I think that a ground-level examination of the entire subject would be a good starting point. Hmmm.

       Just watched the director's cut of 'Cinema Paradiso' on DVD with P. What a movie. I love it (nostalgia), but Peter really, really loves it - it says and means a lot to him. I made us a nice dinner to have before it; tomorrow I'll go home to Trim for a few hours (Salvatore returns!)

        Well, I finally got Mum & Dad down to Kilkenny over the week-end, Sunday in fact. Jentilla & I went in my car from Dublin, and Mum & Dad took John from Trim. I had a table booked in Rinnuccini's for 1330. We had a really nice meal, then headed over for Clashers.   Gran must have heard my requests, because we had beautiful weather. So, they had a quick look around the house (Dad checked out the sheds whilst Mum looked the house over upstairs & downstairs. Tara Mines had had some major problem over the week-end, so Dad was being really good to come down; his boss was on the line trying to get Dad to come back to solve some production problem.  Anyway, they both liked it but thouoght it was way too much work to take on. Dad worried about the electrics (which probably do need a good overhaul), whilst Mum fretted about gypsies murdering us. John was Spy-Gor in the back of the car on the way home, and he sent us an email summary of what was said.  So by the time we were leaving Clashers it was already 1700. We went on to Kilfane with the plan of seeing the gardens, but there was a cloud-burst, and so we called it a day. Once again, thanks to all those who helped organise the sunshine for when I needed it most; appreciated!  The chef was dying to know what was said, and drove me cracked for the last few days waiting for news.  Work is mad at the moment (Moodys Terminal Server installation), plust we're going on strike Friday, so looks pretty eventful. Bar-B-Que Sunday, then New York Tuesday. Yaay!

       Well, I'm really not using my new blog, am I? When I kept a diary as a teenager, I wrote in it every day (how gay is that?!)  It's been a week of unrest at work. In fact, last week my laptop hard drive went ka-boom, which was perhaps a small fore-warning of what was to come. The Bank published a list of the employee benefits that will and will not be transferring over to HP. For the stuff that can't go across, they offered a measly €400 (gross) per year per employee. Because this is the first cold-cash amount up fpr the grabs, the union balloted it's members for strike action, and got it.  The last few non-members of the union in my dept. quickly signed up, sans moi, naturellment. Gary tried to pressure me into joining up, the chump. So the chef and I went over and over it, but in the end it was my decision. Really, I agree with the union position, and I'd never cross a picket line anyway. My main problem with this was the support I've gotten from Colin over the last few years; I was afraid that if I signed up to the IBOA, somwhow it would be a slap in the face for him. However, having spoken with him in private, I discovered this would not be the case. So I signed up (really, the only thing to do given I don't care for the pressure from wither side, and I can't become a manager), but I did so in secret; let whoever finds out find out. The whole thing reminds me of the stuff that went on in Tara in 1996.   Also I was speaking with Conor, who's working on some of the stuff on the HP end. He's begining to find out what the Bank can be like, especially the attitude of ITS. I'm sure it'll all work out, things have a funny habit of doing so, but just not in the way that one thinks it will.  The skip arrived Thursday (after a mix-up earlier in the week), so Thursday evening P & I shifted all the heavy stuff from 31 (the cooker, washing machine, dryer, sofa, etc) and the same from 29 into the skip. Tomorrow (well, today really, as it's 0039 12.07.2003) I'll just dump all the garbage that's been hanging around the house here.  I noted that as a HP employee I'll have the right to work from home (if posible) and also P will be covered on my VHI; should be handy when we move to Clashwilliam.  That's it really; the tickets for New York arrived this week. I've been looking forward to this for so long I can't really focus on it any more. It seems to unrealy.  Did a little bit more work on 'Walking With Scott'. I got loads done on the ending; just need to fill out the middle, really.

We've been having agreat time; walking arund is very tirying, toug.

       Industrial Action!  There's nothing I hate more than taking sides. Of all the stupid, ignorant, primitive ways of humans, this is the worst. It's our 'get out of morals free' card, and it stinks, stinks, stinks.   Anyway, the facts are that today we're all on a 24-hour stoppage because the IBOA (bank union) want to get the best deal going for their members. Whilst I'm a member on paper, I have ZERO respect/regard for the union (or the bank, for that matter), so I'm at home. Monday is a bank holiday, and P & I are off to NYC Tuesday, so this is an early start to my holiday.  So far, I've stayed up until 0330 playing 'The Sims', didn't get up until 1000, brought Scott for a big-walk at Malahide Castle (it's a beautiful sunny morning in Dublin), and now I'm webbing and abount to have a long shower. Then I'll head for The Pavillions. So not so bad, really.

       OK, here we go!  We've now officially moved to Clashwilliam! The last 4 days have been a Big Bang of boxes and bags - but we've finally done it - we now live in Kilkenny!  Very late and tired as I write this, so that's all I'll write for now. Lots to do tomorrow on Day 1 of being a Kilkenny guy (!) - but as I'm on leave for the week, I should have time to write over the next few days. Whilst packing this week-end, I found my old dairy that I started in 1985 (as a very highly-strung 15 year-old), ansd continued up to age 26, just before I came out. So I really want to do some catch-up work on that!  I love the fact that tomorrow is 01.10.2003!

       Just time for a quick blog; settling into Clashers, very tired (stayed out till very late last night to study incredible stars with telescope). Also met with Tom Duncan, and had a meal in Rinuccini's.  Lots of stuff going on, but we hope to be settled down within a few weeks - we're still lacking some of the basics like a cooker and a shower! I have to get on to the electrician tomorrow and see if he's going to come at all or not.  Busy, busy, busy...

       I just learned that The Galileo probe will be sent on it's final encounter with Jupiter on Sunday. I've been busy following the life of this probe since it's launch in 1989 (I was 19!!!), and more especially since the web came in the early 1990's.  It's funny - I really feel for the little guy; a trusty little probe (well, not very big) that outperformed it's own mission criteria by a factor of 4. It's designers and operators deserve the biggest pat on the back going.  In order to protect Europa, and I suppose to have a spectacular end to a spectacular mission, it'll go down in a blaze of glory, in the freezing, gargantuan clouds of the Jovian atmosphere.  Thanks Galileo!   urlLink Galileo End of Mission -- Webcast

       Clashwilliam, Gowran, Co. Kilkenny.  My first blog post in Clashwilliam! I brought my laptop with me from work Friday, and as our phone line is now working, Clashwilliam is now connected to the farthest reaches of the web!  It's a beautiful September morning as I write. Pete's working again today, so once again Scott and I have the place to ourselves. I washed my hair in the sink (roll on power shower!) and then Scottlesburgh & I took a walk. I love this time of the year - blue skies, the leaves turning autumnal, still some heat in the sun. Scot munched down some grass then barfed it back up again (euuh!), so he's miffed that I won't give him his dish. As we recently took down the stud wall in the hallway, the room is filled with sunlight from the entry door. The laptop is on Pete's old writing desk (one of the items that got moved last week), and Lyric FM is playing in the kitchen - what taste!!!  Yesterday I went into Kilkenny at got a few things for the kitchen. I also got a new pair of shoes for work, and a zip-up wardrobe (to keep our clothes in some semblance of order whilst we hunt for some nice wardrobes).  Tom the electrician called round @ 1500, and we went through the work we'd like him to do. I made a bit of tea, then Pete rang to say the PC in the boss's office was in trouble - could I come and help? So I went over, met Pete's boss (and his very handsome son), quickly established they had the WormBlaster virus, and cleaned it up. Whilst I was working they pumped me as hard as they could to find out who I was, how dod I know Peter, etc. I didn't really say anything, but when they quizzed me on why I was down with Peter, did I know the house, etc... Peter's boss (the wiley old so-and-so!) then went to Peter and said "Alan says he moving down to the house in Gowran as well..." which I didn't say at all, but he picked it up and tried it see what Pete would say. Anyway Pete had already decided that he would use the next available opportunity to out himself, and decided that was it. So it went down OK, no screaming fits, and they gave him a big tin of Roses to give to me, as a thank-you for fixing the computer.  David called over for a while, then we just settled down for the evening.  I have to decided if I'm going to town this evening, then come back tomorrow, or I could head for town now, do all my laundry, bring down clothes, etc, then come back tonight. I should finish the painting in the guest room as well, of course. Plus there has to be a major de-webbing... bleh.  I love it all!

       This week-end has been one of the greatest and happiest of my life. Yesterday we borrows a van from a guy who used to delive fruit & veg to Pete when he worked in Malahide. We went over to Pete's mum & dad, loaded the van and the Jeep with stuff from their house. We moved some of the couces and chairs from their house up to 31 Kinsealy, then loaded the van & Jeep with more of our stuff to move down to Clashwilliam. I was a bit nervous about driving the van (large Ford Transit), but I soon got into the swing of things, and so we were off!  I had a real sence of being home when we approached Clashwilliam - the the first time it's turned into a place to my place, for me anyway.  So, we did an enourmous amount of lifting, & moving, much to the entertainment of Pete's dad (who came with us). It was a beautiful sunny day, a real September day, my favourite. I've never seen Clahers looking so good. Barbera, Jentilla & John arrived later in the evening, and had a look around the house. I've never seen the house so sunny or full of people (Ben Quinlan & his daughter turned up as well). Pete was *so* pleased with how his great-great grandfather's table looked in the sitting room, he was so happy.   We then drive back to Artane, took even *more* stuff from there and moved it to Kinsealy, then took all of our heavy items (chairs, the sofa, and endless, endless boxes), and loaded it all up, and down we drove again. We finsihed around 0200, and headed for bed. Had a great lie-in (!) and got up around 1300 Sunday. We went for a walk with Scott, and moved evrything from the van into the house.  So I'm tired (and filthy! We really need a shower there), and I'm back in Dublin. I've just changed my address on all the utilities I'm registered with, and I want to chill a bit before next week (which is going to be murder with Moodys). I won't get to see a lot of Pete, as he'll be working in Kilkenny, and I'll be working late in Cabinteely to finish everything off for Moodys.

       Saw the Aurora Borealis for the first time last night! I noticed what looked like flood-lights far-away on the way home in the car. The night was clear, with a crescent moon almost fully set to the west. As the sky was so clear, I knew it wasn't fog; then I remembered John had taken pictures of a huge sunspot last week, so I twigged it was the Northern Lights!  I called everyone I knew, and when I got home I went out to the lane to have a look. The glow was bright enough to make out the time on my watch! Most of the time there was a faintly-green glowing band, to the north, stretching west to east. However, from time to time, I could see bands, or ribbons, with perpendicular sharp spikes - wonderful! I watched them for about 30 minutes before the cold and the lure of my tea got me back inside!  Later we took Scottlesburg for a trot, and they were still bright in the sky, though not as clearly defined.  So I've finally seen the Northern Lights - life goal achieved! Yaay!

       Well, it's really late at night (or really early in the morning, which ever way you want to look at it), and P is in Dublin and I'm in Clashwilliam. He  had to do an out-door this afternoon, then his parents are coming down to Kilkenny tomorrow, so he's staying with them and I'm down here.  It's my first night on my own here - it's oK - I've spent the evening online, playing games & talking to Thomas. T & C are going through the mill at the moment, thought it seems to be drawing to some kind of conclusion. Even if T does go with C to Melbourne, I'm not convinced that he sees why he should. It really makes me wonder. Anyway, really tired, so off to bed!

       So today was our first real, full days of being real, full Kilkenny residents!  Pete went off to work, so I got up after him and took Scott for a walk up the laneway. It was a beautiful sunny morning - slightly misty, so there were golden sunbeams everewhere. It was so clean, and quiet - beautiful October weather, though warm enough to be like early September. The sky was white, white, white around the sun, then changing to high blue to the west - a fabulous morning, and one that had me in high spirits for the rest of the day. I just wish Pete could have been around, though of course if he wasn't working, he would have been in bed anyway! I've always been an early riser - surely a sunny morning is the best time of any day - the world is fresh, and sunlight like promises, spilling everywhere and filling the whole world with magic. How wonderful to be in such a beautiful place on such a beautiful day. I should note that I saw a rat by the gate near the main road - it didn't try to run when Scott ran over to investigate - it just shivered. On the way back, it looked as though it was trying to turn around, but couldn't. Of course I left it alone (so did Scott), but I guess it was poisoned, and I didn't think that land was poisoned anymore?  Anyway, back to the house, and after a quick bit of dish for Scott, we headed into Kilkenny. I left Scottlesburg in the car whilst I went to the County Council offices for details on refuse and recycling. Next I got paint for the bathroom, frying pans, groceries, over trays... everything that was on my list.  Back to Clashwilliam, we had a bite of lunch, then went on a long walk down the avenue. I called into Liam & Mary, who were busy painting their living room. I think they're delighted that we've moved down at last.  After we came back for our walk (today, the sun never stopped shining), I tackled the kitchen, and basically unpacked, put away, and organised everything.  Next I called John, and by the time we were finished talking, I had run out of energy and enthusiasm for doing any bathroom work at all! So I finished cleaning the kitchen, washed and hung out some tea towels. Pete rang me @ 1800 to say that Mary and Des were over in Shankill (about 10 klicks away) to look at a cottage that Mary is thinking about buying.  Finally, back to Clashwilliam with P where we had our first home-cooked meal (a real mix of chicken & sweetcorn soup, rashers, sausages, beans, toast & cake!)  So that was Clashwilliam day no 1! Couldn't be happier!

       Yesterday Pete had a disaster day at work - his supervisor read him the riot act, and criticisms him very unfaily about stuff she had never mentioned before as being a problem. Major hassle ensued, and Pete threatened to resign. All sorted out in the end, with phone calls from both the lady in question (Anna) and the owner of the business Tommy Roache, who begged Pete not to leave.  We went out for dinner to Cafe Sol (I had booked a table for P's birthday), and we talked it through. Pete decided he didn't want to leave yet, and told the owner in a subsequent phone call.  So today he was back in work, and I did a fair amount of house work, including some DIY plumbing (fitted a new exterior drain-pipe to take bath and sink water.)  We're heading over to Dublin tonight for Bernard's 40th birthday, and tomorrow is hang-the-bathroom cabinet day!  Jentilla headed to London this afternoon for 4 months in McCann's office there.  Tonight one if the NASA Mars rovers lands on Mars - here's hoping they have better luck with their landers than the Beagle2 group did! I may get up early to watch the broadcasts live via the Net.

       Well, I see that my last posting was back in October, when the aurora was glowing above. As today is New Years Day, I'm full of goodie two-showes resolutions, all of which I take seriously. It's just a shame that past performance doesn't auger well!  Still working away in BoI and commuting daily. The 'work-from-home' thing was a bust - bit of lie, really. Given that I don't have any respect for my employers, and I no longer care about my career except in monetary terms, I don't really care!  I did out a mind-map on my plans for 2004 - quite a list, but I hope to get through it.  Pete is 37 today - he's working of course, so we have to wait until tomorrow evening before celebrating.  The house is coming on OK - we had to get a new concrete floor in the living room in order to put down wodden floorboards. That work should resume next week. There's a number of household tasks on my list ofr 2004 - if we accomplish all of them, we'll be dpoing well!  Made a few on-line donations today; Red Cross appeal for the Bam earthquake survivors and SightSavers International.  Pat is here today, so we're going to head into Kilkenny for a few hours, bring the dog, etc. Back to work tomorrow - boo-hoo; I want o play Sims!  Looking forward to 2004!

       Just a quick check-in. It's a grainy Sunday, but things are pretty good, all told.  I suppose the main news is that I'm very seriously hoping to get redundancy from the bank, as we've decided to go for the outdoor catering / b&b in a serious way. We have to decide the best way to fund it, but I just want to do this now. I can't figure out if I just want to be out of the bak, or if I really want to stop IT work. I'm so tired of it, my little bit of self-confidence has been gone for years, and I know it's not the right thing for me to do any more. It's hard to see how I'll get the VSP (Voluntary Severance Package), but if I do; whoo-hoo!  We talked about marriage last night; I'd love to marry Pete - it'll probably br 10 years before the topic even comes under the national forum though!  Did quite a bit of domestic and house-keeping yesterday. Today is personal development, shelve designing, bathroom cleaning & grocery shopping.  Went to 'Cold Mountain' with Pete last night; average. Jude Law; phew! What a bod! Yummy!

       Had a good week-end, thought the chef is very stressed out. After his outdoor on Saturday (which went very well, the Jeep broke down on the way home, near Carlow. As luck would have it, I had just put him on my AA membership, so he was able to get the think towed as far as Gowran. Howeverm he's got a bid outdoor tomorrow in Dublin, and now he's no car. So I'm going to give him my car, we'll go up tomorrow morning, and I'll make my own way to work from the Red Cow.  Beautiful week-end weather-wise, check out the pictures.

       So the ideas are coming in thick and fast - a really tumultuous week as far as Mr. Brain goes. prot, the tadpoles / vegetarianism / veganism and now I'm finding out much more about global warming, and the consequences of climate change.  Of course, Shrubbie (that's George W. Bush) has banned all government scientists from commenting on 'The Day After Tomorrow' movie, the cur. We seem to be headed for global fry-up, rather than freeze-up, but the issues is the same.  Jentilla mailed me this link this morning. There's loads of food for thought in it, and I want to get going on estimating our CO2 emissions from travel / power & heating-oil usage. I heard a scientist from the UK on the radio last week explaining that we really, really are in big trouble weather-wise, and therefore everything else-wise.  Other news; Thomas is 33 today (he bought a new PC), plenty to do tomorrow, but I may be helping Pete with his 2 outdoors tomorrow instead - he's working until 0000 to prepare.  Feeling very unsettled - almost like I'm going through my mid-life crisis (about my 9th!)

       Quiet day today; my replacement is working really well, they getting a good guy! Checked the tadpoles when walking Scott tonight - saw three (worryingly, the three I put in the 'quiet' part of the pool - no sign of the guys who went into the stream side. Told Pete I wanted to become a vegan - I think he thinks it's just another fad - hopefully it is'nt! Had chicken enchilladas for tea, not a great start I suppose.

Anyway, there was a small puddle close to the 'sheep-dip' resevoir by the stream, and this week-end I noticed between 80-100 tadpoles in it. (See the picture) I even topped up the puddle with water from the stream at the week-end.   Anyway this evening when I got home I saw that a tractor had been, driven straight into the puddle, churned it all up, and to cap it off, it had flushed out diesel into the mud. The top of the mud was thick with dead flies (I think) - but I noticed some tiny ripples in the mud - a few of the tadpoles were still there and alive.  So I got the empty salad-box & water bottle from lunch & topped up the sticky puddle with stream water. It was pure brown ooze, but I could see tadpole-shapes, wriggling.  I spent the next hour getting the tadpoles into the bottle and (as carefully as I could) transferring them to the little pool of the 'sheep-dip'. The water became really oily from the ooze that went in along with the tadpoles, and some of the dead flies floated on the top. Rainbow-swirls of diesel Catherine-wheeled from them as the oil seeped away from their bodies and the little current in the sheep-dip made them slowly spin.  I think I rescued between 3 and 6 of the original 100 or so. Three of them swam straight down the bottom of the pool, wriggling away in what looked a healthy manner (given what had happened to them today, and that they were covered in oil.)  Given recent thoughts & communications, and thinking about this rescue mission (which has upset me) I've decided I *need* to be a vegetarian; I can't behave like this then tuck into a steak sandwich, can I? I may as well go the whole hog (N.P.I.) and become a vegan - why go half way?  Poor little tadpoles - I hope at least one makes it to froggy-hood; also I need to learn more about tadpoles & vegans.

       Domestic day. Did dome webbing (email from Gene Brewer!), then off to Carlow to buy internal doors. Looks like we're going to have problems with sitting-room and kitchen doors, as they are so old and small. Spoke with a nice assistant called Barry who explained door sizes to me. So it seems that we may have to speak with a joiner and see what the cost of getting some (or all) of the doors made to order.  It was a beautiful Saturday, so I drove back to Clashwilliam, dropped off some groceries, then Scott & I went on to KK. Town was packed - I browsed a bit in Meubles (drool drool), but refused to pay €700 for a TV stand. So in the end I got one in Argos, then spent 3 hours putting it to gether at home. As Pete says it's a bit 'Wayne & Waynetta', but it'll do fine for the time being.  Then off out to watch the ISS overhead @ 2306 - beautiful evening, the moon a slender crescent setting in the west.

       So last night I saw Bushie & that gom Rumsfeld basically leering and the entire world; the smuggest, most evil and sly creatures to ever wriggle out of the rot-wood of greed.  If I could have the ear of all Americans, I would say this; Look! Look now! Your (restricted) democratic system only allows for 2 parties. The leaders of those parties only get to where they are by having money, big money, and by promising others the chances of getting even more of it. You are now ruled by the most ruthless of people who can only have the interests of their bank-rollers, period. American government is now too privatised - it's only about personal gain. The ideas of leadership are totally gone - the most vicious beast gets to the top.  The same was true in Iraq - a dictator and his two sons got it all by fear, control, extortion and torture. The cruelty of that torture was infamy itself. Now The President of The United States of America is publically thanking the Secretary of Defense for showing the same level of brutality. It's hardly been 1 year. And no-one, NO-ONE is looking around saying "we all know there was no valid 'War On Terror' to be fought in Iraq." No-one is saying "this was for oil, not 'thank you, Secretary of Defence, for defending our country (by allowing low-level soldiers to torture low-level Iraqis)".  It's all over. So let's just be sure we all know where we all stand when presidents stand tall, and people stand low.

       Well, it's been like 100,000,000 years since my last post, but I'm still here.  Well; where to start? Clashwilliam is coming on well, the house is now fully painted (inside, anyway). We got a load of furniture, and the last major item (sitting-room sofa) is on the way - perhaps even this week. Now that summer has arrived the house is looking great, and the painting is really helping the inside light levels. During the week-end I realised I was feeling more familar and 'at home' than ever, malking me realise that I wasn't as settled as I thought (or perhaps have ever been).  Pete is well (except for a small problem he told me about this evening). He's trying to let 29 & 31, and it's a major pain. I think he's considersing selling 1 and renting the other. We had quite a good week-end; the twins from malahide came down Saturday morning, and Joe arrived in the afternoon. the weather was great - it's summer! Joe, the chef & I headed into Kilkenny for a meal in Rinuccini's - beautiful. Lithuania was having it's accession into the EU celebrations in the town, so there was lots of activity.  Was speaking with Barbos earlier today. She's liking Australia very much, but I don't think she'll stay somehow - I hope not. I hope she can come stay with us for a while when she gets back, probably Septmeber.  Had the worst 2 weeks ever in work; really really bad. Major over time though, especially now that I'm contracting. May be getting a place down in Kilkenny - pie in the sky at the moment.  Enjoying Sim City 4 Rush Hour (and listening to the extra sound tracks at the moment) - also doing quite a bit of photography, which I'm really enjoying.  This is me, Dale, signing out! A.

       Earlier today I came across a visual recording of the Cassini launch in 1997. I remember watching that launch - the first live event I watched via the Internet - and wondering what I would be up to when the probe arrived in 2004, then 7 years into the future.  I thought I'd be living in Canada by then. I was in the middle of applying for a working visa at the time. Having visited Canada 2 years before, I had visions of me in a skyscraper looking out on grey Vancouver skies or the glass elevator that brings tourists up the CN tower.  Regardless of where I was living, the ideas of   when   I'd be living were even more exciting. So many things were up-and-coming for the 21st century; the web would be everywhere (it is), mobile devices would be in everyone's pocket (they are) and global warming would continue to cause major weather events (it did).  2001 had always been a goal for me (I   still   think those 4 digits look beautiful; and exciting). So trying to imagine what it would be like when that year was 3 years in the past was really too much - I couldn't do it.  And now here I am and here Cassini is; less than 72 hours from SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) - the end of a journey that took 7 years and over 3 billion kilometres. The JPL/NASA site for Cassini gives a time-line for Cassini's voyage, which makes we wonder what my time-line for the last 7 years would be like. And here's a question that I shows the different ways I look at things; I wonder if I will ever do the same trip, and look at Saturn the same way that Cassini is doing, as I write. It's massively unlikely I won't do it corporeally; but I wonder in spirit?  October 15, 1997 -- Cassini-Huygens launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida October 15, 1997 -- I watch the launch and check the status of my Canadian visa application  April 26, 1998 -- Cassini-Huygens flies by Venus, picking up a boost from the planet's gravity.  April 26, 1998 -- I've spokwn with Trish and decoded there's no point running away to Canada. I decide to go contracting.  June 24, 1999 -- Cassini-Huygens flies by Venus again, getting another "gravity assist." June 24, 1999 -- I post a card for my brother's 18th birthday. I've already met Pete, and can't get him out of my mind.  August 18, 1999 -- Cassini-Huygens gets a third celestial push when it flies by Earth. August 18, 1999 -- I'm finishing my contract for CIE, and hoping to get into the Bank. Pete & I have met for a coffee, but he's seeing someone else.  December 30, 2000 -- Cassini-Huygens flies by Jupiter, snapping photos and getting a final boost. With Galileo still orbiting the planet, it's the first time two spacecraft have explored the gas giant simultaneously. December 30, 2000 -- Pete & I are together almost 1 year. We've bought Clashwilliam, and are planning to renovate & move down.  June 11, 2004 -- Cassini flies by Saturn's moon Phoebe, uncovering evidence that the moon may be a frozen artifact of a bygone era, some four billion years ago. June 11, 2004 -- I'ce taken reduncance from the Bank, but am working an extended 3 month contract with them. We've traveled around Europe & USA. We've moved to Clashwilliam, and I've been commuting +160 miles a day, hence the main reason for leaving the Bank.  July 1, 2004 -- Arrival at Saturn (12:12 a.m. EDT). July 1, 2004 -- Leave full-time employment for the 1st time in 15 years.

       As we did so much on this trip it's hard to know how to lay it out; a simple day-to-day, I think! I'll just start by saying this was the 'Treasures of The Tweed Valley' by our good friend and ciceroni, Tom Duncan (http://www.ciceroni.co.uk/tours/Tours200304/Tweed%20Valley.htm)  We flew to Glasgow on Sunday and were met by John & Nacho at Glasgow airport. They brought us back to John's apartment in Glasgow, which is beautiful - very spacious indeed! We had a good walk around the centre of Glasgow, then had a meal in Cafe Rogano; which was beautiful. Next day (Monday) John drove us to Edinburgh airport, where we met up with Tom & some of the tour group (the rest were arriving by their own means).  Off to the hotel (Dryburgh Abbey, http://www.druburgh.co.uk) where we unpacked and had some light refreshments then headed to Floors Castle (http://www.roxburghe.bordernet.co.uk/floors) where we had a very informative tour, and some more snacks. The main feature of this house which I remember is the unpolished beech furniture everywhere. Historically, the house was important because of it's connections with rebellion & strife during the 16th & 17th centuries.  In fact, we did so much over the week (touring, learning, dining with lords, ladies, dukes & duchesses), I can't write it all down. Check out http://www.ciceroni.co.uk/tours/Tours200304/Tweed%20Valley.htm for an accurate itinerary.  I will say that we met some lovely people, especially Sophie, Ina and Evelyn. My favorite paintings on the trip were by Francesco Guardi and Steenwijk. Check out the pictures!  Next trip is a week sailing on the River Shannon in August with Tom & Stephen.

       OK, this is  alittle strange, I suppose. Just before going to sleep we were talking about the strangest things we've ever seen. I told Pete about the UFO I saw in 1992. SO I drifted off to sleep, and about 30 mins later P is waking me to look at a light that was moiving in the sky.  So. we saw a yellow-ish light, looking a bit like Jupiter but yelloer, and much more of a disc apparant. I knew Jupiter had already set, so it wasn't jupiter. Located in the North West, about 30 degrees, and bobbing away, gently.  We tried to film it with the camera, and ended up getting up, getting dressed, getting my telescope and heading off down the laneway to get a better view (right about now the movie audience would have been screaming "Are you guys crazy?!?! Don't go!!!" So off we went, and just watched the thing. Inthe telescope it was just a yellowy disk, still just little more than a point. Definitely not Jupiter - no atmosphere bands or Jovian satellites. Over about 15 minutes it slowly went from 30 degrees to about 10, until we could no longer see it over the trees.  And that was that! This reporter thinks "weather balloon!" - though they're not usually so low.

       It's a crap emotion, but because I've always taken everything personally, I can't help but feel personally diminished when I do something careless.  So I had to apologise to both the iTSIS ('HP', whatever...) Project 'Manager' and the BoI guy today for not answering my phone yesterday (Sunday). In fact, the problem turned out to be some work that was going on the mainframe, so I wouldn't have been able to do anything anyway - it would have been a total waste of a journey and a Sunday, so I suppose in the end I didn't do too badly.  Beautiful hot day today - hopefully some clear skies tonight; the first in ages. Did someone say "telescope...?" :)  Read a bit about 'Longhorn', the next version of Windows. Me want.

       Just a quick line to say this is coming from my new desk - took from 0730 until 1700 to build (with about 2 hours of a stop) - but the desk looks great. I still have a room of garbage to sort out though, and it has to be done before Joe arrives Friday.  The entire week was fairly manic work wise, as I was doing tickets with Keith, and 1426 suddenly blew up, all over again. We do seem to have gotten it all sorted, though.  Texts from Barbera - she's back in Melbourne (I think), and Thomas, who has a new PC and is addicted to Civ3. I myself had a Sims all-nighter last Sunday (bank holiday) - Io swear I'll never stay up all night again - this time I really mean it!  Pete has been under major pressure too, so Saturday I sorted out No. 31 whilst he did a day for Mary in the castle. I guess I'll be helping a lot more with stuff like this whilst I'm *UNEMPLOYED* from 01.07.2004! His mum & Dad and Owen too came Monday night to stay - first time we've all been together under our roof! We gave them our bed whilst we slept in the guest room - Owen had a sleeping bag on the floor.  Not a whole lot else - studying orbital mechanics (kinda for the interest, kinda for 'Orbiter' simulation, and kinda for the K-PAXiness of it all!  Hopefully going to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' later on with P.

        Well, it's been a busy week - though still no word on the job front. I was supposed to hear (yea or nea) by Friday, but no word at all - maybe no news is good news?     &nbsp;   Today (Saturday) was pretty busy - helping P get an outdoor ready for tonight; plus doing loads of work *on my own* to prepare for Sunday's outdoor for Fingal Council. Today I learned how to dice an onion! I then proceeded to make 2 loafs of bread, Greek salad for 50, potato salad for 50, *34* chicken fillets, beef for 50 (gasp), plus preparing all the cutler and loading the van!     &nbsp;   There's more to do, as when Pete gets home around 2300 we've got to wash all those plates, bowls, cutler, then get them ready for an 0700 departure tomorrow morning. I'm wrecked - definitely not used to standing all day.     &nbsp;   On top of all this prep work we had David, Aneka &amp; Aaron down yesterday - entertaining &amp; prepping at the same time.     &nbsp;   So - where am I? At the start of the year I determined to try to join a futurist group, but I've not done that. OK, I could subscribe to the World Future Foundation, but that seems like just another magazine.    I totally want to give my thoughts on the future, science &amp; society, a frame-work; but what??!! I don;t have an idea for a book (though it doesn't have to be a meisterwerk, I suppose) - I'd love it to be more a novel, which explains my ideas about the future without being a treatise.     &nbsp;   What do I think about the future? Ultimately, time will continue, without me, and with or without the current human race from Earth. Period.&nbsp;Eventually of course the sun will expire, and we'll either have moved on enough so that it doesn't matter&nbsp;for our survival, or we'll have figured out a way to&nbsp;keep it as is.&nbsp;     Why  do I think about the future - ahh, the ?64000 question.    The Universe is everything - and everything is the Universe. That means that the Sun is a bit of the Universe, your fillings are little bits of the Universe, the Virgo super-cluster is a bit of the Universe, your smile is a bit of the universe, pi is a bit of the universe,&nbsp;George Bush is (unfortunately) a bit of the Universe and the collection of neurons in my brain that made&nbsp;me add the '(unfortunately)' comment just now are also bits of the Universe.    If I've learned anything in my 34 years, it's that everything that is, both large and small, young and old, is,  together , the Universe. If you've ever studied anything, you will surely realise that arriving at this conclusion is as&nbsp;incredible as any revelation.       So here we are, and to me it seems that this simple truth just doesn't make it out into the world, in terms of everyone's day-to-day business. It's like shopping and kinds and work and TV and travel and lunch and cars and pamphlets and advertising and money is more immediate, so it gets more coverage - personally, locally, nationally and globally.     &nbsp;   I think, IMHO etc, that we've learned a lot, and it's a shame to not allow our knowledge to lead us on. We seem to think we need leaders, and those leaders should be  other people ; why is this?     &nbsp;   Am I so cynical; do I really believe that  human nature  is what stops us from being eternal? I do; I do I do I do.     &nbsp;   I've ranted enough; the day you start to belief that the world would be a better place if everyone thought like you is the day&nbsp;to turn into a tyrant, right?

       Well, we've been having a fine old time of it. We spent the week getting a bit of a garden in order, reading, cooking, relaxing; it's just the best!  My folks are coming tomorrow (Sunday), so we're trying to get the house in order before they arrive. Hopefully they'll like the place - they haven't been before Christmas, so the place is vastly changed from when they were here last. Poor P. is a bag of nerves!  Jentilla is having a blast in Oz; she really, really likes it there. That's about it! I've been panicked, not-panicked about working. Yesterday I mailed my friend Alanna, and I have to admit I felt a little, well, like a sell-out because I was looking for another job. But we need the cash!  Happy :)

       Well, we've done it. Not only are we both living done here, but yesteday was my last day at work in Cabinteely. As would friend Gary would say, I've cut the cord! Actually, yesterday was momentous not just becase I left 15 years of continuous employemnt (for one firm or another), but also Pete traded in the Jeep! We now have a silver Ford Courier van (which I was driving around Kilkenny all this morning!). Also, Mary called over to the house, with a beautiful antique wall clock as a gift!  As if that weren't enough, Cassini made SOI perfectly in the wee small hours of this morning - that's a real milestone for me because I've been watching the mission progress with considerable interest since launch in 1997 - see other posts about Cassini!  So, Pete was in Archersrath today, so I brought Scott for a walk, cleaned the kitchen, loaded the van with our domestic waste & recycling. Off to Dunmore with that lot, then back to town to retrieve Pete's West Link barge which he left in the Jeep. Then I ordered prints from our photolist, and got the making of a lunch before heading back home. I carried the bed for the guest room upstairs and assembled it - though my drill ran out of charge, so i had to stop that for a few hours.  Now I'm off to have lunch before settlingdown to... not sure. Finish 'Angels & Demons'? Sims? Ah, un-employment!
