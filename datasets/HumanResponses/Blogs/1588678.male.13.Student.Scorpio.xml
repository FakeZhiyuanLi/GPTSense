      Over the weekend there was a grand opening for this new theatre in downtown Walnut Creek. It's a  urlLink Century  14 theatre. To make things better, they had $.50 popcorn and soda and free game-play from July 25-27. What sucks is that I didn't get the chance to go to the new theatre. Instead, we went to the Brendan Theatre in Concord and to (try to) keep people their, they too had $.50 popcorn and soda. How sad. A couple of years ago they made a Century Theatre in Pleasent Hill, which I still go to. They're sweet! I hope I go soon. I'll tell you what I think about it.

      Yesterday, my friend and I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. It's great! There's a lot of comedy, which comes from Johnny Depp's character; Jack Sparrow or should I say Capitin Jack Sparrow (for those whom saw the movie already). I read on the internet that Johnny Depp based his character on Keith Richards (eyes wide open, hand gestures, stuff hanging from his hair, ect.). The one thing that pissed me off most was the lady behind us. Her cell phone rang twice. Once in the beginning of the movie, and once near the middle. I felt like turning around and yelling, "Turn your damn phone off you butt-nugget!" The only reason I didn't say that is because it was the third time I had seen the movie.  Any-hoo, you should see this movie. It's well worth the price of a ticket. For this movie, I'd give it four stars.

      Lately I've been whatching Adult Swim. It's really good. If you aren't familiar with Adult Swim, how's about I give you some feedback.   Adult Swim is basically a combination of comedy catroons that were cancled. Some of those cartoons are; Sealab 2021, Futurama, Brak, Family Guy and other cartoons. They're all funny as hell! The only downfall to Adult Swim is that Sealab 2021 and Brak are on once a week and are on at midnight, but Futurama and Family Guy are on at 11:00 (p.m.).   So, if you catch yourself wondering, "What the hell happened to Sealab 2021?!" Know you know. I'm almost positive Adult Swim is on Cartoon Network. You should defiantly check it out.

      Lately I've been playing Grand Theft Auto 3 for my PC. It's a very fun game. What kind of a game doesn't allow you to run over hookers and steal cars. I discovered  urlLink Cheats  online. Some of the cheats will come in handy at some point. Plus, GTA3 is now on sale for only 20 bucks. So far I'm at the level I think is called "Pump Action Pimp." I do intend on spending countless hours playing GTA3. You should buy it. You will buy it.

      For the next couple of days, Mars will be easily seen from Earth. Mars hasn't been this close to Earth since the Neanderthals were around (about 60,000 years ago). From what I've read on Yahoo, Mars is about 34,646,418 million miles away.

The only down fall is that if you don't have Quicktime 6 you won't get any sound, but my brother told me that Quicktime 6 doesn't take long to download. So check it out bee-ach! Word!

      Since Chris Rock is the host of this years VMA's on  urlLink MTV , they made a  real  funny commercial. In the commercial, Chris Rock asks where his dressing room is. He ends up in Jack White of The White Stripes' dressing room. He comes out in a red and white suit and says,  "Their first album's better."  Then he ends up in Missy Eliot's dressing room and comes out in a blue jump-suit. Then he ends up in 50 Cent's room and says,  "Hey 50!"  After he says that you hear a couple of bangs and a thump on the floor.  You gotta see the commercial. You can't miss it. It's on  all  the time.

      Lately, I've been talking like a rapper. You know,  "Fashizzle,"That bing-bling is illin'," and "What's crackin' nigga! Word!"  Man, I'm so white. Durning school all the rap-guys try to teach me the lingo. Knowing me, I suck at it. Even thou I'm into rock 'n roll, I try, damn hard!   Okay, it seems that maybe rock 'n roll should have it's own language, or R&B, and even techno! Wouldn't that be cool? Well, I'll try coming up with a rock 'n roll or techno language. Later dawg!

      Today I went to this place called Boomers out in Livermore for my friend's birthday. It's so cool! Boomers is a place were you go for your birthday. They have mini-golf, a recroom, and go-cart-racing. Okay, lemme get back to the party. We did EVERYTHING! The best activity was the go-cart-racing. The go-carts go 20 to 24 m.p.h. and the course has lots of sharp turns. Man, the whole time I was go-carting, I was just gunning it! We probably raced for 15 minutes, but after 10 minutes this dumb-ass-chick was turning and I was right behind her going FAST . . . real fast! As she turned she came to a total stop and I rammed right into her. The rules say not to bump into other drivers. After that an employee came to me and blamed me for running into her. Come on!!! It's her fault. She's the moron!, not me!  Other than that, my friend and I had a great time. I'm definitely coming back!

      A couple of days ago I bought the new Jane's Addition CD. Dude, it's AWESOME!!! It's full of kick-ass songs like "True Nature," "Just Because," and "Price I Pay." Boy, I tell ya, Dave Navarro plays hella good guitar. Since I only bought it a couple of days ago, I've been listening to it day and night! It's that good! I must say, I'll have to put it on my Top 10 Favorite CDs. So, if you have some extra cash go out and buy this CDs. It ROCKS!!! The CDs called, "Strays," and the band is called Jane's Addiction. So go out and buy it you monkey!

      I just bought tickets for the Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline in Mountain View. It's sweet. The line-up is absolutly bone-chilling! So far the line-up is: Pearl Jam, Wilco, Willie Nelson, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, (unfortuntely) Incubus, and many more! I will expect a big-ass tribute to Johnny Cash (especially from Willie Nelson). Knowing me, I'm gonna flip-out cause I'm gonna see Pearl Jam and Wilco. I'm also anxious about seeing Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. What a line-up!   This ain't no AFI concert where you can wait days after tickets go on sale and honestly expect to get tickets. For a concert like the Bridge School, when it says,  "Tickets on sale 10 a.m. on Sunday,"  they mean it. DO NOT expect to just get tickets a hour after they go on sale. That my fellow brothers is pure 100% stupidity!  Well, I'm kinda too tired to type, so this is Seth saying,  "Adios amigos!"

      I know it's kinda late to write about the deaths of Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon, but we were getting carpet installed and walls painted. So, I share my thoughts about Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon.  Johnny Cash was one of the most respected musicians of our time. From the beginning of his career to his last years, he continued to make music that would inspire so many musicians today. "American IV" shocked me in a way. I'm mean, he's a 73 year old guy who's lived a rough life and still makes awesome albums. He's inspired so many country musicians and even well known punk bands like Social Distortion.   Warren Zevon, too, was an important artist. For some reason, Warren Zevon reminded me of Frank Zappa. Whether you were touched by his amazing lyrics or you put on a smile while listening to songs like Excitible Boy, Warren Zevon had a way with music. Even during his illness he managed to put out an amazing album, "The Wind." This shows how stong the man really was.    This post is dedicated to Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon for their great contributions to music.     Johnny Cash (1932 - 2003)    Warren Zevon (1947 - 2003)

      Yesterday I went to the concert of a life time; The White Stripes!!!!! What made this event great was that it was near by, at the Greek Theatre, and it was on a Saturday!  The opening band, I'm a Robot, sucked. The lead singer of the band is 80s rock meets Canadian rock band. Every song they played, the lead singer would take off an article of his clothing. I'm telling ya, near the end of their performance he was down to his pants and I was gonna walk out if he took them pants off. I mean, the guy wasn't the most atractive guy in the world.  Once the opening act was done, to pass the time they played old Betty Boop and Little Audrey cartoons on the big screen. Everyone liked it, but after the second or third cartoon it was getting real old real fast. They ended up playing like 10 cartoons. It was torturous knowing that The White Stripes were next, but we're stuck whatching Little Lulu cartoons.  As far as songs go, The White Stripes played all of my favorite songs. What caught me off guard was the fact that they played more of their old stuff and that people knew the old songs. I tought I was the only one who listened to their old albums over and over again. Even thou they didn't play much of Elephant, they did play the two great guitar songs;  "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,"  and  "Ball and Biscuit."  The solos for "Ball and Biscuit" are dope. It was great, the opening song,  "The Big Three Killed My Baby,"  Jack White broke and string, therefore he played that song with five strings and three fingers (he had a slide on his pinkie). And I respected the fact that he recited lyrics to Johnny Cash's  "I've Got Stripes."  I guess it was better than reciting lyrics to the cover of "Hurt" or the song "Ring of Fire."  This time I give the concert a whomping *****!!! The only complaint I had was the fact that it seemed as if the opening act performed longer than The White Stripes. Other than that it was the best concert I've ever been to in my life! Good luck to Adam!

      Today, my brother and I were discussing the article in the lastest Rolling Stone about the 100 Greatest Guitarists. Even thou everyone knew #1 would be Jimi Hendrix, and he was, but the dead-give-away was that Jimi Hendrix was on the cover. I'm not saying I don't like Jimi Hendrix, I just saying, well, he is the #1 guitarist ever!   Anyways, my brother and I discussed who should have been in the top 100. There's Billy Corgan from The Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan, Stevie Van Zant from The E-Street Band, both guitarists from Pearl Jam (not Eddie Vedder, the other two), and Mick Jone from The Clash. All and all, it was a fairly good list. They had Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, Frank Zappa, and Jack White of The White Stripes whom came in at 17! Pretty damn good for a guitarist who's still alive.   I must say, Rolling Stone Magazine has stayed hip, as in sticking with Rock and Punk music unlike shitty MTV. Well if you are into rock, check out the article and see if you agree whid-it, aeeet?

      Well, it looks like Seth's birthday gift came early this year!  Suburban Myths is now hosted under  urlLink Blogspot Plus 25 .  This means you can look forward to viewing pictures, downloading media, and never having to look at an ad again (unless Seth starts selling ad space!).    Thanks to Kimmy at Blogger for upgrading the site for me while Blogspot's online ordering was down.  And congratulations to Seth on moving one step closer to adulthood!  Let me know what it's like to be a grown-up.  I'm still not sure.  And while I'm at it, Seth and I both wish our brother Adam a happy birthday.  Stay away from open flames, man.

      Okay, Saturday I went to the Bridge School Benefit Concert. This years Bridge School Benefit Concert was off the wall! Excellent weather, excellent line-up, and excellent performances.   The performances were in this order: Neil Young, Dashboard Confessional, Wilco, Counting Crows, Indigo Girls, Incubus, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. Each band played about 5 songs taking up about 40 minutes.  Neil Young - Simply great! If there’s one man who can manipulate an acoustic guitar, he’s the man! He played I think 4 songs. He opened with the song “Sugar Mountain.” After a couple of songs he had Native American dancers join the stage to dance to the song “There Comes a Time.” It was real cool. The main dancer was in a red and white bird feathered coat with a big-old feathered hat. That was amazing! Plus, Neil Young seemed to have a sense of humor. At times he’d make some funny remarks that kept the crowd happy.  Dashboard Confessional - They were okay. The band is good and all, but the singer got annoying after a while. Some of their songs were good and some make you want to pull out a 12 gage shotgun and shoot that mother up! Believe me when I tell you that I didn’t go to see them. I ain’t no loser. They played like 4 or 5 songs and that’s 4 or 5 songs too many. Hehehe.   Wilco - One word; awesome! Going to the Bridge School, I was really looking forward to seeing Wilco. They put on an awesome show. They only played one song from the album “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” which was a bummer. That was a great album. They may’ve played some of their old stuff, but I’m not 100% sure on that. What made them stand out the most was the fact that they didn’t sound different from their albums. I mean, Pearl Jam makes albums with a lot of electric guitar and it’ll sound different when they play those songs acoustic, but Wilco does acoustic for their albums so their sound wasn’t different. I liked that. They’re pianist was very good too! In fact, the piano works well with the band. Other than that, they were real good.  Counting Crows - Good. No complaints about them. They played all of their good songs. They probably played 5 songs. They opened with “Rainman.” It was really good. They lead singer also had a good sense of humor. When he played “Long December” on the piano, he had the wrong beat in the middle of it and stopped the whole performance and said, “Let me try that again.” Then he finished it with the right beat. I was expecting to have Vanessa  Carlton perform with Counting Crows on the song “Big Yellow Taxi,” but they didn’t even play that song.    Indigo Girls - Not much to write about them. Crappy songs and very annoying. The main guitarist was good though. Most girl guitarists just play cords, but she was wippin’ out some radical notes lemme tell ya. They probably played 6 songs. One of the songs was way to long. It’s called something like, “The Chicken Man.” Judging by the name of that song I knew it’d be a spoon full of ass kind of song.   Incubus - Not much to write about them either. Their songs seemed to go on forever. They played like 6 songs. They opened with “Driven” or “Drive,” whatever it’s called. They have a good guitarist but a  crappy singer. The first minute of his singing annoyed the hell out of me. Other than that, they weren’t all that good.  Pearl Jam - Oh yeah!!! AWESOME! It was my first time seeing them live and boy, it won’t be the last! They opened with the Bob Dylan song “Masters of War.” In fact, Pearl Jam played a lot of covers. Some of the cover songs they did were: “I Believe in Miracles” by the Ramones and a tribute to Johnny Cash by playing the song “25 Minutes to Go.” They also played “Daughter” and a new Pearl Jam song called “Man of the Hour,” so I guess this means we’ll be seeing a new Pearl Jam CD on the racks hopefully soon. Eddie Vedder actually dedicated the song “Last Kiss” to his “girlfriend,” Mary, who now attends UC Berkeley. Eddie said to Mary on stage, “I told her that we should keep it touch, but she said ‘I’m not good at writing back’ so we’re going to have to work on that.” That was truly a nice thing for Eddie to do.   Willie Nelson - I bow down to the living legend and I mean it. Willie kick-ass! He was so amazing and he can play guitar like no one else. It’s great, he plays this acoustic guitar from the 50s with thousands of autographs of the people he’s performed with along with friends. This no pick-protector on that guitar so most of the coating on the guitar has been chipped off. And the man doesn’t stop! And I mean, DOESN’T stop! After he finishes a good 3 minute song, he waits not even 10 seconds before he continues on a new song. That proves how capable he is to just take the performance to a whole new level. And he too had used a good sense of humor with the crowd. He just seems like an all around good guy. For the 4 or 5 songs he did, he performed with style and grace at the same time.  Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young - Best EVER!!!!! They were the best act of all 9 acts. They were amazing! Whether Neil Young is rockin with the harmonica or Steven Stills in jamming a spectacular clash of notes and cords, they all hit it out of the park! They all did wonderful songs including a very good performance of “Déjà Vu.” Also a wonderful song they played was the Buffalo Springfield song “For What It’s Worth.” Other songs played were “Harvest Moon,” “Our House,” and “Teach Your Children.” In between their performance, David Crosby told the crowd, “In this band we all have jobs. My job is to write the weird shit.” That was great! The performance of CSNY seemed like they all said to each other to pick a song to play. That made the performance great too! All and all, they were indeed the soul performance of the night, no doubt about it.         Well, the Bridge School Benefit Concert this year was amazing! So here are my grades for each band and why the got the grade they got. And if you don’t know what * means, it’s a star. Neil Young - **** because he didn’t play a lot of songs. Dashboard Confessional - *** just because of the annoying voice of the singer and some of the songs were badly performed. Wilco - ****1/2 because they didn’t play a lot of stuff from their latest album “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.” Counting Crows - ***** because of the songs they played and their ability to put on a good acoustic show. Indigo Girls - *** just because they had a good guitarist. Incubus - ** because they suck! We’ll their songs seemed to drag forever and the singer was crap. Pearl Jam - ****½ because they didn’t play a lot of their songs. Willie Nelson - ***** basically because he rocks! Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young - *****! They were amazing!!! They were the best of any of these bands! So if you got enough money go to the Bridge School Benefit Concert. If you love rock n roll, you’ll love the Bridge School!

      I just finished watching the De La Salle Spartans’ game on ESPN 2. Once again, their streak continues. De La Salle is now 145 games straight making them the #1 High School Football Team in the Nation. Even though everyone knew De La Salle was going to slaughter any team they had to face, they brought in this team from Louisiana. Their school is Evangelic Christian High School. In case you don’t know who De La Salle is, they’re a well known Catholic school in sunny Concord, CA. Two religious schools. Gee, I wonder who’s side God was on? Okay, back to the game. De La Salle won 27 to 10. Even though De La Salle won, Louisiana was the one threat to De La Salle. Well, they’re not much of a threat anymore, hehehe.   Thanks to that suck-ass Astroturf at the DVC, De La Salle’s starting quarterback screwed up his leg when he was running and his feet just got stuck in Astroturf. I imagine he’ll be out for a while. I’ll try to get his name.   Well, De La Salle’s unstoppable! 145 games straight. Bring on any team and we’ll chop their balls off and use them as earrings. That’s what we do round these parts. Mmhmm. Oh yeah, before I forget, you can e-mail me and ask me questions or just give your opinion about Suburban Myths. So long.

      I’m meant to publish this post yesterday but my computer was on the fritz and it didn’t publish. So here it is. The greatest movie EVER!!!!!   Yesterday I saw the greatest movie EVER!!!!!. Not Star Wars or Manos: Hands of  Fate . . . Wait, Manos: Hands of Fate was pure 100% crap. Okay, the greatest movie I’ve ever seen was Scarface. Thankfully I was able to borrow it. Lemme give you two words to sum up how awesome it was: FRIGGIN’ AWESOME!!!!! It was great! I couldn’t believe how truly amazing it was.  The movie’s basically about a criminal from Cuba who comes to America and ends up selling cocaine and kills so guys here and there. You may be asking what you’d expect from a movie like this. I tell you. 2 hours and 35 minutes of killing, cocaine, and a Cuban guy who probably says "fuck" a thousand times. My kind of movie.   Al Pachino was great! He was "The One" to play this role. I mean, his character, Tony Montana  is a total sociopath.  He’ll kill anyone for anything. And Al Pachino had some of the greatest line’s and insults in the movie like,  "Fuck you!,   "Cockaroaches,"  and  "Wasp-Whore."  Who comes up with that stuff? The guy’s insane! I mean, if anyone screws with him he will just kill them. That just goes to show you; be careful who you screw with because they  may just pull out an AK 47 and gun you down sucka!     Why I’m gonna cover the music is beyond me. Okay, the music was real good! It was all 80s music. Just cuz I’m a rock ‘n roll freak doesn’t mean I don’t like 80s music. In fact, if you’ve ever played Grand Theft Auto 3, you may have noticed that the songs played on Flashback FM are all featured in Scarface. Most of those songs are played in the dace-club. All and all, I thought the music was sweet!  Okay, for the movie Scarface, I gotta give it *****! I highly recommend you go out and rent or even buy it. You’ll love it! But, as a heads up, it will take you probably a half an hour to adjust to Tony Monatan’s Cuban accent. Okay, I’m getting so excited that I’m gonna watch it again! Good night world.

      A blond walks into an auto-store. She goes up to the counter and asks the manager,  "Do you have any 7-1-0's?  The manager looked at her and asked what a "7-1-0" was. She said that it's on the engine. The manager asked what is looked like. She said it was round and black and it said,  "710."  The manager stared and asked that the blond to draw the 710. So she drew the 710 and handed it to the manager . . .  Okay, unfortunitly I need this photo to finish the joke and to show what a 710 is, but I don't have blogger pro, so I'll just write whats on the picture and hopefully put it on this post.  . . . The picture of the 710 was an "OIL" cap upside-down. Hehe. Its more funny with the picture thou. Believe me, I'll get this photo on this sight,  for I am Suburban Myths!

      On Friday, I stayed at my brothers house. What did we do you may be asking, well, we watched the worst friggin' movie on planet Earth! We watched Mystery Science Theater 3000: Manos The Hands of Fate. Manos the Hands of Fate has to be the worst movie  EVER!  It's about a family that is driving, their car breaks down, and they're stuck at this hotel who's owner is the devils priest and this dude named Torgo. Torgo is one creepy mofo. His says stuff like,  "I take care of this place while Master's away,"  and  "Master wants you, but Master can't have you."  Plus, he's dressed like a homeless person, and he has pillow underneath the legs of his pants. Tell me thats not weird. And for some reason there's this couple who's having sex in their car and these two cops tell them to stop having sex. This happens multiple times and the same cops bust them. That whole part had nothing to do with the movie.  So, to sum it all up, it was the worst 2 hour movie I had to sit through, and the sad thing is people actually paid to see it in theaters (tisk, tisk). Curse my brother black heart for showing me this movie, but, it's a movie every man has to see. And he was "Passing the tourch" down to me like he did for our other brother. So, show this movie to others, as my brother did to me.

      Yesterday my dad and I went to the 46th Car Show in San Francisco. It was AWESOME!!! They had all sorts of cars. From exotic cars like the Lamborghini and Ferrari to the big American names such as Cadillac and Ford, they had it all! Going to this show is real fun. They have the show on the week of Thanksgiving and they not only show off new cars but they let you sit in them, except for cars like the Lamborghini and Maserati. It’s real cool sitting in a brand-new 2004 Porsche Carrera or a 2004 Cadillac CTS. I think that it’s torture for some people, I mean, people with sit in a 2004 Cadillac CTS and get real comfy, but then they realize that can’t afford a car that expensive. It’s always fun. I went last year, had a great time, and I hope to go every year to check out the new models.   I really have a passion for cars. That’s the reason I went, duhhh. I went in all sorts of cars. I’ll tell you some of the coolest cars I went in. I went in the Cadillac Escalade EXT, the Chevrolet Corvette, the Audi TT Roadster, and the Porsche Boxster. They all friggin’ awesome! Sadly, this year they didn’t show the Batmobile like they did last year. Oh well. Okay, so if you’re into cars, you got 7 bucks, and you live in the bay area, then go to the annual car show in San Francisco. You’ll have fun.       Click  urlLink here  for a cool car pick.

      I just watched the newest episode of Survivor: Pearl Islands. Oh God, if you watch it, this was the one to see! If you do watch it, you’re all familiar with the cast member Jon. He’s the blond guy who’s always joking around and pissing people off. Well, when they had the reward challenge they brought in each cast member’s loved one. They would ask questions and the cast member and their loved one’s answer had to match and if they got it right they had someone else’s loved one take one step closer to jumping off a plank. Once the loved one’s came out the cast member and loved one hugged and said hi. When Jon said hi to his buddy, Jon asked how his grandma was. His friend whispered that his grandma had died. Jon just broke down in tears. Once he sat down he explained that his grandma died. Everyone was real sympathetic. After the reward challenge the cast members threw the challenge for Jon. So, since Jon won he got to spent the day with his buddy collecting information regarding his grandma’s death at a separate island. Once they got there and they were alone, Jon turned to his friend and said, “Nice job!” So, Jon’s grandma never died and he lied about it so he’d win the challenge. Before the game Jon told his friend to save him by telling him at the game that his grandma died so save his ass. It was great, Jon’s friend said in the beginning, “Your grandma died, dude.” It was hella funny! So Jon’s pretty safe for now. It was so horrible, and the best part is that no one knows that he lied. As bad as it was it was friggin’ geniuses. If you are into shows like The Mole, you’ll like Survivor. It’s on Thursdays on CBS at 8. You love it. This is Seth a.k.a. G-Funk signin out yo!

      Today I went to see The Cat in the Hat. I know, that makes me sound desperate. One word: CRAP! It was really bad. It was so boring and annoying. I mean, Mike Myers got a bit old in that movie. There was a couple of seines that were kinda funny but the rest was horrible. Believe me, if Dr. Suess lived to see this movie he’d die at how much they destroyed the story making it into a movie. I don’t have anything against Mike Myers, he’s one of my favorite actors, but this wasn’t his best film period.   The Cast - Fine to me, wait, oh shit: Alec Baldwin! Mike Myers was well so-so. He’s great in all his other movies. He kinda got annoying after 10 minutes which added a lot of crappiness to the film. Everyone knew that when they were gonna make Cat in the Hat into a movie, the one to play Cat would either be Jim Carrey or Mike Myers. The kids in the movie weren’t that bad. I don’t think they’ll make it very far, but they were good. Kelly Preston was, I guess okay. She only had like 4 parts in the movie. And Alec Baldwin, I ain’t goin there man!   Upside of The Film - The town they built for the movie was real cool. It’s this town in the middle of these lush-green valleys and everyone drives a yellow or green Ford Focus. Every house is purple. They really did a good job of making the town look like the one from the book. Along with the town they really pulled off creating the Cat. They did real good. Mike Myers was doing this interview on TV and mentioned that being to Cat in the Hat was easy because it took them like 2 hours, but when he did Fat Bastard it took something like 5 hours. One would wonder what it’s like being in a Cat suit or a 1,000 lb. Scottish bastard.   Okay, I give this film ** cause I’m feeling generous today. If you have young children you should take them to see it but if your desperate to see a movie on Sunday like me go see something else. Don’t make the same  mistake I did.

      Last week I went to Eddie Bauer in Walnut Creek to see Jim Whittaker. If you aren’t familiar with the name, he was the first American to successfully climb Mount Everest. Eddie Bauer supported the 40th anniversary of the climb be inviting anyone who wanted to come and watch, plus Jim was good friends with Eddie Bauer. Basically, Jim talked about the climb and had a slide show. It was pretty cool. Even though I don’t do any real mountain climbing, I thought the event was tight!   One thing about Jim Whittaker is that he has a great sense of humor. He’d make all these funny jokes and stores. One of the stores he was talking about was when he climbed the K2 Mountain in Korakoram Range, Pakistan - China Border. The K2 Mountain is the 2nd highest mountain in the world. Anyways, he and his crew got to a point where there’s a steep-ass mountain that is thin and goes straight down. Since they were on the border, Jim said to his crew, “You know, this is the one place where you can take a dump on China and pee on Pakistan.” That was great!   I really couldn’t believe my ears when he said he was 80. I mean, I didn’t know how many years its been since he climb Everest, I wasn’t even born! The guy looks like he’s in his 60s. Pretty weird, ehhh? And to celebrate the 40th anniversary, he tried climbing Mount Everest but only went about 10,000 feet. That’s pretty damn good for an 80 year old guy!   At the end of the slides and stuff he signed books so I bought one. I said hi and shook his hand and asked what it was like climbing Mount Everest. He laughed and answered me saying it was great and to follow up the answer he wrote, “Good climb.” It was cool. I’m thinking maybe going to this thing will inspire me to climb Everest. Maybe I will or maybe I’m getting ahead of myself.

      Lately I’ve been watching the show Viva La Bam. It’s so funny!!! I was literally about to piss my pants I was laughing so friggin hard! I loved the show Jackass, so when I herd that Bam Margera was gonna have his own show I knew I’d love it. That guy drives his parents nuts, which adds some of the funniness in the show.   So far I’ve seen two episodes. I saw the “Don’t Feed Phil Day” episode and I saw “The Family Reunion” episode last night. The Don’t Feed Phil Day episode was so funny! The deal is that Bam’s 400 lb. Dad can’t eat anything except for a glass of hot water for 24 hours. He starts out by weighing his dad. The second he steps on the scale it says “error.” I mean, the guy’s so fat that the scale says error. How funny is that?! Then later that day Bam’s dad went to an eating festival. Bam followed him. In one hour Bam’s dad ate hotdogs, hamburgers, pasta, pizza, and sandwiches. Then the next day at 12 am, Bam woke his dad up to tell him that Don’t Feed Phil Day had officially started. Bam, who plans ahead, thought his dad may try to go out and get something to eat, so Bam posted signs in every restaurant, bar, and grocery store in town that said, “Don’t Feed Phil Day ” along with a picture of Phil on it, and boy they sure as hell worked. He even had street signs and bumper stickers that said “Don’t Feed Phil Day,” and an airplane flew over the town with the words Don’t Feed Phil Day on it. I felt bad for Phil cause he went in to bars and restaurants trying to order food, but people who worked at those restaurants pointed at Don’t Feed Phil Day signs in their restaurants. Near the end of the day, Bam went to a rock concert. When he left, Phil’s brother, the famous, Don Vito came over and attempted to order a pizza while Bam was gone. Thanks to Phil’s wife, April, she called Bam to tell him what was going on. Bam was mad, so he came home, along with hundreds of people from the concert and the band with him. They came in time. They decided to finish the concert at Bam’s parent’s house. In the end Phil didn’t eat for 24 hours, so they celebrated by blind-folding Phil and feeding him sandwiches with candy and chips and all sorts of crap in it. Then in the end Don Vito showed off his toe-nail that had broken off but was still hanging by a thread. Uhhh, it was gross! They pulled it off with pliers and decided to smell it. At one point after Ryan Dunn (cast member of Jackass) smelled the toe and vomited by the sinister smell. It was so funny!   The Family Reunion episode was the best of the two. Oh god it was so friggin funny!!! Bam has a friend who calls himself Compton Ass Terry. He great! Compton Ass Terry and Bam decided to get Phil some bling-bling. Back to the reunion. What can I say about Bam’s family? Well, everyone in the family is 400 lbs. Apparently everyone on Bam’s father’s side of the family grew up in a town where there was pollution and that sort of crap, so Bam feels it really screwed up that side of the family. In fact, one of Bam’s uncles just got out of jail and went straight to the family reunion. In fact he was still wearing his orange jail uniform. Anyways, Bam decided to do something special for this “special occasion,” so he decided to make his house look like a medieval-time’s castle. He made a draw-bridge and everything. He even had an elephant at the house. Okay, the food, he got meat, meat, and more meat! He even got a whole pig! At one point during the dinner, Don Vito ate the pig’s eye, downed 2 beers, then ate a lit cigarette! He is amazing!!! After that happened one of Bam’s grandmothers decided to leave. She was furious! She proceeded to yell, “This family’s crazy,” and Bam, with his devilish smile answered, “Yes, we are.” This is where in got real funny, Bam got a letter from the Home Owners Association giving them a $500 fine for having an elephant in their front yard. Bam read out loud some of the letter and it said, “. . . You are receiving a $500 fine because an elephant was reported in your front yard . . .” Along with that, Bam got a thank you letter from his neighbors thanking them for letting the neighbors kids play with the elephant. Oh god it was hilarious!!! That sure was a family reunion to remember.

      If anyone knows where I could buy a fake M16 with attached M-203 Grenade Launcher (like the one in the movie Scarface), let me know. It can be an airsoft one or just fake plastic, and make sure it's not too expensive. If you can help me, click on the "Contact me here" thing on my links. Thank you fans!

      A couple of hours ago I watched this weeks Viva La Bam episode. Although I only saw the last 15 minutes of it, I don’t think I missed too much. Anyways it was the episode when Bam sends his parents to a nice hotel while him and other professional skateboarders such as Tony Hawk and Kevin Saab turn his parent’s house into a huge skate park. Oh, this was a good one! Every wall, every corner, ever inch of the house was covered with ramps. And in the back yard he had 2 mini half-pipes. Bam’s mom April loves her garden, so Bam showed his love by planting the 2 ramps on top of the garden. At one point, Bam and Tony Hawk made big-huge gashes on the sealing when going up one of the ramps. It’s funny, Bam’s buddy Brandon picked up Bam’s parents in his “ghetto limousine.” Serious, the roof of the limo was leaking as it rained. When April and Phil got to the house they thought that Bam had thrown so big party cuz there was roughly 40 cars at their house. The went inside to find out what Bam had done. April was freaking out, man! There sure were some good laughs that episode.

      Today I went to see the movie Bad Santa. It was good! I was impressed! Movies like this one show all the funny parts on commercials, but there was funny-ass stuff. After seeing this film, it made me realize why it’s R. Billy Bob Thornton was great! So was the kid in the movie.  Why It’s R - Holly shit, there’s a bunch of dirty crap in this movie. He works at the mall as Santa Claus, goes to work totally drunk, gets pissed on by kids, curses every friggin’ second, has sex in a Nordstrum changing room, steals a BMW, and gets a lady pined up to a pinball machine and proceeds to hump her. Okay, must I go any further?   Acting - Billy Bob Thornton was great! He was THE person to do this film. For the only few films I’ve seen him in, I had nothing bad to say. His a real good actor. As for the kid (who was chubby, talkative, and made fun of) he was good.  It was a sort of a clash. I mean, here’s a drunk loser who dresses as Santa Claus living with a little fat kid who gets on his nerve all of the time. Not to mention Billy Bob’s character hates kids. It was a funny combination.   My Grade - Well, it’s kinda hard to decide, so, I give it ****. It was very good! If you like movies like Old School or Saving Silverman, you’ll like this one! Go and see it while it’s still in theaters!

      Today, I was listening to the Coldplay CD Parachutes. Oh man! There’s this one song called “Parachutes.” It’s one awesome song! The one thing that sucks is that it’s only 48 seconds. You totally wish it was longer because it’s THAT good.   Gee, I guess I’ll just have to listen to every other Coldplay song to forget about it.

      Okay, today my brother and I went to Berkeley to do some Christmas shopping. After going to the bone store we went for lunch at Barney’s. We both got a cheeseburger. When Max finished his burger I was just a couple of good bites away from finishing it, but I was stuffed. After I told him I was full, he leaned over and said, “I’ll give you a buck if you dip your burger in this ranch dressing.” I didn’t back down. Then he said he was gonna dip it in the dressing. Man-oh-man! He drenched that sucker! And lemme tell ya, it was a fat bite! The second he hands it to me I immediately put it in my mouth and eat the ranch dressing drenched burger and was chewing away. After a couple of seconds the taste kicks in. I almost felt like gaggin’ so Max was gonna pay me 2 bucks. Anyways, I finished it and thankfully found a breath mint. As Max and I walked to the car I realized that there are people who actually eat their burgers with ranch dressing.  *Note to self - Never eat a hamburger with an ass-load of ranch dressing.

      Yesterday I went to see the Counting Crows at the Warfield in San Francisco. Oh man it was AWESOME!!!!! The whole friggin’ concert was like taking a 5 year old kid in a candy store!   The First Opening Band - Well, ehhh, didn’t see them. Quite frankly, I didn’t wanna see them. So, uhhh, they might have been a kick-ass band or just plane crap. Who knows?  The Wallflowers - Oh my God! They were real good! We got there just before they started and lemme tell ya, they were fantastic! I never really got into the Wallflowers, don’t know why, but after that concert they sure as hell proved their worthiness to me. Jacob Dylan, whata nice guy. In between songs he’d stop and have a little chat with the crowd. That’s cool. Lemme tell you that he looks and has that voice like his dad, Bob Dylan. Oh yeah, very good drummer. The dude looked just like Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, but it wasn’t.  The Counting Crow - UN FRIGGIN’ BELIEVEABLE!!!!! They’re so damn good it almost scares you! That Adam guy is so cool! The whole concert he was barefoot. And at the beginning of the concert he said, “If we don’t play a long enough set, don’t worry. We’re gonna come out again with a couple of friends. Believe me, the encores will be motherfucker!” Every song was great! They played all their good songs like Mr. Jones, Rain King, and Long December. In fact, when he played Long December on the piano he stopped at like the second or third chorus and said, “I fucked up, lemme try it again.” And to agree with Adam, the encores were motherfucker. For the encore Adam had the Wallflowers and the other band come out and they all played together. It was awesome!   My Grade - The first opening band, well . . . Uhhh N/A. From what I herd they were good, but they may think AFI’s good so, yeah.  The Wallflowers - ****½. They were real good. I may consider buying one of their albums now. The Counting Crows - *****! They were awesome!!! Next time they’re around here I’m gonna see them. You should too.  P.S. - They’re new Best of CD is tight. Ask for it for Christmas. It is the perfect Christmas present to receive my friend.

      Yesterday I went to see the extended edition of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. It was friggin’ unbelievable!!! It was my first time seeing the extended edition and to make things cooler I saw it in theaters at the Imax in Dublin. That’s probably one of my favorite theaters that I’ve been to. Any-hoo, it was awesome, awesome, and guess what . . . AWESOME!!!  The Extras - Excellonty! It’s seeing a extra 15 minutes of a 3 hour movie that puts the mojo in a movie. Some of the extras were kinda not important, but there were some extras that helped you understand some stuff better. After seeing to movie it makes me wanna see all of them straight, y’know? My brother says that the extras in The Two Towers is even better. It’s cool because that same theater is gonna play the extended edition of The Two Towers this week. We might go. I especially wanna see the extended Two Towers before I see The Return of the King just incase if I don’t see the extended Two Towers I’m not gonna be a total doosh-bag and not understand Return of the King.   Grade - Duhhh. The Lord of the Rings - Extended edition - Battles with ugly-ass monsters. Okay, a simple as humanly possible, I give it an ass-kicking *****! Gee, that was easy.

      Last night I went to Barnes & Noble to check out the CDs like I always do. Going in there, I thought of getting either Radiohead's The Bends or OK Computer. Both were there, but then all of a sudden; The Cure! I knew that I needed a Cure album because I didn't have one. So I scrolled through their CDs and found a best of CD called Galore. So I looked at the back, and I read to myself, "Hmmm, Just Like Heaven; nice, ah, Pictures of You; cool, alright, Friday I'm in Love; sweet! So I had to buy it. Unfortunately, Barnes has a reputation for having shitty prices on CDs. I mean that by, this 18 track CD was $20! That’s good money, but what can ya do? After I bought it, I listened to it like 2 times last night, and once this morning. It’s THAT good!  Well, well, well. My grade for an album of this kick-ass status. I’ll have to give it a ****. It’s really good, but I’m not that into The Cure, but my goal was to buy this album and get to like them. I’m sure in the near future, I’d give this album a ****1/2 or even a *****! So if you’re into good 80s rock, that kinda stuff, go to your local record store and pick up a Cure album. Believe me, you won’t be disappointed.

      A couple of days ago I went to Ano Nuevo, which is by Santa Cruz, to check out the elephant seals. Man, its cool! Those seals are amazing! Just picture 2,000 elephant seals creating a blubber platform by the ocean, and you're there! Apparently, this is the breeding season for the elephant seals. Our tour guide was cool as well. He knew so much about these seals; how the live, eat, sleep, ect. I mean, they swim up to Alaska to eat, which takes 30 days, and then come back. Now this is REAL amazing, most elephant seals can swim down over 2,500 feet underwater and stay down there for 2 hours! Pretty cool, eh? The amazing thing is that 100 years ago elephant seals were almost extinct and that they made a tremendous come-back, because, well, 2,000 seals is a lot! Me, I don’t normally go to these kinda things, but if I ever have the chance, I’d definitely go there again. If you’re ever are bored, and interested, check out Ano Nuevo to see the seals.     I'll try putting up a pic of some of the seals today or tomorrow.

      There is a total of 18 cigarette-burners in the theatrical version of The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King. If you don’t know what a cigarette-burn is, every 15 to 20 minutes you’ll se a black circle in the upper right hand corner of the screen. That’s when they change the reel.

      Okay, I bet you all are wondering what I did for New Years Eve. Well, my dad and I went to see The Dead. If you don’t know who The Dead are they are the original members of The Greatful Dead, just without Jerry Garcia. Okay, FRIGGIN’ AWESOME!!!!! It was unbelievable! They rocked! The crowd, the band, the celebration, all cool!  The Crowd - Great! It’s like a traveling circus. Imagine a place where everyone is wearing goofy hats, tidye shirts, smoking pot, and blurting out the most random shit ever; my friend, you’re at The Dead concert. It’s great, everyone there was smoking pot. My dad and I were probably the only people there not smoking dope. In fact, the t-shirt that I bought there smells like pot. I almost feel like not washing it. And during the concert, there was this guy who went around the arena multiple times juggling like 6 glow-up balls. And the crowd is wearing glow sticks around their necks and arms. The people there are all like one big family, except they’re all high.  Robert Hunter - Real good. He played a good hour long set. He came out with this big-white Gibson Classic Reissue guitar, said hello and started. He played some cool songs. None of them I really knew, but Robert Hunter, I think, wrote some songs for The Greatful Dead. Pretty cool, huh? All and all, he was really good.  Motown - Really . . . uh . . . how shall I say it; cool. They’re were actually the back-up band for all the Motown groups like The Supremes, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye. In fact, they have the most hits in the world, even more than The Beatles and Rolling Stones combined! And one of the chicks from the band has around 80 gold records. Amazing, eh? Anyways, they’re all in their 70s and there were 7 of the 16 original members. They’re all black and they wore these red suits. They were very good. They performed great songs like The Supremes’ “Stop in the Name of Love,” Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On,” ect. Totally cool! They set was a good hour and a half long, but it was worth it.   Midnight - After a while the lights went out. Then an amazing light show began. It was like a friggin’ JLo video. Then this hug space ship floated to the stage then back across the arena. At first it seemed lame nothing happened after. Then, all was quiet, until the 10 Count started. As we cleared our throats to say the word "ten" there were these two guys hitting a hug drum for every second. As one was finished, BOOM! The jungle of balloons and confide fell on us. There was probably 2000 balloons. Then The Dead ripped into Sugar Magnolia.    The Dead - ABSOLUTLYUNFRIGGIN’BELIEVABLE!!!!! They were the greatest!!! If there's a concert this year that was the best; it was this one! Again; UNBELIEVABLE!!! We've got finger-rambling guitar of Bob Weir, and the scary-low bass of Phil Lesh that make this concert wonderful. As for the new guitarist, well, not that bad. Y'know, its hard replacing a guy like Jerry Garcia, but this guy did an okay job. But he was a little bit more heavy and loud as Garcia. Still the concert was off-the-friggin'-hook! Right as 12 midnight came they performed Sugar Magnolia. They did a lot of songs I don't recognize, but they didn't play Darkstar. It would have been cool because they've only played Darkstar in concert only like 5 times. It would've been cool though.   My Grade - Totally great bands. Robert Hunter - **** because he did long songs. Plus I didn’t know much about him. That Motown Band - ****1/2 because their performance was a little too long. The Dead - *****! AWESOME. If there’s one show you wanna go to, see The Dead!   P.S. Sorry for the delay.

      Okay, I'm searching for a 1960s Airline guitar like the one used by Jack White of the White Stripes (which is a 1965 model, made of a fiberglass called Res-O-Glas). If you know where I could find one, give me information about it. Here's a picture so you know what it looks like.      I prefer it to be the color on the picture, but I need it to be the same body style. There's an article in this months Rolling Stone talking about it. I'll find a link and put it up. Thanks for the help. Oh yeah, if you can help me there's a link to contact me. Thanks yo!

      Well, well, well another Oscars show. Not too bad. I actually did well on my picks. Out of 24 winners I got 16 right. I mean, it's the best I've done. Sadly, someone in the family, you know who you are, did do so hot and brought in a 15 out of 24. Anyways, to the awards!  Looks like Peter Jackson proved himself, I mean, the dude won best picture with "The Return of the King." Oh, and I chose that. I mean, c'mon, everyone knew this was Jackson's year. Now that I look at it, he forked in a couple awards. Well, I must say myself, Return of the King ruled! And today shows that it really did. Anyways, Peter Jackson, rock on!  Other awards went to crappy people. Sadly, Sean Penn got a couple awards. I don't know, Sean Penn bothers me. But I gotta admit, "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" was a classic! But still, I didn't see "Mystic River." In fact, I didn't see "Lost in Translation." I wanna see that one. All and all, some awards were given to annoying and crappy actors or actresses such as Sean Penn and Renee Zellweger.   The performances were okay. I mean, you never really expect epic performances at the Oscars. But Jack Black and Will Farrell were funny. They sang a song talking about the background music when they film people that loose an award as the winner accepts it. And they were singing about how they play that music because the losers are boring. Still, it was funny. Oh lemme tell you something even more funny. Sean Connery. I mean, the guys voice almost seems like he does it on purpose. Like instead of "movies" he says "movesh" with a heavy Scottish accent. I just love reacting Sean Connery on the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy thing. It’s so much fun! “I’m the cock of the walk!” and “Surprise me you filthy bastard!” It’s funny as hell!  Well, this Oscars show wasn’t too bad. Once again, I’ll leave the clothing and red carpet stuff to Joan Rivers. Hehe. Okay, hope you enjoyed it, and well, hope you weren’t disappointed when “Brother Bear.” I know I wasn’t. Oh, as a “Part II” to my Oscars post, I’ll be posting a VERY important picture tomorrow hopefully. Be sure to check it out. See ya then.

      If you know me, you know I love rock n roll. Y'know, The White Stripes, Radiohead, Cake. So for me it's important to have a good radio station that plays the stuff that I like. That's why I've been a long time listener of Live 105. They play all rock n roll stuff, so I can easily say I like them.  Here's my story. In the past couple of years, as rap and newer rock bands came to be the radio stations changed, including Live 105. Last year, they really crapped out on me. They played bands like Blink 182 and Good Charlotte, regularly. That’s what really pissed me off. But, then, a miracle happened. This year the owner of Live 105 said that last year, 2003, they experimented by playing newer stuff. And they realized that there was less listeners. So he decided that Live 105 should go back to the roots of rock n roll by playing classic alternative and punk stuff like Nirvana and Social Distortion. I was like, “Right on!!!” I mean, they’ll be playing The Ramones on my way to guitar lessons. How cool is that?  And this is cool. This morning, I was listening to Howard Stern on Live 105. Around 10 A.M. when it was over they started playing music. The first couple of songs they played ruled! They were playing stuff like Nirvana’s “All Apologies,” Verve Pipe’s “Bittersweet Symphony,” and even Temple of the Dog’s “Hunger Strike.” How friggin’ cool is that?!   I gotta tell ya, Live 105 has changed. And this time, change is GOOD, VERRY GOOD! Well, if you live in the Bay Area listen to Live 105 if you like the same music as I do. Especially if you hate all those crappy bands. Thank YOU Live 105 for realizing how much better you’re doing now that you play to good stuff.

      Today, I went with some buddies of mine to see 50 First Dates. What can I say; wasn't too bad. Almost every movie Adam Sandler is in gets bad reviews, but I always like it. That's kinda how I feel about the Austin Powers movies. Back to 50 First Dates. Adam Sandler was funny. Drew Barrymore was, uh, Drew Barrymore. And of course, Adam Sandler brought in a couple of actors that have been in ALL of his movies.   Okay, something I noticed about this movie was, it was a bit too long. I mean, it is kinda one of those movies, that is good, but runs a little too long. Still, I liked it. Adam Sandler did a good job. I was ready to have a good laugh when they got to the scene when he gets out his acoustic guitar to sing to Lucy (Drew Barrymore). Like all of his guitar songs, it was funny. He got to one riff that goes like, "Lucy broke her head, just like Gary Busey did." I thought that was harsh, but funny.  WOW! I was surprised with the music. They had some damn-good stuff! They had some Bob Marley and stuff like that. In fact, this morning the only thing on TV was TRL, which I friggin' hate! Adam Sandler was there and he talked about how for the soundtrack there's some newer bands doing old/80s songs. I thought that was cool. Hell, I might go and buy the soundtrack to this movie.  I noticed that Adam Sandler uses stuff from his older movies in this one. Like there's a golf scene when they're golfing and they get a running start, just like in Happy Gilmore. And when he's pissed-off he screamed, "You sick! You sick son-of-a-bitch! How could you do that to me?! Like in Mr. Deeds. Pretty cool, eh?  Grade - Well, I gotta do it. The movie was good. I'm gonna give it a ***1/2. It was good, but not great. It wasn't Adam Sandler's BEST film. But still, if your desperate for a good laugh on Valentines Day, see 50 First Dates. You'll like it, I know I did.  By the way, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY to all Suburban Myths fans!!!

      Okay, you and I know that The Strokes rock! They play them all the time on the radio, stuff like that. I noticed that the first song radio stations play off a new album is one you could really point out. Ever since The Strokes came out with Room on Fire radio stations have been playing the song 12:51, A LOT! I mean, don't get me wrong, I really like that song. But one of those songs like I mentioned that you can point out is the second song on that album called "Reptilia." Now that's a DAMN good Strokes song. I hate that no radio stations play it, especially since 12:51 is getting kinda annoying.   So, if there's any DJs reading this, play the second single off of Room on Fire. Everyone will like it. And for everyone else who just listens to music, go and pick up the new Strokes album.

      Today's been one of those days, y'know. The day you look back at movies you saw or your past girlfriends or looking back at concerts you went to. For me, it's one of those days when I look back at my CD collection. I have a lot of CDs and there's too many to even think about.   This afternoon, I sat here, just looking at all of the CDs I've got. I mean, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, "Man, that Rage Against the Machine CD was awesome!" or "Wow, I remember when I first herd Beck's Sea Changes I didn't like it, but now I love it!" And stuff like that. And then again, I looked back at my shitty CDs, "Oh, Staind, OH GOD!" Or "Hoobastank, must have been high while buying that one!"   Well, I'm gonna continue my search for good CDs, while I do that, I'll search for good songs, such as Patti Smith's "Rock n Roll Nigger."   This post is dedicated to someone, you know who you are.

      Another Grammys. Well, every year I never really expect any spectacular stuff to happen,, but this year was different. Okay, there are some great moments, for example, last years performance; the tribute to Joe Strummer were Dave Grohl, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Van Zandt performed "London Calling" in honor of Joe Strummer. That my friend was amazing. But this year had an EPIC performance! That band would be the one and the only White Stripes. My-friggin'-god, it was ABSO-FRIGGIN'-LUTELY-EPIC. I  almost PISSED myself I was so excited. I mean, I sat there in awe as The White Stripes opened with the first half of Seven Nation Army, then into a couple of riffs of Death Letter, and THEN into some finger-bleeding solos which sounded like they were from the heavy-solo voltage song Ball and Biscuit. Jack White is amazing! He was tearing it APART! After the performance the crowd was giving a standing applause! And of course, my man Quentin Tarantino was in amazement! I'm sorry, I gotta calm down about this performance. If you can, check it out, you'll love it.  Prince, Prince, Prince, Prince, Prince; not too good. Hey, don't get me wrong, Prince rules, but this performance didn't do the job. My first thoughts when I herd Prince was gonna perform was, "Hey, maybe Foo Fighters will do Darling Nikki with him,"  but they didn't. Would have been damn cool, though. He did Purple Rain with Beyonce. He did great guitar, but it still was good.  The Beatles tribute was okay. Half the people performing the song _ , I hated. But it was good. Not much to talk about for it. But no tribute could compare to last years tribute to the late Joe Strummer. Still, I liked it.   Okay, the awards; a whole lot of bad winners and some good. I was glad Coldplay won something like Song of the Year for "Clocks." But I apologize. I wasn't really watching the awards part. I was bummed The White Stripes didn't win Album of the Year for "Elephant." I was SO pissed, 10 minutes before the Grammys I went on Yahoo, and saw in bold, "OUTKAST WINS ALBUM OF THE YEAR!" I was real pissed! Oh well, I kinda like them. Other than that it was good.  Outkast; well, well, well. Their performance was cool! I'm not really into rap, but I do like Run DMC and Beastie Boys, but I like the song "Hey Ya!" They did that and had like the USC or some college band come out on stage to perform. It was good.  Sorry, I'm not commenting on the clothing. I ain't Joan River, hehe. Anyways, the Grammys wasn't too much of a disappointment, but I hope next year will be a little better.

You've been the best big brother anyone could ask for. Whether we were making fun of band bands of movies or you explaining the greatness of The Beatles to me, you've been great! Hope your b'day is full of happiness, especially with your new 51" Sony HD TV. Have a good one, man!   And everyone from Suburban Myths, we say, "Happy birthday, Max!"

      Well, well, well. It looks like we've got another 6 weeks of winter to look forward to. Thanks to Punxsutawney Phil, for making the final dissection  if we’ll have another 6 weeks of winter or have spring arrive soon, he’s decided to put all us East Bay-ers in hell by giving us another 6 weeks of cold, wet, and depressing  weather. Too bad. Hopefully the damn thing will be wrong, and we won’t have to rely on a groundhog as our forecaster. Oh well. But there’s one thing I just realized today about Groundhogs Day. I always forget it. I mean, I’m able to remember when it’s Boxing Day, and not Groundhogs Day. Sadly, I didn’t realize it was Groundhogs day until 2. Very sad. Well, I hope my Groundhogs Day will be as half as good as yours will be.   Since it’s Groundhogs Day, I’ll try to make the effort of watching the Bill Murray movie “Groundhogs Day.” Maybe that will brighten my day.

      Today I went with my friend to see the movie "Starsky and Hutch." Boy oh boy, that movie was funny! Oh man, I really wish that Ben Stiller would make more movies like this, not movies where he plays the boyfriend like in "Meet the Parents," "Along Came Polly," and "There's Something About Mary." Well, "There's Something About Mary" was funny, but still, he does a good job in movies like this one.  Okay, first off I gotta tip my hat off for the good job this movie did. They made it look like a real 70s cop TV show, y'know, good guy comes out of nowhere and the camera zooms in fast and having a muscle-type car. You get where I'm going. I mean, just so good. I really gotta tip my hat off for that damn good job.  This movie was VERY funny. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. For me there were two FUNNIEST scenes. One was with Will Farrell. That's when Will Farrell has to give Starsky and Hutch information about a coke-dealer and he has them do funny stuff before spilling the beans. Like, at one point he has Owen Wilson's character bend over and make a "dragon face." Oh my friggin' god, at one point he has Starsky and Hutch on each other with the dragon look or mad look. Oh god, it was HALLARIOUS! But this part was my favorite; on the job they have what was said to be fake-cocaine. So when they have these two chicks over Ben Stiller's character make coffee and they're out of sugar, so they use the fake-coke. And Ben Stiller starts drinking the coffee only to realize it was REAL cocaine. I mean, I saw it from a mile away, my friend. Then he comes out, high with huge pupils and bloodshot eyes and is like freaking out. Oh my god it was so funny I was laughing so hard I felt like puking! Very funny stuff!  Well, I don’t wanna give it all away, but near the end they lose their Ford Torino and then they get the same one given by the real guys from the original show Starsky and Hutch. Very cool. I mean, this happened because Ben Stiller’s character was so attached to that Ford. So the original Starsky and Hutch give them theirs. Very cool.  This movie was great. It was definitely worth my money. You gotta see this one. If you liked “Old School,” or a movie like that, you’ll LOVE Starsky and Hutch. I can easily give it **** out of ***** stars. Well, enjoy it while it’s still out. I’ll keep ya posted.   By the way, Snopp Dog playing Huggy Bear, he was great! He’s so cool. He did a good job too.

It is friggin' hot here in Concord! For the past week or so its been like 85 degrees outside. I mean, we went from February Freezing-Ass Temperatures to Out of Nowhere Heat in the middle of March. It's almost hard to imagine. Lemme tell you, spring has started out of nowhere!  Well, as the heat kicks in I have my routine of staying cool. Well, I don't have to try; I'm already cool! Hehe.

      OH MY FUCKING GOD! This movie was, I can't even describe it without yelling out loud! I'm telling you, this movie has been the best, and I mean, THE BEST, movie I've seen in a while. Un-friggin'-believable! Uma + Quentin + Daryl Hannon = BEST MOVIE!!! Okay, lemme get to the point when I tell you about it.   The Directing - The absolute obvious; QT pulls it off! I'm telling you, ever little angle and distance of blood-spattering, ass-kicking, and eye-gouging was perfect. No one, I mean, NO ONE, does it like my man QT.   Dialog - Good but not great. It was better than Vol. 1. But wasn’t QT’s best dialog, c’mon, PULP FICTION, nothing beats it! I mean, that movie has classic quotes like “Now, now, lets not be sucking each others dicks quite yet.” I’m proved it with that one quote. Back to Kill Bill. So, to make it simple and easy, this one had good dialog.   Casting - Amazing. Uma kicked-ass! Darryl Hannon kick-ass AND got her ass-kicked in the process. And Bill, oh man, bad ass! And of course, Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus, Rufus is the man! None the less, great cast.   Battle Scenes - Lemme just say, as I sat back watching them, I was in awe, I couldn’t breath. I was shaking as I sipped on a Cherry Coke watching the amazing fights! Because I’m nice by not telling you a lot about the battles, the one with Uma Thurman and Darryl Hannon was bitchin’!!! Sweet jesus take me now! I was amazed. Just to give you all a small portion of the best battle in the move, it consists of EYE-GOUGING!!! How unbelievably cool is that, my friend?! Well, I wish I could tell you more, but I don’t wanna spoil it.   My Grade - Easier than wiggling my big-toe; I give it 5 out of 5 stars! Okay, maybe I’d settle better with a 4 1/2 stars better than 5, but still, this movie kick-ass!!!  I’m telling you, go sit your ass in front row and see this movie, because you ain’t gonna see Terantino perfect another kung-fu movie like this! Unless, oh man, do I hear a Vol. 3 in my head?! Well just have to wait and see.  MY TO-DO LIST: KILL BILL!

      Just got back from seeing Hellboy. Boy, lemme tell ya, it was great. I mean, and my brother and I agree that any movie with tentacle-covered hell-hounds, such as Hellboy, kick-ass! And it’s a hug plus with the Nazis. C’mon, doesn’t that make a good movie? Alright, before the previews when we were sitting down, my brother and I somehow started talking about DMX’s song “X Gonna Give It to Ya.” I know, I don’t know why either, hehe. And at one point we talked about DMX on a Behind the Music type thing and they ask him “How did you write a song as beautiful as this, ‘X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya, X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya . . . ’” Funny shit, my friend. Okay back to Hellboy.  The movie was great. The guy who played Hellboy was great. Very funny, too! I really liked it. I mean, not much to say about the characters, but one character, “Kroenen,” this nonhuman-Nazi-who will kick your ass with style, was bitchin’! He was just, AWESOME! I mean, for a fake human/Nazi leader, he was pretty cool, hehe.  Well, I’m getting tired, may hit the sac. Anyways go see Hellboy. I mean, if you liked The Hulk, or Spider-Man, y’know, those movies, you’ll love Hellboy.   Remember to set your clocks 1 hour forward.

      Alright, yesterday on VH1 they had an hour of Led Zeppelin live at Madison Square Garden in '73. Great show! Even better on the high-def TV! You could literally see the sweat dripping down Jimmy Page's face as he blows away the crowd with thundering-solos! Anyways, when they play the song "Whole Lotta Love" they had a 4 minute shot of Plant’s crotch! This was annoying; while I’m trying to enjoy Zeppelin I’m forced to see a lot of Plant-crotch.   Zeppelin lives on!

      Just a couple of days ago, our baby arrived! That's right, a 47 inch-Sony-wide screen-high def-TV!!! Oh my god! If you can imagine being in Hawaii, at the beach, watching a beautiful sunset, with a Pina Colada in your hand, and feel the ocean water hit your face, THAT’S what it’s like watching this TV! By the way, Sony should be the only company allowed to use the word “TV.” They’re the best!   Anyways, this TV is great. Right after we got it, we then got a High Def box. Boy, lemme tell ya, you ain’t gonna seen the A’s beet the Red Sox 15 to 2 like WE did with the HD! And the sound is so friggin’ booming! We don’t even have surround-sound and yet it sounds as if you’re there! Very, VERY, awesome!  Now, I’ve got a long list of movies to watch on this bad-S.O.B.! I’ll come up with a list later, but I’ll tell you now that I watch the last 10 minutes of Scarface on it! I know; AWESOME!!!  Well, my advise to you: “If you EVER plan on getting a new TV (preferably a 50 inch-wide screen), get a Sony. You’ll get your moneys-worth!”

      Okay, terrorism has been an issue in the US for a while now, which is something I chose not to follow mainly cuz I'm a lazy-ass and I don't care for all this shit. Anyways, it hit me; now terrorist are coming to America with their family to disguise themselves. That’s where it got me; are we terrorists? Hmmm . . . I don’t know. We’re suspicious, that’s a FACT! Here’s us; small family of four (starting to wonder) - moves from Concord to ORINDA! (Hmmm, concerned-rate rises) - and live by the Lafayette Reservoir and 1 million gallon water-tower (disaster could happen in a second)! Makes me wonder. Am I a treat to the USA? Well no, I’d be a pussy when it comes to terrorist-shit like that! But still, when government goes through the records, are they gonna stop and say “Wow, Bill! Look at these people. They went from Concord to Orinda, small family, and live by a 1 million gallon-holding water-tower!” Will it be my ass getting cuffed and thrown into a police truck? Well, probably not. But how do you know?

      Summer is approaching, that means I must start a list of things to do! So, I've constructed a list of things to do to make this summer ultimate!  MUSIC - I'm gonna play lots of guitar! I'll hopefully get a band together, too (if I'm lucky). I already play guitar, write my own songs with words and music, and make demo tapes in my bedroom. I have at least 10 different demos ready for people to play or even PEOPLE TO BUY!!! Okay, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but still, hopefully I'll get a band together.  I also hope to listen to some good tunes. I'm looking forward to Cake's new album due-out in August. And other good albums like Dead Kennedys "Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death" and Nirvana "In Utero" I will probably listen to over and over again! I'll just wait and see.  MOVIES - Many good movies coming out this summer. I'll make up a list later. But, I'll be at the movies non-stop.   PLACES TO GO - Maybe we'll make a trip up to Tahoe for a week. If so, that'll be a good way to spend a part of my summer.  Okay, this list may seem dinky, but I'll come up with more. For now, I'll continue planning.   Later.

      Okay, lemme tell ya. I hate Fridays! Okay, well, I love the fact that the weekend is finally arrived, but it sucks because while EVERYONE I know is at the movies, or doing some other shit I'M stuck playing my guitar and writing lyrics about everything in the world. Well, all and all, Fridays suck for me!  I hope your Friday doesn't suck as much as mine. Later.

      Don't we all at SOME point get a song stuck in our head, good or bad? Unfortunately, thanks to my cold-hearted friend Trevor, he got the Presidents of the United States of America song "Peaches" stuck in my head. Now don't get me wrong, I love PUSA, and songs like "Lump" and "Kick Out the Jams," but this song Peaches is SO FRIGGIN' ADDICTING! For about 4 or 5 days now I've been thinking about it like nuts! I mean, how cool is this song. I mean, take a song about fruits and IT'S GOOD! That's hard, my friend, but they made it happen! So all's I gotta say is, go to the country and get yourself some peaches.  Keep it fo-shizzle like Bobby D-izzle!

      Okay, I know I'm a geek to watch Survivor religiously, but you won't catch me eating rice and snaking on bugs, y'know. Anyways, I'll get to the finally.  Okay, before a new season starts I try to pick who will end up winning. Me, I always pick the person who gets two inches from winning! I'm like god damn Phil Mickelson! I was going to chose Lex, but I felt like I should pick Jenna. Jenna was good because she didn’t impress anyone too much, win any immunities, or hold any grudges.   First Hour:  Big Tom goes out, owch! Three words; DON’T TRUST ROB! C’mon man! Sad enough, the goat-farmer got stuck in Rob’s trap!   Rupert’s next to go! Jenna turns on him which was a GOOD MOVE! If anyone, I mean ANYONE, got to the final two with Rupert, duh! He’d win! Even though Jenna’s decision was kinda harsh, it was smart!	  Now, the two dudes you wouldn’t wanna piss off (Tom and Rupert) are in the jury PISSED!   Second Hour:  Final three: Jenna, Amber, and Boston Rob. Of course, the final challenge is one of those “be in an uncomfortable position-stand there forever-hot as fucking hell . . . ” You get it. Of course, to make this challenge more of a pain in the ass, it was something like 110 degrees! Okay, Jenna’s the first to wimp out, well, she just made a sad mistake. See, you have to hold on this post and stand on two posts with your feet. If anything comes off, you’re out! Jenna took one of her feet off the post and ended up costing her a million bucks! And then Rob won. Whoopdee-fucking-doo! Oh well.  Tribal Council, of course, Rob picked Amber to go to the final two with him leaving Jenna in the jury. It was like the movie Titanic (don’t ask why); you know the ships gonna sink! It was the same with this! Alright, once again, my pick is SO close, but not close enough. Story of my life.  Now that the final two are chosen, you gotta sit through a 45 minute .”devotion to people you voted off” thing. I mean, you think they’re gonna say, “Oh, I miss this person, they were a good player . . . ” No way! They should be saying, “This person’s a lying piece of shit, no good, crappy player . . . ” I mean, YOU VOTED THE LOSER OFF! Oh well!   Okay, now the votes! Here’s the part where people get to speak their mind and say “fuck you” with a straight face. Best part of this was Big Tom! First he opens up by saying to Rob and Amber “I’m a goat-farmer, so if I see a goat chasin’ little-old ladies, I CASTRATE THEM!” Already I’m pissing myself from laughing! And at the end he goes “ . . . Anyways, no hard feelings . . . ” and walks up to Rob to shake hands, but pulls it away and says, “ . . . Don’t be stupid, stupid!” That was PRICELESS!!! Oh, and I love how Jerri wanted to speak, but everyone booed her! HAHA! And after the break the host said that she left because of the rude crowd. How sad, ***cough**cough***.   The votes! Okay, but first; the twist! Okay, too fucking obvious! Rob ended up proposing to Amber, and she said "yes." At this point I HATE THIS SHOW! HAHA! JENNA LOOSES! ROB AND AMBER IN FINAL TWO! THEY GET MARRIED! AHHH!!! (haha!) Anyways, I had a good feeling Rob would win because, he’s played good! He’s a smart player! You gotta admit!  He is!  But, Amber won buy like 1 votes. Who cares, he’s gonna get the money anyways!        Okay, now for the "surprise ending" as they called it. At this point, I've sat through 3 hours of Survivor, okay, I enjoyed it, but, okay. After the commercial after the winner gets picked, there's this surprise. As it turned out, you can go online and choose who you want to receive an extra million bucks to give away to any Survivor All Star. I'm thinking "this sucks, man!" Oh well, it was still cool. I mean, c'mon, who do YOU thinks gonna win?! RUPERT! Even I'd vote for him, but I hope that doesn't sound harsh, I do like the guy! He's a great player! Anyways, that's that.   This was a good finally. We have a Survivor couple and plenty of people finding love, even Hatch! WOW! HAHA! Okay, this was a great finally, I can't wait until next season. I'll keep y'all posted then.  Sorry for all these delays because I moved, which I'll write about. I'll keep you posted.   Words of Wisdom from Big Tom: "Don't be stupid, stupid!"

      Okay, I'm really into music and music is my whole life! And every once in a while I'll get into a band like nuts. For example: One month I'll listen to nothing but Radiohead, two months I'll listen to nothing but Bob Dylan, ect. Anyways, lately I've been listening to Nirvana like nuts! Every since Kurt Cobain's 10 Anniversary I've listened to them so friggin' much! Like, the other day, I listened to In Utero at least 4 times straight! Holy shit! Even as I write this post, I'M LISTENING TO NIRVANA!!! My god, is this some sign. Is it a sign from the grave of Cobain? Is my life gonna end? Will Ben Affleck and JLo EVER do a good movie? I better go and, uh, listen to Nirvana??? Hehe!  Tomorrow, I'll be sure to have a post about this weeks Viva La Bam episode   urlLink here  . Be sure and check it out. Later.

      Tonight, I thought about "bands that haven't lost their touch." So here's a couple of them. Hopefully I'll have more on the way.    Foo Fighters - C'mon, all their albums rule! You gotta love "The Colour and the Shape" through "One by One."  Nirvana - For the 5 years they were around, kick-ass! Even 8 years after the end of Nirvana, they continued kicking ass with the release of "You Know You're Right."   R.E.M. - Never lost the touch. Even their new stuff is good. "Orange Crush" and "Imitation of Life" are good songs. You gotta like their old and new stuff.  U2 - Alright, Bono, the Edge, the are so cool; cool as in Pacino in Scarface, Uma in Kill Bill. All their stuff rocks! Even their tours have gotten BETTER! I like to compare U2 to a bottle of wine; the get better as they age.  The White Stripes - Okay, only 4 albums, but, 4 albums that kicked ass!!! Okay, their one of few bands I see a good future to. We'll just have to wait and see.   If you have any bands that haven't lost their touch, feel free to e-mail me. Don't gimme some shitty band though, hehe. Alright, I'll keep you posted.   Dedicated to Kelby.

      On Sunday, my dad and I drove to Marysville to see the Dead (the Grateful Dead's remaining members) only to go to a show that would become the greatest show I've been to!   To start off, it was tough having to go to Marysville. One, it was a long drive; a little over two-hours and two it was hot; 98 degrees when we got there/82 degrees when we left at midnight. But it was worth it!   Okay, we get there. In the parking lot, it's a nirvana of pot smokers, food stands, and merchandise stands. Lemme tell you, when we were snooping around the parking lot, seeing everyone’s shit, there was this dude selling tacos. Boy-o-boy, I was so close to buying one, but I was afraid I was going to get more than just a taco, ya know what I mean? I didn’t wanna get high off of a taco. But all and all, its like one big family, but a family of rock n roll/in trouble with the law/pot-heads/die-hard-fans.   As we entered the Sleep Train Amphitheatre you felt the music, the vibe, the pot. We arrived after Robert Hunter finished his opening set. We sat down in the hot summer sun fighting to get the last sip of my soda. Then, just as the sun went below the lawn behind us, there they were. Here came Bob Weir with his shorts and sandals, Phil Lesh with his famous red, white, and blue wrist-band on, and the rest.   The first act was special. Opening with some of their later songs. It was so refreshing to hear their music and have fun. Some songs of the first set were “Playing With the Band” and covered Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic” (which truly was a highlight of the show). They continued jamming, each member getting their own time to shine in a magnificent way.   Between acts was next. My dad and I traded thoughts of the first act and what we hope to hear. We were in for a definite good show coming next!  The second act truly was “the show.” A lot more electric, loud, fun, and recognizable. They quickly rolled into other great songs. Also, they drove into some more great covers, doing songs like “After Midnight” and the one of Dead’s newest lead-guitarists let into Led Zeppelin’s “Over the Hills and Far Away” (which proved to be the best 6 minutes of the night). Many more songs were played in the warm night sky.   Deciding the beat the traffic home, we left 70 minutes into the second act. So we got out of our seats and we gazed at the stage as we left our seats to head to our car. As we drove out of the parking lot we heard two things; the gravel being kicked up under the tires and the Dead zooming into the magical song “Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion).” As we continued to drive the song came to a halt and we could shortly hear the crowd shouting for more.   Now that I think back, this was a great show! The best concert I’ve ever been to! I don’t even know where to start, but I hope that you get the chance to see them live because they know how to rock out! I give this show 12/10 stars! An extra two because it was THAT great!!!   I was really, really when I found out that they played the song “Dark Star” the previous day. Oh well, I’ll see ‘em again!

      Yesterday I saw newest  urlLink Michael Moore  flick "Fahrenheit 9/11." I loved Bowling for Columbine, so I was eager to see his newest piece!   Great movie, Michael Moore is truly a genius with his writing and ideas. He did a great job of explaining all sorts of political stuff (which helped because I left the theater knowing SO much about all this shit that's been going on) and I can easily say he did a great job of making Bush look bad and his regime. I wish could see the look on Bushes face when he sees this film. I mean, there’s SO much that I wanna talk about this film, but I really don’t wanna spoil it for you, so drop off a comment if ya have any feedback on the movie or your thoughts!   Go see the movie! You’ll love it! If you’re anti-Bush I shouldn’t need to tell you to see it, because I know I am!   Vote Michael Moore 2004!

      One of my favorite songs on the radio is the Modest Mouse song called "Float On." If you haven't heard it, you gotta! It's cool shit.  Anyway, on their website I discovered that they'll be playing in Chico on 7/16. Dude, I hella wanna go to that show. I don't care if I don't even own the friggin' album (that will change when I make my next trip to Tower); it doesn't mean I don't wanna see them! I really hope to see them! I'll be sure to tell you if I do.  You gonna go to any good shows, tell me.

      Lately, I've seen a lot of those "100 Greatest, blah-blah-blah" type shows. And lately, I haven't been very satisfied with any of them! I could easily say Rolling Stone magazine is one of them. I agree with my brother when he says Rolling Stone comes out with a Collectors Issue with countdown shit every month! That always bugs me, because most of them really suck! The two the rubbed me the wrong way the most was 500 Greatest Albums; there's probably only 100 great albums out there! And then their latest Greatest Moments That Changed Rock & Roll. That suck ass! Mainly because on the cover they show a picture of Eminem. He isn't even remotely close to be called a rocker! But anyways, you get the point. And then there's Comedy Centrals Mouthing Off: 51 Greatest Smartasses. I mean, half the people on it were either animated cartoon characters or fictional TV characters. And it was stupid as hell when they had Bill Murray at number one instead of someone like Denis Leary (who got like the 20 spot). How much bullshit can I take with this kind of stuff?! And the something-countdown of the Greatest TV Shows on E! It was okay, I knew that Seinfeld would win, which it did. Some shows I agreed with the spot. I thought they said it was a "Shows We Wish Were Back On," but they had the Simpsons and Will & Grace (sadly on there). Oh well.  Drop off a comment of your favorite stupid countdown.

      Well, it's been a year. Wow, it seems like yesterday I just typed out my first post of this site!   One year ago I was a young man, confused, and searching for ways to take my worthless time and turn it into enjoyment for others. That's when I found the program Blogger. Well, actually, my brother helped me with it and soon enough I was writing about my day-to-day life. Now that it's been a year, things have changed! I've become an adult, more understanding of the world, and a good reason to be on the computer for a good while each day! I know this sounds real cheesy, but it sounds good, ha-ha!    As an extra, I'm going to write about the celebration I had! I'll try to have it up A.S.A.P.!   Now, I have to give my thanks. I'd like to thank Max Gerry for starting my blog and helping me create a whole new revolution with my writing. And well, um, I guess that's it. WAIT, of course, I must thank all of you, the fans, for going on my website. Without you all, I wouldn't be at ALL motivated to keep this site running, and for that, I thank you. I hope that as time goes on, you will still visit and enjoy my site as much as I like running it!  Thanks to all, and have a good night!

      Yesterday, I wen't to my brothers house. Got pizza, hung out, and watched a good movie; BASEketball. What a funny movie! It's still funny, even for my 100th time seeing it! If you haven't seen it, watch it, especially if you have On Demand FREE from Comcast (which we used)! It's great! They have tons of movies for free and you can pause, rewind, and fastforward, like TeVo!  It goes the same with music! We watched this video of Joe Strummer of the Clash doing "Redemption Songs" acoustically! So amazing! But in the video it shows people like the dudes from Rancid and just fans of Strummer and the Clash holding a big candle vigil for him. It's so moving; I almost cried.   Well, here's what to do this summer! Visit your peeps, order food, and watch movies and music videos! Enjoy your summer!  Feel free to leave me a comment on what you've done this summer!

      100 to 87; PISTONS!!! Hell yeah, man! What a game, what a win!  First off, I hate the Lakers, so whoever's in the finals with the Lakers, I'm with them for the game! Pistons just beat the shit out of the Lakers! I mean, the Lakers made SO many mistakes I don't even know where to start! They did so shitty with their shooting, defense, free-throw shots, and everything! They didn’t know what the fuck they were doing! I mean, no one, and I mean NO ONE, was sinking their FT’s and the Lakers NEEDED those 3-pointers, but they weren’t shooting them!!! I mean, c’mon, a bunch of retards on acid with their eyes shut could have beat the Lakers! Yes, it was THAT bad!   Well, hope you enjoyed watching the Lakers go through a good whoopin’! I know I did!   And wouldn’t it be cool if the White Stripes performed?!

      Lately, I've been listening to the Verve album "Urban Hymns." It's really good! It's the best Verve you'll find for a short-lived/three-album band! It's got their best! You've probably herd "Bittersweet Symphony" and "Sonnet." It's real good! But this song "The Rolling People" sound JUST like a Radiohead song it's unbelievable! All and all, good stuff!  Well, if ya like stuff like Radiohead and U2, you'll definitely like The Verve! Go pick up Urban Hymns, it's probably in the $8 section cuz it's kinda old. Go get it!

      There are so many good sayings you can use through awesome movies, here are some of them.  Boss: I'm not happy with your work lately. You: You want a fucking war?! I'll give you a war!  Teacher: Which one of these papers is yours? You: The one that says "Bad Mother Fucker" on it.  Preacher: What's your favorite bible entry? You: Ezekiel 25:17, the path of the righteous man . . .   Boss: I’m sorry, but I’ll have to fire you. You: You dick!  Your Local McDonalds Employee: And what would you like today, sir? You: How about a, “Royale With Cheese.”  So, next time you get the chance, you a smooth-line from Pulp Fiction or a death-threat-like line from Scarface! Believe me, they work, I just proved it!

      Just watch the preview for the new movie  urlLink "Lords of Dogtown . Looks very cool! I guess if you saw the doc that they did of Dogtown and Z-Boyz, than it's just like this, except there's actual actors in it! So it sounds good.  One thing about the preview that got me was it didn't seem like "acting" type of a movie; it looked more of a doc of a dude who made skateboards back in the day/a craftsman show. Well, I've only seen the preview once, so maybe it's more, y'know, than I thought!  I'll see ya'll there when it's out!   In memory of my big-dawg  Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) .

      Man, just got back from seeing one of the best rock-docs I've ever seen. It's Festival Express. It's basically bands from the 60s and 70s such as Grateful Dead, the Band, Janis Jop, and others that went on a tour through Canada by train during the summer or 1970. And for 30 years since the shows, tapes and footage got lost, but recently was found and made into a movie. And a damn good one!  You gotta catch this one, man. It's hard to explain how good it was, but it made me go to my garage, and blow the roof off with guitar-solos ALL NIGHT! So, hope you feel that way too.

      I'm very "out of it" today. I have these days a lot. So for this post, I wanna share with you some random facts I've picked up over the years:  The word "Typewriter" is the longest word you can write it with one row on a keyboard.  Meg White of the White Stripes doesn't enjoy wearing white or red aside from playing shows.  In 5-card poker, the odds of getting a "Royal Flush" are 1 to 649,740.  Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon was with his left foot.  Guitarist; Jimi Hendrix would hid LSD underneath a head-bandana, so the LSD would hit his bloodstream faster going through his pours.  E=MC2  Okay, I'm getting bored with this, and I'm sure you are. I'll have some more stuff up later today.  Keep on checking back here. I'm almost at 200-hits this month! I'm cutting close.

      Last week I bought the newest  urlLink Wilco  album  A Ghost Is Born . I mean, I loved their previous album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002) and plus it's been getting great reviews.   Very good album. For me, I love Wilco. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was like that first breath of sweet air as you come up from underwater for me. But this new album, was, well, different. I mean, at first I was trying to decide if it was good or just unlistenable. I mean, the songs are longer, no choruses, ect. They all start off acoutical and quiet and then towards the end it's just a big jam of electric guitar and piano. I'll be honest, it took me a couple times of listening to the album to realize that I  really  enjoy it. But I still can't figure out my favorite song. Either "The Late Greats" or "Spiders (Kidsmoke)," which is a 10-minute guitar-riff jam that turns back into a simply but hypnotizing beat that stays in your mind all day!    Make sure you go and buy it. You'll love it! But believe me, you'll have to listen to it at least 3 times, song to song, to really live it!  Night-night! Keep ya butt tight!

      I just visited  urlLink Cake's website  and they've posted a picture of the new album called "Pressure Chief." Unfortunately, the new album will be pused back a month, so it's release date is October 5th. I'm also glad to hear that they'll be seting up downloadable previews of their newest songs and that they'll probably be making a stop in the Bay Area.  Well, well, well. I know you've been eager to see an image of the newest Cake album. Click  urlLink here  too see it.  See ya.

      One TV commercial that I've wondered about was the Dairy Queen commercial for their new latte-frappuccino. First off, I didn’t even know that DQ was still around! I mean, I haven’t seen one of them in years!   Okay, the scene is that they have a middle-age woman (who’s blind folded) try your average frappuccino and the  new  DQ frappuccino. My first thought is, how many adults go to Dairy Queen for lunch? I mean, they always advertise kids meals and ice creams only a small child would enjoy. Then, once she finishes the first drink she tries the DQ drink. Than says “Mmm, I chose this one!” Then the two men recording her thoughts say “Okay, give me it.” And then the woman profusely drinks the latte frap and blocks the mans reach with her arm. Now I’m thinking “Why do they want the frappuccino back?!” And two “Is the frappuccino filled with drugs or high caffeine amounts, I mean, she began to get violent with the man and then continued to run into a door.” If it did this single .99 cent drink of this sort did this much damage to a 20 or 30 year old, imagine what it’d do to a 9 year old-candy psycho-ADD raging-bull of a child.   If anyone dares drink this latte frappuccino from DQ, tell me what kind of rush you get out of it!

      My 4th of July was pretty cool. I went down to downtown Orinda (its so small I wander if its called "downtown" or just "Orinda") to see this parade that they had going. They had some classic cars, cool; animals, cool; and little kids passing out candy; okay. The candies were warm, but nonetheless, I ate 'em!   Other than that, we had a friend over and played some cards, watched some movies, and just chilled.   I only wish could have gone to San Francisco to buy  illegal  fireworks . . .   . . . oh well.

      Bummer, just found Marlon Brando died at 80. Sad thing. Well, he did have a weight problem and he was 80, but still, he was a great actor who will be missed, truly.  Though I didn't see many Brando films, I did see the amazing "Wild One" and loved it! That film made me wanna buy a leather-jacket from the Goodwill and buy a motorcycle. It was that great!   I wish I had more to write about this amazing actor, but I need to see more of his films. Well, I'll see ya'll later.   Marlon Brando (1924-2004)

      Well, sad day; Rick James died. Sad thing that he died at only 56, but you know that drugs can take a toll, and it did on Rick James. But though there is sadness, I chose my title "It's a celebration bitch" for us to not celebrate his death or mourn him, but to celebrate his life and his music! Though we won't have him around, we'll always have his music around. That's something no one can take away!  In memory - Rick James  (1948-2004)

      Okay, I just finished the most single-handedly worst soda known on planet Earth! The new Coca Cola "C2." It was the only thing in the fridge, and there's only one, cuz my brother got it for free at a local ball-game. Oh my god, I couldn't figure out what it tasted like. I could say it tasted like total ass or a diaper filled with Indian food, or a combination of the two.   I mean, to start of, this soda has like half the fat, calories, and TASTE! It's like, more healthy. For this reason, when I see the commercial it shows a bunch of young 20 year old kids drinking this shit. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOUNG PEOPLE DRINKING THIS. THEY SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT THEIR HEALTH, YET! It's strictly for old-timers, man!   Ugh, I really hope next time I'm desperate for a soda at 12-at-night on a Monday, I choose something better.   ***Word of Advise: DON'T CHOOSE COCA COLA C2, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU CRAVE FOR A SODA!***

      Today I saw the newest M. Night Shyamalan movie "The Village." First off, friggin' tight! Oh man, this film had thrilling and bone-chilling scenes-creepy-ass costumes-and the Oscar-winning Adrien Brody playing your typical village-idiot! I mean, how awesome is that?!  Okay, I wish I could share a lot with you, but it's hard cuz I'd have to give away lots of good information about it, and that'd suck. So, I'll keep it zipped.  You gotta see this movie. It's so great! I mean, if you've liked Shyamalan's previous movies, you'll love this one! And a lot of people I've talked to said that they didn't get the ending. If you pay attention and aren't high on cocaine, you'll get it! I did! If you see it, drop off a comment with your thoughts on the movie.   Well, see ya for now. Go see The Village. It's worth the stupid 7 bucks you (unfortunately) have to pay  . . . Such bullshit!
