      Everyday I have political discussions (arguments) with people. I love talking about politics. I like knowing what is important to someone, and I love to hear someone's rationale behind voting for a given candidate. That being said, I am tired of the discussion revolving around Iraq and terrorism. Don't get me wrong, I think these are VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES, but they are not the only issues. The fact is whoever is elected will continue our "War on Terror." We cannot afford to stand by while there are  credible  threats to our country. I think John Kerry will work to step up US intelligence agencies, and I also think he will seek (and receive) international help in the rebuilding of Iraq. I am convinced that Dubya will be no better at handling these situations.  The first paper I wrote in college was about ending permanent MFN trade status with China. There are numerous reasons I supported this, but the most important reason was the government's history of human rights violations against their own people. I thought (and I still do) that we needed to send a message to China that we would not deal with a government which was abusive to its citizens. I tell you this to highlight my opinion on Iraq. Saddam Hussein was an evil man. I would agree that the Iraqi citizens will be better off in the long run. I have NO problem with us being the world police. I support US intervention in situations of mass genocide or political tyranny. BUT, that's not why we went to Iraq. We went there for WMDs and to settle a score with the guy who tried to kill GW's daddy. I truly believe this, and I won't argue the points. The story obviously changed when it appeared we would not find large stockpiles of weapons. I think the world (and Iraq) is safer without Saddam, but I don't think he was the most glaring threat to US safety. Despite what G-Dub and Dick Cheney have said ("No, I didn't say that...er...go fuck yourself!"), there is no proven link between Saddam and those responsible for 9/11 ( urlLink 9/11 Commission Report  pgs 61 &amp; 66).  I try to think back to March 2003, and I don't recall doubting that Saddam may have WMDs. I do recall thinking that we had troops in Afghanistan (Isn't it something like 10,000 troops v. the 140,000 in Iraq???) looking for bin Laden who to date has not been found. I could not fathom starting another war while we still had troops fighting in another country. Is it good strategy to fight a war on two fronts? I never thought Saddam was a credible threat, and I think the majority of Americans now agree. At the time a lot of people disagreed with me about my opinions. The fact is I love this country. I am a proud American. I support our troops. Those are facts about myself, and they are not issues I will debate. GW says, "You're either with us or you're against us." Although he was speaking about other countries, the undertone has been the same to anyone who does not support his war in Iraq. It's a sad day when you have to clarify that you support the troops even if you disagree with the president. If we are going to support our troops, let's not  urlLink reduce their combat pay . Let's not reduce the death benefit given to families of dead soldiers. Let's not  urlLink cut veterans benefits . Let's  urlLink provide full health coverage to Reservists and their families even when they're not on active duty . Just a thought. I support those things. Now you tell me I don't support our troops. Eat me.

      I do not typically go out a lot. I will meet my friends for Happy Hour, and I go to the occasional BBW hotel party, but I rarely go to clubs or bars on the weekend. Anyway, I DID go out on Saturday night. We went to a place called Yorkshire Pub (West Little Work &amp; Barker Cypress) for Kristin's birthday party which was hosted by Nicole. Kristin and Nicole are both part of a  urlLink BBW group  I hang out with, and I think they are both really nice. There are some women in the group who I think are questionable, but I think Nicole and Kristin are great. Back to the subject- I ended up having a really good time. This place is a karaoke bar. I did everyone a favor, and I did not sing...unless you count singing in my chair without a mic. I drank a few too many Cape Cods, so I was a little more obnoxious than usual. I usually wouldn't talk about such an uneventful night, but there was something that bugs me. There was a guy, Josh, who was there for his sister's birthday, and they were sitting across the dance floor from us. I noticed him looking over at our table during the night. I didn't necessarily think he was looking at me because there were a lot of women at our table. Anyway, Angie and Lisa (Nicole's friends) went over and talked to him sometime during the night, and I guess he told them he thought I was pretty. They didn't mention this to me until later. Anyway, later in the night everyone was on the dance floor dancing, and I got dragged out there. I usually never dance. I am not sure what the problem is. I have pretty good rhythm, but I freeze when I am on the dance floor. I start doing the Elaine (Seinfeld), and I point my fingers and kick my feet. OK, I am not that bad, but it can get ugly. Also, I kept stepping off the sides of my shoes when I walked (Thank you, Cape Cods!), so I did not want to be out there. So, I am out there getting my ass slapped by some girl (don't ask), and I see Angie pull Josh out to the floor. I did my best to get away, but I was stuck with him. This guy was cute, and I choked up. I ended up leaving the dance floor to go get another drink. My hands were actually shaking. I have no idea why. I am not the nervous type, and getting approached by guys in a bar isn't a rare occurrence. Something about the scenario Saturday night freaked me out. I didn't talk to Josh at all that night. I did not give him my number, and he did not give me his. I guess what bugs me about this is that I don't know why I clammed up. I think a large part of it is being put in the situation. Had I talked to him before the dance floor incident, I would have probably stayed on the dance floor. If he had come up to me later in the night, I would have talked to him. Alas, I think my personal insecurities played into it as well. I am still not entirely comfortable being hit on. Most of the guys I have dated will say that I am not the easiest person to get to know. I question everyone's motives, and I trust no one. A lot of people have said I come off as a bitch or a snob (I certainly can be), but I am a pretty likable person once someone gets to know me...at least I think so. I don't know why I make it so difficult on myself. For the past year I have had no desire to date anyone. The last guy I "dated" made me feel like absolute crap when it ended, so I realized I needed to focus on myself and not someone else. I have taken care of a lot of the things that needed changing a year ago. I feel like I finally have the time, energy and desire to invest some of myself in someone else. Still, I make excuses. I plan on moving back to Austin soon, so I don't want to get tied to someone here. That's just a reason to put off having to meet someone until I move. I am sure when I get to Austin I will just be too busy to date. I am not looking for marriage, but I would like someone to care about...and I would love the attention. :) So, Josh, if you read this, sorry I was an idiot. And since he won't be reading this, I guess putting this on the internet somehow makes me feel better about the situation. Blah.

      I used to really enjoy my job.  I loved my boss (even for an Aggie), and I had great co-workers.  Sarah has been my rock the past 18 months.  I was pretty depressed when I moved back to Houston, and I don't know if I would have made it this long living with my parents if I hadn't had her to vent to on a daily basis.  Sarah is a very loyal person, and I am grateful that I have her in my life.  My other co-worker, Elizabeth, has been another source of strength for me.  She has provided me with great "life" advice in the past 9 months.  She helps me keep a rational mind when I get upset about something.  She has also given me career advice that I think is invaluable.  Anyway, our work situation changed in April when we found out our boss, Shanubh, had been promoted to a management position in Austin.  Shanubh is happy in his new position, but he sounds pretty loaded down with work.  Sarah transferred to another office.  She currently works for a great guy, but I think she misses it here.  Elizabeth is currently working at two offices, and she is happy there.  That leads me to my newest co-worker, Rhonda. Rhonda is interesting.  She worked at another office where it's rumored that she was involved in a romantic relationship with the female agent there.  I have absolutely no problem with her being a lesbian (I think she is more of an Anne Heche), but I do think it's an interesting side note for any male readers.  Anyway, I hate working with Rhonda.  We get along on a personal level alright, but I have no respect for her work ethic.  She is lazy, and she has no desire to actually perform the duties of this job.  We don't have a hard job, but you do have to WORK.  That requires that you show up.  On average Rhonda has missed 1/2 a day each week since she started here May 1st.  I guess I would not have a problem with that if I was doing the same thing.  Also, she does not know how to do many of the tasks the job requires, and she will not ask me for help on learning to do them.  She is rude to customers, and she rarely follows up with them.  Finally, she does not have the required licenses or agreements with the company needed to perform work tasks.  I tell you this because I found out in mid-June that she MAKES MORE MONEY THAN ME.  I ended up meeting with my new boss about the situation, and I voiced my concerns.  It was one of my finest hours as far as work is concerned. :)  We worked out the pay issue, but she is still here.  I hate coming to work some days.  I feel like a sucker because she knows she does less work and she comes and goes at her leisure, and I can't do shit about it.  Fark that. I would like to stay with the company but not in this position.  I would like to move into management or development, but that may be down the road.  At that time, I doubt I will want to stay in the Insurance business anyway.

        So...this is my first post. I want to write something interesting, but I am not good with that stuff under pressure. I have no idea who will read this, so I might as well fill it with stuff I may want to remember someday. For the record I am 24 (Aries). I live in Katy, Texas which is outside Houston. I grew up here, and I went to college in Austin at the   urlLink  University of Texas   . I was a Government and Philosophy major, but I have not finished school. I have about a year left, and I really do plan on returning to school. I will likely move back to Austin at the beginning of 2005. There are a few things in this world I am passionate about, so if you read more than one post, I will likely be talking about these things: my family,   urlLink  politics    and   urlLink  University of Texas sports   . I know there are other things in the world to be passionate about, but I choose to focus on these three things, and they keep me pretty occupied.     My family...I love them. My mom is the most important person in my life (rather or not she realizes it), so she affects my whole spectrum of emotions. We have a close relationship, but it has not always been that way. I love my mom dearly, but she is a pain in my ass, and she is also the source of most of my aggravations. Even so, I have no doubt about her love for me. I am fortunate to have all my family in Texas, so I get to see them regularly, and I have relatively close relationships with my cousins, etc. In my family you don't miss a family gathering because we will be talking about you if you aren't there. On the other hand, I am lucky to have a fun, laid back family. Most family parties take place in the kitchen around drinks and a bowl of queso. I have a family who likes to have a good time, and we usually always do. I am sure that I will talk about my family a lot on this thing. Some of the funniest things happen when my family is together.  My second passion is politics. I am a liberal. I have been for as long as I can remember. When I was in the 3rd grade I was the only person in my class who voted for Michael Dukakis in our mock election. I have no idea where my politics came from. I come from a family of Republicans. I get a lot of crap for it, but I realize that when it comes to politics, I believe in my heart what I believe in my head. That being said, I can never be wrong when I follow my conscience. I hope a lot of people feel that way about their social views. When I was in the second grade I wrote a paper about being President when I grow up, and that goal has never really change...but, I have become more practical. I don't want to rule the world, but I would like to work in politics. I always called myself a Democrat. I am further to the left than most Democrats, but I won't be voting for Ralph Nader anytime soon. GW and his goons scare the crap out of me, so I am willing to donate my time and money to getting him out of office. If you return or continue to read, you will see a lot about my political views, so I won't continue to ramble on the subject.  My final passion is Longhorn sports. I don't take bad mouthing or losses well. I have been known to cry after a loss (and a few beers). I am very superstitious. I have several shirts, pairs of underwear and hats I can no longer wear because I wore them during a loss. I once stood on the same tile in a kitchen for 3 quarters of a UT football game because my Horns got the lead back when I started standing there taking shots with a friend. I will lay down on the couch when the Horns have the ball and stand up when the Horns are on defense if I think it works. When I go to games, I am a bit more subtle, but I would lay down in the stands if I thought it would help the Horns win a game. Anyway, I am apprehensive about the start of the College Football season, and I am still licking my wounds after the loss at the CWS. Regardless, I bleed burnt orange.  You've just read more about me than I am sure you wanted to know. If you are still reading, get a hobby. Nothing I said above was very interesting, and I think you could have spent the last several minutes doing something more productive. That being said, I hope you come back and read again. :)
