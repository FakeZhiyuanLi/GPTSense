      i got this email a few hours ago.     clay..i am highly dissapoint in everything you are saying..  first of all not ALL rap is bad..it is music..and if it's what people talent in, then that's their business nothing wring with that. STOP DISSING IT! and it's just the media that makes rap seem all sex oriented..ITS THE MEDIAS RAP! they feel a need to degrade women like that..w/o knowing it..there IS rap that isn't so sexually oriented so, don't stereotype it all.  and no not ALL girls expect their dates to dance real well to rap..and it is NOT near impossible for guys to dance to it!>=O! and NO not JUST breakdancers, gay, or pimps can dance. THERE ARE some respectable guys out there that can dance. and THERE ARE gay people and pimps that CAN't dance..where the fudgin hell did u get that from. STOP STErEOTYPING THINGS!  AND! it is not JUST rap that is all like that..theres some rock and pop n many different kinds of music that are like that..just a way for people to express themselves so don't judge people by their music.  AANNDDD!!! your lil rant about "the notebook" you shouldn't judge it like that specially since you HAVENT seen it yet! just let movies be movies. and NOT all girls like that kinda stuff! WHY ARE THEY CALLED CHICK FLICKS??!! stupid stereotypes..ITS NOT RIGHT!>=O! and "feel good" stuff wtf is wrong with that? wtf is wrong with movies that make people happy? seriously..and soo wat if those movies arent real??! or funny??! there ARE different genres of movies!! OF COURSE a movie categorized in the DRAMA/FICTION section! they wont be funny and/or real!! orr they could be!! but w/e!!!! soo YEA!!  im watching you...       nice job whoever sent this email. apparently you have trouble distinguishing between typing unreadable bullshit on instant messenger and writing a somewhat intelligent email. please, it isn't necessary to type two question marks and two exclamation points to emphasize your point. i realize i do not have perfect grammar in my posts, but that's because i'm lazy, and i write a lot. save for a few minor contraction errors, the only errors in grammar on my posts is bad capitalization. you on the other hand, are unable to write one fucking sentence without tempting my spell-check to commit suicide.   how am i supposed to be able to properly mock this sender's intentions if i can't find out what it was? i can barely read this email. "wtf" "!>=O!" are not words. don't rape my eyes like that.   and what the hell was "AANNDDD!!! " ? do you have some sick desire to make it seem like you are making progress in your email? i've seen retarded kids write better insults in finger-painting class.    you say that the media degrades women? ok, i'll agree with that, but unfortunately you left out the part where it's the women dancing, not the media. women degrade themselves when they dance like that. no one forced them to be media-hugging whores, i don't see girls freak-dancing under gunpoint.    oh, and i'm sorry for "STErEOTYPING" things. you basically stereotyped yourself in this email. you're the typical teeny-bopper virgin who follows trends like a maniac and who thinks it's cute to say "wtf" instead of the noble "what the fuck" it's not cute, it's moronic. shut up. you're writing an email, you're not passing notes to your friends in school. learn to spell check, it's the big button with the small "ABC" and a check mark under it. i'm assuming you know your abc's, but i wouldn't be surprised if you didn't.    sure, they can play rap at mixers. fire away, but i want them to play sometime else for a change. i want fun mixers, with a variety of songs everyone can dance to. can't dance to rock? that's when creativity comes in. that's when you talk to the DJs beforehand, maybe show some moves, so he can show everyone at the mixer. DO SOMETHING.    you also stated that rap is "just a way for people to express themselves so don't judge people by their music." hold on a second. if someone is dancing to express THEMSELVES, then why shouldn't i judge them? they're expressing who they are, i have every right to call them the sluts that they are. actually, you basically justified my right to insult girls who dance like sluts. thanks.     you also said that there is nothing wrong with people feeling good after seeing chick-flicks. this implies that you actually feel better about yourself after seeing a "feel good." way to go, seeing your favorite actors/actresses making out made you appreciate the true value of life, you'll make some horny bum very happy. go into therapy, seriously.    you'll be watching me? what the hell? you think you're some covert spy or something. don't try sneaking up on me, i'll be able to spot a dipshit like you a hundred feet away. people like you are usually recognizable by a fat ass, an obnoxious laugh, and a really desperate boyfriend.     i'm going to stop my dipshit-roasting now, but i'm going to leave a direct quote from the email.  "they wont be funny and/or real!! orr they could be!! but w/e!!!! soo YEA!!"      you're an idiot.

         am i the only one who thinks rap music is shit? come on people, i'm not old fashioned, but i liked it better when there were specific dances to good rock songs (this was big in the 50's and 60's) instead of the rat crap tunes we have today. instead of actually having dances to unique songs at a large dance floor, we have a bunch of slutty teenagers pelvic thrusting each other for what seems like eternity in a tiny room with the temperature no lower than 170 degrees.      the music played at dances is always the usual shitty rap, which is played non-stop by a DJ who never seems to be the appropriate age. the rap music is much like a chunky girl in a two piece, grotesque, yet tacky, and it usually consists of a two-three notes repeated to form a perfect slut song for freshman whores and their horny dates. these damn dances are so long, 80 academy award winning speeches, 6 operas, Clinton's acceptance speech, and the movie "Braveheart" can be viewed before the trainwreck of a dance will finally end.      what ticks me off is when girls think they're god damn queens of the dance floor when they dance to rap. wow, you can swish your fat ass in 10 different directions! we're all proud of your lack of decency. i'm tired of girls expecting their dates to start dancing really well to rap, despite the fact that it's near impossible for guys to dance to it. (unless they're breakdancers, gay, or pimps)      i realize that these days, DJs have no creativity to start new dance moves to fit decent songs, but why not start now? do we continue to create trashier music every year, void of creative dancing or invidiual decency, or can we start new moves, compatible with the many great songs (rock, ska, etc..) that everyone listens to at home?  it's up to us, as human beings, and not as mind-warped machines of the media, to change dances for the better. there used to be open dances, un-slutty enough to be held outdoors, where people could listen and dance to great hits from truly classic bands like The Contours, and we could have that. outdoor dances, without the seizure-inducing disco lights, or the fuss of seeing your best friend grotesquely bonded to some freshman warthog. we need to change this crap now, before it gets worse than country music.      by the way, country music blows. it all sounds the same, the message is the basic "America is great, life is beautiful, everyone hold hands and make babies" please. i can write better songs pissing on snow.      what more can i say?

         i copied the new Punkorama cd into my computer.     now that i have your undivided attention, i feel it is my duty to give a list of people who should have been murdered instead of John Lennon.     carrot top, martha stewart, dave matthews, jack johnson, john mayer, george w. bush, the guy who caught the fly ball at the 2004 cubs game, anyone involved in the Enron scandal, any fat girl who dresses like britney spears, rednecks on motorbikes, racists, anyone who saw "the wedding planner" starring j-lo and enjoyed it, anyone who puts pictures of ben afleck on their wall, the script writers of "the mummey returns", and the fuckhead who decided to put Keanu Reeves' pasty ass in the "matrix reloaded."   beat that

         i saw "Dodgeball" yesterday. it's a pretty funny movie. everyone should go see it.   -    what everyone should NOT go see is a new movie coming out soon called "The Notebook" i saw the preview for it, and it is clearly another shitty chick flick. now these are the chick flicks that come out every season, and they are all the fucking same. seriously girls, are you BLIND??? take The Notebook for example, poor guy falls in love with a rich snobby girl. the girl's parents try to break them up and set her up with a rich prick, while the poor guy's backround is barely viewed at all. toward the end, the two get in a fight over someone blown out of proportion, and right at the end of the movie, the poor guy breaks in at a party or something, professes his love, the the two shove their disease-ridden tongues in each other's faces. the end. everyone single of these shitty movies are just like this. all the producers have to do is make the guy rich and the girl poor, or vice versa, change the actor/actress, and throw in a sterotype (gay guy, token black guy, etc..) for comedy relief and presto! one big expensive wad of cat shit that girls fall in love with. people call these movies "feel goods" when i first heard this, i was first excited because i though it implied that  goods  were being  felt  but then i was confused because it actually meant that girls would feel good after viewing the multi-million dollar holocaust. now, if a girl is so moody that she's gonna feel better about herself if she sees two celebrities play grab ass for 2 hours, then she should go into prostitution, because her personality isn't doing any good to anyone.      these movies are not real, they aren't funny, and they will never happen to you. girls, prince charming is never going to grab you off the street and take you away to his castle, and guys, watching porn doesn't make you a man. (this comment goes to my georgetown prep buddies)  - wake up you morons

        alright first blog.Tell me if it looks stupid. oh, if you're obsessed with correct grammar, screw you.       ok, everyone needs to stop obsessing about celebrities' lives. seriously, if you actually buy those shitty magazines about who's banging who, or who's pregnant, then you officially have no life. leave them alone and get a life. no one should give a shit about ben afleck and that whore j-lo. afleck is a shitty actor and his movies blow except for "Armageddon" and j-lo, well, no comment neccessary for her.      also, can you people stop talking about the celebrities you have a crush on? girls especially. listen you vain whores, brad pitt doesn't like you. he doesn't even KNOW you. he'd rather be nailing Jennifer Aniston than some wannabe slut from Wheaton. next girl who gasps during a movie when a certain actor pops on the screen gets bitch slapped.

       vacationing ın turkey was pretty sweet, but i won't talk much about that. i'll simply say that europe makes the u.s. look like a used condom.  on to serious news. i can't believe i have not written this article before. here are the places where no one should make out, but ironically, these places are where people like to exchange saliva most.  1. the ocean  - everytime i go to the beach, i see a couple either hugging, making out, or drowning. who the hell would want to do that in the ocean? who wants to see that? not me. i can only imagine the conversation that stimulates two sex-deprived people to make every living creature on the beach gag.  horny guy: oh baby, the taste of salt and urine in my mouth combined with the crabs biting my ass really TURNS ME ON. horny girl: same here, except this eel keeps poking me. horny guy: what eel?  - next time i see people doing this in the ocean, im going to throw raw lamb on them so the sharks get them. that will teach the horny bastards.   2. the pool  - this one i can somewhat understand. i admit, kissing someone in the pool infested with slutty 13 year olds while your bathing suit rides up your ass like a lawyer can become very stimulating. come on people, do you have any idea what's in that water? let me educate you.  pool water  30% chlorine 60% baby urine 10% used bandaids  - emphasis on the bandaids.   3. the front row of a movie theater  - i wouldn't mind this so much if people kept that crap in the back row. please, im begging you, do it in the back row. the people frenching in the front are so incredibly loud i can hear them over the ear-distorting advertisement of THX. one time, the tongue buddies blocking my view of russel crowe kicking ass were so loud i could hear their conversation/semi-mating ritual which i wrote down for your enjoyment.  girl: oh, i love you ben   guy: my name is david   girl: oh, whatever. you're the bomb man   guy: how did you know i had a bomb?   girl: i didn't say..... oh.. HOLY SHIT!   guy: BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHA   BOOM         right then the theater was reduced to splinters. but i, being the undeniable beast i am, survived and was able to spit on the crumbling ashes of that shitty theater. i forget what movie was playing, but it probably sucked.          4. in church      - you've seen it, we all have.         5. a school play      - i understand that most highschool and middle school plays are very good. especially private highschools, (sarscasm morons) but there's one big reason why frenching during a play is stupid. want a hint?         YOU PAID FOR IT YOU DUMBASS      - i'll leave it at that. email me with more ideas if you want.

        there are many good movies i have seen these past years. "training day", "gladiator" and "the godfather" are a few examples. however, there will always be films that are, inexcusably shitty.     so here are the top six worst movies i've seen.     6. SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE: this movie wouldn't suck so much if it wasn't so nasty. basically, it's a 2 hour movie about people of very different ages going out with each other. jack nicholson makes out with some 17 year old dumbass, and then has sex with her mom, diane keaton. i wouldn't hate this movie so much if i didn't have to pull out my eyes with a plunger after seeing diane keaton naked.     5. THE WEDDING PLANNER: that guy in this movie, matthew whatever, is a pussy. he hasn't stared in a single good movie. ed tv? how to lose a guy in ten days? what the hell? this guy obviously has no balls, it's the only explanation for being in such crappy movies. anyways, this movie blows. nothing happens except for the last 15 minutes, in which the two main characters ditch their fiances.  what kind of message does this show? true love is found by ditching your fiance at the last possible moment for someone you barely know? this movie sucks and i hate that slut j-lo. i don't care how good she is at singing, she's a shitty actress, and therefore, makes shitty movies. shitty shitty shitty.     4. SLEEPY HOLLOW: this movie was HORRIBLE. the plot sucked, the acting was horrific, and the action was fake. the blood in this movie looked like seizure-pink candle wax. the only cool part is this movie was when the headless horseman impaled someone with a stake from a fence, but besides that, the constant beheading got old, (yeah, beheading can be made boring now), and this movie just plain sucked. i expected more from johnny depp.     3. GOTHIKA: halle berry plays a crazed doctor of some kind who is possessed by a girl who knows something secret, and halle berry murders her lump of lard of a husband, and in the end, she shoots some security guard in a methane-gas filled room without burning alive. sound stupid?     2. WHAT A GIRL WANTS: amanda bynes (or however you spell it) plays the normal girl who finds out she's related to someone rich. her rich relatives try to set her up with some rich snob, but she falls for the financially troubled local.   i guess it's not exactly a RULE to make original movies.     1. DOWN WITH LOVE: down indeed. this movie tops them all. if i hadn't seen this movie in the early afternoon, i would have fallen asleep right on the slimy floors. this crappy piece of excrement is complete with predictable plot twists and fucking horrible acting. BING BING BING, call a janitor because there's puke in the theater.    email me if you know any other crappy movies that i didn't mention, and i might post them.   by the way, i'm going on vacation for 3 weeks, so don't expect any new posts for a while. even though all the kids who leave hate comments are going to check my site 24/7.   tools  &nbsp; UPDATE: number 7 on this list goes to "max keeble's big move" that movıe was so bad i would rather watch a private highschool play. no joke it was  that bad.

         you can't deny it, but there are very few truly funny commercials out there on popular channels like FOX and TBS. i don't know whether these commercials became more shitty over a long period of time, or simply that all the heads of major networks decided to air commercials that make ray ramano seem comical.      here's a few commercials that made me so angry, i got constipated.      CAR COMMERCIALS: almost every single one of them blow. the big cars are usually shown climbing over massive hills and canyons, trying to look impressive, unknowing that i don't give a shit. who the hell buys into that trash? how many people who buy huge trucks actually go hiking and rescue other cars in the rain? give me a break. the small cars aren't as poorly displayed, but it still pisses me off because it usually shows the car driving on long, open, curvy roads. ooh, i'm driving a mazda on the open road, i feel so free, so liberated, so gyped. almost everyone who buys the car will end up spending half their life in traffic, so the entire, driving on the open road campaign, is bullshit.      PERFUME/SHAMPOO COMMERCIALS: every time i see one of these commercials, spaghetti-corroded bile rises to my throat. i'm not kidding, these commercials make me throw up so much, i could turn bulimic.     on a more concrete note, i saw a perfume commercial (or nail polish, it all smells the same) where these two women saw this guy, giggled, then saw the fragrance in the store window, giggled again, THEN they looked at each other and giggled one more time.      WHAT THE FUCK?     some perfume commercials are just weird, usually complete with delusional music and models staring straight at the camera with a demented look in their eyes. no comprende senor.       CARROT TOP: this "guy", although he barely qualifies, is the lowest scrap of filth to hit this planet. i'm not going to even describe his commercials about 1-800-COLLECT, but i will tell you that it is my life long passion to produce a movie in which carrot top dies in many different ways for about 2 hours. hey, "gigli" is about that length, which would you rather see?     that's all i'll write for today. if you have any other suggestions, email me.

         no one can argue my point, reality shows are a waste of time. they are almost as bad as soap operas. (which i may add, are the worst pieces of shit to hit television) they are composed of the following;     1. predictable plot involving money, or marriage. or both.  2. a handful of good looking guys who really want to get laid, or a handful of slutty girls who want to flaunt their lack of decency on t.v.   3. over dramatic shit music.   4. a lot of crying  5. bullshit     just smash these things together and WHAM! you got a reality show millions of people will watch. it's unbelievable how stupid these viewers are. wake up people. all these shows are the same! i can't tell if they are scripted or not, and if they are, the writers did a really fucked up job.      now, i'm not talking about the "reality" shows on mtv, because i don't even have mtv. so don't send me your shit about how "real" mtv is.      the worst part about these shows is that there's always some stupid girls, (or even guys, those pussies) crying. just crying ALL THE DAMN TIME. they don't shut up. ooh, you got booted off a show by a guy you barely know, bitching about girls you hate for no reason. please. why do these people cry after they get kicked off the show? come on, you knew the guy for a month, get over it. even if you won, the relationship whouldn't last long anyways. even if it did, it's kind of sad that true love would be found on a trashy t.v. show on FOX.      to help reality shows be more enjoyable, i'm going to list one simple solution that could turn rat crap shows like "outback jack" into something a normal beast like myself could endure without retching into a doggy bag.      1. stop making crappy reality shows     man, these people need jobs.

         i have just found out that marlon brando passed away. if you don't know him, let me enlighten your sheltered life. marlon brando played the godfather in the movie "The Godfather" he was a beast, by simple definition. if anyone didn't respect him in that movie, they would wake up with a horse's head in their blankets. he was also an amazing actor, and for this, i salute him. i will also supply a short list of people who qualify for the title of "a beast" (besides myself)     marlon brando, anthony hopkins, gene hackman, gandalf, alfred hitchcock, johnny depp, captain barbosa from Pirates of the Caribbean, breakdancers, morpheus, NOFX, and nicholas cage.      i realize i missed quite a few, but those are the ones i could think on the top of my head.      when i watched "the godfather" , i noticed how awesome the acting was. the actors were a lot better 10-20 years ago. which makes me think, what new actors have introduced themselves lately? every movie that comes out, has the same actors/actresses from 5 years ago. have any of you seen any new actors in movies? if they are, please inform me, because i can't think of any right now.     oh i almost forgot, anyone who sees "sleepover" needs to be shot. repeatedly. the storyline is shit. i havent seen it yet, but from commercials it looks like the usual cute girl who no one knows quickly gets popular when her friends help her wear "cooler" clothes, and then she'll win over some popular "hottie" and everyone is happy. of course, the director will throw in the usual mean blonde girl, and a few pranks for comdey relief. the pranks will probably be cheesy,(like stealing a guy's underwear, but no one can be THAT un-original) and will end up with the girls giggling their heads off, because they won't be properly punished. ooh, i'm cute, i got this guys attention because i jumped off a scateboard. please. if people think that real life works that way, they need to wake up. i don't know whether that movie is supposed to be a chick-flick or a little kids comedy. i think it's a deadly combination of the two, which makes it even more shitty.     it's like movie producers are trying to piss me off.     before you send me hateful comments, watch the movie, and see how right i am. i think i'm going to see it just so i can see how much of a beast i am.

         i was going to ignore this email, but because it was so amusing, i'm going to post it anyways.       Hm. Rappers make tens to hundreds of millions of dollars recording their "cRAP". You, however, have written 5 paragraphs of utter Maddox-ripping bullshit and are none the richer. The only good part about this piece of crap that you wrote was the end. Oh, and your bit about country music was cute- when your snow-pissed album goes gold, call me. I'd like to buy it and shove it up your penis-filled ass.         wow, i didn't know rappers made money, thanks for the update dipshit. of course they're going get rich when people like you buy their damn overpriced cds. just because they make tons of money doesn't mean it isn't crap in my opinion.      "maddox-ripping bullshit?" excuse me? i don't remember maddox ever talking about how shitty rap music is, and besides, it's my damn blog, no one forced you to read it. don't you have a $20 crap CD to buy?     my penis-filled ass? so you want ass-rape me or something? i didn't know back-dooring someone was an accepted way to vent out your anger about a blog from someone you probably don't even know.      instead of making a solid point in the comments you left on my site, you preferred to provide threats of raping me. instead of feeling scared, like you probably thought i would be, i'm feeling disgusted. i can imagine your stupid smug grin as you threaten people over the internet, and it pisses me off how stupid you are. however, i'm feeling quite generous today, so i'm going to give you a bit of advice for the next time someone's webpage angers you. here it is.     1. find a cliff  2. jump off it.       it's simple. besides, what's the point sending me angry comments anyways? i know you're going to check my page 3 times a day, hoping to God that your shitty comments were posted.      loser

       have you ever sat down after another pointless day in a trashpile of a highschool and couldn't wait to watch your favorite shows like simpsons when you realize that it has been blocked by a sport that you don't care about? i have, and it's an excruciatingly painful experience. sports should not be shown on major networks. if kids want to watch the red sox screw up, then they can watch it on the dozen sports channels that cable has to offer. if they cant do that, then they can either go to the game, or go to hell. at least i don't have to scroll through channels until i get blisters the size of condoleeza rice's teeth on my fingers until i can find something to watch.  sports should not be shown on major networks like NBC or FOX. however, if they aren't ever going to be pulled off major channels, then i thought it is my duty to write down ways to improve sports that are boring to watch.   1. baseball  - you can't possibly argue my point. baseball may be fun to play, but it is SO BORING TO WATCH. who the hell spends there time watching one game for 4 hours? it's even worse when the teams decide to extend the already suffocating nine innings into ten or sometimes even eleven and twelve innings. it's even worse when the end result tallies up to be a pathetic 2-1. if i was the coach of a baseball team, and the score was 0-0 and it's tenth inning, i would throw in the towel and see a shrink for some explanation for why i signed up for such a horribly dull job.  - oh yeah, to improve it. instead of nine (or more) innings. make it zero. the game is over. the players would just stand around in the heat and spit tobacco at each other like deranged camels for about five minutes until i turn on the sprinklers. that would kick so much ass.   2. nascar racing  - it's unbelievable that no one ever talks about this. it amazes me that people can sit in their chairs and watch a commercial that shows fast-foward display of the pit crew, and cars zooming at skirt-tossing speeds. the actual race on television can be described in one word; nauseating. after the first 57 laps you begin to feel queasy, and by the time all unscathed (despite all the hot stories you've heard) cars head home, you turn into calista flockhart. (my term for a bulimic)  - to improve the horribly dull televised "sport" , every person who is watching nascar will be traced and immediately delivered five pounds of weed. that way, no one will have to feel annoyed about their show being rejected when they can watch cars drive in circles while toked up. plus, all the watchers at home will get the munchies the next morning, which means money for food businesses like safeway. it's brilliant.   3. ice hockey.  - you got into a fight, WE GET IT. we don't give a damn that some guy takes his shirt off on the cold hard ice and tries to fight one of his opponents. what a moron, seriously. if i were him, i would keep the uniform on and clothes-line the victim with my hockey stick.  - hockey lacks a certain quality and satisfaction that i require from television. at the end of a hockey match, i don't feel like cheering. i feel like crying for wasting my time when i could have done something more useful like pour brown sugar down my pants.  - what hockey needs is explosives. lots of explosives. instead of a puck, make it a grenade. last player left standing gets nuked.   - there are many others, but i wanted to write about the sports that are interrupting quality movies and shows. the sports i listed above may be enjoyable to play, but in terms of viewing, they suck more than a desperate, depressed, drugged up, drunk ditz at a party.  - email me (the address is on top of the page just in case your vision sucks) with any ideas for my blog. i have plenty of ideas, but im sure some people would like theirs expressed.  - ha

       many girls sometimes consider me sexist against females, and nothing could be further from the truth. in fact, just to silence the chilling screams of brainless feminists, i'm writing this article about things a guy should never do.      NOTE: when i use the word "guy" "girl" or "carrot top" i do not mean every single one. if i did mean that, i would say it.      1. open class discussions about how you got laid but actually didn't      - im sitting in spanish class one day, which i may add, is a waste of time because private highschools are incapable of securing a confident, qualified spanish teacher, and some lardass decides to talk to his buddy about how much he "got" the previous night. his buddy was ACROSS THE ROOM. "ooh i got to third with a fat and drunk ho-bag." big deal. no one cares about how far you got with some lame girl who likes the sports you play but at the same time spends all her time at your games drinking kool-aid and strutting in front of the stands in an attempt to get her tissue-stuffed shirt noticed.       "oh man i got laid" BULLSHIT. no you didn't. and even if you did, you hit rock bottom in terms of sucking up to do it.         2. mock other kids who don't play three sports.      the kids who you picked on for choosing academics over athletics will always be more successful than you. very few kids "make it big", so why try it if you aren't even that good? dipshits who can catch a football, yet can't spell "fantastic" shouldn't be popular, yet they seem to be the most admired in private schools.      what the hell?      give it up, after your brief fiesta of slutty girls, cheap beer, pussy teachers, and over-rated parties in highschool, you'll find yourself selling lacrosse sticks at sports authority instead of using them. don't try to come up with lame insults that don't even make sense to you against kids who are smarter than you. of course, if the un-popular kid easily crushes your argument and proves you're a dipshit, you can always take the easy way out and slam your steroid pumped fists into him.       3. you're not a rebel, shut up.      - time and time again, im seeing kids putting stickers on stop signs, spray-painting school walls, and mooning innocent people who would rather have their elbows bitten off by radioactive racoons than see your fat, blistered ass.     -  the only time ive ever "stolen" a sign was when i snatched a sign that read "shoplifting is a crime, we prosecute" and i only did that for the hilarious irony.    - who cares that you carved "chris loves cock" on the desk? im sure chris gives a damn. or anyone for that manner.      - also, writing down your racist crap on the desk/bathroom wall only proves how much of an ignorant, pathetic loser you are. it's like a confession.      4. dont use pick up lines      - they rarely work, and any girl who is brain dead enough to buy into "smooth" invitations from movies and t.v. shows that don't make any sense, probably isn't worth using the line on anyways. it's lose-lose situation.      5. watch porn so much.      - the more you watch porn, the more desperate you become. i even made a chart to help you.       times a day/ desperation         1-2 - semi normal.      3-5 - not too good. you fantasize about britney   spears too much. you have trouble talking   to a girl without picturing her naked.      6-10 - get a life. get a hobby. GET SOMETHING.    because it's clear you aren't getting any from    the ladies, or anything else outside your   computer for that matter.      11-24 - if you have even scrolled down this far to    measure your obvious desperation that means   it's time to get the hands off the shaft and    rebuild the social life you abandoned you    useless prick.         over 24 - this means you can watch    people hump each other every hour.   (unless your into weird kinky sex you freak)    leave this country.            - those are the big ones. i'll write an article about things girls should never do in a while.       - by the way, "the bourne supremacy" was pretty good. go see it instead of that atrocity "the notebook"

       although this comment has been here for a while, but because im bored, im going to write about anyways.        Anonymous said... In "email roasting", he spends about 3 paragraphs blasting someone's grammar.  - you can tell the clever critic is trying to mock the fact i wrote three paragraphs about the mass homicide of the english language in "email roasting."  - fortunately, with the aid of the DELETE key, i have magically transformed the impossible-to-read, infinite three paragraphs, into a basic one paragraph that any moron can read without slamming their thick head on the keyboard in frustration.    - oh, i guess i wrote more than one paragraph in this article. boy, aren't i the little rascal.  - bite me
