       Yeah okay, this is my very first blog, and my very first entry in my blog (love that word man!) Um anyway, I decided to start up one of these because of Emily. Darn you Emily! Now I actually have sumthing to do! Grrrr.      Anywho, I'm apparently gonna have a busy week. Not only is one of my cousins here until Tuesday, I have to go to a wedding on Saturday. And the wedding is for my half-brother. I have one hell of a crazy family: a mom, dad, step-dad, 1 brother, two half-brothers, a half-sister, and the biggest extended family you can imagine. Holidays are always insane, but in a good way.       Right now I'm listening to a CD I just burnt and am currently downloading music via WinMX. The program is crap. It's installed a whole bunch of spyware on my computer and my mum pitched a fit and I narrowly escaped being in major shit. Heh heh, that rhymed... Yeah, my mum can be kind of a pain. She tends to be pretty laid back, but sumtimes you gotta watch your ass around her, or KABOOM! I've seen it happen more times than I can count. And this song turned out shitty. Dammit! It's treble charger, "Hundred Million" which I just d/led a couple days back. And this version of the song is really bad quality. Dammit dammit dammit!!!!      Hmm I'm actually excited about school starting up. Which is weird, because I don't even like school that much. There's about a gazillion other things to do that are tons more fun than listening to sum balding guy prattle on about shit that I'll never need to know. And goddamn it I want my bloody schedule. I only took 6 courses and I'll have 2 spares but for crying out loud I want to know when I have what.       Recently I got glasses, which I have needed forever. And for sum odd reason, I'm not wearing them now. I'd go get them but they're all the way downstairs and I'm lazy, and fuck it, I can see the screen just fine. Seriously, I only need them for distance, but I generally wear em all the time. I got braces too, and my dentist/orthodontist is a crackhead. Seriously, the dude doesn't know what he's doing! I don't like him. I had to wear a retainer for two years, and I mean wear it, because it was cemented into my mouth. And guess what? It didn't do diddley-shit! Stupid dentist. He's a spawn of Satan, I tells ya.      I'm not that tired, which is a definite bad thing. That means I'm gonna be waking up at noon again. Considering I gotta clean my room sumtime in the next few days, cuz we're trying to sell our house, and my room looks like several natural distasters hit it all at once. So yeah, I need all the time I can get. And yeah, I also need to do laundry some time this week, plus on Wednesday I gotta pack for my four day long trip to Ottawa, which is where my brother (Andy) is gettin married.      Anyways, my back is friggin killin me and I'm thirsty. And none of my friends are online, so I don't really got anything to do. Damn boring computer. Well I'll write more tomorrow. Peace and shit until then.
