      Ha ha!  Now I can talk absolute crap all over the world, with ease!  I'm off to Glastonbury tomorrow, my first time.  The weather reports aren't exactly positive but I do have 2 litres of vodka, so I should be okay.  I think I can buy more vodka if it starts raining really hard though.

      ... done nothing!  Went to a bbq to celebrate Eneko's wife's birthday on Friday.&nbsp; French people comfortably outnumbered "normal" people, but everyone admirably spoke in English.&nbsp; I tried to impress everyone with my limited knowledge of French, but it quicky became apparent the only French I&nbsp;know&nbsp;is&nbsp;"J'abite la fromage", which I believe means "I live in cheese".  Played guitar for most of yesterday, writing two songs that at the time seemed to be the greatest songs ever written, but in hindsight were as bad as my usual efforts.&nbsp; Went into work today for a couple of hours today, damn my enthusiasm.&nbsp;

      Split up with girlfriend.  I think she's utterly crazy and has a major temper problem, but I imagine she'd say similar things about me (remember she is crazy though).  She showed me her holiday photos from a couple of weeks ago, and got really angry when I didn't fawn over them like they were works of art.  I should note they consisted almost entirely of her in a bikini with another guy (thankfully not in a bikini).  It was easily the most exciting break-up I've ever had.  There was shouting, swearing, door slamming, housework(?!) and even punching (although certainly not from me).  I just want to find a girl that isn't crazy and actually likes me, two things that seem to unfortunately form some kind of universal paradox.  Colin took me to see a Bon Jovi tribute band to help take my mind off things, something of an expedition considering my current state.  It was worth it though, Jon looked like a gay hairdresser and Richie was uber-cool and wore a cowboy hat.  I want to be a cowboy.

      I've been trapped in my flat for the past week, and I'm bored out of my tiny mind.    I had an operation on my lower back last weekend, and I've been recovering ever since.  Well I say "lower back" but I really mean "ass".  It's not pretty, I'd put pictures up if I didn't know it would mentally scar anyone who saw them.  At least I can sit down now, I was reduced to lying on an inflatable mattress in my living room for the first few days. The TV aerial's broke with perfect timing so I can't even watch Tricia in the mornings and shout at the stupid people.  Alex (girlfriend) should be round soon to help relieve the boredom, which is nice.  Just finished watching Rocky on DVD, I'm amazed at how I still can't help but shout "C'mon Rocky!" during the last 5 minutes of the film.  Watched a recent video interview with Sly afterwards, he looks funny.  Not quite Michael Jackson funny, but not a million miles away.
