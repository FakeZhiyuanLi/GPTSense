       1994   Annualized unemployment rate for whites = 5.3 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks = 11.48 percent Differential between jobless rate for blacks versus jobless rate for whites = 217 percent   1995   Annualized unemployment rate for whites = 4.86 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks = 10.37 percent Differential between jobless rate for blacks versus jobless rate for whites = 213 percent   1996    Annualized unemployment rate for whites = 4.68 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks = 10.51 percent Differential between jobless rate for blacks versus jobless rate for whites = 225 percent  So, therefore, I must ask:  Was Bill Clinton a racist?  * * *  Furthermore:   1996 vs. 2004   Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 1996 - Clinton = 10.51 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 2004 - Bush = 10.16 percent  Hmm. A  lower  rate of joblessness for blacks, in the fourth year of Bush's term, when matched up against the comparable period in Clinton's first term.  Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 1996 - Clinton = 225 percent Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 2004 - Bush = 206 percent  Hmm. To the extent there is a "class divide" in rates of joblessness, it was more pronounced,  under Clinton , in the last year of his first term, when compared to the current year's labor markets, under Bush.   1995 vs. 2003   Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 1995 - Clinton = 10.37 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 2003 - Bush = 10.82 percent  Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 1995 - Clinton = 213 percent Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 2003 - Bush = 207 percent   1994 vs. 2002   Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 1994 - Clinton = 11.48 percent Annualized unemployment rate for blacks - 2002 - Bush = 10.30 percent  Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 1994 - Clinton = 217 percent Differential between black/white (annualized) jobless rates - 2002 - Bush = 201 percent  Hmm. For the respective periods under consideration here -- each of which span three full years -- the economy under Clinton produced a higher rate of unemployment for blacks in two of said years. Moreover, in the second, third, and fourth years of Clinton's initial term, the discrepency in jobless rates, between blacks and whites, was  larger  than the respective discrepencies, in comparable periods, under George W. Bush.  So, as a result, we again have the Party of "racial unity" versus the Party of racists, no?  I have only one additional query, then:  Which Party is which?

       1996 - Bill Clinton    Average  un employment rates - Jan. 1st through July 31st:  Whites - 4.8 percent Blacks - 10.46 percent Hispanics - 9.4 percent Women - 4.84 percent   2004 - George W. Bush   Average  un employment rates - Jan. 1st through July 31st:  Whites - 4.94 percent Blacks - 10.16 percent Hispanics - 7.11 percent Women - 4.96  Ah, yes.  The Party of racial and gender "diversity" versus the the Party of . . . racists and misogynists!  Right?  Note: Data  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      The latest measure of consumer confidence rose sharply from the level at which it came in last month.  In fact, this particular index of consumer sentiment -- published by the Associated Press-Ipsos Reid -- has been  urlLink rising for four consecutive months , and is  substantially higher  than the level at which it came in, last August.  Yes, Virginia, mainstream Americans know whether or not they have jobs.  And they know whether their personal financial conditions are good or poor.   The fact that the partisan-liberal media keeps telling voters that there are not "enough jobs," or that the jobs aren't "good jobs," or that they should have "economic angst," makes no difference whatsoever in how they feel.

      Racially-conscious partisan liberals and African-American and Hispanic Democrats (whether liberal or not) tend to jump out their seats with enthusiasm over the Clinton Presidency, in general, and, specifically, with regards to Clinton's economic policies.  Hmm.  I must ask:  Why?   UNEMPLOYMENT RATES    July 2000   Whites - 3.5 percent Blacks - 7.7 percent Hispanics - 5.6 percent   July 1999   Whites - 3.7 percent Blacks - 8.8 percent Hispanics - 6.2 percent   July 1998    Whites - 3.8 percent Blacks - 9.7 percent Hispanics - 7.2 percent   July 1997    Whites - 4.2 percent Blacks - 9.4 percent Hispanics - 7.9 percent   July 1996     Whites - 4.7 percent Blacks - 10.5 percent Hispanics - 9.0 percent   July 1995    Whites - 4.8 percent Blacks - 11.1 percent Hispanics - 8.8 percent    July 1994*     Whites - 5.4 percent Blacks - 11.2 percent Hispanics - 10.1 percent   The "first Black President," huh?  Well, then, it would seem to me that, at least regarding economic issues, Clinton did a pretty ghastly job on behalf of his bretheren.  Note: *On these particular issues, the BLS's archived data does not go back further than 1994.  Note: The data can be accessed  urlLink here .

      Negative.  I believe the major averages are grossly overvalued under any fundamental analysis.  While the recent selling is welcome, it's not sufficient, in my view, to justify a broad, material investment into stocks; at least not at this juncture.  Wake me up if the DOW is at 9,000 and the S&P 500 is at 975.  At that point, I might consider putting serious money into the markets.  Until then,  Zzzzzzzzz.  Favorite stocks (right now):  Washington Mutual (WM)  It's cheap.  What more could you want?

      On August 2, 1996, during Saint Bill's re-election campaign, the Labor Department released its employment report for July of that year. At that time, the unemployment rate was reported to have been 5.4 percent,  an increase  from the prior month's reported rate.*  A  urlLink transcript  of NBC's "Nightly News" program, for August 2, 1996 (the very same night of that unemployment report) indicates that over a dozen subjects were addressed. None of those subjects were that day's unemployment figures.  On the other hand, earlier today the Labor Department reported that unemployment in this country  fell last month ; from 5.6 percent to 5.5 percent. In connection therewith, the Department had the grim task of reporting that "only" 32,000 W-2 jobs were created across the country.  On tonight's "Nightly News" program, on NBC, one of their lead stories is:  " urlLink Troubling jobs report ."  The teaser?   Employment numbers are weak for the second month in a row, which may become a problem for the Bush campaign. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. Hmm.  Oh, right. Bush is a Republican; Clinton is a Democrat.  How silly of me.  Note:* Ultimately, the unemployment rate, for July 1996, was stated to have been 5.5 percent, up from a rate of 5.3 percent, in June 1996, and up from the initial stated rate, for July, of 5.4 percent.

      Since WWII, only two elected Presidents who stood for re-election have been defeated: Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush.  Why did they lose?  Several reasons, in both cases.  What was the common denominator, however?   1980   Unemployment rate in January = 6.3 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 7.8 percent.   1992   Unemployment rate in January = 7.3 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 7.7 percent.  Hmm. In both cases, the unemployment rate was higher, as of July 31st of their campaign years, than it was in January of those years. And unemployment certainly was not low, in either case, to begin with.  And the Carter economy, by far, experienced a much steeper increase in the unemployment rate. And, sure enough, the margin by which Carter lost was far greater. Carter's opponent received a majority of the vote, in a three-man race, whereas, Clinton, also in a three-man race, garnered merely 43 percent.  Hmm.  Now, check this out:   1996   Unemployment rate in January = 5.6 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 5.5 percent. Percentage decline in unemployment rate = 1.79 percent. Result: Clinton wins re-election, with over 350 electoral votes to his name.   1972    Unemployment rate in January = 5.8 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 5.6 percent. Percentage decline in unemployment rate = 3.45 percent. Result: Nixon wins in a vast landslide, taking 49 out of 50 states.   1980    Unemployment rate in January = 8.0 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 7.5 percent. Percentage decline in unemployment rate = 6.25 percent. Result: Reagan wins in the largest electoral vote landslide, in U.S. history.  Hmm. There seems to be a connection between the amount by which the unemployment rate declined, in those respective re-election years, and not only the result, but the margin of victory too.   2004   Unemployment rate in January = 5.6 percent. Unemployment rate in July = 5.5 percent. Percentage decline in unemployment rate = 1.79 percent. Result: Hmm. The  exact same numbers  that the country experienced under Clinton.  So, therefore, I'm betting on the liberal Junior Senator from Massachusetts. Um,  someone else's money , that is.

      I really like the premise of this new movie, " urlLink Collateral ."  And Michael Mann is a great director.  But Tom Cruise as -- ahem -- a contract killer?  I've got an issue with that.  Imagine the exact same script, the exact same director, and the exact same supporting cast, but with one of the following actors playing Cruise's role:  1)  De Niro, 2)  James Woods, 3)  Gary Sinise, 4)  Sean Penn.  I'll go to see it, but, frankly, my expectations won't be too high.

      Easy:  Bjurman, Barry Micro-Cap Growth. Ticker symbol: BMCFX.  Man, I'm starting to get excited about this one.  It has fallen almost 27 percent since its most recent high point, back in January. I like that! This fund gets crushed when the market goes down, but soars when the market goes up. It invests in fast-growing, small companies. High risk; high reward. The key, of course, like any stock-based fund, is buying when things are "bad" and not even looking at it when it's going well.  I'll be putting money into this fund on Monday. If it falls even further? Well, then, I'll put even a  larger amount of money  into it.  BTW, this fund is closed to new investors. But, you might be able to get into it, if you're so inclined, by investing in one of Bjurman's other funds, keeping some sort of minimum balance there, then transfering money into the micro-cap fund.   urlLink www.bjurmanbarry.com , for more info.  For those looking to take advantage of these lower prices (buy low, sell high, right?), another fine option in the small-company mutual fund universe, at least IMO, is  urlLink FMI Focus (FMIOX) .

      Worried about how the gloom and doom headlines concerning the below-expecations W-2 job gains might affect this year's election?  Thinking that the GOP should pull a Torricelli switch, and nominate Condi Rice by acclamation?  Relax!!!  Have a Starbucks.  First, in what Solar System is a fall in unemployment, a gain in payroll employment (32,000), a gain in non-payroll employment (597,000), and a gain in hourly earnings suddenly "bad news?"  Sure, in the mind's eye of our media perhaps.  But, do you think this even will register on Main Street?  Fah-get-a-bout-it.   People know if they're employed or not.  They don't run to the newsracks on Saturday, in Columbus, Ohio, to find out how people are doing, in Reno, Nevada.  And they don't need to tune into Chris Matthews to find out how their companies are doing.  They observe that with their own two eyes.  People are not that stupid, you know.  Plus, it's high time, in my view, that someone exposes the national political media for what it truly is:  A relic of our history, in steep decline, and soon to be completely irrelevant, if not extinct.  Or, to put it another way:  RATINGS!  Or, more specifically, the  lack thereof .  Check this out:   ELECTRONIC POLITICAL MEDIA    1960   The largest audience for one of the debates between Nixon and Kennedy attracted 80.6 million viewers.  At that time, the entire country had a population of 183.7 million persons.   Nearly  45 percent of the country  watched that particular debate.   1992   The largest audience for one of the debates between Bush, Clinton, and Perot attracted 70 million viewers.  Now, let's stop right there.  Even on a nominal basis, that is an outright decline of 13 percent, from the high-water mark of 1960's campaign.  Of course, the population grew in between 1960 and 1992.  As of the latter date, the country's population was 248.7 million.  Therefore, from 45 percent of the country, in 1960,  only 28 percent of the country  tuned into the 1992 debate season, at its  highest  level of interest.   They lost over a third of their audience over a period of less than 35 years.   2000   Here's where the "mainstream" electronic political media began to degenerate into self parody.  There were three debates between Bush and Gore.  On average, a grand total of merely 36.7 million people tuned in.  Again, even on a notional basis, that represents a stunning decline from the already-depressed ratings from the 1992 campaign.  But then there's the population factor.  The country's population stood at 281.4 million, as of year 2000.  Therefore, from 28 percent of the populace, in 1992, the percentage of the country who tuned into the year-2000 Presidential debates, on average,  merely was 13 percent .  Big TV media lost half of their remaining, population-adjusted Presidential debate audience, over a period of only eight years.  (The data can be accessed by going  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , then  urlLink here .)   PRINT MEDIA   Newspapers are even in worse shape, in many respects, than TV media.  Fewer people subscribe to weekday newspapers, today, than those who subscribed, in 1970.  And that is despite the fact the country's total population is almost 40 percent higher than it was in 1970.   And the pace of the decline of newspapers actually is accelerating.  Since 1992, in fact, and even without adjusting for population increases, newspaper circulation has declined 11 percentage points; nearly one point per year.  (The data can be accessed  urlLink here .)  Big media is dying.  In many respects, their decline parallels the Democratic Party, of which they most certainly are part and parcel.  The media is loud, angry, and shrill.  Indeed.  There's a reason for that.  You've just read about it.  Cornered and wounded animals are very fierce as well.

       Ike   Average unemployment rate in 1955 = 4.4 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1956 = 4.15 percent.  Percentage decrease in unemployment rate: Year three of first term to July of year four = 5.68 percent.    Result: Ike wins, in a vast landslide.    Nixon    Average unemployment rate in 1971 = 5.9 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1972 = 5.71 percent.  Percentage decrease in unemployment rate: Year three of first term to July of year four = 3.22 percent.     Result: Nixon wins, 49 out of 50 states.     Carter    Average unemployment rate in 1979 = 5.8 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1980 = 6.95 percent.  Result: Carter loses, in a vast electoral landslide. Oddly enough, however, 49 percent of the electorate votes for someone other than the winning candidate.   Reagan    Average unemployment rate in 1983 = 9.6 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1984 = 7.63 percent.  Percentage decrease in unemployment rate: Year three of first term to July of year four = 20.52 percent.     Result: Reagan wins, 49 out of 50 states.     Bush 41    Average unemployment rate in 1991 = 6.8 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1992 = 7.51 percent.  Result: Bush loses, in a vast electoral landslide. Oddly enough, however, 57 percent of the electorate votes against the winning candidate.   Clinton   Average unemployment rate in 1995 = 5.6 percent. Average rate: January - July, 1996 = 5.51 percent.  Percentage decrease in unemployment rate: Year three of first term to July of year four = 1.60 percent.     Result: Saint Bill wins, in a vast electorate vote landslide.     Bush 43    Average unemployment rate in 2003 = 6.0 percent. Average rate: January - July, 2004 = 5.6 percent.  Percentage decrease in unemployment rate: Year three of first term to July of year four = 6.66 percent.     Result: Bush wins, in a vast electoral landslide.

      So, for those of you who want to know what  actually  occurred in the labor markets, last month, as opposed to the almost laugh-out-loud gloom and doom headlines by the Kael-ish "mainstream media," here it is:  1) The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, from 5.6 percent.  2) Total employment rose by 629,000 last month. Of that total, 32,000 were W-2 positions and the rest -- 597,000 -- were non-payroll gains (which would include 1099 contractor/consultant positions, per diem positions, and self-employment).  3) For non-managerial employees in the services sectors, and for production workers in manufacturing, all of the following components of their employment increased: (1) hourly earnings (to $15.70, from $15.65), (2) weekly earnings (to $529.09, from $525.84), and the length of their workweeks. In other words, these people are now working longer hours and making more money, per hour, than they were 30 days prior.

      One of the more baffling ironies of this election is the self-perpetuating conundrum of duplicity, in which the far left finds itself, concerning John Kerry's military record. On the one hand, the far left, as always, has a knee-jerk disdain for the military and vehemently opposes the use of force. On the other hand, they've succeeded in nominating a man who's virtually built his entire candidacy around a short stint in combat.  How do they sleep with themselves?  Now, having said that, let's put aside the issue of hypocrisy for a moment. And let's also put aside the very serious questions that have arisen regarding the nature of Senator Kerry's military record (a topic for another time and, frankly, for another blog).  There's something very basic that needs to be asked, from a pure political viewpoint:  From what parallel universe did the far left get the idea that John Kerry was a viable national general election candidate because he served in the military, and, specifically, in combat?  Or, to put it another way:   George McGovern   McGovern was a decorated WWII hero, who flew  urlLink combat missions  with the U.S. Army Air Force, in the European theatre. In his political career, however, he lost two major elections: (1) the 1980 race for his U.S. Senate seat, and (2) of course, his notorious landslide defeat for the Presidency at the hands of Richard Nixon, in which Nixon won 49 out of 50 states and over 60 percent of the popular vote.   Bob Dole   Dole was a  urlLink highly-decorated WWII hero  who nearly was killed in combat while fighting for the U.S. Army in the Italian campaign. He was blown out by non-serving Bill Clinton in 1996, however, failing to garner even 41 percent of the total vote.   Richard Nixon   Nixon did not serve in combat, a la Dole or McGovern or even Kerry. But he too provides a very obvious example of the complete disconnent between military service and major electoral success or failure.  Nixon was a  urlLink Navy Officer during WWII . He received various commendations for his service and the unit over which he was commander operated in the Solomons, in which some of the most vicious fighting of the Pacific campaign -- e.g., Guadalcanal -- occurred.  Nixon  urlLink lost two major elections  during his career: (a) the 1960 Presidential race, and (b) the 1962 contest for the Governorship of his home state of California. On the other hand, though, Nixon won two major elections in his career -- the 1968 and 1972 Presidential races (the latter of which against a combat veteran) -- and was the VP for Dwight Eisenhower's back-to-back landslide victories, in, respectively, the 1952 and 1956 Presidential races.  Did the left actually think this through?  Or are they so blind in their hatred of Bush, and so demented by the stunning loss of political power to which they have been subjected, since 1980, that they literally can't think straight?

      Since June 1st, Newsweek Magazine has taken two national "polls." On average, John Kerry is pulling 51.5 percent.  NBC News had Kerry at 54 percent, on July 6th.  ABC News has been involved with three separate "polls" over the past two months. On average, they have Kerry at 50 percent.  (Data  urlLink here .)  What freakin' planet are they on???  There have been 13 Presidential elections, since WWII, in which someone has challeged an incumbent Prez or an incumbent VP. And this slate of challengers has included three decorated combat heroes (Kennedy, McGovern, Dole); former elected Vice Presidents (Nixon, Mondale); a former, multi-term Senate Majority Leader (Dole); and Governors from several of the nation's most populous states (Dewey, Carter, Reagan, Bushitler).  And you know what?  The largest total ever pulled by  any of them  was . . . drum roll . . .  50.7 percent of the popular vote.  Fifty-point-seven percent.  By Reagan, in 1980, against Jimmy Carter.  And that, of course, was in a period of  urlLink double-digit inflation  and  urlLink 7-plus percent unemployment .  Now, however, we have inflation at roughly 3 percent (see above link) and unemployment is at  urlLink 5.6 percent .  Furthermore, the average share of the popular vote take for these challengers, in those 13 elections, spanning the course of 56 years, is . . . . .  44.2 percent.  Sitting U.S. Senators have pulled, on average, 41.55 percent.  Northeasterners have pulled, on average, 46.75 percent.  So, the notion of a liberal Senator from the Northeast pulling an outright majority of the popular vote -- against a sitting President who is presiding over falling unemployment and benign inflation -- is so patently frivolous, so ludicrous, in fact, as to border on outright LU-NA-CY!!!  Kael Syndrome on Nov. 3rd!  Note: Electoral data  urlLink here .

      Dem Gains:  Illinois.  GOP Gains:  Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, North Carolina, South Dakota.  Toss Ups:  Alaska, Colorado.  Most Likely Scenario:  GOP picks up three net seats.  Dem Party degenerates into outright internecine warfare, following the outster of Daschle, and given the reality of George Bush -- with a popular mandate.

      Current outlook: Negative, bearish.  I believe the major averages still are grossly overvalued on all historical metrics, P/E, P/B, P/S, and dividend yield.   Ideal scenario:  A broad-based decline, taking the DOW back down to about 9,000 and the S&P down to about 1,000.  At that point, presumably, there would be sufficient bargains available across several equity sectors to put material money to work.  The broader markets, however, still would be overvalued, at least in my view.  Favorite current stock:  Washington Mutual (WM).   Dirt cheap.  High yield.  The largest S&L.  Plus a huge fee-based retail business.  Out of favor with Mr. Market.   What's not to like?

      After thumbing through  urlLink this article , it struck me:  Why is Kerry even campaigning in Iowa??  I mean, it's seven electoral votes, John.  Shouldn't you be in Ohio, or Missouri, or Wisconsin, or Florida?  Oh, right.  Kerry's campaigning in Iowa because he's probably behind or statistically tied in all seven of the states that Al Gore narrowly won, in 2000.  My bad.

      When those  urlLink two phrases  are in the  urlLink same sentence , well, then, it  has  to be a good night.  I'm not sure that the Sox even will make the postseason this year.  Anaheim and Oakland -- whichever does not win the West -- pose grave threats to the Sox's chances.  Oh, well.   1918.   That number will never change.

      So, it's about 10:45 p.m., on Wednesday, August 4th, Pacific Standard Time.  And the blog-o-sphere, of course, is uproarious over the Swift Boat 527's devastating ad against Kerry. So, I log onto MSNBC.com, to see how the "mainstream media" is spinning the news. And . . . And . . . And . . .  There's nothing to spin.  Literally!  MSNBC is not even reporting it.  Hmm. I wonder why?  Then, another thing strikes me.  One of their "top stories" over on MSNBC, right now, is "Washington judge OKs same-sex marriages."  But, on the other hand, there's literally no mention, in the "top stories" section, of the  urlLink landslide passage , earlier today, of an outright ban on gay marriage, in the so-called "swing state" of Missouri.  Hmm.  Oh, well, no biggie, I guess. I mean, only  71 percent  of Missouri  voters  wanted to ban gay marriage in  their state . Obviously, it's much more "newsworthy" to talk about what some judge wants to do elsewhere. And, as we all know, in the mind's eye of the "mainstream media," forty percentage-point margins in favor of conservative ballot measures -- for example, 64-23 polling in favor of banning affirmative action in Michigan -- are tantamount merely to " urlLink slim majorities ."

      I've blogged numerous times, both  urlLink here  and on  urlLink Polipundit.com , about the direct relationship between consumer confidence and election results.  The most important factor that plays into the level of consumers' (and therefore voters') confidence is, of course, the job market. Above all else, when companies are hiring, and layoffs are tame, and job security abounds, and new jobs are available, people, in general, and the people that actually decide elections, specifically, feel good about their personal financial conditions. And when regular Americans feel good about their personal financial conditions, incumbent Presidents not only win, they win by vast landslide margins. Yes, theoretically, there could be circumstances under which an incumbent Prez might lose a re-election bid, even in the midst of a good job market. It's just that that's never happened. Ever! And we've had Presidents win re-election bids or successive terms because of good job markets, even during periods of: (a) immense racial strife (LBJ), (b) costly, unpopular wars (Nixon), (c) Cold War tensions (Reagan), and (d) foreign and internal bombings, sieges, and terrorist attacks (Clinton).  The other major component of how mainstream Americans view their financial situations is inflation. Inflation directly affects purchasing power. In periods of high inflation, people see the value of their wages diminished, their ability to purchase things hindered, and the profitability of their businesses degraded. High inflation means less confidence on the part of consumers and, from a political standpoint, less confidence amongst voters.  Until oil prices started getting out of hand lately, we did not hear much if anything about inflation from the partisan-liberal/Democratic media.  That's not surprising.  They've done their homework.  In the modern political era (post-WWII), only one President -- Bush 41 --  ever  has lost a re-election bid while presiding over  urlLink benign inflation  (click on "CPI Inflation Calculator"). In every other instance, low inflation meant a landslide win for the incumbent President, and high inflation meant defeat. And, regarding Bush 41, keep in mind, however, that he was presiding over a horrible job market ( urlLink 7.5 percent  average unemployment rate -- in 1992); there was a third-party candidate who siphoned nearly 20 percent of the popular vote; and, despite all those headwinds, Bush 41 still took 18 states outright, and a grand total of 57 percent of the country voted  against  Bill Clinton.  So, no, it's not surprising that the media forgot about inflation until they found another meme -- oil and gas prices -- with which to try to get Kerry elected. Unfortunately, for them, the chapter on inflation for this coming election already has been written, and the media and their Democratic bretheren already have lost.  We are coming off historically-low inflation levels. And, even with the spike in oil prices, inflation still is very tame by historical standards.  In fact, George W. Bush has presided over the lowest level of overall inflation than any sitting President, who sought election to a successive term, since Lyndon Johnson, back in 1964. Furthermore, a measure of comparative rates of inflation, even during the two-year periods immediately preceding a bid for re-election, still leaves President Bush in very fine shape. From 2003 to this year, total inflation is: (1) lower than the prevailing rate during the comparable period in Reagan's first term (3.10% - 4.32%); (2) lower than the prevailing rate in the salient time frame in Nixon's first term (3.21%); and (3) almost equivalent to the prevailing inflation rate during the comparable period of Clinton's first term (2.95%).  And, looking ahead, inflation is not going anywhere special over the next couple of months. In fact, there are indications that it's already peeked, for the year, and  urlLink is in the process of declining . Finally, here are the raw stats for inflation and the corresponding levels of electoral success, or failure, for sitting Presidents:  Ike  Total inflation in first term = 1.87% (0.46% average annual rate) Won re-election in a landslide (over 450 electoral votes)  LBJ  Total inflation in first term = 3.68% (0.92% average annual rate) Won re-election in a landslide (61.5 percent of the popular vote)  Nixon  Total inflation in first term = 13.90% (3.47% average annual rate) Won re-election in a landslide (49 out of 50 states)  Ford*  Total inflation in first term = 28.15% (7.04% average annual rate) Lost election bid by narrow margin (a shift of less than 50,000 votes would have given him the Electoral College)  Carter  Total inflation in first term = 35.97% (8.99% average annual rate) [Yikes!] Lost re-election bid in a landslide (Reagan won 44 states)  Reagan  Total inflation in first term = 14.30% (3.57% average annual rate) Won re-election in a landslide (49 out of 50 states)  Bush 41  Total inflation in first term = 13.15% (3.29% average annual rate) Lost re-election bid in a three-party plurality contest (Clinton won a bare majority in only one state: Arkansas)  Clinton  Total inflation in first term = 8.58% (2.14% average annual rate) Won re-election in a landslide (379 electoral votes)  Bush 43  Total inflation in first term = 7.11% (1.78% average annual rate)  Note: *Ford, obviously, took over for Agnew and then for Nixon, upon their respective resignations. Ford presided over high inflation leading up to his bid for the 1976 election. Merely from 1975-1976, inflation came in at an annualized rate of 5.76 percent.

      Well, in that event, and instead of all the media cheerleading about the so-called "greatest economy ever," you might have seen the following headlines blaring across the top folds of your "news"papers:  1)  "Average hourly and weekly earnings fall in February"  2)  "Economy drops 9,000 jobs in April"  3)  "U.S. loses another 46,000 jobs in May"  4)  "Job growth weak: economy adds only 6,000 new positions"  * * * 5)  "Manufacturing sector loses 4,000 jobs in April"  6)  "4,000 more jobs vanish from manufacturing sector in June"  7)  "Manufacturing sector hit hard once again; 27,000 additional jobs lost in July"  8)  "282,000 manufacturing workers have lost their jobs over the past 14 months"  9)  "Economy drops 35,000 jobs in September"  10) "Average weekly earnings decline by 1.2 percent last month"  Folks, all of these mock headlines represent actual, historical events.   And all of those events took place in:   1995  and  1996 .  Shocking, huh?   (Note: the raw data can be accessed  urlLink here .)

      "Wages under George Bush grow faster than corresponding wage growth during same period in Clinton's first term."  Nope.  You'll never see that one . . . in this lifetime.   At least not in any "news"paper that you might pick up and peruse.  However, that's the objective truth!  Check this out:   June 30, 1996   Year-over-year wage growth (inflation adjusted):  Business sector: + 0.9 percent Nonfarm business sector: + 0.9 percent Manufacturing sector: + 0.9 percent  On the other hand:   June 30, 2004   Year-over-year wage growth (inflation adjusted):  Business sector: + 1.7 percent Nonfarm business sector: + 1.9 percent Manufacturing sector: + 3.0 percent  Shocking, huh?

Um, no.  That's the amount of net W-2 payroll jobs that the economy has created . . . over the past seven months!!!  (Note: See  urlLink here  (Table A - Estabishment Data - Nonfarm employment) and then go  urlLink here  (Table A - Establishment Data - Nonfarm employment). Subtract the number of payrolls for December 2003 from the corresponding number for July 2004.

      Within the parlance of labor economics, there is a specific meaning to the term "discouraged worker." No, it does not mean someone who hates their job.  A "discouraged worker" -- in a labor market analysis -- is someone who had been looking for work, within the prior 12 month period, but who gave up and stopped looking altogether, within the prior month, because they came to the conclusion that there were no jobs available for them. In other words, they're persons who tried to find suitable work but were unsuccessful -- due to a lack of jobs, not to a lack of effort or skills on their part.  So, how many "discouraged workers" do you think there are at present? I mean, the way the media keeps telling us how people are "hurting" and how much "economic angst" there is, the figure must be staggering, right? 5 million? 10 million?  Um, no.  483,000.  Yep.  In between January 1, 2004 and July 31, 2004, the number of "discouraged workers" in the economy averaged 483,000. Roughly the same amount as the population of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Less than half the population of San Jose, California.  And, check this out:   1996  - Jan. 1st - July 31st  Average total workforce = 133.519 million. Average number of discouraged workers = 415,000. Discouraged workers as a percentage of total workforce =  0.31 percent.    2004  - Jan. 1st - July 31st  Average total workforce = 146.976 million. Average number of discouraged workers = 483,000. Discouraged workers as a percentage of total workforce =  0.33 percent.   Hmm.  The greatest economy ever vs. the second Great Depression.  Right?

       Presidential Race   Bush - 57 Kerry - 42 Nader - 1   U.S. Senate   GOP picks up a net gain of 3 seats*   U.S. House   GOP picks up 7-12 seats   Governorships   GOP picks up two seats; Missouri and Indiana.  Note:* Pete Coors' impressive showing in last week's primary, and the level of GOP turnout, specifically, lead me to conclude that that seat is trending heavily towards a retention for the GOP. As such, I am leaning towards upping my prediction to a net GOP gain of 4 Senate seats. My earlier (and still-current) prediction of a 3 seat gain was premised on the notion that the Democrats easily could win  both  Colorado and Alaska. After the Colorado Senate primary election, however, I believe that is a serious long shot.

       Stock Marke  t     Assessment: negative.  I believe the stock market is too expensive (overvalued) under any objective set of criteria.  While the recent selling is welcome, it is not sufficient, in my view, to warrant a substantial investment into stocks.  If the S&P 500 falls all the way down to 1,000, then, perhaps, one could argue that a broad investment in stocks would be justified, albeit only from a technical standpoint.  If, on the other hand, the S&P were to crash, and in the process go all the way down to 800, then, yes, I would argue that it was cheap; and I would then be very willing generally to invest in stocks -- with impunity.

      The perma-meme for this year's Presidential race is that we have a "bitterly divided electorate," and that the race will go down to the wire.  And there's no faction more willing to remind people of this concept than the media.  Of course, the media has a vested interest in selling the public on the idea of a "close race."  If people believe it will be a close race, they'll be more apt to tune into political coverage and, of course, to the "polls."  And that means more money for them.  Remember folks: viewers and readers = advertising revenue for them.  Then, there's the nervous/fickle right.   For obvious reasons, the media wants Bush out and Kerry in.  And they are well aware that, if conservatives actually vote, in large numbers, Kerry has no chance.  So, part of the reason for the "close race" meme is to depress turnout among the fickle, nervous right.  These are people who almost search for reasons not to vote.  If the media can get enough of them to believe that Bush will not win, that will result in many of them giving up and staying home.  The media wants a self-fulfilling prophecy, in other words.  In any event, what are the real chances that this contest actually will be close?  Slim to none.  Item No. 1  Not including the 2000 election, there have been 13 Presidential contests since the end of WWII.  Four of those other elections -- 1948, 1960, 1968, 1976 -- were extremely close.  In each instance, however, the very next election was a monumental landslide.  Ike blew away Stevenson in 1952.  LBJ obliterated Goldwater in 1964 (winning over 61 percent of the vote).  Nixon destroyed McGovern in 1972 (winning 49 out of 50 states).  And Reagan annihilated Carter in 1980 (winning 44 states and a 10-point margin of victory in the popular vote).  Item No. 2  There is a fundamental difference between Presidential contests involving incumbent Presidents and those involving Vice Presidents, or, on the other hand, open races.  Over the past 56 years, only two sitting Presidents have been involved in close elections: Harry Truman, in 1948, and Gerald Ford, in 1976.  In each other instance, the President either won in a monumental landslide (1956, 1964, 1972, 1984, 1996), or they lost in a landslide (1980, 1992).  Not surprisingly, neither Truman nor Ford were elected Presidents.  Vice President Truman, of course, took over for FDR upon the latter's death.  And Ford?  Ford was not even an elected VP.  He was appointed to fill the VP slot, upon the scandal-charged resignation of Spiro Agnew.  Then, he succeeded to the Presidency upon the resignation of Nixon.  As of November 1976, Ford never had been elected to anything other than a Congressional District.  And he  still  almost won the election.  In fact, if there were such a thing as GOP grass roots efforts, back then, he likely would have won the Electoral College.   Item No. 3  The 2000 election was a fluke.  A confluence of factors that are not likely  ever  to be repeated again.   First, we were in the midst of the most speculative asset bubble (tech/telecom stocks) in our entire history.  Second, there was a late hit on the leading candidate that actually caused a material amount of voters to stay home.  Finally, the leading candidate stopped campaigning almost a week before election day.   Folks, that's not going to happen again.  And Bush is the incumbent.  And Kerry is a bad candidate.  Yes, it's  possible  that the race will be close.  I wouldn't bet on it, however.  And, frankly, there's a way for conservatives to make this whole issue moot:  On Nov. 2nd, regardless of what the "polls" say, and irrespective of how loud Chris Matthews and Gloria Borger are yelling at you to not bother, because Kerry has "won" . . .  VOTE!!!

      American Research Group recently conducted a "poll," in which they stated that the race between George Bush and John Kerry, in the alleged "battleground" state of Iowa, was literally  urlLink a dead heat: 47-47 .  There's something about this "poll" that seems odd to me.  According to American Research Group, they sampled slightly more Democrats than Republicans (35-34), and 31 percent of their sample were "not registered with any party or registered with a minor party." They do not, however, break down what portion of their sample were registered independents, as opposed to registered Greens (i.e., "minor party" members).  Hmm. That's odd.  According to Iowa's  urlLink Secretary of State , as of August 1, 2004, there were more registered, active  Republicans  than registered, active Democrats in Iowa (31.56-30.91). Moreoever, 37.52 percent of Iowans were registered independents, and there were only 81 registered, active Green Party members in the entire state (out of a registered electorate of almost 2 million people).  I'm getting the feeling that American Research Group just fudged the sample population for this "poll," until they wound up exactly with what they wanted: a ratings-enhancing "dead heat" to publish to hopeful Democrats and to nervous Republicans.

      For those of you unfamiliar with Northern California, Contra Costa County lies just to the north and to the east of Berkeley.  It has two large liberal bastions: the City of Martinez and the City of Richmond. It is heavily Democratic, both by registration and by voting patterns. Last Fall, in the Recall Election, for example, Contra Costa County actually voted to keep Gray Davis in office; by a margin of 13 points, no less.  The other day, however, the voters of Contra Costa County  urlLink rejected a proposed tax increase  that would have funded nature-related projects (e.g., parks) and other environmental causes.  This echoes the voting behaviour of "progressive" Washington State, in which the electorate has a long and checkered history of voting down taxing and spending programs; often by landslide margins. (See  urlLink here .)  Hmm.  It's amazing, is is not, just how conservative Democrats and liberals get when, as opposed to sending off someone to Washington, D.C., to ruin other people's lives, their votes actually have a direct impact on their own wallets and pocketbooks?  Or, to borrow a phrase from a Web buddy of mine, Ras -- a commentator on the Polipundit.com web site:  "Liberalism for thee, but not for me."

      Oregon has 7 electoral votes.  In 2000, Al Gore won the state by a fraction of one percent.  And that was with Pat Buchanan on the ballot, to the right of George Bush.   Check this out:  Total number of Registered Democrats (5/04): 727,347 Total ballots cast in May 2004 Democratic Presidential primary: 368,544 Total ballots cast in favor of John Kerry: 289,804  * * *  Total number of Registered Republicans (5/04): 675,931 Total GOP ballots cast in May 2004 Presidential primary: 309,506 Total ballots cast in favor of George W. Bush: 293,806  So, in other words:  1) Literally half of the Registered Democrats in Oregon did not bother even to vote in their Party's contested primary election,  2) More than 20 percent of the Democrats who voted in their primary cast their ballots  against  John Kerry,  3) George Bush outpolled Kerry, in total votes, and took a much higher percentage (95.5 - 78.6) of his nominating base's primary ballot support.  They're just motivated like hell over on the Democratic side of the aisle, right?  Note: Raw data is  urlLink here .

      Remember that "economic slowdown" in June?  Yep.  The gloom and doom headlines.  The posturing by the left.  The not-so-subtle desire for the economy to tank.  Remember it well, my friends. Because it's aready gone and forgotten.  The economy merely paused, and is now surging once again.   urlLink Retail Sales   1) In July, retail sales increased 0.7 percent from their levels in June. 2) Compared to July 2003, last month's retail sales were up 6.5 percent (which is huge!). 3) That "plunge" in the level of May-June retail sales, which the media beat over our heads last month, actually was not a plunge at all. The decline was revised to half-a-percent (0.5), from the initial, reported figure of minus 1.1 percent.   urlLink Jobless Claims   1) Initial jobless claims fell sharply last week. 2) The four-week average dropped substantially. 3) On a workforce-adjusted basis, the pace of layoffs, right now, is (a) slower that it was at this same point in Clinton's first term, (b) slower than it was at this point in Reagan's first term, and (c) slower than it was at this point in Nixon's first term.  For example, as of August 10, 1996, the four-week average of first-time jobless claims was 329,000. The total workforce was 134 million. So, therefore, initial jobless claims were equivalent to 0.245 percent of the workforce.  As of August, 7, 2004, however, the four-week average of first-time jobless claims was 339,250. The total workforce, right now, is 148 million. So, therefore, under George Bush, initial jobless claims are merely 0.230 percent of the workforce.  Yes, you read that correctly: when population increases are taken into account, fewer people are being laid off from their jobs, right now, than were being laid off under Saint Bill Clinton, during the comparable period in his re-election campaign.  Amazing, huh?  (Note: for the raw data underlying the historical comparison of jobless claims, see  urlLink here  (level of jobless claims) and  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  (size of workforce).)

      It will be close.  Pete Coors is not an ideal candidate.  Salazar is a tough guy, and, as a sitting AG, arguably has almost full incumbency advantages.  However, Coors has off-the-charts name recognition.  And Salazar's ballot take in the Dem primary was dwarfed by Coors' take in the GOP primary.  In that regard, Coors was running in a race that, allegedly, was a "dead heat."  (See below for how preposterously-wrong those pre-election polling prognostications turned out.)  On the other hand, Salazar was, in essence, unopposed.  That is not a good sign for Salazar.   Yes, his wide lead arguably could have suppressed his turnout.  But, nevertheless, he should have been much, much closer to Coors, in the aggregate vote tally.  Bush won the state in 2000; against a two-term incumbent VP.  The GOP has an edge in voter registration.  And Bush now is the incumbent, running against a liberal, Northeastern Senator. Salazar has to share his ballot with the latter.  Coors gets to share his ballot with the former.  As such, I believe that Coors has the edge.  He  should  win the race, 51-49.

       Pennsylvania   As of April 2004, there were 3,622,410 Registered Democrats in the Keystone State.  Why do I mention that?  Well, oddly enough, only 787,034 of them (less than 22 percent) bothered to vote in the Democratic Party's primary election this year.  Hmm. Must be a really "motivated" electorate, huh?  Oh, wait. I know. The depressed turnout must have been because Kerry already had the nomination wrapped up.  Right?  Well, George W. Bush obviously was unopposed in this year's GOP primaries. And he pulled 858,490 votes.  So, Bush outpolled the entire Democratic field . . . by nine percentage points . . . running in an uncontested primary.  Hmm.   New Hampshire   Another of those "bitterly divided" "swing states" about which the liberal media is preoccupied.  In 2000, voters in the Granite State cast a grand total of 569,081 ballots, of which 266,348 went for Al Gore.  And, of course, New Hampshire was the site of the very first primary for this year's Democratic Party nomination contest.  And the media kept telling us how "motivated" the Democratic base was, remember?  Yep.  They were so "motivated" that only 220,982 Democratic primary votes were cast . . . combined!  Almost 21 percent less than what Al Gore pulled, as a two-term incumbent VP, running during a period of historically-low unemployment.  Hmm.   Ohio   As of this year, there are 7,204,856 registered voters in Ohio.  Al Gore received 2,186,190 votes, in 2000.  Oddly enough, however, only 1,202,014 votes were cast in this year's Democratic primaries.  A 45 percent drop off from the Democratic ballots cast in the 2000 general election.  And how about George Bush?  Running in an uncontested primary, he pulled 777,972 votes, or 65 percent of what was cast for the  entire Democratic field .  Hmm.   Wisconsin   In 2000, Wisconsin voters cast, in the aggregate, 2,598,607 votes; of which 1,242,987 went to Al Gore.  And Wisconsin had one of the earlier primary elections this year. In fact, that was the state in which Howard ("Scream") Dean was to make his final stand, remember?  Strangely enough, the entire Democratic primary field pulled only 828,350 votes. That's a drop off of one third, from Al Gore's take. And it's less than a third of the total number of votes that were cast in the "bitterly divided" year-2000 general election.  Hmm.   Minnestota     There are a grand total of 2,876,891 registered voters in Minnesota. However, only 51,518 votes (1.8 percent -- one.point.eight) were cast in this year's Democratic Presidential primary contest . . . in the aggregate!  Hmm.  Note: For the raw data, see  urlLink here  (Pennsylvania),  urlLink here  (New Hampshire),  urlLink here  (Ohio),  urlLink here  (Wisconsin), and  urlLink here  (Minnestota).

      Washington State voted for Gore in 2000.  It voted for Clinton.  It voted -- ahem -- for Dukakis!  It's one of those "progressive" states with which the media is smitten.  So, conservatives have no power at the ballot box there, right?  Wrong!  The State of Washington provides classic examples of two ironic political phenomenon: (1) what happens when conservative-minded people actually go to the polls and vote, instead of allowing their pet peeves to result in self-disenfranchisement, and (2) what the political landscape will look like, once the FDR/New Deal vote-by-rote bloc is gone (RIP), and the country has completed the historic political re-alignment in which it currently is engaged.   Proposition 200 - Anti-Affirmative Action Referendum    In November 1998, the people of the State of Washington were asked the following question: "Shall government be prohibited from discriminating or granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting?"  One of those anti-racial preference measures, huh?  Well, this is "progressive" Washington. So, the measure failed, right?  Wrong!  The measure to ban "affirmative action" was approved . . .  by 17 percentage points !   Proposition 696 - Anti-Commercial Fishing Measure   In November 1999, a far-left environmental measure made it to the ballot in the Evergreen State. Voters were asked whether they wanted to abolish commercial fishing in Washington's territorial waters, other than in connection with tribal fisheries, conducted under rights of treaties.  Well, this is "progressive" Washington. So, the measure must have passed, or the vote total must at least have been close?  Nope.  The initiative to bar commercial fishing went down to a flaming defeat. It lost by  21 percentage points !   Proposition 722 - Anti-Tax Measure   Measure 722 was on the November 2000 ballot. It was an anti-tax initiative.  Evergreen State voters were asked whether they wanted to exempt vehicles from property tax assessments and whether they wanted to set a hard cap on future property tax increases. They also were asked whether they wanted to rescind various taxes and fees that were imposed the prior year.  The voters responded: "Yeah, that would be a pretty freakin' good idea."  The anti-tax measure was approved . . .  by 12 percentage points !   Referendum 51 - Taxing and Spending Initiative   In 2002, Washington State's liberal Legislature pushed through various public transportation improvements that were to be financed, not surprisingly, by tax increases. They wanted to pay for their eager spending on infrastructure by: raising gasoline taxes, raising vehicle sales taxes, and, of course, by imposing additional vehicle fees.  Public Referendum No. 51 was on the November 2002 ballot. Voters were asked a simple question: whether they wanted to approve their Legislature's taxing and spending plans. In other words, they were asked whether they wanted to agree to self-taxation in exchange for improvements to their public transportation systems.  The voters responded: "We don't want no stinkin' taxes."  The voting margin?  Twenty-three percentage points !  There are two morals to these stories.  First, the above-referenced ballot results demonstrate, yet again, what happens when conservative-minded people actually go to the polls and vote; as opposed to letting themselves be snookered into not voting by the partisan-liberal media, or engaging in self-disenfranchisement in order to "send a message" to the GOP establishment, or as "payback" for some personal pet peeve.  Even in a so-called "liberal" state, like Washington, conservatives can exercise enormous power; provided, of course, that they  choose to do so .  Second, in Washington State, as is the case elsewhere, there is an obvious disconnent between voting patters in partisan, candidate-based elections and voting patterns on issue-specific referendums and other ballot initiatives. But, in an ironic twist, this is the very essence of the massive political re-alignment that is taking place throughout the country, and which has been accelerating, in fact, since 1994.  One of the primary reasons for the dichotomy between referendum voting and political party voting is the FDR/New Deal vote-by-rote bloc. This is a material percentage of the electorates in all the states, not merely Washington. It consists of blue-collar, middle-class persons who automatically, reflexively, and religiously vote for the "Democrat" over the "Republican." They literally never have voted for a Republican in their lives. They voted for Mondale in 1984. They voted for Dukakis in 1988. For God's sake, they even voted for McGovern in 1972. And here's the catch: many of them not only are not liberal, on the issues, they are  deeply-conservative .  Hence, when voters in Washington State, for example, are given the labels of "Democrat" or "Republican" from which to choose, they tend to vote for the "Democrat," often by large margins. In fact, no GOP Presidential nominee has carried Washington State since 1984.  However, when the name plates are removed, and issues are at the forefront, Evergreen State voters not only can vote for conservative positions, or against liberal positions, they actually do so; often by landslide margins.  This is why the left wing has become so hateful and so desperate. Their parent company, the Democratic Party, loses votes each and every day. The FDR/New Deal vote-by-rote bloc passes on. And, for obvious reasons, those voters simply cannot be replaced. Over time, this country has moved, and will continue to move, towards much more of an issue-driven electorate, as opposed to one that automatically votes for a label, regardless of the positions for which that label stands.  There is empirical evidence for this. Only 15 years ago, the GOP had merely 18 Governorships. Now? The GOP controls 28 out of 50, including those of the four largest states in the Union. Sixty-one percent of the country's populace now lives under GOP Gubernatorial command.  Furthermore, the Democratic Party used to pull overwhelming majorities of the votes cast in U.S. House races. Those majorities steadily declined over the Reagan years and then in the 1990's. In the very last election cycle, the GOP won an outright majority of those votes; the first time that's happened since the 1950's.  The voting patters on ballot referendums in "liberal Washington State" are not flukes, nor are they one-time events. They represent the shape of things to come.  The only things that stand in the way of complete conservative political dominance are conservatives themselves.  If they vote, conservative positions will prevail. If they vote for the conservative political party, the GOP, conservative positions will have a chance to be implemented on a national scale.  If, on the other hand, they continue to stay home -- in candidate-based elections -- well, then, more of the same old, same old.  The choice is for conservatives to make.  And for conservatives only.  (Note: The raw data for the Washington State ballot voting is  urlLink here .)

      The Governator's job approval rating is at  urlLink 65 percent ; despite continued, scorched-Earth campaigns against him by the Golden State's partisan-liberal media, e.g., the LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Sacramento Bee, and the San Jose Mercury News.  Plus, since this is a "poll," imagine what the actual numbers are -- 67.5 percent, maybe 70 percent?  Anyway, if I were Dianne Feinstein or Barbara Boxer (assuming she beats Bill Jones this year, as expected), I'd be wringing my hands, biting my polished nails, and getting all gloomy. If either of those two wing nuts faced Arnold, somewhere down the line, not only would they lose that election, they would lose by such a preposterous margin (for a multi-term incumbent, that is), it would set their local DNC operations back a decade or so.

      Another bad day for the partisan media, partisan Democrats, and reality-denying liberals:   Wage Growth (nominal) - July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2004   Services sectors: + 4.6 percent Services sectors (minus farming): + 4.8 percent Manufacturing sectors: + 5.9 percent   Wage Growth (inflation adjusted) - July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2004   Services sectors: + 1.7 percent Services sectors (minus farming): + 1.9 percent Manufacturing sectors: + 3.0 percent   Productivity (output per hour)   Services sectors: + 4.1 percent Services sectors (minus farming): + 4.7 percent Manufacturing sectors: + 6 percent  Hmm.  Over the past year, American workers have been substantially more productive, their hourly wages have increased, and, to top it off, those wage increases have outstripped inflation.  Cue the theme music for the Grapes of Wrath, then. Obviously, it must be another "Great Depression."  Right?  Note: Data  urlLink here .

      Michael Moore's Democratic soft money hit piece is off the radar screen.  F-9/11 did not finish in the top-10 for last weekend's box office. In fact, it drew less in the way of receipts than such luminaries as "Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle."  And, of course, how much of its prior box office "success" actually consisted of Moveon-affiliated liberal groups buying up tickets, with Democratic blood money, and then just handing those tickets out, for free, to liberal college brats?  In any event, all of this finally is moot. This small footnote in the country's political history is now just water down the sewer.  (See  urlLink here  for the box office data.)

      More  urlLink circulation fraud  from a major publisher of newspapers.  And, believe you me, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  * * *  On a different, but related, topic, USA Today listed, in their report on the above-referenced fraud, the claimed daily circulation figures for the country's 20 largest newspapers.  Now, before we analyze these figures, from a political standpoint, let's start with the irony of the numbers: they're bunk!  Circulation fraud is an epidemic in the publishing industry. Newspaper publishers engage in such fraud to artificially increase their advertising revenue. Sometimes the fraud is intentional. Other times, it falls somewhere between negligent misrepresentations and a half-truths.  The ways in which print media companies engage in circulation fraud are as follows:  1) Failing to stop deliveries after subscribers call to cancel, and then reporting those papers as "circulation,"  2) Starting new deliveries, unilaterally, and for free, and then counting those papers as "circulation," even if the recipients immediately call to cancel (which many do),  3) Counting unread papers left in racks as "circulation."  Having said all of this, however, let's just take the numbers at face value for a moment.  In the aggregate, the 20 largest papers claim a total level of daily circulation of 19.5 million. Not surprisingly, about half of those papers are some of the most liberal outfits in media annals (e.g., NYT, WaPo, LAT, Philly Inquirer, Detroit News/Free Press, Boston Globe, etc.)  But, think about the raw numbers for a moment.  Less than 20 million papers!  Over 102 million people voted in 2000.  So, even assuming the level of turnout remains the same, big print media is reaching  less than 20 percent  of the electorate. And, perhaps even more significantly, the geographical areas, in which the largest circulation papers are being consumed, tend to have no political relevance whatsoever.  Only three of the papers (USA Today, WSJ, NYT) realistically can be considered "national" papers. The rest are regional, at best, or purely local. And the three "national" papers, combined, have a presumed daily audience of merely 6.4 million persons; which is far less than 10 percent of the total electorate. And one of those papers, the WSJ, has a conservative editorial bent, albeit a liberal hard news predilection.  Ten of the papers in question have their readership focused in states that are not politically competitive. Four of the other papers (Denver Post, Minneapolis Tribune, Newark Ledger, Arizona Republic) are in states that might be competetive, but which have little to no impact in the Electoral College.  Only two of the papers in question (Philly Inquirer and Detroit News/Free Press) have significant ties to states that could have independent electoral signficance this Fall. And, in that regard, their real significance inures to George Bush's sole advantage. Bush can win re-election without carrying either Michigan or Pennsylvania. Kerry, on the other hand, would have virtually no chance of winning the Electoral College, if he does not carry  both  of those states.  Simply put: big print media is just noise.  They're loud. They're sensational. But, ultimately, politically irrelevant!  Very much akin to the remnants of the Democratic Party, of which almost all of them are part and parcel.

      In addition to the three arch-conservative ballot referendums that were passed by California voters -- by landslide margins -- and which are discussed in an earlier post on this blog, there have been other recent examples of what happens when conservatives actually go to the polls and vote, as opposed to inventing picayune reasons to stay home or to engage in partial self-disenfranchisement:   California - 1994 - Proposition 186   This was a measure designed to implement a Canadian-style system of socialized medicine in California. Golden State voters rejected the overture . . .  urlLink by 46 percentage points !   California - 2000 - Proposition 22   This was a ballot referendum to reiterate that gay marriage is illegal in California, and to bar any recognition of same-sex marriages by California's sister states.  This ban on gay marriage was approved . . .  urlLink by 23 percentage points (61.5-38.5) !  Hmm. "Liberal California," huh?   Oregon - Measure 30 - February 2004   Oregon ran into a budget problem last year. So, the Legislature decided unilaterally to raise taxes to cover the state's deficit. Well, that did not sit too well with voters in the Beaver State.  A ballot referendum was held last February. Oregon voters had a crystal clear choice: (1) agree to raise taxes on themselves, or (2) face 544 million dollars in budget cuts; including, $300 million in spending cuts for public school programs and nearly $200 million in spending cuts for public health care services.  No contest.  The voters rejected the tax increases . . .  urlLink by 20 percentage points !  "Liberal Oregon," huh?   Missouri - Gay Marriage Referendum - August 2004     Ah, Missouri. One of the "bitterly divided" "swing states" over which the media keeps hyperventilating.  Last week, the Show Me State had their primary elections. And, furthermore, they were asked a question regarding gay marriage. The question was very simple: Do Missourians want to ban gay marriage or not ban it.  The voters responded: We want gay marriage banned. And they did so by a margin of  urlLink over 40 percentage points !  Hmm.  Four separate ballot measures. Three separate issues. Three distinct states; two of which are allegedly "liberal." Four separate election cycles. Spanning the course of 10 years. But all within the past 10 years.  And, in all four instances, the conservative viewpoint prevailed. Not only prevailed, but prevailed by utter landslide margins!  So, in conclusion:  Yes, it is a "bitterly divided electorate."  Conservatives have complete dominance at the polls,  when they choose to exercise that dominance .  And, of course, regarding their complete lack of political power, liberals certainly are bitter!

      So, it's a "bitterly divided electorate," huh?  Yep.  The GOP controls:  (1) The White House (for 24 of the past 35 years),  (2) A majority in the U.S. House of Representatives (since 1994, consecutively),  (3) A majority in the U.S. Senate (for 9 of the past 10 years),  (4) A majority (56 percent) of the State Governorships, including: California (for 16 of the past 23 years), Texas (since 1994), New York (since 1994), and Florida (since 1998), and  (5) A majority of the state legislatures.  It's divided, all right. And the left resides on the side of the schism in which there is no political power whatsoever.  And, yes, they are real bitter about that.  And, frankly, the foregoing does not even begin to speak to the level to which conservatives can (and should) dominate over the left.  Take California, for example.  Liberal California, right?  Wrong.  California is a deeply-conservative state. Sure, it has two large liberal pockets, but, in that regard, it's a microcosm of the country at large. When the partisan labels of "Democrat" and "Republican" are cast aside, and voters in California are presented with  issues  on which to render opinions, as opposed to choosing between name plates, conservative viewpoints not only prevail, they prevail by overwhelming margins.  For example:   Proposition 209    This notorious ballot initiative was presented for the purpose of eradicting "affirmative action" in California's public education and public hiring and contracting systems.  For obvious reasons, liberals, the partisan-liberal media, partisan Democrats, and special interest groups, all went into high dudgeon mode. They ranted. They raved. They threatened. They howled. They demonized.  And, make no mistake about it, Prop. 209 was not some stealth proposal slipped into law in the dead of the night. It was on the November 1996 ballot. It shared space with Bill Clinton's re-election bid. And, not surprisingly, Clinton obliterated Dole in the Golden State that year, by the margin of 51-37.  Nevertheless, Prop. 209 -- again, a measure to  ban race-based preferences  -- was adopted by Golden State voters, in November 1996. And not only did the measure pass, it sailed through the electorate -- by the  landslide margin  of  urlLink 54-46 .   Proposition 187   This was a 1994 ballot measure to abolish state-funded benefits for illegal immigrants. And, as one might expect, the far left and their media minions went ballistic over it.  Despite a scorched-Earth campaign by the far left and media cabals, California voters enacted Prop. 187 into law -- by the  huge landslide margin  of  urlLink 59-41 .   Proposition 227    This 1998 ballot initiative was designed, in essence, to abolish bi-lingual education in the California public school system. Once again, the far left, the public education mafia, and the partisan media went into high dudgeon mode. Once again, a scorched-Earth campaign was mounted against a conservative referendum in the Golden State.  Yet again, however, and despite all of the hysterics from the left, the conservative viewpoint won out. Prop. 227 not only was merely approved by California's electorate. It was, in fact, adopted by the  nearly-preposterous landslide margin  of  urlLink 61-39 . Moreoever, the tidal wave in favor of English-only public education was so strong, the measure passed muster, by 12 full percentage points, with the voters of liberal, heavily-Latino  urlLink Los Angeles County .  So, what's the moral of the story?  When they are motivated, when they put aside their punctilious pet peeves, and when the partisan labels of "Democrat" and "Republican" are tossed aside, conservatism is a dominant, overwhelming political force in this country. If the foreoing ballot measures passed by such huge margins, in "liberal California," imagine the margins by which they would have been adopted in places like Florida and Texas, to say nothing of the deep South or the mid-West.  Yet, California has two of the most liberal U.S. Senators. And not only did it elect Gray Davis, it re-elected him.  Why?  Conservative self-defeatism, that's why.  For reasons that literally baffle me, conservatives have this astonishing tendency, when partisan, candidate-based contests (instead of issue-specific measures) are at the forefront, to act as though they're affilitated with the minority political movement in this country. They fret over the most picayune details of a candidate's record. They wring their hands over how a particular candidate might vote on certain proposals, even when such proposals merely are hypothetical issues inside of their own heads. They concede ground to the media and to the far left, without even putting up a fight. They bite their nails every time some liberal organization puts out a "poll" showing a liberal Democratic candidate "leading" a conservative Republican candidate. Then, they give up and tune out.  In short, conservatives have a habit of virtually  searching  for reasons  not  to vote for Republican candidates. As a result, they have a predilection towards self-disenfranchisement.  It's ridiculous!  Republicans have majority control over every facet of the state and federal governments in this country, despite the fact that literally millions of conservatives stay home every election cycle. Republicans have majority control over every facet of our state and federal governments, despite the fact that literally millions of people -- who have conservative viewpoints -- nevertheless vote for the Party label attached to "Democratic" candidates, on the basis of the label alone, and by rote. Republicans have majority control over every facet of the state and federal governments, despite the fact the Democratic Party continues to engage in systematic, widespead electoral fraud (e.g., Johnson v. Thune, Landrieu, Torricelli, etc.). Republicans have majority control over every facet of our government, despite the fact that the "mainstream media" has dropped all pretences of objectivity, and now conducts themselves as unannouced campaign spokespersons for Democrats.  If conservatives had a modicum of pragmatism as a group, and stiffer spines, as individuals, not only would conservativism have an overwhelming and irrevocable majority position in this country, as we speak, but the Democratic Party and the partisan-liberal media already would have been eliminated as even notional threats to conservative hegemony.  Looking ahead to this November, the choice could not be more clear:  There is a conservative President on the ballot. And there is a liberal Senator on the ballot.  Are you tired of the far left and their complicit media running roughshod over your causes?  Well, then, do something about it:  Stop wringing your hands. Stop watching and worrying about the "polls."  Volunteer for GOTV efforts. Be optimistic, instead of pessimistic.  And, on Nov. 2nd . . .  Vote!

      The Contest: 2002 race for the  open  Hawaii Governorship.  The Contestants: Incumbent Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Mazie Hirono, versus GOP hopeful (and failed 1998 Gubernatorial candidate) Linda Lingle.   The Poll   Date: October 27, 2002 Source:  urlLink ABC Affiliate KITV/Honolulu Star-Bulletin  "Poll;" "The race for governor is a straight-on tie," said the article.  The breadown of the "poll," to which that article pertained, was  40-40 .  Eighteen percent were said to be "undecided," and, as such, 2 percent were leaning towards minor-party candidates.   The Actual Result   Date: November 5, 2002 Source:  urlLink Voters  Result:  Lingle wins ,  52-47 , with 1 percent going to a third-party candidate.  Hmm.  Yet another post-2000 race in which, for the pre-election "poll" to have been accurate, the overwhelming majority of the "undecided voters," in this instance, anywhere from 61 to 67 percent, would have needed to cast their ballots for the GOP candidate.  Did something happen to the Democratic Party in 2000 that might have caused a bit of cognitive dissonance, desperation, and general feelings of mortification?  Oh, right . . .

      Earlier this year, it was reported that the citizens of Michigan favored a ban on affirmative action, by a margin of 64-23, with the remainder undecided.  The Detroit Free Press, God bless 'em, thought that that margin, in favor of the conservative viewpoint, represented a " urlLink slim majority ."  Well, two more slim majorities were reported today.  1)  Over the past year, the number of states in which unemployment has  decreased  is . . . . 49.  Out of 50, of course.  2)  Over the past year, the number of states in which payroll  job creation  has  increased  is . . . . 46.  (See  urlLink here .)  Hmm.  49-1, huh?  46-4, eh?  I suspect the liberal media would consider those margins to be further evidence of a "bitterly divided electorate."  Don't you?

      Negative.  I believe the markets are way too expensive (overvalued) and, as such, have no interest in buying stocks right now; at least not as a general proposition.  Regarding individual issues, however, I still like Washington Mutual [WM], in which I own numerous shares.  High yield (dividend payout relative to stock price). Cheap (low stock price relative to prior and expected earnings). Out of favor with Mr. Market (the drones who buzz around Wall St. hate it; conventional wisdom indicates that it's a bad pick).  So, in other words:  It's perfect!

      Minnesota was the only state in the country that voted for Walter Mondale, back in 1984. The state voted for Michael Dukakis, in 1988. In 2000, it voted for Al Gore.  It is precisely for those reasons that Minnesota provides a firm indicator of what really is happening, behind the scenes, and off the media radar screen, to the fortunes of the Democratic Party.  First thing first: Minnesota is an "old school" Democratic state. In fact, the Democratic Party is not even called the Democratic Party there. It's the "DFL," which stands for "Democrat-Farm-Labor."  Why is this relevant?  Check the numbers.  In 1988, Michael Dukakis received 53 percent of the state's votes.  In 2000, on the other hand, Al Gore only received 48 percent. And that's despite Gore being the  incumbent ; whereas, the Duke was running  against  the incumbent.  Then, in 2002, Minnesota elected a  urlLink Republican Senator  and a  urlLink Republican Governor . And that's despite (1) the fact that the Gubernatorial election was an open race, and (2) that the DFL candidate for Senator was Minnesota political icon, and former elected Vice President, Walter Mondale.  Why the trend away from the Democrats?  Simple: the passing away of the FDR bloc.  In Minnesota, like any other state, there was a huge percentage of the electorate that automatically voted for the "Democrat" over the "Republican," regardless of the issues, or the candidates' respective positions thereon. That is why the Democratic Party had power. It was not because of the lock-step votes of African-Americans. And, for obvious reasons, it certainly was not because of their principles, their values, or their positions on the issues.  It's not as if Americans ever wanted to be taxed more, or to have softer criminal penalities, or to give away the Panama Canal, or to have oppressive regulations on businesses. Not at all. But, as suggested above, there were millions upon millions of Americans who simply never voted for Republican candidates; even though, ironically enough, they slanted to the right, both socially and economically. These are people who would throw a hissy fit if someone actually tried to raise their local taxes, but, then, in the next breath, they would send uber-liberals, like Paul Wellstone, to Washington, D.C.  Those days are ending.  The FDR bloc consists, obviously, of people who are extremely old. And, not to be morbid about it, and, of course, no disrespect intended, but they are dying off. They are not going to be replaced.  The Democratic Party loses net votes every single day of every single week. And now they have the added burden of having to overcome incumbency on the part of the GOP. And, let's be blunt: it's not as if they can do that by actually standing up for what they believe. People are not going to suddenly want to go back to Carter-ism.  The Democratic Party is in steep decline. They will not exist -- as an organized political party -- in 15 years. And, frankly, the final chapter of their story could very well come much, much sooner than that.

       The Contest:   2002 race for Governor of Minnestota (10 electoral votes)   The Candidates:   Tim Pawlenty, Republican Roger Moe, Democrat Tim Penny, Independent   The "Polls"   Date: October 12, 2002 Source:  urlLink John Zogby and MSNBC   Pawlenty (R) - 30 percent Moe (D) - 25 percent Penny (I) - 27 percent Undecided - 16 percent  Date: November 3, 2002 Source:  urlLink The Minneapolis Pioneer Press/Mason-Dixon   Pawlenty (R) - 36 percent Moe (D) - 32 percent Penny (I) - 16 percent Undecided - 14 percent  Date: November 3, 2002 Source:  urlLink The Minneapolis Star Tribune   Pawlenty (R) - 35 percent Moe (D) - 32 percent Penny (I) - 16 percent Undecided - 14 percent   The Actual Results   Date: November 5, 2002 Source:  urlLink Voters   Pawlenty (R) - 44 percent Moe (D) - 37 percent Penny (I) - 16 percent Other - 3 percent Undecided - zero (0) percent  Hmm.  If those "polls" were accurate, that would mean the Republican, Pawlenty, received in excess of 57 percent of the so-called "undecided" votes; whereas, the Democrat, Moe, received less than 40 percent of such votes.  How in the name of Al Gore, Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale, and George McGovern, could  that  have happened?

      I've always had a special place in my heart for the Reuters "news" service. You see, Reuters is not like our domestic wire services or other "news" agencies.  Our domestic media always has been liberal and it always has been biased. However, they managed to keep things somewhat sane; at least until the Supreme Court stopped the Florida recount, back in 2000. Reuters, on the other hand, never was bound by those rules. They've always been so blatently liberal and so brazenly biased as to be absurd.  Now, they've just gone ahead and left the gravitational pull of the Sun.  Today's campaign headline:  " urlLink Kerry to Attack Bush Troop Withdrawal Plan "  The first graf?  Democrat John Kerry on Wednesday  planned to attack  Present (sic) George W. Bush's plan to withdraw . . . American troops . . . as a threat to national security that could blunt the war on terror,  campaign aides said . (Emphasis added.)  Yep.  It's not enough for them to just wait until Kerry actually says or does something, and then to "report" on those events in a biased and slanted fashion. Now, they actually are slanting their coverage in favor of Kerry and against Bush . . .  before  the events to which their coverage relate even occur!  Beam me up, Scotty!

      When Bill Clinton stood for re-election, the media incessantly pounded the drum beat of the "greatest economy ever."  On the other hand, now that George Bush -- a Republican (gasp!) -- is standing for re-election, the media sees only gloom and doom and "economic angst."  Here's an interesting factoid for them:  January 1, 1993 - June 30, 2004 (Clinton's first term)  Total increase in after-tax personal income for all Americans = 17.05 percent  January 1, 2001 - June 30, 2004 (Bush's first term)  Total increase in after-tax personal income for all Americans = 16.57 percent  Not much of a difference, huh?  Too bad the media is missing out on all of this. Minds are terrible things to waste.

      The "mainstream media" currently is in a death spiral. Their influence is fading. Their credibility is shattered. Their readership and viewership are falling like stones. In fact, regarding the latter point, the decline of the "mainstream media" almost is staggering.  On a population-adjusted basis, the electronic political media has lost the overwhelming majority of its audience over the past 45 years. In 1960, 44 percent of the country's total populace watched one of the debates between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. On the other hand, in 2000, merely 13 percent of the population watched the debates between Al Gore and George Bush. Literally 70 percent of their viewership had tuned out in the interim.  Print media is faring no better. Since 1970 -- again, on a population-adjusted basis -- newspapers have lost roughly 50 percent of their readers. Think about that: half their subscribers have gone away, in only 35 years!  (Note: this data can be accessed by going  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , then  urlLink here  (electronic); and then  urlLink here  (print).)  Now, here comes the fun part: watching the media cover their own grisly demise.  As one might expect, the "mainstream media" is not assessing their own terminal situation with clear-eyed, reality-based logic.  Nope. It's more along the lines of reality denial.  The last major report on newspaper circulation showed a 0.3 percent, year-over-year  decline  in daily circulation, and a 0.4 percent, year-over-year  decline  in Sunday circulation. And, of course, those figures are not adjusted for population. So, in other words, following up their previous, shocking losses, they recently lost additional net readers; even without taking into consideration the larger decline, in percentage terms, of their influence on the public at large.  So, how did the Associated Press "report" these facts?  " urlLink Newspaper circulation stays level "  Yep.  About as "level" as the Titanic, after it hit the iceberg.  And, to take this from the absurd to the sublime, the Associated Press, in the course of trying to convince itself that everything is A-OK, managed to mine this gem of a quote from some brain dead financial analyst:   It's not terribly different from the long-term trend,  which is one of a slight decline every year for the last 20 years.  (Emphasis added.)  Riiiight.  That's true. They lose net readers every single year. And the population increases every single year. So, what's the problem, Virginia? All is well.  And this entire analysis of print media circulation does not even take into account the fact that much of their "circulation"  urlLink is the product of blatant fraud .  You know, guys and gals, this all reminds me of that scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail," in which Graham Chapman's character severs the arm of the Black Knight, during a sword fight.  The Black Knight's response?  "It's just a flesh wound."

      Back in the Fall of 2002 --  before  the elections, of course -- the Democratic Party and the partisan-liberal/Democratic media were certain that the Democrats would re-take the U.S. Senate, and gain seats in, if not outright control of, the U.S. House.  One of the key races, in their minds, was for the Colorado Senate seat, in which incumbent GOP Senator Wayne Allard was facing Democrat Tom Strickland. The media and the Democratic Party believed that Allard was toast.  Of course, that was the Kool-Aid talking. And nowhere were partisan Democrats and liberals chug-a-glug, glugging more Kool-Aid than in the inner sactums of the partisan-liberal "polling" services:   The Polls   Date: October 12, 2002 Source:  urlLink John Zogby and MSNBC  "Poll:" Strickland leads Allard, 41-40  Date: November 2, 2002 Source:  urlLink Gallup/CNN/USA Today  "Poll:" A statistical tie; Allard leads Strickland, 47-45, with 8 percent "undecided"  Date: November 3, 2002 Source:  urlLink NBC affiliate KUSA TV Denver/The Denver Post/Ciruli Associates  "Poll:" Strickland leads Allard by one point, 42-41; race is "too close to call"   The Actual Results     Date: November 5, 2002 Source:  urlLink Voters  Results:  Allard wins, 51-46   Hmm.  If that last "poll," by the NBC station and the Denver Post, actually was correct, that would mean the incumbent, Allard, received 59 percent support from the so-called "undecided" voters; whereas, the challenger, Strickland, received less than one quarter of those votes.  Gee, I thought that "undecideds break for the challenger."  Well, I guess that meme only holds true when it's a  Democratic incumbent  who is ousted from office.  No?

      The Associated Press came out with a piece about the aftermath of Hurricane Charley earlier today. And MSNBC has it as one of their  urlLink top stories .  So, I check out the article, and, not surprisingly, it's laden with tales of human experiences. And it's written in the somber tones one would expect.  But something else jumped out at me:  President Bush is not mentioned anywhere in the article.  There's no mention of his very recent visit to the disaster area. There's no quote from him regarding aid to the families or federal money for the clean up. His name literally does not appear in the text. There's not even a mention of his brother, which seems odd, given that he's the Governor of the state.  On the other hand:  1) Back in mid-July 1996 -- during Clinton's re-election season -- there was an airline disaster involving the crash of TWA Flight 800. Especially at the beginning stages of the investigation, it was strongly suspected that terrorists might have been responsible.  The large-circulation New York newspaper,  urlLink Newsday , ran a piece on the tragedy and the ensuing investigation, on July 26, 1996. In stark contrast to this morning's piece from MSNBC and the Associated Press, Bill Clinton was prominently featured. They even managed to fit in a quote about Clinton, from a person who lost a family member in the plane crash. That person was reported to have said that Clinton: "was very reasurring as a human being."  Touching, huh?  2) We had hurricanes back in 1996 too. One of the them, Fran, did considerable damage in the Carolinas and elsewhere along the Eastern Seaboard.  On September 9, 1996,  urlLink CNN ran a piece on Fran's wrath , while she was still intact as a storm, no less. Not surprisingly, President Clinton was prominently featured. His name showed up in the third graf. CNN told its readers that Clinton "pledged continued assistance to flood victims by the Federal Emergency Management Agency." CNN also quoted Clinton declaring that FEMA would continue to assess the situation "until we are assured that all of the needs of the affected populations are met."  Very Presidential, huh?  I wonder why [27 electoral votes] this particular dichotomy exists [27 electoral votes] in their coverage [27 electoral votes] of Hurricane Charley [27 electoral votes] versus natural and man-made disasters [27 electoral votes] from back in July 1996?

      1) Total inflation actually  urlLink fell  last month,  2) Yet another major company --  urlLink Home Depot  -- is seeing continued growth in the economy,  3) The housing sector was  urlLink much stronger in July  than it was in June.  There's always the stem cell debate, I guess.

      In today's business section, USA Today devoted a large-point, block-print headline to the following story:  " urlLink Miramax to cut 65 jobs "  Whoa!  65 jobs, huh?  Well, you know, the number of persons employed in the U.S. is about  urlLink 140 million .   So, the Hoover-ish news from Miramax -- a small movie studio -- represents just about the following percentage of the working labor force in this country:  0.0000004 percent.  Yep.  They're really starting to scrape from the bottom of the barrel, aren't they?

      So, ever since the economy paused in June, the media has been screaming the chorus of "economic angst" at the voters. Frankly, they're not bothering even to be the least bit subtle about their electorally-driven, economic fear mongering.  Well, on the other hand:  1) The country's second largest home improvement chain --  urlLink Lowe's  -- sees things a bit differently.  2) And the world's largest company by revenue --  urlLink Wal-Mart  -- sees August sales growing at a solid clip.  Hmm.  Two of the country's leading corporations versus the media.  I'll bet against the media.

      So, Mike Wise of the left-wing Washington Post comes out with an article today about some of the U.S. losses, to date, at the Olympic games; and, specifically, about several lame excuses offered up for those defeats.  Of course, there could have been 50 different headlines for that piece.  What did the WaPo (and MSNBC) choose?  " urlLink Americans prove to be world-class whiners ."  Ah, yeah. Precious, huh?  You know, back in 1984, such an article would have had a headline like: "U.S. Swim and Basketball Teams Give Excuses for Unexpected Olympic Failures." Or something along those lines. You see, the liberal bias and anti-Americanism of the media was much more subtle in those days.  Now?  Fah-get-a-bout-it!!! They're not holding back anymore.

      USA Men's Basketball  urlLink hit a new low  in their shocking loss to Puerto Rico on Sunday.  But, frankly, the loss shouldn't have been all that shocking. Especially within the confines of international rules, our men's B-Ball program has been in steep decline for a decade already.  You know, I see a parallel between the comparative fortunes of our men's basketball team and the modern version of the Democratic Party.  In August 1992, the USA's Dream Team (Jordan, Magic, Bird, Stockton &amp; Malone) swept to the gold medal in a series of absurd blow outs. Now? It's not inconceivable that they'll finish  fourth  or even  fifth,  in this year's Olympics.  In January 1993, the Democratic Party had absolute power in this country. Now? They have no power whatsoever. And their fortunes decline, steadily, year after year.  In-ter-es-ting . . .

      If Daschle is turned out of office, one of the following three scenarios would occur:  1) Business as usual.  The Dems just hunker down and continue filibustering judges, blocking needed reforms, and generally acting like spoiled children who didn't get the presents they wanted.  2) A sea change in philosophy and tactics.  Moderates take over the Dem caucus and they begin working with the GOP from the standpoint of trying to improve the country's problems, as opposed to treating the Upper Chamber the way an organized crime syndicate might view hostage taking.  3) A complete meltdown.  Open, outright internecine warfare erupts between the lunatic left fringe (e.g., Levin, Kennedy, Leahy, etc.) and the moderates and conservatives in their stead. Their united front is shattered. One or two vulnerable Dems in conservative states (e.g., Landrieu) flips to the GOP. Additionally, one or two moderate Dems (e.g., Dorgan) flips to the GOP.  Have I missed any other potential scenarios?  And, which of them is the most likely actually to occur?

      The cryonism, sharp tactics, and political gamesmanship  urlLink described in this article  could be pinned on literally scores of Democratic Party politicians over the decades, especially in big cities.  It's an archetypal example of how the Democratic Party operates: money, political muscle, unethical behavior, and ruthlessness abound.  P.S. - You don't need to Google Kevin Shelley or Willie Brown -- the two major politicians to which references are made in the article -- to know that they're both Democrats.  In and of itself, the very fact that their party identification is  not  made automatically establishes, ipso facto, that they  must  be Democrats.  Had they been Republicans, on the other hand, that not only would have been stated, it would have been  highlighted .
