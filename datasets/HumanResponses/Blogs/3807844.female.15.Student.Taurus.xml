      I really wish that people were not so dramatic , Am I really nieve well honestly I don't think I am. One person told me I was nieve when it came 2 boys, because I don't know when they check me out or hit on me . I think if u think that people are checking u out or hitting on u that u are kinda vain and stuck on yourself. I really don't care if any guy looks at me as long as I marry Devan. Andrew got the same car as Devan that is not cool. All I could think of last night was Devan it was weird I havnt felt like that in a while , oh well. I really dont want 2 start school cause I know it is going 2 be a walking Hell cause their is no one that I can really trust there. And I could say some other things but I will write those in my real journal. maybe

      Fumbling his confidence &nbsp;And wondering why the world has passed him by &nbsp;Hoping that he's bid for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly [Chorus] We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside &nbsp;Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries  Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open  Maybe we're bent and broken, broken  [Chorus] We want more than this world's got to offer  We want more than this world's got to offer  We want more than the wars of our fathers  And everything inside screams for second life, yeah We were meant to live for so much more &nbsp;Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live for so much more &nbsp;Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live We were meant to live
