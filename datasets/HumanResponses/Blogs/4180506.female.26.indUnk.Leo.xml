       As you both (or.. anyone else that may be randomly reading my blog, hi there random stranger :D) .. anyways .. as you both know i am going out of town .. booo yaaaa biatch ... for the next 3 weeks so I am going to try to blog as often as i can in case i'm not able to whilst i am away. so let's all look forward to some pointless blogs with little or no regard to entertainment value. Good Times.  On a freaky note; there is a painting that has been following me around since yesterday. I see this painting everywhere I go. I think I am afraid, for real.. it could be deja vu .. but I don't think so.. I've seen this same painting in the office, in the tanning salon, on the TV at the gym .. it keeps popping up .. and it's not even like a famous painting, it's a palm tree. I just want it to go away, but since I am facing it from where I am sitting now.. it will stare me down for the next 6 hours.  *shudder* i hope it shant haunt you all as well.

        ok so i haven't really blogged in a while, i've been slacking i know, and half assing it by just commenting on other blogs, so here is a feeble attempt at a mid-morning blog.

       the hurricane is coming .. and we are doomed.  Especially Aliss and I if we end up having to endure a night and a day with mom and abuela .. I'd prefer to stand outside in the middle of the hurricane.  Anyways, so this could very well be my last post, if I die .. so I'd like to say that I would definitely be disappointed that I would miss out on my trips to vegas and back to nyc, but hey those are the brakes baby.

        ok so i hate people    I have come to the conclusion that most people are just not worth my time, so why bother. Why you may ask? Well, there are a million reasons, here are just a few     I hate people that: Take too long at the ATM/bank/grocery store checkout/ etc.. Try to rush into the train without letting u out first Have staring problems while you're trying to eat in a public establishment, or trying to do anything in public Talk shit Invade my personal space Pick noses Hock loogies in my walking space (yes this has happened to me) Have no consideration for your homosexuality Have too much consideration for your homosexuality and can't take a hint Think just because they think I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread and zippers I should feel the same way about them and get extremely pissed when I don't Say they'll call and don't Play games Wear shorts in NYC Talk really loud on their cells while on the train or anywhere else where I can hear EVERY word and I assure you I could care less about their drama Use the car horn as a means of communication Can't differentiate between your and you're Walk too slow down busy streets Leave the door open while peeing in public.. all together now.. EW Tourists in NYC Ask obvious questions... ie; so you're gay, does that mean you don't date guys? Ask me if i'm a natural blonde (see above) Take off their shoes in public Take my arm space on planes, trains.. etc (see invading personal space) The 10 people upstairs who must weigh at least 400 pounds each cause they are STOMPING ON MY ROOF RIGHT NOW! (girls who) Ask me for 3 somes after the 1st date (guys who) Ask me for 3 somes Spit while talking, eating, doing anything that involves your mouth, because these people have no spit control, you know what i'm talking about Strangers who try (unsuccessfully) to make me laugh and then do that *nudge* and laugh some more (see personal space) Grab onto me on the train when it comes to a sudden stop to stop THEMSELVES from falling Think i'm snotty and pretentous just because I know what I want and what I don't   Ok so yeah I think I am a little bitter today .... I'm sure there is more to come...

        ok so today didn't start out with the greatest of potentials since I did have to wake up at 6:30am to go to work .. or better said .. to sit on my ass all day long and work with computers, which is basically what i do at home, but instead I have to wake up early to do it and get paid for it, maybe it balances out, maybe not.
