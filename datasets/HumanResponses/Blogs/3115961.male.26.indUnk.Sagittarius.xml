      Well, the European Commission is going to be voting Monday, September 1st on Software Patents there.  Hopefully it does not pass because it could mean trouble for almost all independant software developers and users too.  For much more detailed information see the following link.   urlLink

      The all new Napster 2.0 came out yesterday.  Since I'm always looking at new stuff and whatnot I checked it out.  I toyed with it for about 7 minutes and then uninstalled it.  It has no support at all for my iPod so it's not any use to me at all.  Maybe ya'll would like it.   urlLink

      This is commercial software but it's never lost a 100% In the Wild Virus test for the last several years.  It's $39 for the first year and it doesn't slow down my system at ALL.  They do offer a 30 day trial.

      Started playing online in Battlefield with a clan that goes by the name of ARSClan.  A great group of people so far.  I've known one of their members for a while now from my other website and EverQuest so it's not like I just jumped in with no background info.  P.S.  Battlefield: Vietnam seems to be really good.  It sure is fun!    Check out Ars at  urlLink Arsclan.net

      Using the Mac OS X the last couple days has made me realize how far behind the various Linux distributions are in terms of usability and compatibility. They’re both based off of the UNIX system and I’ve tinkered with Linux for years but the Mac has this really great interface on top of it, plus applications that are easy to install with lots of programs available. Linux has extremely poor hardware compatiblity, poor app availability and a decent looking interface but nowhere near anything else. Also, everything is harder to configure in Linux vs Windows & Mac.  However, I could easily see the future of Linux being very similar to the Mac OS. The distros and companies involved just really need to get their act together and make it happen. Pronto!

      Typing this here blog entry on it in fact. It’s a really nice looking machine and I’ve got my iTunes stuff imported…though it didn’t save my ratings, play counts etc. I may have to look at redoing that so it will hold onto that stuff. I’ve got thousands of tunes that I don’t really feel like rating again, ugh.  I’ve already put a different mouse on it. I can’t stand the single button thing and was going to go nuts dealing with it. So I threw a nice MS Intellipoint on it and everything is SO much better now. I’ve got some issues with the keyboard but I’ll get used to it or replace that too  More to come later!

      …A NEW CAR!  I just signed a lease on a brand new  urlLink Toyota Camry XLE  and it rocks! It was night time before I was finished signing paperwork but I’ll get some photos posted soon. This car is awesome, it’s got about every option known to man and I feel like I’m living high on the hog to drive such a nice car around. Yay!

      …a Mac.  Yes, you heard me right. I have ordered an  urlLink Apple  computer. I’ve looked at them for a while now but never could make myself or justify the price. I finally realized I had the wrong attitude. I’m a geek so if nothing else it’s another OS and platform to conquer! I’ve done the DOS thing, the Windows thing, the Novell thing, the Windows NT thing, and the Linux thing. Now it’s time to do the Mac thing. I’m actually really looking forward to it now. It’s supposed to ship within the next two days. I also realized I couldn’t ever make myself order the new iMac or PowerMac because of cost so I went with an eMac with a SuperDrive. The idea is to replace my secondary “non gaming” PC with this. I can’t wait to hear what my Father has to say about this…fortunatly he probably won’t find out until I tell him…heh heh heh.  Updates when I actually get the thing. This could prove interesting as I’ve never touched a Mac in my life. I’m supposed to hate the things

      I’m at work testing out our Exchange server. I guess we’re not quite going to upgrade it tonight. Instead I’ll build up a new, 2nd Exchange server so we don’t have to worry about “breaking” this one. Sounds good to me.  Ah, only 2-3 hours left to go till I can go home. Joy!

      Went and saw  urlLink The Alamo  Saturday like I mentioned. It was ok but certainly not the greatest tale ever told. I’m not up to date on the true Alamo history and I liked the characters but it felt like it could have been a lot more than it was. *shrug*  Since early this morning or late last night all my sites have been down due to a mySQL error with my host. Once I saw the problem and put in a help ticket their support people fixed it very quickly. Great job to  urlLink them .  Wow, it’s Monday already. Yesterday was my sisters birthday (she turned 14) so we had all the regular birthday stuff to do and that was fun. She wanted to play Monopoly and I was reluctant to play but ended up trouncing the competition so it was all good in the end. This week is going to be hectic at best at work. Wednesday night will be an all nighter…working from 9pm to 3am that night, plus regular work hours Tuesday and Wednesday so that won’t be very much fun.  Still haven’t decided on a new case for my iPod. Just can’t find that special case yet. Also, my Sis wants to go to a movie tonight for another birthday gift. So I’m sure that will either be Walking Tall or Hellboy….probably Hellboy.

      I rented a few movies last night and a friend called me up this morning wanting to see The Alamo, so we’ll go see that this afternoon. WatchedMatchstick Men and School of Rock last night. I liked  urlLink Matchstick Men , but I didn’t much care for  urlLink School of Rock  at all. I’ll let you know what I think of them once I get a write up done and a link set up.

      Gah, the case that came with my  urlLink iPod  is starting to scratch my screen. This is not good, so I have stopped using it. However, now it’s completely unprotected and I need a new case. I’d like to find something that protects the screen and that I can operate the buttons easily without having to take it in/out all the time. Maybe some sort of skin…  Anyway, I’ll look around and see what I can find but anybody has a suggestion please email me.

      I’m going to be compiling a list of tools I can recommend to people for their PCs, some freeware and some commercial software. Sometimes both categories will have the “same” software, Anti-Virus for example. The Paid version or paid software would be considered better, but free would be OK. Definately better than nothing. Anyway, I’ll be working on this list this weekend and will post more details when it’s ready for viewing.

      It’s finally Friday! I’m no longer on-call as of today for another week and will be able to finally relax a bit, go watch a movie at the theatre. The problem is that they have THREE movies I am wanting to see right now.  urlLink The Alamo   urlLink Hellboy , and  urlLink Walking Tall . What to do, what to do!?  Also, I have the opportunity to go to Phoenix on Sunday for a  urlLink Diamondbacks  game. Too many decisions  OK, I have to finish fixing some problems and hopefully I can get out of here a bit early today.

      I’ve now switched away from blogger.com to do my dirty work for me because after thinking about it I didn’t want to rely on somebody elses site for my site to be updated which to me makes a lot of sense. They have a nice setup but since I have a fully self contained site I might as well keep it that way.  So I installed a nice blogger system called WordPress which is pretty easy to setup and use so it gets a big thumbs up in my book :) Link at the bottom right for those interested in it.

      My boss is out of town to Las Vegas on a "business" trip.  He won't be back until  maybe  late Friday but I won't see him until Monday.  Been pretty busy at work though.  Installed two brand new machines today and another new one yesterday.  Have three new PCs sitting in my office ready to be installed sometime later this week.  This is besides all the calls I got today...yeah, stayed pretty busy today.  Glad to be home though I'm on-call for work in case something happens but I'm pretty used to it now.    Yes, in case you're wondering I still absolutely LOVE my  urlLink iPod  from Apple.  See, even a hardcore PC person owns a genuine Apple product!  This thing has 40GB of storage of which I'm only using around 8 for nearly my full music Collection.  The iPod, iTunes and the iTunes Music Store is just a love triangle made in heaven.  I haven't bought a retail CD in months now due to the great music store Apple has set up and then it just syncs with my iPod.  Love it.  Though I need a new case for my iPod, the one that came with it really is nasty and it's starting to scratch my screen.  Time to research something better.  Speaking of computers, I still need to upgrade my little sisters PC with this 1.8GHz I have sitting here.  *sigh*, maybe this weekend.

      I absolutely love(d) the first Splinter Cell so when I found out they were coming out with a sequel I couldn't wait.  Then they said it was going to have multiplayer I was super excited to be sure.  Well, I have the game.  I still love the single player but I get my butt kicked  HARD  online.  I gotta find a core group of players to get better with.  There are a couple over at Arsclan with it, I'll have to send them a message about playing sometime.

      This week has been a total nightmare at work. Constant issues. Fighting Active Directory on some of our new Windows Server 2003 boxes, a hardware failure in one of our servers to electrical problems last night causing headaches. Neverending Battles sometimes.  I’m glad it’s Friday although I’m starting my week of call today, I’m just hoping everything dies down so I can get some peace and quiet.  At home I’ve been playing some City of Heroes but haven’t yet gotten very far into it. After about 4 or 5 levels I get unhappy with my Character and try out another combination. One of the bad things about this game really is that there are too many options :)  Today is my father’s Birthday so…Happy Birthday!  Ok, it’s almost lunch time and I’m definatly ready for a break. See ya later.

      OK, I got my copy of City of Heroes last night and just from the couple hours I had time to play last night it seems really neato so far. I’ve probably spent almost as much time in Character Creation that I did actually playing the game. I have to think of a really cool Super Hero now :)  I’ll have more details and a proper look at it sometime later.

      OK, I mentioned I was going to PAX up in Seattle.  It's finally settled and written in stone.  Basically I'll be going solo though.  I asked one of my cousins to go with me for some Seattle sightseeing but he's trying to get a job right now so he had to decline.  I wish him luck and I understand.  I'll just go by myself! :)  Short version is I'll be flying to Seattle August 27th, getting a rental car and staying at the Coast Bellevue Hotel in Bellevue, WA which is about 5 blocks from the convention center I need to attend PAX at.  The Expo is August 28th and 29th, then I will have the next two full days to do sightseeing and fly back to Phoenix on September 1st.  I'm really looking forward to it now, I've never been north of Utah and will be a new adventure for me.  Here are a couple links to what I'm attending:  PAX is pretty much a gaming expo, PC, consoles, tabletop etc.  urlLink Penny Arcade Expo   urlLink Penny Arcade comic

      Actually, I got back home Sunday afternoon but haven't updated the ol' blog till today.  The Phoenix trip was good, got to see one of my cousins get married and was able to get some "city" shopping done while we were down there.  Apple got a couple hundred more of my hard earned dollars though, went over to the Apple store and picked up their  urlLink Airport Extreme  which works extremely well.  I had a D-Link 802.11g access point before which needed constant attention, especially from the wireless clients I have here.  With the Airport everything just...works!  Even the Windows XP wireless clients connect flawlessly.  A little bit pricey @ $200 for the Access point but I think it's worth it so far.  Besides, this sets me up so I'm ready for the  urlLink Airport Express  which comes out in July.   I was extremely tempted to go ahead and pick up an Apple iBook but I just couldn't justify it at all so I am without.  Besides, I have another trip in August to worry about.  More on that in a minute....   We stayed at a La Quinta in Mesa which I can HIGHLY recommend to anybody.  It was a very very nice room and the service that we needed was awesome.   Speaking of computer stuff, even at the wedding reception my skills with computers were called on again.  They were trying to display a slideshow/video type thing on a laptop onto a regular TV, which they have done before...but before upgrading to Windows XP.  I ended up having to take the laptop to their house to get online to install the correct driver but after that everything worked great.   All in all a really good trip.  My Camry drove awesomely again as expected and it's just been back to work starting Monday.  All righty, a write up of what my August trip will be in just a few minutes.

      Well, looks like I'm getting ready to head down to the Valley of the Sun.  I'm told it's hot down there right now but when you have family stuff like a wedding to attend it doesn't particularly matter what the temperature is outside.  It will be fun though, get to do some shopping while there and being in a rural area it's a great change of pace once in a while.

      Well, I got myself a gMail account from Google.  Though some imposter already had the address that's rightfully mine so I had to pick an alternate.  I really like the interface and am seriously thinking about using it as a primary address and just forwarding super important emails from it to an "archive" of some sort on my own email server.  It's still in beta and I was just lucky enough to get ahold of an account.  yay me!

      Wow, a great week for the Mozilla group. All three of their main products have new versions out this week, the latest today is  urlLink Mozilla 1.7 . Earlier this week  urlLink FireFox 0.9  and  urlLink Thunderbird 0.7  were released.  For those not in the know, Mozilla is the full suite of apps, Browser, Chat, Mail, and HTML editor. FireFox is simply a browser and Thunderbird is an email client.  I can highly recommend ALL of them wholeheartily to anybody online. They work on basically all platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux. Great stuff.

       urlLink GameSpy  is having a huge  urlLink EverQuest II  section with tours, videos, new screenshots and articles. Definatly something to check out  urlLink here . Everything I read about it makes me just want it even more than before. September can’t come soon enough :)

       urlLink FilePlanet , my favorite online location to get files, demos etc has been having an  urlLink Asheron’s Call 2 Promotion  that allows you do download the full client (about 900MBs) and play for a month for only $12.95. Since I haven’t been playing any MMOs lately other than little bits of City of Heroes I did some reading about it and just depending on what you read or who you ask depends on if it’s any good or not. So I figured I’d give it a shot.  Got my Lugian (sp?) Magic user up to level 8 before logging out and I haven’t grouped yet but first impressions are OK. It’s two years old now but the graphics are still pretty good, character animations are a little odd but still nice looking. Server populations are low but I imagine after a bit more solo leveling I can start finding some groups.  Gonna see if my sis wants to give it a show with me, stuff is always more fun in groups right? (Well, sometimes….)

      I have an active  urlLink City of Heroes  account but my little sister uses it, I don’t have the same zeal for online games anymore like she does. I honestly hope that all changes with the release of  urlLink World of Warcraft  and/or  urlLink EverQuest II . They both look seriously promising and from all accounts I’ve heard and read could be serious fun again.  I don’t even get on much for BF: Vietnam or UT2004 and I really should. I need to get a nice USB headset because right now I have nothing, so I can listen to the Arsclanners but nothing else :)  Mostly I find myself playing single player games now days though, there are so many good ones out and coming up soon. Thief 3, FarCry, Full Spectrum Warrior. Actually, for the last couple weeks I’ve been plodding through the expansions for Neverwinter Nights, it became fun again for me for some reason, LOL.  Finished Shadows of the Undrentide and am currectly in chapter 2 of Hordes of the Underdark and I’m having a blast. Go figure.  All righty then. Yak at you all again later.

      Pretty good flick. I’m sure it will get purchased when it comes out on DVD. It was worth seeing for sure.  Actually, what gets me going is when people are talking about the Harry Potter books and they go on and on about what an amazing imagination Rowling has to create all these things, like she’s the first one to do something like this.  urlLink Tolkien  thought up entire worlds and languages for his books, and finally people are recognizing him more again with the popularity of the Lord of the Rings movies. My personal favorite author,  urlLink Terry Brooks  started writing Fantasy back in the 70s with the  urlLink Sword of Shannara  and 12 novels later is still writing Shannara books, which are all excellent in my opinion.  Anyway, I guess it’s good for the Fantasy genre that Harry Potter is so popular but still, it irks me when better Fantasy authors are thrown by the wayside because they weren’t necessarily aimed at kids or hugely popular.

      Well, it’s done. Today at 5pm I’ll be seeing the new  urlLink Harry Potter  movie. Looking forward to it though actually. I didn’t read the books but I liked the first and second movies.

      I went and saw it yesterday. Pretty spectacular visuals and not even a half bad story. It has made my “To Buy” list when it comes out on DVD. Pretty impressive destruction stuff :)

      Yay, it’s finally Friday and I’m almost out of here. I think I may go see  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  but my family is going to want to see  urlLink The new Harry Potter  and truth be told I want to see it also.  Maybe both? :)  Nobody in town has  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior  yet and it’s a bit frustrating. However, the reviews are still positive so I will still be getting it. Hopefully before it’s in the bargain bin :)  Yak at ya later.

      I’m looking forward to getting my hands on a copy of  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior  on the XBOX. It’s already getting good reviews and I’m really wanting it. Went over to Wal-Mart and they didn’t have it yet, the bums. Unfortunatly it’s the only place in town for games. If I’m really lucky it will be at the rental place so I’ll stop there today after work and find out. Check out the reviews at the link above for more info. It’s NOT an FPS but more of a strategy game, but not really…it’s different. Sounds good though!

      OK, my awesome vacation is over and I’m back at work. Had a good visit from my Dad and he’s finally got his prosthetic(sp?) leg but it’s going to take some work before he walks around on it well. I’m sure he can’t wait though, it will be a great day for everybody.  The only real “bad” thing about their visit was the way we were all eating! Oink oink! I haven’t eaten like that for months and it was nice but I’m NOT going to keep doing that. Today is the day they fly back home and I’m back at work. Everything is already kind of back to normal here for me, I’ve already got a dozen things piled up needing attention.
