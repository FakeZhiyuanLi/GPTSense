      Brynath stood firm, his sword raised high, his feet planted wide, ready to meet the babhu's assault. His face was set in a grim smile and no fear showed in the dark eyes, narrowed against the setting sun. The babhu opened its frothing jaws and roared again. Then, lowering its massive head, it charged.   Brynath leaped to the left to avoid the slavering mouth, bringing his sword down in a mighty blow that cut deep into the beasts muscled shoulder. The bahbu howled in pain and anger and reeled, claws flashing in the reddening light, tearing open a long gash in Brynath's thigh. The blood of beast and man mingled on the ground.  Brynath struggled to keep his footing on grass slippery with gore, but with the balance of the warrior, he spun on his toes to plunge his sword down behind the bahbu's head, severing it's spine.   It's scream of anger cut off, the beast fell thrashing to the ground. It's limbs twitched feebly as the blood soaked into it's matted fur and it's life ebbed away into the dirt. Brynath put one foot on the creature's back and, with a grunt, pulled his dripping sword free. Wiping his blade with a handful of dry grass sheathing it he looked down the slope. He called out, his deep, powerful voice carrying a hint of mirth, "Show yourself rock crawler, I'm in no mood for hide and seek, and I believe you owe me your life!"

      Mordin was brought fully alert by a sudden change in the air, the wind shifted to the north, the foul reek of the babhu's matted coat was no longer assaulting his nostrils. The hunter realized he was not downwind of the babhu now, it was downwind of him.   The babhu had stopped dead on the track and was sniffing the air. The beast reared up on its massive legs, nostrils flaring as it caught the scent. Mordin could see the hard muscle beneath the shaggy fur as the babhu threw up it's arms and head back, it's fangs dripping with slime, roared a deafening challenge and charged at the rocks where he hid.  Mordin felt deaths icy hand at his back in the traitorous wind. He forced down his fear with the cold clarity of the born hunter and knocked an arrow to his short hunting bow. Time seemed to slow as he sighted on the babhu's eye, which in its frenzy, now showed white all round the outside. The beast was almost within range of him. He could smell the fetid breath from the gaping maw, dripping with froth. He breathed deeply and drew his bow, held it for a second and loosed his arrow, breathing out slowly as if to guide its course.   The arrow sped towards the fatal point but went wide as the babhu suddenly veered to the right and leaped over Mordins head, screaming a challenge. Mordin rolled onto his back, dropping his bow and reaching for his sword as the beast, dripping spittle and filth passed over him. The babhu landed still yelling its rage but did not turn to face the hunter.    Over its shoulder Mordin could see the object of the babhu's fury. Below the crest of the hill stood a large, muscular man. He was dressed in fine leather armor with bronze on the chest, arms and shins which glinted in the lowering sun. He wore no helm and his long dark hair blew wildly in the rising wind as he raised his sword to answer the beasts challenge.   Realizing that, for the moment, he was safe, Mordin quietly sheathed his blade and, picking up his bow, backed around the rocks. He knew he should leave, he had no loyalty to the stranger and was anxious to be on with his journey, but he was drawn by the something about the man, something he couldn't place and decided to wait and watch.

      Mordin saw the babhu before it saw him. It was coming slowly up the slope, it's huge belly sticking out in front, giving it a strange, rolling gait that was almost comical.   He crouched down lower behind the rocks, glad to be downwind of the creature. The fat, waddling body belied the animal ferocity beneath. The huge, furry paws sheathed claws hard and sharp as steel. The soft, downy face and drooping mustache hid rows of vicious, pointed teeth.   The hunter gingerly ran his hand over the long ragged scar running from his left collar bone to his right hip, remembering how he learned that lesson. When he first came to this strange place, he had been fooled by the babhu. Finding one caught in a man-trap mewling pitifully, a look of hopeless pleading in it's huge, bovine eyes he had taken pity on the creature, thinking it looked harmless enough.   The thing was no sooner free than it attacked him, rending and tearing with its claws, trying to fasten it's sharp teeth into Mordin's throat. It was a long, bloody fight, the hunter finally smashing the babhu's skull with the man-trap he had freed it from. He nearly lost an arm that day but he learned well that nothing could be taken for granted here.

      The last rays of the sun bathed the great city of Maedin’Sai on its proud hill. The towers and roof gardens of the palace were awash with hues of rose and orange and the tall spires were gilded in the fading glory of the sunset. The air shifted and stirred the brightly coloured flags and standards arrayed on the city walls. They snapped suddenly and fluttered in the evening breeze, startling a flock of nesting rooks into the air, where they flew in a great, wheeling black cloud above the palace, blotting out the last of the sun.   The bells of the Temple rang out mournfully in the dusk, calling the faithful to evensong. In the markets and warehouses, traders and merchants closed up for the night. Hawkers of ribbons, trinkets and fancies packed up their barrows and made way for pie sellers and fortune-tellers. Labourers, dockers and craftsmen rolled down their sleeves, downed tools and headed off in to the night.   As the last bell rang out the lamplighters appeared like fireflies across the darkening capitol. Each went about his nightly route leaving a trail of warm, yellow light behind him. The lights moved purposefully, illuminating the main streets in each quarter and the broad thoroughfares linking them together. At last they reached the boulevards around the palace and the rivers of light joined to cast a twinkling, golden net over the city.   Marisa had watched this ritual every night for as long as she could remember and the magic of it had never waned. Standing on her balcony in the palace as the temple bells tolled their last, she followed the course of the lights with shining eyes and was filled with the same sense of awe she had felt when she first watched the scene.  This evening however she felt a new sense of elation and fear at the coming of the lamplighters and the onset of night. She heard the whickering of horses in the east pasture and felt a sudden longing to run out into the fields and ride the young ponies bareback through the dew as she has as a child. Her every fibre thrilled with anticipation, tonight all was change. Today was her sixteenth birthday and, after evensong, her naming ceremony would be held in the Great Hall of the Palace; tonight she would become a true Princess.   The Princess composed herself and turned from the view. She walked gracefully through the drifting gauze curtains and into her bedchamber where Sherrin, her maid, and lifelong companion, waited impatiently to dress her. The maid raised one eyebrow in a familiar show of disapproval as Marisa entered. She was about to speak when the Princess smiled and held up her hand in mock remorse.   "I know, Sherrin," she laughed, "I shan’t be late, not tonight. I just wanted to collect my thoughts".   Sherrin’s look became a frown, "Sit down Mari," she said, using her private name for the girl she had served from birth, "It’s almost time. You know how I hate to rush."   Marisa sat down at the dressing table and handed a large silver-backed brush to the maid, trying to look chastised. Sherrin rolled her eyes but could not help a small indulgent smile in the mirror as she brushed the dark river of her mistress’s hair to a lustrous shine.   Sherrin pinned up Marisa’s hair with a myriad of sapphire and diamond headed pins, leaving a few midnight tendrils to curl becomingly at the nape of the Princess’s neck. She then helped Marisa into a flowing gown of the darkest blue velvet; deftly fastening the hundred tiny, blue-glass beads that buttoned up the back of the bodice, tying the silk ribbons at the wrists of the long, draping sleeves and lastly, arranging the train, its hem glittering with sapphires.   Sherrin rose from her final adjustments and stood back. Marisa gazed at her transformation in the long mirror, she was amazed how her dark blue eyes shone in her pale, oval face, brighter than her sapphires; her powdered bosom rose and fell visibly with her every breath and her neck arched swanlike from her bare shoulders. Her cheeks coloured as she saw Sherrin watching her, beaming with pride.   There was a knock at the door and both women started in surprise. Marisa moved to the older woman’s side and clasped her hand tightly for a moment. Then she breathed deeply, and said in a clear voice, "I am ready, let it begin".   At those words the doors swung open, the guards on either side came smartly to attention and Marisa walked out to meet the two purple-robed and hooded priests who awaited her.

      This poem was inspired by a painting.  BOUGUEREAU’S CUPIDON  The gentle bronze curling tendrils, soft hues of her hair.  Naked, coyly covering with pinkened arms her modesty.  Skin tickled by her own  feathered wings,  quivering, folded,  not yet ready to fly.  Eyes of a woman set  in the gentle face of  a child.

      Leon walked out of the building where Dr. Conran's office was housed and on, down the street in a slow, purposeless gait. He pulled the bottle from his waistband and took a long pull on it, not caring who saw him retching when the poorly refined alcohol seared his throat and burned down into his already churning stomach. He wandered down the street, baring left down a dank looking alleyway, to get out of the sun and the jarring presence of other people. His mind was spinning with frustration and boiling with hatred for everyone, because they did not suffer as he did.  "Do other people think like this?” he muttered to himself. “Do they have these thoughts running through their brains, almost too fast to catch; the lightening vision of the woman behind the desk, her face smashed in by your own hands; the flash shot of the pathetic, self-pitying man, strangled and choking under your grip?” His head reeled and spun and he leant against the wall shaking violently.   “Oh Christ...” he moaned. “I can’t take this emptiness, this pain, the noises in my head.  Am I capable of these things I see, this violence? Am I really so far over the edge?”  Leon was gripping the vodka bottle harder and harder as his panic rose. Suddenly, with a screaming flash of pain, it broke, plunging slivers of glass deep into his hand. Crying out in pain, he sank down the wall and clawed desperately at his hand. Thick, dark blood was oozing from severed veins and he crouched weeping and pulling at a long shard buried deep in the soft flesh of his palm.  As he slumped in the dirt, cradling his hand, he didn’t notice the footsteps approaching down the alley from the darkness. Only when a wrinkled but manicured hand reached down and pressed an expensive looking crimson handkerchief to his wound, did he even realise there was anyone there. He started with surprise and a dart of fresh pain at the touch, the fabric felt warm, making his skin tingle and the fire of the alcohol in the wound lessened.  Confused and dazed from hunger, drink and loss of blood, Leon attempted to get to his feet, but found himself being gently, but firmly held in place. A soft, elderly voice spoke to him, “Don’t get up, stay there and rest for a moment. You’ve had a shock and a nasty one too.” The old man spoke with a slight accent that Leon couldn’t quite place, but that reminded him of old films and midnight mass; he had an air of confidence and solidity.  Leon looked up slowly, noticing the man’s expensive, Cuban heeled boots, mainly because they contrasted so much with the aged, slightly shabby Italian suit and white silk scarf he also wore. Somewhere in the back of his mind Leon could hear the heartbeat again, and the question, ‘What is this strange figure doing here, where did he come from?’. But the two began to blend into one, the heartbeat confusing his thought and when the old man spoke again he seized the sound, as it floated on the foul air, as though he were drowning.  “You’re in pain aren’t you”, the man said.  “Yes,” Leon whispered, “agony.” His voice was thick, he felt powerless and his mind was numb.   The old man knelt down next to him and put his hands under Leon’s arms. He was incredibly strong. “Here, let me help you," he said, but it was more of a command. Leon had neither the strength nor inclination to resist and the old man lifted him easily to his feet. “I think I may be able to give you something for you'r pain," the old man said softly, as he helped Leon onto unsteady legs.  Leon looked down at his shredded hand; blood was starting to seep through the handkerchief, turning the crimson fabric black. “I think I need to get to a hospital”, he said weakly.  The old man looked confused for a moment then smiled to himself. “Oh that?” he scoffed, “That’s nothing. Look, it starts to heal already!” the old man unwrapped the wound and Leon saw that not only had the bleeding stopped, but he cuts were shallow, pink and fleshy looking, as they should look after weeks of care and healing. He was so surprised by this, turning his hand over and over, that he didn’t see the old man’s smile broaden as he folded his handkerchief neatly and replaced it in the pocket of his suit.  “But...how? I...I don’t understand”, Leon stuttered.  “All in good time," the old man replied. “Don’t you want me to help you?”  Leon looked at him. “No-one can help me,” he said. “I’m in my own, private hell.” He spoke without a trace of drama. Simply stating his life as he saw it, raw and painful. The old man stared at him and for the first time Leon noticed his eyes. They were almost totally black with a flash of fire deep in the pupils and Leon was trapped by the stare like a frightened animal. “Who are you?”, he asked, trembling.   The old man didn’t answer but held Leon in his stare, as if weighing him up. After a moment longer, he spoke, his voice low but full of resonance and portent. “I can give you what you want.”  “But how do you...”, Leon began, but the old man stopped him.  “I know what it is you desire and I can give it to you, but you must surrender yourself completely and question nothing I ask of you.”  Leon nodded mutely, unable to argue or assert himself under that powerful gaze. He was enthralled by this man. The world began to recede from his vision, as though he were no longer part of it. Finally he managed to whisper, “Anything, anything, but please, help me”.  The infant heartbeat was weak in his head now and grew weaker with every step, as the old man led him down the alley. He had a vague notion that they were moving away from the street, and felling a wave of fear, he asked, “Where are we going?”.  The old man replied soothingly, “Just a little further. I have such wonderful things to show you”.  “But...who are you?” Leon asked, “And how did you...”  “Hush! Enough questions” the old man cut him off. “I know you have pain and wish to ease it, that is enough. As for me, you may call me Bâldios.”  Leon felt himself giving his trust totally to this strange man. He surrendered to the sway and the overpowering desire to see everything Bâldios had to show him.

      With a low chuckle Brynath sat down on the grass to examine his wound, ignoring the carcass of the babhu nearby.   Mordin emerged cautiously from his hiding place and walked towards the warrior who was now searching in his belt pouch for something. Feeling a sudden, unexpected wave of shame for not having aided the now wounded man, Mordin quickened his pace. He skirted the body of the babhu, and squatting down before the warrior, offered him his water skin.    Up close Mordin could see that the babhu should have been no match for the swordsman.  The hard, corded muscles stood out on his arms and legs. His hands, big enough to crush a mans head, worked with amazing skill and dexterity as he daubed salve on his wound and deftly stitched the flesh with a needle and sinew from his pouch. The man’s bronzed skin was marked by the scars of battle, some, Mordin judged, from their size, would have been enough to kill most men on their own. Mordin could also see that the warriors armour; though polished and well cared for, it bore battle scars as numerous as the man and the leather was soft and worn in places, through long, hard use.    Reaching out to take the water skin Brynath nodded to Mordin to sit. He took a long draught, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and with a grin, threw the skin back to Mordin, who had seated himself warily on the grass.   Mordin caught the skin in mid-air but looked away when the warrior sought his eyes. Seeing Mordin's discomfort, Brynath's grin widened.  “Fear not hunter" he laughed, “I account you no blame for my injury. If I were less travel worn I would never have let that monster gore me.”   A slight tightening around his eyes was all that betrayed his pain as Brynath settled himself into a cross-legged position. He reached into his belt pouch again and drew out two shrivelled winter apples. Tossing one to Mordin, he proceeded to devour his own with relish.   As the stranger had yet shown him no malice, and not wishing to offend him, Mordin bit gingerly into the apples brown, wrinkled flesh. He was overwhelmed with surprise by the rush of flavour and sensation. Inside its skin the fruit was soft and thirst quenchingly moist. The rich juices slaked his thirst like the purest spring water. His mouth was filled with the tart sweetness of early apples and the mellow warmth of wild berries. He lingered over the succulent flesh, savouring every bite and felt as full as after a feastday banquet. He felt the weariness he had so long carried ease gently and warmth coursed through his limbs.  His heart and mind were lifted, his body invigorated, as though a great weight had been removed.  He finished the apple, licking the last drops of juice from his fingers like a hungry child, then suddenly remembered he was in company. Looking up he saw the warrior studying him and smiling.   “What was that, it was wonderful?” he asked, “I feel... renewed!” Brynath nodded,   “Apples, nothing more,” he replied. “They were given to me by a noble Lady as a parting gift, nurtured by her own hand. They used to grow wild in these parts, many years ago. I hope they will again.”  Feeling emboldened by the new energy in his body and mind, Mordin held the dark gaze for a moment. Despite the battle scars, and the hardened body, he could sense no evil in the swordsman. His eyes were black and hard as onyx, but glittered with life. The strong jawed, sun-darkened face was softened by the smile, and Mordin felt no fear of him. ‘I at least owe him some thanks,’ he thought.  “My apologies for not coming to your aid sooner,” he began.  The warrior laughed again.  “No need for that" he smiled. “As I said, it should have been no contest, but I am travel worn and a little battle weary.” He paused and looked out across the rolling hills to where the sun was at last melting into the horizon, pouring liquid gold and fire into the sky.   “I was foolish,” he said with a derisory chuckle. “I have been many days without sleep, but I was invigorated by the site of my homeland after a long absence. Walking these hills made me feel like a boy again."  Glancing at the body of the body of the babhu, he shook his head. “Only a boy or a fool would have been careless enough to let his guard down like that.”  Looking back to the hunter, he nodded and gestured for him to continue. Mordin raised his hand in grateful agreement that the matter was settled.    “I feel I should at the least introduce myself,” he said. “I am Mordin Cauldannen, a hunter, and a traveller in these lands." Remembering the near ecstasy of the apple, he continued. “I thank you for your generosity. I fear water and some black bread are all I may offer in return, and I do not think they will stand up to comparison.”  At this both men laughed together and the final thread of tension seemed broken.  Mordin held out his hand, the swordsman responded, each gripping the other by the forearm.    “Well met Mordin Cauldannen”, said Brynath. “I am Brynath Noraelin, and I see from your face you have heard of me before.”  At the sound of the name all colour had drained from Mordin's face. Even his schooled expression could not hide his shock. Brynath Noraelin, brother of the king, Commander of the Southern Armies, had returned to the land of his birth.

      “But what did you see when you blacked out?” Leon eyed the woman for a moment before answering.  “Darkness,” he replied bitterly.  “Nothing else? Are you sure? Perhaps you just don’t remember?” The psychologist was simply unwilling to accept what Leon was telling her. Everybody dreamed. Why, a person would go insane if...Leon interrupted her thoughts, angered by her inability to comprehend his problem.  “I don’t remember anything because there’s nothing to remember!” he snarled. “I have never been able to dream. Believe me, if there was any chance it was my memory at fault, I ruled it out years ago!” Dr. Conran appeared visibly shock by Leon’s outburst and his tone softened slightly, but lost none of its bitterness. “I’m in pain doctor, I need help.”  He must have caught the look of scepticism on her face because his voice became filled with anger once again. “I suppose you think this is just a minor flaw, an inconvenience, don’t you?” he blasted. “You see visions every night! Lives and lands and futures in all the colours imaginable. You can have your entire psyche mapped out by Freud or Jung, or some other great mind.”  Leon seethed as he spoke these last words. His pain and frustration were etched on his face. Dr. Conran felt almost cowed. Leon sighed heavily, sinking back into his own private darkness. He went on in a low, emotionless voice; “You divine your hopes, fears, desires, all from the images your subconscious creates. Communion with lost loves and ideas, ease from pain and suffering, guilt and remorse alike. Faith restoring visions, prophecy and so mush more, things I will never experience.”   He laid his head back on the chair, his eyes distant, lost. “In those tiny, snatched moments in the arms of Morpheus, you can find release.” Bitter tears of self-loathing and despair were coursing down Leon’s face and he turned away from the doctor, his shame and disgust palpable.  Dr. Conran paused for a moment, unsure how to continue. This man was clearly in distress, probably suffering from severe depression, not to mention agoraphobia and paranoia. But, could all this be caused by his claimed inability to access the dream state that the rest of the world could enter at will?  “Perhaps..." she began tentatively, “I could give you something to relax you, to help you sleep more...restfully.” Leon had begun to laugh before the doctor had even finished her sentence. Tears again ran down his face, it was a vitriolic laugh, a laugh totally void of humour.  “I wish you could,” he said unsmiling, “but I’ve been sown that road before. I’ve probably taken enough drugs legal and illegal, to kill most people, some even you won’t have heard of.  But none of it makes any difference, nothing can kill the need inside me for something real, something mine.”  Dr. Conran took in Leon’s dishevelled appearance; the wild, despairing look in his eyes, the terrible pits and scars on his pale, exposed forearms and for the first time, she notices the half drunk bottle of cheap vodka sticking out from the waistband of his greasy trousers. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of the bottle and any belief in Leon’s bizarre problem vanished. Leon read this in her face and stood up resignedly to go.  “Thanks anyway Doctor" he murmured, head down, moving towards the door. “I’m used to this kind of reaction, but I’d hoped things might have changed by now.”   As he reached the door and was about to walk through the doctor spoke. “Leon, if all those drugs made no difference, why the drink? Why destroy yourself so futilely?”  Leon stopped on the threshold, his head still down and without turning he replied, in a  flat voice, “What would you do?”

      Leon staggered from the bar into the freezing, early morning dark, and headed towards the train station. His eyes were sore and his vision blurred form spending the night and most of the previous day in the dim, smoke filled pup. His stomach burned from the evil tasting vodka he’d drunk, and lack of food. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten. 	 He wandered almost blindly, trusting his instinct to guide him in the right direction. Passing through the Market Square, the pervading stench of day old fish and vegetables on the turn insinuated into his nostrils. It was almost more than he could do to hold down the contents of his gut. 	 As he stumbled on, his skin a pallid green colour, his breath coming in thick gasps, he felt the suspicious gazes light upon him and flick away nervously. The night worker on their way home and the early morning shift workers eyed him warily. He was on intruder into their time: he did not belong in their twilight world. 	 Leon hurried on, trying to keep out of view, not feeling fit to be seen and shying away from the few passing people. Not catching their eyes. He felt naked and vulnerable as he moved out into the open main street. In a few hours it would be hot and filled with the fumes and bustle of the working day. Now however, it was barren, bereft of people, a vast tract of emptiness. Even the cars were few and sped past in tight groups, the glow of their low headlights making them alien and surreal. 	 Finally, just as he felt the world was about to close in on him, his fears beginning to crush the fragile shell of his sanity, Leon reached the relative safety of the station. He hurried through the one gate not chained up for the night and into the damp, urine smelling cave of the tunnel leading to the platforms. 	 Inside the tunnel he felt suddenly alone, totally cut off from the rest of the world. He could hear the rumble of an approaching train like a heartbeat in utero, pounding fluidly into his brain.   ‘Sleep,’ he thought feverishly, ‘I need to sleep’, and he staggered out onto the platform. It was dark. Lights that had steadily burned out had never been replaced and the thick warm darkness of the subway was slowly engulfing the little used station. Like the slow moving body of some unfathomable malevolent entity.  Leon could feel himself slipping, his mind sliding, the reality in front on him bending and melting. The darkness seemed to ebb and flow, the sound of the infant heartbeat growing louder in his ears. The cloying warmth around him seemed to pull at him, drawing him back to the womb. He heard a voice dry out in pain and terror and numbly recognised it as his own as the darkness enfolded him.

						   For a long time I have had, near the top of the list, Dentists.   Now I'm sure a lot of you feel, Dentists are horrid, scary torturers. No offence intended to the dentists out there, I'm sure you don't all inflict pain. I wish you no harm, but in the same way I wish a great, hairy spider no harm. That doesn't stop me screaming like a girl and running in the opposite direction should I come near either of you.  The difference here is, I don't have a phobia of dentists, I have a perfectly rational fear of them. It's perfectly normal to be frightened of somebody who tries to drill your fillings and extract a wisdom tooth without anesthetic, undeterred by the squealing and writhing of the patient, and who can only be induced to stop by a boot in the chest. It's also normal to be rather reluctant to put oneself in that position again.   However, having suffered overlong through the annual, jaw breaking,  wisdom-teething I call "the season of the tooth", I feel it is time to face my fear. It is after all a rational one and can therefore be rationalized, and defeated. The only problem is, none of the bastards are signing up new patients!  That's it back to the top of the list with you!

						   I've said it a thousand times, "That's it! They've made the list!". Who doesn't have a mental black list of people, companies, and mindless crap that's p'd them off? Well it's time to name and shame!   Join with me!   As that great philosopher Homercles once said, "...and verily, we shalt stick it to the man!"  Today I would like to add NTL to the list.  After sending off my CV in hope of some response, maybe even an interview, I received not one but TWO letters, on the same day, saying, "no, we don't want to interview you". The no didn't bother me, you get a lot of that, but two letters? On the same day? Both signed by the same incompetent pen pusher! That's just rubbing it in!   I would also like to add N-Power.  When I foolishly agreed to change my electricity supply over to them, they not only signed up the wrong meter, and charged me for the guy downstairs' electricity, they then ignored me and kept me on hold for two hours! I know why didn't I hang up, but you know how it is the longer you wait, the more wrath you have invested in it and the harder it is to admit defeat, besides, surely somebody has to pick up in a minute! As if that wasn't bad enough, I had to pay the bill, and TWO YEARS later, they sent me another one, and I DIDN'T EVEN LIVE THERE ANY MORE!!

						   I found this on a Vegetarian Resource site, grim.     What is cysteine/cystine?  Also known as l-cystine, our research indicates that the source of cysteine is human hair. Cystine is an amino acid needed by humans, which can be produced by the human body. A very small quantity is used in less than 5% of all bread products. Often the hair of third world women is used.        &nbsp;  Think I'll be checking my labels *very* carefully in future.

						      Ugh... I feel nubbish!        &nbsp;   When I find out where these germs came from there is going to be trouble!     &nbsp;   After much whinging, coughing and whimpering, I finally managed to edit and post the new LL chapter. Once I'd left it alone for a bit it didn't seem nearly as crap as I at first thought. Must keep going!     &nbsp;   Despite the lurgy the Beloved Beard and I got to be mini-heroes on Friday. We were taking Mr.Beard to work, about 2mins from home, going up the really steep hill known as "Bonk Brow". A woman coming the other way lost control on the corner at the top of the hill, spun, hit the wall and a lamp-post and ended up on the wrong side of the road, just up from our car.     &nbsp;   It was all a bit surreal, it looked at first like she was trying to do a handbrake turn and screwed it up, then the car was all over the place, moving in a really unnatural way, and bouncing off things like a pinball.   &nbsp;   Of course we did the honorable thing and went to her aid, unbelievably she didn't have a scratch on her. Lucky girl. The copper and ambulance crew were up to their usual standard, the dispatch office didn't even&nbsp;know where we were, IT'S A MAIN ROAD PEOPLE!! But hey, we did our bit.     &nbsp;   What I couldn't believe was the amount of people who tried to push their cars past, with a 10ft drop on one side just to get to work, some bleend even asked why we couldn't push the car out of his way! The coppers hadn't even arrived yet!!     &nbsp;    *sigh*   stupidity abounds.      &nbsp;    I'm currently listening to "Dub Side Of the Moon".  UNREAL!!!

						   Written 02.10 11/07/04  My beloved Beard often warns me about the dangers of the adjective and its overuse. He tells me I must e careful about 'pairing up' and waffling descriptions. I agree with him, as you may have noticed I can go on a bit, that's why I'm here. I also agree that it's really annoying when you get a sentence, a paragraph long, that has so many adjectives it reads like iambic pentametre. Most importantly I find it very difficult to control my commas, they keep popping up, unbidden, in the middle of a sentence, scurry about the page, causing trouble with the other punctuation marks. They're frankly impossible.   Ahh, that's better.  Signing off ---02.17 ---

						   Written 01.37 11/07/04  Right! I'm back. Sorry for neglecting you, I've been fending off trolls on Endless and tending to a sick beard. (Poor chuck has the flu, bless'im)  I have also been sitting in the park trying to thrash out the background for Lance Lord. (Still waiting for title ideas people, come on, the more you read it, the crappier it looks, I NEED A NEW ONE!!)  I've been trying to write the story and struggling a bit. I'm not used to writing about girly things like dresses and hair-do's. I'm trying very hard not to go all mills&boon or bodice-ripper in the narrative.   I'm pissed of that I thought of a really good name for the king and now I can't remember it. I have decided to make endnotes whenever I think of an idea that I can't use at that point so it won't bloody happen again!  I've also decided to keep open Notepad to 'pre-blog' when I'm not on net, I find a bit of a rant helps me tune my thoughts when I get stuck, but it's a pain in th'arse logging on and off all the time.   Just trying to think of names for the local god and I had the remarkably stupid thought of calling him/her/it Aileron. Well it does sound good for a second, very noble and, um... godlike (?). Quite unfortunate really.   I must look up the etymology of the word 'aileron' (bet that's not how you spell it). Will blog later with findings.  Signing off --- 01.50 ---

						   *seethe*.   the worst bit about writing is thinking of names and titles. Everything you come up with has been used by someone else, or sounds too cheesy, or , when you read it back 2 hours later, sounds like something rather rude that you hadn't,'t noticed until then.  I'm currently struggling for a new title for "Lance Lord". The story was called "Land of the Babhu", but the whole thing's moved on now and that doesn't fit anymore.   I re-named it "Lance Lord" in a fit of pique after sitting for three hours staring at the blank space where the title used to be. I knew it wasn't right, and I had a feeling I'd pinched it off somebody but I'd just about had enough, and thought it would do for now.  Imagine my ire when Dave (my beloved other half, pet beard, and editor), said it sounded like slang for somebody's old chap. He couldn't read the rest of it for giggling.  18 hours and several brews and tantrums later I still can't think of anything. Worse, all I can think of now is progressively more ridiculous euphemisms for somebody's old chap!  Any suggestions people? Please.....!!!??

I'm going to make myself another brew and get down to some serious writing. I've left it too long already. It's not even lack of ideas now, it's just getting the bits I the right order to post them.

						   I expect you've heard about the new government information booklet on emergencies. Well mine's just dropped onto the doormat and what a strange text it is. On every page there is a rather unflattering photo of an 'expert' with a quote, and some 'helpful' tips. As expected, the "Helping to prevent a terrorist attack" page is the most worrying. According to them these are the possible signs of terrorism:   Terrorists need...  A place to live: Are you suspicious about any tenants or guests?  To plan: Have you seen anyone pay an unusual amount of attention to security measures at ay location?  Money: Individuals may set up bogus bank accounts, copy credit cards, return goods for large cash refunds.  Equipment: If you are a retailer, do you have any cause to be suspicious about anything being bought? (Source:HM Government "Preparing For Emergencies:What you need to know, 2004)    So, houseguests must be vetted, and anyone who's hard up for cash, studying politics, security guards, conspiracy nuts, and every oddball who walks into a hardware shop must be treated with suspicion.I know we have to be aware of genuine threats, but at this rate the country will be overrun with Quizlings. Careful folks, Big Brother is watching.

						   *sigh* Can't get the memory card reader for the camera to work. I'll have to wait until Mr. Minkon comes home. LOL, the ratties wouldn't hold still for their mugshots anyway.  I have found a new webcounter, huzzah! I tried to find a ratty one but the little meeces are quite cute aren't they?     In other news:    I had a bit of an accident on Friday, I managed to fall off the stairs, again. I really thought I'd broken my foot, it was really sore and bruised and my ankle looked horrible. Luckily, after a bit of a rest it seems ok. Thank Buddha! I really didn't want to go to the Local A&amp;E, I'd rather go to the vets! I would have been rather p'd off if it was broken, I've only just stopped limping from the last time.    Still listening to: Radio 4     I've tried to sign up for their forum but the registration thingy doesn't work.

						   YEY! Speffle came to visit this weekend and fun was had by all! I'm still finding bits of grass, I demand a grass wars rematch Speffles!  The wee ratties were so tuckered out from all the excitement that they slept all sunday afternoon till 9pm. Awwwww.  I'm going to have a play with the digital camera in a minute, so hopefully there will be some rattie pictures up here soon.  Back shortly, (hopefully with a Milton Mugshot and a Jenkins JPG)

						   Ever have a tune, some lyrics or a quote bouncing around in your head in a really anoying way? How mush worse is it when you don't know what it's from? I've had this boinging off the inside of my skull for hours:      Must go, must fly, don't drink yourselves to death, but the baby is allergic to the babysitter's breath and by now she'll have her boyfriend in a vice-like grip, on the backgammon table, sucking guacamole dip through the holes in his stockings. Isn't it shocking?   I'm kicking myself now that I've remembered what it is. But, does anybody else know?

						   Written 30/07/04 12:11pm  I'm feeling much better, finally. Must get back to writing! I've been busy drawing Nemesis the Warlock I'm afraid, I can't believe I can actually draw!! When Mr. Beard and I eventually get the scanner working I'll post some pics.  Still job hunting, it SUCKS, end of.  Bought a new tootle stick! It's very flashy, painted black with gold finishings, lovely tone as well. It's a Clarke, and I highly recommend it. *Touch-wood* I'm not allergic to it yet.

Currently Listening to Radio 4. I just find it very relaxing and the shipping forecast has always helped me get to sleep, ask anyone from my halls in uni, I used to drive them mad with it.       The Dalai Lama's words for the day are     World peace through inner peace, not through weapons. So ultimately we should have one clear vision: demiliterize the world.
