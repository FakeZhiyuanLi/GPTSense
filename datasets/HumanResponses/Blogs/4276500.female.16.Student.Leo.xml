      Got back my chem marks today..41/50..tomorrow is Additional maths...don't think can pass.Always careless!!!!!!Anyway...today's paper also pretty bad..E maths and Bio can pass but not very good i can say...i just hate that plants chapter!!!I love heredity though..:).Oh..and Li Jia wei lost!!!!Guess not much confidence over there..she looked quite nervous..Haiz...there's goes everything..let's wish her all the best for 2008. And...I think my blog is real boring...so i figured thinking of a topic every week and we should all comment on it...and the theme changes every week. So i think this week i'll give the topic as.."What do you think about Singapore idols?"yep..either comment or tag your comments ;). Oh and I bought BoA's new album today!!Though her new look seems intimadating...too matured and wild...but it's alright..her songs are great(of course).Still can't find Diana Degarmo's single probably haven't sold here yet..

      Can't believe it...Li Jia Wei actually lost!!!Haiz..I knew it at the last game..I had a very strong feeling that she'll lose to Korea..I could see the triumphic face on her opponent...the cheering at the end...
