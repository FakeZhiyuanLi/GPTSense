      Today my friends and I painted our sunday school room.  It was loads of fun.  Although at first it was a little rough at the start because I was not on the greatest terms with one of them, I got along with them at the end and we had a great time.  If I haven't learned anything at all today, at least I learned these two things.  Number one, I cannot do trim, I always mess up (lol, just kidding).  The second and more serious one is, just because you don't get along with someone or aren't on their best side.  There are always things to do to make it better.  I am not going to say that it will always be like that, but when you take the time and set your differences, or fights aside it makes the day much more enjoyable.  I don't know if it will go on.  Right now it is lasting, but we had a lot of tension at the beginning of the day and at the end we were laughing with everybody else and we all had a REALLY great time.  I don't know aobut you, but I was sort of surprised that the day worked out so well.  The room looks great and all of our spirits are soaring.  We are ready to fly through the clouds which, by the way, is what our room looks like, clouds!!  Well all, I am going to go for now, I am caked in paint because people thought it funny to put hand prints all over me.  Peace, Much Love, Live long and prosper, and all that other stuff.  P.S. Just cause you don't get along, doesn't mean your day has to be ruined.  ;-)

      Some of us need to stop and just look at our surroundings.  We need to notice the details in the little things, or else we might overlook something and be angry by what we THOUGHT we saw.  For example.  I came home and my brother had taken my room again and so, I got irritated with him, yes, but I went to sleep in his room nevertheless.  I woke up this morning ready to go downstairs and say goodmorning.  Well, nobody knew I had been home for the whole night.  I could have died and nobody would have known.  They thought that my brother, was sound asleep in his own bed.  They never took the time to look at the face with her eyes closed.  They just assumed.  Then when my brother came from the basement, nobody thought to think, 'OH he slept in the basement that much be Sunny in his room.'  No, I went unnoticed.  Mom and Dad were angry at me when I walked into the room to say goodmorning.  There questions were, "where did you come from?  Where have you been?"  I felt stupid when I had to tell them.  I was in Artie's room sleeping because he took mine.  You know, if people would take time to notice the simple things in life like the fact that I have hair and Artie doesn't so how could I be Artie, then the world would probably run a whole lot smoother in the long run.  And just think, if you do take time and slow down to look at things, the world is a whole lot more beautiful.  Well, do you want another example?   My brother (the one in my room) just came in the house and he walked up to me and asked me if I knew who's clothes he was wearing.  I thought they were his.  No, he was wearing my mother's shirt and my mother's jeans.  If he would have taken notice and thought, 'these jeans are way too long for me' then he should have known not to put them on to give them to someone else because he knew they were not his.  The only thing that could have thrown him off is that the jeans fit him around the waste.  He is 11 years old and wearing my mother's clothes.  Hmm...  I know that these things are simple, but they make a difference nevertheless.  I must go and pick out my little brother's clothes for now.  BBQ to go to tongight.  Yeah!  REMEMBER: take time to look around...find out what you see.

      I feel like as though I am in a car ride.  I am never going to stop.  Sometimes, the car gets off course and I crash and burn, but somehow, I always seem to find my way out of that situation and back onto the road.  I know that it didn't always seem like I was making any progress.  It didn't seem like I was an actual Christian because I was having so much trouble.  Well, I wasn't.  I was having troubles relying on GOD.  For a while now, I have been relying on myself and nobody else to do things to help me with things.  But then, I got into one fine mess.  GOD had to send someone to clean it up.  Only a few people came to my rescue.  These select few have helped me get out of that mess, out of the grasps of Satan.  It has taken a few years, but they are working with me and we are all working with GOD to return my life to what it should be.  Well, at least what would be best for me.  They have helped me more than I think anyone could have ever helped me.  I know that you may think that I'm just doubting everybody else.  I'm not.  Anybody can do anything they want.  I know that, I've sort of learned that.  What I am talking about though is the fact that, even though, they know I don't want to hear it and even though it is something that they don't want to tell me.  It is something I have to know.  They are open, they don't tell me anything that is a lie.  They have become like a mother and father to me and I shall forever be grateful to them both.  I believe that if I stick with them, I will grow and prosper forever.  I can do anything with GOD, my adopted mother, and my adopted father.  We are all helping hands to each other.  They are the best ones anyone could ever have.  IT IS ALL GOD!!

      What is right and what is wrong when all you are doing is reading a book?  I read loads of books about mythologic creatures.  I never thought them as wrong, but sometime ago, I just kept listening to those around me(more than usual) and some of them are against it.  They say that it is wrong to read Harry Potter.  It will corrupt my mind as my grandmother tells me.  I don't understand.  If you know that the book is not true, and you know that none of it could be real, then what is the problem?  I like the imagination of the people who write these books.  I never would have thought to think up this kind of stuff.  I have a pretty out there imagination too.  I don't exactly understand.  Maybe their parents were the same way and they just drilled it into their kids' mind.  I don't understand why they would do it though.  I would be happy if my kid were just plain reading.  I believe that if you talk to your child and they understand that it is not real, then you should let them read it.  I mean, I just don't really get it.  I understand that that is what some people believe, but is that the right way?   Am I wrong for reading those books?  What is right when it comes to these kinds of books?  What's wrong?

      I just had a chance today to visit someplace that I thought I would never be.  I went to a school in the Kansas City district.  Now you may think, okay and what is so great about that?  Well, I will just tell you.  It was VERY different.  The school is mostly black populated.  I met a lot of the students.  I was very impressed.  That is not at all how I thought they would act, or how I thought things would go.  They acted exactly like I would have acted (most of them).  They were talkative, helpful, and didn't give much lip.  I imagined them a lot worse.  I just received a feeling first hand of how not to judge a book by it's cover.  It was sort of hard for me to walk into that school and meet them with an open mind.  I kept thinking that I would have to watch my back from what I heard of them.  They have a metal detector that you have to walk through when you first get into school.  It was scary to walk through.  You had to sign in and sign out and they had to know what you were doing, why you were there.  I was scared to death.  At first, everytime one of the students walked by me or was in my view, I was VERY cautious.  I had to keep my mind open though.  I found that if I stayed with Grant, I was fine.  So, ha ha, I stuck by grant the entire time of the first few hours.  I finally figured out that everything was okay and when I met a few of the people.  It was awesome to talk to them when they were going the same direction.  They are the exact same as you and me.  The only difference is that their ancestors were born a lot closer to the equator.  I don't know if that is what makes you black or not, but I was just throwing that in there.  Anyways, I just wanted to say, that all those times people say, don't judge a book by it's cover.  It's true.  Be open-minded.  You'll feel better in the long run and you might just move a step forward on your journey through life.
