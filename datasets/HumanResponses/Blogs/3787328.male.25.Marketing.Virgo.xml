      there is a great saying in estonian(topic) - translated to english it would be something like "the roof is flying" thats what i feel now mind keeps mumbling about million different things and the only think i know is that i cant focus on anything - somehow bored/tired/overenergetic/and so on  . o O (million different things...)  &nbsp;

THEY ARE MY BEST FRIENDS....   /me takes the deepest bow ever   if I wouldnt have my friends i would be like 15% of myself....   They.....  You.....  have made me what I am   &nbsp;  (yes i did give the link to one of my best friend ;) )  [we will see if she will comment anything... or even tell me that she remembers the link :p ]

      what is love?  what is friendship?  why do you have to give up something to gain something? why the hell i am still awake at 5am? why there is a command "Sign Out" in blog instead of "Get A Life"? ;) &nbsp; (thoughts of a two night period - one night out till 5am and other night at home with candlelight and dry red wine still till 5am) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      just sitting infront of my PC and .... found a great blog today... which is written very well  http://nanooq.blogspot.com/ (in estonian thou)  how great it would be if I would have the ability to see everything from outside .. thinking rationally and not feeling attached to some things or ppl  just remembered.... WORK it would be nice to have 48 hours in one day instead of 24

      always try to remember what day of the week it is... i am already all mixed up ... saying to some folks she instead of he and 'vice versa' and thats not polite and that disturbs me  wanna be like ... umm ... good? or atleast keep the mask ;) did i already told about the Masked Man? i did? good   i didnt? to bad for you :p  something Deep to the end of this post:  Time There is no moment, better or worse. But for a moment that we now share. What has once started, itâ€™ll have no ending. Beauty is lasting, ugliness pending.

      looks like i am discovering poetry again for myself - JUST FOR ME  sometimes i can get lost in some poems and i even dont wanna show anyone that i am lost just keep the feeling of the poem and enjoy it alone, because i am afraid that if i tell the feeling to someone i would feel kind of too naked...  i am just the man that ppl see in me ... i dont mind that they dont know the real me but i just wanna know why they think i am that kind as they see me  its like circus for me ... discover what aspects did ppl noticed and what they missed  ..kinda like contolfreak ....  and i will never let someone say that its bad ...  someone said it first that i am the Masked Man ... i cant remember who was the first...

      its morning and i have just woke up jumping off bed because i had a feeling i slept in - thank god i didnt :)  just have a long day ahead of me and *hopefully* busy evening/night LOL as it seems i just might see a girl x tonight and that might mean that i am very sleepy tomorrow at work and totally sleepy tomorrow night when i have already other date..... ... why do I have a feeling that my private life grows over me? no no i dont mind that ;)  just wondering should i give link to this blog to someone more special than all the girls....  someone once said: girls will come and girls might go but friends always stay.... life is like decision after decision *wink*

      just three day till vacation... i just might survive if ppl gimme some freedom and they wont try to understand things without thinking and knowing me....  its hard to get to know of new sides of your friends when you couldnt even think that they could be so narrow-minded  maybe it just mean that i am not better than they think? and right now they think like i am as bad as one man can be...  but if you think... then i(you) know that i am BETTER! theres the difference

      you ca try to WIN but thats impossible like in Murphy's law thats all just an illusion yeah and i am the best liar of all times there are moments when you need a Friend and then you will realize that you just have yourself and nothing more because you have drinken all the alcohol and a lot of more listening to sad music and theres aint anybody who will listen you.. well there is ppl who would listen you... and being able to help, not you just dont want to put all the burden on theirs shoulders i have like .... ummmm.... atleast 3 persons i can always turn to (showing my true me to them) maybe i have more maybe i have less just just maybe i have a heart and i just think i dont wanna upset them with MY THOUGHTS about everything i just want to my friends to be happy as it seems i dont have the energy to do that 24h/365d and so on actually it helps when you know they care of you atleast you have that illusion i know they adore me when i make them feel good... and i almost always do that despite that i might not love them the moment thats just my personality... dont wanna change it... just wanna cry out to the world that sometimes i need help too... and because i am me, i need more help than they... and its again my EGO speaking.... I CAN TAKE ALL THE PRESSURE OF THE WORLD BUT SOMETIMES IT GETS TO ME... and then i am sad... like now... truly sad...  ***drink more alcohol and fall asleep - no dreams - no thinking***  i hope that MM doesnt remember the link... (not that i didnt like/love her, but she hasnt deserve the burden I could put on her just trying to be a friend that she would like to be a friend too 24h/365d/and so on)... NO HARM...
