       Hay,    &nbsp;  Well. My friends (Dan, Rach, Heather and others) went on a camp, leaving me alone for 5 days. All alone, with no decent people to talk to, cept my other friends. But, I survived! w00! There back now and I'm so happy! My boredom is offically OVER!    &nbsp;  Oh and yeah, I started that diet. I'm still eating dinner, but in small amounts and I'm not even hungry! w00t! All I have eaten today was a small peice of meat for dinner. Maybe it's working. Some of my friends and there mums from primary skool are saying I look way better and that I have lost weight from last year! IM SO HAPPY! Finally I can be kind of pretty....hopefully. hehe.    &nbsp;  I look terrible at the moment though, I have't slept in the past 3 days. Yes, 3 days striaght. Due to some biatches from my primary skool calling me at 2 in the morning! 2 in the friggen morning! How stupid can some people get, I told them they don't have lifes if there calling me THAT early.    &nbsp;  Well, Im bored and listening to Black Betty and Get Free by The Vines while lookin up pics of Duff McKagan who plays Bass in da band Velvet Revolvers....I loff dere song Slither! It's so MAD! I also like Jets song Cold Hard Bitch. SO MAD!    &nbsp;  Gotta run,   Bridget.

      Hullo,  Today I did nothing, there was no rain, so I couldn't go and lay down in it. I had to stay home, cause my mum went to work and my dog was totally dirty, she had obviously been digging outside and she got my Pj's dirty.  I'm trying to get over my cold, it have gotten worse since yesterday, it was prolly the rain or something. But, yeah. Im takin pills for it. So uhm....yeah.  I also took the National Life Expectancy test last night and it said I was only going to live until im 78, unless I change my life. Which is what im going to do, I might go on one of those non-eating diets, or just eat a healthy dinner and nothing else, then no one would notice. Yeah and I will excerise and stuff. Im also thinking about starting Hip Hop lessons, I did dancing from the age of 4 and stopped when I was 10. So I did it for a long time. I also did it for last year, but then I stopped again.  Well im talking to Dan on MSN so imma go now.  Signing out, Bridget!

      Today I sauntered down to my nearest park in the rain. Yes, in the cold, pelting, wet rain. I was alone, free at last. my parents where at home, watching the football in the warm house and my sister was there to.   As I laid in the soaking wet, lush green grass. The rain cascading from the skies onto my freezing body I felt safe and free. It was just me and the world, alone.  The only sounds that could be heard was my harsh breathing as I caught a worse cold and the thundering of the rain. But, I didn't want to leave, because in that space, that time, for once, all my troubles and pressures just melting away, like I was a free spirit, not a single care in the world.  I know it was probably a stupid thing to do, but it needed to be done, it's like it washed away all my sin and heartbreak. Maybe it was what I needed to get free.   There is a bad side to this experience though, as it reminded me of my Grandma, her smile, her hugs and her warming laughter. It seemed that even though I was in the cold rain, I was somewhat warm, It felt like I was in one of my Gran's most famous hugs that I would recieve on cold winter days or when I was upset. I miss those hugs. I miss her.  When I was in the park, my hair, clothes and body drenched to the bone, I seemed that the trees knew my secrets, they swayed to the rhythm of my heart. It's like I was in my own world, the population was me, and me alone. No one these there to bother me, It was a place I could cry alone, without being judged.  That's what I did, I cried, and cried. Until there was nothing more left inside to cry about. Sometimes it's best to cry, To let out your feelings when no one is around to see you. There where no other kids to laugh at me, or parents to look at me like I'm some kind of weirdo. It was me, myself and I. Free...  I know you people probably think im weird, for crying. But, it hurt to loose two of the people I love, A week after each other. My world just seemed to stop, pause in time, freeze like ice. It was like a dark cloud of nothingness covered all happiness. A cold wind rushed through my life. A tornado ripped all things in my world away, leaving nothing but devistation in it's path. I felt alone, and frustrated. But I also felt angry, why did this happen to me? Was god trying to punish me? Did I do something terribly wrong to someone? I felt like it was my fault they died, maybe if I had told them how much I loved them, or showed it more then they wouldn't have let go. They would still be around and I wouldn't be feeling the way I am.  It feels like I have lost everything, I never got to say goodbye, not before they died, not after they died. I haven't seen them, or spoken to them at all. Maybe if I went to there funerals I would be able to get over some of this. Maybe seing them that last time in my life would have given me some kind of hope?  Ever since the dreaded phonecalls. Where I recieved the news that broke my heart, my world hasn't been the same. It's like everyone hates me, like I have no friends....It feels like the whole damn world is out to get me and I know I won't make it through the day. But, I do make it through everyday. And what makes it worse is knowing I have to wake up again and feel the heartbreak...and pain...all over again.   Well, I must go. I have some things to write down and some people to call. I hope that your life isn't as crap as mine.  Heartbroken, Bridget.

      Ok so another day began and it ended mostly the same as every other day. Crap yet exciting in a way. I went to the movies with some friends (Including Dan) and we saw Shrek 2. It was ok, Dan was asking like a dork. Hehe...Yeah I stole his necklace and started scratching at my hand with it, then I used my nails and I ended up with red hands. It kind of hurt.....but I will deal with it. So anyway. Im really upset at the moment. They had my Gran's funeral and I didn't end up going. Im really upset and mad. How could they do that! She was my fricken Gran for gods sake! I had everything ready! How can people be so rude! Geez! Man! Im so bloomin mad! Well yeah. Im gonna go now, Im talking to Dan on the phone.  Bye for now, Bridget!

      Hi...This is Bridget. I got into this blog thing off a friend. An online friend, who is really nice and funny. And he says he can create all these new and fantastic words. He can actually. But that really isn't important.  So...Today was an interesting day, I went shopping...every girls favourite sport. I brought...stuff...like clothes and stuff...and I met a friend there, a friend from primary school. Her name is Amber. She is cool. One of my besties. She has the cutest lil sis though! Omg! So so adorable!  Uhm yeah....My friend rang me today to...Amanda...She is organising going to the pictures tomorrow with a bunch of my friends (Daniel, Delon, Gemma, Rach, Amanda, Alice and myself) I think thats it. Im not sure. But yeah. One of them, Daniel. I really like him (I hope he doesn't read this). I really, REALLY like him. He is so sweet and caring, but he isn't a sissy. He is really cool. But he likes Amanda, a lot, and I have seen him go out wif 3 of my bestfriends and like 4 or 5 other girls. It kind of hurts, to see him hug them and kiss them when I love him so much, But I guess I will get over it, eventually, I hope.  Im actually kind of feeling crap, Nothing in my life seems to be going right, My gran died...and so did my uncle. Like a week after each other. So it sucks and they already had the funeral for my gran so I missed it! Im so mad at them! How could they do that! I had a poem to say and everything! It mad me so mad yet I was so upset and I still am!  Geez. Well I need to go. Im geting kind of sleepy and it's 11:25pm here. So yeah.  Signing out for now, Bridget.
