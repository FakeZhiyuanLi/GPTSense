      Today is going to be a long entry. Just because I have so much on my mind, and some things that happened in the past few days made me think.  I was going to reply to Toothcake's realtionship post, but as I started typing I realized it was turning out to be very long and personal and... belongs here instead.  I just want to sort this out in my mind once and for all. Parts of this were confided in friends, written in journals or not mentioned at all. I need it to be all in one place in some kind of order.  I was never 100% happy in a relationship. It made sence that they both ended fairly quickly (3 and 2 months).  Even though they were so different from eachother I think at least in my mind they were similar. Both happened at the worst times in my life, when more than anything I needed a friend. These people were just  there  to give me that emotional support. I think in my subconsciousness I knew I was never really in love. I gave it a chance. Unfortunately this is not how I work.  I might be too idealistic, but I can't do anything that disagrees with my inner "I". It will never work out and I need to feel that I am being true to myself even if that might not be what society considers "the norm."  I believe in real love. I don't belive in "giving it a chance" when you know something is not right. I don't mean I want a perfect guy with no flaws. Because then I'd be alone for the rest of my life. :) I just want someone who is perfect for me, meaning I will be so blinded by love I won't even see the flaws. If it doesn't feel like that then I seriously don't think it's worth my time.  Sure, I have times when I just want to be with someone. Everyone does. Loneliness is the human condition. I don't want to end up in a relationship  only   because I am lonely though. Or because I need a shoulder to cry on.  I'm still 16, I don't think I even need to have a relationship right now. I have so much emotional baggage that I should get rid of before that happens. I need to find myself first, before I can share that person with someone else.  When I fall in love I imagine it would be something like this:  This is the first day of my life I swear I was born right in the door way I went out in the rain Suddenly everything changed They're spreading blankets on the beach Yours is the first face that I saw I think I was blind before I met you I don't know where I am I don't know where I've been But I know where I want to go So I thought I'd let you know These things take forever, I especially am slow But I realized how I need you And I wondered if I could come home  I remember the time you drove all night Just to meet me in the morning Yeah I thought it was strange You said everything changed You felt as if you just woke up And you said, "This is the first day of my life." I'm glad I didn't die before I met you Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you And I'd probably be happy So if you want to be with me With these things there's no telling We'll just have to wait and see But I'd rather be working for a pay check Than waiting to win the lottery  Besides, maybe this time it's different I mean, I really think you like me  I'm not advocating love at first sight here. I don't think you can fall in love before you know  anything  about someone, just because you saw them somewhere. I think when it happens both sides feel that attraction, and it doesn't need to be said or made "official" you just KNOW. It come naturally. I strongly believe that you should go through the friendship stage first and get to know the person well enough to see just how much they mean to you. You turn that first spark into something more, but you have to work for it a little.  So... I don't think I have anything else to say about that right now.  This is sort of on another topic but this is an excerpt from White Oleander that is really important to me, especially right now:  " I liked Berlin. The city and I understood each other. I liked that they had left the bombed-out hulk of the Kaiser Wilhelm Church as a monument to loss. Nobody had forgotten anything here. In Berlin, you had to wrestle with the past, you had to build on the ruins, inside them. It wasn't like America, where we scraped the earth clean, thinking we could start again every time. We hadn't learned yet, there was no such thing as an empty canvas."

      I made some goals for myself:  1. Get my G1 (Progress: purchased the Driver's Handbook, number of times looked at handbook: 0)  2. Start doing my Lifeguard training (Progress: none)  3. Get better at playing the guitar (progress: excellent, playing every day)  4. Start going to yoga class again, and the gym (progress: ummm... I got the flyer for when the yoga class times are)  5. Purchase a digital camera (progress: worked 8 shifts in the past 2 weeks, haha.)  6. Start drawing again (progress: can't be made as sketchbook is full, but going to buy another today)  So I will get off my ass and start doing these things. Soon.

      Contrast and compare, between the busy ones and the ones who don't care, until there is no one that you really know. So I drift through these days of appointments and promises made, they will all end up broken and quickly replaced. Weeks are slow, days drag on; even practice and parties seem long, but I found myself going. I guess there's nothing to do. Oh well, group of kids, line of cars, more will show up after the bar's closed. There's this boredom that drowns everything. Bottles break, music plays, conversations competing for space... I look for a corner or a quieter room. There's no heat in this house, I can't breathe with these words in my mouth but I'm not going to say them... Oh yeah, I've made that mistake before. On the stairs, he grabs my arm, says "what's up, where have you been, is something wrong?" I try to just smile, and say everything's fine....

      So: Today  Work was awesome for once. I did counter in the morning and this guy who looked just like Jake Gylenhall came in. I mean JUST like him. I don't even know if I said anything that made sence, but he was really nice and gave me a tip. And smiled at me, so maybe I didn't look like a total idiot. But definatly was awesome...  Then I watched a video on steeped tea. That's right, steeped tea is now available at a Tim Hortons near you. I was drinking it actually as I was watching and it was kinda gross, maybe cause I got milk in it. Also prices went up and people kept yelling at me about it all day because I AM the person who made it this way. Geez. Anyways. I wasted time sitting on my ass for an hour looking at the computer and learning about the tea making process. Which was fascinating by the way.  AFTER this I had "Pastry Training"... tres fun. Meaning I was in the back listening to the radio and decorating strawberry tarts and mixing chocolate custard filling for trifles while everyone else was working. *evil grin* And also sneaking a strawberry slice when the camera was turned around. Yum. :D  Then at 2 some schedule mistake occured and as it turned out EVERYONE left. It was only me and Chantal and Joe. And Joe was in the bathroom most of that time. Enough said. So it was me and Chantal running around trying to get everthing ready for afternoons and serve people and also explain why the hell tea is $1.50 now. They didn't like it. Not at all. Plus the tea tastes kind of suspicious to me... Anyways drank it all and am still alive.  Then got home and took the longest shower known to humanity and washed my hair. IT IS FUCKING AWESOME. Everyone make plans with me soon so you can see it. I'm not kidding. It's all short (well, like the longest pieces are touching my shoulders) and layered, super cool and I   Now I'm home, but I really want to be somewhere where people are so they can admire my hair. Just joking.  I want to save up for a camera. But I'm torn between digital and old fashioned canon type camera. So here's both sides of the story:  Digital Good: I can send pictures to people on msn in very short periods of time. I also don't have to waste money on developing the film. I can have LOTS of pictures and easily put them through photoshop etc...... easy black&white phots. Bad: Can't set the exposure or shutter speed or do anything cool, develop my own pictures, have actual pictures you know on paper. If you purposely mess around with the exposure and such to get some kind of effect the camera "conviently" resets it for you to thr "right" settings. Also no shutter speed option.  Canon Good: Can do all the artsy stuff and special effects. I wont have to borrow the schools for once and share with some loser who wants to take pictures of Willisted for three hours. Develop my own film.  Bad: Takes LOTS of time. Still doesnt solve my problem of not having a regular camera to take to parties, camp and places where people take pictures. LOTS of money wasted on film. Also I CAN use the schools I guess so I won't be totally deprived. And Aaron's taking photography with me so we can share and go cool places....   SO I THINK THE FINAL DECISION  digital camera  Now I need to find a good one that I can afford, wait two for my next cheque, work few extra shifts, and BOOM.  Wow, long rant today........

      I had a girl I knew, she grew, Became a woman now, I think that she teaches at One of the schools downtown, We used to roll the windows down And play the music loud, Smoking out in her car, Lost in west Omaha, And we'd get drunk and kiss, Our bodies twist like shoelaces, And we never came untied, I guess you were just my type, You know that summer never stopped, I still pretend I'm there, The band's in the living room, The neighbours, they never cared, So when I sat behind the drumset, Your heartbeat's what I tried to play, But with the kick and snare so careless, Not in time, So you got ahead of me, And I guess I'm still dragging behind.  I had a friend who changed his name But couldn't change himself, Never quite figured out, How to do with what life had dealt, He put a needle in his arm To calm his handsome hell, Who would've imagined It could've worked out so well? Now he's a shape that moves Like echoes through my empty room, And there's a voice that speaks, Like someone's right behind me, I turned around and found exactly What you would expect, The clothes I left on my floor, The papers piled on my desk, But where the ink is wet, The cause, effects, what's meant by it? The story  is incomplete, The picture's left unfinished, So I am writing my own ending, I let my pen bleed black or blue, And I will colour in the meaning, It will be gold and green and true, And I'll learn to love my new discovered proof, I'll be grateful for this day, I will be grateful for each day to come.   I can't stop listening to this song.

      I went for a walk today. Sat on the stone steps of the portable like me and Ashika used to so long ago...  I just couldn't take it at home anymore. My mother is in one of her depression moods again. Ever since I've been back from camp it's been getting worse every day... She just comes home from work, and goes into her room and cries. I don't know what to do anymore. Today was like the worst day ever, she kept going on and on about my stepdad and how he basically fucked us over so we have no money, everything is fucked up in court, we can't bring my grandmother here from Poland... and how she still didn't get the results from the doctor so she doesn't know if she might have cancer. I mean I don't even know what I would do or where I would go if anything ever happened to her. I have no one else, no other family, just my grandmother in Poland. And I doubt my father would want me. It's like I'm the mother not her, I clean up, I take care of the house, I make sure I don't bother her with anything, work so I don't have to ask for money... but sometimes it's just too much. She's depressed all the time, it's so tiring to always have to try and make her feel ok and so painful since I know I can't change anything....  Sometimes I just wish I wasn't here and then I feel so guilty cause I'm all she has. I felt guilty everytime I called her from camp...  And I mean I'm strong I can deal with this. There are just some days when I want someone to comfort ME for a change... just hold me and hug me and tell me "don't worry". I don't have any friends that would do that. I could come to school with cuts all the way up my fucking arm and no one would care. They're too busy... Honestly who do I have? Suzanne's always busy, she has Joelle living at her house and now Gaby's coming to visit from France. Also she has to be friends with everyone at Walkerville so I don't even spend that much time with her at school. And all the other girls that desperately want to be my friends are so childish, they're fine to go to lunch with or to the movies on the weekend...but that's it.  I don't know....the end.

      I don't have anything to write.  It's just one of those days I wish someone would give me a hug and tell me "everything is going to be ok".  But nobody noticed.  And done.

      Today was my first day back at work. Russell and Bogdan should never be made to work together. It's like they fight over "their territory" or something, and the attention of the girls, which is funny. Having both of them was actually pretty funny, especially when Bogdan started doing his russian immigrant Vladimir accent on the drive-thru and confusing customers... "No cash, no cash, no work, is broken!!!!" :D  Not much else happened except I was super tired and still sick so it made thigs funnier: On drive-thru: Me:"Can I take your order, please?" Guy: " Sesame bagel with cream cheese, please." Me: "Is that for here or to go?" Guy"...........................maybe for here?"  Yesssss :D Then I went to guitar and was easy turns out the song's not that hard after all, only he gave me like 749657 things to do for next week.  And now I'm home. Yay.

      So I watched the movie....  I liked it.  It was a very true portrayal of what happens when you are addicted to drugs. There was no hollywood sugarcoating, or creating a false sense of "beauty" in the pain. It was a hard movie to watch, but I didn't move for one second from the screen, I had this feeling like I can't blink because I don't want to miss anything...  The actors did a very good job, especially Ellen Burstyn who played the mother, Sara. I like the way the movie was shot too, with the cameras in different angles, slow motion scenes etc... The music was also great but very depressing - it went well with the atmosphere of the movie.  The website  urlLink www.requiemforadream.com  reminds me a lot of the Donnie Darko website... very good. Unless you've seen the movie you won't get it though.  After watching this movie there's a lot to think about. I think everyone can relate to it in some way, everyone's had their own experiences with drugs. It definately made me want to stay away from them... I've been under the illusion that doing drugs, will take your mind to another extreme, let you discover more beauty in the world or just maybe numb your emotions. It happens, maybe the first two or three times... then it's more or less a nightmare, the movie tells you the whole graphic truth. I've seen friends walk down that road, and I know I never want to. Besides, it seems like such a cowardly way to deal with your problems, you can't will them away.  Good title too.

      My layout is done. As good as it will get due to my lack of HTML skills. :)   I wasted the past 3 days on the computer. Also I've been sick so nothing got done... oh well. I downloaded A LOT of cds, caught up on forums and e-mails and such. Also had The World's Longest MSN Convo with Frodo also known as the MSN Alnighter. :D  Monday back to work, and I expect people will be bitching at me because apparently they didn't bother to cover me the last 2 days... Hopefully I can do counter so it'll be easy.  Other than that I should probably call some people to make plans. I have been at home for too long. So I will call Suzanne so we can hang out with Gaby who came from France today I think.... Yay, I missed her! Then have to call Megan cause I promised to go stalk the Quiznos guy with her and possibly Ashika so we can go to HMV ..... again.  I realized guitar practice is in one day and I have no idea what song I was supposed to learn... :S  I hope this journal won't be used as my agenda in the future but I needed to put this somewhere until I actually DO it...  Goodnight.....
