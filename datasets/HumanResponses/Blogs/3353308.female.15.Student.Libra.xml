      Yep - still sulking. It's amazing how less than fifteen minutes can ruin your life - and I don't want to hear any of that "It's not the end of the world" stuff - it's pretty darn bad. Not to mention, when I looked in the paper this morning, if I had done my time, I would have come out fifth. The fastest I had to go was 12:06 to make it into the meet, I could have done that time in my sleep last year. I can just hear the others - she just had freshman luck. Good thing my calves kill today. Anyway, reading my comics, waiting for sis to get up so we can go to church.....

      today was awful. I wanted to go back to egg harbor so bad - i had to get top 6. I was ranked 7, which was pretty bad considering that time got me fourth last year. it was hot. Then we began running.. i was doing so good the first mile, it was such a relief, i was going to make it. Then i got into a vacuum - then i got dizzy -then i began not being able to see the lines on the track - then i began really wanting to stop - then i ended up having to slow down to a ridiculous pace - then i got passed by like a bajillion people - for stats, i did my first mile in 5:52 - the second was in 6:36. Nice minute drop off. - anyway, then i collapsed and they had to carry me off - now i've been sulking all day. nice life.

      obsessing over Paul from the movie.... and Ringo - sigh - anyway, I was flipping though YM (yes I read junky girly magazines- i can't help it.... I have a shoe fetish, anyway) and all of the sudden I saw a picture that looked like a guy who had graduated from our swim team a few years ago. Then I looked at the name and it was him - that's not a little wierd or anything. Anyway, this is like my friday b/c I have an art field trip tommorow - thank goodness b/c math today def flew right over my head and i can wait till mon to take the quiz - anyway have to go do stuff

       I  personally find it hilarious that you went on Xanga and concluded that something is wrong with the youth. My conclusion is as follows: what's wrong with you? Way to stereotype - and be really nosy. If you think we're so bored, then what about yourself? Do you have nothing better to do than read journals of people you never have met and then condemn them? You can't judge a person by what they write when they're ranting or what they figure no one will really read anyway. Forget it - I don't know why I'm wasting my time even writing about you. Go get your own life.  Gee,  that was kind of mean of me... Anyway, it was a pretty normal day... Good Luck to Jenifur in her lacross game!! Yeah GL!

      are def not my favorite day of the week. But it wasn't THAT bad, condidering. Sandy is finally home which makes things ten times better  - even if I am really jealous of her not having school. I wish I could stay home and take naps! Anyway, this Flrio guy came to our school - I don't know how he ever became governor. It was like he wasn't human or something. If you asked him a question his mouth just opened and all this garbled stuff came out without any of it meaning anything really. Reason number one I would never be a politician. I mean, why can't there just be normal people up there? Yes yes, I know they wouldn't get elected b/c no one likes to face the truth - but hey, lie to me up front, not behind my back in jumbled words which really don't make sense together

      I feel like I've had to write a billion English essays on on like the same exact thing... It really drives me nuts. Esp. when it's so nice out... It's like the most perfect running day of the year and I can't even go b/c of my dumb shins. Whatever. I went swimming, but that's indoor so it isn't nearly as nice. And now meem has me glued to this chair until I do my essay (yeah, it's the same one as yesterday)I have such bad cabin fever.

       I kinda forgot about this - it's been awful busy... but as holden says "I'd tell you all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like it. I really don't" That prob isn't an exact quote... anyway I'm real excited - we're getting a puppy this weekend!!      It's a little bitter sweet though - I still miss Andy - I feel like I'm ditching him.... he's only been dead since December, and that puppy will never be as cute or as funny or have half the personality of Andy.... but I'll love him all the same. Anyway, I prob shouldn't be writing anyway - I'm in the middle of a Breakfast at Tiffany's final paper for film study - PS I love that movie

      Anyone else notice there is an extreme oversupply of homework? I have to finish by next week b/c I'm not really home the rest of the summer.... I'm going to England + Scotland + Paris for a little over two weeks, then I'm home for a day, then I go to running camp(like I'll still be in shape for that after not running on the trip. great.) and then I'm at Great Gorge for a little and then school starts - I'm excited but I'm more annoyed right now. This history paper is just JUNK.

      kinda funny, all school year you want to just go home and be home and you don't even really care if you never see anyone when you're home because you're finally just home. And i really shouldn't be bored or lonely because I have like a million things to do - and my grandparents are still home and Apollo is home and once in a while i do see my sister.but it's so DULL. I miss everyone. Go cry about it. anyway, going to go do some more work and take over some of Apollo's belly rubs (if you forget he gets a little nippy)
