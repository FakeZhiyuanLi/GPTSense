      It's not easy to describe yourself in a few hundred words. It's even harder to do it in 25, at least judging from the Web personals I'm constantly encouraged to read. Aren't we all sensitive, and funny? Don't we  all  want someone who will share our love of motorcycles, or corgis, or rugby? Haven't we  all  been there before and haven't we all made the same commitment not to play those games, or  not  to let manipulative people take advantage of our good nature?  But this isn't a personal ad, this is my blog. So, it's different, and I'm obviously more interesting and original than the people who post all those personals. Unlike all the other bloggers springing up like mushrooms after a summer rain,  I'm  a keen observer of the human condition.  I've  thought about writing for years.  I'm  married, thirtysomething, live in a nice house in the Connecticut suburbs.  I  do arcane work for a technology services company. See how different? Maybe not so much. Even my name is fairly popular: Googling me turns up a Congressman, a TV producer, a jazzman, a comic book character, a TV doc and many many more  I like to read, and my wife and I belong to a book club. One of the things I hope to put on this blog is my post-book-club reviews of the books we read. I also like movies, and I sometimes see really interesting movies that come to me from Netflix. I like running and hiking and stuff like that (and getting caught in the rain...), and about a year ago I started rowing on a Concept II rowing ergometer. I was an exchange student 20 years ago, and now I go back to France every chance I get.  We're getting there, but does any of that really tell who I am? I grew up in the Unitarian Church, but I've never had particularly strong religious feelings. I'm a Democrat, because there isn't really a further-left alternative that I can take seriously. I think I would be a Social Democrat, or even a Green, if I had the opportunity, but here in the US of A, those parties just seem too silly. I was in the army reserve once, during the first Gulf War, but I never went anywhere or did anything like fighting. Thank the Lord.  I've got a couple of college degrees, and I don't know if I'll ever finish the third one or not.  That's enough of an answer to get started. Maybe if I stick with this, I'll discover more.

      Everybody else has one. All the cool kids are doing it. I triple dog dare you. It's so easy, even my kid has one. He gets like a thousand readers a day.  Where's the outrage? Why don't they cover the things I want to read about? If the campaign only listened to me, I just know they'd win.  Maybe someday I'll write a short story, or even a novel. That's funny, you should write it down. Yeah, in college, some, but not really anymore. See now, that, that, that would be a good movie. Johnny Depp would play Al, and maybe Geena Davis could be Gloria.  I still have to work all day, and I already have too many hobbies, but every single thing I've said so far rings true to me on some level. So, here's my blog. I hope you enjoy it, but mostly I hope I enjoy it.
