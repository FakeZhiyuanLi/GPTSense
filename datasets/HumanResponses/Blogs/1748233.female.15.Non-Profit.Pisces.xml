       I saw a Kerry/Edwards one a week ago. I pointed it out to my mom and we're both like... "Is that guy asking for a death sentence?!"  Kind of sad, really. Democrats don't even have to vote in Texas because it's no use, anyway. Stupid electoral college.

      ...sorry, but right now I have Blogger's commenting system. Not the greatest of things, only because non-users have to post as "Anonymous". Which is a pain.  Both the title and the address are attempts at wordplay. If you can figure it out, that's quite good for you. No prizes though, sorry. Only satisfaction that you're wittier than the average bean... at least when it comes to  my  weird sense of humor.  I have a Blogger profile now, too, which is stupid.

      Yes, I know. I've switched blogs yet again, 10 months and 300+ posts later. It's amazing that I've actually been able to keep it that long. What's even more amazing is that I was able to keep the same template for longer than 2 weeks [which, for those of you who remember my previous experience with blogging, is a feat worthy of the highest praise].  I'm at the library right now. Spending the whole day here, which is too cool for words.  Oh yeah, and I'd like to keep this blog private, all right? Actually, I don't have to worry about that because only 5 or so people read my old blog, anyway. Just a precaution, though =]

      SCREEEEEEW!!!! I WANT TO WATCH THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION TONIGHT!!! KERRY IS SPEAKING AND I WANNA WAAATCH IT!!! BUT NOOOOO, I HAVE TO GO TO STUPID STUPID SAT CLASSES AND I'LL PROBABLY BE LATE AND MISS HALF OF THE SPEECH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok. So maybe I'll be home in time. But gee, can I at least enjoy the last week of break that I have? I finally finished reading the stupid health book [I haven't even signed up for the stupid correspondence course yet, sheesh], and all that crap, and I WANT TO WATCH KERRY'S SPEECH!  Edwards spoke yesterday. He has a Southern drawl, which surprised me at first. Then I realized: Duh, he's from South Carolina [or is it North? Well, he lives in one of the Carolinas and he grew up in the other, so blah].  Why the heck do I care what Kerry says? It's probably going to be painful to watch, anyway. I mean... it's unfair of me to say, but  his face !!!! To borrow from the gossipers of Avonlea and all else Montgomery: How am I to take him seriously when he looks like  that ?  After band camp, I realized several things:    Some people piss me off even when they don't do anything.  I don't know many people very well, and I'm happy with that... sometimes.  People can be very condescending  I am weak.

      Ah, screw.   I hate it when I'm in deep thought and get all these weird and super thoughts... then I forget them before I get a chance to write them down.   That's why I keep a journal. Not a diary, because I write down thought snippets, not "this is what is happening in my life thus far". Although you can probably call it a diary.   [Is the period supposed to be inside the " or outside? According to Lynne Truss the  American  way is to put it on the outside and the  British  way is to put it on the inside, and the American way doesn't make sense, just like everything else American, etc., etc., but  I  put it on the outside and I don't see why putting it on the inside makes sense. I mean, come on.    Let's eat some of the cafeteria's "hotdogs".    versus    Let's eat some of the cafeteria's "hotdogs."   Doesn't the first way make more sense? But maybe I'm biased. I probably am, considering I've been doing it the "American way" all my life. Well, most of my life, the parts I can remember, at any rate.]   I am tired of my Great Search For A Nice-Looking Blog Skin. So I'll make do with this until I get a good one.   THE PRINCESS BRIDE SPECIAL EDITION DVD is only 15 buckaroos. Hm.   I feel very un-special. I want to dance and sing and be good at it. =(   I am going to grow up to be an untalented all-I-can-do-is-study-and-work-and-stress person. Boo.   [Where is Kalamazoo?]

       [I am so so sorry: I have a disclaimer at the end of this. But comforting thought: It's a small one of possibly no consequence]    Something I don't understand:  Why does bad poetry always win? &nbsp;   First&nbsp;of all,&nbsp;let me demonstrate:   The blue sky above me  Swirls around,  Clouds floating, reaching for me as I  Reach  For them, the jejune  silver the fluffy  clouds flying  And I run across the grass and smile   Ok, so I wrote that in about 30 seconds. And only take the first 4 lines into consideration, because somehow the last 4 lines slipped into my own voice. It hurts to write poems that go on as the first few lines did.   What I mean is that the world is full of poetry such as "I love my doggy/ He is smiling at me with his/ Sloppy little grin/ And I smile back at his/ Happy little face". And somehow, for some odd reason, it's that type of poem that, without fail, wins about 90% of all poetry competitions.   I'm sorry, it escapes me: WHY????   In my opinion, that's not poetry. That's prose in disguise. I mean, it's good in its own respect [ie NOT as poetry] and an elementary-schooler would be able to get away with writing that kind of stuff and passing it off as "poetry" [ok, so maybe a middle-schooler can, too]. But why on earth does that kind of poetry win contests?   I don't mean to sound arrogant, but my poems are SO much better than "I eat ice cream dripping off of my fingers/ Making them sticky/ Making them slippery" [Ok, so maybe I do sound arrogant]. Maybe I don't have you convinced. So let's take this a bit deeper...     Things That Make A Terrible Poem [Yini's Analysis]      Common issues&nbsp;in poems  without a sense of purpose      Many exceptions, although the exceptions are usually found in poems written by people who seem to actually know how to write poems      1. The senseless use of line breaks   Line breaks are nice... but not when used just for the sake of using them. For example:     Fishing with my father has always been a  Wonderful thing.   So maybe you want to emphasize that fishing with your father is wonderful. Well, that's wonderful, but what is going on in your head? "I need line breaks! AAHH!! Well, here seems to be a nice place!"    2. Usage of overelaborate words in the wrong places   If you're trying to write a poem with rhythm, huge words tend to screw it up. If you're not trying for rhythm, use words that contribute to voice instead of using big words "because it makes me look knowlegeable". In fact, it does just the opposite.     The river is flowing across the world  Silver water dancing&nbsp;on golden earth  Appearing naive  But in reality fallacious

Apple-cinnamon muffins  that looked like dried, grey tuna... but were actually good! And I made three batches of juice! First it was  WatermelonBlueberryOrangeApple  which looked just like Ebola vomit [I swear. At least, it looked like what I imagine Ebola virus to look like]. It tasted Nasty with a capital "N". Then I made watermelon juice, which tasted good but which Lulu refused to drink. I froze it in hopes of it becoming  WATERMELON POPSICLES !

      Nagging thought... couldn't let go...  So I'm going to share it with all of you before I go on about my weekend! Don't you feel special!  The following passage is from  The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents  by Terry Pratchett. If you want to read the book without any spoilerage, thn don't read the passage and read the bold words [bolded by me]. But the entire passage helps with understanding the bold words, so you should read it.   There's a town where, every time the clock shows a quarter of an hour, the rats come out and strike the bells.  And the people watch, and cheer, and buy the souvenir hand-gnawed mugs and plates and spoons and clocks and other things that have no use whatsoever other than to be bought and taken home. And they go to the Rat Museum, and they eat Rat Burgers (Guaranteed No Rat) and buy Rat Ears tht you can wear and buy the books of Rat poetry in Rat language and say "how odd" when they see the street signs in Rat and marvel at how the whole place seems so clean...  And once a day the town's rat piper, who is rather young, plays his pipes, and the rats dance to the music, usually in a conga line. It's very popular (on special days a little tap-dancing rat organizes vast dancing sectaculars, with hundreds of rats in sequins, and water ballet in the fountains, and elaborate sets).  And there are lectures about the Rat Tax and how the whole system works, and how the rats have a town of their own under the human town, and get free use of the library, and even sometimes send their young rats to school.  And everyone says: How perfect, how well organized, how  amazing !  And then most of them go back to their own towns and set their traps and put down their poisons, because some minds you couldn't change with a hatchet. But a few see the world as a different place.    Whew... that took a while to type.  Anyway... I found that amazing. You know, I really think you could sum up human nature in that one passage.   ~*~*~   Ok, that's all for the profound stuff. Now onto my perfectly lovely weekend.  Saturday, yesterday, was a most lovely day. Woke up at 10:00 [which is unhealthy] and had lunch. And did sundry tasks.  At 1:30-ish I went to watch a movie with Hannah. Yay!  Then I went to Barnes and Noble and, in a fit of spontaneity and indulgence,  bought a copy of The Princess Bride . Sheer wonderfulness! EEEK! [So I'm sitting here, wondering... am I right to be so indulgent? I mean... I still have the book from the library. But I am in love, folks, so that mends everything. The book is the epitome of wonderfulness. An onion.]  My parents then picked me up, and we went to Home Depot to buy some wood. Mom wanted a new shelf for putting CDs on, so there we were, at a home improvement store thing.  Got back home. Parents gave the old bookshelf to me [ A SECOND BOOKSHELF!  Now my other bookshelf can share its books! This way there won't be as many books sprawled all over the ground].  In a couple of hours the new shelf was done [fixed on the wall]. It looked very pretty. We were trying to make it look a little better, and decided to put some decorative stuff we got from China this time [not CDs] on the top shelf. And... it snowballed. We gathered all of the collectibles we got from China and elsewhere and put it on the shelf!  A COLLECTION ! Just like the one my great-uncle has, only not as wonderful. But it  will  be in a couple of years! [Did I ever mention? My great-uncle is my favorite relative. I must brag a bit. He's a college professor and a writer of several dictionaries (yes,  dictionaries ). And he has this most wonderful collection in his house... a really nice shelf built in the wall bearing a really big collection of stuff he and my great-aunt have collected while on business trips and conferences. There is stuff from all over China (or so it seems), the United States, Canada, Germany, France... lots of European countries... Japan, and so many more places. It's amazing. And every time a visitor comes to the house, he gives them a tour of the collection. "Here is a so-and-so from so-and-so"... man. I want a collection like that SO much. And now we've started!  My second-favorite relative is a little sort-of cousin of mine. But i digress. Maybe I'll talk about him some other time.]  So much for a CD shelf. Now all of our CDs are piled up against the wall. Pah, who cares about  them ? Feng shui is more important, yo! [Ok, so "feng shui" and "yo" don't go well together...]  And today was a normal day. Well, as normal it gets.  Wonderfulness.

      Anyway. The Wee Free Men is a boring book so far. The nerve. Terry Pratchett,  boring ? Yes, sadly, it's true. So far, at least. Let's not lose hope.  Obsessive Compulsive = So Very Scary  I watched a tichit of Yu-gi-oh! [What is that ludicrous exclamation point doing there? Stupid cartoon...] today. Like... 10 minutes. Yugi and Kaiba are as stupid as ever. Can you believe it? They spent all ten minutes talking about the value of friendship and how Kaiba keeps losing because he refuses to listen to his "ancient past" and swallow his pride. Literally. ALL TEN FREAKING MINUTES.  For one thing, they give that speech every episode. Second of all, we don't care. At least,  I  don't. I  know  the value of friendship, thank you very much, and I don't need to learn the lesson through watching people play cards. Then again, I'm not seven years old.  How on earth did they manage to base a show off of a playing card game? At least in Pokemon [the show] there are no cards. And, well, Magic has its own series of books. Actually the game is based off of the books. But whatever.  And there's a Harry Potter card game, a Neopets card game, and millions of other card games that  all work the same way . Well, they practically do. [The Neopets game... it's based off of a website. Now  that's  something new...]  Now then. You're probably already saying [thinking, whatever], "Yini, you seem to know a lot about those things. You say they're stupid yet your knowlege proves that you at least pay attention to them. HYPOCRITE!"  Weell... I've read Harry Potter [who hasn't?], I used to play Neopets [for 2 years], I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! [there's the "!" again] for a while [a SMALL while, but a while nevertheless], I used to watch Pokemon in 5th grade, and I know how to play Magic [albeit badly. In fact, I haven't played in a year. Ever since I played Andrew and Chuan and they kicked my arse, even though I had this really nice combination thing that was theoretically indestructible but yet I still managed to screw it up.].  So there we have it. I think it's nicer if HP kept with the books and Neopets stayed with a website. Pokemon is just... weird... and Yu-Gi-Oh! [the show] can't survive without the cards. Magic is fun.

      WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO... I DON'T KNOW, TRADE BODIES/PERSONALITIES/LIVES WITH ME FOR ONE DAY?  I love the world. Then, I hate the world. But I think... that if it weren't for a bit of romance once in a while, life wouldn't be worth it.  Every time I finish a book I get stuck in that book's "mode". Like... after I read The Princess Bride, I felt like making jokes about... stuff. After reading Francesca Lia Block I always feel flowy and poetic. And now I feel depressed after reading Rilla of Ingleside. Not in a bad way, but in a pensive way. And I feel... what's that word? Introspective. Yes.  Introspective .  I have given up trying to figure myself out, and that' because I have reached an epiphany. I'm not going to say any more, because I feel like it. If you really want to know my epiphany [which you probably won't because it's pretty irrelevant now] you can ask me.

       urlLink The Princess Bride    VIZZINI              You fell victim to one of the              classic blunders.

But only slightly              less well known is this: "Never              go in against a Sicilian when              death is on the line."

Of course, it was quite a disappointment to find out that there IS no S. Morgenstern, and that The Princess Bride was written by Goldman, and that the sequel will probably never be written. Oh well... in the face of this situation, the only thing one can do is to quote Westley...   "Get used to disappointment"     urlLink      urlLink Which Princess Bride Character are You?  this quiz was made by  urlLink mysti    Eheh... that's weird.

      I have a disclaimer!  Basically, what it means is that I'm NOT going to put a disclaimer in front of any of my posts. In fact, if anything offends you, you must leave a comment/send me an email to tell me.  I won't be posting anything all that extreme. I won't be posting anything I don't believe, such as "I think men should die because they are a lesser gender". But if I accidently let slip on any of those self-imposed rules, or if you are offended even when I don't, feel free to flame me. All I ask is that you tell me what you have a problem with, and then we can have a nice debate about it.  Capishe?

      My ideology is seriously skewed. To put it in different terms, I'm too ideological and I don't live up to those ideologies.   Idea:  People should stop being so extreme.  Reality:  It can't be helped. When you're attached to something, you tend to edge on extremity.    Idea:  Politicians are bastards who need a good whupping.  Reality:  I'm too interested in politics for my own good.   Idea:  I should be impartial because when one is not hindered by opinions, one can think clearly.  Reality:  I don't know if there's a more opinionated and muddle-brained person than I.   Idea:  If you don't view yourself as equal, you'll never achieve equality  Reality:  Come on, girls: how many of you, in your life, seriously haven't said "Ladies first" just to get a favor?   Idea:  People who are  against  equality of others should be shot. That goes for racists, sexists, and anti-gays.  Reality:  They probably shouldn't be shot. Maybe dangled on a string and fed to the clams. But certainly not shot.

      As you grow older you find yourself more obsessed with appearances, not only beauty but other things as well.  Right now I am thinking about gender differences. I am still unmoved from my opinion that differences between males and the fairer sex [I'm biased =)] are mostly innate. And I don't know which gender is better. I don't think I ever will, and I don't care if there even is any superiority.  I need to break some ice. Turning the temperature a bit higher ought to melt it, if crushing doesn't do.  Apple.  I made a pun joke, although it's in my head and not refined. Although it's rather stupid. Pun jokes are like that. Clever and frivolous.  I am frivolous. To a degree.

      Rather interesting. If you want to read the book click on the title, up there.   The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.   All art is quite useless.

      Third post today =O  I = postaholic. Unfortunately, postahol does not exist [thank you Homer for your lovely malapropisms]  Is seeing enough? What if you can see but you can't shape the vision into something for everyone to understand? How do you teach a blind man to comprehend the depths of color?  I am reading Sylvia Plath's journals.  Anybody who has thought about life and questioned the world will be drawn in to her writing. The journals are like a soul mirror. Mirror magic, fairy dust sprinkling love on dry hungry lips. Reading the journals is like drowning in a looking glass of Plath and merging your thoughts with hers. A biography. It's a biography of everyone, deep down inside.  At times like this, the romance is not enough. Life is unfair. Humans are unfair. And all the unfairness is smothered deep under romance and happily-ever-afters, which are beautiful but shallow.  Nature always seems to find a way to balance everything out.   urlLink The Nightingale and the Rose   Oscar Wilde is beautiful.  At moments like these one must remember to return to the land of the living because when one speaks in strange tones, one is looked at strangely. And more importantly, one is unable to speak in velvetygolden tones anyway, so one just ends up sounding small.  What's the point of stream-of-consciousness when your stream isn't anything to brag about? To smother yourself in morning glory and petulias.

      Yesterday, my mom walked into my room to wake me up. She saw my journal lying indiscreetly by my bed, unwisely left open there by yours truly. Still half-asleep, I saw her pick it up [Later she said she just wanted to see what I was writing every day before bed and had no intention of actually reading it] and immediately panicked. Keep in mind that I wasn't fully awake. I kicked it out of her hands. Yes, kicked. Although [good thing, too], I only managed to kick the journal. Regardless, it tumbled out of her hands onto the ground. My mom gave me a weird look, put it back, and when I made sure she wouldn't pick it up again, I fell back asleep.  I'm rather touchy about people reading that thing. Although the funny thing is, I don't write anything really "private" in it, per se. It's full of observations and feelings instead of "real life" [ie "OMG Joe is SOOOOOOOooo hot but he won't ask me out!!!! And I went to the park to chill with my homies and I had an ice cream that fell and ruined my shirt! >=O"]. I suppose you can call it a piece of soul.  I want to write down everything I feel right now. I'm young. I can still see things that adults take for granted, because they're no longer curious. Life is already routine for them. It's still changing for us, and I want to preserve the freshness of everything. I see the world through a glass shaped by my experiences, you see the world as something shaped by yours. Naivete? I want to remember how it feels, and I am full of it right now. And in the teenage years we're more curious than ever.  Sometimes I want to be a boy. Yesterday I wanted to be a boy, except the feeling was a passing thing that I can't remember fully right now. But boys seem to be less absorbed with shallow problems. They seem to live more interesting lives than  I  do, at least. I can't speak for the entire half of the population.  Of course, maybe I'm percieving things wrongly. Probably am, in fact. After all, it can't be  that  wonderful to be horny 24/7, can it? [kidding, peoples]  The world is my shrimp and I will conquer all!
