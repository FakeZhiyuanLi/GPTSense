      Today was boring I went to the movie 2 days in a row and it gets boring after a while, plus I think I gained 10 pounds off of popcorn! I saw Corey, Justin, and Ryan at the movies so I ditched my parents and hung out with them instead. Then when I was eating lunch my dad had one of his "talks" with me and he said that if I continue to smart off my parents then he will ground me for the rest of the summer (I already have another month to go from the last time I got grounded, so I better watch it!) when I was checking my grades on edline I dropped from a 99% in WV studies to an 87% just because of a stupid test! Its not my fault I failed it! But how could it drop my grade 12 points? O yea and now I have a C in French class because I got a 69% on my finals. Well now I'm just sitting here talking to Lindsey and watching the countdown to degrassi. TTYL bye ~boring post~ I promise it will be better next time *Em*

My ears were bleeding!!! But it was kinda fun and I missed a lot of classes! yay! Then when we were signing yearbooks Chris defazio wrote "glue sniffer" in my yearbook and then my mom read it! Wow...I got a long talk after that! Then my day when down hill from there. At the end of the day I ask Ross 2 sign my yearbook and he threw a melted candy bar at me!!! (I swear someday I'm going to kill that kid!) then I went to the mall with Jaime and I saw Mrs. minney there with her boy friend!!! ahhh he is the ugliest thing I have ever seen!He has like this wired beard and uhhh wow that's all I can say about that! Mrs. minney looked like she was from the ghetto she was all dressed in black. So ya my day was going fine until that  well TTYL bye ~Emmy~

      Hey wow I haven't posted in a long time! Only 7 days of hell left! yay! Today was boring the 6th grade had 60s day and the 7th grade went to valley worlds of fun and the 8th grade...Well we did nothing. The only good thing is that we had no homework and then we had a "food party" in French class. I was supposed to make chocolate mousse and beat David cause we were going 2 c who could make the best but I didn't even make it cause I 4 got 2 get the recipe and then my internet wasn't working so I couldn't look it up. The only reason it wasn't working is because I hit the phoneline with my foot and it wouldn't connect! (duh red moment). So I had to just buy goat cheese (yum yum)I put the cheese in the base room but when I went 2 get it it wasn't there so my and Patrick were walking all over the school trying to find my goat cheese! LOL it was fun then we just watched that stupid movie while we ate. I brought gummi bears to share but in the end me and Patrick decided we didn't want to share them so we secretly ate them during class. After school I went to get pizza with jenny and samantha then we went to the north concert (4 some reason) so we hung out with Angie and I saw Sarah and Natalie their so I talked to them (well I talked 2 Sarah, I think Natalie still had a problem with me cause she is still ignoring me) for like 3 min. And then I ganged up 5th graders to go hunt for Ross and when they found him I chase Ross around the school and drove him nuts (hahaha it was so fun) then I left and went to samantha's make-up party, it was fun toand I got some new make-up. Tomorrow we get yearbooks yay! And we have some kinda dance. ooo that reminds me I have to find what I'm going 2 where tomorrow so ttyl bye

      Hey guys! Yesterday we went to valley worlds of fun, and to be honest that place isn't that fun! Well I rode the go carts with aubby, lindz, Sarah, and patty (driver from hell!) then the guy yells at me cause I didn't get out of the car fast enough for him so that kinda pissed off and then I climbed the wall and rode the bumper car thingys and I was going to ride the water boats but when I was standing in line people soaked me from head to toe so I didn't go on them and then me Sarah and patty ganged up on Natalie and Brittany hall and everyone was laughing at them because  they met these fat ugly guys and they were following them everywhere and u could tell that they didn't want them following them because they kept rolling their eyes and trying to get away so that was funny. Then today we had a little gay assembly and I won this stupid worthless changepures thing but o well I guess its the thought that counts right? Then we had a normal day so it was boring. Then after school jenny and me got bored and she called Patrick and felt that she needed to tell him that I had a huge crush on him and that I loved him (give me a break!) then o course Ross kicked mud all over the back of my legs and I almost killed him (again) then when I got home my dad informed me that I was grounded (once again) and that I couldn't go to sarah's house to watch go gothika tomorrow to I got pissed at him and I was like "I AM GOING AND U CANT STOP ME" and then I just ran away cause I got kind of scared! Well that's about it TTYL bye
