      Yes, A-Grade!  There was an open race at Gunnedah on the weekend so the field was depleted. A and B grade started together but we took off and left them behind pretty quickly. Actually, when i say we, i mean the rest of A-grade took off and i held on. There were only 5 of us and that meant there was nowhere to hide. We were going flat out and I started taking turns, albeit short ones. Rain and wind prevailed throughout the entire race.  There were 2 guys in the bunch that were heaps stronger than the rest and occasionally (or was it frequently?) one of them would take off and get a gap on us. Then it was even harder. Same workload and 1 less person to do it. It seemed like we spent the entire race chasing someone.  At the end of the first lap (25km) i was just happy that I was still with them. Second lap was harder. One of the strong guys got away and the other strong guy stopped taking turns. That was really ticking me off. We eventually caught the breakaway with about 4km to go. We went over Blood Hill and he took off again. With 2km to go one of the other guys dropped off the back and so three of us tried to chase.   This time I was skipping turns. I was shattered but wanted to make sure I was with them at the end. At some point we realised that we weren't going to catch the break, probably about 500m out and we began sizing each other up. Still I just wanted to make sure I didn't get dropped, even this close to the line. The sprint started but I kinda got blocked or at least I nearly ran up the back of one of the other two, braked a little and never really got up to speed again. I suppose the near miss caused me to panic. If I had just swung around him instead maybe I would have been able to get past. There was a bike length in it and I was utterly spent!  I can only hope that with a bigger bunch I will be able to hide a little more often! Average speed was 38kph over the 50km. Not comparable to tdf stats but a big jump up for me. It's a pity really that I will only get 2 more scratch races up there this season. Hopefully next year I can make it back into A-grade earlier in the season and have a few starts with our clubs' european star, Phil Thaux (http://www.cyclingnews.com/teamcn.php?id=teams/cyclingnews/2004/diaries /phil06). I should point out that one of the guys in A Grade made the comment that he was the "first 54 y.o. across the line". Taking up competitive cycling at 30 wasn't too late afterall.
