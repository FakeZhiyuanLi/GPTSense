      What a shitty day. Rainy and 50 degrees out. This sucks. O'well, I'm at work and it's nice and comfortable inside. Oooh, and we got our quarterly bonus too, so I will have some spare pocket change come weekend. GooSH!™

      My first day on the Blog Report. Raining out the arse today but other than that, the day has started off fairly well. We'll see how it goes.

      Lots of my friends losing their jobs today. A serious bummer indeed. All is seemingly quiet here. We'll see what happens....

      Ok, so cool groups of the week are:  A Perfect Circle  Maroon 5 (Harder to Breath is spankdilyicious!)  On a lighter note. I ended up getting too drink to drive at Jim's party this past memorial day weekend. Of course my car was in the driveway with the sunroof open. And it rained. My interior was completely friggin' SOAKED! Needless to say I was pissed, but whaddya gonna do? I think I got it all dried up. And the next owner will never know, so no worries! :)

      Ok, so it's June 3rd and the company is doing MASSIVE layoffs tomorrow. 7,500 peeps or so. I got my fingers crossed. Yikes, we'll see what happens. On a sad note, Shawn's dog Bear passed away today. He was a cute little guy. Life sucks sometimes. Maybe it won't tomorrow. Then again....

      Ok. Made it through the cuts and still kicking at work. My daughter Haley is here to spend the summer and we are really enjoying the time together. She's in daycamp at the YMCA and having fun. We saw the new Harry Potter movie today and it was pretty good. For now, it's bedtime....
