        Lord, my heart has found a home....Today was a pretty awesome day. It all started around 9 this morning, TC (my boyfriend) brought me breakfast in bed. It was a ham biscuit from john boys... It was good!! Then we went to Lowes -Where TC now works.. i'm Super Proud! We bought some wood for his entertainment center that we had planned out for his new tv we bought the other night at best buy. We got to his house and started to work. By 3 we were finished building it.. it ended up being around 63 in tall....so its gonna be a pretty big deal for his room. We are not finished with it completely though. I started to sand some...so we can stain it eventually and make it look pretty! I reckon Tmw we will be doing that. I'm excited because we built something together..we make a good team:-) The sweet part is.. he is going to put our initials on it somewhere so we can always remember building it! Ohh and he's make a special shelf for our picture frame! Oh I love him! Well he had to be in at work at 4:30...today is his first day!! I came home and took a long nap! I didn't get to go work out with mom at curves today because i was so sleepy..Oh and by the way.. girls -Curves is awesome...check it out!! Well i woke up and ate and then took a shower...and shaved..hehe! I figured i wouldn't have anything else to do...so Mom Dad & I watched win a date with Tad Hamilton...which by the way is the sweetest movie in the world. When that was over..tears were just a rollin' lemme tell yah! But yeah... I usually don't get emotional over stuff like that.. but idk whats gotten into me lately... its a good thing though- I like it! It must have something to do with Mr. TC...haha!! It's about 10:15 now.. so TC should either be calling soon...or coming by for a goodnight kiss.. i know I know.. how sick.. But really its sweet..:-) He's sweet *&amp;* So perfect! Goodnight everyone.. Sleep well &amp; i'll try to write as soon as i get a chance...Love Yah!!!!
