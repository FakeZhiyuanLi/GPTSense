      Took Mischa & Simba to the vet this morning (they hadn't gone in sooo long so I figured they prolly should). Of course, Simba did NOT want in that carrier & Mischa loved it. *sigh* Neither one of them were overly good for the vet but no one got bitten, so I guess that's a plus. They're all shotted up, poked & prodded & after having had a nice full meal, they're both sleeping somewhere. Hopefully D&B will leave them alone today. Mischa needs his teeth cleaned so that'll be $230, thank you very much. Hold on, Dr. Lewis...let me pull that out of my ass, where my personal ATM is located & rip off some $$ to brush the fucking cat's teeth. Grr. I guess I'll have to budget for this one, too...poor kitty needs 'em done.   Still no poop from B. Today makes 8 days. J has him back on the Miralax every day now but we're thinking it's Fleet time. I don't wanna be in on that one. I guess I'm overreacting to the fact that this 8 y/o boy hasn't taken a fucking dump in 8 days. Call me crazy - I think that's abnormal. Come to find out that when D was a little kid (about B's age) she was in the hospital for the same thing & had to be disimpacted. That alone tells me that this is an ongoing problem, and that a fucking kid not going for 8 days is a sign of a problem. Something also tells me that B was never really regular when he was on the meds, either. I don't think he's ever been really cleaned out - it's just allowing the newly digested food to be passed but the that the initial blockage is still there. Then again, wtf do I know? I don't have kids......  Which brings me to me point about tension.....last night in the car on the way home from DQ, me, J & my sis, M,  were talking about kids in general. I made mention of the fact that screaming in public & other public displays like that to me are unacceptable behavior. They shouldn't happen. Period. When they do you have to address the problem. Father of the Year made the rather enlightening remark "Well, you know, when you have kids that all changes." No fucking kidding. Duh. I wasn't aware of that. I was merely giving my opinion as to what I thought was acceptable behavior & what wasn't. M had even made the comment that if her kids had acted like that in public she would react to it. I then made the remark that her kids wouldn't act like that in public because she would raise them NOT to. And, on the rare occasion that they did, it would be dealt with right away. And there, again was the remark "Kids change everything." I got my panties in a twist over it. It pissed me off. The rest of the evening was tense - he & I didnt say 2 words to each other all night & J decided he'd sleep down here all fucking night. I came home from the vet & he's upstairs, sleeping I suppose. I could care less. I'm pissed off, so is he & the kids being here don't help, either.   OK, I'm done whining for now. Whew...I think I feel better. Nope, wait, I don't. I'm still fucking pissed. I think I'll give in to it & get some McDonald's for lunch...... then again, I'd better not. The last thing I need is McD's. **sigh** but a Big Mac would taste sooooo good right about now......

      So here we are, day 1 on the blog but now day 5 since B's taken a poop. Amazing that I've now taken to counting the days by dumps taken rather than by merely ticking the days off on the calendar. The fact that an 8 y/o can keep that much shit inside is incredible. If I go a day a day without going I feel shitty....literally. (Yeah, yeah....I suck at adjectives). Tomorrow is Day 6 -if no poop by tomorrow it's Fleet time. Not in my yob deescreepshun, man. That one falls to J...I ain't doin' it. I draw the line at soaking shitty underpants in OxyStain (which is the world's greatest spot treatment for poop, lemme tell ya'. They call it "organic material" on the bottle but what they really mean to say is shit. Works great). Anyway, back to the encopresis issue. Poor kid I feel sorry for but I know exactly how this whole problem started. If we had stuck to the schedule of tapering off the Miralax like the doc said instead of just doing away with it altogether we'd be looking at a regular 8 y/o instead of a kid with intestines like a 90 y/o in the nursing home. **Sigh** I hate enco....so does everyone else but I   REALLY    hate it. The smell of poop & OxyStain is beginning to get to me, ya' know?  On a lighter note, back to work today after 2 days down w/tonisilitis. Yeah, I know my life is boring if all I have to talk about in my newly installed blog is shit & tonsilitis. Gimme a break...I'm fucking new @ this blog stuff. I have nothing else to talk about ....yet. For now it's gotta be tonsilitis & shit. So back to my throat. It's better but talking all day wore me out. Home to eat, get a shower & lay down, which I think was a mistake since not only am I congested but now I'm stuck with insomnia. I was wiped out when I woke up & walked J outside to work but now after taking some pills, doing some dishes & dealing with 2 kids who didn't want to take showers (they lost...I won) I'm now wide awake & congested. At least I'm breathing...guess that's more than Reagan can say (yeah, I know...potshot at the dead guy. Again, I take refuge in the "I'm new here" defense).
