      I promised I wasn't going to write about things that happened in my everyday life, but I feel that if I write about something that happened tonight, then it will tie in and work wonderfully for a message.  I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror and fixing my hair when I heard my grandfather yell from the other room, "That internet better be off by 12 or I'm gonna rip it out of the wall! All you ever do is stay on that computer! You never clean or do anything around here!"  Those of you that have kept up with my away messages and such and know how much of an insomniac I am know that many nights I cannot sleep. Most times I do find productive things to do such as clean the entire house and make breakfast for my grandparents.. so I really don't know why he said that because I also visit my friends a lot. It has only been just recently that I've been on a lot. Well, to continue, those of you who know me on a more personal level know that I am not one to take things lying down, so to speak. I will stand up for myself and what I believe... I don't care who you are. My grandfather is not the most open-minded person and he is quite domineering (perhaps that's where I get it from) but I did defend myself. Still in the bathroom, I yelled to him, "Well you don't clean up or anything and you don't have the internet so what's your excuse?" I heard his footsteps pound down the hallway to the bathroom door. He stormed in and I moved back from him as he kept coming towards me. He raised his hand as to hit me, and did. I've been hit worse.. it was no big thing. That is when I felt tears come to my eyes and I began crying, all the time still defending myself. That is when he said it. "If you ever talk to me like that again, I'll kill you." I stood and looked him in the eye. "Go ahead. Go ahead and kill me. I only clean your house and fix you breakfast but I'm still not good for anything." The 'conversation' proceeded as such and finally he left and I just sat there in the bathroom and cried, remembering what he had said..."I'll kill you" echoed in my thoughts. I buried my face in my hands and sat there in the dark. I thought to myself if I ever had kids, even if I were to get extremely upset with them, I would  never  tell them that I would kill them. Come to think of it, I would never tell anyone I truly loved anything of the sort. So it made me think; he must not really love me. I can feel tears in my eyes even as I write this because I still remember it so vividly. But... why would I want someone like that to love me... someone who would "kill me"? I don't. I can predict that tomorrow he will try to apologize to me saying "Oh well, I don't mean to be so gruff.. I'm always that way" or "I was mad and I don't really mean it."  I have always made it a point to forgive everyone, because Jesus forgave mankind, but I can honestly say it will take me some time before I will forgive him. Even if it was just out of anger, that isn't something I would say to my mother or future spouse even if they had just betrayed me. I don't know where I'm trying to go with this... but if you would, offer me some advise. I'm starting to think he just doesn't love me because .. well I've explained it enough. I just feel so hurt and confused. He's been like this all my life. He'd always get mad, hit me, then apologize for it. I'm not saying I didn't deserve it, then or tonight, but the fact he told he'd kill me if I talked like that again sent an arrow piercing through my heart. I've never been more sincere about anything I've ever written. Mark my word, as soon as I graduate high school, it's off to college and I'm never coming home... never coming back here. I'm just too strong willed for my own good I guess... and two personalities like his and mine do not need to mix very often, if ever. *tear*

      I mentioned I would focus on some positive aspects of life. God. God gave us life, created the universe. Life is an immeasurable gift that has yet to be priced. Since the first time He gave breath to man, men have continued to try to live life to the best of their means. Life maynot always come at everyone in the same way, or with the same force. But just think; atleast you have a life that can be screwed up, compared to those who have lost their lives.   A Wise Word: Never take life for granted. Praise His name.

      In response to the comment Troy left regarding my previous post, I would like to say that I only applied Theology to Time and not Love for a reason. Yes, it is my firm belief that God is the governing force of the entire universe. However, not all feel the same way as me. I did, in fact, still want to present love as a universal concept to those of different religions etc. I did not do this with time, though, because it is not as important as love and also interpretted many ways. I'm not saying that Christianity takes a back seat. I'm simply saying that in hopes of appealing to everyone, I tried to go meerly by reason instead of rhyme, so to speak.

      There are many great aspects to life. However, life can be compared to a whore/tease; Life gives you just enough to taunt you and make you want more. It tempts you to do wrong and tries to pull you down onto the filthy street. But don't forget, there are the positive parts to life. I'll hit on those next time.

      I've given up on my past concept of "journals" and "blogs." In past posts, most were geared to the goal of telling about my life and what not. Now, however, I think I have moved past that. My goal is to post blogs more along the lines of thoughts and writings.  Lately, the concepts of Love and Time have been pressing on my mind.  Love. I tried to define it once, but I wasn't very successful. But unlike other things that are not tangible (such as fear, hate, etc.) can be described, love is greatly different. I tried to describe it as follows:   To start, I will discuss my new stance on love. As Dray has pointed out, and quite so, romance and/or romantic love is not possible in high school. It really sickens me to see the "L" word used over and over in people's profiles when it is meerly obsession or infatuation for a short time period. I can bet that 99.9999% of them will not be together for a year or two and will most assuredly never marry. Yes, have fun in high school, but please, do not jade everyone to love. Love is not plastering their name and ":-*" all over your profile. If you truly love someone, show it in actions, not words.    And then I went on to try to define the actual sensation of love with a few examples.   Again people, how many times must I make you aware, if you keep using the word "love" it will no longer mean anything. You don't seem to get it. Especially most of you now that are just in high school. You honestly can't tell me that you really think you found your future husband or wife... and if you do, I won't believe you... because things like that just don't happen. I will try to define "Love". Love means an unconditional caring, self sacrifice (like willingness to die for the other person). Love is seeing yourself eighty years old and waking up beside the same personyour entire life and loving every inch of them as strongly as they day you were married. It's getting held up in a bank, gun to your head, knowing your last moment is near, but not being scared because he told you he loves the way you are always fearless or because she said you have always been her hero. It's the feeling like you could climb to the peak of the highest mountain and sing forever of how you feel, yet all the singing in the world could not even make a dent on how you truly feel deep down... because no one has ever created a word that expresses it. Love is realizing that if you had never met him/her, you're life would be drastically different and that you would have been missing out on so many wondrous things... it makes you feel incredibly lucky that you found them... like the luckiest person in the world. Love can never truly be defined, but I tried, and now hopefully you all can see why I really hate the misuse of the word. Those of you that perhaps have only been dating a week or a month have no earthly way of knowing it's love. They are all merely infatuations.... but don't get me wrong. It's good to date casually and find what types of people and personalities mesh well with yours, and it's good to gain friends whom really trust and care for you. To those of you that realize the importance of the word, thank you for not abusing it. As with this though, there are those few exceptions to the rule. In all you do, be wise.   It was also mainly bashing those that use the word "Love" like a pack of ketchup; all the time and lots of it... even when you don't need it. I would like to state, however, that that is just the way I view it. There is not right or wrong in love (or war). Everyone is open to his or her own opinion, and even opinions about other people's opinions, but please, do remain civil. I would like to think that we are not all heathens and renegades, with atleast a few years of grammar and english. And as I have stated before, patience is a great virtue. But also is acceptance.    Time. Sometimes I think time is just a concept devised by us humans to limit ourselves. But then other times I realize that even God himself used time. He created the world in 7 days. Most of us say to ourselves, "AH I need more time," or "Time is running out." But yet, on a grander scale, it's our own personal want. God gives us as much time as we need to do with our lives what he wants us to do.. and sometimes a bit less. Afterall, we have to become more efficient, we have to prime our bodies, for they are not ours but His. We are His children and His temple. We have everything we need, all the time we need, because He is the giver of gifts unworldly and extremly precious. Therefore, be glad for the time you have.    Until my next post, .Melody.
