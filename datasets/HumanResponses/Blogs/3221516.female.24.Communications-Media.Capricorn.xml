      This is my first post on my new blog - Hooray! The last blog I did was kind of silly, full of pictures and stories from my childhood. This one will feature more of my own thoughts and ramblings. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed blogging until I wandered away from it for a while. But now I'm ready to attack it with a new vengeance.

      I had my first of two cavity-filling visits yesterday, but of course, it's in the stars that normal dental visits are not meant to happen to me. One of my already-filled teeth turned out to have decay underneath the filling, so that by the time both the filling and decay were removed, I was left with a shell-like tooth, with practically nothing inside. I now have two options: root canal and crown or extraction, tooth implant, and crown. Do you think I broke down in the doctor's office? You betcha!  Since my wisdom teeth are scheduled to come out in a few weeks anyway, and since there's not much left of this tooth to save, I'm leaning towards option B. He's already going to remove four teeth from my mouth. At this point, what's one more?  I am the worst dental patient ever. If only I had kept up on my six-month visits like a good girl, none of my current troubles (except for the wisdom-teeth pulling; that just has to happen) would have taken place. And I have no excuses. I've always been covered under a good insurance plan.  When I have children, it will be my mission in life to make sure they understand the value of having good teeth. Not saying that my parents  didn't  do that; I was just a stupid, stupid girl.  After my ordeal with the dentist, I went to return an overdue new release at Blockbuster. As soon as I handed it over, the clerk removed the "New Release" sign, allowing the "One Week Rental" banner to show. "This movie just became a one-week rental?" I asked. She nodded.  Of course it did.

      Kind of. My screenwriting professor asked me if she could include my documentary treatment in her upcoming book! How cool is that?!  For the same class, I watched  Bowling for Columbine  last night. Really great film. Powerful message. I highly recommend it.  I wish I had more, but I don't.

      It's been a busy few days. On Wednesday I visited the nail salon again and had my fake nails shaped into less of a square shape and more of a rounded one. I like them a lot more now, so it looks like they're here to stay. I look at them a lot, and I'm surprised just how much I do like them. This kind of thing is not something I've ever been into before, but it's so nice to have my hands look nice on a daily basis and not have to do a thing. It also keeps me from chewing on my fingers - definitely a plus.  In Screenwriting, we've moved away from the dramatic script in order to focus on the documentary. We shared our treatments (proposals) with our group members on Thursday, and everyone (professor included - she sat in on my session) seemed to really like my idea, which is to follow the trials and tribulations of my sister, Samantha, as she works toward earning her teaching license.   I really love this class and the work we've been doing, in a way that's much different than my love for fiction. It's nice to be learning a new kind of writing, to get a fresh perspective on what you can do with words and how you can use them to affect others. I'm viewing movies in a brand-new way, even finding myself attracted to films that wouldn't have sparked my interest two months ago. Maybe this summer I'll buy a video camera and bring these scripts to life.   And finally, today: my sister, Ryan, graduated from high school. My family pulled double duty with the Mass and commencement ceremony taking place one right after the other. We were all very proud of her.

      Yesterday, I was interviewed for an article about literacy programs in the city of Chicago for a magazine called  The Reader . A woman in my fiction class was contacted by the reporter and she suggested that I give him a call as well. It was fun - he asked me about my reasons for choosing DePaul, what I thought of the program, my goals after graduation, etc. The issue will hit newsstands on June 4th.   Because I work in PR, I'm usually the one asking the questions, so this was a nice change of pace. The interview also got me thinking more about what I want to do once my time at DePaul is over. I assumed that I would just start looking for a different job closer to Chicago, but I also know that I want to earn an MFA in Creative Writing. Would it be wrong of me to enroll in another graduate program before paying off loans for my first two degrees?  I love school. I love learning new things. And I love being around people with whom I share this one common interest: we have something to say.

      Another great Sunday, another great hour spent at Barnes and Noble. Today I bought a large-print edition of  The Fountainhead  (one of the greatest books ever written),  The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath ,  1984 ,  Animal Farm  (both books I've read and deeply love), and a memoir by one of the actresses from  Days of Our Lives . Once the spring quarter is over (three more weeks - woo hoo!), then I can get busy on my summer reading list. I'm currently in the middle of  The Neverending Story , which is very good and much more involved than the movie, and I bought Haven Kimmel's first fiction novel a while back. I'd also like to dig into  The Chronicles of Narnia  series, and then, of course, there's my blog book. Busy, busy, busy.  One book that  almost  made it into my pile was  The Orchid Thief  by Susan Orlean, the inspiration of the film  Adaptation . I had to watch that for my screenwriting class and thought it was great. It also inspired a newfound interest with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. Luke and I watched  Being John Malkovich  on Friday night and saw  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  about a month ago at the show - some really great stuff. Has Kaufman done anything else?  In other news: I received an A- on the rough draft of my screenplay. My professor thinks it's very strong but that the plot is a little overwhelming; she suggested editing out the mother-in-law's murder. But Lifetime will never buy it then!   Decisions, decisions....

      Thursdays are the days that I spend in class at DePaul University in Chicago. By next June, I will have my very own Master of Arts in Writing.  In my Writing For Fiction class, there are several undergraduate students that didn't form a large enough group to create their own class, so they've been mixed into the graduate section - something I'm not thrilled with. I've only been out of undergrad for two years, but being with these students makes it feel like decades ago.  First, I'm amazed at the language they use in class. It's "F*** this" and "F*** that," with the professor right there. I'm not a prude or anything, but there's a time and place for that talk, and the classroom is not it. Secondly, they're constantly not completing assignments and constantly giving BS excuses - "I had a big test to study for and I didn't have time." "I didn't have the assignment written down so I didn't know what we were supposed to do." Never mind the fact that the assignment load isn't that heavy in the first place and that it is NOT acceptable to pick and choose the work you feel like completing for a particular week. Never mind that our professor created a sheet filled with students' names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses JUST SO that we can contact other classmates if need be, AND that these undergrads are all friends and could've gotten any one of the assignments with little effort. And these excuses aren't just presented to the teacher during the designated break - for some reason, these students feel the need to share their cockamamee stories with the entire class. They constantly interrupt the professor when she's talking with inappropriate outbursts, and one student even said that she had probably read more on a particular subject and was therefore probably more knowledgable. The gall of these people!  As much as I enjoy Writing For Fiction, I'll be very glad when it's over.

      I visited my dentist today for a teeth cleaning and found out I have four cavities. Four! I also made an appointment to have my wisdom teeth pulled out next month. Joyous.  My love affair with the dentist began about two months ago, after my first visit in three years. Today was the first visit I didn't leave crying - but then again, it  was  just a cleaning. In February, I found out that my wisdom teeth had to go and a crown was needed on a tooth I had cracked. I bawled on and off all day. The day I received my temporary crown - definite eye leakage. The day my permanent crown arrived: "This will be a piece of cake," the doctor said. "You don't get numb, there's no pain - you're in and you're out." Not only did I have to be numbed, I had to use the special laughing gas mask in order to keep from jumping every time his finger was in the vicinity of my mouth. Tears followed.  For my first (and hopefully last) teeth-pulling experience, I've decided not to go under and instead pray that numbing and laughing gas will be enough to get me through. A co-worker joked that they would get me drunk the night before my extraction. With my track record, it's not a bad idea.

      Well, what do you know - this blogging thing is really catching on! My boyfriend Luke and his good friend Tom started blogs this weekend (see links on the right; Tom's is actually a concept blog).   I purchased a book last weekend called  Never Threaten to Eat Your Co-Workers: Best of Blogs , and it is said that blogging (also referred to by this book as "little-j journalism") will take over the print medium and reshape literature as we know it. I feel like I'm part of this neat club that only the truly creative types care enough about to join.  Bloggers of the world, unite!

      Aesthetically, this has been a big year for me. I'm feeling more comfortable in my own skin, allowing myself to wear clothes with a tighter, more revealing nature, and "tainting" my hair color with fun summer highlights that I love enough to keep permanently. My newest venture - fake nails.  Huh.  Let me first say that these nails are beautiful - a French manicure, no less. I've never had a French anything before. (Well, I guess that's not entirely true.) And wearing them makes me feel a little more grown up, a little more sophisticated, even a little more womanly. It's like my normally ugly, chewed up fingers are wearing a Halloween costume that can safely stay put for three to six months.  That being said, they're also a major pain in the ass.  The first day was the worst. I couldn't turn the key in my car's ignition without my nails clinking against the steering wheel, and I almost broke one just by opening my car door. Handling towels and wash clothes are now brand new experiences, and I must take extra care when removing clothes from the washer and dryer. I had to get a brand new wallet because I can no longer thumb through my plastic cards. Picking at my wedgies are a thing of the past. Hell, I can't even get my fingers through my hair in the shower without fear of the nails breaking off and getting lost. How has this phenonmenon caught on to so many women?  Upside - I haven't chewed my fingernails since Tuesday because - well - it's simply no longer possible.  I have an image of this wonderfully sophisticated woman I want to be one day, and I thought that these nails would bring me one step closer to that woman. Now I'm realizing that maybe she's not as cool as I once thought. I think I'd rather be able to pick my wedgies.  Other news: I have fallen in love with my screenwriting class and the art of writing for film. I recently turned in an 18-paged dramatic story filled with lust, betrayal, vomit, and murder. In it, a married woman feels trapped as the caregiver of her 82-year-old-dying-of-lung-cancer mother-in-law, has an affair with the neighborhood handyman, and kills the old woman with a pillow. Not a masterpiece, but definitely worthy of a Lifetime movie. Maybe one day I'll post it....  Today is also my two-year anniversary as an employee for Saint Joseph's College. I'm not sure whether to feel really proud or a little bit sad. It's probably both.

      Whether I'm rolling in the dough or counting out quarters from the change compartment in my car, I've realized that these food items remain constants in my kitchen cabinet. When I'm at the store, I automatically pick up a box of noodles and two to three jars of Prego sauce. Then when I'm back at home and putting groceries away, I find that there are still three jars of Prego sauce and at least two boxes of spaghetti still sitting on the shelf, with one of the boxes only half-used. But it doesn't end with Betty Crocker pouches and carbohydrates drenched in sauce - there's yogurt, applesauce, pudding, grapes, cereal, and a freezer filled with pre-made pizzas and Healthy Choice dinners. In a nutshell, my at-home menus consist of really fun side items (at least, the kind I was in love with as a kid) and main courses that are microwave friendly and have little desserts right next to the salisbury steak. The last time I had pot roast was probably at Saint Joe's cafeteria last year. Ribs? Smoky Bones. I can barely motivate myself to open a can of soup because I'm too busy thinking about the dirty pot I'll have to wash afterwards. The only thing I ever make "from scratch" is spinach dip (does that even count?), and even that never turns out quite how I'd like it to (just like Applebee's!). It's really very sad.  I assume that this attitude of mine will change once I'm in a kitchen with glorious counterspace and the world's finest ingredients at my disposal. I'll be eager to devour the secrets hiding out in my Philsbury cookbook and embrace a recipe that takes longer than 15 minutes to prepare. Right now, though, I'll continue to eat spaghetti at least once a week, munch on Fruit Smileys every single day (the fifth grader in me just adores them), and consider pre-cooked chicken nuggets a gourmet treat.   It's a good thing Luke can cook.

      No, not really, but he is pretty great. I had my post-opp (post-operation) check-up yesterday, and he gave me a friendly pat on the shoulder and a smile before asking how things have been since my extraction. I have never had a dentist I've felt so comfortable with. If I'd had care this good in Chicago, maybe I wouldn't have taken a three-year break from professional oral hygiene. Anyway, my stitches are out and I'm healing nicely. Next step: my crown from March is still pretty sensitive to hot and cold, which isn't a great sign, so I need to schedule an appointment up north with some kind of -ontologist to see if the nerves need to be killed; then I can stop wincing every time milk hits the left side of my mouth. More dentist adventures for me - woo friggin' hoo.  For the last couple of nights, I've been plagued by dreams that seem pretty damn real while I'm in them. Thursday night, in a dream inspired by watching an episode of VH-1's  Driven , Ashton Kutcher called me at home (which happened to be Chicago with my family), and we had a marathon phone conversation that ended with us making plans to get together. (Evidently I have much more sex appeal than Demi.) Last night, I was in my high school auditorium (which, of course, really wasn't my high school auditorium), complete in my old Catholic-school-girl attire, which fit surprisingly well. We were all gathered to hear the news that an old school friend had died (who I don't even think actually existed), and I was crying hysterically. Then suddenly I'm walking down Archer Avenue (still in Chicago) and bump into another friend from Maria High School, still crying. She and her father gave me a ride home, but I think it was in a shopping cart, and then suddenly we were by Lindy's Chili, right across the street from McKinley Park. Then I woke up.  I'm not sure what these dreams mean, but I am sure that I miss Chicago. I miss reading on the train ride to work and getting to the mall in 15 minutes. More importantly, I miss my family. I miss seeing them every day. I miss joking around with my dad and hashing out gossip with my mom before going to bed. I wish I could attend Donna Lyn's assemblies and help Ryan with her college registration without having to take a vacation day. And I miss my friends.  Oh, well. There are certainly many good things about Rensselaer, things that I plan on discussing in a piece for my writers' group meeting this Thursday. But I think I've almost had my fill. Almost.

      "Involved For Life" is Saint Joe's newest tagline, but with the way things are going, I'm not sure how much longer I myself will want to be involved. The president is driving me crazy with his constant criticism of our Web site - I think he believes that if we throw a few extra pictures up there, we'll be able to make up for all of the students our admissions office has failed to bring in. Almost every day I'm given a new "top priority," and with each assignment I've been told to ask myself, "Does it bring in students?" Pretty soon, he'll have to start asking himself, "Are my actions turning away employees?"  OK, enough griping. In more pleasant news, I've rediscovered that famous girl detective Nancy Drew. I'm in the middle of reading the first release of the original hardback series,  The Secret Of The Old Clock , and I didn't remember how dated these ones actually were. With the first copyright issued in the 1930's, it's no wonder that Nancy wears gloves, carries a pocketbook, uses a vocabulary that includes "shan't," and solves all her cases in pants suits and dresses. She also seems to rescue every person she comes into contact with, and her departure is always sorely missed. In the revised series issued in the 80's and 90's, she is revamped to fit into that time period, discovering jeans and colloquial language. She's also allowed to have a boyfriend. There was a recent article that announced yet another Nancy Drew unveiling. I wonder what they've done to her this time.

      Remember my happy post from Saturday night? Well, today it's Monday, and let me tell you, when you don't have pain killers flowing through your system, it's a very different experience. I feel totally worn out and it's not even 11:00 a.m. yet. I had visions of doing laundry after work, but I'll most likely just load up on drugs again and pass out on the couch.

      Well, folks, it's done. Yesterday morning I lost five of my teeth, and I must say, it really wasn't bad at all.   When I got there, the nice dental assistant gave me some pills for nausea, nerves, and pain. Minutes later, I was in the The Room, where they led me to The Chair and gave me The Mask. My favorite part about the dentist is The Mask, as it allows me to feel comfortable enough to play with my lips and laugh out loud without embarassment or shame. This time, I made it a point to inform my dentist that I had flossed for the big day.   "Thank you!" he said.   What a wonderful man.   It wasn't until the gas was fully in my system that the needles came out and the numbing began. That was actually the worst part, because I could feel the needle going deeper into my skin/gum (hell, I can't remember where) with each shot. Once I was all numbed up, the pushing began. I say pushing because that's what it felt like - like a little group of midget men were heaving and hoing into the side of each tooth. And then... "The first one's out!" he said, and I asked to see it. It was a big tooth. I was impressed.   He kept going, and after about an hour, all five teeth were out. I remember holding ice packs and feeling very shaky. Luke said they were a little worried about me because my face was white and my lips were purple. I slept a lot for the rest of the day, but there wasn't any pain. All in all, it's been a rather pleasant experience. The staff at Hilcrest was great, Luke's been wonderfully patient (his homemade strawberry-banana milkshakes are fantastic), and best of all, I'm enjoying a three-day weekend filled with ice cream, pajama pants, and marathon phone calls with friends. I almost wish things were worse - then I'd have a reason to call in sick on Monday.

      The title is meant to be read to the tune of REM's "Losing My Religion." Clever, no?  Anyway, here I am, getting ready for the big day, for the moment when five of my teeth (four wisdom teeth plus one seriously decayed molar) will be viciously ripped from my gums. Just kidding - I don't think it will be that bad. The nice doctor will give me gas (get it? tee hee), drugs, and more drugs to get me through, and when it's all over, I get to go home and sleep. If I can manage to stay awake, I'll even be able to catch the  Monk  marathon on USA. Crazy detective.  A lot of the people I know who've had this done opted for going under, but in my case, I will be conscious throughout the whole thing. Some ideas I'm toying with include:  - staying up until the wee hours of the morning so that by the time I'm in the chair, I'll be so exhausted I'll pass out on my own  - bringing a walkman so that I can jam to some dope tunes while I'm all gassed up (I'm sorry, but it's funny every time I say it)  If you have others worth considering, be sure to share them before 7:30 tomorrow morning.

      ...because I am sick to death of hearing comments about how Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, is too old for the role. If they would take a few minutes to do the research, they would find out that Radcliffe was 11 when the filming of the first movie began - the same age as Harry in the first book. They would also know that he was 14 during the filming of the fourth movie, the same age that Harry is in the book.   They knock him for showing clear signs of puberty in the movie. He's 13! Voices change! Hair grows in places we don't talk about! What do they expect?! Radcliffe is experiencing the same changes we see Harry grapple with in the books. His portrayal does not take away from Harry's character - if anything, it enhances it. Furthermore, I would be outraged if they ditched the actor for a younger-looking Harry. Our favorite wizard does grow up, people! If you don't believe me, READ THE BOOKS!  And... I'm done.   In other news,  I am watching (and thoroughly enjoying) "Sex and the City" on TBS. One of the characters just said "blow job." Our little basic cable station is growing up.  P.S. I never realized how sexy Sarah Jessica Parker is. What a great head of hair. If only she'd ditch the cigarettes....

      I have often regretted my speech, never my silence. - Xenocrates   This quotation appeared as a tagline on one of my friend's e-mails, and I couldn't disagree with it more.  My  biggest regrets all result from keeping my mouth shut.  It's in my nature to please others. The last thing I want to do is to make someone uncomfortable, or angry, or hurt. So instead of getting things off my chest and trying to resolve whatever's bothering me, what do I do? Nothing. Well, my close friends will tell you, not  exactly  nothing. I may not come right out and say what's wrong, but my body language sure does. I know it does. I get snappy. Crabby. I push people away with sharp words and awkward silence. And all because I'm too afraid to put someone else on edge. Ironic, huh? I'm afraid to tell people what's wrong, so I let my actions do it instead, hoping that my loved ones are mind readers. How screwed up is that?  I'm trying to get better. If someone else is part of the problem, why not share that problem so that we can work towards a solution? Why am I so eager to feel like crap? Even Jesus shared his cross.  On a happier note: I finally received a note from  Glamour  magazine saying they received my entry for their "Tell Us The Story Of Your Life!" contest. Finalists will be notified at the end of the summer.

      It's funny how something you've had for a long time, for no apparent reason, suddenly becomes new. I was at work today, muddling through some awful spreadsheets, and I decided I needed some music. One of the few CDs I had to choose from was Tori Amos's  Boys For Pele , a CD I'd never listened to very much but recently drew from it to write a short story. So, I popped in the CD, letting it play through in its entirety for the first time since high school. Despite having it for seven years, I've never enjoyed this disc as much as I did today. It was the perfect soundtrack for a rainy afternoon.  With the ending of my spring quarter and the beginning of my newfound freedom, I'm having a hard time adjusting to my new blocks of time. So far, I've placed three orders with Shutterfly, taken a time machine to 1991, and finished the newest issue of  Entertainment Weekly  (Harry made the cover - Hooray!). My biggest accomplishments include registering for my writers conference (which actually is pretty important, since there are deadlines to meet) and sending in my Visa bill. Oh, well. Tomorrow is another day.

      May 1990 Dedicated to Randy Wooten  I've lost your love, and my heart is filled with pain. But I"ll risk my hopeless heart for you. "It's dangerous," my mind says. "You'll risk his happiness and joy, witch I'm sorry to say is not you."  "I'll take a chance," I said. "I'll do whatever it takes to make him mine. I'll take that chance."

      Clearly I'm enjoying my trip down Memory Lane. Indulge me.  Some of my friends and co-workers may remember me blogging about a little thing call The Chicago Chicks Club (see "My first blog" for details). My next venture? The Bon-Bon Club.  October 11, 1996 Friday night  This is to verify the existence of the Bon-Bon Club. To qualify as a member you must meet the following requirements:  1) Have imaginary guys chasing after you. [His name was Jeremiah. Sigh.] 2) Must be sitting at home every Saturday night. 3) Have an obsession with Meltaways, Twizzlers and other fatty junk foods. 4) Don't get any, at all.  Should a fellow member happen to violate any law (especially #4), Hooray! Congratulations! For the club to be void, both members must have a steady boyfriend (at the same time) for at least one month. Meetings are at least once a month.  X Jane Doe aka Hubba Bubba! X Breain Ma'Ayteh aka Chunky Monkey  Secret handshake!  * Names (except mine) have been changed to protect the innocent.

      I was speaking to a friend about the idea of diaries today, and it got me thinking about my own. Here's a sneak into my pre-pubescent years (I have no problems sharing them with you, as I was too young to think about anything more interesting than hating my family and having crushes on boys). Additional commentary is provided in brackets, which are not to be confused with parentheses or quotation marks, since I actually knew how to use them. Spelling errors and poor punctuation remain intact.   Saturday, March 3, 1990   Dear Diary, Hi. I don't think the world of Fred [Savage] anymore. I [heart] Jordan. He's from "New Kids on the Block." Also, when I look at Randy, I feel ... well ... good. I hope his emotions for me (if he has any) are strong, because I have very strong feelings for him.  Things aren't going to good at home. Samantha, Ryan, Mom, Dad, and Geo are sometimes trouble. But I'm used to it. Also, I wish I could see Ricardo more often.  Your writer, Breain   Sunday, May 27, 1990   Dear Diary, I hate my mother and Samantha, my sister. They don't care about me. All my mom worries about is if I don't listen to her.  Also, a long time ago, I dumped Jordan for  JOE MCINTYRE!  He is so cute. I want to marry him!  I saw Ricardo today tossing a ball. When I passed, he called me a Brain. If I was such a brain, I wouldn't have all these problems.  Breain   Wednesday, May 30, 1990   Dear Diary, Today was the Fun in the Sun. There was lots to do, but most of the time, all I did was look, and follow,  Randy Lee Wooten  He's not a new name, Diary. Well, I gotta go. Bye.  Breain   Thursday, May 16, 1991   Dear Diary, I'm in love with a boy named Scott Ramos. This is what I know.  Name: Scott Ramos Age: 11-12 Hair: black Eyes: brown One word description: babe  This is no mistake! Number: 247-1140  My only contact is Karen. Wish me luck. This guy is mine...at least, I hope so. Randy and Jason were fantasys. Reality came to me, and it came in the form of Scott Ramos.  [Heart] Breain   Sunday, June 2, 1991   Dear Diary, Scott was a mistake. But this guy isn't. (Hopefully.) I dream about him, daydream about him. I can't get him out of my mind. He's called Church Boy (C.B.) because I don't know his name.  I know this is brief, but soon all will be revealed. Soon, I repeat.  Breain   Monday, August 19, 1991   Dear Diary, Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Well, that's exaggerated. I feel rotten. Probably look rotten, too. Because I didn't wash the table right, Dad (who else?) blows up at me! "The only things you want to remember are from your books. That's gonna change!" So he made me get out my 3 collections, and put them on the kitchen table. Then he put them in a garbage bag. He (Dad) said he could make a bundle giving them to the thrift store, 10 cents a book. I hate my Dad the [insert nasty expletive]. Here's why.  1.) He took my books away. 2.) He's giving them away. 3.) He thinks "SWEET VALLEY HIGH" has sex in it, when he took a magazine and gave a gave a woman a 2 penises.  But 1 of the biggest reasons is that, like tons of other people, he thinks all I care about is reading, when the truth is, I have lots of interests. Here there are: (In no order)  1. Reading 2. Writing 3. Music 4. Singing 5. Baby-sitting 6. Journalism 7. Soccer 8. Volleyball 9. Computers. 10. Running. 11. Styles in hair/fashion 12. art  The other reason is that parents are mad because their kids read too little, but mine are mad because I read too much I'll hate my dad forever. Here my signature for that declaration of independence and to close my entry. Bye!  X [insert handwritten signature, complete with a star to dot my "i"] H.W. X Breain Ma'Ayteh P.  ---  Note: My dad never really gave the books away. He hid them in our basement for two months before giving them back.

      Ever since last week's fiction class, my brain has been swirling with the possibilities that writers have in this world and the opportunities I have to become a better one. I've just registered for the Midwest Writers Workshop at Ball State University at the end of July and signed up to for a subscription to  Poets and Writers  magazine. I also plan on joining the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) as soon as the financial burdens of paying for my wisdom teeth and workshop accomodations are done. I'm not saying that these things will guarantee growth, but they'll definitely provide motivation for it. They'll also give me a wider range of choices when I'm ready to look for a new job.  For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to write. My first story in the second grade spun a complex and thought-provoking plot involving two friends and their quest to quench their thirst for...CANDY! During the height of my horror-flick obsession, I penned two scary stories, even casting my friends as the characters for one of them. My fiction "masterpiece" was written when I was a teenager - the ultimate baby's mama drama. I remember coming home and holing up in my room for hours, blasting my cassette tapes while I wrote in the notebooks I was supposed to be using for school. Passion is so easy to sustain when you're a child. You don't know what it means yet to make excuses. What you want to do, you do.  When I think about having children of my own someday, I want most for them to find their own special talent, their own passion, and run with it, whether it's writing, dance, art, stamp collecting, whatever. And I want to help them do that. What good is having higher education and a good-paying job if you can't help your kids make their dreams come true? My parents did that for me - they read my stories, attended my contests, and gave me the confidence to keep pursuing what I loved. It's the least I can do for my own.

      Well, it's done. My spring quarter at DePaul is officially over. I have to say, I was a little sad at the end of my Screenwriting class last night. There were a lot of fun people I would've liked to have known better. Maybe our paths will meet up again in future classes, but maybe they won't. So, like I said, I was sad.  Then, on the drive from Chicago back to Rensselaer early this morning, I popped in some of my favorite nineties tunes to keep me awake, which got me thinking about my school years as a child. Instead of my last days, though, I focused on my first.  Every year, going back to school was a big deal. Because my family was a large one, we didn't have a ton of money for brand-name sneakers, jeans, accessories, and the like. I can remember the day before my first day of fifth grade, resorting to my mother's closet to find something hip to wear and feeling sad because I knew she needed new clothes just as badly as me. I ended up donning a hot pink t-shirt and rose-patterned short pants (not fashionable enough to be known as capris) with her best pair of white Keds. As my classmates showed up in Nikes and the latest trend in jeans, I was so embarassed. I shouldn't have been, but I was.  In middle school, it only got worse. Fashions changed almost monthly; my wardrobe did not. At one point in seventh grade, wearing shirts with athletic teams' names on them were all the rage. I couldn't get one until almost three months later, when the hype was long over (Charlotte Hornets - I knew nothing about the team except that I liked their mascot). At that point, I shouldn't have wasted the money, but sometimes having something late is better than never having it at all.  Sometimes I feel sad (apparently my word of the day) about moving into the future and away from my past. But it's those kind of memories that turn my sadness into relief. I was always so eager for approval, so wanting to be liked by others. I suppose there's still some of that in me today. But now I know when to say "Screw you, to hell what you think," and that makes me happy, too.

      Just moments ago, I put the finishing touches on my Screenwriting portfolio, and having finished my Fiction one this morning before lunch, this might be the first time in my life I'm not pulling a late night to complete a major class project. It feels good. After my classes tomorrow, I'll be school-free (well, except for work, I guess) until September's fall quarter, when I'll be taking The Personal Essay and Writing For Magazines. For the winter and spring, two electives. The end is near.  In the meantime, though, it's time for some SUMMER FUN! With tons of vacation days at my disposal, I have visions of  Friends -a-thons experienced with a tub of rainbow sherbet and my new Peace Frog pajama pants, dreams of rushing home after work to begin the Nancy Drew books (original hardcover, no less) I received for my birthday, which I've not yet had the time to touch. Even more exciting is the idea of watching  Days of Our Lives  and  All My Children  on their actual times instead of waiting for SoapNet reruns after 5:00. What will I do with my free time once I graduate? It's exciting to think about.  In other news:  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  opens this weekend, and I am pumped up, baby! Luke and I have discussed waiting until Sunday to hit the theatre, with the hope that the rush will have slowed down somewhat. I'm also diving into a project for the writer's group I belong to, The Prairie Writers Guild. Because of school, I've only been able to attend one meeting, but we're working on producing an anthology of our work, based on a theme of place. I've got to get cracking.  On a depressing note: I've still not heard back from  Glamour  regarding their "Tell Us The Story Of Your Life!" contest, for which I submitted an entry back in April. The magazine said to include an SASE so that everyone could receive word that their work had been received. The deadline was April 30th, and still nothing. I'm assuming it's because a publication of that size is still sifting through entries and not that mine was lost in the mail. My fingers are still crossed, though. Are yours?  P.S. for Chicago residents: Be sure to pick up your copy of  The Reader  on June 4th and read all about my literary experience at DePaul!

      At 9:00 tonight, my parents will drop Samantha off at O'Hare airport so that she can make the big trip to Africa with SJC Habitat For Humanity members. Everyone's a little nervous to see her go, but I admire her so much for going to a place outside of her comfort zone in order to experience something new.  Meanwhile, as Ryan prepares for college life at Columbia and Saint Joe welcomes another freshman class, I can't help but remember what that time was like for me. The memories are fuzzy, not because I can't recall them, but because it feels like they happened to somebody else, not me. I think about my first roommate and clinging to her as we traveled from Chicago to a little town whose name I couldn't even pronounce. I hated the bugs, the lack of public transportation, the absence of a mall. I missed my family and friends. I missed feeling confident in the person I was. Thinking about that makes it even funnier to me that, almost seven years later, I'm still here.  While I certainly wasn't a wild child, there were definitely a few crazy times that I like to think about and laugh about; getting drunk for the first time; receiving out-of-town visitors at 3:00 in the morning; going to parties, throwing up, and then partying some more. Staying up late to play cards and eat Little Debbie snack packs, the mother of all food groups for broke teenagers. I can't say I had a bad time.  Some people say they don't believe in having regrets; because we have free will, we should embrace each choice we've made because it's our own. I don't think that's true. Having free will doesn't mean having full understanding of ourselves and our actions, and I sometimes wish I had branched out a little more in college--made a bigger effort to know more people, go out on a limb, try new things. As I see Ryan saving up money for dorm furniture and picking out her fall classes, it's hitting me harder than ever that I can never go back to that place again. I will never be 18 years old again. Never again will my life revolve around school. Gone are the days where 20 bucks could last me two weeks because all I needed was money for Grandma's pie. No more waiting for 3 a.m. visitors. I'm just too damn tired.  The upside: I'm glad I can't go back. I was too insecure, too dependent on the people around me, people who couldn't even get their own act together. It's only now that I truly feel confident in who I am and who I've become. But if I could capture those days on video, the good times and the bad, I'd happily watch them all.

       urlLink   &nbsp;   That's how I felt in this outfit at Samantha and Ryan's joint graduation party on Saturday, having more to do with the pigtails and less with my attire, but I felt fun, too. I haven't worn pigtails since grade school.   On July 1st, I had just one Visa card. By August, the number changes to four as I signed up for a New York and Company credit card over the weekend. One hundred and sixty-five dollars in a half-hour. Am I really good or just really gullible? To avoid repeating mistakes from years past, I am more cautious with my purchases when I get home, no longer in a hurry to rip off the tags and stuff&nbsp;my&nbsp;latest finds&nbsp;into&nbsp;the closet without giving them another once-over, trying pants on with heeled shoes and tops on with just the right bra. (It does make a difference, people.) Anyway, everything passed inspection except for one pair of black pants, which I can just return in a couple of weeks when I go back to NY & C and spend my special City Cash coupons. City Cash is the best invention ever. They pick a week to dole them out and for every 30 bucks you spend, they give you a $15 coupon. The best thing about them is that you can use them all together, so $120 worth of clothes quickly turns into $60. I earned $175 in discount spending, so come the first weekend in August, Ellie Mae will be camping out at Southlake Mall.   However, as fun as my shopping sprees are, I also realize all that card&nbsp;swiping has&nbsp;been getting to my head. My paycheck is already close to gone, leaving me with pennies to buy groceries. At first, I thought I could manage on grilled cheese and green beans until next Friday. Then I thought, "If I can justfiy almost $500 on clothes, why can't I charge one fifth of that on that which keeps me alive?" So I did, and it felt good. Spaghetti, fruit snacks (what did I tell you?), chicken, hamburger, Little Debbies, frozen pizzas.... My God, it was almost like I was at The Limited.&nbsp;The feeling of&nbsp;guilty pleasure in buying what I can't afford was ultimately the same.   But so what? I'm not married, I don't have kids, and I'm not buying crack. I wore great shoes to work and cooked up a mean Sloppy Joe for dinner. All in all, not a bad day.

      For the last couple of weeks I've felt trapped in a state of inactivity. It begins the minute I walk in the door after work, drop my keys on the kitchen table, and turn on the air conditioner. After changing my clothes, most of the time I end up sitting on&nbsp;the couch flipping through TLC design shows and reruns of soap operas until a phone call or visitor stirs me into action. Sometimes I read, sometimes I don't. In any case, my motivation level is extremely low.   I'm not sure why this is happening, but then again, I can probably guess. I've been pretty broke lately, paying for my writers workshop, paying off credit cards, paying, paying, always paying for something. Then there's Rensselaer, a place that I really enjoy most of the time and then get angry at when I want to browse through the aisles of Barnes and Noble without making an hour-and-a-half round trip just to get there. Then there's my job, which I&nbsp;like most of the time but right now feel pressure to complete projects my heart&nbsp;can't get&nbsp;into. All of these factors make it even more exciting that I'm supposed to leave this Wednesday for my workshop, to start my first actual vacation of the summer, thanks to the President's emergency priority list; to flea to a place where new ideas will be in the air; to a place that's anything but&nbsp;work. I've also entered one of my short stories into a contest and&nbsp;am anxious to learn the results.   I'm thinking about all of this because on Monday, Samantha told me that my Auntie Debbie is in the hospital again. My aunt has been fighting brain cancer since I was a junior in high school and is getting steadily worse. However, as concerned as I am for my aunt and her family, I started thinking, "If she dies now, there goes my workshop. There goes the break I've been waiting for." For that reason alone I've been too scared to call and ask how she's doing.   I know, I know - it's horrible.   After a statement like that, I don't think a positive ending is possible, so I'll just stop here.

      The newest installment of VH-1 pop-culture programming debuted this past Monday, and unlike the '70s and '80s, in the '90s I was both alive and old enough to connect with everything the panel members are talking about.   Since I sooo enjoy "listing," here are some of my own reasons for loving the '90s:    New Kids on the Block   I had plenty of trading cards and those cheap buttons you found in the dispensers at the grocery store. However, we never had the money for the actual music. To make the kid in me feel better, I finally bought  Hangin' Tough  on cassette when I was 15.    Neon   I wore it all the time, all the while never worrying about a matching color palate. My favorite outfit consisted of a green shirt, blue shorts, and red Keds.    Ding Dong Ditch   The kids in my neighborhood played this game daily during the summer until one of our victims threatened to call the police.    Seven Up   Even though I was almost never picked. :(    Teen Beat   I wanted to read  17 , but my mom thought it was "too old" for me. Like talking about STDs and birth control is inappropriate for children or something. To say the least, I was disappointed, but  Teen Beat  did have a great Eddie Furlong poster for me to tape on my hamper.    Kissy Fur   I may be the only person my age who remembers this cartoon, but it was way cool. "Gaaators!"    Sweet Valley High   And my mom thought  17  was inappropriate.... Just kidding - this series never talked about the kids who scored beyond first base. I'm sure it was part of the inspiration behind  Beverly Hills, 90210 , as it took place in California and half of the student body was rich. Which brings me to...    Beverly Hills, 90210   I always rooted for Kelly, even when she and Dylan fooled around behind Brenda's back. My sister Samantha and I used to listen to the soundtrack all the time. Remember that? I'm almost embarassed to admit that I bought it used on CD way after the craze was over. Almost.  * It should be noted that my parents did not approve of  90210 , so half the time I had to find wait for my friends to tell me what happened on the school bus the next day. You can imagine the chaos that erupted when I tried to watch  Melrose Place .    The Baby-Sitters Club   I was so into this club that I started my own - The Chicago Chicks Club - only we were less about baby-sitting (OK, not at all about baby-sitting) and more about eating candy and plugging dirty words into Mad Libs books. Stacey was my favorite sitter, but I was probably more like Kristy - tomboyish and bossy. I even wrote an anthem and made all the club members sing it before meetings. Approach me when I've got a couple of Sky Blues in my system and I'll sing it to you.    I'm Telling!   The best teen game show ever!   I could go on and on, but I won't. Instead, I will ask: What do YOU love about the '90s?

      Tonight, feeling somewhat literary as I began proofreading the first four chapters of Chris's novel, I came across a character, Mackenzie, who had an obsession with one of the boys at his school. Later, Mackenzie realized how badly he wanted to befriend him.  How easy it is to harvest an obsession, for whatever reason, especially when you're in high school. You're still so impressionable, still on the prowl for an everyday hero. It was around my junior year that I found one of my own. Her name was Ellen, and I thought she was one of the prettiest girls I'd ever seen. She had this great long brown hair and a sharp sense of humor that couldn't be matched. Ellen was a part of every vital organization my high school had - student council, theatre, Christian Life Community, etc. - and was always surrounded by a crowd of people wherever she went. My eyes followed her movements during lunchtime, sought her out in the classes we shared.... Sometimes just being within earshot of her was enough to warm me up for the rest of the day. I took a picture of the two of us from one of the school plays and stored it in my memory box, the same place that housed love letters and mementos from old boyfriends. I even wrote a poem about her, never telling anyone but my sister who it was about.  Sounds like love, doesn't it? Maybe it was. I certainly admired Ellen for being so confident and witty and self-assured, never caring about what people thought about her but still doing her best to make others feel welcome. We were in a lot of the same activities together, and I thought we were so much alike, both of us spreading ourselves thin, both of us aiming for that star with your name written all over it. I used to pray to God for us to become closer, for her to see in me just a little bit of what I saw in her. I remember one night needing to call her at home about some drama club meeting and I nearly wet myself out of fear. I dialed her number and hung up twice beore actually completing the call. And, honestly, I think part of the reason I chose Saint Joe was so that I could be around Ellen just a little while long. When I latch on to people, it's always a struggle to let them go.  I don't feel the same way about Ellen anymore, and I used to wonder what the hell was wrong with me for tagging along after some girl like a little lost puppy. But now I realize how simple it was: I just wanted to be understood. Ellen never did - at least, not in the way I wanted her to - but she gave me something to look forward to, something to strive for, and that was enough. After all, that's what the people in your life are for, no matter who they are.

      This is the question that comes to mind every time I hear this song. (You  know  what song I'm talkin' about, don't you? After all, it made VH-1's list of 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs.) So, here are some of my own ideas:  1. Foot the bill. 2. Be your baby's daddy. 3. Sleep in the wet spot. 4. Perform the act that causes the wet spot. 5. Wang Chung tonight. 6. Touch your feet. 7. Eat a taco. 8. Go the extra mile. 9. Learn to drive a stick shift. 10. Rock the vote.  Boy, do I enjoy making lists.

      I received my first credit card the summer before my junior year - a pretty blue-and-grey striped Visa card with a $250 limit. By the end of that calendar year, the limit was up to $1,000 and I had spent $750 on painfully classy shoes, clothes I quickly fell out of love with, and gas for my many, many trips to Chicago. Four years, three cards, and a few thousand dollars later, I decided enough was enough. I gathered the courage to cut all of my cards (even my sexy tiger-striped Capital One) and go cold turkey on outlandish spending. As a result, I became a much smarter shopper. Have I enjoyed shopping sprees since then? Most definitely. But my new Spidey sense cut down on the number of clothes I ended up "dumping" once they reached my doorstep, far away from the pressure of the mall. Every department store that offered me a "very special credit offer" was delivered a resolute "No."   That is, until Friday. I guess you could say I fell off the wheel.  I couldn't help it. The Limited was having an outrageous sale, and for those familiar with The Limited, price slashing in that store is not to be ignored. Fifty-dollar capris at half-off. Darling $40-collar sweaters for a fin. Not having those clothes because I was low on cash was simply not option, nor was it it ammunition enough to keep me from signing up for my very own The Limited credit card. I confess, though, that my shameless spending at Victoria's Secret was less about necessity and more about "But they're so pretty!" I will receive my permanent Angels card in five to seven days.  For the 45-minute ride home from Lafayette, I felt defeated. My hard work at fending off "fluffy" credit cards and sinful shopping sprees was shot in one two-hour period. My spirits weren't lifted until I modeled every single garment in the comfort of my apartment and thought, "Damn, these clothes make me look cute. If only I had new shoes...."  The next day: Merrillville's Southlake Mall. I spent a combined $75 on New Balance sneakers and two great summer sandals from Payless. I found a great pair of Sherpa flip-flops for only $9. Nine dollars!... Don't you look at me like that. A deal's a deal, no matter what form of payment you choose. What would you have done, huh? WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?  I may be crazy, but at least my bras and underwear match beautifully.

      I am continually amazed at how easily my mood can change, how waking up to a bright sunny day can erase the bad feelings that were gathered just the night before. For example: yesterday I was in a constant state of nervousness - thinking about work, unfinished writing projects and money, and wondering if I'll have the time to watch the  Sex and the City  videos I rented from Blockbuster before their tomorrow due date. I spent over three hours painting my fingernails for the first time in my life, finally crawling under the covers at almost 2:00 in the morning. This morning, though, I woke up inspired with potential writing genius and the mindset that this, too, shall pass. It doesn't take much for me to get worked up; more people than I care to admit can testify to that. Today may be the first day I've truly understood that:  1. The "big things" in life are always unpredictable, so just roll with the punches  2. Brooding over how much work there is to do just prevents you from actually getting it done  3. Savings accounts were made to be emptied  4. It's perfectly normal to recover from writer's block the morning a piece is due  5. I can buy  Sex and the City  on DVD (which can be accomplished by doing #3)  6. Nail polish is fun, even when it's a pain in the a**  and, finally,  7. God won't give you more than you can handle.  See ya - I've got a story to write.

      I'm back from another conference, and today, sitting here in my pink piggy slippers this Saturday morning, I'm excited at the prospect of spending a day in town. Who'd have thought? There will be laundry to wash, floors to clean, books to read, and manuscripts to proof. (Chris: sorry for the delay.) It's also a beautiful sunny day, so I might even walk to Brookside Park and have some fun on the swings.  In case you haven't noticed, I've been away from home a lot these last couple of weeks, and when I came home yesterday, I found the nicest surprise in my freezer: a quart of peanut butter ice cream from Busy Bee, courtesy of my sweet, wonderful boyfriend. It reminds me of one of the many reasons I love him so much: he doesn't just listen; he remembers. Last November, as Busy Bee was preparing to close up shop for the winter, the second-to-last "Flavor of the Day" was peanut butter, a flavor NOT well represented in grocery stores - or, at the very least, Pick and Save. By the time I got to Busy Bee to experience this coveted taste one more time, they'd run out. I was crushed. So when Luke saw they were stocked with it while I was in Chicago, he bought me my very own quart, just so I wouldn't miss it again.  In a world where many women measure the quality of their relationships in fancy dinners, expensive jewelry, and how successful their partners are at the art of mindreading, I don't think it's at all wrong for me to measure mine in peanut butter. I'll come out a winner every time.

      Well, I'm back from my writers workshop ,and I must say it was wonderful. I was in the company of published authors, people who turned their ideas into words and their words into a hardback masterpiece. Not only were the featured speakers impressive, I was amazed at the number of attendees who had published their own work. One woman had written an eight-book series about a pre-teen detective; others had clippings from magazines like  Time ,  Writer's Digest , and other national publications. On my last day, I sat in on a "Time Management For Writers" seminar and was encouraged to create a long-term plan for my writing - map out my ultimate goals and then move Heaven and Hell to see them through. That's when I realized I wasn't sure what they were.  If you were to ask me where I want to be in five years, I could do it in less than a minute without batting an eye: I want to have (at the very least) a master's degree. Be married. Have children. Live closer to my family. Continue writing. However, if you were to ask me where I want to be  with my writing  in five years, I'd have to scratch my head and say, "Argh?" Since I knew how to read, I knew I wanted to write. And I did. I knew I wanted others to read what I wrote. And they do, from old stories (Leslie!) to to new stories (Chris!) to these very blog entries (you!). But that was as far as I got.  One of the points made over the weekend that I truly appreciated was that "being published" means something different to every writer. Some have their sights set on the Barnes and Noble best sellers table. Others are perfectly content with running copies from a computer and passing out stapled pages to friends and family members. What does it mean to me?  I want my ideas to be heard. I want to write about the most humiliating and earth-shattering moments in my life so that someone can say, "She had the guts to say what I couldn't. I know exactly what she means." I don't have to see my stuff at the B and N for that to happen.  I learned a lot about the self-publishing business over the weekend and have been seriously weighing its advantages. Taking ownership of my writing and deciding how and when it will appear to others is definitely appealing. We'll see what happens. For now, though, I'm going to work on an idea I have for a non-fiction story collection. Dave Sedaris isn't the only writer who can make a person wet her pants and wipe a tear at the same time. At least, that's what I'm counting on.
