           I just bought a Moon Patrol arcade game.  I guess since this is my first blog I should tell you that I am obsessed with arcade games.  If I had tons of money and space I would buy games all the time.  Right now though I only have five.  Burgertime, Frogger, Bump n Jump, Donkey Kong Jr and my newest addition, Moon Patrol.        When I was a kid my parents had Intellivision.  All of these games remind me of how much fun we used to have while playing these games.  So I guess now, being in my 20s, it is nice to be back in my childhood and thinking of the days when there were so few worries.  Plus my friend just reminded me yesterday that for every arcade game you own you can take a year off your age.  Wow now I feel young!

      I guess it has been a really long time since my last post.  I am sure most people that know me are not surprised by this because I tend to start things and not finish them.  I want to change that about myself but I change my interests often.  I have also been busy with work whcih has made me tired.  Not that it is a very good excuse but that is my reason.    So what is happening in my life.....I guess a lot is happening.  I have decided to move back home.  Now that should be interesting.  Moving back ni with my brother and my dad is definitely going to be an experience.  Just being home for a weekend is an experience so being there all the time might actually drive me insane.  I am still going to work for Jamba but just as an assisstant at a store in nor cal.  It will be weird not to be the manager but I am looking forward to not jumping into a new group of team members.  That is pretty much the focus right now in my life.  I find myself driving to work and my eyes are watering because even though I make fun of the OC all the time there is a lot that I will miss.  More importantly there are some very important  people that I will miss so much.  I have always been a wuss wen it somes to good byes so I guess I cannot expect this to be easy.  I just keep telling myself that this is a move that I have to make and hope that all ends up in the end. I guess we will see.   My goal is simple. It is complete understanding of the universe, why it as it is and why it exists as all. - Stephen Hawking

      Today was one of the most unproductive days I have had in a very long time.  I had the day off and every time I thought about doing anything I kept thinking that these days of doing nothing but watching TV and surfing the internet are so few and far between that I should take advantage of them.  So I did nothing.  I woke up early but that was about it.  I even had to pick someone up from work at 4:30pm but was late because I was sleeping.  I did manage to leave the house to get boba tonight.  What a fantastic day!  We rented Spellbound tonight.  I love documentaries.  Especially about crazy kids in a spelling bee.  It kept me interested the entire time.  Which is surprising considering it is about a spelling bee.  These kids took it very seriously.  Some of them were practicing spelling almost 8 hours a day.  I mean they are 12-14 yrs old....shouldn't they be outside playing sports or using their youth to discover alcohol, sex and drugs.  Anyways I enjoyed it and cannot wait to watch the other winning movie that we rented "Stuck on You" tomorrow.  Ca'Chet got free tickets to Wango Tango tomorrow from her boss at work.  I guess Starbucks is a sponsor.  So tomorrow I will be with the millions of teeny boppers who actually paid (or their parents) to see such winning acts such as, Enrique Iglesias, Clay Aiken and the best one of all, William Hung.  I seriously refuse to watch Clay Aiken and William Hung so I guess I will have to cover my ears and quickly exit.  We even have good seats....20 rows back from the stage and right in the center.  Why couldn't it be for a concert where the average age is over 13?  I will enjoy seeing Janet Jackson and Maroon 5.  I don't know if I would pay to see Janet but I am sure she puts on a really good show.  There will be some others that I will not mind seeing but the Clay and William parts just will not get out of my head.  I am sure I will have many things to say after my 10 hours (yes I said 10...it takes place from 1pm-11pm) of screaming teeny boppers and having to see Clay without being able to throw bottles at him.

      I know most people are always saying that they never have good luck when it comes to gambling and winning things but I can truly say that I have never really had luck in winning.  I have bought Lotto scratchers since...well lets just say that there has been many and I have never won more that the normal ticket or $2 here and there.  Well today this has changed.  I won $100 on a scratcher.  I know to some people they may not think this is much but to me I might as well have won the jackpot.  This definitely made my day.  I needed this good night because with all of my favorite shows being over for the season I think I am going through teen drama withdrawal.  I still have Gilmore Girls for one more week.  This last episode was so good!  I am always a sucker for the longtime crushes finally getting together story lines.  Gilmore Girls are full of those right now.  After next Monday what will I do.  I think I am officially over the MTV reality series.  I think they have just started to make me too depressed about the 20 somethings of today.  If the older generations think that these dumb and crazy people are a good representation of my age group then we are in serious trouble.  I love watching these shows and seeing the one girl/guy who is so in love with the girl/guy back home and hopes that this experience will do nothing but bring them closer together.  I mean have they ever watched these shows....I can already tell them that it will not last.  But they keep telling everyone that their love is the real thing.  Then in a few months at the reunion show we find out..to everyone's surprise that they have broken up.....what a shocker.  And guess what...they are now looking into a career in acting.  I think it is about time they change the name of the Real World to something more appropriate like Stupid Sluts and Man Whores made to Live and Work together, complain as much as possible, drink too much and basically look like as big of crap heads possible....but I guess that might be too long.

      I am obsessed with WB shows.  Mostly Everwood, One Tree Hill and Gilmore Girls.  I mean who can resist these shows full of teen angst and teenagers who talk like they have studied the thesaurus their entire lives.  If they are so smart why do they make such bad decisions?  My favorite thing to do is to talk for the characters before they do.  This is very annoying to those who watch with me but it can also be hilarious.  It is sad but I am usually right...so predictable.  All of these shows are following the same story lines.....love triangle, girl gets pregnant...oh no what should we do.  I know they sound dumb and oh so predictable but I love them all the same...oh how I will miss them over the summer.  At least I will have new Six Feet Under starting in June.....my hero!  Do you know how wonderful flossing is?  For most times I am not really worried about brand names.  I am just looking for the least expensive and that is okay with me.  But I have now discovered Glide Comfort Plus floss.  Oh my goodness I will never go back to the regular harsh on my gums floss.  This stuff is so smooth.    As you can tell small things really excite me.  Nothing is greater than finding something like new floss, or listening to the radio and hearing the exact song you wanted to hear.  Life is too short not to pay attention to these little things.  By the way Super Dope has not died yet but if she could talk to me she would definitely have to be censored...whoops :(

      So now that it is getting closer to moving I think it is finally setting in.  There is so much to do before I am ready to leave.  Now everywhere I go I think, "this may be the last time I ever go to (fill in blank)."  How cheesy is that.  I went to an Angels game on Saturday night.  Some of us from work went.  Why is it always when you are ready to make a change in your life everything starts working out for you and now you are not sure if that decision to change was necessary.  I am the worst decision maker....ever!  I always question myself to the point where I drive myself insane.  I just hope that mving back up noeth is a decision that I will not regret.    In other important news I am now playing Sims Bustin Out and I think that I am going to kill her.  The game is crazy.  I cannot get her to do anything right.  First of all she has a roommate who is such a pig.  Why should my character, her name is Super Dope, clean up all the time.  I want to control her roommate Mimi too and make that biatch clean up her own dishes and nasty bathroom.  Plus I have not quite figured out when she needs certain things.  I know how to check her different levels of need but geez she needs a lot of attention.  I could not figure out what this one section meant but I quickly figured out when in the middle of the kitchen Super Dope peed all over the floor.  As funny as it was to watch I don't think it made her mood any better.  I think it is only time before I start trying to find the kill your Sim option.  Super Dope is too much work!  Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.  --Jack Handey, Deep Thoughts

      I'm fucked up.  I was seriously feeling like puking but I feel better now.  I was to the point of making up songs about mashed potatoes....let me tell you those were some good songs.  I know there are a million things I should be doing but who the hell cares.  I am going to miss corn off the cart from the man who comes around our complex.  He brings the corn around in a trash can, put some mayo stuff on it, butter, parmesan cheese and chili powder.  I know it sounds nasty but seriously you have to taste it.  There will definitely not be any corn seller in Novato.  That will be sad.  I love corn.  Every time my boss lectures me about anything and the tells a war story I now feel a smile come across my face.....only 3 more days of him!  It has been a fun experience but time to move on from the craziness.  I might get another arcade game from someone at work that wants it out of his garage.  My dad would love knowing that there is another game to move...hehe.  Hopefully it will be a good weekend.  Nothing much planned for the next 2 days but on Sunday I am hanging out with Miss Jane Chu.  I am going to miss her.  She is so full of energy and can always make me laugh.  Whatever we decide to do she always makes it fun.  Maybe know she will find some time to come visit my house up north.

      Denial.  That is definitely what I am feeling right now.  Everyone keeps asking me how much I have packed.  I mean do they know me?  Do I ever have anything packed until right before I have to move?  I don't think it has set in how close the time is coming until I leave.  13 days left.  Oh my god I should start packing some shit.  The most annoying is going to be all of the little stuff that I do not really need but I cannot let go of.  Where is Kevin when I need him?  He is the exact opposite...he throws everything away and was actually able to get me to clean my room when I lived at home.  I think there was something ridiculous like 9 bags of shoes and clothes that I gave to Goodwill.  I wonder if there is really someone out there wearing my puff paint NKOTB t-shirt?  I hope so....I would hate to see that thrown away.  I have started packing up my console video games.  I really need to start with some clothes.  All of this is too much for me.  I am the kind of person who starts cleaning and then I find some pictures that I have not looked at for awhile so I sit down and look at them and then a couple hours later I realize I have made more of a mess than cleaning anything.  So basically packing will not be fun because first of all I don't want to do it and second off all I have too much crap.  So Gilmore Girls had their season finale last night.  I got teary eyed.  Not a full oh my god that was so sad cry but a oh that situation would suck and I feel bad for her cry.  I won't bore you with what it was about but they left it open for an interesting season next fall.  What will I do without the WB all summer?  I saw that they have a new show starting just for the summer.  Hopefully it will get me through the summer until next year.    I started using my iPod again yesterday.  I definitely took it for granted.  I got a cool cover for it so I am ready to go.  It is so easy.  Having a ton of your music in one device.  That is an awesome invention.  Well I will definitely be using it more often now and I cannot believe how long I have let it sit and not touched it.    On a more serious note I just found out that one of my good friends might be deployed.  This is the first person that is close to me that I has been deployed.  He will know in the next few days if he has to go over but he was called up for training.  I did not think that it would hit me this hard but I am extremely upset over this.  I know that it is important for the country for him to go but just seeing his face and knowing that he will be sent into a place where it is uncertain if he will return scares me more than I thought it would.  He is such an incredible guy and I have loved getting to know him. I love his energy and how kind he is.  He makes me feel good and that can be hard to do.  I hope he doesn't have to go.  Geez being sent to war sure makes my problems look dumb.

      Wango Tango was tiring.  I think I am too old for these teeny bopper concerts.  We sat in traffic for over an hour getting there which is always a huge pain in the ass.  Then when we got there you had to get a wristband for field seats and they were super disorganized and it took forever to get the bands.....there were some very upset mom in line.  There were the expected scantily clad teenage girls.  I always wonder what they think will happen.....do they really believe that Pharrell is going to be so turned on by then in the audience that he will jump off the stage and decide that he has to have them right there?  I doubt that any of the performers would want to go the Michael Jackson or R. Kelly way and mess around with these girls that still play with Barbie.  Anyways, our seats were awesome.  They were right next to the catwalk on the field.  So we got some very close up pics.  Some of the better performances were Black Eyed Peas and Big Boi from Outkast.    Janet performed for a super short period of time but she was entertaining.  N.E.R.D did a great job of getting the crows all hyped up...plus getting to see Pharrell up close with no shirt on was definitely worth going to a concert and have to sit and watch Clay Aiken.  Not a big fan of Enrique Iglesias but he brought some woman on stage for "Hero" and she molested him which was really funny.  She grabbed onto his ass cheeks so tightly I am sure he has bruises.  Maroon 5 was cool to see live.  I did not realize the lead singer was so hot!  We left before William Hung...thank god for that.  They actually had him close the show...most people left before that.  I think that overall it was fun because I got to see some performers that I like but would normally not pay to see but had fun watching.  I got a little bit of a tan and got to do a lot of people watching.  All in all it was a fun day.  We did not get home until almost 2am and lucky me I got to open at 7am so I knew that Sunday was going to be a day from hell.  Work was not too bad but I was really tired when I got home.  I was going to take a nap when I got home but my nap that started at 6pm ended up lasting until Monday morning.  So I missed Sopranos last night.  Luckily they repeat it so I will be sure to catch it tonight.  Also tonight is the season finale of Gilmore Girls.  Hopefully Luke and Lorelei will get together...aaaahhhh what a happy ending...but I am sure there will be some twist.  Sunday was the last day on the floor for me at work.  Now I am trying to get the store ready for when I am gone.  The problem is the person taking over for me does not want to put in the effort to take over so it is going to be hard.  He also just told me yesterday that he is going to try to put a lead from his store who was planning to move but has decided to stay in charge of my store for awhile.  So it is all confusing.  Plus she has no idea how my store is run and have this feeling that the team members at my store will not respond to her style very well.  I just want to leave the store with the best chance of surviving all of this but it is out of my hands now.  I will try to do my best to set it up but now it is up to someone else to make the big decisions.  I am going in today to do an orientation for some new team members, which seems dumb because I will never work with them, but it was not my bright idea for me to do it.  See what I mean about this not being my problem anymore.  I am just going to let them ruin the store and then maybe realize that they should have listened to me...or blame it all on me....which is fine because I will be long gone.  Sorry to complain about work crap but I guess it is consuming me right now.

      Even though it is Tuesday and it seems like the weekend was so far away I will still give a recap.  Friday was chill.  Nothing too exciting.  Just hung out with the roommates, saw Shrek 2, and thought about (not actually doing anything) what I should be packing.  Saturday was errand and cleaning day.  I don't usually feel like cleaning so when I do I embrace it.  I even cleaned my room...which was an amazing job.  Later on my friend Ryan came over to chill.  We ate some In-n-Out and just chatted.  We always have a good time discussing all of the stupid people in the world and the backwards thinking that many people (even the ones we know) have in their life.  On Sunday I woke up way too early and went into work.  Got some crap taken care of and then off to Temple City to visit with Miss Chu.  We ate some Korean food and watched a Day Without a Mexican.  For the most part the Korean food was yummy but when eating my tofu soup I found a shrimp and it still had its eyes.  EEWW!  The Korean bbq was great and whatever sauce they use for it is amazingly good.  A Day Without a Mexican was okay.  I expected more from it.  The idea to show the impact to California's economy if there were no Mexicans was a good one but something was missing.  They made the movie too cheesy and it took away from their point.  It made it seem more like a fictional movie with a few real facts.  I think that if you want to get your point across you have to really show the impact using a real-life example that people can relate to and something that really hits home.  This just seemed like a joke and I don't think it was as impacting as it could have been.  After watching some Chapelles show at Janes we were off to the airport to pick up Jared.  Jared is someone I have known my entire life.  He is my mom's best friends son.  He lives in New Jersey and was in San Fran for work and then headed down to So Cal for some vaca.  We just bummed around yesterday and then I was off to my last store meeting at Tustin Jamba.  It just made me realize how comfortable I had gotten there and how much for the better the store had gotten over the last 1 and a half years.  Not just because of me but because of the team that I had.  Yeah I had some problems with people and had to deal with some crazy employees but for the most part they are a team of great people and I appreciate the work they have done.  Only 2 more days of Tustin Jamba......wow!  Now it is 7am and I have no idea why I am up.  I guess I will get ready and go into work for awhile.  Vegas is only 2 days away...maybe I will win lots of money and not have to go back to work.  I guess I can dream!

      Moving sucks.  Luckily I had a ton of help so it went pretty smoothly.  Thanks to everyone who helped!  I filled a 17' u-haul and I am not looking forward to unpacking it.  I think my dad is still trying to figure out where I plan on putting all of this crap.  I have a feeling I will be unpacking forever.  Now I am home and it I think it will feel like I am visiting until I get settled.  I am sure I will complain about the move enough so I will move on for today.  Having my dad visit was fun.  We went to Vegas for a night.  I actually came out ahead.  Only by about $80 but it is definitely better than coming back with no money.  Vegas is always fun.  We just stayed for the night but in Vegas sometimes that is more than enough time to gamble because if it was any longer I probably would have put all the money I won back into the machines.  I saw Saved! on Saturday.  It was very funny.  People who are crazy Christians should see that movie.  I wonder if they would think that they would think that the crazy actions in the movie was normal.  That would be even scarier.  Orange County was full of crazy Christians so it was scary to see a movie trying to be exaggerated but scarily true to life.  We went to Downtown Disney that night.  Just walked around an people watched a bit.  It is funny how people will where the silliest looking clothes to Disneyland and somehow it is ok.  Makes for some funny people watching.  On Sunday we got some fro yo and then headed down to Corona del Mar.  Just say and enjoyed the people watching and ocean air.  My dad got some good pictures and we just sat and chatted.    Monday was moving day and then we all went to dinner at Macaroni Grill.  Tuesday morning I drove back up to Nor Cal and unpacked some.  I don't even think that I made a dent in the pile of crap.    Today I woke up early and am now thinking of anything to do but unpack.  Ca'Chet flies in tonight and will be staying for a few days.  We will be painting my room and trying to get some unpacking done.  I bet she is excited.  Well I guess I have procrastinated enough...time to start on the u-haul :(

      The fun is over and now it is time to get to work and some real cleaning and unpacking.  I had tons of fun when CaChet was here and it still has not sunk in that I am here permanently and not going back to so cal.  Went to see Dashboard Confessional the other night.  I have liked them for awhile and have wanted to see them.  Not that fond of the new album but loved the last album.  I dragged CaChet along and we were pleasantly surprised.  Besides the stupid emo kids the concert was great.  The next night we went to see the play Hairspray.  It was so much fun.  All of the singers were incredible and the whole thing was upbeat and so alive.  Both of these nights we were coming home after midnight and I came to the sad realization that nothing is open here after about 9pm.  If you are hungry after 9 you have the choice of Dennys or 7-11.  I guess eating early will be the only choice.  CaChet, Joel and my dad decided to go to the Indian casino around here and I had dinner with Paula and Corrina.  It was nice to sit and chat.  It is funny because no matter what else is going on or how much we change the three of us can get together and we can pick up from exactly where we left off from the last time we spoke.  They have both been a huge part of my life and I hope we can hang out more now that I am home.  The next night we CaChet and Joel wanted to go back to the casino so we all went.  I lost but did not bring that much so it was ok.  Cheryl, who worked with CaChet at Starbucks, drove up from Gilroy and we all got to hang out in the city for the day.  We went to the Park Chalet which is a nice restaurant overlooking Ocean Beach.  We mostly just chatted and toured the city.  Yesterday I had my orientation with my new District Manager.  He seems lie a good guy and he has worked for Jamba for a long time so hopefully he will be a good guy to work for.  We went over paperwork and talked about training.  Tonight I leave for Modesto and I start my official training tomorrow morning.  I don't do very well with alone time so this should be interesting.  When I am alone I think and when I think I go crazy.  Hopefully the hotel will be nice and the Jamba where I train is in good shape.  Well wish me luck in fun Modesto and I am sure there will be lots to say when I return...

      Modesto sucks!  I am having to spend the whole week in this black hole of a city and to top it off I am not learning anything.  Not to go into it too much but I will give you a little preview.  I wake up at about 5 every morning and head to the store.  The manager says that he will be in at about 6am to start training so we (another girl Jamie is training with me)  wait patiently.  We work on the front line and put up with his lazy but enthusiastic about life team members.  About 9am he shows up and then we continue to work on the front line until he is done settling in. About 5 hours later after we have just worked our asses off to pick up the slack that his wonderful TMs have caused he decides to pull us off of the line and chat.  We learn something small...most of the stuff I already know and then he sends us home.  Good thing I am learning how to make smoothies the entire day...oh no wait I have already been doing that for the past 7 YEARS!!  He tries to cut labor and since we don't count towards his labor he sends home all of his TMs and just figures we can work in their place.  Isn't he sweet?  The I head back to my hotel at about 4pm...by the way it is still about 90 degrees at that time.....and do nothing.  Jamie and I have gone to dinner...we have a spending allowance so we are trying to spend as much as we can.....and basically just talk shit on the dumb ass who is training us.  Places like Modesto should be picked up and shoved into states like Oklahoma...they are a disgrace to California.    I don't think I have ever been this excited about the weekends.  Friday night we went bowling.  The only person I beat was my bros girlfriend.  The lane next to us had the worst group of Sonoma hicks I have ever seen.  One guy was even wearing overalls.  That provided me with endless entertainment.  Yesterday was a busy day.  Corrina Joel and I went and helped at the Relay for Life for the American Cancer Society.  Corrinas mom made an incredible luminaria bag for my mom.  We helped to put the luminaries around the track....you would not believe how many there were.  It is sad to see so many lives have been affected by cancer.  Then I went to dinner with Paula and Nole.  They are funny....so old and married.  We then went to see The Terminal.  Tom Hanks did a great job.  I was impressed that it kept me that interested when the whole movie takes place in an airport.  Today it is back to trying to clean up the house and put all my crap away.  We are going to dinner for Fathers Day and then back to hell.  Why do weekends fly by so quickly?

      I think that I am officially going crazy.&nbsp; I just drove home from Joels crying so hard I could not see where I was driving (sounds safe huh).&nbsp; I was basically told at work today by the manager that when I came to the store that they thought I was going to be a "gem" but that I have basically sucked so far.&nbsp; She also wanted advice about the situation from the district manager before even coming to me so now it is officially a "thing."&nbsp; So lucky me I get to deal with tons of drama for who knows how long.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stupid fuckin ghetto bitch tells me that I suck maybe she should make a damn smoothie sometime instead of sitting on her ass all day and&nbsp;pretending to look busy.&nbsp; Maybe she should try working all day everyday on the front line and see how much fun she is having then.&nbsp; I was not what she expected...how about what I expected?...maybe a store that is actually ran by a person who actually works *gasp*....did I just say the "w" word?&nbsp; They all suck and they can kiss my ass.&nbsp; I will just be fake happy that everyone can love and try to pretend that I am not picturing their heads exploding.&nbsp; Other than work crap nothing new.&nbsp; Went to Joels.....watched some tv......vented about hell.....and now time for bed so&nbsp;I can do it all over again.

      I don't really know why I have not been updating this blog but it is probably because I am lazy and I have not set up my computer yet and I am still using my dads.&nbsp; Before my computer was in my room and was super convenient but now I am too lazy to actually go into another room and use it.&nbsp; Plus all I have been doing is working and that is definitely not worth writing about.&nbsp; Joel is home from Europe, which means I am now broke because Joel keeps talking me into going to the casino and spending all my money.&nbsp; I thought moving home was supposed to save me money.&nbsp; Ca'Chet is coming up this weekend.&nbsp; I am taking four days off.&nbsp; I am super excited.&nbsp; I cannot wait to hang out and not have to be in hell for four full days.&nbsp; I worked from 9am-10pm today and now I have to be back there at 5:30am.&nbsp; That place sucks.&nbsp; I work with the BIGGEST bitch ever.&nbsp; I asked her why she was such a bitch....lets just say she was a little taken aback that&nbsp; I asked her that.&nbsp; She was like...who?...me?....a bitch?........I don't mean to be.&nbsp; Whatever stupid fuckin hippy bitch shut the fuck up!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; AAARRRGGGHHH!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell that I am frustrated?&nbsp; Oh wait I am not allowed to be frustrated....I should look at this like a roadblock and take on the challenge while thinking of rainbows and butterflies while I float on happy clouds around the store!&nbsp; I guess in some places teamwork means to be as snotty and bitchy as you can to everyone around you.&nbsp; Time for bed...gotta be back to satans house in a few hours!

      I did not read my last post before I started this one but I am sure I talked about hating work.....well, nothing has changed I still can't stand that place but I am ready to move forward and focus on getting out of there. Now I would like to discuss what else sucks.....people who think that because they are dating someone it means that they no longer have to care what goes in the lives of their friends who were there before the significant other.  I don't understand how some people manage to care about friends and the person they are dating and some other people completely disappear off the face of the earth.  Oh, the best is when they hang out with you for two seconds and feel like they have completed their friend duty.  Anyways people suck.  I am off to the big video game convention in San Jose called California Extreme.  There are just a ton of arcade games set on free play and a convention hall full of video game game geeks.  Sounds like fun to me!  It lasts all day and I do mean all day...from 11am to midnight.  Lots of arcade game playing time.  I guess I should get going.  I don't want to miss out on any free arcade playing.
