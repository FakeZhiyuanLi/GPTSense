         The weather for the next week is supposed to be hot and muggy (just in time for the Celebration of course).  Now, I don't mean to point fingers, but it's been nice up until SOMEONE came back home from Boston yesterday, and now it's supposed to be summerlike again here.  Hmmm....is it just a coincidence?  Not sure, but I have my suspicions on the matter though.  But it's all good because my a/c in my car got fixed just in time for summer temperatures to return (ha!  Jim thought he had outdone me).  Like him (and thousands of others), I am waiting for that winning lottery ticket to cross my path.  Alas, though, it is an elusive little creature.    Speaking of elusive creatures, has anyone heard or seen the Mexican since he got back from Boston?  Probably hibernating somewhere.     I leave for Macomb in 2 weeks or so, THANK GOD!!  I am ready to leave the cultural armpit of the world that is named Decatur.  Although Macomb is not that much better, I at least get my own house (well, half of it anyway).  I love my family to death, but damn are they nosey.  Sometimes I feel like I'm 16 again with the 21 questions of where I'm going, who I'm going with, what time am I going to be back, etc.  Surprised they haven't tagged me with some kind of homing device.  Or maybe they have, I do tend to sleep alot, so it wouldn't be hard.  I'm ready for a vacation from my (summer) vacation.  Only a few more months and then hopefully I'll be sailing to Mexico!  I've got something to look forward to, other than graduation in December.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  A friend of mine last week complained about the hot and humid temperatures (normal for Illinois this time of year) in his blog.&nbsp; He should do that more often because ever since that day we've had gorgeous weather.&nbsp; It's very rare for July/August, so I'm enjoying it as much as possible.&nbsp; I know it can't last forever, so got to make the best of it now.&nbsp; Too bad it can't be like this year-around.&nbsp; But then again I love snow too, so I tend to only like the fall and winter seasons.&nbsp; Only reason I like summer is for vacations and baseball.&nbsp; I spend too much time hanging out with guys.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I've been emailing my roommate from senior year non-stop it seems.&nbsp; We're playing catch-up (told you this was a catch-up summer) because we don't get to talk to each other much.&nbsp; Funny how her dramas are not that dissimilar from mine.&nbsp; Maybe that is why our friendship has lasted so long.&nbsp; Then again my best friend here and I are completely at different ends of the spectrum, and we've been friends even longer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you think about it, why do you stay friends with the people you do?&nbsp; Do you attract people who are just like you or opposite of you?&nbsp; I tend to attract friends nowadays that are neck-deep into politics (not me), love things like rollercoasters and flying (not me), and/or other things that I won't mention (but aren't me either).&nbsp; Yet I love them to death, and would do anything for them - as I do and would for those I've known for pretty much all my life.&nbsp; I do know that&nbsp;all my friends&nbsp;are caring people who bust their butts for their friends, are trustworthy, &nbsp;and would be there when you need them.&nbsp; Those things are the qualities I look for in friends - those are what really&nbsp;count&nbsp;in the end.&nbsp;

        Well, most of you know that most of my family still lives in England.&nbsp; One of my friends (well actually most of them from school) love to give me grief about the incredibly dry sense of humor of the British.&nbsp; However, my little story below sounds more like something that my friends would try to do.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousin in England was getting married.&nbsp; At the beginning of the reception afterward, he friend handed keys out to about 20-30 females and 3 guys (this is all without my cousins knowledge).&nbsp; When it came to the part where he was supposed to give a speech about the newlyweds, he said that since my cousin was married now, all his 'girlfriends' had to turn in their keys to his house.&nbsp; So one by one these girls came up to the front and turned in their key in front of the married couple.&nbsp; At the end, the guys came up to.&nbsp; His bride didn't know what to think, probably something along the lines of, &nbsp;"what have I gotten myself into?"&nbsp; Too bad I couldn't have been there at the wedding though...     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well more stuff later

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Since people have been buggin me about my blog, I thought I'd go ahead and update you all.&nbsp; Nothing exciting has been going on really to report - just spending time with a few friends.&nbsp; I STILL don't have my car, that will hopefully be ready by the middle of next week.&nbsp; Just hope its not being used by a bunch of shop students somewhere as an experiment.&nbsp; You know, where they take the car entirely apart and then put back together to see if they did it right.&nbsp; But I think that is what my mechanics have done to it anyway, so maybe students would do a better job and get my a/c working again.&nbsp; Out here in the hot & humid cornfields of Illinois, you really do need air.&nbsp; And out of self-protection in my hometown, going over the bridge so you don't pass out from trying to hold your breath too long.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the Relay 4 Life out at the community college.&nbsp; I'll probably be out there for the fireworks, walk, and talk to a few people.&nbsp; I try to go to that every year, but I missed both of them last year (one here and one at school).&nbsp; I usually have a luminary out for my cousin who passed away of cancer back when I was in high school; maybe they will still let me put one out.&nbsp; They do have an absolutely perfect night for it for once.&nbsp; (This day has been gorgeous, 73 degrees and sunny, with a slight breeze.)&nbsp; As soon as that is over then it's over to the hospital to pick my mother up from work.&nbsp; At least she lets me use the car, I just play taxi.&nbsp; But its a fair trade.&nbsp; Well hopefully I or&nbsp;the "Boston dweller"&nbsp;will be millionaires by the end of the night.&nbsp; I won $35 gambling earlier this week, so maybe I'll be lucky and my streak&nbsp;might just&nbsp;continue!

         I went to breakfast with my mom today: a rare occurence since I'm never up before noon during the summer usually.  I realized then that I won't get to do that very often soon since I won't be coming back here after college (no matter what happens).  It made me sad because I know I won't get to see my family as much.  Decatur - I can leave with no problems.  But I will miss my family and the few friends I have left here.     I've been to some of the most wonderful places in the world: New York City, London, Munich, Paris, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando, Philadelphia, etc.  I've gone to places that are 100's if not 1000's of years old, met people from all over the world, been to 8 different countries and 25 states.  I've been on the snow-capped mountains, in huge fields of flowers, swimming in the Caribbean, places where there are waterfalls all around you, cave diving in some of the largest caves in the country, kickin it with friends in Disney World for over a week, and standing in the middle of Times Square. I've stood where monarchs, politcians, famous composers, inventors, and even ancient Romans have been.  After seeing all that, you can see why I won't miss Decatur at all.  Maybe this explains why I'm easily bored though sometimes.    But I am by no means done travelling.  One of my friends told me that this was probably the happiest they had ever seen me, when I'm travelling.  Guess its no secret that I'm not a person to stay put.  There are so many places I still want to go and see: California, Alaska, Australia, Italy, Greece, the pyramids of Egypt, New Zealand, western Mexico, Spain, the Virgin Islands.  Hopefully I'll get to see it all someday.  And I can't wait till the day I can go back to London - not only to see my family, but to actually appreciate the things I see this time.  It truly is one of my most favorite places (if not the most) to visit that I have ever been to.

          Do you ever get the feeling that you shouldn't have gone out one day, and should have just stayed home where it's safe?  That was my day today.  I'm on my way to WalMart, someone pulls out in front of me while I'm going 45.  Near miss.  I'm closer to WalMart someone runs a red light.  Near miss for me, not the person behind me.  Get to the parking lot of store and this time I'm not so lucky.  You'd think that someone would notice a red fire engine colored Pontiac Grand AM - guess not.  The lady saw me waiting for a spot, gets in her van, and either forgot that I was there or thought she could clear it but she smacked right into my drivers side.  I was almost in tears because she hit me fairly hard.  That's all I need, higher car insurance.  Damn Decatur drivers.  I'm just about to get my car fixed tomorrow and someone hits it!  More money I don't have.     This summer has been more of a get in touch with old friends type summer.  I've been hanging out with Dara a lot.  I've been talking to Sharon, and my old roommate and one of my bestest friends ever, Randi.  I have a lot of friends, and I love them all to death, but Randi has been there for me through probably the roughest times I've had in my life.  She's been the grounded, reasoning person to my sometimes irratic and dramatic life changes.  Her and I met the very first day we moved into Western as we lived on the same floor (THOMPSON 11!!).  We found ourselves in the same English class as well as another friend of ours.  We quickly became best friends.  I remember staying up till early hours of the morning with us (and sometimes Nicole &  Sara) in the hallway or the floor lounge just talking.  Or playing that damned card game (sex in the elevator anyone??)    I really miss her and sometimes I find myself even missing her irritatingly perfect logic.  She knows WAY TOO MUCH about me too; hope she never uses it as blackmail.  She knows about all the bad roommate issues, good and bad (and weird) relationships I've been in, my whole saga of the high school years.  Anyhow, I'm hoping to get down to St. Louis before the summer is out to visit her.

          Sometimes I think God puts some irony in our lives for amusement.  Take yesterday for example.  I had went to a store to get some stuff and then head over to a friends house for the evening.  I run into an old friend of mine that I had known almost all my life.  We had liked each other at one point but never did get together because we thought we were so different that it wouldn't work.  Turns out we ended up a lot alike.  Both have degrees in Psychology in which we are not happy with so he's going to go get another degree.  He's only here for the summer 'cause he can't stand this city either.  There were a bunch of things, but you get the basic idea.  We both found it funny that we had almost too much in common now.  We talked for over an hour.  We said our goodbyes and that was it - just never know when irony will pop up.     I was at my friends house for the day.  We were trying to create something - no luck so far though, so I gotta go back today and see if we can do it.  Its supposed to be a surprise so I can't tell you all what it is yet, but her and I at least are having fun working on this project.  I got to talk to her cousin who was also one of my best friends in high school.  I hadn't talked to her or seen her since a year after I graduated from there.  She lives in Virginia now - her cousin here (my friend who I hang out with here) is going there to visit her and go to a wedding of yet another one of our friends in August.  I wanted to go, but I'll be moving into WIU that week.     My beautiful Pontiac Grand AM gets fixed tomorrow, so I can use it again.  Although I like my mom's new car (which I feel like is my home now after all the driving I've done in the last week), I miss mine and I can't wait to have it back!  Fun times in the "pimpmobile" (courtesy of my friend Courtney).  I really miss the 'old group' I used to hang out with before we all graduated.  Love you guys and hope to see you soon!

         As I was driving back home today, I passed my old junior high.  I was sad to see that they had already torn half of it down, the gymnasium, science hallways, the music rooms, and the industrial tech rooms.  Supposedly there is a Target store going in there in the future.  Unfortunetely our school board feels that money is more important than education, and they use their positions for their own personal gain.  I have lost faith in a lot of people and "politicians" in this city.  Thats sad because these are the people we are supposed to rely on for help, they are elected to represent what is best for the citizens.  I don't think they have yet.  But it is no wonder that the school system here is one of the worst in the state.  Just another reason I won't be coming back here after I'm done with college...

         I just got back from Joliet - it was a good weekend.  Friday, Augy and I went to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in Naperville.  After that we went to his friends bar because it was his birthday.  We didn't get back till late, but it was good times.  Saturday we took his mom and his aunt to a Cubs game at Wrigley Field.  We dropped them off and then went to this little hotdog stand that we went to last year on one of my first trips that he took me to Chicago.  Then during the game we wondered around Wrigleyville.  Afterwards we went to a Mexican restaurant with them.  By this time I was tired so I decided that driving back late wouldn't be the best thing.  I left there the same time his brother was taking him to the airport to head for Boston this morning.  I know he'll be busy, but will have a great time out there at the Convention.  This is what he wants to do with his life and why he's going to school since Politics is his major.  But I admit, I'm going to really miss him and can't wait till he gets back.    I briefly thought about stopping in Bloomington on my way back home since there is a MIG meeting at Illinois Wesleyan.  But, I was passing by way too early and am still tired from the weekend, so I decided to just head home.  I've logged about 2000 miles in one week.  And I'm sure within the next week or two I'll be on the road again since I like to roadtrip so much.  :-)

         Well, I'm back in Illinois.  The trip was good, although the drive was very very long.  But it was worth it.  Besides I love road trips.  You never know what you're going to see while you drive.  And even when I'm bored I can find things to easily amuse myself.  One thing was to see how many different state license plates I could find along our route.  38 states represented along the route from Decatur to Texarkana...  Another thing I do sing obnoxiously loud to cds and stuff.  See even 12 hour drives can be fun!     I've got stuff to do in the next couple of days.  Tomorrow is laundry and errand day (again).  Friday I leave for Joliet to see Augy before he leaves for Boston.  We're going to his friends bar that night to spend time with his friends and his cousin (I'm guessing).  I head back Saturday, and hopefully Sunday I'll be meeting my old high school friend Sharon for lunch.  It's been a long time since we've spent any time together, not since the days of high school.  That seems like a lifetime ago now.  It'll be fun to catch up!  :-)

         Today is my last day in Texas.  I'll be heading back to civilization early tomorrow morning.  It's not been a bad trip although I've felt better.  Only one day in D-town and then I'm Joliet-bound to see Augy before he leaves for Boston for 2 weeks.  I think he's nervous about flying - I've flown plenty of times and I still get nervous.  But I also think anyone in their right mind is a little nervous before any flight, even if they have flown a hundred times.  I'm happy for him that he gets to go experience the DNC.  But I have to find something to entertain myself for 2 weeks while he's there (no 2 am phone calls, blah).  I'm sure my friend Dara will cook something up for me!  Augy better bring me back something from Boston (well as long as that something does not have to do with the Red Sox!).    I used to love summer breaks till I got to college.  Now I just rather stay in school.  Sounds sick doesn't it?  Well, considering what I do during the school year (least of which is studying), maybe its not so farfetched afterall.   I spend most of my time in meetings, "union dwelling"/office hours,  spending time with friends outside university grounds, classes when I go, and studying in that order.  I love easy majors!  I don't want to enter the real workforce yet; maybe I should get a third bachelors in Law Enforcement or RPTA?  Nah...

          Well, I'm in Texas for a few days visiting family.  Actually I'm out in the boonies, but I have found ways of entertaining myself (playing with the dog, doing stuff online, using my minicam, etc).  I think I'm just easily amused.  Since I've been down here though, I've been sorta working on stuff for Model Illinois Government.  Mainly I've just been coming up with ideas and such, but that is nothing new.  I'm always calling the Speaker or emailing him new ideas of mine.  I don't like the politics as much as I think I like social reforms.  Or at least that sounded halfway smart.     I am ready to go back to school - it should be an interesting semester.  And I do say semester since I graduate in December (woohoo!). I better find a job soon though or come January, I'm going to be a homeless bum!!  I better find something with two bachelors degrees, didn't spend all that money for nothing.  I'm not going to worry about it though now, I'm just going to enjoy my last semester as a student ever (well for a while at least...).  Another wave of senioritis is coming,  I can feel it.

       It seems that for the first time ever I'll have to move myself into a new place instead of having the usual "moving crew."  This should be fun, a learning experience in itself.  My family can't get the time off for when I'm supposed to move, so now I can only pack what my car can hold and send for the rest later.  As I said, it should be fun.      So, I have errands to do up until the time I leave.  I never really unpacked when I came home for the summer, so I don't have that much packing to do.  But I have to go get some stuff and get some things done before I return to school.  Not that I mind, it lets me get out of the house.  I'm one of these that if I'm bored, I like to go out for a drive or something.  Plus I probably won't be back this way for awhile.      I have to get back into the mindset where papers, exams, projects, and meetings are an everyday occurence.  After such a long summer, that's easier said than done.  I don't have to worry about a heavy classload, but then again a lot of classes has never really bothered me.  It's all the meetings that I subject myself to because I choose to be in all of them and then halfway through the semester I'm sick of them.  This semester I'm going to try something a little different - besides it's my last time in Macomb, I want to enjoy it and not be living in the Union.  There are some things I almost regret getting into.  But, as always when it comes to activities and such, I'll try to make the best of it.      -------    The supreme happiness of life is the conviction of being loved for yourself, or more correctly, being loved in spite of yourself. - Victor Hugo      Who you are today is a product of what you did yesterday.

       Well, I am in Decatur till Friday, then it's to Macomb I go.  I'll be honest, I'm nervous about moving back since there are so many new things for me to handle this semester.  I graduate mid-year so I have to find a job OFF-CAMPUS once I graduate.  I'm living in a house this year instead of a dorm room (excuse me, residence halls - apologies to those of UHDS and Crayola Congress lol) or in an apartment.  And once again I have a roommate after having my own space for a year.  Well, most of the time.        I'm 1 for 2 in the roommate department.  My first roommate from my freshman year was a lunatic.  My roommate that I had my senior year was one of my best friends.  We had our little tiffs once in a great while (I think once or twice actually which is pretty damn good for a year of living together), but overall that was a lot of fun.  So, all of these put together will make it an interesting year for me.  However, I do know that this year will be my last in Macomb (sniff sniff).  Six years is a long time, one quarter of my life has been spent there.  I have to admit, I've loved my time there, and I have been through some big, life-changing events.  But alas, I am being called to another place.  I will (for    the most part) have fond memories of my time there though.      My car had only been home a week when something else went wrong with it.  But I got it back in a couple of hours, so it wasn't a big thing after all, which I am thankful.  Hopefully it will stay together for awhile now.  I love that car, but I think it's real color is yellow.  One day I'll be able to afford a new car.  You know, after earning my 4 bachelor and 2 master degrees.  ;-)      Shout outs to a couple of people - hopefully a congrats is in order for Jason.  You can tell Augy that you are his master now with that new degree.  To James, whatever you are doing with the weather, keep on doing it!!  Oh, and I want to read what you have done in regards to the novel too.    I've decided to start closing my entries with a couple of quotes that I try to live by.        --------    ~"No love, no friendship can cross the path of our destiny without leaving some mark on it forever."    (Francois Mauriac)    ~"Happiness is not something you experience, it's something you remember."   (Oscar Levant)      ~"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within."  (Oliver Wendell Holmes)

           Nine days till I move back to Macomb.  I'm ready to go back, and at the same time I know that my days as a second bachelors candidate will be coming to a close in a blink of an eye.  It'll be a bittersweet semester for me, becuase I do know that this is most likely my last semester as a WIU student.  I'm debating whether to go ahead and walk at the graduation or not.   You have to remember, I've already done this once.  I think it had to be one of the proudest moments of my life too.  I had went through a lot to get to that point.  To all those who will graduate this year, a couple of words of advice for you - enjoy your senior year and make the best of it while it lasts, because it goes by quick!  A lot of people I knew thought it would just be like graduating from high school. Believe me, it means so much more to go walk across this stage and get that ($40000) slip of paper this time around than it did in high school.  Usually its not only because of the hard work that people put into studies (or partying), but its also surviving a drama-filled 4 years that sometimes comes with college life.         Today was shopping day.  I decided to go get my school supplies now instead of waiting till I got to Macomb and having to deal with literally thousands of people at the same time.  I love busy shopping seasons (especially Christmas), but not when it comes to school.  I remember when I was little I used to love going back to school.  Then the high school years I hated it.  Now I'm all up for it again.  Strange how things work sometimes isn't it?
