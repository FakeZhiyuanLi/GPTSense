      Had a mongo fight with the BF today. I loathe attempting to even elaborate on it, but suffice it to say I was uninvited for dinner tonight and I do believe I will be sleeping in tomorrow. An odd way to get what I wanted in the first place. Oh happy day. I'd write more in my angry rage but that would not be polite, and apparently that does not make me a fun person to be around.   today was the big vet visit for Gord, getting out, seeing the world, that crazy hedgehog. The vet loved him and he's in great health. How weird that I felt proud that she gushed of my hedgehog, like I have anything to do with his cuteness. Anyway, I'd saw it was a success.  I saw 'monster' today and I felt a bit disturbed afterwards. charlize theron was surprisingly good. What got to me though is that the film adds a totally moralistic device at the end to remind people that she is a monster, like they were afraid she may be too sympathetic at that point. It always makes me wonder, and I found the discussion of circumstances pretty interesting.

      Can't explain why but I am highly annoyed with just about everything today. I just found out I am in for another 3-4 month stint at work of serious overtime and little appreciation. Last summer was 16 weeks of 6 days a week of work with overtime, I am not too pleased about doing a second round. Its interesting to be told from the start we have deadlines we can't meet, usually they save that for midway through to trick us into working overtime to make up the difference. I think it's a bad sign.  my teeth are really sensitive today. Its day 4 of the whitestrip test, I am concerned I will have to drop it if my teeth get much more tingly. But they are really getting white! Darn...  day two of the diet. I had a hunger headache yesterday. Already! I am so in my own head about it. Anyway, its going to be tough, my family is sometimes my biggest obstacle. They take it as a personal affront when I diet, like somehow they are living through it themselves, and they hate it. They complain and they bring it up in 20 minute intervals. I regret telling them already. I just figure if i tell people i will be more likely to keep up with it. (and i checked this morning, i'm 2 pounds lighter, woohoo!)  tomorrow is Gord's first vet appointment, I know it will be an adventure. Taking a hedgehog to the vet is not something I thought I'd ever do, but I find everything about Gord funny. how pissy, compulsive and obsessive he is. reminds me of me (I guess that seems obvious) I really hope he 'un-balls' so the vet can look at him, it would suck if he needed to be knocked out or something. he's not exactly a satisfying pet, but i enjoy his consistant personality.   going to see a concert tonight, the artist is Chris Whitely. He's good, not amazing, but good. and since its a cheap one, I decided getting out of the house is a good idea. tomorrow its vet time, and a birthday dinner for my BF with his friends. sunday is like family catch up day, breakfast with glen's folks, a movie with my brother and then dinner at my folks. um...is it mean or pathetic to say I can't wait until I have homework to do? too many people, what ever happened to sleep?   my therapist says that i am an introvert. here and now i declare i am starting a introvert club. i nominate me to be the member (naturally, total membership is limited to 1). activities include sitting alone in public places, cooking, reading and attending university classes where you don't talk to a soul. it is required to feel isolated from 98% of all individuals and to take some hidden enjoyment from it. guilt is a necessary emotional response for not socializing as others do, and it is essential that you feel anxious at every gathering with more than 3 people. monthy fees yet to be established. i think i will nominate myself to write the newsletter...  today I really need a cigarette. And some alone time with some mcCrap...

      ...especially with your therapist. he has responded with:   It is completely your decision whether or not to continue therapy.  However, I would like you to consider coming for another session, to discuss therapy, in general, and your decision to continue or not.  I think that such a decision would have been best talked about in our sessions.  I know you were seeking help, and presume there might still be a need for some, so I guess you're stopping because you have lost hope that we can solve the "problem". I would like you to consider meeting to have a look at what happened.   um, no. no, no, no. not interested. if i have a "problem" and not a problem, i don't want his "advice" or "help". grumble....

      My therapist actually emailed me today to see when I would make my next appointment. Why can't I just disappear quietly without having to address it? That's the way I like to do things, but alas, I had to send a reply and say I'd like to discontinue our sessions. We're breaking up. He was too distant and unemotional. And I didn't like the condescending way he talked to his receptionist...Something about it told me he wasn't a compassionate guy. Am I deflecting because I still can't address the issues I went to him for in the first place? Maybe, maybe not. But shit, he gave me no feedback at all, NONE. He doesn't deserve a breakup in person, an email will do.  and even bigger news...I started my diet. Today's menu: a special K bar and pineapple for breakfast, a low fat frozen lunch and celery for lunch, a low fat muffin and coffee for a snack, and dinner remains to be seen. Drinking lots of water. I have 8 out of 18 points left if I follow this thing religiously, but I still haven't decided how I will approach this. If I am more realistic this time and don't starve myself, it will be a slower weight loss. Anyway, today's weigh in: 144.8 POW! Biggest I've ever been. I have yet another wedding in October and I will be skinny  I had a nightmare about my hedgehog Gord again. I keep reading this hedgehog discussion site and they are great people but sometimes the info can really scare you, they can be fearmongers. Anyway, its the second time I've had a dream that Gord was dying slowly and I couldn't save him because I couldn't operate a phone to call a doctor. My BF says the dream is about me and not Gord. Maybe I should keep my therapists email.  as for Gord, take a look:  http://www.chins-n-quills.com/forums/gallery.php?do=show&userid=6764

      today i am sporting slightly whiter teeth, contact lenses rather than my usual glasses and new lipstick and nail polish from clinique. most likly not noticable at all, but i'm feeling dandy. one of the big bosses are in town this week so everyone at work is in dress up fancy mode, and i've been feeling pretty stylish. today i have on cute little black mules, a fishnet type stocking, and a black dress with a charcoal jacket. i feel both sharp and a fraud at the same time.  In an effort to reinvent myself in small, socially acceptable doses, I decided to give those whitestipes for your teeth a try. I bought them yesterday and had to try them right away. Maybe I'm a total sucker, but I already think there is a difference in the colour of my teeth. I decided to use the strips on both the upper and lower teeth at the same time while I was cleaning out my dresser drawers and when I bent down to pick something up, I drooled all over the place. Seems I forget to swallow when I have plastic wrappers on my teeth...It wasn't my prettiest moment. I am making a conscious effort to curb my tea/coffee/coke/red wine intake, but to be honest, if I plan to get going with this diet I keep mentioning, coffee and tea will allow me to survive. What a conundrum!  tonight after dinner at my folks (a weekly ritual) I will make a trip to the super duper grocery store and get all those diet friendly items that I need: perrier, fruit and veggies, frozen dinners, scallops, bran everything. I am returning to a diet I've done before and I know it will work. The WW diet (am I allowed to write their name down without being sued? It seems everyone on the net that mentions them gets blasted). The only reason it failed last time is, after losing 23 or more pounds, xmas came along and I always had some excuse to eat decadently. Two months later I was still making excuses. I was weak willed. I was also way too regimented the first time. I made no exceptions, lost tons of weight but it was a lifestyle I couldn't keep up...I was miserable. After all, I love food. L-O-V-E love food.   I was a finicky eater until I was almost 16 and then through the friends and boyfriends in my life I discovered that there are so many yummy things out there. Salmon, scallops, cheese, Indian food, etheopian, Thai, etc. A conincidence that I went from 110 pounds to 144 during the same time I discovered food? I think not. But not I must learn to love food in moderation (and give up the mcCrap). I'm stressed just thinking about it.  a comment about work: I'm in between projects now, and I have nothing to do. I'm in one of those situations where I have to look like I am busy even though we all know I am not. It's silly. Also, I am a technical team lead, and yesterday one of my team was 'promoted' to being the system analyst on my future projects. I don't know how I feel about this at all. My team has shrunk, and this guy will now try to usurp my environments because he has had free access to them before as a developer. I predict confrontation in the near future. I wish I could care a little less, or get more nonchalant about it. Its just not in my nature to be laidback. yay type A!

      Why can't they make boots in sizes for all women? Sure, I fit in a size 7, but the zipper only goes up halfway up my leg. I'm sure this gives an image of monstrous calves but really, my legs are not that big!   My boot shopping experience over lunch was emotionally scarring. First I asked to try on a black and a tan pair (different styles), so the salesjerk picks a pair up and puts the other down. I had to do charades in order to give her the idea I wanted to try on BOTH. Then when I couldn't zip them up she thought I needed a lesson in using a zipper. Oh the fury! Explaining to her they didn't fit my leg wasn't enough, she wanted to assure me that they had a section of stretchy elastic. Ok, I get it! No sexy boots for chicks with big legs. I wanted to bitch slap her with the boot before I exited but, well, decorum and law prevented me. I will fantasize at my desk instead.  so on that note, I will sign off with a list, because I am both anal retentive and highly agitated.  things that annoy me lately:  1. The guy in the cube beside me. Offensive to every single one of my senses 2. The way my glasses fog up in the winter when I get indoors 3. The psychological battle between my boss and I 4. The way my hedgehog insists on defecating when I'm holding him 5. That my therapist has defined me as HSP, highly senstive person. It's an actual condition that even I can't take seriously.

      I had a dream last night that I was geena davis. It was a strangely erotic dream, especially to be in a very tall, volumptuous body (I am not so tall or volumptuous myself). i'd have to add her to my 'if I was ever going to be a lesbian' imaginary list. I guess this is especially odd because I was in fact, her in the dream. (maybe its a dream about self love! heheh...) anyway, I must see a geena davis movie soon, it would somehow add closure to my dream. sounds weird, but I am so affected by my dreams in a Freudian way. they are always very vibrant and detail laden. And they are also rich with my neurotic issues de jour. my BF says my dreams are blatant in their messages, funny...I think it takes an outsider to see that because he often fits it all together before I do. anyway, i'll have to give him all the details so he can spell it out for me.....and if he says I secretly want my body to be tall and volumptous, I will kick him.  I had some mcCrap for breakfast. i'm going all out to ingest the shitty food I love before my diet. had pizza for dinner last night too. but today's lunch: my very own spaghetti, homemade with a machine and my own bolognese sauce. i'm quite content with myself, I don't exactly come from a haute cuisine background. to be fair, i'm also my worst critic when it comes to my cooking. but my BF always makes me feel like a superstar in the kitchen, and it wouldn't be much fun at all to cook for myself alone, so i'm glad to cook for us.   It sounds like a bit of a throwback but know this; I am a feminist, and I like to cook. its not an oxymoron, and I won't even explain it as being post modern feminist - it simply is. the fact is, I believe feminism is about having or fighting for the freedom to do what you want without superficial boundaries like sex (or race, ethnicity, etc). I am unabashedly a feminist, much to my mother's chagrin. I realize it's a huge topic to get into, and i'm not writing an essay here to explain my views on feminism post second wave, but I do think people need to stop taking the piss out of the term feminism. i'm always astounded at how many of my righteous gal friends think they are not feminists, and  absolutely mystified by the boys I know that shiver in their boots at a mere mention of the word.   I think i've been on too many discussion boards, i'm automatically going on the defensive with no prompting whatsoever and providing reasons for my thoughts....as if people are reading this anyhow. besides (I rationalize to myself) can't this be the forum where I don't have to feel so defensive all the time?

      I have nothing to do. I have visited every one of my favourite sites three times each.   I am fantasizing about a mcChicken and feeling guilty about just wanting mcEvil. For the folks that are now defending mcdonalds as a backlash to the current popular dislike of the chain, I'm allowed to feel that way, I worked there for 2 years so I've earned my disdain. Yet, I still crave it regularly. I don't crave regular junk food like chips of candy bars, I need food injected with grease to fill my needs. poutines, burgers, hot dogs, all that questionable stuff. and it never goes away. I crave cigarettes less, if you can imagine that coming from an ex-smoker. my absolute favourite? the Italian poutine: greasy fries topped with cheese curd and a tomato meat sauce. I am drooling just writing this. how can I get one of those today? I feel a sense of urgency to ingest one prior to the 'diet'...and the inevitable stomach pain that follows it. it is a self abusive ritual that confounds my BF to no end. yummmm....  I wonder...if I have finally taken to writing a blog, that must mean its past its 'guaranteed fresh before' date. I guess the funny part of my choosing to write one is the timing. I just stopped seeing my therapist (details for another time) and this will now be my surrogate forum for my irrational tantrums. Joy. Oh well, no painful repercussions this way, no sensitive ears to offend (or maybe so, but who cares).  tonight's agenda: my university course, followed by watching a bit of couples fear factor on tv with the BF. Hopefully some grease bomb food added to that and some play time with my hedgehog (no that is not a euphemism..). Nice and routine, like it or not.

      i haven't even started my new diet yet and i've already got those familiar hunger pangs for some kind of processed food. its in the works for later this week after i get some diet friendly groceries and eat all my yummy valentine's day treats that my sweetie gave me.  been there, done that, lost 25 pounds. but, hehe, i've gained it all back (well earned pounds, i might add) and i have to start all over again. why? not sure. a bit of narcissism i guess. i could say its for health, but its mostly about my ass. ah... the truth. regardless of how uninteresting this part of my life is, i do intend on tracking my progress here. and if i don't, i can have a written record of how i wimped out of losing weight because i love processed food so much. added pressure helps motivate me. i'm a simple animal.

      i always thought that given the opportunity i would have tons to say in a forum like this. oddly, i am without inspiration. my life use to be about drama and fun, but in the last couple years i can't say i recognize much of that. that's why i started my first entry in November and here I am at attempt numero deux a couple months later. perhaps i can come up with something worthy to write about, i just wish i didn't feel like i was reaching.  i just finished reading all the entries in one girls blog, it was better than most long running HBO shows. i can't get over how different things are for her, i think perhaps i lead too boring a life for a gal my age. maybe time for a change? when i was 16 and angry with things, a good dose of hair dye and a piercing or tattoo made me feel better. now i don't want to pierce because i would like to give blood and i don't dye because i figure i should enjoy my natural colour before i go completely grey. i am feeling restless though....

      - Richard hatch's comment as he was voted out.  I know, its a TV show, but I will miss him, he was highly entertaining. Despite everyone saying they are bored with survivor, I'm as interested as I've always been. My favourite hour of tv, by far.  the haircut went well, not anything drastic, but he managed to merge my growing bangs into the rest of my hair pretty seamlessly. And the woman that did my eyebrows managed to really perfect them without changing the way they look. Add to that a student discount and a double espresso and I am pleased.  I'm feeling rather content today. it is friday, and the BF and I are being affectionate. its a good feeling. great, in fact. if it could be like this regularly it wouldn't matter how much work sucked.   note to self: worry less about my principles and a little more about what makes me happy  and now for something frivolous, some of my top favourite websites:  1. the best recipe site ever, every one I've tried is a culinary triumph! http://www.epicurious.com/  2. all the news you need to know about all that is survivor. I can waste plenty of time on that one http://www.survivorfever.net/  3. because I an anal retentive about my finances http://www.royalbank.com/  4. for a dose of some feminist articles. http://www.bitchmagazine.com/  5. very good reading, I am as addicted to this as I am survivor http://smitten.typepad.com/smitten/  after seeing this list, I've decided I need new web reading. please, some suggestions!

      .... wing wang walla bing bang, ooh eee ooh ah ah wing wang walla walla bing bang...  wow, that was satisfying. it was an itch that needed to be scratched.  just finished driving a development meeting, I am having a brief moment of pride in my work. Sometimes I feel pretty competent.   so hungy. I forgot the 'R', but I thought hungy looked cute enough to leave there. Maybe I'll eat that banana that's on my desk that I've been avoiding. My hedgehog has avoided all my tricks to get him to eat banana, so maybe there's a good reason not to eat them. How gross that he prefers worms. I have taken to calling him 'mee mee' in this rather annoying voice. I can't even say what prompted it, its just a sound he responses to a touch better than the kissy noises I was making at him before...That actually seemed to piss him off.  one more hour and I'm off to get my hair coiffed. Its really relaxing these days, the head massage, shampoo, espresso, etc. its still not worth the price, but I'll take all the extras if they are giving them. If the BF would rub my scalp more often, I swear I wouldn't ever need to search for massages elsewhere.   so the pasta e fagioli was pretty decent, a recipe to put in the success file. The Portuguese scallops I made earlier this week really sucked, I was pretty disappointed. All the ingredients sounded right but the combination was lacking. Anyway, for tonight, I do believe its a lazy no cook night for me so, either a veg pizza or some processed crap laying around the house. ahhhh...Processed food...yum.

      Today is Thursday, which means its weigh in after my first week of the diet. This week's weight loss: 4.6 pounds.  I'm pretty impressed, almost 5 pounds in the first week suits me just fine. I know the weight loss tapers off over the weeks but it's a good start. I haven't decided on my goal weight, probably 125, so another 15 pounds to go...  I'm psyched to get my hair cut tonight, I need a change, even if it will be a minor one.  still waiting for my job review, I'm getting nervous that my boss will forget, and I have already reminded him 3 times and now I know it would be pushing it to remind him again.  I am feeling pretty stressed even though there is nothing immediate in my life to worry about. Its mostly got to do with both projects starting at work, combined with the workload of my classes (I have some exams and papers coming up), trying to see family, and trying to see some friends that I have been missing. I may be busy but it doesn't mean I'm not bored. My routine is killing me, and I've fenced myself in with bad weather, family obligations and work expectations. I am dying to get on my bike and ride around alone or see some of my friends again. Problem is, my initiative is not nearly as strong as my desire.  add to that the hurricane that is my relationship with my BF and I guess the stress makes sense. I got lambasted for my weekend fight update on my blog, so against better judgment I am once again writing about that private stuff I'm not suppose to. Fact is, we cannot get along. My fault? His fault? ... what does it matter? I wish this stuff could be fixed but I have doubts that you can come back from such a long fall. And we're both pretty bitter. This fight has been fought so many times before. Our theme: Sysiphus.

      I received an email from the IS department today warning about a new virus and when I checked my web email this afternoon, low and behold, an offensive virus email was waiting for me. I was quite pleased that I averted disaster. I worry that if something like that every happened, it would be obvious to all that my surfing/email use is the cause. I can't help but surf/email at least a few minutes a day. I guess its like guys and internet porn, if its just there all the time, they feel a duty to use it, it would be 'wasted porn' otherwise, and OMG, we can't have porn going unused. Can I compare it to the 'if a tree falls in the forest'? If naked pictures of women are not masturbated to, are they still pornography? hmmm....  I'm suppose to have my yearly evaluation sometime between today and Friday. I better get me a good review, I really deserve it. My whole summer was shot. Although its all for naught, because they haven't given out raises in over 2 years due to financial issues. Still, any evaluation I get makes me anxious, I need to do well or I get cranky.  tonight's new recipe that I will try: pasta e fagioli.  pretty basic, but I've only recently started eating beans that are not green beans, so it's new to me.  oh, and that massage I had yesterday...it was killer. my buddy has got the strongest hands ever...I've got to think up a new nickname for her...I'll have to think about it for a bit...

      I am aching for something bad to eat. I went downstairs from work to get a coffee and the display of snack cakes beckoned me from afar. Pink fluff, white fluffy cream filling, gooey caramel, argh... (insert drool here) I need to get this addiction under control. Its not even that I am obese now, I'm actually in the right weight range for my age/height. Its just that every year I seem to add just a pound or two. Not too noticeable on a daily basis, but god damn, I've got photos! I know what I use to look like. That double chin I use to only have when I made a 'face', well, its more common than I'd like to admit. If I can just learn to wean off of the stuff I can eventually introduce it back in teeny tiny quantities.  today I applied my last whitestrip. I was more impressed at first. I can't stay away from tea/coffee so I think I certainly affected some of its magic right off the bat. second, my teeth have been uber sensitive for 3 days now. oh well,  it was an interesting experiment. I especially liked wearing it on the bus on the way to work and knowing people were looking at my teeth, appalled.   I'm going to have a massage tonight. tee hee, I love being pampered. I am a girl that likes my personal space and shrinks away from people touching me, but the anonymous massage, ...LOVE it. And the fact that insurance pays...Oh yeah LOVE it.  I think today's entry needs a list. Mundane things that I find satisfying:  1. Tweezing a hair with its bulb still attached 2. Getting a big piece of gunk out of my teeth when I floss 3. Making a trip to the office supply closet (nearly orgasmic...I love office supplies) 4. Turning on the food channel and 30 minute meals is on 5. Seeing that my bicycle is still locked in my garage when I go check on it

      I had to take action, I am on the brink of insanity. Its in my eyes, on my face, full of static...The hair I am trying desperately to grow is tormenting me. I've resorted to barrettes, I look 12 years old. So Thursday I have an appointment with my hair man to do something about it. I'd like to think drastic, but I've always been a wimp when it comes to hair. A girl has got to know what assets not to mess with. But I hope he can do something to stop the insanity. Oh! And I'm getting my eyebrows tamed too. I have decent eyebrows, clean and all, but a bit too Brooke shields. I want something a bit more sleek. I'm gonna cross my fingers, I am petrified that I will end up with a pencil line for an eyebrow.  today I am starting work on the two new projects I will head as technical team lead. I am a bit excited, it feels good to be working on something and feel productive. The bad part is that I know it will require a chunk of my personal time, and I don't have much to give as the semester gets closer to mid terms, papers and final exams. I expect a load of homework and since the 2 classes I am taking are year long deals, its twice as important that I do well...Twice as many credits and my GPA is counting on it.   I have one class that is tough but worthwhile, and so far I feel I have earned the grades I've received. The other class is atrocious, the teacher is a numbnut. She gave me a god damn B on my last exam, that is going to kill my average. Perhaps I have waited to long, but I am considering contesting a couple makes on that last exam, her questions are a bit to subjective for her to have given me less points. What to do, what to do?  its mid term break this week, I have no classes, only full time work, woo hoo... What a load off my chest! (that's dripping with sarcasm in case its not apparent...)  still working at this diet. According to the super electronic scale, I have lost 2 pounds. Since I plan to use a weekly weigh in to track my progress (on Thursdays) I guess I better not jump the gun, I could gain it back by then.   i am trying to muster up all my willpower not to look at the survivor spoilers on the internet. apparently the order of eviction is all over the net, and it has been right 4 out of 4 times. i am curious but i'd hate to ruin the show, i absolutely absorb the 1 hour show every week.

      From what I understand, there is absolute chaos at my workplace today. Rather than dwell on it, because it will be facing me on monday, I will write about completely irrelevant things.  tonight's menu: sesame chicken some kind of side dish with zucchini in it  I feel like trying a new recipe. The sesame chicken calls for soy sauce, sherry, maple syrup, and oddly enough, its a weight watchers recipe. I have high hopes for the results.  I am stalling. I told myself I would go and give blood today but now that I am home, and it is miserable out, I am less interested in going out. I really should do it though...The problem is that I was rejected last time because my iron level and sugar was too low. Its normal for me to have low iron, us women always tend to, but the sugar was due to being on a diet. Which means that I may very well get turned away again because of it. I'd be pretty peeved if I went and I was turned away. I think the best thing to do would be to eat something to get my sugar up before I go, but that would sabotage my diet. What to do, what to do....  my BF reminded me recently that he got money back from doing his taxes last year. I forgot all about that, so now I've got it in my head that I'm getting a windfall. Something to dream about until I get my totals back.  ok, my entry needs a list. Today's topic: favourite chocolate bars/candy :  1. dolfin - 88% dark chocolate with earl grey pieces. yum. 2. turtles, turtles rah rah rah 3. the cadbury creme egg...a sugar injection straight to my heart 4. cadbury fruit and nut chocolate bar...love those chewy pieces 5. hersey bar - note: only the american version. the chocolate tingles on my tongue, probably very bad for me, but it feels so good   ok, one more list.  stuff I hate that everyone else loves:  1. sushi - I am so tired of hearing how healthy it is for you. bah humbug 2. shrimp - its everywhere, like a plaque. the way they feel in your mouth..blech 3. mushrooms. again, everywhere! 4. tofu. I keep trying it and its not getting better... 5. any crapa frapa drink at any given coffee shop. I'm a simple coffee, espresso or hot chocolate gal.  oh, enough unrelated crap, I am feeling a need to go organize my shelves and poke at the hedgehog a bit.

      Today is a break from the ordinary. I am 'working from home' this afternoon because I had a doctors appointment this morning. The appointment was with my GP. I went to him to rant about my less than stellar gyno service I've been getting. As I hoped, he was quick to refer me to another gyno. He did not dismiss my problems ( a definite improvement) but also did not even hazard a guess as to what is causing all my problems, he said it was better not to get my brain working on all the potential causes. Maybe I'm a step closer to getting these things addressed, who knows. He warned me not to trash talk the other doctors to this new gyno, apparently they are a little sensitive if you insinuate their colleagues are morons. Makes sense, I will avoid getting too irrational, but I must admit, its not easy to be cool and collected when my hoohoo is concerned. Another thought --> great! Another person poking and prodding my hoohoo, isn't 4 appointments a year enough? No wonder its misbehaving... (funny thing about that is my GP suggested that all the appointments actually can have this effect of making your bits and pieces sensitive to all sorts of problems)  since i refer to my genitals so often in my blog, i think i need a good name to use.   vagina is so hokey, way too clinical.  pussy is degoratory, i find it insulting.  genitals, too boring.  poonany (?)  hoohoo, fun but childish.  snapper - don't even go there, that is so damn vulgar.  i need to do a survey, find something amusing but not insulting. any suggestions?   ****  apparently my email server at work has been rejecting emails from my friends. I think the cause is 'offensive words' or attachments. My friend Tara emailed me at another addy and I decided to see what offensive words there were:  naughty bits naked  um...I think the server is way too sensitive. I wonder how many other emails have been rejected because of 'dirty' words. in any case I guess its best I don't use my work email for personal stuff.

      I like to hold onto old emails from various people in my life. No, not for blackmail, but because its interesting to reflect on what I was up to at that stage in my life.   I have a couple from a boyfriend who I enjoyed being around, for a very short time. It was fun, but oh, it got dull fast. He was a simple guy (hehe..And he has no way to fight back against my commentary) and it was the easiest breakup in history. No guilt, no stress. But we did like going dancing...(for anyone trying to guess who that is, I imagine that would eliminate 98% of my boyfriends...)  I have emails from the moody guy I was infatuated with. I was star struck, he was a jerk. Live and learn. His emails are as stand off-ish as he was, and to be honest, I should have known better. I fell victim to his coolness. I was a moron. But with time, I realized there was not much depth there, just a bitter guy who could not see past the packaging we sell ourselves in. I'm glad that spell is broken, it was a very self abusive time in my life, I was addicted to say the least.  one or two from the ex, which still make me feel a little bad even now, over 3 years later. not too many, since we were together all the time there will little need for email. we had old fashioned letters...and he had better writing than i did.  a couple from when the BF and I started seeing each other. These intrigue me. Not that long ago, but almost a bizzaro world away. full of longing to be together. its hard to comment on these because we are together now, all other comments are in retrospect to the entire duration of the relationship with that person. let's just say they were extremely supportive emails during a really tough time in my life. i really wanted to be with him and it just didn't look like it would happen.  I think my problem is that I only keep the kind, emotional emails from the beginning of things. I often delete the angry emails almost immediately.   all this stems from a search i was just doing to find an email address. all the same, i will leave these emails right where they are, to be looked at in another year or so.

      I am your dentist... and I get off on the pain I inflict  - little shop of horrors  yup, today I must visit the dentist for a check up. Is she a brute? Not really, but I am afraid none the less. I always am. I've had a pretty good record, only 2 small cavities in my life (and only recently) but its an irrational fear and I've been like this forever. She thinks its funny. In fact, my adult molars still haven't come out (please, god, no...) and I fear everytime I go she will have an update for me (they must be removed! Impacted, impacted I say!) I'm stressed just thinking about it.   I studied like mad last night for my exam Thursday. I desperately need an A- or higher. The problem is I feel that to some degree it is just out of my hands. The teacher asks such odd questions, its hard to know what answer she is after.   I had a blast giving my hedgehog a bath yesterday. (yes, I am pathetic) I took some cute photos, but alas, I am way too cheap to get space on the web to post them. Maybe one day. I have a few of him trying to escape the sink or water, and he is looking mighty pissy. And then some shots of him falling asleep on the bathroom counter...Imagine playing and running around and then suddenly falling asleep on the spot...He's narcoleptic, I swear.  I received two email apologies for yesterday's development problems, that guy doing work without being assigned it by me. Everyone understands the process except this guy. I know its not worth pursuing, but I'd like to forward the email from my manager and analyst to this guy to show him I was right, but he'd squirm out of it somehow. Drives me nuts.

      I feel like I have to put soap in my eyes.  thinking about that dream I had last night and because I am very bored, I put 'Rachel ray' in a google search. Well, the third item that came up was www.fhmus.com with (ah!!) 5 pin up photos of her. She posed for them! She's a pretty woman and all, but shit, do all women take their clothes off when asked? Its not nude stuff, but its cheesecake... I feel like her innocence has been shattered. I wonder if that will be in my dreams tonight?

      A line from an email from a guy friend of mine (we are discussing getting together for a beer):   Looking forward to seeing your engagement ring!   ahem...Well, I scanned the room as I read this. 'what does he know that I don't?' A brief moment of excitement followed by distrust and then grudging realization...Wait...Yes, I see, he's making fun of me.   so, why, might you ask, is this something to be made fun of? Well, let's see:  1. I was in a relationship for almost 7 years that was suppose to end in marriage, but good old me, I broke it off. I had this idea that my ex and i grew too far apart over the course of the relationship. boy did i throw everyone for a loop. everyone (and i do mean everyone) was disappointed in me, which is hard to deal with when doing the most difficult thing in your life.  2. I am difficult and moody. Always have been. I would like to think I'm a low maintenance gal, but what's the point, anyone who knows me could tell you otherwise. Also, I an anal retentive about working for what is mine and therefore protecting my stuff from others. Needless to say, I did not like sharing toys....  3. I am in a relationship now, and we are always teetering between moving forward and breaking up. Since this is the general status quo, its easy for my friends to (good natured as it may be) mock my relationship status, it never changes. I am always in a perpetual state of relationship flux. I'm sure the BF would agree...  4. As much as I think the symbolic act is important, the business known as marriage is an expensive and destructive force that I am reluctant to say I want for myself. Marriage is synonymous with babies, and I fear those... A lot. Its a topic I was vocal in declaring my opinion on when I was younger, but due to certain social expectations as I get older, and to not offend those around me, its best I don't shout out so vehemently how I feel about the matter. Its normal to want kids, a station wagon. Everybody else is doing it, why am I such a fucking child myself?   anyway, who knew his email would have me thinking so much about this stuff. I have a voice in the back of my head trying to remind me that I am still just a girl, not a woman. Those are things other people should deal with. Go to school, read books, etc. Avoid the whole topic. I don't want the life of a teenager, but I am a chickenshit in regards to the future; seeing older people I love age and die, my body staring to show signs of health problems that were unimaginable as a teenager, making life choices that are exactly that, for LIFE. Scary. No wonder everyone's on prozac.

      Some of my study notes for my exam on Thursday. Deny it all you want boys, its textbook stuff:   Men's strategies of resistance (to avoid taking their share of work in the household):    Waiting it out:  By not volunteering, men force their wives to ask for help. Women don't like to ask because it feels like begging, so they often end up doing the task themselves. Men act bothered or angry to avoid being asked again.   Playing dumb:  Men become incompetent. They forget lists when faced with responsibility, not necessarily on purpose, but they just withdraw mental attention from task. They get credit for trying & this way they are not asked again the next time.   Needs reduction:  Men don't do a task because they doperceivecieve the need to do it. (No cooking, because cereal is fine.) Women see greater social need (basic food groups, warm meals, ironed shirt, etc ) & give in and do it for the men.    Substitute offerings:  Men express appreciation for women's organization which acts as a substitute for helping.  ... I bet i can come up with a few strategies of resistance of my own in regards to social relationships. Patented H techniques that i have been employing for years in social situations unconsciously...i'll have to think on this and post and update later...they could be the official maxims for my introvert club. The club is thriving, we (and by this i mean me) have a book club and an official mascot already.   Current book: Middlesex. Mascot: Hedgehog (note that his qualities compliment the very nature of the introvert club) rules of conduct: In Progress

      Okay, I', getting concerned that my unconscious is getting way too dramatic. I had a crazy dream this morning that I met Rachel ray (the cook from the food channel) and it becomes like a cross between silent hill and a bad TV movie.   look deep into my psyche:  I am at Rachel rays childhood home where I find her original unpublished books of recipes behind a panel on the ceiling, along with personal photos, all seemingly happy with parents, husband, etc. She catches me going through her stuff and we talk and she seems so sad. I say to her that her life looks perfect, and she says that I will soon know how much it isn't. Then it gets weird because she disappears and I'm suddenly her, and pregnant. Her husband comes charging into the house (its old, like a haunted house, something out of silent hill) and punches me and throws me on the front balcony attached to the master bedroom. I scream for help but no one is paying attention. I can't just jump down because I'm pregnant. It seems like days where 'I' suffer abuse (the cuts and bruises seem to multiply and I am fuzzy on some of the details but I think he hits 'me' with a coffee pot in the head), and i feel like i'm in an unescapable maze of a house (more silent hill influence i think) and then one day I am able to grab his gun while he is sleeping and make a run for it down the stairs and out of the house. He follows and I can't run very fast so I turn around and shoot him, only getting his shoulder. People are paying attention now. He knocks the gun from my hands and as the police pull up, he taunts me by aiming the gun alternately at my stomach and my head. He shoots my stomach and I realize I'm dying, lying on the sidewalk. The police barricade the area but do nothing to help....And then I woke up, late for work, sweating and covered with wrinkles on my skin from hugging my pillow.  I'm telling you, its that book 'Middlesex' that I'm reading, it's messing me up. its not that this dream has any spoilers of the book in any way, its just that i've dreamed i was pregnant a few nights in a row, and the setting seems to be new york. and if anyone has watched '30 minute meals' with rachel ray, you'll see why this dream is so weird.

      Oh oh! oh! Big news flash....  I finally bought a pair of black leather boots. They pinch my calves a bit where the zipper closes, but the sales guy swore up and down they would stretch a bit. I let him tell me how absolutely 'normal' sized my calves were. It was fun to see him try, I think he was mystified that I couldn't fit into most boots. He was like, 'oh no, you are not big enough to not fit in these boots' but sure enough, when I got them on, he looked surprised that I almost didn't fit. I took a chance anyhow, cuz they are good looking boots (and on sale, I must mention that). No fancy brand names, they are actually hush puppies. I was surprised because the heel was much higher than the average hush puppy shoe. I feel a sense of completion.  these boots will be the highest heel I have ever worn. If I stop updating this blog, it is because I have fallen from a great height and need medical attention. Please stay a foot minimum from me on the sidewalk and be warned, I will try to grab onto anyone close by as I go tumbling to the ground wearing these good looking boots.

      On a completely different tangent, here's a haiku I wrote for the BF. It's insanity on my part to even think I have written something resembling poetry, but I'm not about to start crooning a melody so this is as artful as I get. Bare with me;  tickled by whiskers your kiss when I wake is bliss warms me to my toes  he'll know what I'm talking about. (I hope)

      Reading Middlesex before bed has been interesting, it has lead to the oddest dreams. I normally have some pretty vivid wacky dreams, but sometimes something, be it a movie or a book, creeps into my psyche and I merge it into my dreams for a few nights. I watched 'house of 1000 corpses' a while back and was seriously disturbed for a few days. I use to be completely unaffected by horror flicks when I was younger but its no longer so. I wonder if those movies can only really be enjoyed by people that have not had pain in their lives, once they do, they don't relate to those movies in the same way. I know that's the case with me.  I'm taking a day off this week to go to yet another doctor appointment. I feel pretty resentful of all the appointments I've been to in the last couple years for all my 'female' problems. I have had my pelvic region looked at by way too many people. I feel like my wondrous (**scoff**) female genitals have a mind of their own and have decided to shut down from all the poking and prodding. I've been good to my genitals, why can't they be good to me? Its never fun to deal with doctors, and then based on the nature of my problems, I don't get to discuss why I am sad or unhappy with my folks at the dinner table when I visit. Mostly, I feel gypped. I drew the short straw and got the raw deal. I hate that these problems women have must be so hush hush. When I talk to my girlfriends I often here similar stories about their genital health (I don't say reproductive because there's more to those organs than childbearing...) but we can't discuss it in more that a whisper for fear that someone hears what we are saying. The worst part is that there body parts that cause us such stress and neurosis could very well be the ones that kill us; breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, etc. boy aren't we lucky, not only are we worried about them being too small or too large, but the can kill us.   today I am pissed off that I am a woman. It's one of those days I feel like the world must be a much better place if I was a man. Medicine would be developed for my illnesses (its proven that more money is spent on men's health despite a larger female population) , I would automatically be respected instead of having to fight for it. My arguments would be just that, arguments, not irrational (and my favourite misogynist crap -->) hysterical ravings.

      This weekend so far has been pretty good. The weather has eased up on us for a brief moment and since the BF and I had nothing we had to do, we had a leisurely Friday evening and great Saturday. We ate, relaxed, rented movies, walked downtown in the spring like weather, got in a game of squash and had a kick ass Indian dinner.   so this is what it is like to not have work and school to contend with during my personal time. Ah...It was nice. People are pretty lucky when they have their weekends entirely to themselves. I know that my problem is self imposed, its mostly due to the extra burden of school. Well, if I manage it, I'll have 2 more years before completely free weekends.. That sounds a little pathetic.  today, its duty day. Homework and family obligations on both sides. Its all fine and good, I complain more than I should, but I really would like a commitment free weekend, just once. Maybe this summer I can hide out at the apt pool and act like a lush all afternoon long...  my ass is in serious pain after playing squash for the first time in over a year. Now if only I could figure out the compulsion I have with sticking my thumbs into the muscles that hurt. I think my problem is that I treat my body like a science project. I still haven't learned to leave pimples or blackheads alone, and ingrown hairs are like an adventure for me. Its not complete until the hair is out and I'm bleeding. I'm one of those people that can't blow my nose without looking at the kleenex after...It raunchy, I know. But its not like I'm putting it on my C.V. or anything... and besides i'm still being very reserved in disclosing my many ailments here. its like getting to know someone, it takes time to tell all the gory details so you don't scare someone off right from the start. so for now, suffice to say, i am aways being lectured to 'leave it alone, it will get better if you stop touching it!'

      I have always wanted to know the names of all the dim sum treats I love. I've been told the names time and again, but they are quickly forgotten. While surfing, I did a search, and what do you know, the names and descriptions are out there. I will try to retain some names for my next dim sum outing, but I though it would be nice to share:  -- Hargaw: Shrimp dumplings in crescent shapes   -- Siu mai: Open-faced, cylindrical, fluted dumplings, often pork and shrimp   -- Boh choi hargaw: Spinach and shrimp dumplings   -- Char su bao: Barbecued pork in a yeasted bun   -- Cheung fun. Rolled rice noodle logs, with shrimp, pork or beef filling  and my absolute favourite, grease ball of death:   -- hom sui gok: Golden Glutinous Rice Dumpling, pork or shrimp filling  and now, my profession of love to food stuff:  hom sui gok, I love you. you are the ultimate comfort food. crispy exterior, gooey doughy interior with a saucy meat filling. you transcend all other snacks. and how affordable you are! I realize the cost of 50 cents a piece is not the sum total of your expense to me; the toll you take on my arteries and cholesterol are immense, but I must have you. this diet is killing me, I think I need you, hom sui gok, to reset my inner balance.

      That's the catch phrase on this tshirt I saw in a store recently as I drove past on the bus. It has a cute badly drawn stick girl on it, complete with pigtails and skirt. I must have it, I must.  its Friday, and I have found myself will a bit of free time. I guess its not really free time, I have tons of stuff to do, but my brain has turned off and I am taking some 'me' time to blog and shop. I realize I own enough shoes and bags to cause dangerous tower formations in my closet, but I still look, for the perfect bag, the perfect pair of shoes....I know they are out there waiting for me.  yesterday was my opportunity for vindication! At last, we were handed out the course review for this gender and society class I'm taking. I was sinister, and scathing. I gave many 2 and 3's out of 5 and used a bunch of space in the comments section to state the following:   the teacher does not allow for discussion or opinions other than her own. She makes all encompassing statements that are not grounded academically and are rather biased, which contradicts the nature of the course. I was looking forward to this course but it ended up being a stifling and disappointing experience.   I needed to voice my opinion but I also wanted to be polite enough to have my review taken seriously. I know that they dump the both the best and worst reviews in order to average out the results. Maybe I'm naive, I actually think my contribution might make a different. Bah. And to top it off, I got all neurotic as I was settling into bed and wondered if she could match my writing and then grade me poorly on the 2 exams I don't have results on yet.

      this particular internet radio station is pretty good. when i get sick of my own collection of music, its a nice change of pace.  i have been very busy at work. participated in a 3 hour demo to our customers yesterday while trying to manage the going-ons of 2 seperate projects. things are going really well with regards to my dev team, i only wish i felt a little less apprehensive about the political situation here. its hard to give off a confident appearance when i am so clearly not confident in my (or anyone's) position here.  so, today's weigh in: 138 pounds. i lost a measly pound this week. i feel like i am failing miserably, and i know i will be an absolute glutton this weekend which means predicably bad results for next week. so, in three weeks of dieting, i have lost 6.8 pounds total. i guess that's a decent start.   tonight i have my 'gender and society' course. i imagine she will not have my exam results ready. its best to assume the worst, because there is no point in hoping she will have the results. i still need to figure out what i am going to do about my grades in that class. it may be the very reason i can't get into the honours programme.  ...and then, its time to watch 'survivor all-stars'. i am so addicted, i practically run out of my class to make it home in time. here's my list of my top five favourite survivors still remaining, but not that i do not expect my picks to win. the rule of thumb is, if i pick them, they are not winning!  1. Rupert (cuz he's such a sweetie) 2. Colby (cuz he deserves retribution, and he's cute) 3. Alicia (cuz she's tough and true to herself) 4. Kathy (cuz she's a likable person and doing kick ass this time around) 5. Jenna (cuz she conflicts regularly with everyone, it makes it fun to watch)

      yup. I am guilty of participating in the yearly spring slaughter of cute animals for easter and such. how? I went out yesterday and bought a pair of leather pants and a leather jacket. lamb leather. I'm a cog in the machine of evil. but in my defense, this jacket is divine. its fitted, black, cut to the waist, clean lines with zippers up the back of the forearms and a button clasp on the throat of the mandarin type collar. I can't wait to wear it but I must wait until it is warmer. and the pants....well, i've always wanted leather pants. for the fun of it I tried them on, and when I found out they were 99$ canadian I had to splurge. I was originally going for pants that looked like jeans, but this pair fit me really well, they are slightly 'biker', with stitching on the knees and a zipper or two.  now, before the image of me appears wearing all this leather looking like a biker girl, remember, I will never wear the two together. ever. the jacket is great to wear with jeans or a skirt, and the pants will have to be balanced with a girlie top or something. I must reiterate: never ever worn together.  trying on leather pants is an interesting experience. the saleswoman was hilarious, telling me that I have to force them on and pull a zipper up no matter how tight the pants feel, 'they will stretch'. she even told me that the zippers are guaranteed for a year for this very reason, so tug away! she had me in size 6's, and man, I think the outline of my ovaries was visible....I know I had a touch of camel toe going on with one pair. the pants I finally settled on were a size 8, and she insists they are too loose. they are not exactly leather-tight, so which I did buy them anyway, she ordered me a 6 that will arrive next week so that I can try them on and exchange the size 8 if I want. I am psyched to try them on and decide so I can get them hemmed and wear them!

      I can't stop wishing I could help this little guy. People can be so cruel.  the other day I saw a man in a wheel chair, his entire body from the waist down was amputated. I got a ball in my throat watching him, I couldn't help thinking that he is a much stronger person than I am. I was sad that I was the only person seeing him and feeling sympathetic towards him. I worry we are all to accustomed to ingoring other people. I also wondered if he would resent my sadness, the way I resent when some one feels sorry for me.  I am so sensitive to these images of pain, they make me so sad. I've always been tuned this way. When I was a child I felt sorry for any of my toys that I ignored for a short duration, I worried I was hurting their feelings. This runs contrary to the mean streak I have at the same time. I think I can be more cruel to those I know intimately than those I don't. Perhaps its my way of trying to control things, by operating on emotions I know I can influence.   I feel remorse for the cruel behaviour I employed in later high school, and for the manipulative behaviour I've used on my family and the men in my life. There's not much to be done about how I behaved ten years ago in school, but I do plan on shining up my karma a bit and being more conscious of how I treat those I love. Maybe that will balance things out better in regards to my feelings of guilt and compassion. I need some balance...Especially in these new boots I'm wearing ;-)

      The plan for this weekend is to visit a friend of the BF in Ottawa. He is putting us up in the hotel where he is a VP at, and also taking us to dinner there. I am thrilled at the prospect of changing the scenery a bit. Even more so, the dinner menu. Oh my god, it sounds like a culinary delight.  but alas, the guilt...Why must ducks be so cute, and tasty? I will have to do some kind of repentance for the kind of eating I'm going to do. I have decided to show no mercy to these little birds, I plan to have a duck confit risotto to start followed by duck prepared 3 ways. gurgle..drool. food is a turn on, I have fun just fantasizing over it.   which leads me to my diet. If I was a sensible woman, I would use my diet as an excuse not to devour cute ducks, they are fatty little guys, after all. Today I checked and I am 137.6. I will definitely put a ding into that this weekend. I need to remind myself that weight loss is a long term goal, so a slip up won't kill me.  in my life, food has been the source of great pain and enjoyment. When I was young I hated food, and resisted trying anything. Now I make it a point to try new things, within limits though as I am highly sensitive to smell and texture. I'll have to elaborate another time. I think I'm gonna go buy a new cook book.

      My brain is all over the place. Sneaking off to give blood, 'managing' 3 projects at work, working at the diet, exams at school, personal life crises, etc.   all in a days work for wonder woman, unfortunately, I am wonderless woman, queen of despair... super powers include keen type A senses that have great 'I told you so' effects.   I feel the need to list some good things that are going on now to lift my spirits: 1. I am doing super at managing the top priority project I am on right now. I am using a better, more authoritative approach. 2. I gave blood, I feel pretty good about it 3. I had a wonderful time at my folks yesterday. We all sat around the table and told jokes. It was nostalgic and therapeutic. 4. I am going out with some friends this week, a change of pace is needed. 5. I have a clean apartment and a kitchen full of good food.

      True to form, its a weekend so the BF and I are fighting. I'm getting the feeling that we are in or near the final round. Makes me want to go hide somewhere all alone and smoke cigarettes...Perhaps that is how I will spend the rest of my Sunday afternoon.  despite having to fake getting along with the BF, dinner at our friends house last night was really nice. raclette was oh so yummy. Another weekend of stuffing my gut, it will be another tough week for my diet. I was at 137 yesterday, but after all the eating this morning I'm back at 139. these friends are wonderful hosts, everytime we go there I marvel at how adept they are at it. they always have appetizers the minute we walk in the door, dinner is always plentiful and delicious, and they always have a nice wine to drink. pretty good indeed.

      I must explain the 'romantic' element of horror movies. When I watch a good horror film (this happened more when I was young) I have a full body tingle sensation for the duration of the film. When it's over, I can't shake that feeling. I was afraid to walk down my parents hallway, and even more afraid to pull aside the shower curtain before I went to the can. That kind of fear is grand. Its not based in reality, there's no real threat, so you get to feel the thrill of being scared with no consequence. Horror movies don't hold the same impact for me now, I don't scare as easily when it comes to zombies, I am more afraid of cancer and the loss of a loved one, and that stuff is real, so it's no fun at all.   the fact is, I am still fond of the genre for giving me a vicarious thrill. Like getting a tattoo or piercing, or the anticipation before a first kiss or unwrapping a present that you can't guess what's inside, these sensations put me through the roof!! They are romantic moments for me that I remember because they are acute and pleasurable. Don't get me wrong. I've had endorphine rushes during things like colonoscopies and colposcopies which I don't find nearly as enjoyable, but that's a horror story for another day.  and so, I will cap off this scary stuff entry with  my list of honourable mentions  (some of these are pure crap but I was young when I saw them and they affected my little brain):   1. session 9  a new film, and its got a real ambiance. Very different from other films, maybe its more a psychological thriller, but worth taking a look at. There's a scene or two in the basement tunnels that had me really edgy.   2. House of 1000 corpses  perhaps a bit too stylish, but this movie really affected me. I've seen it recently, and what got to me was the torture, suffering and depravity of it all. I had a few nightmares actually, so this one's worth noting. I always think to myself that in the backwoods somewhere, there are people this fucked up and ready to violate your humanity.   3. ringu  I saw this one before the hype, my dear friend gave me a copy that was being shown in a film festival. I watched it with a bunch of friends in the country in a dark room. The phone rang by pure fluke at a key moment in the film and the panicked reaction of one of our friends will make this one memorable for a long time. It was fresh and fun. I could take or leave the sequels and Korean or American remakes. The fact is, the girl crawling out of the TV screen is creepy, the remakes did not execute that scene with nearly as much eerie terror.   4. The stuff  ok, I saw this when I was 8 or 9. I don't remember most of it except for the scenes where people start barfing up the 'stuff' as it attacked them from the inside out. I have a really strong gag reflex, I actually started salivating right there. Bad movie, but those scenes stayed with me for awhile.   5. The birds  this one didn't scare me, but its a well known family (not so) secret that my dad was petrified of this movie. He gets very defiant when confronted with it - I think he has visualized it as a possible situation that could happen. Those smart birdies...Waiting to make their move and take over. hehe. Because of this, I have to respect this movie, its been the source of much teasing.   6. Friday the 13th  it's a saga, a long saga. The first one was enjoyable. Most people seem to have forgotten the real bad guy is Jason voorhees's mother! And the way those sexually loose women get killed, if it wasn't so funny I'd be offended.   7. Near dark  I've imagined that this is what it would be like if vampires really existed. Its not really scary, but its a good take on the vampire mythology. I use to be a role player, and vampire was my game, so I have a fondness for this one still.  And that chick with the white blond hair rocked, she was so pat benatar tough, I wanted to be her.    8. Dead alive  the gore fest to end all gore fests! I'm still not sure if this peter Jackson is the LOTR peter jackson, but this was a crazy movie. kung fu priests, cannibal zombies and death by lawn mower. yikes. 'I kick ass in the name of the lord' is definitely a keeper.   9. Psycho  he looked really bad in a dress. The evil chick gets it again. Moms are evil. That sums it up. The whole thing about this one is the era it was out. It was not very scary to me, but its reputation dies hard.   10. sleepaway camp  this one is fucked up. true, it was bad, but the plot is unique. The killers motive is that she is a he. The boating accident in the beginning of the film leaves the father and sibling dead because of crazy wild teenager boaters. We are to assume the daughter died but we now know better! It seems the film tries to say that living as a girl made him crazy enough to murder. I think the 'motive' was revenge against reckless teenagers for the loss of his sister and father. Its a real sociological study, this one. I saw this with a bunch of girlfriends, and we were all taken aback by the moment of truth. This, of course lead us to rent the sequels and laugh our heads off...   11. A nightmare on elm street   the scene where a dead naked Tina is being dragged across the ceiling was traumatizing. Again, a male member of my family thought this was ok for a 9 year old me to watch. Sure, Johnny depp was cute, but dead friends in body bads and being afraid to sleep messed me up but good. And the sound of those gloves scratching metal gave me the heebie jeebies.

      Tonight, my brother and I are honouring a tradition of ours by going to the premiere of 'dawn of the dead'. We are horror film buffs, always have been. Its a common thing we shared and although the 'romance' (perhaps I should explain this..) of horror movies has dwindled as I've gotten older, I am still up for the opportunity to be nostalgic.  to mark this occasion, I have here, my list of top ten horror flicks. Now remember, they many not necessarily reflect top ten of critics, but they are the ones that affected me most:   1. Poltergeist  my dad made the mistake when I was 6 yearsd old to let me watch it. I related to the little girl and the clown under the bed, I had an evil Ronald McDonald doll with long striped arms too (karma I guess...I later worked at McDonald's, a sign of evil to come). I snuck into my brothers room to sleep for about 2 months and drove him nuts. As so began our bond over horror films... My dad still can't live that one down, poor guy!   2. Halloween  the music scared the bejesus out of me. And Michael Myers was scary! This first was a classic, as misogynist as it was. I think I had a crush of Dr. Loomis. Jaime Curtis ruled.   3. The shining  redrum! I was young the first time I saw it and I related to the little boy. My god, its his own father that tries to kill him, what a quandary! And Shelley duval is entertainment. It had all the right elements to pull you in, the isolation, the slow fall into insanity!. The book had room 217 as the room from hell, the film has 237 (apparently because that number does not really exist in the hotel and management was afraid no one would want to stay in 217) think about it, stay in 217, its like the same thrill you get from going to the movie!   4. amityville horror   another crazy daddy, what a common theme. The idea of the hidden basement room gave me the willies! The book was even more scary, and when I was 12 the fact that it was based on real life incidents freaked me right out.   5. Evil Dead  Bruce Campbell is all his glory. It was funny and scary. Again rather misogynist, who thinks of making a tree rape a girl. Anyway, its classic. That crazy girl's laugh drives me insane!   6. 21 days later  a rather new entry to my list. It had a great underlying theme, it showed the horrible nature of people and it starred a few cuties I'd like to be the last people in England with. Awesome zombies. Its like post-modern horror, or horror nouveau.   7. Night of the living dead  another film that has an allegory at the center of its theme. This is the film that has inspired so many of the other zombie flicks. Pretty innovative for its time to cast a black man and a white woman as central characters. I hear the remake is quite good.   8. Carrie  there is so much going on with this one. Menstruation, psycho mothers, evil popular kids, REVENGE! There's a lot going on beneath the surface of this one. If you could take revenge, would you? S. King talked about the fact that the powers emerged at the same time as her menstruation, and that like teenagers with new emotions, the powers became hard to control or understand. Sounds like puberty to me!   9. The thing  frozen wasteland scary. The mystery was the best part. I think I need to see it again to refresh on this one. The xbox game is pretty cool.   10. Pet semetary  not the best movie, but the scary sister and the dead child stuff was freaky. My fav line: 'I played with jude, I played with mommy, and now I wanna play with youuuu'. heheheh.. creepy. oh, and when jude gets his Achilles tendon severed, fuck me! thats the worst! the truck scene? yikes! and to top it off, the ramones singing 'I don't wanna be living, in a pet sem-e-tar-y, I don't wanna live my life again' catchy stuff!

      Another week of attempting to lower my weight. I threw caution to the wind this past weekend, and I gained 0.4 pounds. So, my total this week is --> 138.4.  I think this weight loss is going to take forever, especially if the weather never lets up and I remain in my apartment without exercising. Where the hell is spring already?   good news and bad news for my summer this year. I will only take one summer session this year. Good news because I will actually see some summer weather as a consequence. I think I need to refuel anyway. Bad news is that I will be extending my time at Concordia another semester because of it. But my sanity is on the brink, so I think the decision is made.  I need to make pals with a statistical analysis guru. I will be taking stats II this summer, and its been almost 6 years since I took stats I, and even then I got a lousy 'C' in it. Thank god I found this neat website that is basically a stats tutorial. When it comes to being a student this time around, I must sing the praises of the internet. Using online university libraries and tutorials has been great.   today I expect to get my 3rd exam back from my gender and society course. It better be an 'A' minimum or I'm going to have a a great big hairy fit. yup, that's right, big and hairy. This class is totally fucking around with my chances of getting into the honors programme. I am pretty anxious about it, especially because she will wait until the last few seconds of class to hand it out. She does this thing where she stops calling names of exams to say something. She does this 3 or 4 times, and the agitation level in the room is pretty high. I bet she does it on purose to exert some control, I think I would if I was a teacher.  on the way to class I will dip into a small asian store in the hopes of finding a new treat I adore...wasabi peas. yum, I must have them.  oh yes, very important: yesterday I picked up my new, hemmed, pretty hot if I don't say so myself, size 6 leather pants. the sales lady was right (does that mean I have to stop calling them sales jerks behind their backs?), the size 6 fit much better than the 8. As I was prancing around trying on my new goodies I realized that I have a new Halloween costume: if I make my hair red, I can go as jean grey from the x-men!, I have the boots, pants and fitted jacket if I temporarily colour my hair and make intense faces like I'm concentrating a lot, blam-o! Instant costume. Cool. I think that would have to be the only allowable time I can wear all that stuff together.

      As we were leaving Ottawa on Sunday, I spotted a store called Venus envy. It was closed and I didn't feel like waiting for it to open, but now I regret not waiting.  its a women's sex store, and it is different from the usual crap because it is not a novelty sex store (sorry, no penis pasta or giant 6 foot penis blow up dolls). They sell tons of books and their aim is sex education. But even more importantly, they sell sex toys for gals that are not embarrassing to buy. They appeal to me aesthetically. Different stokes for different folks (tee hee) but I really do prefer the vibrator that looks like it came from 'zone' rather than 'super sex'. I saw a teaser of toys in the window that let me know I'd have a hard time selecting something, they were all made of soft latex (?) and came in cute colours (yes it does matter!). I like the fact they are metallic purple, pink or blue, and not flesh cooler or something. I've had this conversation with a few girlfriends over the years, and basically, most have pointed out that the further it looks like real genitalia the better, no fake veins, no flesh colour.  I guess, since the moment has past, I will take some time to look at their online catalogue at home (I can only imagine being caught at my desk researching vibrators, I shudder at the thought!) perhaps I will try something new and different, I'm ready for a change.   our vibrators, ourselves   I got my first vibrator from my last ex BF. it was quite a surprise, rather liberal of him to give me it as a birthday present. he spent a ton of money on it, and it was very funny because everytime someone asked what he got me for my birthday I wanted to burst out laughing. it was bigger than I expected and he would not leave the house for days after hoping to catch me using it. Naturally I waited until he was out of town for a few days. No need to worry about the learning curve, although, the super fast mode actually made me numb, so I learnt fast to avoid it. I have enjoyed it immensely and feared it being discovered by family members during a few of my moves. Many times I flung my draw open frantically to make sure it was still in its hiding place....As if it would get up and buzz away or something; or, egads! If someone tried to steal it!!  I never liked the colour (white) but I loved that it was a quick sure fire orgasm, and I didn't even have to undress if I didn't want to. it was fun to compare notes with my girlfriends, it felt slightly powerful to have such control over sex in this way.  sadly, because of all the hoo hoo stuff I have going on, I am rather devoid of sexual interest. so much so, a few weeks back I wrapped up my vibrator and said goodbye, down the garbage shoot. I felt a little sad, it actually symbolized a lot for me. Not to mention the fact that I could go so long without being interested in my vibrator is tragic. In any case, I will always remember that my ex gave me my first vibrator, and to be honest it was much better than any 'first time I had sex' story. I always had an orgasm and it was not clumsy at all.  I think I need to get back on the horse (the puns are coming to me much too easily). Things are not in functional order, but what better way to get things going than to purchase a new toy. I think I need some girlfriendly advice. its like buying a car, the models and features have changed, and I have to be an informed consumer to be the most satisfied with my purchase.

      about that article i linked to last week concerning the mutilated cat - they appear to have caught the guy. even more so, they caught him with another mutilated cat in his apartment. its propably too much to hope that the guy gets more than community service or something of the sort.

      What a weekend of sleep and food!  the BF and I drove to Ottawa Friday evening and started the weekend off with a kick ass bottle of wine (burrowing owl) with his friend Troy. We then went to the hotel where we were staying for free for 2 nights called brookestreet. The room was great, and the bed was fantastic.   Saturday was all about food. We started the day with a good breakfast ordered into the room, and later followed up with a lunch in a stylist bistro. I decided this weekend had to be a write off for my diet if I was going to enjoy myself at all. It was a bit more chilly this weekend than I anticipated so the shopping in the market was kept to a minimum. We spent some time in the lcbo (liquor control board of Ontario) and picked up some bottles of wine that we know we like at a better price than at home.  after a nap in that wonderful bed, we went down to the hotel restaurant called perspectives to dine with BF's friend Troy.   check out my meal: appetizer: Digby sea scallops baby spinach and shiitake, soya truffle emulsion main course: Duck served three ways natural pan juices infused with sage dessert: warm chocolate torte   the dessert btw, was served with a warm cup of liquid chocolate. The on staff sommelier chose a white wine for our appetizer and a red for our main, and they were both perfect (a sauvignon blanc and asanta barbara winery primativo)  it was a good weekend. Seeing as the next three weekends will be homework laden, I think the timing was very good. And now it's time to get back on the wagon, I have to reverse the diet damage that was done!

      Especially little tiny Easter chicks made out of pipe cleaners! I really need to get a photo on here, these cute little guys are to die for. With their little necklace bead eyes, pipe cleaner noses and wings, and plastic feet. I got them at the dollar store and they are worth so much more based on the entertainment value for me alone.   I have this incorrigible desire to squish them, they are so soft, fluffy and delicate. I feel like Lenny from 'of mice and men', I always want to squeeze soft things really tight. As a kid I always wanted to get a grip on a hampster. I didn't want to hurt them, just pump one in my hand a little. Needless to say, I restrained, I love animals way too much to hurt one. You'd want to squeeze one of these pipe cleaner chicks if you saw one though...One is staring at me right now daring me to do so...

      My teacher in class yesterday was telling us all how no good could come of spanking your children. When some students piped up saying that it seems that kids have no discipline these days and that many of us were spanked and we turned out ok, she responded: 'you don't know that you are ok. The only way you could tell would be to compare you, the person who was spanked, with the self, unspanked.' um, yeah ok.   I hate this woman for all that she says. I have 2 more classes and then I will have to try and avoid any classes she teaches from here on out (self and society, society and aging, I'm forming a list to be aware of).  I got my results from my third exam, I got an A. It doesn't make me hate her any less but I am pleased. This means I can get as low as a B in my final and still get an A- average. Its a double credit course, so an A- is crucial.  more annoying things about my nemesis of a teacher: she tells the class that the 3 most important days in a woman's life is the day she gets engaged, the day she marries and the day she gives birth. I made the mistake of thinking this was open for discussion, and I said it was sad that the most important days for a woman are always tied to someone else, there's no happiness in self. She quickly retorted 'well your not married yet I assume, that's why you think that way'. BITCH!   that's exactly my point, she believes in all the social scripts that she says perpetuates a woman's subordination. She's not saying we have to move past them, we just need to be aware of them. That's so passive and typical. She had the nerve to say 'that's what you get when you are socialized that way' she has no sympathy towards women and the cycles we perpetuate, she is only sympathetic to the plights of men, who are denied expressing their emotions in order to fit masculine roles designed by society. yeah, yeah, ok, its all true, but don't be so obvious about your favoritism. I bet she's the kind of mother that slathers affection on her boy child and disfavours her female child. she obviously takes side with the guys in the class while cutting down the opinion of the girls.  ah, but imagine, for a second if you will, me, unspanked. I'd be a cheery gal, with 40 % less cynicism, and a boisterous laugh. I'd have eaten my vegetables as a child, and surely I'd married right now, as I'm suppose to be. I'd have a son, and a daughter on the way, and I'd have a subordinate job to that of my husband, who I chose from the same socio economic class and ethnicity. I'd certainly wouldn't be searching for happiness in outside of non traditional boundaries, or questioning how things work. I don't think I'd like that person, but I bet she'd have better posture than me.

      teehee, I'm happy this week. My weight --> 135.6.   I lost 2.8 pounds this week, for a total of just under 10 pounds in all so far. The secret to my success this week (since the last few weeks were less than stellar) was to be more restrained on the weekend. I usually splurge on a tasty meal out on Saturdays, but then I go to my folks on Sundays and my mother does not comprehend the word diet so I often gain back the weight I lost. Anyway, I'm happy.  Hopefully  I can manage a similar feat next week.  of course I am sabotaging things at this very moment by having chocolate milk. I've been dying for some, and after 3 weeks of craving and denial, I bought a 500 ml container of it. Believe it or not, the whole thing is worth almost 8 points on WW, and I only have 18 points to spend a day! What can I say, I'm on my period, I'm crampy, I was some chocolate milk. Is that such a crime? I sound crazy, I'll just drink my milk silently and pretend it never happened.  I know I sound obsessive, its because I am. Not particularly about weight, that's just my new obession for the time being. I don't know how to be any other way. When I get into photography I buy a gorgeous camera, take a course and try developing my own photos. Interested in social issues? I buy every magazine available, take courses and basically torture those around me with social issues talk. I am obsessive, so its not abnormal for me to sound kooky about my weight or any other item I am intensely fixated with. I want to say this in case your thinking that my obsession with my weight is unhealthy. Its just my tendency of being anal retentive about all that I do, its not a particular issue with weight.

      I get email updates from The Council of Canadians regularly. I received one today about a public forum here in Montreal tomorrow evening and I am pretty psyched that I have nothing planned and I am free to go to it. I've been interested in the topic of American hegemony for a couple years now (I owe that political awareness to having a sociology teacher I adored and respected) and I am excited to see Maude Barlow in person. She's quite honestly a fighter for the little people and I think she is damn smart. Take a look at the link for more info  I saw an NFB (if you're not Canadian that acronym is probably useless to you) documentary on Maude Barlow and I enjoy her politics. She is a Feminist, a Canadian, and despite a political background (maybe she'd argue that its 'because' of the political background) she is concerned with issues that politicians try to silence like colonization, GMOs, unfair trade agreements, etc.  A description from their website:  Strictly non-partisan, the Council lobbies Members of Parliament, conducts research, and runs national campaigns aimed at putting some of the country's most important issues into the spotlight: safeguarding our social programs, promoting economic justice, renewing our democracy, asserting Canadian sovereignty, advancing alternatives to corporate-style free trade, and preserving our environment.   I think this year I will donate to the Council of Canadians. Every year I chose a group to donate to. Last year it was the Canadian cancer society, the year before it was the SPCA. Its hard to decide who gets your donation since there are so many worthy causes.   It makes me realize that I should volunteer. I have never volunteered anywhere, and I would like to, but my time is so limited (yeah, yeah we all say that, I know.) I'll have to think deeply on this one, I think it would do me good to volunteer, but once again, to chose a group makes me feel like I have excluded other groups. I think I will narrow my focus on either women's issues or environmental issues since they are closest to my heart these days.

      I absolutely do not need to buy anything. I don't really need or want anything. But, come lunch time, I find myself wandering around the malls downtown looking for something to buy. Its pathetic actually, its blatant consumerism at its worst and I am so guilty. Its Wednesday and I haven't spent a cent so far this week, but its eating at me.  my issue here is that I need to get this under control. I have enough stuff, clothes and toys. I really don't need another cook book but I find myself buying them all the time. I need this under control, not because I can't afford it but because I should not get use to this style of living. Its gratuitous and I have to be realistic. I am in a job that is pretty one of a kind. Killer benefits and a great salary. I realize I may never make this kind of money again, its not feasible. So I am trying my best to save, save, save for a future with less finance. And I do pretty well, I am a saver by nature. But I flinch at the idea of counting all the money spent on frivolous stuff, including food. I need a plan! I need help. Is being a shopaholic a real syndrome? I think I'm showing all the signs of being one. I look at sales flyers for fun! I browse pharmacies! I stop at every bargain book stall, I am always buying something on Amazon and I go to winners...I must be stopped.  help. There, I said it.

      I like to fancy myself a quasi-intellect once in awhile, but damn, reading Weber is not easy. His sentence structure is insufferable, and my gawd, the footnotes!!   I am trying desperately to have some sort of organization, I am aflutter with things to do and think about.  just when I feel like I have developed an air of authority at work, I have to work with cocky bastard, who I will call bastard for short, who is consistent in making things difficult for me. He was once a developer on my team, but now he has a duel role as developer/analyst. Now he thinks that as an analyst he can undermine my authority whenever he pleases. So I have to tell him that all other analysts have a process that we follow to help us work together. Now that he is starting to adopt these little processes, and I think 'ok, this is going to be ok', he completely neglects to follow procedures as a developer and buggers up my system. He's been such a pain since the beginning. Funny thing is, he seems to be oblivious to my disdain for him, maybe he just doesn't care, but it bugs me!! Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, thinking he is actually aware of the stuff he does that pisses me off, that there is some intent on his part. Whatever, he's still a bastard.  I had a brief moment just now where I feared someone at work finding this blog and using my remarks against me. Man, am I paranoid. All the same, I suddenly want to censor my work related rants.  I emailed my ex today, called him a wanker. You see, he wants to be my pal, and we hang out whenever we can, but then he gets a new girlfriend, and poof, he disappears. Not a trace until the relationship is done for. I find this unfair, as I have caused a bit of inconvenience in my relationship to be friends with him, and he totally blows me off when he has a new chick. Disgraceful. Ex BF, your name is mud until you prove otherwise. and I'm a damn good friend when you are available to be around, so its your loss.

      man, oh man, aren't raspberries awesome? i'm eating some as i type, and i am in love with them. now i am not talking about frozen, or canned or preserved raspberries, that's blasphemy. but the fresh ones, there's a party in my mouth! (i bet many of you at this very moment are making completely inappropriate jokes at my expense for that line...) speaking of delicious grub, that scallop and asparagus risotto i made yesterday was great. the recipe called for no spice at all, it depended on the subtle taste of lemon zest and red onion. i am quite proud of another culinary sucess.

      lots of stuff going on for me today, but as to how interesting it is for anyone else, well, not so much. first of all, my vision is a bit messed up, i am concerned its a pre-migraine vision problem. my first step to remedy this is always to play with the refresh rate on my monitor. i don't think it helped, so i am waiting to see if i must pop one of my mega migraine pills. chalk it up to stress, i guess... so that demo went pretty well. i survived. i did a chunk of homework yesterday, so i'm pleased about that too. i went to my parents for dinner yesterday and i feel bad now because i was in a pissy mood for some odd reason and i wasn't as nice as i could have been. my family are stellar for putting up with my wild mood swings, even i don't understand them sometimes.  tonights dinner plan: risotto with aspargus and scallops. its a WW recipe. i have only recently discovered aspargus (only a week ago actually) and scallops are a new addition as well. it's fun to try new recipes, and even more so when trying new flavours.

      Not a whole lot going on here this weekend. I went to dawn of the dead and it was more fun than I expected. I got home and cujo was on, what a treat. I  also found the wasabi peas I was searching for, I bought 3 containers so I could satisfy my craving, it was a tv/movie weekend so. Far I watched the second to last episode of sex in the city, the movie freida, patriot games, and tonight it's the sopranos. But unfortunately I have to buckle down now and do homework. In fact, if I post another undate here today you'll know I was slacking on my homework duties.  oh, and I have to present a demo on monday at work, and I am petrified. I am doing it as a favour because the guy thats suppose to do it is on vacation. Although I wasn't asked, my manager volunteered me. Its too much responsibility on top of the running of day to day stuff. I am really unhappy. Actually its more like stomach cramping anxiety. I don't know how I'm going to concentrate on homework because of this. Grumble.  oh another thing. Its fucking cold and snowing again. All things being equal, I am starting to have ideas bud in my head about moving elsewhere to somewhere more moderate. Once upon a time, that would never be a consideration, but I feel that doors are closing for me here and it sounds as possible as any other future of mine.

      ok, a topic change. in honour of the movie Hellboy that I plan to see tonight, he's a list of my top favourite comic books  1. battle angel alita 2. blade of the immortal 3. x-men (all the x-series together since they all tie in) 4. Preacher 5. The Sandman 6. The Watchmen 7. kabuki 8. Kingdom Come 9. What's Michael? 10. Strangers in Paradise  I worked in a comicbook store for almost 3 years. I loved comics for around 10 years. In the last few years I have not been into them as much and I must admit I miss the stories and the art. Some of my favourites here were only mini series, or the run has already come to an end. But these are awesome books, I highly recommend them for any of you comic geeks out there. I did not read Hellboy, but since I was responsible for putting aside books for 200 customers with a comic reserve list, I got to peep inside many books that I did not buy personally, hellboy being one of those.  another geek note: my efatuation with female comic characters  I always wanted to be Rogue from the X-men. A complete romantic fantasy that I would look like her (a la Jim Lee art) and have her tragic romantic inability to touch. I also wanted Gambit as my boyfriend to lust after me, the girl who could not be touched. I use to think the blond streak in my hair was similar to hers. And man, did I want to have her body and wit. She could fly, had super strength and could steal other people's powers. And she was once a bad guy... as time when on, I wanted to be Alita, another tragic and beautiful hero. She loved men that were not strong enough, and long after they were gone, she was still fighting for her cause. The art is astoundingly beautiful. I wanted to emulate her strength of character and impenetrable toughness. I also wanted to wear a vinyl body suit with knee high boots. She is way too cool, I always wanted to go as her for Halloween

      Today I have been given the task of babysitting the department fish. His name is seabowl (a pun on Siebel, the software product we use) and he's a blue betta in a tiny bowl. he's on my desk and as soon as no one was around, I put a theory to the test: I took my compact mirror from my purse and showed him his reflection. As people said, he thought it was another betta, an enemy and he went crazy trying to fight with his reflection. It was pretty amusing until I felt bad andtook it away. I am surprisingly interested by this fish, I think I want one of my own.  yesterdays exam is hard to put my finger on. I guess I did well, but I was disappointed that much of what I studied was not on it. In fact, nothing of much consequence at all was on it, I saw nothing she could really grade us on, it was a bit too subjective. And now I can only wait and see.  my class conflict (for all you sociology nerds, that was a good play on words if I don't say so myself) seems to be resolved, in a way. It seesm they have changed the requirements for the sociology program, and added a class I need to take before registering for the one I wanted. You'd think they'd make those changes available to people a bit sooner so we can plan our schedules better. Anyway, luckily, I did register for that very class as a backup, so I'm already in. But this will lead to problems for me next year when I must take a labour intensive research and design course along side the honours seminar. but I am resolved that I will not tack on another year to this, so I'll do what I must to get it done.  I am pretty discontent today. Not sure why. Maybe its the crappy weather as of late, or the fact I'm smoking again, or the fact I have a ton of homework to do this weekend. Oh, and my apartment is a big old mess. And my hedgehog is not eating, and I have to medicate 4 times a day, and the situation with the BF is in the doldrums. blech.

      So swamped...I am drowning..  first things first, my weight in for this week: 134 pounds  I've lost  pounds in five weeks of dieting. I think after another 4 pounds I'll consider if I need to start maintaining my weight or if I want to go crazy and drop to 120 again. I don't think I'm meant to be that light weight, when ever I am its so hard to maintain. I think of people as having a natural weight, and I think my body is happiest at around 130.   so, the hoo hoo appointment went well despite other trivial crap. It was a miserable day, cancellations, long waits and an insufferable trip to the pharmacy. End result; I am now applying steroids 4 times daily for the next six months. I believe it is the precusor to my super hero future. Girl with the iron hoo hoo. Anyway, I'm pleased that someone has atleast given me something to try, I need to feel proactive.  tonight is my final exam for my gender class. I am a bit stressed, I don't think I studied as much as I should have. Wish me luck..After this I have one more class with that woman hating teacher and then its over. woo hoo. hoo hoo  this morning was my date to register for fall and winter semester courses. It was a long process and I think I got gyped. I got 2 of the three classes I needed, and I was blocked for registering for the third one. What gets me is that an advisor told me to register for it, too bad he didn't think to waiver any prerequites for it. Now I have to beg and plead with another advisor to get me the waiver and hope there is still place in the class by the time I register. In the meantime, I registered for a bunch of other courses so I would not be completely screwed if it does not come through. My problem is its a year long course, offered only in fall and winter. If I don't get in for this year, I'll have to take it next year, and I already have another year long class planned for that time. The advisor recommended I do not take them both at the same time because the workload would be astronomical. If I have to extend my school for yet another year I'm gonna cry.

      So tomorrow I have the day off from work..Its not a day to enjoy or even to do homework, but rather hoo hoo appointment day. Tomorrows harrowing schedule includes two, count em, two lovely appointments to hoo hoo doctors. Both situated in the same building and even on the same floor. I haven't told my regular doctor that I am seeing the new guy, so its like I'm cheating on him with a neighbor or something. I'm a bit nervous about the new guy. It can go one of two ways; either he says 'tough' and I have to live with the symptoms I am dealing with, or he sends me for a slew of tests. I've read about some of these tests and I am a bit frightened (take note, I am genuinely admitting fear here).  frightened enough to have crazy sad dreams involving my hoo hoo. I dreamt last night that I started bleeding profusely while driving in a car with the BF. Suddenly he's gotten me to the hospital and I am so sad and afraid because there's no stopping this loss, I am miscarrying and I had no idea I was pregnant. I have no control over my body, and I am so angry for this lack of control. I have a sweet nurse and two doctors 'cleaning up', making sure there's nothing left inside.  The bed had a rough scrathy brown blanket that was covered with peanut hulls and a cigarette butt. They won't let the BF in the room, but a doctor keeps opening the door and I can see him standing outside, waiting and crying. The whole thing breaks my heart and I wake up in a huge sob.   now, my hoo hoo issues are not reproductive in nature. I think my dream last night had more to do with my lack of control over these appointments and symptoms I have. I am depressed that I have to do so many invasive appointments and have no advice or tangible results. I feel hopeless at the best of times, and cheated when I am at my most volatile.   as for the reproductive part, it also had me thinking. For the most part I am not a kid person. Ok honestly, I'm the opposite of kid person. But the dream made me realize it would be almost impossible for me not to have a kid if I found myself pregnant. That is doubtful, since I'm on the pill, but still, I think its an important thing to have resolved before hand. The hard part is in making the choice to have a kid because that would mean accepting the standards in the way women are treated when they are pregnant, how they are treated as mothers and what their life becomes. If it was an accident, or unplanned, the decision would be made, I'd just have to make the best of it. On a basic level (morally or theoretically) I am not against methods to end pregancies, I just wouldn't in the scenario I am in today. But I'd be one surly bitch for 9 months, that's for sure.  I wish I had more desire to have a kid. But here are my thoughts and what holds me back;  Firstly, I am a child myself. Ok I'm 26, but I'm darn immature.   Second, I wish kids would just pop out of thin air at 3 years old, with instructions. No messing up my body or my mental health. I don't know how to act around babies, they are scary. Their heads a deceivingly heavy and the diaper thing is unpleasant. I feel disingenuous everytime I am forced to coo at one, like everyone in the room can tell how mechanical I am about it.  third - the families. Everyone has got something to say, and I can tell you right now, I know I won't agree with most of it. But you need these people to help when you are on the brink of insanity, so you have to be sensitive to their ideas....You'd think, since all these women have had kids and they know what the pressure can be like, that they wouldn't be back seat parents, but I am a firm believer that they think they have earned the right to critique because they had to deal with it themselves. In any case, I have heard nightmare stories about female relatives ignoring the parental decisions that are made, and I would have a hissy if I was undermined that way.  fourth - my independence would completely disappear. What's the point in telling me I can grow up to be an independent girl if society expects me to give it up halfway to be a mother. I've been doing a lot of reading, families are in no way egalitarian. As they say, women menstruate, gestate and lactate, its only 'natural' we do 90% of the work. (I can feel my heath rate accelerating as I write this, I find it all so unfair)  we are brought up to be 'free' of gender stereotypes and roles, but our parents lived in a traditional gendered way. They still have gendered views on domestic life and families. I'd argue that the concept of ball and chain should be rethought - I think it better applies to the woman and her family duties rather than the man and his wife. I predict that if I had a kid and then pushed off 'women's work' onto the BF because it would be the fair, egalitarian thing to do, I would be considered all around as selfish (oh yes, I bet hard cash on this) and a bad mother.   fifth - on a last note, I am a wimp. I am afraid of pain. Birth scares the bejeezus out of me. They incise your perinium to facilitate birth - how fucking scary is that??? I am afraid of my dentist because I know I owe her some molars eventually, I would have to be sedated to give birth. And the weight gained, the scars, the sex issues. 60-80% of women in north america experience mental problems after birth. Hello! 6 to 8 out of ten women, that's way too much! I'm not Mary sunshine already.   all that being said, I had a dream last night, and its completely irrational but I woke up feeling a sense of loss. Right now the BF is reading this and thinking how naive I am for not seeing the obvious meaning of my dream (some analysis please!). Is it about my hoo hoo problems? Reproduction? Issues with the BF? Stress at work? the fact that i need a vacation? (i an inclined to think its the last one...my brain needs a holiday, and some chocolate)

      I am the kind of girl that buys cool looking leather boots and then teeters around the city without a complete lack of grace. I smack into people while narrowly adverting gratings in the sidewalks, and I mutter to myself about the sheer quantity of stairs I have to climb to get around montreal. today I realized I am poseur when I took off my boots at my desk and slipped into my loafers to run some errands during lunch. I'm a girlie shoe fraud.

      Yesterday was the last class for one of my courses. I was happy to finish after a year, but ironically it was discussion groups and I actually got to talking to some nice people. I spent the entire year without talking to a soul, and in the last class I realize there are some interesting people in it that were worth talking to. Oh well, my own fault, I guess.  Thursday will be my last class in the other year long course I am in. This class I have no qualms about bidding adieu. Even better, 100% of my grade is accounted for, so no more work is required for it. I still have a term paper and a final exam for the other one which have been torturing me.   I am feeling a little under the weather today. I've had a pressure headache for most of the day. I am trying to eliminate cigarettes from my life, but its hard. I snuck out for a cigarette just now and ended up chatting with the big boss that is in from Geneva. I am petrified of talking to bosses, I get red in the face and very nervous. I speak too fast and generally sound like a scatterbrain. I think I managed to appear a bit more composed than I usually do, I really need to work on that. And for the record, the cigarette only managed to make me feel worse.  I need to de-stress a bit. I think I need to get into my kitchen and make a new recipe. I am thrilled at the prospect of a day off on Friday,....Good Friday indeed.

      I can not sit here and write about my life without commenting on the terrible weather. It looked like spring was coming, but tons of rain and a mini snow storm later, and its freakin' cold outside. back out from my closet are my winter boots and coat. I almost got to wear my gorgeous spring trench coat but it was not to be...not just yet anyway.  so, lets see...hellboy was fun. it was not profound in plot, but it was a good way to spend a friday night. the CGI effects were awesome. I went for coffee (and I haven't gone for 'coffee' in ages) with my brother and his friends before heading home for some tv and a glass of wine.   saturday I went for a massage at tonic. it was relaxing and just what I needed. they gave me a free makeup touch up...can you call it a 'touch up' if I was not wearing makeup in the first place? anyway it was fun to be painted up, I wish I could be as skilled. then I walked up st. laurent and watched everyone buzzing about. I went to coco rico to buy some (orgasmically) good Portuguese tarts, called natas, and a gorgeous loaf of corn bread. I also picked up some new merrell sandals for the summer. I am pleased with my purchase and oh so excited to wear them. even more exciting, I chose a pair in a colour called red brick, rather than black, which is my usual staple. then I came home, cleaned up a bunch and went out for dinner. it was a party for one of my brothers friends. I was itching to leave by 9pm so I did just that, I went home, had a nice bath, more wine and an early snooze in a freshly made bed. ahhh...  sunday was homework day. started on the weber paper, and headed out in the wind and rain to get some flowers for my nanny and visit her for a bit. my cousins were there, I find it funny to see my 14 year old cousin. she's a real bitchy teen, just like I was, I wonder how anyone put up with me.  dinner at my folks involved a hilarious and awkward conversation about lesbians. my brother was discussing a couple lesbians that were at the party the night before and my mom was saying that she doesn't understand lesbians. she wanted me to commiserate, but I couldn't, I'm a terrible liar. I said that if I fell into love/lust with a woman, I'd have no qualms about switching teams. My mom went ballistic, said that if I did that, she'd have all she could take (because its all about her) and since I hate men and I'm a feminist I must be a lesbian. It was insane, I whispered to my brother that we wouldn't have to guess how she'd react if I actually told he something like this, she had a fit at just the hypothetical idea. Then she calmed down and said since I was 26 it wasn't likely I was a lesbian, I would know already. I decided it was not the time to inform her I have kissed a few women in my day, and have had same sex crushes for as long as I can remember. It was fun to taunt her, but in general, that's her reaction to anything I do or choose. She is always saying I'm a 'feminist' with a hint of disgust, and I always fuck up my relationships with the nice guys I am with. Well, at least I'm consistent.

      Today at the bay, not only did I get a new henckels bread knife, but it was 50% off and I still had gift certificates from Christmas, which amounted to me paying 37$ for a 150 dollar knife. It completes my collection, and I got an astronomical deal. And its a beauty, its from the twin collection, the handle is brushed steel, the body is one piece, its gorgeous....  fact is, I love knives. The BF got me a paring knife/santoku knife set for Christmas, it was one of the best gifts ever. They are works of art, in their clean, elegant shape and functional simplicity. I've read in many places that all an amateur cook needs is a good paring knife, a cook's knife or multi use knife, a chef's knife and a bread knife. I've got a wustof paring and santoku knife and a henckels cooks knife and bread knife, so I am pleased.  I don't understand my additiction to kitchen ware. I think I'm suppose to hate that stuff, women slaving in the kitchen has been symptomatic of the evil partiarchy, but oddly, I find the whole experience of cooking is relaxing and something I take pride in. Except dishes, I hate doing those...

      So how am I suppose to get back on the diet when someone brings timbits to the office? hun? I'm at 136, up about 1.5 pounds, and I need to get a grip, but the donuts made me weak... Its not my fault.  I feel like my brain is going to explode. This week is going down in my books as the worst week I've had at this job yet. Its been horrible, I'm a basket case. My stomach is in knots and I am on the verge of a hissy fit. I need to turn this stuff around and start improving my situation but I won't feel ok until 2 of the projects I am on at work are out the door. I guess all the pity should be directed towards the BF. ...I publicly apologize, I am a bitchy freak these days

      Ok, instead of paragraphs and paragraphs consisting of whining and complaining, here's my lament in point form.  1. I can't quit smoking. 2. They stopped making my birth control pill, the one for pre menopausal ladies (BTW..I'm 26) now I have to change and I may have an adverse reaction to it like I did when I was 18 years old. 3. My manager is torturing me 4. I have a big exam to study for 5. I gained weight from the lousy week of eating I had 6. I wrote a terrible paper for my classical social theory class. I dread getting the grade 7. I had a pap a couple days back and my doctor was careless and caused me to bleed and be in pain for a few hours. 8. Work is threatening crazy overtime again, and I'm exhausted before even getting started 9. My hedgehog hates me 10. Statistical analysis II. I am signed up for a summer of suffering at the hands of standard deviation  to be fair, because I sound like a big fat loser, I will add some good stuff in point form:  1. clinque bonus time 2. I'm been cheating on my diet, so I've been eating tasty food 3. Wine. I have it, and I will drink lots of it 4. The BF is being totally supportive of my work rants, it does a lot for my mental stability 5. My brothers birthday was yesterday and I had a really good time with my family 6. I am almost done with the year long never ending semester. 7. Roasted gea peas are good to me. 8. I'm still 10 pounds lighter than before. After tomorrow, its back on the horse to lose the last 5 or so pounds. 9. cheques from my tax return, ahhh, pennies from heaven. 10. patrica highsmith books. Brain candy to keep me sane.

      What exactly is it about clinique bonus time that gets me so excited? I'm a nutbar, I rush out to get my freebie products and then I hide at my desk to 'play' with my new toys. Sample sized creams, perfumes or eyeshadows...Its all good but the cincher it the free full sized lipstick. Their lipstick is gosh darn expensive, so a free one gets me going in a big way, especially when its a colour I like. I have a huge basket of clinique products at this point, which means both that I am spoiling myself and that I truly have an OCD. I rationalize that I only buy products when the bonus is on, but that doesn't make up for the fact I hunt down the bonus from the bay, to sears, to les ailes to get it. (it's only because each one offers different freebies, I swear!)

      Despite slacking on my diet these past couple weeks, I am down to 135 pounds again. The only way I can explain it is stress and cigarettes. I'll need to get back on the wagon ASAP since I plan to quit smoking (again) once this pack is finished. My dad told me that he heard somewhere that smoking cigarettes burns 200 calories a day, I wonder if that is the 'fact' or urban legend that has everyone saying that smoking helps lose weight. In any case, I've got to be more realistic about smoking, hearing about people I know dying of one form of cancer or another, I feel like a bit of an asshole still doing it. I think I've got 5 cigarettes left, this should be fun.

      A co-worker of mine punctuated the end of a conversation with me with a wink. I thought about it on the way back to my desk, its quite a funny thing. A couple guys in the department do this, and I find it an interesting phenomenon. Its not that I find it offensive, but that it occurs so naturally and I don't normally think twice about it. I am trying to imagine a situation where I wink at a co-worker...Just the idea has me in hysterics. I wonder if they have perfected the art of winking in confirmation or if it has ever fallen flat. Its a rather seamless punctuation on their part, or I would have singled it out before now. Another interesting fact: all the guys I'm thinking of are European, perhaps it is a more common gesture? Curious stuff. i will have to get to the bottom of this (*insert wink here*)

      I just gave my little man, Gord the hedgehog, a much needed bath. He thanked me by taking a dump and piss on my bathroom counter and towel. gotta love the little guy, he knows how to show gratitude.  oddly, I enjoy giving him a bath because it is the only time when he's too freaked out to be defensive, so I get to pick him up a lot and pet him. I must admit, I never had pets growing up , and since I need to get the fur-less kind, this was the best I was gonna get. I figured he would warm up to me and eventually the quills would hardly be noticeable, but that is just not going to happen. I've gotten fustrated a lot faster than I imagined and I find trying to make him like me is too much effort for too little rewards.  so the little bugger gets his meal worms, and I give him this super wheel I ordered from nova scotia, and I make little attempt to bond. Its not like he'd remember it anyhow. But there's always bath time... (I know that can be misconstrued a million different ways as a joke at my expense, its a good thing I'm too much of a lame brain to add comments to my blog)

      For someone in particular:  no need to be reactionary, different people see newness as wearing off when morning breath isn't cute anymore, others revel in finally being past the new car scent. I'm mixing metaphors, but I really just mean that I envy people like you or 'smitten' who have that feeling now, today, because it feels good to experience that, and I am craving some positives in my life right now. I'm not searching for drama, but I happen to like that fresh relationship feeling. My post wasn't a way to say how I think relationships should be, just how I wish I felt today, hence the envy.  as sarcastic as I sound, the sarcasm is self directed. Re-read my blog and picture the subject of my rant as 'me', not 'you'. The reaction seemed a bit judgmental and a tad unfair.   peace out

      Many of the blogs I read these days are by people that are in new relationships and riding the super new relationship wave of bliss. I envy them because that feeling has completely dissipated from my life, and I'm sure the life of my BF.  I wish you could siphon some of the bliss of the first year and bottle it for emergency use later on. I envy the new relationship high as much as I fear the newly single 'freedom' when exiting a relationship.   hallmark should make cards heralding the new relationship, most people want to sing and tell everyone how happy they are, isn't that an event that should be marked by a card? maybe i'll design one of my own... 'enjoy it now kids' or 'its ok if you face hurts from making out so much, carpet burn and stubble burn is no big deal'. you could have a consolation card for the end of romance in your relationship, something like 'so your bad habits aren't cute anymore' or 'you can start wearing lipstick again because the spontaneous kissing is over...  in any case, to the people in new relationships out there, enjoy, you probably have the envy of many out there reading. i think i'll try hugging my hedgehog tonight...now thats an affectionate relationship, let me tell you.  ---  I wrote a lot more on the subject and forgot to post it - mostly on how my relationship compares to the ideal type of a new relationship. When I returned from lunch I re-read it and thought better of it, so I deleted it. Its one of those things, I'm really emotional right now due to a million different things and I don't want to be held liable for things I say while cranky. here's a formal apology to Gord, the hedgehog...you're as affectionate as you can be, its not your fault you have spikes for a coat and a 10 second memory capability, i still think you're cute.

      On the lasik website (I am researching laser eye surgery very thoroughly), they discuss the option for monovision. The procedure is basically to give the individual vision correction for near sightedness in one eye, and correction for farsightedness in the other. In order to prepare the patient, they recommend the person wear two different prescriptions for an extended period to see if they can get use to living with monovision.  what a crazy idea, I can only imagine the nausea felt due to having monovison. I wonder how many people opt for this? Do these people close one eye when they want to see far, and close the other when they want to see near? I thought the whole laser surgery procedure was intimidating, but this option sounds ludicrous. Still, I'd be interested to know more... what other things could you do? One eye as a magnify glass? sheesh... Or laser a shape in your eye so everything has a heart shaped frame.... (believe it or not, I'm trying to stay within realistic options, I was going to suggest bono vision, or infrared but that's just being silly...)

      I received bad news from the superiors this past week that my team will have to work 6 day weeks again to get our current project out the door. Last summer was ruined by 16 consecutive weeks of overtime and 6 day weeks. It was grueling, and it really affected me. I am so beaten down already, I can't even imagine a week or two more like this past one. My personal life really suffered last time and already with part time school and full time work I am overwhelmed, but add to that even more work and all the office politics behind it and I am on the verge of a break down. I found myself standing at a bus stop crying last Friday because of the consistent cruelty of my manager, and its just the beginning. I am torn, as usual between maintaining a successful job versus maintaining my sanity. Am I feel helpless, like the only tool I have is to vent to the poor people in my life that really don't need to hear about this stuff. I need vacation in a big way, I feel like my energy level has been at 50% for ages now...And no amount of eating or smoking cigarettes is helping. How am I going to get out of this funk without too much compromise? I guess the first step is setting a mantra in my head along the lines of 'its just a job, don't get upset'. That, and actually getting to the point of believing it.

      Aside for the madness that is my job, I have been thinking about buying something fun to divert my attention these days. I've been weighing the pros and cons about purchasing that really, really cute 12" ibook. The biggest con is simply the cost, its an expensive toy I don't exactly need. But I do think it would be great to take my notes in class and do my homework. It is way more portable than any other laptop and the best part is they just announced new upgrades to the model, so I'd get some good memory and speed for my buck. Also, I just got a mini raise, which seems to me like the universes way of saying 'go for it'. What to do, what to do.... Any opinions, anyone?

      tee hee, went out in the sunshine at lunch and I wondered into the Bay (must be a sixth sense) and a big sale on purses. Jackpot! I found a nine west purse down from 65$ to just under 20$. I was giddy.  first off, I never used one until I was almost 20 years old. I thought they were too girly, and I carried my wallet in my ass pocket. But my wallet got big, and so did my bum, so it was time to carry it elsewhere. So I adopted a backpack. That worked while I was going to school and tae kwon do, but once I started a career, I realized that the backpack looked terrible with the swanky Jones new York trench coat I bought. My work clothes are on the slightly preppie nerdy girl side, so I decided that I would expand my collection of purses, which was at a total or one, which I used for every occasion.  in the last 4 years I have become addicted to shoes and bags. The trouble is that I still haven't found the right one for me.   my purses: 1. The old standby from Jacob, I know I must retire it soon, the black is a faded gray  2. A black leather shoulder bag by mexx. Too rigid, its impossible to find things in it fast and its narrow deep shape does not allow for an umbrella or a textbook for class  3. The black army bag. Its not exactly a purse, but it is great for going to a concert or some place I expect to actually be in contact with grass  4. The fendi knock off. I'm not too embarrassed its a knock off, I would never dish out the cash for a real one. Besides its made of jean with a silver buckle, its shelf life is limited. Also a tad small.  5. The perfect looking leather purse from danier. But alas, its square small size limits its usage as well.  6. The no name black doctors bag. The shoulder strap was horrendous, so I opt to carry it in hand, which is so tedious.  7. The gap beige hobo bag. Its an abyss, I can't find anything in it, and I stained it the first day I wore it out. Grumble  8. Yet another no name black purse with a faux army type construction. i.e. Many pockets with flaps. The problem is that its completely out of shape, but because it is almost ideal in size, I often put my crap in it and use it for months, which messes up my rotation. It's not pretty in the slightest.  9. The brown wool and pvc shoulder bag that looks lie a cross between a bingo bag and something to carry knitting stuff in. I have a strange attraction to it, although I can guarantee its never once received a compliment.   10. And now, the nine west. Its black pvc, with a silver clasp on the front. Its styled like a clutch but it has a strap and is a bit larger than a clutch. Its got an intricate amount of stuff on the inside for cell phone, keys, wallet, but for 17$ I'm willing to give it a go.  you've been warned, i may follow this up with a review of my shoes. taking inventory is strangely enough, a fun task for me. such is the life of an anal retentive.

      Today the support manager (she's one half of the support/development manager duo that control my life) told me that the duo will be going away for a two week span and that she wanted me to realize the added responsibility that would mean for me while they were gone. My immediate response (god, I need to slow down those instant reactions) was 'nope, can't do it. I have a new class starting in one week, I told the dev manager almost two months ago. I will not be available for extra overtime or weekends for the duration.' thud. She did not look pleased. She has, of course, forgotten that they already slave drive me, I am on four projects simultaneously, 6 days a week and she keeps trying to give me support tasks and now I'm gonna run things while they are gone? nuh un. Just because she peppers me with compliments she thinks I'm going to roll over, but god damn, I've been warning them for weeks that when this class comes up, I am scaling back. And now that the time has come, well, they have chosen to forget my pleas.  last night I had a dream that my dev manager was a parole office who chased me to Cambodia because I stole fishing hooks from walmart. It was like les miserables, he spent his life hunting me, and I tried to hid out with this family who owned a dog farm (the cute part of my dream I might add). Of so maybe not exactly les mis, but the struggle was similar. These people are really getting to me when I dream about them every night.   I'd complain more, but there's no point. I can't do much about this situation, I have become too accustomed to the money I earn to leave this job. But I just desperately want to see summer this year. I want to use the pool at my apartment, see some of the summer events that go on in Montreal, wear clothes for summer that are not chosen because of the office air conditioning. I feel like screaming 'no fucking way are you stealing another summer' but instead I bottle it up because when I do speak up I get punished in small quantities with extra bits of work assigned to me at 5pm. I just want to have time to get groceries and clean the apartment and still be able to see daylight. Whine, whine, bitch , bitch...I wish I felt more empowered.

      A week without school has been nice. Its great to go home, veg in front of the TV, eat dinner before 9pm and go to bed early if I choose. Its only a week break, but a nice taste of freedom that I will see again in late June. Tonight, bolognese sauce and survivor. Fun stuff  I am waiting anxiously for my grades. I swear I think if I see lower than an A- I might actually cry. I worked so hard to manage 'honours' GPA, it would really disappointment to blow it. I need to know, I'm all stressed out about it.  last night for dinner I had the ultimate in gross out junk food. The uber Italian poutine. Its massive and I am still suffering its effects even today. I wanted to get that craving out of the way so I can go back on my diet with no major food desires still looming in my head. oh was it tasty...gooey, saucy, chewy, awesome.  I finished the second to last Ripley book (no where near as good as the others I might add). I plan to start on 'first light' by Charles Baxter tonight. Ah, reading for fun, what a treat for the brain  today I am sporting a skirt for the first time this year without nylons. My legs were freshly waxed yesterday so I decided to brave the not so seasonal spring weather, and to my surprise its gorgeous out today! Its a complete break in my usual luck.  this Saturday is a Sloan concert. I had a lot of fun at the last on, so the BF and I are going again. I get to wear my leather pants, I'm excited. I'm betting it will be more uncomfortable than I imagine, hot and sticky, but I must take them out for a spin.

      Last nights exam was completely within my control. I think I did great, although I always feel like I am jinxing myself when I think things like that. Anyway, I was as prepared as I could be, and I did not draw a single blank. I have much higher hopes for the results of this class versus the other, more subjective class that I am still waiting on my final grades for.  I submitted a request for some time off in June, it sounds far off, but having a goal is a very good thing..It will be my light at the end of the tunnel. My manager approved, and its carry over days from 2003 so it won't even touch my time off for this year, so I am pleased.  other good things:  - the top I am wearing does not fit as 'snug' as it did 6 months ago, so the weight loss finally shows some benefits  - I am dealing okay with this not smoking thing. I am contemplating getting nicorette or something or the sort, but in the meantime its not terrible.  - I have no school responsibilities for an entire week before summer school starts. I felt utter relaxation as soon as my exam was done, and I slept so well last night  - I can go back to reading for leisure for a bit. I miss books  - I am ahead of the game, I got my mom a kick ass mother's day gift that I think is both stylish and sentimental.   - I have a massage booked for this Saturday to celebrate a finish to a long school year. It will be soooo good.  - the make up touch up after the massage - I love someone paying attention to me like that (like a hair cut or pedicure), it gives me this tinglely sensation, I find it immensely pleasurable. Funny how I hate most people touching me though...  - I had some sort of erotic dream last night that left me pretty content when I woke up this morning. The guy was some sort of amalgamation of all my prior (and current) boyfriends, and interestingly, it took place in my old bed at my parents place. It was 'on top of the clothing' type fooling around from early adolescence, and it was nice, the whole dream was about anticipation.  - I got a bonus and a raise in the past 2 weeks, so as miserable as work makes me, the financial reward is pretty sweet

      Today is my final exam in my social theory course. Needless to say, I am nervous, and wish I was anywhere but work so that I could study more. My bladder is tiny, and embarrassing to say, I have a hard time sitting for a 3 hour exam without getting the need to piddle, which sucks, it only adds more pressure. Good luck to me...  one of my co-workers came back from Hong Kong with a package of wasabi peas for me. I think its so nice to do that, I swear little gestures are the best, the restore my faith that people listen to each other and like to do nice things for one another. I think I need to do something nice for someone today.  I saw the corporation this past weekend, I was unimpressed at first, the facts seemed a little 'light', but after 20 minutes or so, it became more involved. I've heard a lot of the facts before in my course last summer in social change and social movements, so it was interesting, despite being bleak. I am a full believer that something has to change, starting with my milk intake.  oh yes, I quite smoking last Thursday. A few times a day I get an irrepressible urge to light up, I usually defuse it with some sort of food. Extremely bad for my weight goals, but everyone says quitting smoking is more important, so I'll just go with that for now and chase away my blues with hot chocolates.

      My computer at work has been wonky due to viruses on the network so doing anything on line has been intolerable, hence the reason I have not been updating this lately.  this week has been busy. Work is the same story but to add to my disdain, I am working at 8am on Saturday. Making me work on the weekend is one thing, making me get up so damn early is a mistake. I guarantee a very moody me at 8am Saturday. There better be donuts waiting for me.  great news for me, I have my grades for the two year long course I took, I have an A and an A+. I am extremely pleased, I just wish people we as elated as I was when I tell them. Its not a big deal to anyone else, understandably, but man did I bust my ass to get those grades. yay!  I started my stats class. Its intense, lots of work, and more advanced than most the dummies books I bought. So far my head is still above water. My only fear is all this work overtime conflicting with my homework. I kind of enjoy it though, it goes fast, and I feel like I'm working on a puzzle. As is my nature, I am quite pleased with myself when my results are correct. One week down, 6 more to go.  diet? What diet? I'm eaten like a pig, and now I'm starting to feel yucky. I weighed myself today, 136, so not much weight gain, which is surprising, especially that I'm still on the quitting smoking attempt. I really need to get back to that before I reverse all the work I did...Trust me, not eating what I want is work.

      Another Sunday at work. Its rainy out so it doesn't seem so bad, but man was it hard to wake up today. As today will be dull and not worth writing about, I will write about yesterday which I'm sure was a lot more fun.  I started the day with a mcevil breakfast and a walk up st. Laurent. It was beautiful out so I was sporting my freshly waxed legs, a skirt and my new rockin merrell sandals. By the time I made it up to prince Arthur, my feet were on fire. I grabbed a double espresso allonge and sat outside to discover a multitude of blisters on my feet. The dye from my sandals and the open blisters made me think of smoked salmon. So after gulping back the espresso and attempting to ignore an annoying guy that would not let me have my 'romantic moment' alone, I trudged over to the pharmacy for some bandaids and a foot tube. The foot tube is something new to me, its a tube of pantyhose material that you slide on your foot and you wear it under a sandal. I think it may be to prevent slippage, but I got to tell you, its all about blister proofing to me.  with newly bandaged feet I did some window shopping and arrived at tonic for my massage, courtesy of work insurance. I must reiterate that Christine at Tonic is wonderful. I've seen her many times at this point, and its always a treat. I look like I've woken from a 12 hour sleep when I walk out of there.  after the massage and make up touch up, I went back home for a foot gear switch and the BF and I strolled to westmount to grab lunch at clairmont. I confirm my opinion that they are way overpriced, but it was nice to enjoy lunch on a nice day without worrying about time or things to do. We took a foot break in westmount park on the way back home (my feet were throbbing, and I am a huge baby about blisters) when we got home we combined our efforts and cleaned the apartment. It was much needed, and despite not wanting to do it, I was glad when it was done.  with a shower and nookie break taken care of (tee hee), I got geared up in my fancy new leather pants and we went out for dinner. We ended up at pho bac, one of the two first tonkinese soup shops in mtl located in Chinatown. pho bang had a line up (the number one choice) so we went down the block to pho bac, and it was great food. Really cheap tasty food. Can't beat that.  after some good eats, we went to the Sloan concert and it was great fun. Montreal showings at Sloan concerts are not what they should be, and I have to say, its a shame, they are a fun band to see live. Lots of catchy rock music and they are quite upbeat. It was only 24 bucks a ticket, which is peanuts compared to most concert prices these days and we were standing only 5 feet or so from the stage. Club soda is a good venue, loads of bathrooms to go pee, you never have to wait in line, and trust me, that is unheard of at a concert, particularly for the ladies.   after the walk home last night, I decided to try out my new recipe for amaretto sour. I bought all the ingredients earlier in the week, and I was so happy with the results. I expected the end result to taste nothing like the real deal, but it was yummy. It was great to kick back on the couch slurping one of those...I must beware, I get addicted to yummy things too easier, my id is too strong.  so, busy day it was. And now I sit here at work, avoiding work by writing my blog. I loathe being here. I would like to pummel a certain co-worker to near death, but icy glares will have to suffice. A one day weekend is not nearly enough. Unit testing awaits me...

      I must have a sixth sense when it comes to survivor (either that or I am perfectly average example of a survivor fan, which could be true too) because I called it correctly for all of the categories for last nights 'america's tribal council'. I'm so glad Rupert won, its like he's been vindicated at last. yay Rupert.   I am a bit glad that now I have one less show I am addicted to for a bit. I regularly watch survivor, sopranos, sex and the city (alas, no longer), six feet under (new season next month!), curb your enthusiasm, and to my great embarrassment, the swan.   yes, the swan. I talk to myself through the whole thing, and have nightmares about it but I can't stop watching it. I had a dream a few nights back that I got breast implants and the monster stitches started opening at the seams, it was gruesome. Maybe I'll watch just one more episode before going cold turkey...Or two..

      Ah, its a gorgeous day out today. It was wonderful to walk outdoors during lunch and painful to have to return to the chilly air conditioned office building. I can't believe I have the whole weekend off. Yes, I have stats homework, but that's peanuts, I don't know what to do with two days off. Sleeping and drinking various warm and cold drinks outdoors seems like a good way to go about it.  although, the foot is still sore, I think the pain is ebbing away. my mom still insists its a foot ailment of some kind rather than a break or a sprain. We had a tiff yesterday because she still holds to the belief that I did not break my nose in elementary school. Long story short, little me breaks nose in schoolyard. I go home and mom & dad say its not broken. Life goes on, I go to a GP who says that I have sinus problems because of the break in my schnoz that didn't heal properly. My mom still thinks I'm exaggerating....That being said, I take what my mom says to heart about all except health and health care practices. Its a catch 22, I swear, don't go, it could be broken, go, find out its a bunion. I lose either way. I figure don't go, save wasted time and and prepare for my mom's 'I told you so's' which will only serve to validate to her that I never broken my nose either. ho hum...

      While watching an episode of the soprano's I taped yesterday, I found the story arc with Janice and her attempt to deal with anger management really relatable. I don't usually take the sopranos to heart, for obvious reasons, but the bits and pieces about anger, rage and dealing with feelings was pretty interesting. They discussed how the character, Tony, has depression, which is rage turned inwards, while Janice expressed her rage at others.   The siblings have different ways of expressing the same emotion, and I can relate that to my brother and I. My brother is generally a happy guy who, when put upon, shouts a string of obscenities so rude that I am tempted to cover my ears. It's funny and at the same time its a bit scary, it gives a glimpse of the kind of anger he is capable of, and it can seem menacing. On my side, I am all too quick to express my discomfort, dislike, discontent, dis-whatever. I feel put upon by the world sometimes, and I realize how irrational that is. Combine that with my occasional bouts of insanity when I am so angry (usually the result of relationship 'bliss') that I can spontaneously cause a headache and make my self ill. That's why I sought out a therapist, to deal with my temper, but I found it really ineffective. Well, atleast the 2 therapists I tried were ineffective. I still believe therapy can be helpful, but until I find my very own 'dr. melfi', I'll have to keep therapist shopping. of course, maybe I need to see a therapist that is not a wealthy westmount situated PhD with a superiority complex before I feel comfortable enough to divulge my triggers.  and so, my favourite string of obscenities that my brother has concatenated: 'i kill you... son of a cunt whore slut'

      My right foot is killing me! I almost broke down and went to a clinic but a line up of 7 other people was enough to discourage me. I have this image of coming back to work where people will ask me, 'so, do you have a broken bone?' and I have to respond that I merely have a bunion or something equally mundane. not that I would prefer a broken bone, but whenever I think I'm having a heart attack and I know deep down its really gas, it makes me slightly embarrassed at how serious I take things.  I have nothing I have to do tonight. not one thing. it feels weird to not have anything pressing. I would consider getting on my bike and I've repeatedly lamented I don't get to do enough, but since walking is excruciating I think I will pass. Maybe tonight will be a good night to dive into reading great expectations.  I've decided to go with a theme for my blog for the next little while. Every post I will end with a favorite of mine. I guess I complain too much, so I thought I'd show that yes, I do like stuff, I just prefer complaining. Maybe that's what I should put as my favourite thing to do? nah...  favourite thing about my apartment: two bathrooms, a girl's dream come true. All my crap, all over the place, which to me, is in its place. I was giddy when I saw the 'secret' bathroom off the bedroom cupboard, absolutely giddy.

      wow, so many new blogger templates to choose from and modify! i can't even begin to chose, since i will want to buckle down and start personalizing it rather that just selecting one. maybe change is good..i am inclined to take the pink one (since my current GUI is rather girlie as is) but perhaps it is time to get a fashion update, it is spring after all.  a new aquisition: today at lunch i stopped by paragraph and discovered great expectations for 4.99. i've never read the classic, so i though i'd give it a go. so far i'm surprised at how funny i find it. i'm also reading the price of salt at the same time, by patricia highsmith. its about a lesbian relationship written in the 50s or 60s and it really sparks something in me...i've had same sex crushes that have defintiely felt the way the author is describing at this point in the book, although it is pretty early on. i get the feeling its going to get very thelma and louise towards the end, lesbians cannot be allowed to live happily ever after in media, can they? stay tuned, perhaps i will ruin the ending of that novel for anyone reading...  another unrelated item i lent 'donnie darko' to my dad, which i bought very cheap. i saw it once on the movie channel and i was enthralled and confused. the music and character design hooked me, and the story was interesting enough for me to read up on the theories it was built on. anyway it surprised me how much i liked it, and the music (the song mad world is beautiful). anyway, my dad predicted the end halfway through the film. am i really dense? why didn't i see what was going on? my dad is a sci fi buff, so i can excuse it away through that argument, but sheesh, i never caught on. it appears he has that category licked if trivia pursuit ever comes out with a sci fi version.   ...but for the record, i KNOW some people will disagree (you know who you are) but i am the god damn queen of star wars trivia pursuit. I RULE, never forget it. i am accepting challenges to my title but please don't take it too hard when i defeat you chumps again :-) bwah hahah...man, that was nerdy.

      oh man, blogger has changed its GUI and it has me intimidated. I'm a techie of sorts, so I shouldn't be freaked, but I can't help myself, I don't like change. grumble...  so, I spent 13 hours at work on Saturday, can you say overworked? I am at my wits end, and all of a sudden, I have a little birdie at work trying to influence me to fight the power. it's tempting, but its standing in direct opposition to my need to please my superiors. but I don't think I can stomach much more bullshit, I think I may have to act out and just say no. Naturally, I'll keep you posted..  the BF set up my new clipless pedals and cleats for my beautiful trek mountain bike on sunday. I took a short lesson on the basics or quick entry and exit (no euphemism intended) and was feeling pleased with myself when I pulled into my garage and promptly panicked when I couldn't unhook from the pedals and fell over. whump. Skinned wrist, bruised ego. Oh well, at least that's over with. But now, a couple days later I am a bit concerned...I think I managed to break a bone in my foot. Its excruciating, I am hobbling around town with a grimace. I am resisting the urge to go to the ER to get x-rays, I do not want to waste 5 hours of my life to be told there's nothing to be done. My mom says, I'm an idiot, its probably a bunion...Reminds me of the time she said my nose wasn't broken.  I received my new cookbooks from Amazon the other day and I was quite disappointed. I really thought I was going to enjoy them, it sucks to anticipate something so much and find it a let down.  I wish I could find time to update my blog more so my updates would be less eclectic. Work has been so busy and I feel so monitored that I refrain from updating. But I saved a sametime message from my boss to post here when I get a chance, to show how pure his evil truly is...  oh! oh! Amber winning survivor so totally sucks that I might be put off the whole franchise..Why was everyone so damn stupid to practically give her and rob the money? numbnuts, all of them! I must admit to logging onto cbs to vote for rupert to get the extra million dollar prize. I can't help but like him, he has no inhibition whatsoever. he may be transparent, but seems like such a genuinely sweet guy...Vote for rupert!

      today i called my mortgage broker and renewed my preapproved mortgage. the BF and i have once again renewed talks about buying a place and we have our eyes on two places in particular. both are in verdun, so, slightly more affordable than westmount or NDG. BF has already seen one, and reported back with some digital pictures, it was enough of a success that we will go back together. the second, we are seeing on saturday. its exciting and scary. scary because it involves money that has yet to be earned, exciting because i romanticize the very idea of it. also, these places are reasonably priced, and in an accessable area (and they look great). they are condos, and still central enough for me to feel that i have not suburbed myself, i think i'd have an identity crisis if at 26 i moved far away from city life. don't get me wrong, single dwelling with a yard sounds fun, but later. to be continued...

      In my stats class yesterday, my second assignment was returned and I was so sad to see that I am a moron that can't copy correctly. I copied the values given on the question sheet and made a 6 look a lot like a 1, and so, all my results after that were off. I bet my teacher thinks this student is stoopid. I got a passable grade because he's a good Samaritan and gave me half marks, but I feel like such a dolt. This shook me up a little right before my mid term, but it did make me very aware. I reviewed the calculations of the entire exam in full when I was done, and I think its bulletproof. argh, waiting for results is torture.  yesterday I was told I could have the weekend off. All 3 days of it. I was in disbelief, and very distrusting, they always pull the carpet out from under me. Today the evil duo manager team, were very confrontational in our daily call; I saw it as their way to trap people into working, if not on the weekend, then definitely tonight. The team in mtl deafly avoided any tricky topics, you could smell the desperation of all of our combined desires to have 3 days off. I thought I was in the clear, but then I was told I would be called later to see about some work for today (most likely to be done as late as possible on a Friday to really stick the knife in) and that they will call me Monday to review outstanding change requests. I imagine I'm suppose to be grateful that I have the day off, only a phone call. But I know how this works, they call and if I don't have answers (maybe I'm watching a movie or walking outdoors) I am skewered. Bastards! You can't win. The more I resist the more miserable I become.

      ...Flinging shit from the trees.  that's how I think of my daily work meetings, held at a time way too early to adequately defend myself. It's been a rough couple days here at work, political power plays are the flavour of the month (or year..) I felt extremely threatened by evil support manager, she actually had one of her testers hold my daily dev meeting for me, with me in attendance. it was insulting and it made it obvious to everyone on y team I was in disfavour. In a rage (and panic), I emailed my evil dev manager and said that if I am being replaced, pls let me know so I can give the tester all the responsibilities that go with the meetings, since it seems they think I can't do the job, and I explained how embarrassing it was for the team to see me replaced without having been told first. This morning I was blind CC'd on an email from my dev manager to the tester, criticizing him for holding my meeting and to never do it again (blame usually gets pointed in the wrong direction). The evil support manager is also being very pleasant with me today, which makes me think they spoke, and he gave her a bit of a lecture about overstepping boundaries. its settled, but I don't feel right about things.

      On the way to work this morning, I ran into a friend. We run into each other a lot in the morning and despite the fact I am a crab before 9am we usually chat a bit. We talk relationships and what we think of being forced to be adults.i adore this guy, I wish we could take the chatting on the metro friendship level to a more in depth level, but as most people say this days, there's just not enough time. Today, he took one look at me and said 'oooh, hickeys, someone had a good weekend..' I must have turned many shades of red. How I can still be embarrassed I'll never know. For the record, they weren't hickeys in the traditional, well formed shape, more like Hickey-ish marks, so its not like I was walking around looking like a tart. It can be confusing for those friends that ask how my love life is going (its volatile at the best of times)and I can tell you, the BF and I are way more confused than anyone else. But yes, I did have a good weekend.   favourite thing to do on the weekend:  get hickeys.   (hehe...that's a cheeky one, isn't it?)

      I know I just wrote a happy entry, and I will now ruin the happy vibe by bitching about work related misery, but I must...After all, it's catharsis for me. I must gripe about something that was a bit of a wet blanket on my weekend. My evil manager called me Saturday afternoon, from the airport, to bitch me out. No details necessary, but I will say that he was looking to pick on someone so it may as well have been me, even when it was clear it was not my fault. He is such an insufferable cock (that is a fun insult!). Seriously, is that what a company phone is for, to call and torture people during their off hours? I bet he's a very unhappy man in his own life to be micro-managing mine so much. He has no idea how much he causes me to dislike him and how close I am to saying so.

      ...A weekend of no work  Friday night I went out with my brother and his wife for dinner and coffee and afterwards to their place to watch G.I.JOE the movie. shits and giggles, it was a good time, but for the record, that movie was not as cool as when I was 5 years old. I went to bed early and had a nice snooze Saturday morning. A leisurely breakfast at home and time to do stats homework. Sitting at my dining table, in the sun with a full belly and a cup of tea, I didn't even mind doing homework. A friend of the BF came in from Ottawa, so we had a drink before heading out, went out for a pre dinner drink, dinner, a post dinner drink, and then headed home for a Turkish cigarette. It was a fun night, and the food at Ouzeri is outstanding.  and then, a second day off! I woke up late and met my friend Joe for an awesome brunch and way too much coffee. I took a stroll with the BF, went to a few condo open houses and had a snack at calories. I had this half n' half, its a slush made of ice tea and lemonade flavors, its so tasty. I trekked over to my parents place for dinner, and headed back home to watch the sopranos with the BF. And to think, next weekend is a long weekend, if I manage to get all three off it will be amazing!

      We managed to get project sign off today. Management has told us we can take the afternoon off, and so I am leaving the office in a few minutes. First, I'm off to the bank to discuss wrapping out RRSPs for the house with the BF, and open a joint account, and then I'm heading home to wrap myself in a blanket and snooze on the couch. I am thrilled.  favourite place to nap: on the BFs couch with the BFs blanket.   I think I will go see 'the day after tomorrow' tonight. I am looking forward to a big effects movie

      I was so upset when I watched the sopranos this week, the fact that adrianna gets waxed off screen and in such a crappy way, I thought was unfair to the character that's been on the show since day one (listen to me, I am such a goofball) not that I wanted to see the character die, but that it seemed so inconsequential. I keep watching this season, mostly because I know its the last season, but out of some dedication to a show I've watched since the beginning. Its a terrible season, it seems like they had different writers for each episode, things barely tie together and with one episode I couldn't help thinking they it was just wasting my time. But like the person I am, I will watch the last two episodes, for a sense of completion. But I really how christopher's character gets it.

      Wow, I realized as I was logging into blogger that yesterday was my 100 post. I dread re-reading them, but I find it also an interesting way to find what I obsess about in hopes to lighten up a bit on those items.  today is the user acceptance signoff of our project at work. I am so desperate to have it signed off, knowing that may mean the end of overtime for a bit. I did a twelve hour shift yesterday, and still somehow managed to attend the inspection of the house and sign the offer acceptance. everyone I know had special consideration when they bought a home, time off to sign this or that, i've had no such luck. They've (and by they I mean the evil management duo) really made an important event in my life difficult.  after today, I will have 3 more weeks of stats class. I got my mid term results back, and I managed to get 100%, so that's 30 percent of my final grade assured. I am so pleased. I just can't loose focus, its so easy to get lost in that class. but the teacher is a sweetheart, and I'm almost there.  so back to my favourites: favourite type of chips: cheddar 'flavoured' sun chips  yum.

      Saturday the BF and I saw a condo in verdun. it was quite nice, although a little too close to a busy metro and a busy street. it seemed like a disappointment to the BF I was not interested, and it looked like perhaps the two of us would do poorly trying to agree on a place. But Sunday we went to a place the BF saw earlier in the week and I adored it. We decided we wanted it. The agent had us at the table ready to sign a promise to purchase within minutes. I think I was hyperventilating, and the BF looked petrified. we asked for a day to discuss with family and friends before signing a legally binding document. then, out of nowhere, the stress passed, and I realized it was something I really wanted to do. the time seemed right and sharing it with BF felt perfectly right. and so, Monday, we sat down and signed many many legal documents for our first home. we take possession in September. there's not enough time to be excited, since the stress of mortgage, inspector, wrapping RRSPs, and downpayments are whizzing by us at light speed. the next couple weeks will be rough. I did not envision researching notaries this week.   so, a moment to brag: its gorgeous. its near a metro to get to work, but not too close. it has a huge kitchen, and 2 bathrooms. its near atwater market, and is in an area thats a good mix between residential and urban. I really want to gush more but every second I waste describing it takes from my myriad of phone calls and faxes that need to be done yesterday. of course, I will gab more in detail in another update.

      friday evening, 20 minutes before leaving for a long weekend, I found myself in a sametime sparring match with my manager. I guess you could argue that I was the loser from the start, but I felt it was time to defend myself. He blamed me for another person's action that was not even on my team, and when I said I was tired of being blamed for actions that were unrelated to me, he got pissed.it was an emotional confrontation, I had a lot of angst built up. This lead me to think my weekend would be full of worry over my status at my company. Needless to say, I went home and wrote out every confrontation I've had with him and made copied of the sametime messages so that I would be prepared in the case that HR needs to get involved. its Monday, and evil manager is still out of town till next Monday, so I'm laying low. I also reviewed my CV,and although I am happy with it, I am concerned about the opportunities out there for Siebel folk.  work is such a large chunk of your life, I feel so discouraged that the politics of such a small office have me so weighed down. I really need to figure this one out, my mood in general is contingent on the atmosphere at work. I wish I cared less.

      i have a request for my few readers out there. i am reading great expectations and it's made me realize i want to catch up on classics that I may have missed over the years. please add a comment, list a few good oldies worth reading to give me some ideas. i just ordered oliver twist to read next, but I want some opinions for the next batch i pick up. i'm interested in both american classics and general classics, so give me some ideas!  Favourite book suggested by a friend: The Wasp Factory.  holy cow, that was a surprising read. i don't know what i expected, but that wasn't it! i know its not deemed a 'classic' but its a big of a ground breaker for me.

      again, the weather is dreary. I find myself having to pull up the collar of my jean jacket when I venture outdoors, its darn cold out there on top of being grey and rainy. Its a real mood setter.   a best friend of my fathers died a couple days back and I feel so much sympathy towards everyone involved. It was a tough bout with throat cancer that almost seemed beat, when other cancerous tumors were found. It breaks my heart to hear how painful and emotional it was for both him and those that cared for him. It's the third time in my life I've been privy to the terrible process of cancer, and I can honestly say I don't know if I could be so brave as to deal with the medication, and suffering that is involved in those last stages. Writing about it now depresses me. It certainly has to do with the helplessness, it's not like its within our control how these things occur, its a bit of a scary black hole to me. And I am always at a lack of words when I wish I could say the right thing....  today has been weird. Work is medium paced, which is just right for me right now. The mortgage was approved, but now they want even more signatures, more forms, more faxes, another amendment to the promise to purchase, blah, blah blah. Our landlord is not letting us out of our lease (apartment anyone? Nice bright 4 1/2 available in sept!) so we have to do the leg work ourselves to reassign the lease for September, normally not a big deal, but the rental market isn't what it was 2 years ago, it may be difficult to unload it for September. I'm really grumpy, and I'm already wondering if it's my new pill, alesse, that's kicking in. Any ladies on alesse out there? any advice please? I'm really pissy, but oddly, not tearful. Just darn tootin' angry all the time for about 2 days straight. Even a hot chocolate didn't help...I really wish having a smoke was an option. I can't remember when I quit, but it feels like forever ago...

      During some window shopping over lunch with Glen I happened a upon little gem of an item (man, am I bad at puns or what?), the Jem DVD box set!   I must have it! I played with jem dolls for years and absolutely wanted to dye my hair white and paint a green lightning bolt down my eye lid and cheek like Roxy. I wanted neon pumps, and awesome keyboard guitars and to wear zebra print. Forget barbie, the misfits were so cool. The dolls were practically flat chested, an inspiration to us mammary challenged gals.  but at a whopping 79 bucks, its hard to justify to myself. I realize it will not live up to my expectations, things like G.I. Joe and V the series were huge disappointments so many years later. Its cool that it made it to DVD at all, there must be other girls out there with the same soft spot. I hope it sells well, so that the last 20 episodes make it onto a second DVD (I know, I am a big loser for knowing that only two thirds of the episodes are on the box set)  favourite afterschool cartoon of my youth: Jem  favorite character:  Roxy, with Jetta as a close second.  favourite hunky male: Riot (sorry to the Rio fans, he was a bit of a wiener when you think about the fact he had the hots for jem and jerricka, that dog!)

      Its pouring out there today. Its June 1st, and I have to ask, where the hell is our summer? Spring was late, and I am highly doubtful we'll be getting decent weather this week. How dreary.   work is strangely quiet. I know as soon as things get in order work will pile up again, but I am taking full advantage of a quiet spell, to organize my files, clean up my inbox and desktop. For me, free time at work = organization time. I can't help it.  the new condo plans are at a bit of a standstill. The mortgage broker is dealing with our future mortgage bank, bank of mtl, and they are taking their sweet time to prove that there is indeed a property that exists so that they can finalize the mortgage approval. Its been over one week, which is really slow when you consider how fast all of these pieces have to come together. Its making me crazy and edgy. I am trying to restrain myself from calling twice a day to avoid harassing anyone, but who am I kidding, before this is over, I'm bound to verbally harass someone.  the BF has asked that from now on he be referred to as Glen in my blog. I thought I was respecting his privacy in a round about way, but alas, he doesn't think it necessary, so I will do what he asks. Or maybe I'm still playing a shell game and his real name is Lester :-)

      Yesterday I was tasked with writing a small bio for the company intranet site. These things are always harder than they seem for me. Anyway, here's my company bio:   My name is *** *** and I am based in the Montreal office. I am a Siebel developer and also the technical team lead for development on ***. I work directly with the system analysts, development team, and administrators to co-ordinate and participate in Siebel configuration and development.  My experience lies in Siebel development and configuration. For the last 4 years I have worked on a number of Siebel projects at ***, and previously at ****. I have participated in various upgrades, migrations and maintenance releases. Prior to that, I have worked with FoxPro and Powerhouse. Originally I enrolled in university for a Psychology degree, but changed directions mid way to obtain a technical Progam analyst college degree instead.   When I am not working, I spend my time going to university part time to get a completely unrelated Arts degree, learning new cooking techniques and trying to convince people that hedgehogs make cute pets.   Yes, I'm a wheezer, I commented out the names of the companies. I say stupid things here, so I may as well atleast distort the direct line to the place I work, self preservation if you will.

      I picked up the new PJ Harvey CD yesterday, and my vote is still out on what I think of it. It's more reminiscent of her older stuff, loud, rough around the edges, well half of it anyway. The problem is, I loved her last album, and I kinda hoped it would follow on that vein. She collaborated with Thom yorke on that last one, it was delicious. I will give it a chance, some albums take time to grow on you. I must note, she thanked Vincent Gallo on the special thanks section and dedicated a song to him. I can only imagine in my craziest dreams, a conversation between the two of them.  Favourite angst filled, angry song: 'Rid of me' by PJH.  When I'm in a foul mood, it hits the spot.

      Last night I finished 'great expectations'. It was slow going, not because I did not enjoy it, but simply because time was difficult to come by. It was enjoyable, and I hope to pick up some more dickens again soon. I think tonight I will start the great Gatsby. I had bought that one ages ago, but the ex stole it (that's right, you thief). Glen has another copy, so I'm going to give that one a go.  yesterday I lugged my ass to class only to find out it was cancelled. The young students rejoiced, but I was a bit miffed that I went all the way there for nothing. Glass half empty, I guess.  I got an email invite to a party a few days back by Mona, and I really wish I could have gone, but it was too last minute and I couldn't manage it. The theme: ladies dressed up in their old prom or bridesmaid dresses doing karaoke. It sounds like a blast, I wish I could have been there, and taken pictures! Mona - if you happen to read my blog, let me know how it went! Any digital pics?  at work its stop and go. To fill my free time, I have been appliance shopping on the web. Its strange, I never thought I'm be excited by purchasing a range, but since I've started to enjoy cooking, its now quite fun to research this kind of stuff. washers and dryers I could do without...I hope glen loves washing as much as I love cooking ...bwahh!! funny stuff.  I think I will now divert my attention to the foodtv.com website, I am addicted to recipe searching.  favourite recipe found on the web: pasta with a pumpkin, sage and sausage sauce.  savory, hearty, absolute comfort food. Makes me drool. Its a Rachel ray recipe on foodtv.com should anyone be interested.

      For those bored folks reading my blog, glen has pointed out to me that Alton brown, the guy with the show 'good eats' has a cute bog and web site. Worth perusing, I got a kick out of the Martha Stewart entry.  Tara - if you're reading today, I got your email and I wrote you back. I am peeved, my email at work is still kicking out personal emails, I guess its time I accepted the facts and started checking my yahoo account more often.  favourite new past time: talking gibberish to my new fish, Fish-O.  he was formally known as Seabowl (as in siebel) the office betta fish, but one late night i snuck out of the office with him, and i think he enjoys his new home and name much better.

      I took a sick day yesterday which did wonders for my mental state. Nice and refreshed.   school is winding down, I have 2 weeks of class left, with an assignment to be returned tonight. Nerdy nervous energy is at a high.   work has been odd. The big evil project is over, with some remaining caveats and management is bidding on new work to try and prevent an evil consultant group from getting our work instead. I am a bit of a bystander right now, and I'm not sure if its a good or a bad thing.  glen and I are stuck trying to find people to rent out place as I have said, and so far we have two applications handed in. I am desperate to hear either one is acceptable, I need this stuff to be settled so I can feel a sense of completion. So much to do to buy a place, people really don't exaggerate.  glen has convinced me to join him at the Ottawa jazz fest on July 4th to see the bad plus. I'm a willing travel companion (I never go anywhere, so I'll take any opportunity) even if I feel rather unfazed by the band. Anyway, a day outside at a music festival sounds fun.  I apologize, these entries feel a lot like summaries these days, and I guess they are. I don't get to update as often as I'd like so I cram in a lot of unrelated crap into one blog entry. Bare with me, once I am poor and living in my own home, I will have much more time to write prettier entries.

      The lease to our apt has been reassigned! Rejoice! One less responsibility for the move. We measured to condo the other day and I was able to get answer for the hard hitting questions I have been badgering Glen about for way too long; will she leave the built ins for the closets? Is the stove a built in? How big is the fridge? blah blah blah. I think I embrace the opportunity to organize too much.  well, my stats class in done. I trucked through that class and was quietly pleased with myself for doing so well, and then last nights exam threw me for a loop. For fifty percent of my grade I completely blew a six point question. I was so fustrated with myself, especially when I got home and realized I had tried out the correct way to do the problem and ERASED it. I am such a moron. So now my easy A is in jeopardy. I'll be praying to the grade gods it you need to find me... The good news of being free from evening classes has been overshadowed by my idiotic exam effort, here's hoping I get my grade soon so I can accept my fate and move on.  after the exam I was feeling dejected, so I consoled myself with a donut and a coffee, I can't keep my hands off fat. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips should be my mantra to get me into diet mode, but I am so weak when faced with food. But I have a plan!! Next Monday I have reserved a lesson at rock climbing club to have a beginner lesson. Since my evenings are free, I thought I'd try something new and get some exercise. I hope I like it, I really want an activity that tricks me into exercising because I'm having so much fun. Like squash, I LOVE squash, but so does everyone else in Montreal, and they are not only way better than me, they also reserved all available courts to prevent access. Oh yeah, and squash club access is mucho expensive.

      In class yesterday I stared at the butt crack of a girl a few rows up and contemplated weight loss. She was wearing low cut jeans with no underwear and she had serious plumber ass going on. The butt cleavage she was displaying made me think of my own body that I am not as happy with as I could be. a healthy body is totally within my grasp, but I lack initiative. well, that arse crack has inspired me. I never want someone to ponder over my bottom as they consider negative body image. I've been able to stop with the cigarettes, so I guess the next step to self betterment is to get back on the weight management. I have the summer coming, and no university classes to account for, so I have the time. Am I inspired to exercise? No. Do I want to eat healthier? No. But maybe those decision will get easier once I get started. I need a plan...  If only I wasn't scared of my old Tae Kwon Do master, I'd go back there and get some serious exercise. Its the only exercise I really enjoyed, but the pressure to compete was too strong, and I was always sick to my stomach about another impending belt test.   Little known fact: I am a purple belt in Tae Kwon do.   For you folks that are not up to date on your TKD belts, that only halfway to Black belt. They were always introducing new colours; white, yellow, orange, green, purple, brown, red, dan bo (red and black) and black. And for the record, the white belt does not signify a skill level, as my teacher said, its only to hold you pants up. but the average age of most TKD students is 18 and I feel a little over the hill to join up so I'll just have to keep looking for an activity to try. Something with more punching...

      I neglected to mention the fine dining experience glen and I had this weekend. We went to Le Pegase for dinner with friends on Saturday. Its a French resto, and a BYOW. You have a choice of numerous, meat plentiful, 4 course meals. Its located in the plateau, in a quaint renovated house. My meal consisted of a appetizer of scallops in a wine cream sauce within a phylo pastry, a cream of broccoli and almond soup, the entree was duck l'orange and a profiterole for desert. Combined with 2 bottles of excellent wine, I was pleasantly plump with food. I can't tell you how much I love going out to eat and trying new restaurants. I am a self proclaimed 'foodie'.   Perhaps a bold statement, but I must state that Montreal has some of the best restaurants, with the exception of France. Now, I am only limited to the places in the world I have been: France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, and in North America; Chicago, New York, New Jersey, Toronto, Quebec City, and Ottawa. Of course, I could not afford to go to the best restos in NY, but pound for pound, MTL stands firm as one of the best places to dine. When I chose a vacation spot nowadays, I often think about what the food will be like, for two main reasons. First, I've been a picky eater all my life, so I'm always scoping to ensure I have a few options on any menu, and second, the food was so bad in Amsterdam that I will, in the future, weigh in the local cuisine when picking a place to go.

      I stumbled upon a sale at R&W and bought some new office garb. I received my package from Amazon, conating my survivor season 1 dvd, and a great looking italian cookbook. I was told that I can have 2 days off for my move as compensation for overtime I've already done, leaving my personal days and vacation untouched.  I received in the mail my latest issue of my subscription to everyday food.  I am going to the condo with Glen tonight to measure our new house, how exciting is that?

      Ok, so the six feet under premiere was Sunday. I won't put any spoilers here, but I will say I'm glad to see some new episodes. I really enjoy most of the characters (except Nate, he's such a martyr) and the dialogue. What a profoundly better show that the sopranos. It's the only show I am following on TV right now, other than the NBA finals, which will be over soon enough. For the record, I just want any team to beat the lakers, it doesn't matter which one. go Pistons!  I ordered the survivor first season on dvd from amazon. I only started watching the show in the last 2 episodes of the first season, so I basically missed out on the best season of the show, so says everyone, everywhere. I really dig having a season of anything on dvd; the ability to watch something you like in digestible bit size portions whenever you want is fun. I can't wait to get it.  a question: what is out there on tv land that I should be watching? Any suggestions? ah, maybe its best I don't get addicted to new TV shows, I wasted over 10 hours of my life on the swan (although I was gratified that the chick I predicted to win, did. I realize how deranged it is that I watched it, but it was fascinating)

      This weekend I found myself on the corner of crescent and de maisonneuve in the middle of the grand prix insanity. now, I am not a fan, but we met up with some friends, and one of them is a regular patron at this place, so we wrangled balcony seats to watch the concert and do some drunken people watching. I commented, mostly to myself, that one of the F1 bimbos had some camel toe action going on, which some drunken strangers overheard and started hollering at the girls. I guess camel toe is a selling point for some people. (if you don't know what camel toe is, ask around..heheh) anyway, it was a fun time. Watching rich old men and their slutty gals is high entertainment.  and for the record, 31$ is way too much for a pitcher of sangria.

      wahhh...I'm so sad. I decided I had to go back into my blog archives and remove a few of my work related rants. Nothing incriminating, but bitching about it publicly is probably not a good idea. You see, I was told about some moron at work here that was fired because they discovered his blog which details his pissing in his bosses coffee mug. Messed up stuff. There are no confessions of that type to be found here in my blog, in fact I find what he did to be extremely immature and offensive, but I decided that whining about political maneuvering in my company may not help. So, my archives are about 5 entries lighter.  I find self censoring is the hardest thing to do. I've written extremely honest and emotional blogs about my concerns with my family and thought better of posting them after all. Its not so much about protecting myself but trying no to hurt anyone in the process of venting. When I was younger it would not have even occurred to me that other people would be affected by my comments, but I fancy the idea that I have evolved a bit since then.   it any case, perhaps this blog will be a little easier to digest with a little less crazy ranting about the goings on in my office.

      I find myself with nothing to do today. My shoulders are now full of pain from climbing/belaying and I have run out of things to look at on the web. I am now an appliance expert, I could be an appliance consultant if I wanted to.   I am not being a good girl and refraining from spending like I am suppose to. At lunch glen and I went to the gap and I ended up buying a polo shirt from the men's section, made from a terry cloth type material in a nice forest green. I dig men's clothes because they hit at the appropriate length for me. I find women's tops are always so short and my gut is always exposed. That was ok when I was 16 but I need to tuck that thing in now out of decency for myself and others. Seriously its hard to get tops that are not button up dress tops that fit me. Of course this is not due to my naturally long torso or anything of the sort, but rather a touch of sway back that causes me to arch my back and stick my tummy forward. When I consciously straighten up you can see a real difference, but it is a big effort to do so.   I went to an osteopath briefly but found it of little help. Not the whole profession, but the osteopath I saw was a bit too distracted for my taste, for the major expense of seeing an osteo, I think they should spend 100% of the time you reserved, with you, not finishing off another client or prepping a new client near the end of your session.  more miscellaneous drivvel:  I did not vote in the demerger referendum for Montreal.  I am currently a citizen of westmount about to move to Verdun, the way I see it I am moving from the over privileged to the under privileged, so I don't want to add my vote to the have's instead of the have-nots. I will vote for the federal election.   I am currently watching survivor season one on dvd. a lot of fun to see a slightly more raw season.   I am reading Dropped Threads by various women authors (Canadian?). So far I find it a little dull, but I have hopes it will pick up.   I have decided to invest in some climbing gear and take up wall climbing

      Every muscle in each of my fingers are sore from yesterdays rock climbing lesson. It was fantastic. It was scary and challenging and I am eager to go back. glen and I partnered up and I cannot emphasize enough how scared I was to belay him. When it was time for him to let go and come down, I was too afraid to let the cord slip, and I held on instead of feeding the rope so he could lower down, the effect of that was finding myself floating in the air in a very uncomfortable harness. We both made it out of the lesson intact and with approval to climb on our own. Neat.

      I have a rock climbing lesson today. After receiving the MEC catalogue last Thursday, glen and I talked about rock climbing and I became curious. I wanted a new activity and here's my chance! I called a place on Friday and booked a lesson for today. I'm excited, I hope I can get my brain around all the knot tying and end up with a potential new activity, I need some exercise in a big way. The thing is, if I was a slow learner when I was a kid to tie my shoes, is that a bad sign? I guess I'll know soon enough. Glen is going to join me. He's got climbing experience, but I need an anchor, and I think he'll do fine.  another reason today is a good day: I work tomorrow and then I have 5 days off. woo hoo. long weekend. I booked a company paid massage for Wednesday and I have no other plans but to relax. Now I just need things to go smoothly until then at work. Oh, and wait for my grade in my stats class which I royally screwed up.

      Friday night glen and I went for the BEST souvlaki at Villa de Souvlaki on Sherbooke. Just a year ago, I still unacquainted with taziki sauce, but now that I've got a fever for the flavour, I doubt I will return to kojax souvlaki again. Later that night we met up with my brother and his wife and we went to the west island to catch a movie. We ended up seeing 'Saved!' which was cute but I thought it would be a much darker comedy than it was. Macaulay Culkin was cute in it though, in his awkward kind of way.  Saturday morning was a clean-a-thon for glen and I, since we haven't cleaned the place in weeks. Its was laborious but I'm glad its done. It reminded me how much crapola I have, and that I ought to get rid of some stuff before we move.  after the scouring and soaking, we went to la ronde. Its been a couple years for me, and a bit longer for glen, and I think it was a fun time. We went on all the big rides, and I have to admit that with a little bit of age behind me, I'm a bit more nervous than I use to be. The best part was the bungee ride called the slingshot. Basically glen and I get strapped into a big ball which is attached to two poles the height of an apartment building by metal cords. Once the cords are full of tension the ball is let go and we are slingshot into the sky. Once you stretch out as far as the cords will go, the ball is forced back towards the ground at a really high speed which is even more scary since you can see the people you are hurdling towards. Even better than my explanation is this link:  urlLink slingshot!   anyway, I was extremely nervous, after paying the extra cash to go on it I found myself in a panic just before it was our turn. Its exhilarating, and the pressure in your face is surprising! The intensity of the propulsion was great but when we were rocking slowly back and forth while waiting to be lowered down to the ground I felt panicky again. i am such a weezer. The rest of the rides were a piece of cake after that one. We also caught the firework competition while we were there. All in all, a fun day.  fathers day involved a breakfast with glens folks and a BBQ dinner with my family. In between we did some appliance window shopping. The search has been a little disappointing so far. Too much money, not the right colour, not the right match, etc. fustrating stuff. I think we will be opting for a fridge and range that are not part of a set.

      Today's lunch break found me addressing some grooming and shopping needs. After a tasty meatball sub at subway, I scampered off to have my monthly hair extraction. Once my bikini line and legs from the knees down were nice and hairless, I decided I have neglected to buy my bottom something in a long time. In the Bays lingerie section I discovered these AWESOME (they deserve description in capital letters) Calvin Klein undies. Soft stretchy microfiber with no seams in amazing colours and a great bikini cut that is a little low but not plumber ass crack kinda low. and 30% off to boot!! So I helped myself (and realize I am aware I am buying a house and I should not be spending the moola) to 6 pairs, 4 bikini style in black, hot pink, white and orange and 2 in a thong version in black and blue. Gorgeous colours, my butt will be pleased. Have you bought your bum a treat lately? (insert joke here, I know how easy it will be to come up with one after a line like that)  Now I know what some may think - those aren't sexy undies, have I accepted defeat, and switched over to the granny pants? yes and no. I think they are a different kind of sexy. no, its not lace or see through mesh, but that's so frilly and impractical. Those are useful for the naughty special events, but these are just cute and comfortable, and can be worn without irritation during exercise. So no, I haven't gotten rid of the lingerie goodies (everyone breathe a sign of relief for Glen) but I am accepting a new undies phase in my life.   and speaking of bums: The opening sequence of lost in translation was a long shot of scarlett johansson's butt in some filmy cotton undies. speaking from a purely straight girl angle, she's got a fine bottom. Apparently the underwear were a one of a kind pair made exclusively for her, for the movie intro, commissioned by Sophia Coppola. Anyway, since then, many women have clamored for those underwear (and to have an ass that looks like scarlett johansson's), so now they will sell them for like 60$ US a pop.

      Willy Wonka Lik-M-Aid - remember those?  Its a paper pouch with 3 sealed sections. One section for a candy stick which you lick and insert into one of the other 2 sections to cover it in candy powder that is flavoured like orange, lime, grape, cherry, etc.   I learned through experimentation that the powder does not make kool-aid and that after enough sugar crystal consumption my taste buds on my tongue would become pronounced and sore. Having said that, cherry and lime were my favourite flavours.

      Does anyone else out there think that Porky Pig in the cartoon Duck Dodgers looks adorable in his little space suit? I'm not a porky pig fan, I was always more of a Daffy Duck or Wile E. Coyote supporter, but the space suit he wears and the cute faces he makes in Duck Dodgers just makes me giggle.  Glen and I were discussing cartoons of our youth the other day and I have been thinking about the bits and pieces of shows that have stayed with me. I was never a Walt Disney kid, and I never wanted to be Cinderella. Man, did I hate Jerry of Tom & Jerry, why couldn't the cat ever win? I have grown to enjoy the Bugs Bunny character over the years, but initially I was always in huge support of Wile E. Coyote, Sylvester and Daffy Duck. Glen and I also discussed the Hanna Barbara cartoons, and I have to point out this is where we differ completely. I do not think the flintstones had any redeeming qualities. Yes, I realize the tongue in cheek aspect to it, but it was repetitive (not in the same way looney tunes was) and the nuclear family aspect with the gender roles is completely unrelatable to me. I have a theory - it's an age gap thing. I wager that people under 30 just don't get the humour of the flintstones. I'm sure it will be the same with the simpsons eventually, but I can't sit through an entire episode of the flintstones, or any of the Hanna Barbara shows for that matter.  and I think mike Meyers was right - bugs bunny dressed up in drag as that girl bunny was kinda sexy

      Ha ha! Suckers! We did it, a unanimous effort of technical skill and in some cases manual intervention that's a bit embarrassing*, but the data load we needed to get done is finished!! A day off can be enjoyed by all! Crisis averted.  *yes computer wonks, I spent 15 minutes with my finger on the left mouse button stepping on/off records in order to activate them in the database. The reason is when data gets entered in the db, the records are written only to base tables, not to the 1:1 extension table, since the initial load doesn't write to the implicit 1:1 table. In order to update values stored on this table, we need to step on a record which forces the application to create the extension table, since stepping off a record is similar to a write record event. After all the records have their extension table created, sql can be run against it. ta da!

      I've been submerged in a development nightmare for the last two days, and I am trying desperately to find my way out of it so I can have July 1st off like the rest of Canada. It sucks when a technical problem cannot be fixed or a solution found. We found a workaround and I feel a tad unsatisfied that we never discovered the source of the problem. And in the deeper recesses of my brain I was happy looking at technical issues again, I felt like I was flexing some brain muscle - too bad I wasn't able to fix the problem.  Let's see, I need some balance here. Good news: I got an A in my Stats class. I'm grinning right now over it. An 'A'. That brings my WGPA to a nice 3.157 which means its time to apply for honours. Every time I see my WGPA I think about how my grades from when I first visited university in 97 are bringing me down. My lowest grade in sociology classes so far is an A-, my GPA since entering the program is 3.99. stupid psychology courses. But I guess the only way to look at is that its 24 credits done that I do not have the time to redo in hopes of a better average.

      Yesterday was my bi-annual hoo hoo poke session. For those folks that don't understand my unsophisticated jargon, its my twice a year colposcopy. I'm sure a few ladies out there are familiar with it. Its what happens when abnormal cells are found on your cervix. First you get to go to a cold hospital and wait for ages even though you have an appointment. Then you get naked from the waist down with a tissue sized paper to cover you and...Wait some more. Then the doctor comes in, tells you conflicting info from the last time you were there, and then the excitement begins. Bleeding! Vinegar! Discomfort! All on a computer screen for you to see, at a 10X magnification! Even more intriguing is knowing I've been intimate with a Karl Zeiss lens...gerrrowl..Hot! Anyway, this time I got away with no biopsy taken, and romantic date set for 6 months from now. And I get to call back in three short weeks to see if my results have changed. funny, in this scenario, I'm not calling anymore to find out 'is everything ok?' the assumption is no, its not, I'm merely calling to ensure its not less ok than it was 6 months earlier. Come on - I can't be the only person that sees this as a glass half empty situation, am I? Maybe I'm just a big baby, but after a morning like that, I feel obliged to complain, its not just a right, but a duty.

      And it's probably way too boring to read. What I've been up to in point form:   Had a super massage at Tonic with Christine. Damn she's good.   Went to Al dente in the monkland village for dinner with my aunt. Tasty.    Spazed when a cute little dog pissed in my shopping bag while I was sitting on some stairs on monkland enjoying my day off.   Had eggs over easy for the first time. yum, thanks Glen.   Played squash and suffered extreme muscular pain because of it.   When comparison shopping for climbing gear at la Cordee.   Went for a club sandwich in the gay village on the way back from La Cordee. Despite the reviews, I rate it as average.   Saw chronicles of riddick. ho ho, that was bad. 'it's an animal thing' heheh   Made Chinese five spice glazed duck breast for dinner, and a zesty roasted red pepper soup, not bad if I don't say so myself.   Decided on a fridge/stove with glen for the new condo.   Had dinner with friends.   Had breakfast and dinner with family and family in law.   Saw a lot of ass cheek due to the Shed's new uniform change. Mini red skirts and way too much butt around my espresso allonge.   Watched six feet under.   Checked 20 times to see if my statistics grade was posted.   I made absolutely no headway with my plans to start a new diet, but I ate well, drank too much wine and got some exercise.  today's plan: get through the work day, pick up my clinique goods I ordered and the neat freebies that come with it, and go vote for the federal election.

      I need the collective will of the readers of this blog (you know, all 3 of you) to mentally force the bank of Montreal to call me already. The clock is ticking, we are making the moving details, so why won't they call me? Its so frustrating when anyone says, 'I'll call you' because I'm a god damn control freak I don't want to wait for you to call. Sending 'call now' vibes to BMO with mental telepathy skills is just not working...argh. I guess I was only blessed with the super powers of acoustically perfect belching and facial mime techniques. yep, I'm a charmer.  oh! oh! look, i finally learned how to spell 'frustrating'. its NOT fustrating, which is how i like to spell and pronounce it. maybe i'll give the correct way a try, but i make no promises.

      Yesterday glen and I went to allez up to get our membership cards and climb for the first time since getting new equipment. On my first climb I lost my grip and fell, slamming my elbow into the sandpaper-like wall on the way down. ouchie. Its the first scabby elbow I've had since I was 14 years old. Feels good in that know you are alive kind of way. I'm a big suck though, I only felt comfortable on the 5.4 route, its for babies really. Glen did this 5.7 route and I was excited watching him puzzle it out, maybe I'm get there eventually. I think the routes are coded as 5.4 (easy) through 6.x (tough). To my credit, I am afraid of heights, so this is a bit of a leap of faith for me to attempt. In fact, I am pretty much operating on adrenaline when I'm climbing over a certain height. Like over 6 feet...heh.  on a special note, my friend Tara who lives in Calgary is in Montreal for a visit and tonight I am preparing dinner for her and her man squeeze...muh hah hah ha. It will be really nice to she her (let me take this opportunity to lament her moving away in the first place...I know, I know, its whatever makes you happy that counts, but I miss the drinks together and the chats). AND I get to meet her boyfriend, I am so curious to meet the guy, I'm guessing he's a smartie. And so, to honour her visit,  glen and I will drag out the monstrous 1.5 L bottle of Rothschild merlot so we can drink and be merry.yum. and, appearing for dinner for the first time will be Cajun seafood pasta. I know I shouldn't try out new recipes on guests, but if it sucks I promise I will order pizza. And then perhaps a little partaking of the jazz fest? ivana santilli is playing on the free stage tonight, that would be fun to catch, she was enjoyable a couple years back when she came last.

      At 4.30 am this morning, glen and I got a crank call. The guy left a message when we did not answer in time. It was obscence and he used my name and my mothers. It freaked me out. How did they know my mothers name? Glen *69'd and we got a number. I was in a rage, and nervous that this person had personal info so I called back directly. (I have had a few crank callers in my life and I always feel pretty unsettled) the guy answered and mumbled incoherently about vaginas and pussies, until I finally realized I was not going to find any vindication for having the nerve to call back. When I was almost back to sleep, he called back again, and had the audacity to ask if he woke me up, and then mumbled some more about vaginas. fuck, I hate men and their crank calls, always about vaginas, never something original like feet or ears. It was a pretty restless sleep, and I decided to call my mother to tell her. Surprisingly, the story gets more complicated, because she had calls as well, and they realized after the 14th call that the number was from my fathers cell phone. My dad went out to his car to find the phone stolen, the windows smashed and his briefcase stolen. No money or personal items taken. This guy called my mom, my aunt, me and possibly other lucky ladies. My mother is afraid to call my grandmother to find out if she had a call about vaginas at 4.30 in the morning. So much for having a restful sleep, it seems like an impossible feat. People can be so mean spirited, it amazes me. My parents are so upset about the whole thing, and its hard to console them, when strangers invade your personal life in such a crass way, its a real violation. Besides, no need to call and harass me about hoo hoos when I dish out that info regularly on my blog. Idiot.

      Evil dead the musical was a hoot. It was better than I expected and I'm glad I went. Perhaps more fun than the rocky horror picture show... what was weird about the occasion was that I ran into two friends of the ex boyfriend, both attending the show separately. One of the guys, I'll call him high_maintenance, is pissed off at me for the funniest reason, so he gave me the cold shoulder. I was on the bus one early morning heading to work and I saw my friend don, so we talked a bit, and when the bus pulled up at the last stop, I saw high_maintenance for the first time as he emerged from his seat and got off. He later told the ex that he was mad at me for not talking to him....um, well, why didn't he say hi to me if he saw me? So when I saw him yesterday he held his nose high in the air to show his disdain for me, and I did not take the bait, I was not apologizing. Sorry high_maintenance, but keeping friends as you get older has to be dealt with a little more maturely.  The other guy I saw, I'll call him gentle_giant, was there with his long time girlfriend. I think he's a sweetheart, and I must admit I was a little sad when I broke up with the ex and realized that he did not want to be on friendly terms with me anymore, even after 6 years of spending enormous amounts of time together. I am also a little wounded that his girlfriend will not say more than a few words to me. Back when we hung out a lot I busted my ass trying to get her to talk, I practically did a tap dance and song in front of her to bond, but no luck. Its weird when you spend almost 2 years of evenings at a coffee shop and someone never makes you feel like they want to be there. Anyway, she's polite enough, but I take it as a failure of sorts I wasn't able to penetrate the armor. These guys, and their gals, were my 'people' for 6 years of my life, and its so weird to be in a room together at separate tables like strangers. That's the way it goes, but it feels so strange. There's so many other people involved in a two person relationship. I still miss my ex's family, they are good people. I have a hard time making new bonds with people (my own fault I realize) so the loss of people in my life is acute. Good buddies like Tara, Natasha, Melanie and Alicia have all moved away from Montreal, and it saddens me. I don't make efforts to immerse myself into new social surroundings but I guess it needs to be done. On that note, I guess I better stop talking to myself via blog entry. I need to find some Montreal dwelling, feminist, twenty something gals with interests in politics, drinking and a whole lot of yapping.

      Like pennies from heaven, Glen's friend Nanci gave him 4 free tickets to Evil Dead the Musical for this evening. If you're up to date with my blog ( urlLink Scary Stuff Part I ), you know my brother and I are huge horror film buffs, and Evil Dead is by far one of the most important flicks of that genre. Its campiness must lend well to a comedy musical. I was contemplating going but the just for laughs festival tickets are not cheap, and I wasn't sure if it would be any good. But free tickets to something you actually want to see is so cool, usually I only end up with free tickets to really bad movies. Should be fun, and if not, it's still free! yay Nanci

      This past weekend was a non stop spend fest. Glen and I rented a car and zoomed around town scattering money wherever we went.  First stop Friday evening was the Brick where we got our fridge, range, washer, dryer and a spontaneous purchase of a 32' television. teehee, xbox will be so much cooler now. All goodies to be delivered on moving day. After spending way too much money (Visa though so too, I got a security call in order to verify my purchase) we went to have a  uniquely quebecois dining experience at lafleurs. OMG, their Michigan hot dogs are awesome. Before heading home we to the observation deck on mount royal, a place I have not been to since I was 10 years old - it was really pretty. I need to do more touristy things and discover my own city more often. Saturday we waded through highway traffic and construction to go to ikea, and spent scads of money on crap all. We then raced to the other end of the 40 to go to the mountain equipment co-op (MEC) to buy me a super duper new climbing harness and ity bity climbing shoes. I am psyched to go climbing as soon as humanly possible, maybe tomorrow if we can manage it. I'm soooo excited! Once we got home I tried out a new recipe, Asian marinated flank steak. Basically I marinated a massive flank steak in sesame oil, white wine, rice wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, salt and pepper and then put it in the broiler (fact: westmount by-laws say no BBQs for westmount apartment dwellers. Ciao westmount). I sliced the med-rare steak into strips on a biase, and it was superb, (modest, who me?) a definite keeper. On Sunday we drove to Ottawa, and Glen bought himself a new climbing harness (another factoid: a harness is only good for 3 years or so, so replace those old ones or else!). Glen treated me to a cute Prana beenie for climbing, useful to tuck my hair away so there's no danger in catching it in the belay device or something. With a bit of time to spare I was able to make a trip to Venus envy at last. I bought (count 'em) two new toys. errr..umm....I am pleased (maybe another entry on that later). The main reason for going to Ottawa was to go to the Ottawa jazz fest. We went to see the Bad Plus. The audience area was dead empty (what a shock, having gone to the MTL jazz fest every year), we had a great view and it was fun. After a quick visit with glen's friend Troy (who has great taste in wine BTW) we drove home. We also watched a bit of the tour de France. We had switched one of our channels to the outdoor life network for the tour. I feel kinda depressed whenever some poor guy takes a spill though.  Now I'm back at work, earning money to pay for the weekends expenditures and actually busy. We have a release date next Monday, so its time to make sure everything is in the right place. It's good to be busy, pretending to be busy is harder work.

       while wondering around at lunch, I met a childhood friend, who works at a chocolate counter in a big department store. it was a pleasure to see her, and even more of a pleasure to interact with her. Being around her is hard to explain, she's younger than me, and while growing up I threw around my older status a lot, but in many ways I feel she's surpassed me in emotional maturity. I get a strange sensation around her, like I'm about to unwrap a Christmas present, like I'm excited about what she will do or say next. A few minutes into our discussion, she says she learned something really amazing, and pulls me aside in one of the aisles to tell me that playboy really does have good articles. It was hilarious and completely unexpected. Then she brought me over to her counter and gave me a bunch of chocolate samples (which were exceptional, BTW) and described each of them with affection and detail. I was smiling the whole time, it was like she had me in a spell. I really can't explain why she had this drug like effect on me. Then she told me about a course she was planning to teach, about understanding the self, holistic type stuff. Now, I don't really buy into it, but she's the second one of my friends lately that is on this empower and understand yourself kick, so I wanted to respect all she had to say. She's got the whole course planned out, and I swear, if she has the same effect on others as she does on me, she'll be a huge success. I said I was really happy for her that she sounded so happy with what she was doing and I wished I was doing something that made me happier. She told me to write down all the things that made me happy and try to find the link that I could turn into something I wanted to do. Why does it sound so easy coming from her? It made me laugh because she told me on the top of her happy list was chocolate! I think that would be somewhere high up on my list too. I left her counter because it was getting busy and I had to head back to work, but it was really great to see her. I think I will have to treat myself to some earl grey chocolate soon so I can pay her another visit.

       Glen just said that apparently they found Bobby Fisher in Japan, and are sending him back to the U.S. to be persecuted.  I haven't seen the article yet, but I am still baffled by the fact that they will persecute him for his political beliefs. Yeah, yeah treason, etc. The FBI assumed he was collaborating with the KGB because he wasn't pro U.S., and then he broke the UN prohibition of sports events in Yugoslavia. Ok, so he's a bit of a wacko, he's been quoted saying some crazy things about 9/11. But what exactly is he being charged with when he gets back to the U.S? Doesn't the FBI have bigger fish to try? Nuts to crack?   Is there more to this than I realize?&nbsp;honestly, first he refused to play a chess game in the soviet union, then he played an illegal game in Yugoslavia? big whoopie.

       I was mistaken, I still feel like crud. Maybe its the weather, or the lack or sleep, or the renewed level of stress I feel about the move, but I feel like poop. atleast I have a weekend with no responsibilities to look forward to. In the meantime, a dull entry.  Gord's appointment with the vet was interesting. I had some time to kill, so I took the bus there rather than taxi. Everyone on the bus was dying to know 'what was in the box!?'. People strained while trying to look casual to get a peek, but Gord was inside an oatmeal box in side another box, so it was pretty much impossible. The vet managed to only get the front paws trimmed, Gord rolled into a ball and stayed that way for the remainder of the visit. So, they charged me half price and now I am on a mission to find a stone or brick I can fit in his cage so that he can wear down his nails naturally.  after another refreshing dip in the pool, Glen and I went to the Clairmont for dinner. New owner, new look, new items on the menu! I use to really like the place, and I'm not a huge advocate of change, but its seems like they did well, even if they got rid of a few menu items I really liked. I decided to take advantage of the tapas menu to try scallop ceviche, which I've heard of a lot but never tried. Even though I knew what to expect, I was a bit appalled by the temperature and the texture (cold and jiggly) so I think I'll pass on it in the future. For me, its all about texture. I can't eat shrimp, mussels, or escargot for that reason...It makes me gag involuntarily, and no one wants that.  Ok, so now my take on the tour de France, which we have been watching religiously since ordering the outdoor life network. I do not understand. Why is Lance Armstrong going to win? Its been explained to me, blah blah, he's consistent, good on sprints and hills, but he's still in 9th position and no one seems nervous. I find watching him a little disappointing, he wants this win number 6 so badly, he takes no chances, which means he does nothing interesting. He's boring. Supposedly, today and tomorrow's races are the ones he's going to kick ass in. Here's hoping, I want to see some action.

      I am not the most informed person on American politics, but I do know that I am hopeful that the American population will decide its time for a positive change and vote Bush out of the office. Ok, so I'm a bleeding heart leftist, but how can we (and by we I mean Canada too, we are tied to the U.S. for better or worse, and I'd say perception of the U.S throughout the rest of the world is not so good right now) just allow things to go on?   Glen and I went to see Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 over the weekend, and I found some scenes truly painful to watch. I sobbed during footage of an Iraqi woman cursing the U.S. for killing much of her family, all of whom were civilians. There was so much pain, I couldn't help but imagine if troops came into a north American city and did the same. Human rights, a socially constructed phenomenon, seems to be defined by the nation with the most power, and they get to dictate when rights are violated or if they do not apply at all. Its sad, and it makes me shameful.  So, here's hoping Bush gets voted out, and that people like Michael Moore get trashed a little less. There was such a backlash against him after the award for bowling for columbine. I don't think his tactics are always graceful but I admire his efforts, it takes a lot of guts to go out there and contradict the powers that be.   urlLink Folks working towards a dubyah free U.S.

      Yesterday was one of those moody days that I find so hard to describe or explain. I realize its mostly due to getting my period and the hormones involved with that and the new pill I'm taking, but I wish I had an indicator for when I was going to feel like this (like the sugar test for diabetics).  we met with our account manager at the bank for our mortgage finally and she said we did not even have a file with the bank. Instant panic and anger on my part. She started trash talking our mortgage broker until I explained that we did have a file, I was certain, but that it may not be at the branch. She ended up finding it and then asked us why we were there. nevermind that the broker told us to expect a call from the bank that we never got, and that we were suppose to finalize details about payment and after signing with the bank that she says we technically already did, we basically waited 5 weeks to meet with the bank to find out we never had to. This process sucks. Its designed to confuse you, make you need a lawyer or notary to try and navigate through the muddled jargon and technicalities. in the afternoon I found myself doing data entry (and poorly I might add) for a customer who does not take no for an answer. I had no idea what to do (and I don't admit that all that often) and I was filled with anxiety about adding data to production that I was unsure of. glen's new position requires overtime more often, so a few times a week I end up leaving ahead of him. This means that a number of times I go get groceries on my own to make dinner. On this exceptionally moody day that pissed me off to no end, lining up for food, paying and dragging the bags home to make dinner. Cranky, cranky, cranky. To explain, we do not have a car, so groceries are a pain in the ass to begin with, we can't do monster loads of food at one time, so we often do mini trips to the store. So throw in a couple grocery bags, a bus ride, extremely hot and humid weather and my hormones and you've got one pissy girl. to alleviate some of the tension I was building, I went to the outdoor pool in our apartment. The water was wonderful, and I think it did wonders for my sanity. Oh, and a 1/2 bottle of red wine, that helps too. Today all the hormones seem to be back in their place. No instant rage at a moments notice for me, that was yesterday. Maybe that's a trait I need to add to my CV: Capable of 'Instant Rage' with occasional bouts of 'Crying for no Reason'. I guess I'm not doing much here to support my ideas on feminism, but to be fair, I am not saying I can excuse my behaviour, only that I wish I could understand it better. Rereading the events of yesterday, it seems like a pretty average day, only I was less equipped to handle it emotionally.  Note: For anyone interested in triggering my 'Instant Rage' (non hormonally induced), try calling me, or other women for that matter, 'Hysterical'. I HATE that word, its so misogynist it reeks. I'm sure there are a few people out there that may remember a fight I got into with a guy over the history and usage of that word. Yes smartypants, I do see the irony of my reaction and the definition of the word itself.

      Yesterdays release into production was a long ordeal but not as painful as these things have been in the past. I worked on it from noon to 11.30pm without so much as a break so I feel like I did what I could. The hard part is waiting to hear from our support team if any major issues crop up over the next couple days.   I noticed that gord, my main hedgehog, has a painful looking nail situation going on. I was told by the vet that I did not have to trim his nails, but after a few months it looks like not trimming was the wrong thing to do. His nails are turned inwards slightly and I can't help thinking I was stupid to believe it was fine. Now I have an appointment on Thursday to have his nails cut, and I know it will be a grueling endeavor, and I can bet it will require a sedative for the little guy. I'm feeling pretty guilty here, like a bad parent.  despite attempts to channel my mental will to force the bank to call me about my mortgage, I finally gave in and called the broker back, again, and insisted its been too long. Well, a few calls later and I have an appointment on Wednesday with the bank. Finally. phew. I can't wait to have these new condo details worked out. Yes, buying a first home with glen is fun, but there's a ton of administrative crap that does not get done all on its own. Over the last couple days we've booked the moving truck, made an appointment with the bank, consulted with the notary and talked with the current owner about buying some of her stuff (like the AC unit). I can't wait until we are moved in, I just hope I can navigate the tricky waters of family involvement better than the last time we moved. There were some lingering feelings of hostility on my part after the move that have taken a long time to dissipate, but this time I'm hoping we can set expectations way in advance so I don't shoot flames out of my eyes and ears on moving day, using my super powers for evil instead of good.

       This will be brief, I am absolutely stuck on a development problem that has got me concerned about my diminishing dev skills, and&nbsp;I feel it needs to be solved by me alone in order to save face. So, I guess I'll be back once that's resolved.    &nbsp;  In the meantime, here are some current rants I have floating around in my head;  Tour de France - I wish Jan ullrich had won the time trial yesterday. I have such a tendency towards the underdog.  No more Sheryl Crow on Tour de France coverage, please! What the hell does she know about cycling? I think Lance sucks for ditching his wife who stuck by him through illness and a crazy life of race training,&nbsp;blecko...  I can't stand sleeping with the air conditioner on. Even though its necessary with the yucky weather, it buggers up my sinuses something awful.  how much&nbsp;construction are they going to do on the apartment across the street at 7.30am every day? It's been MONTHS of noise,so its not my fault I'm cranky when I am woken up. Fuckers, I fantasize every morning about pitching various household articles at them from our balcony. Funny, I don't think the nasty glares I give them on my way to the bus stop are having the desired effect...  And finally...    A nurse will be coming by our place to do a physical on glen and I for our mortgage insurance. This requires a blood and urine sample. I wonder what they will be searching for exactly? I'm a little concerned about this, I was a teenager with certain habits...Ahem. Not to mention the performance anxiety I get about piddle, if you read this blog, you know what I'm talking about. Should be fun. I'm getting very good at letting perfect strangers with medical degrees poke me.    oh, one more thing... Melanie, if your reading this... HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I miss you, I hope you are having a great birthday.

       Yesterday after work I walked over to HMV to meet a friend for dinner. While waiting, I saw a sale rack with tons of CDs for 7.99 or less. I am such a sucker. I decided on three very different and dare I say complimenting (nah, I don't think so) choices: Twisted Sister, Aimee Mann, and Prince (Under the cherry moon). Let me explain. Twisted sister is hilarious and oddly, I know all the lyrics, which I blame on my older brother who I tried to emulate. When I moved out of my parents the first time, the ex and I played a friends copy while moving,&nbsp;it was a lot of fun and&nbsp;it must have made our new neighbours a bit distraught. This one's all about pure nostalgia, and I figured I should have my own copy at last. Aimee Mann, well, she's from Till Tuesday, and I remember her as a strong feminist, the way I remember Joan Jett. Anyone remember 'Voices Carry'? I hear that some of her solo stuff is really good so for 5.99 I'll give it a go. Finally, Under the cherry moon. I only had a copied tape of this that an old&nbsp;friend made for me. I will naturally think of Roxane when I listen to it, I do miss her, but damn she was no good at making tapes. Anyway, 'sometimes it snows in April' is such a good song. Afterwards, I met my friend Donna and we decided to go to Ferreira, a Portuguese restaurant on Peel. I've been wanting to try it since Glen and I returned from Portugal, but its pretty costly. Donna suggested I choose the bottle of red. I'm not too knowledgeable with Portuguese wine, I've had great wine in Portugal, but the Portuguese wine I've had here in Montreal sucks. Something must have stuck in my head from out trip because the bottle I chose was Monte vehlo, a bottle Glen and I had and enjoyed many times in Portugal. Of course, the difference being that in Portugal, the bottle cost at most 4 euros, while we paid 40$ cdn, but it was good nonetheless. The meal was not as spectacular as I expected. I had swordfish on a bed of mashed potatoes and green beans, which was pretty average in taste. Two mains and a bottle ended up costing over 100 dollars, and we didn't even have appetizers. But the little details there were so nice; the fresh corn bread, the outstanding olive oil, the seat on the terrace, etc. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it, but when it comes to Portuguese fare, so far I'm convinced the inexpensive but D-licious coco Rico is the way to go.  Ok, enough about the food and wine. It was great to see Donna. We had a nice walk after and went to Calories for dessert and more conversation. Every time I see her I think we should hang out together more, if only our lives weren't so packed with so much other stuff. I need more face time with girlfriends, I always come away from a date with my girlfriends feeling happy for having made the time to do so.

       While waiting for the bus this morning, I remembered that I was suppose to call the hospital to get my colposcopy results. After about 7 or 8 attempts (pretty standard fare, I never expect to reach the office on the first try, that's Quebec health care for you) I got through, and the nurse told me that my results came back negative, no abnormal cells on my cervix. It was a surprise, I generally expect the worst. Anyway, I have to go back in 6 months for a follow up and if its ok after that, then I can go back to having my hoo hoo poked by only one doctor twice a year. Over a year ago, I had 'negative' results, and I was suppose to go back for one final check up, but when I got the results I was positive for abnormal cells again. Grumble...It's a catch-22 really; I hate the invasive appointments and knowing there's something wrong, but if they told me I didn't have to go anymore, I'd be worried it would come back again and no one will catch it, leaving it to fester and develop into pre-cancer or something .  Down with abnormal cells!

         Warning: As polite as I've tried to make this, I am indeed discussing going to the can.       Yesterday during breakfast at our usual spot with glen's parents, I had a mishap in the washroom. After having gone to the washroom, I realized the toilet would not flush. Believe it or not, I usually check these kind of things out first before committing, but not this time. Absolute mortification and anxiety all at once. After having resolved there was nothing that could be done short of announcing it to the staff in front of everyone, I decided to close the door behind me and pretend I had nothing to do with it.  &nbsp;  Today, halfway through my morning coffee, my stomach lurched and I had to dash to the washroom (my stomach dictates my life). I would seriously prefer to see no one in the washroom when I got there, but one of my team members was there. I have what I call bathroom performance anxiety, which means basically, if I think someone can hear me, I can't go. If someone coughs in the middle of my piddle, I stop :-) but this was a case of, 'need to go, now'. So I say hello and duck into the stall. She then proceeds to talk to me about her timesheets and asking me if our boss will be in, if she can get her timesheets signed, blah, blah, blah. I give short answers hoping she'll get the hint; when the door is closed, can we please stop talking? I really prefer to anonymously share the washroom, politely pretending we don't know what the other is doing right beside you. But then she goes into a stall to do her thing, and continues talking to me. I decide to blow my nose in the hopes of muffling any other sound I may make, and she says ' hey, do you have a cold?' . 'Um, no'. God damn, talk about awkward and unnerving. Calling my bluff! Doesn't she know the rules of sharing the&nbsp;women's washroom? Unless you are drunk in a bar washroom where chit chat is pretty common, leave me be!&nbsp;   So I'm a little neurotic about my bathroom behaviour, but I would bet cold hard cash, most women are like that. I know lots of women who fess up to similar bathroom behaviour. My situation is a little special. I have a weird stomach situation where basically I am hit with stomach cramping and cold sweats. Infamous IBS symptoms apparently. If I could have my way, all bathroom stalls would be like those of Europe, completely closed off, like a closet, from floor to ceiling with an actual door. Complete anonymity. Free to pee, you and me, that's how the song went, right? Maybe the message here is for me to lay off the coffee, as it was the instigator in both scenarios. Stupid coffee.

       its quiet in the office right now, everyone left early. I'm too wimpy to leave early, so instead I'll update my blog.   I really want to see the quick time of will ferrell in   urlLink  www.whitehousewest.com    but it won't work on my pc for some dang reason. Bummer.   this weekend is the gay pride parade here in mtl. yay, that's fun stuff. We usually catch it near peel, but this year we plan to go to the village to get the full experience. I hope I don't cry again, I cried like a suck when the first legally married gay couple walked in the parade. Its the best parade in mtl. I don't get folks that this the st. patties day parade is good. c'est caca. Its too cold in march, the floats are boring. The pride parade is where it's at. Its hot and everyone seems so kind and tolerant of one another.   my family are due to return from their vacation today, but I hear that coming over the border is chaos this weekend because of the American democratic convention in Boston that has got border patrol on high alert. hehe...That's funny, my family gets crazy about crossing the border, like preparing for an inquest.    the ugly process of packing for the move has started. Boxes are everywhere. I have way too much crap. The notary has started the work for us, and this weekend we will pay our last rent cheque. neato.

       many people have asked&nbsp;about any vacation plans I may have. Glen and I really thought we'd be off somewhere this summer, especially since I took a semester off school and I plan to go hard with my classes over the next year in order to finish my BA, which will not leave much time next summer to go anywhere. But then we bought the condo, and we could not rationalize going away this summer. I'm so envious of people taking time off, because I feel borderline burnout with all the work/condo/moving craziness.    in any case,&nbsp;glen and I are looking to take a couple days after we move&nbsp;to just relax. We want a real 'vacation' but financially it does not make sense to be off at a resort or in the Rockies anytime soon. So we added three days off to a weekend in September and I just booked 2 nights at a spa near Bedford. Not only will they pick us up and drop us off in Montreal so we don't need to rent a car, but we will spend two nights there, have 3 meals and 2 spa treatments a day and free access to 6 different types of baths/pools. I am so excited, I am so convinced it will be therapeutic. I am already scheduled for a stone massage, a facial, a Californian massage and a mud body wrap. I've only had the Californian massage before, all the other treatments will be new to me, I can't wait. It's decadent, but I think it will be much needed. It gives me something I look forward to, and both of us can later submit the massage receipts to our insurance and get a sum of money back that makes the expense totally worth it.

       while making dinner last night, we got a phone call from a nurse in order to do a phone interview for our mortgage insurance, which is pretty much the same thing as life insurance. The assumption was that we would do a phone interview and then she would come to our house for a blood and urine sample. Based on that, it would seem futile to lie during the call. Right away I got tripped up on the topic of smoking cigarettes. Even though I quit, the fact that I had a couple with friends once in a while was a strike against me. Ultimately, the question was phrased, 'over how many years have I been on/off smoking?' Fuck! That's not how that was suppose to go. I quit already and now I had to say I've been on/off for almost 10 years, even though 4 years of the duration were completely cigarette free. So I was originally quoted a price for two non smokers, but I predict we will have to pay a lot more once the phone results are tabulated. I will pretty much be classified as a smoker, even though it tortures me that I don't smoke! I am so upset with myself. On top of that chaos, she asked about other stuff, and I admitted to the occasional toke. After quantifying the exact amount, which was ridiculous and mortifying all at once, I find out there will be no blood or urine sample needed. Say what? All for not?    the truth is, I'm glad that I thought I would have to do the tests so that my answers remained honest. If I thought I had the opportunity to fib I might have been dishonest about it, and I'd probably always feel like I might get caught. I am a terrible liar, I really should just give up the idea of lying for profit, it can't happen without terrible indigestion and tell-tale heart repercussions.

       it appears that my hunch was a good one, but I wonder if I was the only one that didn't see some changes coming at work. This morning my manager let one of our consultants go. She's been with us for over a year, and I really like her, so I find it sad. On top of that, she's extremely talented, so we will feel the loss acutely. Following this info, I found out that I am slated to take over development in her stead. Ok, so I'm back to full time dev, and I still have team lead duties? When am I suppose to run meetings and prepare documentation? Personally, as time goes on and I see what chunk of my personal life has been sucked away by work, I am all too glad to go back to a dev role, but I do not intend on working extra to make up for the team lead work that needs doing. In fact, I wish I had the balls to ask for my old life back. There was a time I was busy from 9 to 5 and then it was home free. Now I'm not always busy but expected to be available at any time. I couldn't even have regular plans to eat at my parents through the week because it was an inconvenience for my managers if I left at a normal time. My pay is the same, so the work I do, dev or team lead is irrelevent. here's hoping my dev skills have not completely diminished.

       oh, how neglectful I've been. My apologies dear blog - here's the excitement you've missed out on.    The Bourne supremacy was a fun summer flick, go see it.    Packing for the move is on its way.    Work has been busy like the bee - I think I've been demoted to a development role, but no one's telling....hmmm, always with the conspiracy theories...    I went a whole week without buying a lunch last week, I feel like a champ for bringing in my healthful lunches.    Fisho, formerly known as Seabowl, loves his new food.    All of us in the apartment, Fisho, Gord, Glen and I are happy that the humidity has passed and left us with bearable sleep weather.    My whole family is on vacation, and despite the fact I was ticked off that I was not invited (I know they see it otherwise) I am so sad&nbsp;- I checked the weather where they are and its rainy all week, how unfair. I&nbsp;hope they have a fun time anyway.&nbsp;    I am devouring Mis(conceptions), by Naomi Wolfe; it's a scary read about the birth industry in America, and I've learned a thing or two - read it! It's 7.99 at indigo which made it impossible to turn down. It's made me think - if I do have a child in my fertile lifetime, I need the people in my life to read this book, its eye opening.    I made spaghetti and meatballs for me alone; glen hates meatballs and I am in love with anything made with breadcrumbs, cheese, garlic, onions, and meat in a savory tomato sauce. Delicious, I swear.    so that's the news.     &nbsp;   question - what font/size should I stick with for my blog?    what about this one?    what about this one?    what about this one?    what about this one?    anybody out there want to weigh in? (hello??) &nbsp;

       the notary has not called us back yet, I am on 'orange' alert level with the move. Whine...Why can't anyone involved in this process take some initiative? We have 3 weekends left before the move, and we still don't have an appointment with the notary. I really want this thing done with at this point. My sanity depends on it. My advice for others that are buying a new place, get use to the idea of waiting for others to call you. Wait, wait, wait. exciting events this week include the new ikea catalogue. Ok, I know the craftsmanship is shoddy, but what other choices out there are there? My favorite ikea items include rivig (the stuffed cat toy), poang (cool chair), and PATRULL (children's stool that has been used for more naught endeavors..teehee). in a completely out of character move, I went to BCBG and bought a dress for a wedding I'm going to in September. I tried all over downtown first, but since most stores still have their summer stock or no dresses at all, I decided to give it a try. What luck! 30 and 50% off most dresses in the store. I was a brave gal and tried on something like 20 dresses. There was grunting, swearing, sweating and shimmying as I tried to get into a few of them. My original estimate of size 10 was too big, so then it was chaos as I had to try size 8's and 6's. Size 6 fits, but I need to be a contortionist to get my ass into it. In the end, it was down to 2 dresses, and the sales gal suggested the one with more colour. Normally I go conservative, but I decided if I'm going to drop some money in this store I may as well get something more fashionable. And so, I now own the most expensive dress I've ever bought. tonight a bunch of us from work are going out for a friends birthday to Zen for dinner. I can't wait. Despite trying to be on a diet, I already plan to gorge on duck and other tasty items. yum. Glen doesn't know it yet (but he will once he reads this...) but we are also planning to boogie on over to electric avenue for some old school dancing. Word.

       I am currently in the middle of trying to prove my development skills again. I have 5-7 days to produce a chunk of work, and right now I have little faith my rusty abilities. So, I must set aside my blog in order to put all my brain power on this work. I really need this to go smoothly, so I'll pray to the programming gods for some assistance.
