      I dislike my computer to the greatest extent. My modem got struck by lightning and I can't get online anymore.  Jess came up a couple times this week, Alysia came up with her yesterday because she just got home from Florida. The lucky shit. I wish I could go on vacation somewhere. She looks like a nigger she's so god damn tan.  I'm going up to Joe's today hopefully if he or my dad can give me a ride. I kinda can't wait because I'm sick of being at my house.  Nothing has really been going on. I've just been watching my summer slip away from me. I'm dreading going back to school, but I'm not going to elaborate on that because then I would sound like Whitney.  Gah, boredom.

      I can't even begin to explain the way I am feeling right now. My skin feels like it's about to fall off because of how disgusted I am with the way people are. I wish I understood.  If only someone would just take me away, even if it's only for one single day. Take me anywhere, somewhere where I can forget about everything on my mind temporarily, and just have fun. Someone who I love being around, just to have fun with me. Everything would get better. Everything.  My summer is going to hell. I haven't done anything. The best thing I have probably done this summer, is go to Mill Hall, and maybe watch some people lose their money gambling at the carnival. Grr, nothing to do here.  My brother is coming home soon, and I really don't want him to. I can't believe almost 10 days have gone by already since he has left. I have until Thursday to jack off.   Please, make everything get better.

      I had tomato soup today. I realized that I really really like it.  Happy 4th of July. Yes, it seems I was correct, I am here like I said I would be. I got invited to go downtown by a couple of people for the fireworks, but I feel so tired that it would be boring. I haven't said much today because of how tired I am.   I stayed at Joe's last night, I had a lot of fun. We went up to his friend James' house and Chad was up there too. He is funny as fuck. I was pretty gone around 1 a.m. I ended up having a pretty good conversation with Joe though. You know those drunken conversations, not quite sure if he remembers anything he said though.  I'm thinking about walking down the street to watch the fire works because I will be the only one there, and I would be at the top of the hill, so it will be easy to see. I'll also be able to smoke a few because Papa Smalleagle doesn't want me smoking at the house. The little fireworks people next door keep setting off are driving me crazy. It sounds like niggers are doing a fucking drive-by out there.  Hm, still contemplating whether I will give this Journal address out or not. I'm thinking maybe only giving it to Joe, but who knows. I figure that if I really needed a private journal that bad, I can start one on paper.  *Yawn*

      It's only nearing one in the morning but I'm getting really tired. I wanted to stay up until I got to talk to Joe about recording today, so, here I am, keeping myself busy. I might not even get to talk to him tonight, so maybe I'll just go to bed.  Sunday is the 4th of July and I have a feeling I will be spending in trying to get farther in Final Fantasy. I don't have anywhere to go, unless I go  downtown for the show and the fireworks by myself. Joe is going to be listening to the bands, then maybe drinking, Whitney won't be home, and I don't feel like hanging out with my other friends.  My brother is in Westchester until next week and I am so happy, I could shit. If this is what it's going to be like when he finally gets his own place then I might creme my pants. He's recording his CD with his band and shooting their video. Jumping the gun a bit I think. I honestly think that they are wasting their $2000, but, who knows, maybe they will be famous and Josh will feel pity for me. Well, I gues I am gonna get going, I have a feeling my computer is going to freeze soon.
