         Requiem For An East Village Party Girl     Farewell to all of those nominal nights spent sinking into inner monologues. Mixing tar with sequences of a life I vied for. Brushing up against all those little boys whose mouths supersede their balls. All the pretty ugly girls too willing to show off scars in the safety of a low lit dingy bar.   I sat. I drank. I listened. There are things I will not share as I watched others prostitute their families and traumas for the sympathy of camaraderie. What I am is not to be passed around like disingenuous party favors. These vessels of synthetic empathy and I have nothing in common. With the exception of maybe a touch of alcoholism and those bags of blow that I hoped they would be kind enough to share.   I will not spend my days living in my self-medicated imagination anymore. My stupid little soul is such a drunken whore sometimes. She used to turn tricks while I pass out on the floor. She would sell my idle fears for beer and whiskey dick lovers that wanted nothing more than a warm place to cum in.   Those nights are over. I'll fight the gnawing urge to descend. I will be well behaved. I will be stable. I will relinquish this mnemonic slide show of waking dreams and take on a less numbing reality. From now on I will not cut myself into fragments in order to simplify my juxtaposition into someone else is life. I will create my own puzzle.I will live my own lies. I will buy my own drugs.

        Ahimsa: The Hindu and Buddhist doctrine of refraning from harming any living being.     I stare into space.  Space is now tar against my face.  Shaken and bloody from the blow.   Car crash back seat Mona Lisa.  My will is to lie in wait.  I know I have to get up.  I rip myself apart.  I am not self destructive.  I simply enjoy the hope of recovery.  Tearing myself to shreds.  Helps me justify lieing in bed.  My painted on smile is not a smile at all.  It is a crimson snicker look a bit closer.  Tired so tired at 27.  Will I ever get better.  I guess it depends on my insides.  Hello in there? I am ready now.

        Your Crazy Eyes..My New Year's Resolution.    I am the crazy girl you have been searching for.I am the virgin and the whore.I am the one who is not affraid of your lithium filled veins or that sick little heart that sticks to things like cellophane.There is nothing common about your steps.There is nothing normal about the way you embrace your broken mind in your ink stained arms.  You hold up your tortured boy scars up over your head for everyone to see.Maybe you don't impress them but you have slayed me. I picture you in an empty room alone shaking.Beautiful is not the word I am looking for but it is the first word that comes to mind. Jolted by the nervous ticks that seem as if they are the last involuntary twitches of your spirit. You breath smoke.I breath you.It's all the same death.I'd rather hold it in and die than let it out and live without the hope of having you inside of me.   I am locked up in a house of flames. I am fucked up and chained to the foot of the bed.The air is thin and my head is full of all those strange things I wish you hadn't said.I am writing this in the dark so that she can't see and try to keep you from me.It's too late I have pushed this as far as it can go and now my dress is on fire.Blistered,burnt and sore.I will burn here quietly until I can figure out a way to gather up my ashes and find a way back to that place where I held myself up with your stare.

        Animus     Once within now without   Scathingly anguished metamorphosis  Here because you chose me In your world I have no grip and gravity is lost You led path paved, worn Prada clad footsteps I follow weary and ambivalent  I will enter when it is my turn I will exit when you have had your fill This is my will  Treading water in this sea of names Flesh, blood sweat and cum flailing arms and heavy hearts Iâ€™ve looked at you from every angle From desire to disgust Just when I think Iâ€™ve found a perfect center You thrust upon, shove away and dismantle all of my conclusions  This is not love only feeding (repeat 3 X)

       STEVE    I hate birds. Feathers, cooing, wings flapping, beaks pecking and all the chalky air bound poop they procure disgusts me. That being said I must tell you about the creature that ruined a perfectly lazy Saturday morning. I was peacefully sleeping off a hangover when I heard a scuffle in the living room. At first I thought it was one of my roommateâ€™s failed attempts at weekend productivity. It was not until later that I realized she was away that weekend. My mind said â€œGet Upâ€? but my body screamed, â€œSNOOZEâ€?. As always the body won.   A few hours later I blindly stumbled into the kitchen to make a much needed pot of coffee. As I reached for the coffee filters I felt as though I were being watched. I looked over my shoulder to find none other than my nemesis perched atop the refrigerator a dirty, diseased, pecking, poop flinging pigeon.   Our eyes met. Rather my eyes met his one hungry little bead of a peeper. I froze then I screamed and then I preceded to try and shew it towards the window with a dishrag. Its wing span far more threatening than itâ€™s stationary stare. It is one thing to see a pigeon in a park and cringe but this was my kitchen. It was then that I realized that my feelings for these fury entities was not disdain but sheer terror. I was shaking in my pajama pants.  After what seemed like an eternity of shewing, screeching and general discomfort I collapsed on the couch defeated. My arms were sore there were feathers everywhere and the little bugger had pooped all over the house. It was then that it hit me he was scarred of me and I was in control. So I decided that I needed to face my fear right in the beak. So I named him Steve after an ex-boyfriend. Who was also hairy, smelly, pooped on everything and was very scarred of me.   I then decided to help Steve out. I put on my pink rubber dish washing gloves and approached him like a friend. Let me tell you he was relieved that I had relinquished the dish reg. He let me pick him up and take him to the windowsill. I gave him bits of bread and fed him water with a dropper. He was very grateful and I was proud of myself for confronting the bird thing.   I left Steve on the windowsill and went about my day. I figured heâ€™d hang out for a while and then fly away and go eat some worms or do whatever it is birds do. A pot of coffee, a shower and two hours of me primping later Steve had set up coop. I closed the window to motivate some action. I mean seriously I did all I could for the kid! Nothing happened he sat there and pecked at the window pathetically. I drew the shade closed I had had enough.   I went down stairs to get the mail. Just as I locked my tiny little mailbox I looked over at the window in the lobby that had been left open and there he was, Steve! He had flown down five stories from my window to the lobby. The bird was a stalker. I ran to the elevator and just as I went to close the door there he was perched on my shoulder. I humored him and let him stay there. We got to my floor and the guy down the hall who already thinks I am insane was taking out his trash and just shook his head at me. All I could think was â€œCRAZY BIRD LADYâ€?. I gingerly took Steve off my shoulder and told him â€œListen babe itâ€™s been real but itâ€™s over. Really itâ€™s not you itâ€™s meâ€?. I put him on the windowsill in the hallway and went into my apartment. Suddenly all I could hear was peck, peck, and peck on my front door. It hurt me to ignore my little feathered friend but I needed to end it. Seriously a single girl with a pet pigeon, I donâ€™t think so!   After the pecking ceased I noticed I had a voice message. It was my upstairs neighbor. He wanted to know if the pigeon that he was nursing back to health had flown into my apartment earlier.

       "Telling me to stay away is as futile as the Surgeon General's warning on cigarette packs."    Today was a sad waste of neurons. Shaking hands, lots of tears and a strong desire to invent a time travel apparatus and get all Donnie Darko on this motherfucker! I hate you for being such a pussy. I hate myself for not taking charge. I hate her for thinking she is your mother.  How many shitty love poems am I going to write? They don't mean anything to anyone myself included. I cannot purge this no matter how far I stick my pen down my brain. I am suffering from thought bulimia binging on words. I just want it to be empty up there because I am tired of thinking. I am tired of the pain in my chest.  I talked to Angie and I was jolted with inspiration so I decided to stay in and write instead of going out in the snow and wasting brains cells. I am not in the mood for feigning enthusiasm or for contact with humans. I am buried so deep in my twisted little head that there is no point in leaving the house.  My mood swings are really fucking with me. One minute I am bouncing off the walls the next I am trying to figure out how to get away with murder. Everybody tells me that it will work out. The problem is I don't believe in destiny nor do I believe that true evil can ever be surmounted.   I am not going to lay down and die. Yeah, I am as wounded as that bird about to get run over by a Mac truck but I will not feel sorry for myself (I really hate birds but I'll leave that alone for now). I know that your poor little ears are probably brimming with poison but I will show you the truth next time. For now Iâ€™ll keep telling myself that one day we will laugh at all of this while lying in bed watching 90210.

       Fuck and Run    As he slid into her she knew it was a pointless. Nothing but two bodies addicted to chaos. She was not wet and inviting. He was blistering her insides but barely felt it through his latex shield. What was the difference between him and all the others that came before? Nothing. A name in her recollection another little boy who could say that he fucked her.   Her nostrils were burning from the blow. Her head was blurry from the vodka. His fingers like knives jabbing at her. Passionless kisses that neither one of them would recall in a day or two. She sucked his dick with disillusion in the hope he would cum faster. She already knew she wouldnâ€™t she never did.   She had once felt something resembling love. She breathed it in and let it out like cigarette smoke. She knew if she held it in too long it would kill her. The fear of having and loosing was far more frightening than being alone forever.  After it was over she swore him to secrecy. He said he would never speak of it. She believed him just as much as she believed she wanted him in the first place. It was simply another night of feeding on sex and substance. She would piece it together while she lay in her bed later. Fragments of memory would come to her when her brain swell subsided.   He hailed her a cab in the morning. She tried to remember how she had gotten there. She knew he would never call. One-second rate half kiss later the door slammed and she drove off. The traffic was as thick as the warm November air. She stared out the window as the skyline faded into Queens and thought of how dirty she felt rubbing up against this beautiful day.

       "WHEN WAS IT THAT YOU SOLD YOUR LIFE OR WASTED EVERY BITE OF THAT SMALL SLICE YOU NEVER TASTED I GUESS I SHOULD BE ONE TO TALK THERE ARE NIGHTS THAT I CAN'T EVEN WALK THESE DAYS I COULDN'T GIVE A FUCK AND IN BETWEEN IS WHERE I'M STUCK."   What is this love like violence that you project onto me with glances like knives? I am riddled with questioning. Your motives so hazy. I have no weapon to fight you with. My words circle round your impenetrable opinions. I am looking for a working vein in your abscess-ridden heart so that I can shoot into and show you who I am.   My heart sticks to everything like unwanted cellophane. I donâ€™t want to change. I like me this way.  The more I love the more you seethe. You and your justified brooding like a toxic cloud looming always watching. I still frame this moment less like a photo more like the after taste of a hangover.   There is nothing I can say that will not be refuted by a pack of lies you blow in my face like carbon monoxide. I am searching the streamline of your ideas of me. I am in a constant state of alarm in your presence and peace is like a wave in your wake.  Your voice of reason makes no sense to me. Sometimes I wish I could die right before your eyes and let my spirit linger to see if you would cry or bitch about how you have to clean up another one of my messes.

       GHOST    The last time I saw her she hugged me with words  They were sweet but worn thin from too many runs through the crowd We sang hard and loud all of their hungry little eyes upon us Devil eyed vixen future uncertain she treaded stiff with confidence  Her beauty held up by their desire to know her 	 There it sat the little blue bag tucked in to her bra (shhhhhh) She dipped in it often with keys, nails and straws I loved her but not with a love known to most  I loved her the way that one loves a ghost.

       "Ross"   This mental masturbation has got me pouring out frustration  Suffice to say my indignation got the best of me again You came out of nowhere like a miscarried one-night stand   Iâ€™m still trying to forget the bloody fragments left in your wake  Iâ€™ll just soak my liver and sleep through the guilt  Car alarms and fire trucks fall silent for the first time  To you I was nothing more than another forced entry  My horrid little gash breaths a film into the air  Soiling all those who canâ€™t see past the pallor of my face  Gushing blood and tissue on collars and wet eyes that stare  You are not better off this hit and run must break your train of thought  Cannot imagine that you are safe in your bed  Your guilt like a failed suicide itching at your wrists Perhaps Iâ€™ll rub up against your memory enough to get off   I doubt that I could ever forget what you left to die inside of me  Iâ€™ll just sit with gauze pressed up to my wound  Youâ€™ll just invite another pretty thing over to fuck me away

       "If I opened up your head and ran a hot soldering iron around your brain, I might turn you into someone like that."      Mornin' Sunshine    Good morning, lethargy Caffeine stained dreams  Gathering the daily headlines â€œWoman found in dumpster burned to death in Queensâ€? New York One weather on the oneâ€™s   Too cold to care about what to wear Sore throat, smoke a cigarette shake off last nightâ€™s remnants  Morning air makes my lungs squeak I get the hint, Death  The number 7 train makes me nauseous  How many more days before I see you? Magic eight ball says â€œReply Hazy Try Againâ€? Kind of get the feeling my life is a running joke I canâ€™t help but chuckle What I wouldnâ€™t give to have us sitting at Cups again at eight in the morning Swapping delusions soaked in Stoli tonics sure beats morning coffee I glance at the suits on their way to water cooler dread I would sooner suture my eyes shut than be one of them

        â€œLights out right now back then and forevermore. With sirens on this ambulance racing to the west coast shore.â€?     ANGIE   You fell from sky into a bar full of trees Devil horned Minnie clad chest and wild smiles Chewed up my crazy little words like bits of chocolate The more you share the more I want to listen I hold you up for everyone to see How lucky I am that you got mixed up with me  More integrity than that of an avocado sandwich You removed the butterfly sutures that kept me together Encouraged me to unravel and revel in what was hidden I was so sleepy, sluggish, and lackluster You woke me up  No more snoozing, schmoozing or mindless self-deprecation You gave so much with out expecting because that is your nature I know you have to go it hurts and burns slightly But who am I to keep you from sharing that gift that fits in your pocket so lightly I thank my little bedside table goddess every night Since you came I have no use for rage or spite

        A CUBAN VAMPIRE    So you think I am pretty? Follow me around like a drunken sick puppy Slip me notes because you are afraid to talk to me Tell your friends you want a piece If you only knew I have no heart to speak of so I sit silent Tonguing my regrets while you stare My soul took off long ago It knew I was taking it for granted Nothing left here but a walking cadaver  Pale skin crimson lips  Feeding off all those who salivate and wish to own it Dope sick like feeling  I wish I were a junkie so I would at least know what it was like to vie  My eyes donâ€™t cry  My veins bleed mud  My uterus constricts  One more egg wasted I will never give life  I will never love  I will only consume  Set fire to all those who think there is something clean here I will feast on your beauty and devour your youth  Do you still want me little boy?  Stupid love why do you look at me that way? I am nothing but big breasts and make up to you  Shove some life up my nose  If you give me some liquid confidence Iâ€™ll sit for a while I will yield for a moment and let you bask in what you think is splendor When you least expect it I will retract, constrict and make you wish you were never born Run while you still have half a mind to do so I am infectious human waste

        Planes make me think of dieing suddenly. You make me think of dieing slowly     Fortification    Years are only numbers Time is an illusion An idea held together with memories We touch them up  So as to eliminate discord To ease our weary hearts The bridge of years between us  Cemented it will not budge What doesn't bend crumbles with time We weathered storms  But you my friend are unyielding Cradle your hate I embrace love  My life is more inclined to shadows Your life must be well lit You cannot judge what you do not see To me everything is a token Every scar a gift  Chaos gives way to growth  Without growth we dwell in ignorance I do not hate you  I do not have that capacity I have lost nothing You have lost me

I will be there soon enough

      "    Jersey City Makes Me feel Dirty AKA Remanents De Jour     "  Ok.I have a good five minutes before my computer freaks out!   It is Wednesday my night off. It is glorious. I read Angieâ€™s blog and I am happy to report that the Stephanie story is up for your viewing pleasure accompanied by a visual aid. Yummy!  (www.veggiepants@blogspot.com) I am still reeling from Monday night/Tuesday morningâ€™s misadventures. It all began at the Continental and it all ended in Jersey City. Once again I said to myself why am I in Jersey and where are my pants?    Today I feel sick, guilty and my self-deprecation has reached a record high. A thought crosses my mind (humming along to the Mr. Softie jingle as the truck creeps down my block which I am convinced is secretly a narcotics operation because today it makes sense but in the middle of January at midnight there aintâ€™ nobody buying a large vanilla on a sugar cone) am I really a hand job slash blow job in an SUV as school children glimpse in disbelief from their dirty school bus windows kind of girl?  I suppose there is a first time for everything. If this were a TV show I would have something juicy to tell my girlfriends over brunch. Sadly, this isnâ€™t TV, I never wake up before 5 pm on a Sunday and my friends arenâ€™t interested because to most people getting drunk and fucking is as normal as a Venti regular with room for milk.   Am I serious with all of this guilt? Have all of those years of Catholic school spoiled me forever? Am I really going to let a perfectly good night of gratuitous groping and grinding ruin the rest of my week? Am I thinking of you or am I simply just suffering from post coital anxiety disorder? Questions. Questions. Questions. I havenâ€™t felt anything for you but friendly â€œhey whatâ€™s upâ€? feelings in at least two years. So whatâ€™s with all the longing? I mean guys can wash this shit off in the shower. Me I am now stuck with foe feelings that are simply a direct result of fluid exchange. It is times such as these that I wish I had a penis.   I am such a submissive little masochist. I know exactly who and what I want. But instead of waiting I load myself up with liquor and narcotics and go home with someone who totally rejected and destroyed me two years ago. The upside to this is that I know that the person in question is inherently good. But is this going to affect the big picture? When I finally come face to face with the real thing will this lapse of concentration have any bearing on what is to be my reality? After all itâ€™s just sex right? I miss Angie. She would say â€œAwww, Vickonkey you were just feeling a bit sluty this week. Itâ€™s fine letâ€™s go get some coffee. Iâ€™m starving!â€?

        New Haven Still Sucks    I am on a high-speed love chase. I swat your sweet words as if they were insects. I donâ€™t caress I kick and scream until you look at me in disbelief. Still reeling from all that has ravaged this poor little beating vessel in my well-padded chest. Can this be for real? Or better yet can this be the one that finally does me in. I am far from where I started but as immature and reckless as a pre-teen on a moped. I hope that my drunken display of anti-affection did not permanently damage your new naive feelings for me. I know what I must seem to be. I know it might send you screaming into the night. What I hope is that you stick around. Because under all the scathing comments and tailored roughness there is a little girl who simply has never been loved.

        Rearview Mirror, Blind Spot Terror    Full speed ahead I have a Maserati wheel between my little fingers  The road is slick and curves I feel the crash before it hits Street signs, crosswalks are irrelevant Full speed ahead  The radio drowns out the devil in my head Looking in the rearview I see days wasted  My eyes reflect red pupils constricted  I do not belong anywhere  Full speed ahead  Go faster until it hits and bleeds Lost among strip malls and guilty self inflicted scars I see mothers who donâ€™t want to be mothers  And children who wish they were dead Full speed ahead  Days escape me and the windshield is glazed in tears I used to be charming now Iâ€™m smeared and reek of beer  I am about to reach the end Can you save me? Full speed ahead How can you love someone who no longer exists? Can you take the wheel? So that I can sleep for a while I donâ€™t deserve your company Full speed ahead You are clean, soft and willing I am dirty, damaged and unyielding I am lost and have misplaced my will to be here  Worst of all my license has been suspended indefinitely  Full speed ahead

       Fuck Helen¦.Vickie of Troy Motherfucker!    Pale face gone tired with living  Skin weighed down with adornments not needed  Solidified by time but ready to crumble like cities that lack urgency  She like history repeats herself   Bubbling with enlightment but numbed by habitual disappointment  Folding at the slightest sign of tenderness  Weary from the battle   Surrender her only ally  Thorough she has been in her search  Please enter   Your will should be worn on your cuffed sleeve  There is no room for tawdry advances   You have won first prize   You will be reminded frequently  Can you handle vanity for vanity?

        Car Alarms, Ice Cream Trucks and Palpable Longing     Tangled up in these words that bind me  Wrangling phrases like a renegade cowgirl  My boots are dusty and my rope is weathered  Complete a thought?  I can barely breath  Dilating and constricting   Scarf you down like fast food  You taste like stars  I want to say words like forever and perfect  Now I feel sick and I am starving for more  Too much is never enough  My eyes are bigger than anything my heart can handle   Questions congregate in my chest like a PTA meeting  I wasn't &nbsp;invited  I need definition  I need supervision  I want to grow tired  I want take you for granted   Words mean nothing my mouth is&nbsp;too busy I will &nbsp;just hold them in  Save them for later&nbsp; I suppose I could just &nbsp;show you with these feeble little hands  Kiss you until your face is raw  Love you until you are drained and weary   Gathering dust under this well kept exterior  Hysterical confessions I keep them to myself  Swallowing the little bits that want to project  When asked to explain my heavy sighs I'll hold my breath  What would happen if I let it all out?  I would smother you with little big words like love and babies

          Judy Blume had it all Wrong     &nbsp;  I am not a big fan of exploratory questions. When I meet people I like revealing myself gradually. Bit by bit. What if I end up hating their guts and they run off with all of these sordid details about me?&nbsp; It is a cautionary tactic. I live New York City land of homicide and identity theft. The less people know about you the better. I mean seriously, have you ever wondered why ALL the crime shows on television are based in my lovely little city. It is not a coincidence.   Moving on. The question that I loathe more than “Is that your real hair?” has got to be “So when, where and with whom did you lose your virginity?” That my friends is the worst question anyone can ask a fucked up girl who up until recently has used sex to somehow fill some sort of cliché residual father issue. I figure in order to avoid the awkwardness that follows such a question I will answer it once and then refer people to my blog site.    Virginity is the umbrella of the virtue family. Without wanting to women tend to leave it everywhere bars, cabs or freshly tarred rooftop in the rain. It is never borrowed or given freely it is misplaced like your ripped up panties that descended ten stories only to land in the gutter somewhere between eighty first and eighty second street and Lexington Avenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Jason Coleman was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen. I was only thirteen and a neophyte to lust. He was a product of an Italian mother and a black father. He had café con leche skin that seemed to have been kissed by a million rays of Caribbean sunshine. His eyes were a bayou green that consisted of earth marsh and algae. His eyelashes were long and curled a million centimeters towards heaven. He had lips resembling soft pink cushions and his teeth were straight and whiter than angel’s wings. He wore baggy pants that hung off his ass as if they were meant to come off incessantly.   I met Jason through a boy named Frank Bollock. Frank was an eighth grader at my grammar school. I was in the seventh grade and I was in love with Frank. He smoked Marlboro reds and played basketball. While I lusted after him he was dating people like Liv Tyler, who to this day makes me cringe every time I see her face. Frank had an older sister named Barbara who went to Bronx Science. Barbara was my hero. I emulated her every motion and followed her around everywhere she went. Lucky for me she was flattered and took a liking to me. She gave me cool cloths and taught me how to smoke cigarettes.   After school I would change out of my uniform and walk down to Cosmo’s the pizzeria that is sadly a Starbuck’s now. Our school prohibited and threatened suspension to anyone caught there after school. The reason for this was everyone went there to drink forties and smoke cigarettes. So of course I was in attendance daily. I would sit there for hours and watch Frank and listen to all of Barbara’s tales of upper teen hood. We would listen to N.W.A. on Frank’s boom box and wait for Barbara’s twenty one year old friends to come down and buy us smokes and booze.   It was approaching the end of the school year and I had already been banned from the end of the year school trip to Great Adventure for not following the “no Cosmo’s” rule. It was a regular Friday afternoon. I had forgotten my “after school” gear so I braved the Cosmo’s scene in my pleated skirt, oxford button down, knee socks and combat boots. It was the same old crowd except for the guy sitting next to Frank who looked me up and down and said something under his breath that I could not decipher. I grabbed Barbara and asked her to meet me outside. She offered me some of her joint I said no and panted, “Who is that guy with your brother?” “Oh, Vickie don’t even fucking think about it! He is too old for you.” I should have listened to her.   We went back inside and Jason asked me to sit next to him while Frank went to the bathroom to de-seed the bag of weed he just bought from him. He asked for my number. I gave it to him. He called me the next day and asked me to meet him after school. I spent the next day with a knot in my tummy the size of the lone star state. I was so nervous that I had forgotten to pack my home girl khaki’s and the beloved L.A. Raiders t-shirt that Barbara had given me the day before. I cannot even begin to fathom the ridiculous get ups I wore in those days. I looked like a little boy with big tits.   I had a Latin test that morning. I despised Latin. What was the point of learning a dead language anyway? Needless to say I failed it royally. It was one of those rainy, humid days that remind you that you take the sun for granted. The bell rang at three o’ clock and my anticipation was as palpable as the density of my cigarette smoke intermingling with the intense odors humidity invokes from city streets. I took a detour towards Madison Avenue. I was not ready. I had that feeling. You know the one that we somehow loose after we have experienced too much. You can actually feel the transition from naivety to what lies directly after it. After a few minutes I began walking towards Lexington with nothing more than battery acid and trepidation in stomach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   As I walked down to Lexington I saw him. He was wearing a white wife beater and enormous khaki pants. His hair was spiked up so high that it seemed as though he were wearing a crown of bronze tresses. I approached him and all I could muster was a languid ”What’s up?” He immediately grabbed my waist and without hesitation kissed me. I had an immediate Angela Chase Vs. Jordan Catalano “I don’t open that wide at the dentist” reaction. I kept it too myself because I was much cooler than Angela or so I thought. Reeling from what up to that point was only my third kiss ever I asked if he was hungry. He said “Yeah, starving. I know where we can go.” Now, at this point I was expecting TGI Friday’s perhaps a diner. I had no idea what was happening.   We walked for a while in total silence. My mouth was so dry I couldn’t form words. We finally reached an apartment building a few blocks from Cosmo’s he grabbed my hand and we rushed up to the buzzer. He began to ring doorbells until suddenly we heard that loud buzz and click that New Yorker’s with rent stabilized non-doorman apartments know so well. We ran in and he started climbing the stairs two steps at a time. Finally, we were on the roof. I knew something was about to happen. Something I would regret. Something that made me wish that I were actually at the library like I had told my mother I would be.   It was raining, hard. He started to kiss me but not the way you kiss someone you deem as precious. He kissed me like a rapist would kiss his victim. My lip began to bleed and I pushed him away. He apologized and offered me a cigarette. We sat on the asphalt in the rain and he held my hand. He stubbed out his cigarette and asked me to lie down. I did. After that everything is a bit of a haze. I remember him ripping my tights. I remember feeling a numbing insurmountable pain and then blackness. I must have passed out or performed some sort of astral projection. The next thing I remember was someone opening the door to the roof. It was a woman in her fifties wearing a nightgown. She started screaming at us to leave. There was no blood but I felt ripped to shreds. I realized that my under wear was gone. He must have ripped them off and thrown them.   We ran down the stairs and he hailed me a cab. I said I had no money. He gave twenty dollars and said he would call me. When I got home there was no one home. I thanked God that I didn’t have to face my Jesus loving mother before I had time to shower. I didn’t feel mature. I didn’t feel like Brenda did after her and Dillon “did it” the night of the prom. It was as far from an Aaron Spelling production as you could get. I felt disgusting. I was thankful that there was a condom involved. I remembered seeing it lying on the roof when I bent over to pick up my text book filled backpack.. I had never seen anything like that before.   He called me that evening and asked if I wanted to go with him to his friend’s house in Queens after school the next day. I said yes. I don’t know why. I guess I was curious. I wanted to be cool. I wanted to be a woman. I was a child and I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The next school day came and went and I met him at the train station. After what seemed like an eternity of stops we got off. We went to a deli and he asked me if I had a dollar so that he could purchase a condom. I said I didn’t. He looked at me and said “What, do you wanna get fuckin’ pregnant?” I searched my backpack and managed to scrounge up seventy-five cents. It was enough.   We walked for a while once again silence was the basis of our relationship. I was thirteen he was eighteen. We had absolutely nothing to talk about. We arrived at his friend’s apartment. It was in the worst neighborhood I had ever been in. We walked up four flights of garbage-infested stairs. When we got to the door it was ajar. We walked into a room cluttered with lawn furniture, empty beer bottles, over flowing ashtrays and baby paraphernalia. We walked into the next room where two of the most gangster looking motherfuckers I had ever seen were sitting on a bed snorting cocaine. They were both wearing bandanas and they made weird little hand jesters to Jason as we entered the room. Next to the bed there was a crib with a baby screaming desperately as he clutched the bars, which I was sure, would be his destiny given the environment.   The two men snickered and Jason proceeded to speak to them in Pig Latin. Something I never took the time to master and I regretted it at that moment. They all began to laugh and high five one another as they looked at me. I thought I was going to cry. The two men left the room and left the baby bawling in the crib. Jason threw me on the bed. I regretted my very existence. I hated myself for being there. He tore off my skirt and did not even bother taking off my underwear. I watched as he ripped the condom rapper with his teeth and put it on. I lay there frozen. He did not kiss me. He did not look at me. He fucked me hard, mercilessly and without feeling. When he came he laughed and looked up to his friends who had watched the whole thing from the door way and said “Hey, who wants next?” I held back the tears that were about to run down my face and ran to the bathroom. I sat on the dirty linoleum floor and cried. I thought of my best friend Christian Alexis. He used to carry a razor blade in his pocket and slice his arms whenever he was sad. I wished I had that razor. I wished I had him. I realize now that he loved me. He knew where I was. He was the only one who knew.   I tried to get it together. It was difficult because the three of them were all out there laughing. I got up, washed my face and walked back into the room. I acted as tough as a girl in a catholic school uniform who had just been fucked in front of a baby and two gangsters could muster. I acted like I liked it. I acted like a man. I asked Jason for a cigarette. He lit two and handed me one. I said I had to go and could someone please walk me to the train. Jason looked perplexed. He expected me to be upset or scared. I was but I was not going to loose it until I was in the safety of my bed. He walked me to the train and offered to come with me. I declined and said I wanted to be alone.   The next day I went to school. Everybody knew. Jason had told Frank and Frank had told the whole school. He looked at me differently. He looked at me like I existed. I liked it. In the end all I ever wanted was for Frank to think I was as cool as all the girls he dated. He came up to me in the cafeteria and asked if I was going to Cosmo’s after school I said yes. When we were dismissed he met me at the corner and we walked down Park Avenue together. He looked at me and said he was sorry. I didn’t understand. He then explained to me that Jason was known for only having sex with virgins. He had done it to his sister Barbara and to countless other girls he knew. I was numb. I thanked him for his candor and told him I was totally fine. Then we made some joke about our dickhead principal and he offered to buy me a slice of pizza. I was in Frank heaven.   We got to the corner and there was Jason. Standing with the two men from the apartment in Queens. Frank walked away as Jason approached me. He asked if I wanted to go somewhere. I looked at his beautiful face and told him to fuck himself. He recoiled in disbelief for what seemed like an eternity. Time stood still. He looked me dead in the face and said “You aint’ nothing but a stupid little bitch and I aint’ never gonna fuck your nasty pussy again” and then he spat in my face. I was mortified. I walked away wiping his saliva on the sleeve of my St. Ignatius Loyola blazer. The tears running down my face felt like lava. I did not look back. I did not get to eat pizza with Frank. I went home and cried for what seemed like centuries.   Years passed and before I knew it I was in high school. Far away from Jason Coleman and Frank Bollock. I wanted to go to Bronx Science, which is where Frank went. Even though I got in my parents were reluctant about allowing me to go to a public school no matter how prestigious it was .I had met a wonderful boy named Ariel who gave me an engagement ring and asked me to marry him. I said yes. I was seventeen. I was insane.&nbsp; He was a virgin when we met and wanted to know if I was. I wasn’t and it frightened and excited him all at once. The first time we had sex was in a small alcove outside the church of Scientology on the upper west side. L. Ron Hubbard would have been proud. I told him all about Jason and he grew quite with worry. “Please tell me you used a condom, Vickie. That kid is such a dirty fucking scum bag.”&nbsp; He took comfort in my reply of yes. I never told him the details because he was too sweet and beautiful and I felt dingy enough by comparison. I owe Ariel so much. Not only because he was the best boyfriend I ever had to this day. I am aware we both very young and naive but he made sex feel pure to me. We were very much in love but it ended after high school.   Ariel’s older brother Justin had been a friend of Jason and he remembered all of the stories he used to hear Jason tell Justin regarding his many, many conquests. Eventually Ariel got over the fact that the girl he had lost his virginity to had lost hers to what he called “a minion of Satan”. A couple of months passed and Justin was home for the summer. We were drinking forties in Ariel’s room one lazy summer night and Jason came up in conversation. Justin proceeded to tell us that Jason had been stabbed to death that winter. I was not surprised. Jason had graduated from small pot deals to full-scale narcotics trafficking. It’s funny how you can pretty much define who you are as a person by how you react to the ill fate of someone who has harmed you. I hurt for Jason for a moment. I mourned what he had taken from me for another moment. Then I finished my forty of Crazy Horse and made love to my boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        My Darling, My Skiba    There's a black box recording of what happened that night buried deep in the rubble of what is left of my insides. I stopped bleeding perhaps my body is tired of waiting to give life. I am sinking into thoughts of fair-eyed angels with broken, damned wings waiting to fall. Is that you, Dark prince? You are always there in the end. There when all the others bellow "It's a rap!" Days are numbing because after all like me you dwell in darkness. I have given up trying to scour my insides with cyanide. I know you like me dirty. Eyes, love, lips, words come and go but you remain. The great hope. I rejected you for I thought I had found another that was better. I was mistaken and again there are thoughts that are doing trapeze in my head and crashing into my netless heart. I wish hard that you will return. I know how hot your San Fran burns. I live for your blasphmous scriptures of pyromaniacs with sickened hearts and bloodshot eyes. I miss you even though I don't know you. Yet.

        "Thursday's are always the worst days"    Inhale the view as if my eyes had the capacity to breath. I hold my breath so much it is a wonder I am still alive. Tired little eyes watching life go by outside the window of a taxicab. Never thought I'd regress further back than yesterday. But here I am. That familiar desperate feeling always dark and cold inside. I sit here hoping it won't stay too long. Bruised from the inside out I put on a pretty good show. That is all I really know how to do well. I can fool a pro. Surprised I've never thought of being an actor. Some revel in ecstatic fantasies I find comfort in certainty. I would rather know and hurt than fantasize and dwell in ignorance. .

        This is what happens when you spend an entire Sunday reading Shakespeare, man do I love that wacky Will?      Charmed but not Unhinged    Tree limbs crackle and the moon a whisper in my ear The ghost inside fingers my inner demons I binge on fear in order to recoil permanence Although I did not initiate the damage I prolong it Can you see me? I am so small by comparison  I am so pale I have to stain my lips crimson  This me I detest and numb ceaselessly This is not who I wish to be When you are near I forget I am starved Alone, the knot in my stomach inexorable In my room fear of rejection insurmountable  Woke up heavy as if emerging from a pool of polluted water My body aching and sore  My heart baffled my head jumbled Recollection is a sweet dream  Tasting you still and savoring the flavor  Are you another one of my fantastic fabrications? Then I hear your voice and know  So deep in thought I can barely articulate opinions  You must be able to see right through  When my eyes graze you  You light up bright as Aurora Borealis  You are a festival of lights through the kaleidoscope of my pupils How is it that I have come across such beauty?   I will not try to hold on  Let you wander Figure it out for yourself I barely know you Knowledge isnâ€™t always powerful This is bigger than me

       When I am Sleeping I Am The Best Writer In The World     I dreamt of words last night  They came to me so freely  They wove in and out of each other like perfectly fitting lover's hands  They created a poem  The best&nbsp;I&nbsp;had ever written   It was about how I cannot remember the sound of my mother's voice  It was about the day I lost my will to hate  It was about finding bruises all over my body   It was about sleeping for days for fear of feeling  It was about the men who insist on buying me liquor  It was about reading about myself in somebody's &nbsp;journal and tearing the pages out   It was about how stupid Romeo was for not waiting just a few more minutes  It was about the last time he made love to me  It was about my first kiss   It was about how my favorite uncle will never be free  It was about how I wish I had a big brother  It was about the boy who made me this hard   It was about my best friend angrily yelling, "Why do you always have to be yourself!" It was about the boy on Lithium who I loved so much but couldn't save  It was about being in the mountain' s of Virginia and feeling safe in your sweater   It was about how much I can take and how daunting the capacity  It was about me and everything I have&nbsp;been  It was about everything I will be   I woke up and sadly it evaporated. I tried to conjure it up with pen and paper in hand but it had escaped me. I swear it was the best thing I had ever written.

        Angry Little Girls Don't Get Cake     This weekend was vicious  Much like my words when asked, How are you? These pills are making me moody, angry and wrestles  I drank too much and stayed too long  The sun rose up around me  In the company of grown men with many stories  I wasn't alone and I felt safe from love  I was the only girl as always  It's funny how comfortable they feel around me  My gift my ability to keep them at bay  I suppose they know they will not get any  I just found out my Adele is leaving  All my girls leave  To cities like a L.A. to be famous  Or Detroit to be loved  I am happy for them  Amazing things just don't happen around here  I accepted that a long time ago  I'll just keep writing  I'll just love everyone around me  I say I love you too much I think  Those words don't scare me  You can only hold on for so long  Trauma is insidious and I can't risk it  I need to stop being angry

        Saturday Night Not So Special      Vehemently struggling with this fear of silence Cramming words in my mouth like a binge eating, blonde bulimic I am heavy hand hair trigger reflex  Strangers filling up wasted nights I should be saving I should be writing I should be seeking evocative stimuli    Free drinks, motorcycles, and advances  No kisses, no sex  I save that for you Just a little verbal interaction  I should be working out I should be pining  I should be saving my words  Company I need company A blank canvas to spout upon  I enjoy looking at myself through someone else’s cognizance It all seems so pointless once I give it definition I should be looking for a job I should be finishing that short story I should be missing my kin This bar is so crowded and these boys are so boring I sit and write as they stare  I want to scream, “Please don’t bother. I have nothing you want” It hurts to think that my restraint although by choice is meaningless I should be home waiting I should be sober  I should be telling the truth I want to be sought after but not by these blank faces  I want to be greater than the sum of my individual parts I am bad because I have noone to answer to If I were loved I’d be perfect and less self-destructive I should be improving my vocabulary I should be starting a band I should be opening my mail I practice Me on pretty little boys They eat it up like bits of chocolate  Not a single one of them is worth it  I don’t want any of them I just want to go home

         The First Rule Of The Sandbox Is….You Do Not Talk About The Sandbox!      When I was a little girl I had this nightly cryptic fantasy that I had to imagine my house burning down before I could fall asleep. I truly believed that if I didn’t it would. I would lay there in the dark with my Strawberry Shortcake adorned sheets up to my eyeballs. My concentration at that age was truly unlike anything I can even fathom today. I grazed the room as if my eyes were tiny hazel colored torches. Inch by inch I visualized the flames engulfing the Pepto-Bismol pink spat walls, frilly girl curtains, white wicker bed room set including rocking chair, Barbie’s Dream House and matching fuchsia Corvette all of it smoldered. I was so good I would actually start to feel warm and kick off the covers. When I felt satisfied with my sick, childish, visual pyromania I would drift off into sleep. I grew out of this. It was exhausting but more satisfying than the nightly beauty regimen that it has been replaced with.   I was a weird kid. Not much has changed. I reviled Barbie. That afore mentioned “Dream House” was often a war zone. G.I. Joe and his men would pillaged and deface Barbie’s perfect pastel world leaving a trail of malleable carnage in their wake and Ken couldn’t do a damn thing about it. I loved G.I. Joe. He was after all, “The Great American Hero”. In a vain attempt at making me a normal, doll lover my mother bought me Barbie’s plastic mansion. This gift was on every little girl’s list that particular Christmas. What I really wanted was a dirt bike and a Millennium Falcon replica.   I remember how much fun it was putting the dollhouse together. The thing was huge. When I was done I realized that there was no bathroom. How could there not be a bathroom? I found it to be very odd but considering that Barbie, Ken, and all of their big busted, small wasted friends were anatomically challenged I suppose it made sense. I was still plagued by this thought “Ok, so they don’t piss, shit or fornicate but where do they bathe?” Not so perfect after all are you Barbie?   My mother had a large circle of friends all of which had sons my age. I wanted to be a boy. I still do sometimes. Whenever there was a birthday party my mother would take me shopping for yet another pretty outfit. She’d insist on dressing me in delicate dresses, embroidered knee socks and patent leather shoes. All of this was topped off by bows, barrettes and hairstyles so intricate that not even Mr. Miyagi could replicate.   We would arrive and everyone would gush over my perfectly coordinated little get up. I would placate my mother for a half an hour, tops. I’d even allow flash photography. As much as I rejected all things feminine I loved the attention. Eventually, I would begin to itch. All the boys would be outside running, jumping and doing all the things little boys do before they realize that they have a penis. All the girls would be sitting in huddles trading stickers and playing Candyland. The second my mother got swept into conversations about boyfriends and misplaced diaphragms I would make a run for it.   At dusk like clockwork the adults would start wrangling up their children in a drunken haze. My mom never drank so I knew I was in for in depth scrutiny. I would approach her submissively. My head buried in my chest and my grubby little hands behind my back. She would jokingly yell “Victoria!” Then she’d scoop me up and smother me with kisses. “Mi amor, when are you going to learn to be a lady?” she would say in mock indignation. I was pathetic. My hair would be sans bows and in knots around my face. My dress would be torn in anomalous places and filthy. My shoes would have to be disposed of because buckles would be broken and the caked on mud was not worth the hassle. Once I managed to lose my socks in an over zealous game of hide and go seek. Luckily, my mother always made me wear frilly cover all bloomers because this girl had no shame on the monkey bars.   I had severe asthma as a child. This did not stop me from over exerting myself to the point of sever air way constriction. When my inhaler would fail it was off to the ER. This happened every weekend. It wasn’t a party if I didn’t end up in an assless paper gown sucking down breathing treatments while my mother blamed herself in the corner. I almost died once after my friend Alfonsito’s sixth birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese. I went a little berserk in the plastic ball pool. My mom rushed me to the nearest hospital. I was sitting on a gurney heaving and hacking like a seventy five year old smoker when a buxom student nurse shot me up with double the amount of epinephrine that my body could handle. I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my mouth. I turned blue and had to be shot up with some sort of sedative to neutralize the adrenaline.   I think about these trips now and try to picture my mother carrying me a breathless, dirty, sock less mess of a child into an emergency room. She was probably praying that they would not call child services on her. My poor mother she really wanted me to be a demur little girl. She would be proud of how girly I am now. I still end up a mess by the end of most nights and the jungle gym antics have been replaced with spontaneous table dances but I manage to keep my socks on.   After countless ruined dresses, staggering hospital bills and one too many peep shows on the monkey bars my mother conceded. We went shopping for jeans, sneakers and t-shirts. No more French twists or bows only well constructed pigtails. They gave me a headache but at least I couldn’t muss them up. She also started buying me prescription inhalers instead of the cheap over the counter ones that made my eyes water from the alcohol content. I was free to play with the boys but I had a bit too much fire in me. I would beat the crap out of all of them. I never hit the girls but found myself constantly standing up for them. I don’t do that anymore unless it is really necessary. I was like the sandbox’s equivalent of Tyler Durden. I swear I started Fight Club at the tender age of six.   My mother’s friends began rallying against me. They were tired of mending wounds and replacing ripped iZod tees. The sad thing is I didn’t hit the little bastards for no reason. They provoked me. I learned about the male ego at a very young age. It wasn’t the bruises or the cuts that made them run crying to their mommy’s it was the fact that a little girl in pigtails beat them at the only thing they thought they could do well. The boys fought one another all the time. That was not only acceptable it was encouraged. If I so much as grazed one of them with an L.A. Gear a gaggle of mommies and especially daddies would be up in arms. My mother understood. She was on my side but faced with the fear of loosing her friends and gaining possible restraining orders she promptly enrolled me in Karate classes.   I quickly abandoned my Saturday morning cartoons for my starched white uniform and the smell of a dojo. I don’t know if you have ever been in a dojo but it smells like someone took the stench of every locker room and sweaty sock in North America and sprayed it aerosol can style into a tiny little room with no windows. It was so foul. I loved it. The first day I was very apprehensive. Then I just got good. I was a yellow belt in less than two weeks. I felt like I had found my purpose in life. I had more endurance than any of the boys in my age group. So I had to change divisions because the kids my age were not challenging enough. I was the only girl in the dojo and the boys were terrified of me.   My mom came to pick me up one Saturday. Sensei Raul asked if he could talk to her alone. I waited in the car. I remember it was raining and I was starving. When she got in the car she looked angry and peeled out of the parking lot without saying a word. We drove for a bit. I asked her what was wrong. She told me I had to stop taking Karate. Sensei Raul had told her that there was a competition coming up and it would look bad for the dojo if its strongest competitor were a little girl. I was livid. Today she would have driven straight to her lawyer’s office to file a lawsuit but those were different times. We went to McDonald’s and she bought me a happy meal. I got over it. I have always had the ability to let go of things no matter how much I loved them.   My mother did not like what television did to children’s cerebrums. She wanted me to think for myself and formulate my own ideas rather than have the world summed up at the end of a heartfelt half hour. She saw me falling into the abyss. Something had to be done. She had to keep me active physically and mentally. There was the whole anger management on the playground business to monitor to avoid any more Axl Rose like outbursts. I was promptly sent to gymnastics.   Learning the art of Karate is one thing but swinging from bars ten feet up in the air with no one to catch you is another. I hated gymnastics. All of the girls were wiry little twigs with bones protruding out of weird places and buns atop of their heads that resembled alien antennae. I feigned nausea, fevers and even went as far as to telling my mother I had gonorrhea not knowing what it meant. I tried everything I could think of to get out of that grueling Saturday morning torture beast that they called gymnastics. The coaches detested me and regularly sent me to the trampoline, which seemed to be the only place where the fat girls and I fit in. After three weeks my disappointed mother came to terms with the fact that I was not destined to become the next Mary Lou Retton and I gleefully hung up my leotard.   Next came ballet. What a debacle. Let’s just say that I had the grace of an elephant walking a tightrope. I attended one class and was asked never to return. It wasn’t meant to be. First off I wasn’t, am not, and will never be skinny. Ballet reminded me of gymnastics in its inherent inclination towards discipline. I am not good with restraint of any kind. I knew this about myself even as a child.   Ballet was immediately followed by the piano lesson. Yes, the one lesson took place at a friend of a friend of my grandmother’s. The woman giving me the lesson was approximately 80 years of age. She had once played piano in Celia Cruz’s band in Cuba 50 years prior to the day of my lesson. My grandmother dropped me off at her apartment one clammy Saturday morning.   The place reeked of cat piss. It was horrific. I could barely see through the cigarette smoke. There were little alters with offerings like rotten apples, cigars and filthy wine glasses of dingy water that needed to be freshened as badly as the kitty liter dedicated to absentee saints like St. Lazaro and Santa Barbara. Ten-year-old Christmas lights blinked repulsively from the dirty windowsills. I could feel the asthma attack brewing underneath my Michael Jackson, Thriller t-shirt.   We sat at the piano, which seemed to be the only thing that was not covered in dirt. I sat through half an hour of nostalgia and twenty minutes of her explaining the importance of learning to read music. I just wanted to play the piano before my lungs gave out.  We finally got to the good part. The weird thing was I got it. I was good at emulating her every key progression. She kept trying to trick me and became livid when I was able to spit back every combination without hesitating.   Well, this pissed the old lady off. When my grandmother came to pick me up she told her that I was “una chiquita malcriada”. Translation, a spoiled little brat. She said she would teach me to play the piano if she had permission to spank me. She said I had no respect for the instrument because I insisted on copying her and refused to learn music. My grandmother told her I got enough beatings at home and she could stick her rickety, voo doo piano fingers up her ass. My grandmother was not a woman known for her subtlety. I loved her for that.   I went home that afternoon feeling a bit trounced and very sticky. I was never going to become a ninja, a gymnast, a ballerina or a critically acclaimed pianist. I began to consider the notion that I wasn’t good at anything except gratuitous violence towards my peers. My mother consoled me by making spaghetti and meatballs. After dinner we sat in our pajamas and plotted our next endeavor.   She never let me feel sorry for myself. Yes, many failed attempts at girl scouts, jazz dance and even guitar lessons followed but nothing really stuck. One day my mother bought me a journal and colored pencils and told me to write down everything I saw, felt and did. No instructor, no discipline and absolutely no funny outfits. I had found it, the only thing I would ever be good at and my mother was so proud of me. I would show her my words and she laughed at my misspellings. She loved my poems and even more so my complaints. I am thankful that she tried so hard. Although I still hate wearing dresses my approach towards the male species has changed for the better. They are still terrified of me but that is the way it always has been.

           Thursday Night Banter          I remember being somewhat happy. Once. Well, that all went to pot. Not that I smoke pot. I don't do drugs. Well, not that drug.None of that leafy shrubbery for me! I like my narcotic indulgences kind of how I like my snow cut with laxatives and pissed on. So, where am I going? Oh, yes! I am sad. I wish I could just say "Look at me don't you think I'm smart?"   I suppose that would make for some shite poetry, eh? Shite? What am I fucking British now? I am a woman without a country. I am a girl without a story. Wait, I have a plethora of stories I have just lost the gumption to tell them. I believe my thought processes and my ability to spew those thoughts are my greatest assets. Ok, I am moderately attractive (fine, I am hot as shit on gravel on a sweltering August morning) but when I am reeking of Bengay, mothballs and that oh so yummy essence that geriatrics project like death seeping out of their pores no lip gloss, salt scrub or Crème de la Mer is going to matter.

         House Guest    I love the piles of clothing on the couch Hot rollers under the sink I don’t even mind the kink in my neck from sleeping without stretching I never thought there could be so much joy in making eggs They swiftly make me nauseous You swear never to let me eat them again I am happy I am loved I am entrusted with stories I would never tell anyone I sit in awe wondering how it is you are so jovial We laugh and you tell me I am fun You let me be I should be sad, disappointed and heart broken I am full Looking forward to future adventurers I have always said that I wanted a brother But the universe has sent me a sister

        Semantics    Words lose their meaning when spoken too often I want to prove this theory I repeat your name ad nauseum Hoping it will fall from its lofty position Perhaps tumble to the ranks of a tired pop song It is only but a word after all Five letters, one syllable Such a small thing to be tossing and turning in my head Soiling my one track mind like a bleeding hematoma Insignificant letters rupture and seep into my chest  I feel them in my throat Like a five large shards of glass Spit them out one by one Onto the asphalt they fall hard tarnished The intermittent light in my eyes exhausted Without me as a host they look like lackluster fragments A broken bottle of cheap wine  I sigh with relief and hope that I got it all out  But I know that it is only a matter of time Until I suffer from an ugly side effect For now I cannot even remember the sound of it

        Boy with the Little White Gloves (2/1/04)     Hello, Hello? How cold is it where you are? My Chuck’s soaked though to my socks and I am running for shelter. Did today fall hard on you like it did on me? The sky opened up and my eyes started to itch I threw a brick at your fragile plate glass image I wish I knew you better Is there a sad song running through your fingers? Thank god for guitars and pens or we would both be dead I wonder if you will ever vacate my memory? Just long enough for me to find another tenant Someone who pays rent and makes me coffee Days are much longer since you left me and my stack of feelings here I’ll file them away and send good thoughts towards Ronkonkoma

         Vacation       Shafts of light break my concentration Bright and hygienic  This must be what heaven must feel like to a tourist from hell I have never been so clear No jumbled thoughts No rabid fantasies Just truth Clarity and sunshine I am well That is foreign I guess I should apply for dual citizenship I am planning to spend a great deal of time here Misery will always be there if I ever want to go back

        Fletcher   This weather makes me think of you It has been so long since I have said your name Subtle projections Break out the slide show Daydreams heavy but lucid Anticipation makes me giddy I remember harsh words veiled with soft kisses You said you lost the bag and the boys were yelling I helped you look for it Knowing that you had snorted it all Without sharing  Sweet and Vicious  the last place I saw you Such an appropriate name The bar ( we fought ) The bathroom ( we kissed ) The patio (w e hid)  Your hands on my hips all the while You whispered in my ear "Stop tempting me" I wanted you to be something I could depend on Like a beer or a sweater You were too drunk and sought after It was hard to tear myself away I had to Forgive me I cried and wished I hadn’t met you I didn't even say goodbye  Spring  street never looked so dim I never looked so broken The cab driver let me sit in front He stopped at a deli so I could get smokes He took pity on me and turned off the meter I swore I’d forget you I did until today I feasted on your photographs with my morning coffee So much time has passed I miss you I know I can handle you now My little boy from  Texas  You are so warm and hopeful I love how you called me "Darlin'" Perhaps I was too hasty Expecting too much I gave you up without thinking You never really harmed me You never let me down October is so far but I am charging through my days Your sleepy smile eclipses all that came and went I have learned so much I cannot wait to show you
