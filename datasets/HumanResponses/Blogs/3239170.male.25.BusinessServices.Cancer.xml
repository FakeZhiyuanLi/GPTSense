       1. Sound Familiar? The Blair Witch Project is suspiciously similar to the 1979 Colombian/Italian movie, Cannibal Holocaust. Widely considered the scariest movie of all time. It shows a team of four documentary filmmakers being devoured alive while looking for cannibals in the South American jungle. 2. Nine people died during the making of The Exorcist, and the set burned down during production, delaying it for six weeks. 3. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist director Tobe Hooper also directed Billy Idol's video "Dancing With Myself." 4. The mask worn by Michael Myers in the Halloween films is actually a Captain Kirk Star Trek mask, painted white, with the hair pulled out. 5. The Ed Wood films One Million AC/DC and Excited give a writing credit to "Akdov Telmig." That's "vodka gimlet" , Wood's favorite drink, spelled backwards. 6. The real horror is that somebody actually thought this up: 1967's Hillbilly's in a Haunted House starred Basil Rathbone (famous as Sherlock Holmes), Lon Chaney Jr., and Merle Haggard. It follows the adventures of a group of country singers on their way to Nashville who suddenly have car trouble. 7. Vincent Price's grandfather invented baking powder.

       Man I almost got fired today because of some big dollar error some junior broker did. Here's the story: Broker A muffed up a trade, then Broker B submitted the correction incorrect for $10k loss to my team when it was actually only $860 loss. This was supposedly checked by Principle A and then checked by Supervisor A. Finally checked by me before being published on our department report to the executives. So later my manager comes up and asks what the farf happened.  Unknowingly, I replied back that I wasn't sure what he was talking about. So he starts venting, cussing, etc. And I had to interrupted him and said, "wait a minute, I did nothing wrong."  So I pulled up my verification report, which I sent to him the day of the error. Of course he never looked it over anyways. He apologized and hugged me because I saved his arse as well as our department. So I did report a correction and the report should have been updated before being sent to our executives.  In the beginning I couldn't understand why he was furious at me since I am the last defense and never make $10k mistakes. :)  Saved the day again, Super Scott! >music plays and slowly fades out as sun sets in the background

       1. In 1858, at the St. Andrew's golf club, board members were debating how many holes should compromise a round. One pointed out that there are 18 shots in a 26 oz. bottle of scotch, and at one drink per hole, the game should be done when the bottle was empty. 2. At the 1973 Heritage Classic, Hale Irwin hit a shot that landed in a spectator's bra. PGA rules required Irwin to remove the ball and drop it. But the woman removed it herself. 3. Irwin was not penalized. 4. During WWII, the St. Mellons Golf and Country Club in England advised players, "During gunfire, or while bombs are falling, players may take shelter without penalty for ceasing play." 5. During their 1998 breakup, Nick Faldo's girlfriend Brenna Cepelak took a nine-iron to his Porsche 959. "It would have really upset me if she'd wrecked my best clubs," said Falco. 6. Bill Gates has been on the Augusta's membership waiting list since '99.

       1. Assmosis:  The process by which some people seem to absorb success and advancement by kissing up to the boss.  You will all be measured on this at some point in your career. 2. Blamestorming:  Sitting around in a group discussing why a deadline was missed or a project failed and who was responsible.  This one will be particularly valuable to those of you who have projects going right now. 3. Seagull Manager:  A manager who flies in, makes a lot of noise, shits all over everything then leaves.  Another word for consultant. 4. Salmon Day:  The experience of spending an entire day swimming upstream only to die in the end.  We've had these before (and will again). 5. Chainsaw Consultant:  An outside expert brought in to reduce the employee headcount, leaving the brass with clean hands.  Nope, we do our own dirty work. 6. CLM:  Short lingo for 'career limiting move'.  Used among microserfs to describe ill-advised activity.  Trashing your boss while she is within earshot is a serious CLM.  (Related to CLB, career limiting behaviour) 7. Adminisphere:  The rarefied organisational layers beginning just above the rank and file.  Decisions that fall from the adminisphere are often profoundly inappropriate or irrelevant to the problems they were designed to solve. 8. Dilberted:  To be exploited and oppressed by your boss (not me!). Derived from the experiences of Dilbert, the geek-in-hell comic strip character. "I've been Dilberted again.  The old man revised the specs for the fourth time this week." 9. Flight Risk:  Used to describe employees who are suspected of planning to leave the company or department soon. 10. 404:  Someone who's clueless.  From the World Wide Web error message "404 Not found", meaning that the requested document could not be located.  "Don't bother asking him...he's 404, man." 11. Ohnosecond:  That minuscule fraction of time it takes to realize that you've just made a BIG mistake.  (See number 6.) 12. Percussive Maintenance:  The fine art of whacking the crap out of an electronic device to get it working again.

       Read the story below from an AudiWorld posting:   "Hey guys, I've got a 98 1.8T. I've had a k04 and chip for a while and wanted to get more performance. I was recommended to port and polish the intake and exhaust. We found out they used abrasive material to do it like gritty sand. So I got with my friend that tunes Hondas and we decided to try it ourselves. We got a bag of sandblasting sand and hooked up into the intake and started the car. We had to hold the gas so it would run. He wanted to let the engine suck in the sand through the intake so it would port it out and then push it out the ehxaust so it would port the exhaust manifold. I was worried that it might cause problems but he figured it'd be OK as long as we didn't make boost and it get sucked in the turbo. After running the car and letting it suck in sand we got about half way through a 25 lb bag. The check engine light was on and the engine was bucking and kicking and sounding really weird. We stopped and hooked the car back up normal and took off the sand supply. We tried to start it again and it was really hard. Once started it couldn't idle and kept making weird noises. We took it out and drove it and it started to make scraping and knocking noises. Help! Can anyone tell me what to do! My buddy only does Hondas so he doesn't know much about Audis."  You comment on it  urlLink here .
