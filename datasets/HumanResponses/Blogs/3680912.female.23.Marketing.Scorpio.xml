      well that was the question posed to me by my three year old today.  I was stumped, i myself am unclear as to the grammatical meaning of shizzle. In the meantime i realise that i long for my life to be shizzle. So my ex-fiance, who is apparently for shizzle dizzle without me is still in communication with me. i wonder if the new rizzle dizzle chick is aware of this. I dont understand the dshonesty of men. A friend of a friend mentioned that the latter friend is currently fo shizzle dizzle rizzle as a result of the courtship of a prominent local lawyer coming out of a divorce. I however told my friend that he is married with children.....fo shizzle bizzle. Of course he doesnt tell his unsuspecting "young tings" of this minor detail, a quick "Im divorced" seems to suffice. Hmmmmmm. I was on the  recieving end of a similar situation, except the "young ting" turned out to be an "old ting" that didnt really think a fiance and a child were reasons to give up a man with a green card. Ah well...........such is life. fo shizzle. Ups and downs and the only certainty is a bunch of experiences you should learn from..shizzle.

       well, I'm back. Surprised, yes. I didnt plan to continue posting my feelings over cyberspace. I guess I'm really lonlier than I thought. Well today is the official anniversary of my disengagement. I've been depressed all day. Had a cry this morning, after the root of my problems decided to call. Why do i take his calls, well mainly because I want to keep the communication open between him and his son. But I think that deep down, I want to talk to him. On those day s when i am in a good mood, I actually enjoy speaking to him. i used to say well goes to show that he moved on but he still cares. but then I recall the old statement that U see as my title. He didnt need to marry me, since I'm there for him regardless of whatever. What am I to do. I will never stop loving him, that's a given. but I deserve more,I just dont seem to be able to get more in this lifetime. Life sucks, imagine me a twenty three year old mother of one is saying this. I am just so tired of being unhappy. Maybe i'll go have  a drink. these pills are taking too long to set in.

      Why did I chose that name, well I'll deal with that a next time. I thought that this blog thing was for people with nothing better to do and all the time in the world. lo and behold, I shoudl be setting this up. I guess I've reached my boiling point. After having drank a screwdriver for my mid morning snack and two carlsbergs for afternoon tea, I realise that I need to vent before I explode. So here goes this is the blog of Trini Empress. The mudslide momma who is slippery when wet. Ah well, maybe I will do this agian maybe I wont. Having a three year old makes it difficult for me to even get time to log on. But maybe Ill try. I lost my sense of commitment when my heart got broken recently. So there are no guarantees.  Well till next time.....  Bye
