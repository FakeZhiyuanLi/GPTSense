      It's so unbearably hot and humid here outside.  I hate Mississippi summers.  Bear in mind that I mentioned our nursing class of 60 meets in an old dormitory building with air conditioning that works sporadically, if at all.  Makes for a miserably long day.    I think I have very poor size perception.  I don't know that I view myself as big as I am, or view others as small as they are, or something to that affect.  Did that make any sense?  All these skinny minnies in class are doing nothing but increasing my self-loathing.  Yes, these are my own issues.  Yes, it's not their fault.  I'll just blame society.  At least I'm putting these nursing school lessons to good use...  using my defense mechanisms already.  Ha!  There's a girl in our class who was nearly Miss Mississippi one year.  Now all she can talk about is her engagement and upcoming marriage.  She's way too bubbly for 8am.    Another girl in class is recovering from major abdominal surgery and sits in those blasted chairs all day.  Bless her bones!  Our instructors were fully espousing the "C=RN" mantra today.  "C is average."  "C gets a bad rap."  "You can be average and also be competent."  I'm not sure I buy into this philosophy just yet, but my standards may have to withhold some lowering as we progress into more difficult classes/projects.  Here's a neat link we read at article from in class today: http://survivenursingschool-snurse-l.org Hope it's still active, check it out.  We didn't actually get to bed bathe each other today.  Instead, we viewed a demonstration of one of our instructors bathing another one.  They also changed the sheets while she was in bed (occupied), brushed her teeth, and gave her a back massage.  The recipient is well liked by most of us so far.  She's a clever, witty little Jewish lady who uses words like "kibbitzing."  (did I spell that correctly?)  That particular prof's lecture today was on stress:  symptoms, illnesses, management, coping techniques, defense mechanisms, anxiety, psychotic tendencies.  When it came to the subject of worry, she included a very short but fascinating blurb on shiva.  If any folks out there care to enlighten me on this subject, I'd be delighted.    Besides the lovely bed bath/etc demo, we viewed some of those PBS-type instructional videos that must have been made in the dark ages.  Very informative though - more of bed baths, changing sheets (more complicated than it sounds!), oral care (both teeth and dentures), back rubs, hair care, and that sort of thing.  One thing I was confused about and never got an answer to.  How do you do an occupied linen change when a client/patient cannot be rolled on their side?  A classmate broached the question to our prof and she said, "Just extra help.  It has to be done."  Not the most effective of an answer...  This same classmate has already begun questioning authority.  He seems to have a tone of superiority in his voice and constantly wonders of the instructors, "wouldn't it be better this way?"  These ladies have more nursing experience combined than he is aged in years, but perhaps he hasn't heard the often rumored cardinal rule of nursing school is to shut up and take what you're given. Grin and bear it, anyone?  In addition, several classmates have mentioned being tired of this hygiene/universal precautions silliness and being ready to move on to loftier topics such as pharmacology (we don't have that until fall).  I actually wonder what expectations some of these people had of the field of nursing before they began class with us last week...  I'm wondering if/when we're going to have a section on body mechanics and how we protect ourselves from those injuries nurses seem so prone to.  Maybe when we get around to the mobility/positioning lectures and labs we'll cover that subject.  I've got to get a lab coat.  Today we received a little bit of information on our upcoming teaching/learning project.  We have to prepare a presentation for a group of 3-12 year olds on a subject like stranger awareness, oral hygiene, healthy snacks, etc.  So tonight our group of 4 decided we'd brainstorm on topics and reconvene to make a decision tomorrow.  We'll be speaking to those kids at a church daycare, so no taboo subjects allowed.  What would you want to speak to a 3 year old about that might be offensive anyway?  We'll also end up presenting our information to our classmates as well.    So far the instructors seem to have assumed we automatically know how to do things like put up bed rails, etc.  I'm looking forward to getting some hands on experience during skills lab the next few days.  I'm ashamedly mechanically incompetent.  :)  Of course, nursing school seems focused on very independent learning, as well it probably should be.  We're expected to seek out a great deal of information on our own.  I think many of the community/junior colleges are doing their students an incredible disservice by some of the "hand holding" that I've seen exhibited in their courses.    Shaving a man, not sure where we'll get to try that.  Wonder if my hubby would let me use him for practice?    We signed up and paid our SNA dues today.  Got our equipment orders - pen lights, clipboards, scissors, hemostats, steths, BP cuffs everywhere.  We won't know our "big nurse-little nurse" assignments until they host a picnic right after fall term begins.  My kids seem to be adapting fairly well to Mom being gone just a little more than usual and having a different pick-up/drop-off person.  My parents spoil them, but not to excess.  I wonder how long a two-year-old can survive a diet of only pancakes?    Tomorrow?  Values clarification and Vital Signs (lecture and lab).  First BIG exam is Friday, fortunate enough to make a 100 on my hygiene quiz today.  Woohoo!  Wish me luck!

      Door prize to the first person who can identify what song my title quotes from today.  :)  All morning - group theory.  Types of groups, communication in groups, benefits of groups, group stages, group roles, group process.  I'm already beginning to see what someone meant (on a discussion board I frequent) when they talked about their frustration at the amount of psychology, etc (less "hard science," for lack of a better term) in nursing courses.  I'm sure that subject matter I find more appealing will come along, we're just laying the foundation for now.  We also have a big section on teaching/learning this morning.  In our cohort/small groups, we'll be doing a presentation on something such as stranger danger, oral hygiene, handwashing, etc to a group of preschoolers, then a more formal presentation to our class.  Not sure what age group or specific topic we'll have yet, but should find out in the next few days.  Our cohort group hasn't really clicked yet and we all seem to be pretty quiet/shy/nervous about this whole thing.  The meetings of these small groups are out of classtime, so we have to organize those ourselves.  Again my commute/family obligations present play a part in the group dynamic among a class of 19-20 year-olds.    News broadcast today:  we don't do injections until fall, but thank goodness we don't get to practice on each other.  Big fun on the board for tomorrow in hygiene lab:  giving each other baths, brushing each others teeth.  Luckily we can just wear shorts and a tank top and we'll just be bathing extremities.  We have to bring a basin, soap, washcloths, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc to class tomorrow.  Also the big hygiene quiz.  Hygiene lecture was today, covering baths in all their varieties, perineal care, shaving, oral care (dentures, brushing teeth), eye care (contacts, prosthetics), hot and cold applications, back rubs, TED hose, and I'm sure a number of other things I'm forgetting.  We had a special guest speaker today - a massage therapist from a local day spa.  All I can say is, now I really want to go have a massage done.  Sounds like a really interesting job as well as training, something I could see myself doing if this nursing school thing hadn't panned out.    Felt even further isolated today.  I always try to reach out to those who are different, been doing that since high school.  I hate to see someone else snubbed or ridiculed, myself included.  Today at lunch was a stinger.  Another quiet, less "trendy" girl and I sat together at lunch.  In the cafeteria, a couple of classmates came over and asked the table next to us if they'd like to come sit with the rest of the nursing students.  Not one word was mentioned to either myself or the girl sitting with me.  I'm hoping she didn't intentionally leave us out, but it's obvious that we're all in the same class...   Bummer.  On tomorrow's docket, in addition to the hygiene lab/quiz and nursing paper due, we'll have a stress and professionalism lecture.  At lunch, the Student Nurse Association reps will come to deliver our supplies (steths, cuffs, penlights, scissors, etc) and take our applications.  We'll also receive some info about the "Big Nurse-Little Nurse" program where the senior nursing students mentor us lowly juniors.  Ought to be interesting to hear more about that...  I guess I'm going to have to break down and see my plasma or something in order to buy MS Office Suite LOL.  I can't seem to get anything done without it - downloading PowerPoints, marking up docs in Office....  just what I need, more expenses in an already strapped budget.  Prayer request>That I'll be more disciplined with my own spending/bill-keeping practices and that somehow my money can keep up with my months...   Eek!  :)  I have so much more respect for nurses out there in practice now, after only 4 days of school.  The amount of material to learn is staggering.  Who'd have known there was 42 steps in making an occupied bed?  Or that giving someone a bath could be so complicated?  Or that inumerable number of types a day you'd have to wash your hands.  I don't see how floor nurses manage to give tihs kind of care and get anything done with the patient loads that I hear rumored...   So, at the end of this blue Monday, as I sit down to cram in my APA before my 8:30 am paper tomorrow, my hats off to all you nurses - whether LPN, ADN/BSN/diploma RN, MSN, or any of the other number of titles/degrees you hold.  You guys definately don't get the credit you deserve.  :)

      Nothing exciting.  Spent the whole time at the in-laws.  Nieces were there, so my boys played with them both indoors and out.  Spent lots of time in the (above ground) pool.  Did manage to get to the university library and couldn't locate any of the books I wanted - found a few that might do the trick for my paper.    Finally got home Sunday evening around 5:00.  Stopped by Grandma's house and she fed us dinner and watched the boys while I worked on my paper a little while.  Have I mentioned yet how blessed I am to have such a supportive family?  I appreciate them so much.    Been sleeping late all weekend, so Monday morning at 5am is going to come way too early for my tastes...

      The title says it all.  Last night was rough.  Boys up late, didn't want to sleep.  I have GOT to get them on a regular bedtime routine.  Didn't get much studying done.    Universal precautions quiz wasn't so bad.  I missed a question that I should have known the answer to (about the prodromal stage of infection) - ended up with a 95.  Lots of classmates seemed to feel that they over-studied.  That's something I like so far about our grading/school setting.  They post exam grades in our computer system (accessible from the web) on the same day they're taken.  Papers, on the other hand, are a different beast...    Our universal precautions lab turned out to be nothing more than a sterile technique demonstration on the part of our instructor, and the viewing of a CDC-produced video.  Actually got to leave a little early for a change, around 3:30!   We have a nursing history paper due no later than 8:30 on Tuesday morning.  If it comes in at even 8:31, our grade will be docked no less than 10%.  My topic?  Margaret Sanger, the birth control movement, her history/education/experiences and her contribution to nursing today.  I don't think this paper will be graded too harshly, as we've been advised by the prof that this is to help us introduce some basic elements of APA style.  Unfortunately, none of my earlier classes have used APA and I wasn't wise enough to learn it on my own.  Looks like we'll get an in-depth education into it these next two years, though.  Picked up a student loan refund check before leaving campus.  Nice to carry around that pseudo-cash for a while, pity it's all going to pay daycare.    Today's lectures were all about communication, listening, that sort of thing.  From assertive communication to interpreters, dealing with patients in distress/crying to responding to sarcasm.  Interesting stuff, and I could definately use to learn to be more assertive myself.    Goals for the weekend:  Get my paper written, and my furiously scribbled notes transcribed into a more neat typed format.  Thank goodness there's no prep (reading) assigned for our Monday group theory lecture.  Now it's off to have dinner with my parents, brother/SIL/their kids.  I don't turn down free food, especially when it's steak!   After that, I think the boys and I will head out to the next town over (25 miles) to spend the night with my in-laws.  My husband should be coming over there from his house sometime tomorrow...    Hope y'all have a great weekend.

      I've got to get up away from this computer, study, and lay out our clothes and things for in the morning.  There's something to be said for organization.  But first, today's journal entry:  Had to stop for a double shot espresso first thing this morning.  I was nearly snoozing the whole drive there.  Going to be a long year.    The espresso ended up giving me a tummyache (not to mention I have a nervous tummy anyway), but I guess it was either be in pain or fall asleep in class.  I'm sure you know which of those two options seems more rational...  :)  Prayer request>That I don't sleep through my alarm (or turn it off in my sleep, which I've been known to do)!     First lecture this morning (4 hours worth) - communication, roles, Maslow, basic human needs, all that good stuff.  Dumb me went and bought a mini-tape recorder last night, but then walked off and left it at home today.  Back to the organization being key, again.  Get organized beforehand, there's a useful tip.    Our lecturer around lunch hour must have been competing for the Guiness World Records fastest speaker award.  We were all relieved to see she gave us handouts with a variety of terms on them.  Nevermind that none of them were used in her lecture, and just forget about trying to write down anything off her Powerpoint slides.  I hope she publishes them on the web later because the whole class was frustrated with that one.  I'll admit that I don't have a lot of sympathy for my classmates so far.  Am I bitter?  Maybe.   Jealous?  Maybe.  I'm not ruling out any possibilites.  Most of the conversations I heard this morning went as follows, "did you do the assigned reading?"  The answers were mostly, "well my boyfriend called..." or "I went to Hunt club and didn't get in..." (local bar), etc etc etc.    Social cliques are already forming.  This is the South after all, and Southern culture still reigns.  Brand names everywhere.  I didn't know that big hair was still big.    So far on day two I'm still keeping to myself.  I guess I'm a loner.  I really did want to join my classmates when they were all laughing in the lounge during break, but I feel awkward.  I don't have much in common with these people yet.  Our conversations end at, "so where are you from?" and other such superficial statements.  Very frustrating for me.  I'm very shy, very self-conscious.    Distance and family obligations are going to prove a barrier for me in that area as well.  While other students can meet at the bar or in the library for a late night study group, I'm driving home, changing diapers, washing clothes, up with sick kids...  This afternoon we had a huge professionalism lecture.  We also went over things like writing goal/missin statements, facility and school philosophies, objectives, goals, etc.    In addition to that, we were divided up into our Cohort groups.  There are 4 per group, and this is who we'll work with for the rest of the semester on group projects.  We also practice skills and do labs with this group, as well as peer check-offs.  I think the only faculty check-offs we'll do will be vitals and enema/ostomy.  I've gone through at least 100 sheets of college rule paper already.  My handwriting is getting progressively worse.  Callouses are forming on my index finger.  My advice after 2 days:  buy stock in paper, black waterproof pens (not gel), highlighters....  It storms every afternoon here around 1:30.  Lightning, thunder, the works.  You'd think we were in the tropics.  Maybe it's an omen.  Regardless, a nice rainstorm always makes me want a nap...  A few questions.    What's the deal with the two terms patient and client?  Is one preferred as a general rule?  Our instructors seem to use both interchangeably.  Is there a secret to keeping sandwiches in a cooler from getting both mysteriously soggy and stale at the same time?  I had a nice soggy/stale ham and cheese sandwich for lunch, with some baby carrots, water, and a peppermint.  Now if only I could keep my diet so sensible in the evenings...  Anyone know a good program (PC based) for making and/or printing calendars?  I've got way too many things to keep track of, and each of our classes has individual calendars.  I'd like to streamline them all into one.  First quiz is tomorrow, first paper due Monday.  Need to get studying.  Got to go get Scantrons at the bookstore first thing in the morning before class.  We also have our first lab tomorrow: Universal Precautions.    Good night all, "see" you again this weekend.

      Today in one word:  overwhelming.    I really thought I was ready.  My overconfidence is staggering.  :)  Started out bright and early:  up at 5:00 a.m., didn't even dress the boys - just rolled them out of bed in their PJ's and dropped them off at my mother's (my Dad takes them to daycare on his wya to work).  Thank heavens for my parents, otherwise I don't know how I'd manage.  Hats off to single parents without any kind of support system or network within their personal relationships.  Arrived to school early, around 7:45.  It's an hour commute each way, maybe 1 1/2 hours when the traffic's bad.  Lots of classmates were already there at that hour, though.  We all staked out good seats (in the front!) pretty early.  It's a very awkward shaped classroom we have.  They're remodeling a building on campus to serve as a brand new nursing department, but until its completion (next year) the building used in the meantime was once a dorm.  You can imagine, with all the walls knocked out, that the large support beams running through the middle of the now immense square rooms obstruct the view of the instructor and overhead quite a bit.    All morning, we had a sort of orientation.  Covering basic university and departmental policies, sexual harassment, grievance procedure, introduction of the 5 summer instructors, dress codes, etc.  We also had a library and computer resource lab tour.  Our schedule included a History of Nursing lecture, but we never got around to that.  After lunch (which I had in the cafeteria), we spent 4 hours non-stop listening to lecture and writing furiously, taking notes on universal/standard precautions, choosing, donning and removing PPE and infection control (basically a microbiology review).  Class let out at 4:30 and I think we all beat each other down getting out of there.  All of our lectures take place in the same room, so we stay put - only the instructors change.    There are 60 other students in my class.  Of those, maybe 3 including myself are married or have children.  There is one girl who is pregnant, due in September, right around the time we begin clinicals.  I told her she was a braver woman than I for undertaking that!  The only other "adult" student besides myself has grandchildren my children's age, an older Cajun lady from south Louisiana.  Maybe I should have tried the ASN program instead...  seems to be more non-trad students there?     Prayer request>That I find someone in my class to bond with.  Only one day in and I feel out of place, old, even alienated.  Lots of my classmates seem to know each other from pre-reqs or even high school (most early 20-somethings).  I'm hoping that I'll feel like I fit in more with time, it could just be my stranger-shyness peeking through.    So it was a very exciting day at school, I was thrilled to be there..  on the way home and once picking the kids up, I sort of had a meltdown.  Out of the classroom, my exhaustion and responsibilities are much more visceral.    On a nicer note, when I called my husband on his cell phone to see how work was going, he told me he was at my house.  I got there and he was washing dishes and taking out my trash - a very sweet surprise to get to see him and just kind of let things go, knowing he was in control.    I'm not sure if I can do this.  The 2-3 hours a day commuting, the 8 hours a day of class, the 2 little kids, the bills, the housework...   Even my grandmother asked, "Are you sure you haven't bitten off more than you can chew?"  I guess there's no turning back now.    That's all for now.  You'll have to forgive my atrocious grammar, I call myself a stream of consciousness type writer, and I just let the words flow as they come out - not giving much thought to my spelling and punctuation.  I'll be glad to accept any constructive criticism, though.

      Glad to have you here reading my blog.  Hope you enjoy seeing a little bit about what nursing school is like, or just catching up with me if you're someone I know or perhaps knew personally.  I'm going to make an effort to journal every day of my nursing school experience, but we'll see how big of an effort that becomes as time progresses.  Feel free to check back regularly for new postings!   A little background information on me, just in case...  27 years old.  Lived in MS all my life.  Small town, but I don't think I fit the associated stereotypes.  I have tattoos and live in a trailer though, so is that enough to be considered white trash?   LOL   :)  Shotgun marriage, going on 6 years.  My husband and I don't live together, but that's by necessity - not choice.  His job took him to a place I didn't care to move (the MS Delta - he's a service specialist for a commercial pest control company).  Two kids, both boys, ages 6 and 2 1/2.  Little one is still nursing and driving me crazy most of the time - typical toddler and a bully to boot.  Big one will be starting 1st grade in a few weeks.  Quit my full-time job last week.  Been working there as an engineering clerk for the past 6 years and doing school at night/online/part-time for the past 5.    Persistence pays off.  I was fortuante enough to get a nice scholarship package and will be starting the B.S.N. program at a local university this week.    Wish me luck..  and if you have any questions about me/school/my family/etc, just ask...  I'm pretty much an open book, and I'm always glad to help.
