      After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend, I’ve decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer, it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However, I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean, why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess it’s just like having a diary, but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless, I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me.

      I’ve started attending this yoga class at the Fitness Center on Wednesday nights. I figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility & strength. I have to admit, it’s a lot harder than I anticipated and that kinda pisses me off! Here I thought it would be a nice “break” from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week. I'm pretty flexible and since it’s not straight-up cardio, I assumed it would be easy.  Not so much. It’s actually pretty challenging to continually switch &amp; hold all of those poses. And it turns out I’m not as flexible as I thought I was. I’m particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class. I look like I stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up. However, I do enjoy the challenge so I plan to keep going. I just know it will take some time before I feel any sort of euphoria from it.
