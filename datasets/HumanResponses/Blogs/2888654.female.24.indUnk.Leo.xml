       Life Is Such A Swirl                    I' ve been getting swelling headaches lately, not the kind that you pop in two tylenol and everything will be all right, eh? No, the kind that makes you want to astral project into another world and be in a happy place. That's the kind the way I felt this morning, I truly didn't want to get up, really I truly didn't want to get up at 5:15am this morning, this happens three times a week and when the alarm buzzed off I put on MTV2 and what do you know? This kick out deranged video from outer space comes on, its bright pink and very very cheesy. the group is called "The Darkness" and ther lead singer looks like a younger Steven Tyler from Aerosmith (found out his name is Justin Hawkins), wearing a Viva Las Vegas Elvis-type outfit, and he has bad overbites everywhere. I find this music video very funny and the song very catchy.                 Later as usual I bought me a grande mocha-white chocolate to pump in the adrenaline in me, and "The Bastard"( my boss, don't we all have nicknames for our bosses?) from work introduce to me a new employee, named Andrew. So basically I got to cashier oversee, for those of you who saw my picture in last month's ColeHardware.com the guy pictured next to me had been let go. We have these new palm pilot type machines that gets transactions done quicker and everyday I have to repeat myself like a broken record in guiding customers to use that machine and deal with  Retail Hell. So I came up with an idea, even though "The Bastard" will strip it off because my job doesn't allow new ideas and they are good ones too. But for now, I put the words "Use The Wand" so that it will help customers use the self serve machine better.            So everything feels like a swirl because it seems I have so little time, yet so much to do like homework,chores,work,having a little social life. I want to give short outs to Ben V.(sorry, I convinced you to apply at my job, but work is work and your doing a great job!), Stuart B. (Can't wait to see your directorial debut and thanks for the flower) and Paul Smith (thanks for linking me and letting me being part of Amipow.com)    Song of the Moment : "Maybe Tomorrow" by The Stereophonics

        From Friday the 13th and so on        So this past week my night started on Friday the 13th. I don't think of it as bad luck too me, it is just another day. But I will tell you my worst day tends to be Wednesday the 11th. Why Wednesday the 11th, I 'll tell it to ya, to me it is just bad luck two days prior to the 13th because on those Wednesdays the 11th, I have lost two wallets, replace my house keys at least 3 times, sprained my right ankle on the Muni Bus( San Francisco's excuse for public transportation) and been in various mortifying situations (Don't even ask).      So I went shopping to Macy's with my cousin Janette and friend Alexis. Janette and I went dress shopping, while Alexis just went shopping. I had mentioned earlier to Janette why I utterly ignore Valentine's Day. Like most people I suppose, I'm not a masochist of any sort, I just haven't had a Valentine Card since third grade and getting Valentine Cards from relatives doesn't court. So Janette was kind enough to get me a card, cute teddy bear, and pink rose, even though she is my second-cousin and and a relative. I thought it was very nice of her to buy me one. I felt special..I ended up buying a two dresses and a J-Lo manufacture outfit that my cousin told me,"It's a must-have for my booty-girl cousin". Her words, not mine.    Saturday, I was sad because I broke my glasses and I haven't planned on spending so much money to replace them it was so sad because I was  going to use my money to pay bills, and probably be consume eating sushi and buying cd's. So I guess it was karma or fate or something I can't explain. I was going to be late to Laura's wedding(my coworker)and I had to travel to Pacifica(5 miles south of San Francisco). I was a nervous wreck but I got see my co worker get married and everything went smooth from there.     Today, I was getting over a slight congested cough and runny nose and I felt brave enough to sing in choir class and eat some lunch while the rain outside pours in buckets every twenty minutes or so. I am inside and I greet my friend Pete who is a culinary student and cashier today and he gave me a discount. I Love you Pete. Then I listen as my friend Barbara was trying to sign up people for a Green Party Campaign. I think politics is very interesting and all but it's just a huge mess. I try not to get too involved, its too messy. Anyway, I met a new friend named Ryan P. and before we exchange names and all I had mention I always meet guys who have last names that start with an "S". And I read him some poems because I am deeply into that and when I was into High School, writing to me was an essential escape in my lonely world. I got 3 hours to kill until Math class.  So long!

      My name is Jennifer E. I am from San Francisco but real bay area natives would call it "Frisco Bay" or "Frisco" whatever. I got inspired to start this blog because I always felt I should express my thoughts. Some people know me as "JuneK" because of the screen name JenniferJuniper which is in fact a song I heard when watching the film "Election" with Reese Witherspoon. Toward the end the lesbian character (Not Reese's Character.."Tracy") has a new girlfriend and there is this background song title "JenniferJuniper" by Donovan. I like to think of him as the British Bob Dylan of the 1960's. So I have been using this nickname ever since and the name "JuneK" just felt like a good alias because splitting the word Jun-iper and using the next letter "K". Hence the nickname "JuneK" has come to place. There are too many "Jennifers" and not that many "Junipers" I am fricken unique(I tend to make up my own words enough to have my own slang dictionary). So here it is I hope to put up pictures as i get into this blog business.

       Subject: Rain, Rave, Flood, Lent, I Make People Laugh, Analyze This or That, Not Again:               Rain:        I heard it tapping like a bunch of relentless clipped nails banging on my windowsill. I am a very deep sleeper but I can get very paranoid. If the flat I live in shakes it's because I think it's an aftershock or earthquake. When I woke up at the usual morning time and the winds were at 60 mph an hour. I really had to push myself to leave my warm bed.              Rave:         I love my Cousin Janette so much that when she sarcastically likes to make fun of me, I roll my eyes at her. It's not easy being an only but then again its not easy for her to have been surrounded by her eight brothers and sisters (4 brothers and 3 sisters). She finally moved out on her own but there isn't a moment that she visits her siblings every moment she has the time. We are the same age by 3 months, in fact her name was going to be Jennifer. But I beat her to the punch, my mom and my first cousin Lisa were pregnant at the same time. It makes me wonder about the ...what if? question Anyway, when I talk I have a slight speech inpediment when pronouncing "TH" words like "Thursday" will sound like " Dursday" or "Threadmill" will sound like "Dreadmill", you get the point. Janette only does this because I told her, "She's my second favorite,second-cousin". My first favorite second-cousin is Matt. In fact, we are more like sisters and when we get together she's hip-hop and I'm casual and alternative.                    Flood:         So I was at work staring at the cashier screen being bored to death. I had to keep myself productive. So when the rain came down hard it started to flood, I was thinking since it was Ash Wednesday. I felt like the store was turning into Noah's Ark. The water was causing the street to flood hard and it almost came into the store. I felt sorry for our neighbor merchant who runs a bakery. Adrian came by our store every 10 minutes to get boots, a rake, and raingear. By mid-afternoon the rain stopped and Adrian was kind enough to give us croissants.                          Lent:       Janette and I were discussing what we wanted to give up for lent.  I opted to give up bread (No Roxie Market sandwiches) and rice( Do you know how hard it is if your Filipino/Mexican/Cherokee/Irish?) I know I can do this because it's not only for me, it's for Him. I got my ashes done at St James Church, then I had English night class. So no bread and no rice, I like sushi but I am game for some sashimi (Raw fish, no rice).                I Make People Laugh:          People were looking at me because I had the black ash on my forehead. I was the only one with the ash on my forehead. I got a bunch of stares and a few giggles here and there.But this is my faith and I am living it up to my faith.        So there is this classmate of mine named Trenton who I like as a friend only. He happens to be a Libra (The Scales:born between Sep.21-Oct 22). I told him straight up front that he is a charmer, he needs harmony and he can be very convincing. So when he was discussing his "Claim Argument" (class assignment) about Prussia to another classmate of ours named Eduardo, I told him, he can be so convincing about his Prussia argument that he could be convincing Eduardo to buy Avon Products. It made half the class laughed, they told me I am funny...I guess, I am funny but my type of humor is very dry and sick.            Analyze This or That:        So we had a break from class for ten minutes and in those vital ten minutes, I felt like a psychologist and a mind reader. I happen to bring Linda Goodman's Sun Sign Book and my group wanted me to analyze them. I have six people in my group. So here I am telling my group about who they are: I have a Gemini,Libra, Aries, Aquarius, and Virgo with me. FYI: I am a Leo. They asked me many questions  about this or that. And they were surprised what I had to say because it was very, very true.               Not Again:       I left my night class feeling tired, I had a feeling it would rain when I felt a trigger on my left collar bone (I broke it when I was seven years old.) Luckily, I saw a Muni bus stop because of a red light. Thank you red light on 23rd Street. I caught the bus then it started to rain when the bus reached 17th St then it pour hard. I hovered at the local corner market for five minutes then walk up one block to the flat.      I get paid tomorrow and I don't know what unexpected thing(s) to do.   Person of The Moment:  Adrian, Thanks for the pastries! :) Everyone at Cole Hardware appreciates it.   Song of the Moment:  "Maps" by Yeah,Yeah,Yeahs

       What Has to be Done                 So my alarm went out at 5:15 am and I was ready to go but then I remember it was Tuesday, not a work day, and class didn't start until 9:30 am. I always don't have time to have breakfast because I know I will eat at 11am after choir class. So I took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to Balboa Station. When I arrived in choir class, my class were doing voice warm-ups...Me wah you wah me.....repeat this 3 times.                 Afterwards, I walked with my friend Vada and I told her to check out my blog and I even told her, she should have her own blog, maybe Vada's World or something like that, she said, "She'll think about it".      Mardi Gras has come to its near end and I haven't yet decided what I want to give up for lent. Ash Wednesday is tomorrow, and two years ago, I gave up sushi and I just want to say I barely could survive, but I live up to that promise, not to mention the withdrawal.               I was right, yesterday, when The Bastard rip off the strips of masking tape to help guide customers to use the self serve machine. He is very condescending and subtly manipulative, I have to ask myself everyday why I work at this business(this retail job pays a lot and I do indeed need it) My positive self talk gets me through the day with my dry humor. I've been working there for nearly three and half years and everyday out of curiosity, I check out Craigslist.org to look over some jobs. At times, I put myself through this mediocre decision and I stay (but enough of that for now.)             Vada and I went to the cafeteria and we had some jabalaya and boy it was so good that my tummy was full enough to take some home. We discuss about how being in our twenties scares us, it"s the period when you go to college,travel, find someone you would like to spend the rest of your life with. Vada had told me that she found some of her old classmates already doing that and maybe in other states young women our age accomplish that whole thing. We have to keep reminding ourselves that we still have time, no need to rush into things so quickly. To me, trying to get through a math class and paying some dreadful credit card bill is all I can handle for now.              So I did my laundry, thanks to my ex-boyfriend turned friend Camilo. He was kind enough to pick me up from work. Then we pick up his friend Dave, who works not to far from me. While I did my clothes, they were practicing downstairs with their band,(Camilo plays drums,his friend plays keyboard and does remixing). I was there for three hours (from 6 pm to 9pm), even though Camilo has to be at work at 3:45 am the next morning.               I need to change math classes, I thought I could handle my current class but with work and all, my teacher suggested that it was best to take the lower class and he's right. I want to learn math the better way, not the hard way. I tend to put myself in challenging situations that I can or cannot handle. And it's alright because I know what to expect next semester.

       From The Workplace and Beyond....        So here I am concentrating on what to eat and what to listen to on my cd player. Mr. Know-It-All (a manager) had to make me wait for my break at a precise time. He gets on my nerves sometimes because he acts like a Nazi Soldier. Well my break is up and I heard there are some girls selling Girl Scout cookies ...what should I get thin mints...no...samoas....and ...tagalogs (peanut butter and chocolate kind) ......

       Observe in Silence:            I've been sick off and on. My mother "Beanie" thinks it was the sushi I had last weekend or the bi-polar weather, rain, fog, sun, high winds, fog, rain, and sun that is so San Francisco. I been chugging down orange juice of various kinds from medium pulp to calcium concentrated. Why can't o.j. companies just stick to one? So I was trying to work when I had a bad case of the chills. I couldn't handle it and I was out of work for two days. What to do? What to do? I have my television/vcr/dvd player and advance cable and gosh the typical dreaded soap opera. I can't help it if these soaps may be so sappy but the stories tend to engross you in.    As I got better or so I think, I was in choir class and we were singing "Goodbye My Friend" and "My Heart Will Go On". Then we got started singing songs from the play "Miss Saigon". The intro is good very fast, very catchy like "The heat is on in Saigon....(very fast and tongue tied like)  there is one part in the song that goes like this:           The Cong is tighting the noose,           Is it a week or a day or an hour that we got?          To-Night could be our last night          Got to put to use.......  The point being the song is fast, dramatic, you can feel the music linger in your soul.I am a soprano and my voice got all caught up in phlegm and I feel bad for myself because I really want to get better.    Living in silence and starting to hear or notice things that annoy me:   1.  I can't listen to the station KOIT any longer, if I have to listen to Michelle Branch's song "The Game of Love" at precisely 8am or 9am everytime I am at work I going to scream in silence. No real offence to the singer, after all I saw her live in concert last November.   2. Why can't my landload just clean the bird crap that is messing up the third step? I am getting annoy, I mean I know I can clean it up myself but man, I work,go to school, and his roommate from hell sits in his house all day smoking cigarettes and walking his dog, not to mention he is a very corpulent (fat) lazy man.He even sits near the steps, I am hoping the pigeons will poop on his head, so he'll realize. I am afraid that when I step out the two pigeons will poop on my hair or clothes on my way to work or school.   Observe, Laugh, and gosh, Just Smile Damm It :)           I couldn't notice the new "Hotline" (my job's monthly newspaper) when I saw my friend Thomas on the cover on this month's paper. I was flat out laughing because two months ago I was on the cover and jokingly giving away autographs. If you want to see a picture of Thomas log onto ColeHardware.com and you"ll know what I mean because when you're on the cover you get to enjoy five minutes of fame.         "Hey Thomas, If I didn't tell you once before, you're a dork!" LOL         Well today, you guess it "Dursday" I got dressed in my J.Lo attire. I don't usually buy fashion duds because I am into vintage shirts and Levi's jeans but every once I got to splurge. I walked into the cafeteria and there I was observing the wonderful tastes and smells. Since I want to clear my throat I opt for simple things like soup and salad. I saw my friend Pete smile and his specialty chicken, cabbage, and apple slices. I never have exotic salads like that before because when I do. I can be high maintanance with salads by seragating my dressing. The vinegar got to me and the nuts too. Pete had given me at least two pounds worth on my plate. And when I asked for a "doggie" box. Pete decided to add more flavor to the leftover exotic salad.       " Hey Pete, I will finish your exotic salad!" :)       Well my body aches from the Afro-Haitian dancing that I participated in the other day. I hoping someday someone out there over the rainbow or more less the Bay Bridge will offer to give me a massage. Just because I have the talent to give you a massage doesn't mean I am craving for one too, you know?        At this very moment, I am waiting for this day to end and I anticipate Daylight savings so Beanie and my grandmother won't worry so much.     sOnG oF tHe MoMeNt:  "God Put A Smile Upon Your Face" by Coldplay  S.I.L.T.D.T.P.:  "Silence Is Easy" by Starsailor

       You Get What You Can Get And All the Flaws That Come With It                  This past Thursday or "Dursday" I found myself at a Black History Month party, after doing my homework and updating this site. It is not that all common that I find myself   crashing   into such events as this. At this very moment, I saw my friend Pete in this very nice garb, I truthfully wanted to bump into him, but he saw me first and said,"Hello". I was tripping off the nice outfit he was wearing because he usually wears his Chef Boyardee outfit (it's his job)during lunchtime. I had to ask him what inspire him to do this special event. He simply said, "Twelve dollars for four hours and he was here (at school, why not?)". I saw him drank white wine and his chef teacher giving me a Eagle-eye like stare . But  I didn't care and Pete was nice enough to pass over some cheese sticks and a can of snapple.       We met last year, I was sitting by myself in a round table. And this cute guy asked," If he could sit here?". I didn't mind because I was listening to Tori Amos, but one thing that I will remember about him is his "Lifeguard" shirt. This always seems to happen to me when I encounter strangers (some random thing on my mind) but I just started talking about music, which is indeed a passion of mine. Then he was so excited to be part of the Culinary Arts program which would take four semesters. I observed him and knew he has great potential ahead of him and I'm glad he is my friend. There was one flaw I didn't like about and that he smokes cigarettes.I am no angel myself but since I want to keep singing, smoking is just not good for your health. Besides, when you smoke it makes you look five years older. He told me that he has since quit which was back in June. I hope he has kept that promise.      Now that Pete is on his third semester with the culinary program, I am glad that he has accomplish what he put his mind to.

           I actually went to the delicatessan (Katz's) where Meg Ryan sat, and you definitely got to try the pie..*wink* *wink* if you know what I mean?   Everyone remembers the 'faked-orgasm-in-a-deli' sequence from your kind of movie When Harry Met Sally. It seems that you're falling for a buddy or have already fallen for them. Uh-oh. You're probably caught between the possibility of having a great relationship and wrecking the one you have now. You know what they say, it's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.     urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Step Right Up: Crimes and Misdameanors             So today in the city by the bay it was a scorcher, not too hot but not too cold either. I decided to get dress for the weather and as usual I found myself being late for class... choir class that is *sigh* my voice is back to normal and my coughing spasms are mediocre. So I walked into class and the class was finishing up on "Miss Saigon". Our voices are kinda scratchy and out of tune. I saw my friend Sara (Sara with no "H") singing, she is recuperating from a minor car crash last week. Thank God someone was watching over her.     Other than that I saw my friend John whom I called "JohnnyAngel" or "JohnnyKamakaze" selling nachos,hot dogs, sodas, and definitely water. I decided to help him to give him some publicity, I am a Leo afterall. But first I wanted to find my friend Pete at the cafeteria and see what he was up to, plus I wanted to show him, his first black and white photo taken by me.  So here I was at "Tastebuds" and I saw him, he was backstage making Panini sandwiches. Being that I was trying to keep up with my Lent promise, I told the other servers, " If I can have a Panini w/out any bread". They looked at me funny and I heard Pete say, " Oh C'mon Jen" and I was thinking,why not?. I find myself feeling guilty doing silly things in which I believe a higher above is watching all the sin around me because I didn't keep my promise. So I ordered the Panini. A couple minutes later, I tried to eat around the Panini sandwich and fries...I slightly succeed but my crime of having that sandwich felt so good now I can't do this until April 10th. Also I heard Pete sang "Do you ever know you were my hero"? and I completed it by singing, "because you are the wind beneath my wings......" It was funny..then I excuse myself and left "Tastebuds" or so I thought.....  I got Pete's attention for a moment and he saw my picture of me eating spaghetti and the photo of myself in an elegant dress. He said the picture of me in the dress was beautiful and that the pic with the spaghetti should be advertise in the cafeteria. I tried not to bother my friend too much because he is a busy man and he's got to do his job. I heard from his classmates that he'll be at "Pierre Coste" (The cafeteria where service is truly done elegantly)next week. If that's true I can't wait to say, "Chez Pedro".  So I joined John and his club members from the honor society and I decided I would P.R. for them by saying "WE'RE SELLING NACHOS,HOT DOGS, SODA,JUICES, AND WATER". My charm got the best of the crowd and I bought a soda from them. I remember watching "Field of Dreams" and remembering the term, "If you build they will come". Well I found myself saying, " If you say it they will come". And that's exactly what I did. I help my friend John by being an open advertisement and runner. Like I found myself carrying a big can of cheese and asking for help. In that process, I saw Pete become "The Jack of All Trades", he is a Gemini, after all. He was going from one place to another and he told me he envies me enjoying the hot sun while he was behind the stove.  Then a minor crime occur when John's club ran out of napkins. I volunteered myself to grab as much napkins as possible. At first, I tried to grab a whole stack but a cafeteria lady gave me a attitude and I put it back. Then I went to the other cafeteria and I started to grab the napkins handfulls at a time. A cashier saw me and she started to snitch at me by yelling, "MR. STELLMAN OR MR.SPELLMAN". At that very moment, I started running fast, very fast. I ran  outside to the plaza where the booth was....(pacing) I was like out breathe telling John, "Here's your napkins" by placing them on his booth.Than I hid at the Ancharchist booth, where I saw my friend Jed. I hid there for five minutes and nothing occur. My little crime of stealing obscene amounts of napkins didn't matter anyway because nobody chase me and John pointed out that  they would forget about my crime in an hour or so.  I went back to the booth and help a little more than I was rewarded by having some nachos and water. I walked up to Cloud Hall and rest myself in the baking sun. It was close to 2pm when I saw Pete walk up and I yell his name out. I told him about my little crime and he was like, " He would protect me". Then he was telling me that his 1A English teacher made the whole class read the teacher's whole autobiography. And being that I am in a lower class than he is b/c I am still in English 94. I was seeking some 1A teacher advice and I had to get to math class which was close to Pete's class. We said our goodbyes and that was that.   I am now fully rested after another day, after taking Afro Haitian class. I had to do a midterm that I wasn't even aware I had to do. I forgot to do my "Mandala". I kept on calling it a "Menorah". A "Mandala" is a colage of my spritual self, I guess the best advice I heard from Ms. Watson was "Struggle is good if you work hard at it and do the best you can".  Well I going to rest up and work out a little more and wait until tomorrow. There are many tomorrows and I got to accomplish what needs to be done one day at a time.

       Subject: In the Habit And Remembering Certain Things...              Always there but not a square my true colors show but at least I'm not fake.....         If you are a cashier at my job and you signed 50 or more Frequent Shoppers you get a bonus and that's exactly what I got this past Firday when Janette and I made a bet to see who would sign in the most. I won! hands down and with that reward I got to see a movie for free. I saw "Hidalgo" which is based on a true story about a horse race in the middle east and all the challenges, one must make to finish the big race. Viggo Mortensen from LOTR fame was the main star. Overall it was good. Janette and I wanted to see it because my cousin has always have a fascination with horses. Even as kids she used to draw horses by using watercolor paints. She barely remembers this but being that I have a great memory, I always remember.    I recently picked up some photos that I took from Laura's Wedding, The San Francisco Ghost Hunt, and random photos of friends and family. Another passion I am also into is taking photographs. I've started out using a stantard 110 type camera, and buying disposable after disposable. I like taking off beat photos because in contrast it shows a person's true colors of what the person relates or feels. I realize I like to take black and white photos rather than standard ones.   People always say, " I have a great memory".      This one is for Rick Fuentes:  Roses are Red, Violets are Blue I know your sad because Martha Stewart has to pay her due. Don't feel bad your the one that is allow to call me "Jenny"  I can't wait to hear your latest review. As temperamental as you are you're a great friend  you have a great smile and you give great hugs too can't wait for your movie reviews   Big Ups:  Rick F.,Mary(the sunshine of our painting lives),Ben, Pete,Sara, SA, Vada,JillyBean, and to anyone else who looks at my site.

        You're Jules! Damn you're cool. You're the type of person who always acts like everything is perfectly under control, even when it's not. You handle all situations with a sort of amazing coolness that nobody can top. You know all the tricks of the...err... trade, but you often wonder what it all means. Sometimes you feel guilty after hurting people, but often...you dont. Despite this, you get all sorts of respect from people and they generally think of you as one bad mother fucker.    urlLink   Which Pulp Fiction character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       The Second Time Around        Juniper's Rating:**** for "E.S.O.T.S.M. (The Best Movie so far for 2004)           Well I finally saw the whole movie of "Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind" and it was a ending that I really expect. If you saw "Adaptation" or "Being John Malkovich" that you can understand the surrealism of Spike Jonze. It plays the same background music like the film, "Lost In Translation". And its no wonder because Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze are married.            Let's See Jim Carrey can REALLY ACT! And Kate Winslet is wonderful as the beautiful "Clementine" and Elijah Wood (OMG "Frodo") is a manipulative plagiarist, Kirsten Dunst is a wonderful receptionist, and Mark Ruffalo("You Can Count on Me") is a black framed, pot smoking, techie who is erasing memories.     This time I found myself sitting next to an obnoxious woman who was really enjoying the movie. I found out her name is Kim, she was sitting on my right. To the left of me was this wonderful couple who were nice enough to save me a seat so that I could get some popcorn and soda. I made a new friend in Kim because she started talking to me about Aaron Spelling Shows, I told her about " Charmed" because she told me, "She hasn't seen the show since Shannon Doherty left.          After the show, I was stalked but in a good way by the woman who sitting to my left because there was a huge line in the women's restroom and she told me, " I was smart to climb up to the third floor restroom". Man, I sure wished Pete would of come but I guess he forgot to, oh well.  Well I had the pleasure of eating at " Pierre Coste" yesterday though I felt kinda rushed but nonetheless the food was good. I especially like the Mahi Mahi meal but I thought the chocolate brownie was very rich. I'll probably come back Tuesday and see what awaits in the menu.

       Erased Memories=Brain Damaged      I had the enjoyment of watching "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" but only 3/4 of the film which really sucked. JohnnyAngel and I never once looked at people's reactions because we were engrossed into the film. As the film was getting near the middle, the theater all of a sudden just shut down. Patrons were throwing their popcorn in the air and leaving their lukewarm sodas. There was some idiot yelling in front of us declaring that the film was over. We were so robbed. Unfortunately we had to leave, but fortunately I gave my email address and I get to see it today. I think it was fate or something because now and I hope Pete will come. I want to see this climatic ending.    I forgot to mention on my last post, that while I was shopping an old friend called out my name. It was Larry whom I know from Youth Speaks and school. We ran to each other and hugged like we were square dancing near Walgreen's at Powell St. He really loves my writing, if he were straight, we would be a great couple. I love running into old friends.  Yesterday, I went to Tully's to get my white chocolate mocha and I saw the daily quiz, the question was, "What State Makes Breakfast Cereal?" My response, "Michigan". And boy I was right, it seem to be the state because I thought of Battle Creek and I always run into people from Michigan. So I got to hold my white mocha on one hand and coffee on the other. I haven't even had breakfast yet, but my whole body would be charged with caffeine in my system.   I got back from my break so that I could rest and "Smokey" (mgr at work) is sitting near the computer along with another co-worker, both men. Mr "Cheshire" (veteran mgr) declares, "There's just no chivary in this workplace anymore". So he gets me a chair and I look at him funny because he's so serious. Maybe it was the heat because I kept getting blood clot headaches while I was working.  Anyway, I met up with my mom and we ate at World Wrapps around lunchtime, after I left from work. My mother believes like most mothers believe that I am going to have a successful life. I hope so, maybe I'll get picked up from my writing abilities, who knows?   I abandoned her afterwards and went to this independent store called "YUM!" at Market St. That little market sells import sodas like "Afri"(a German cola) that has quadruple amounts of caffeine that it puts "Jolt" cola to shame. I didn't buy it, I was after this certain peanut butter that you can't get anywhere else, except New York. I fell in love with this brand when I actually went to the little sandwich shop in Greenwich Village. It's called Peanut Butter and Company and they have the best flavors. So now I don't have to go to the Big Apple no more. So I bought "Cinnamon Raisin Swirl" Ahhhhh and "Dark Chocolate Dreams" Ooohhhh.   Later for dinner, Uncle Ricky decided to make tuna casserole and I bought  Bud Light beer because it was St. Patrick's Day and it was a good day to drink a chilled bottle of beer. I am 1/16 Irish which isn't much but it was well worth wearing some green.    So I can't wait to see "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" again. I got my chance now and from what glimpse I saw. I can totally relate to Kate Winslet's character, her character is whimsical, I'm whimsical. I love this fricken word.    Song Of the Moment:  "Never Met A Girl Like You Before" by Edwyn Collins   Quote of The Moment:   "I'm a witch, I'm a Bitch, and I don't care what you think of me" by Yoko Ono  From The Bright Sun    Sweltering  Liquidfying heat  the trees covered like a dense spider web it lingers for a little while the sun melting like a ripe orange peel the sunrise whimsical as ever in its presense as an umbrella unmoved yet very real like  camoflage facade like a vertical horizon I yearn to be near you but I keep getting  blood clots that float  near the left side of the brain

      Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind:            Two weeks ago, people were complaining about how the weather was so bad because it rained so hard. Now San Francisco has had glorious weather and it's not bothering me a bit. It usually does because of my allergies.         Is there ever a moment that I would erase something that I would rather forget? Yeah, it would be all the humiliating memories from high school;especially the time when.....uh, never mind..... or lusting over jerks that I had totally had wasted my time on. And that is what this movie is about with Jim Carrey but I think he wants to erase something bad, I don't know what, but I'll give you a review. I had also planned on seeing this group called the "Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs" their current single, "Maps". But their playing tomorrow at The Fillmore. Also its been a crazy Tuesday for me because Janette had asked me to see "Cambria" (The horse performances near Pac Bell) and my mother asked me to see this flick called " Taking Lives" with Angelina Jolie, and my grandmother just gave me an advance ticket to see "Etenal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind".     I asked Pete but he had to clean his house before the parents come home. That Man needs eternal rest he works just as hard as I do. But I doubt he will because he is a restless spirit. My best friend Sara wanted to come but I don't think see would like this film, so then I asked my friend Johnny Angel and he was psyched. My favorite movie habit is watching people's reactions when watching a film, I don't know how I picked that habit but it is so much fun. Johnny Angel does it too except he tells me that when he does it, people are either picking their noses or touching their private area.           Other than that I wasted another good weekend working at the hardware store while having ideas on how to design my room. Just so you know it's been very debatable for nearly eight years, I hope to get this done during spring break and maybe have my cousin help me and some friends too.          I saw a cute ABC Family tv movie last night called "Celeste in the City" with Ethan Embry ("Can't Hardly Wait") and Majandra Delfino( "Roswell") it slightly resembles a little of my life. But nonetheless I loved this little movie anyway and it had one of my favorite actors Ethan Embry. And speaking of Ethan Embry, I went to Rasputin Records And I wanted to buy the DVD of "Empire Records" which is a independent gem about a record store or get "Pulp Fiction". But it was too hot and I opt for a drink at "Surf City" and I ended up spilling the whole drink at the Powell Street Station and abandoning the mess. I did however get another drink for free but stay at the mall and went shopping. Also, I picked up my black frame glasses but did anyone notice? Nope, it is only when I have to tell them.

       Eluded:       I really wanted to escape from work as the sun torture me. Ben from work was nice  enough to buy me an iced tea. The resturants across the street made me want to mutiny from the cash register. We have a new cashier named Reggie and I am having a blast mispronoucing his name because he's all smiles. He doesn't care and he likes my twisted personality. Let's see I really want BBQ chicken or a juicy steak but alas I am waiting for pay day woo hoo! I love Sunday nights because I get to see new episodes of "Charmed" and "Alias". It's the only night worth staying home for, it used to be "Sex and The City". But this will do, I really want to have a date or go on a date with this certain someone, he knows who he is but I am so eluded and enjoying being me. I do love my freedom and independence and being patient is worth the wait. Besides being good friends is better than not having a friend at all...

       The Turnout and He's back Again.....    Oh I forgot to mention that yesterday I went to The Metreon and tried out for "Wheel of Fortune". The turnout was awesome, I didn't have to wait long but I talked to two interesting young women named Adel and Melissa. We talked until we got this itty bitty application and flimsy wristband. Also, I always run into this girl named Mia. She works at the local crepery where I work at. We always run into each other on the N line, school, and wouldn't you know at this game audition. I think it's totally kismet to always run into this girl, she's not the only one, it happens to me quite often. When I think of someone, I always run into them. I think I am a witch or something. Who knows, people that we run into we have a connection or a lesson to learn from them.     Anyway, the line didn't take too long and I got to see the festivities that surround the anxious crowd. All 1,000 plus of us waiting to be called upon to do a practice game. There were people who were near me that were called but alas I wasn't called. The practice audition was kinda stupid anyway, but I'll always remember the chant: "FIVE MORE CONTESTANTS!" So I wasted some time but at least I was hopeful. I am hoping to become an audience member, so I can watch the fun. Hey, we all wanted to be called upon but most importantly our eyes got big because we all needed the money.   So today I worked and the closing cashier, Reggie is very sick, his voice sounds hoarse. I told him, he should get some rest since we cashier near the entrance. As I was walking back near the restroom, I saw a familiar man. I didn't recognize him at first until he turned around and nodded hello to me. It's Nate, he is coming back to work at Cole Hardware for the fourth time around, I like to call him "Snoopy" because he has the "Joe Cool" appeal. I haven't seen him since two days before Christmas. I noticed that he has a new hair cut and I complimented on his new do.It's good that he's back because he makes the workplace lively again.

       The Staple Lady:           Last semester, I found myself unable to staple my papers in practically every class I went. I decided to buy a stapler, a turqoise kind at work. Call me prepare and ready for action. I feel like superhero in most of my classes because my tool of action has been very useful. I am saving the heartache of teachers having to rummaged through their work to grade a decent paper. Okay, I am now declaring myself the "Queen of Nerds" . My stapler is so useful and I am glad to help. I have helped my choir class,english class, and now my math class. Ok, enough of the jable(my boasting) time to polish up. Be active and ready hehehe

       For the Genuine and Creative Person In Me:       Well my Uncle Ricky has headed off to NYC for a week and it is my prior responsibility that my grandmother gets the best care and have some fun in the process as well.    I found myself going to the Youth Speaks Building on Wednesday and see my mentor James Kass and fellow slammer turned mentor, Jason Mateo. I was one of James' "guinea pigs" back in the year 1997. I was in ten grade then and my English teacher looked at the class as we looked utterly bored to death. Our faces glued or slammed against the desk and she pulled out this flyer about a non-profit workshop for inspiring writers. An epihany had shot through my brain and I was curious about the workshop, I had "jumped ship" and the rest is practically history. I had participated in slams and although I get kinda shy in front of audiences when is comes to in depth writing. The passion and performance of my work runs right through me. I have some of my best work published in chapbooks and anthologies and I hope one day I might have a best seller or something that even one person can exclaim,  "She inspires Me".      I walked through that  buliding and life has indeed change in that organization, for many things. We used to have to meet at libraries, art galleries, or Unitarian churches. We had to sneak in snacks especially at the library and not be so overzealous toward our work. Now things have changed for the better, money has poured in to sponsor this organization and they have a building where young writers can be overzealous and eat snacks freely. And the recognition as be extemely overwhelming not like when I first started as it expanded. These coming weeks until the 3rd of April young poets are pouring out their emotion and angst in front of huge audiences. I am just here to watch and at the same time be proud.  Oh I went to night school and had english class. I had gotten my paper back and received an A- on my english paper. I was very proud and then the class had to take an exam and write on art/music spending versus technology spending. I choose the first one as a reasonable debate. I hope I did well, I put a lot of effort and deep thought on this subject. Oh and it was good to see my fellow classmate, Trenton who has given me two passes to see any independent film at The Red Vic on Haight St. (Hey Trenton, if you read this you rock man!)  There are moments in my life where I just can't think, for example; there is my mom. I am an only child and my mother can be my worst enemy and my best friend. She leans on me for advice and she knowingly convinces me to listened to her music. She likes to listen to classic r&b soul or classic rock. She has her phases in music and it runs throughly ecletic. I have come to like  her tastes in music but my tastes in music run deep. I will listen to pop, rock, classic, you name it, I'll listen to it but at the moment I like emo alternative music or 80's pop. I am the queen of musical knowledge, just blantantly challenge me, I dare you to.     She was driving me crazy this morning and it wasn't 8 am yet. I had to be in school at 9:40 am at the latest to sing. But she kept on asking about this and listening to that. She kept on knocking at my door. I am 23 and I could move out at any moment now but I choose not to because living in San Francisco is hard enough and there is the issue of school vs. work, I managed both.  After excusing myself from my mother,I felt embarassed walking late to class, when class is practically over. I am a soprano and when the you're a soprano you have to, as Dr. Law says, "Be the Primadonna". We sang everything three or four times. I joined this class because I wanted to be near my friend Sara and because I haven't sang in such a long time and it is another hobby I like to do, besides karaoke.   My friend Sara is overcoming a cold and she just felt very drained. She wanted me to join her at this asian establishment known for its tapioca balls and milk tea called, "Quickly". So I walked with her and we both had banana milk and tapioca balls. These drinks are very good!  We separated afterwards and I walked into "Pierre Coste" or PCR. The first thing that happens when I walked through that door, Peter says, "Hi, Jen." The hostesses and waiters know who I am now and I memorized the menu, I know exactly what I want. I get inspired to write on paper to express or pour my feelings on paper. I had that black and white photo that I had taken weeks before and I wanted to give a copy to Pete. I wrote:    Look, you have a whimsical smile! Expect the unexpected! (I drew a smiley face) Taken by Jennifer "Juniper" 2004.  I gave the copy to Pete and he was afraid to looked at the photo, probably thought it was something else. I observed him, he showed the picture to the other waiters, he liked that photo of himself. Pretty cool, eh?   I started to write another poem as I munched on my salmon lunch and lemon iced tea. It was how I felt as the customer:    I looked into his green eyes  and the empathy was there I shouldn't let my emotions  become too intense yet, the intensity was there  and I saw truth within him that penatrating look that careless expression I was lost and confused  life stood still as I was looking at my glass of water he was my waiter.   Right now I hope the lines aren't too long because I want to audition for "Wheel of Fortune". They will be in town for three weeks, better hurry.

       Simple, Mellow, and Reassurance:      And I volunteered myself to sing in front of choir class, I wasn't the only one. I have done it before on my Cousin Armando's wedding, that was three years ago, when I did "R-E-S-P-E-C-T by gold ole Aretha. I knew I threw the crowd away, I mostly shock my family. So I sang this Slokvakian folk song, "Come Here Laddie", I must of admit my ethusiasm gets the best of me. I am not saying I am destined for stardom though I admit I have tried. I have tried everything at least once, maybe twice, and the adventure is not over yet, it has just started. I tend to find myself or more less excusing myself for my petty mistakes. I like to defend myself in situations because I know failure is an ugly word.   Service is always a pleasure especially when your stomach is growling with intense emotions. I shouldn't take life too seriously, I have to remind myself of that everyday. I yearn for reassurance, no one can't give it to me, I have to give it myself.  So there I was sitting in the dining room being served by my friend Peter, I am so proud of him. I will always remember the moment when he just got started and now he is on his third semester. I ordered a "Carefree Chicken Salad", drank six non-stop glasses of Pepsi, had chocolate cream pie and a glass of milk. I ended up paying for everything else except for the milk. Peter was sorry that he didn't come to the movie with me. I told him he can make it up to me by joining me and doing some karaoke. I even had an ideal song, "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" by Pat Benatar. He also has the choice either watch me sing or do a duet with me, or be an audience member. Whatever choice he makes it's all up to him.   Now I must find something to accomplish within myself like getting out there, being a traveler or writer or whatever my destiny calls for.....I know it is waiting for me, maybe, at the local delicatessen or beautiful city I call home.  The other day I found myself helping a customer and she gave me a defaced five dollar bill that exclaim in red letters," GEORGE W. IS NOT MY PRESIDENT, VOTE HIM OUT". I showed this to people who are Anti-Bush and it was funny. Everyone that I showed that bill to, wanted to know where they can get that stamp. I may never know. I wanted to keep that bill but I ended up giving it to the Anarchist Library group. They are a nice group of people nothing out of the ordinary, just their freedom of expression that is.   Exercise and motivation is what gets me through the day. So I danced my way and exercise that stress that consumes me. My dance teacher is great motivator and every week as I listened to her. I realize her words are a powerful force that makes me a better person everyday.   Song of the Moment: "You Gotta Be" by Desiree  Quote of the Moment: "Life is Like a Box of Chocolates, You Never Know What You're Going To Get" by "Forrest Gump" aka Tom Hanks (Gosh, I can't believe that the movie came out ten years ago.)

       Is it Manic Monday or Blue Monday?:        The sun has disappear and the fog has settled back. People think I was crazy to yearn for the fog..don't get me wrong I do love the sun. I love the sun so much that I even got it etched (tattooed) on my back. It is very beautiful and the design was inspired from a shower curtain, I even remember the exact day when I brought that shower curtain to the parlor. Isn't that unusual or what??   This past weekend I found myself feeling like an empath. When Ben looked weary, I could sense it. I find that I can be very intuitive. I blame the fact that I know astrology so much,(I don't actually follow it through, I just know). My friend Ben is an Aries.  Aries people can be very helpful and some of them like my friends, Ben and Camilo tend to keep their anger inside until one day they explode. Why did I made my friend feel guilty? It was because when he empties the garbage can at work, he does the tedious work of bringing the garbage bag and reusing the same bag. It can be beneficial but at times it can be gross. I don't like repugnant smells,being a cashier can be stressful enough because when I deal with customers. I have to succumb myself to withhold my nose because people don't wash their hands or brush their teeth or their breathe smells.  I made my friend Ben better by giving him a hug. We liked to tease each other into a frenzy and I find myself feeling guilty because I tend to be a distraction. I do however get my work done. I just don't like it when Mr. Know-it-All (Ast. Mgr.) pushes me to my limit and acts so bossy towards me. He can be cool and all but his attitude bothers me because he can be half serious like," Jen, just help this customer" or "Thanks Jen, for helping that customer." What can I say, he's a typical manager.  I was getting bored at work again and I started to think about Monday songs, so that the hours would go by fast. The songs were humming in my brain and I would switched back and forth between "Manic Monday" by The Bangles or "Blue Monday" by New Order.  Let's see on Saturday night, I found myself watching "High Fidelity" with John Cusack and again, only this time I rented it, I saw "Empire Records". There are four things that both of these have in common:  1. Music Stores  2. Shoplifting  3. Great Soundtracks (I own both of them)  4. Love   I was laughing myself into a frenzy because there were certain things that remind to just forget, enjoy, and move on. Also, I rented "The Big Lebowski", I haven't seen it yet but my friend Pete thinks that I should see it. So I will.   When It comes to friends of both sexes, my ratio is 10:5. I have more guy friends than girl friends. There are very few girl friends that I trust because girls can be very mean and vindictive. Whereas guy friends they don't become that way, they have their subtle means. I let my guy friends fly hither and yon, you give them freedom. Otherwise it becomes a relationship and it can be good or messy.   Well it's getting late and I should call my grandmother or "granny" as I call her and remind her to take her medication. I love my grandmother very much and I am trying to enjoy the best moments I got with her before it's too late. As all my guy friends would say, "so long"; "ciao","see ya" or  "toodle-loo". I end this page on a happy note. Tomorrow is another day, no use bringing up old mistakes.

       Five Course Energy Ball:      Maybe there is this intense adrenaline rush that runs right through me, whatever it is I have the power to make anything happen or so I think. I wanted a change so badly in my life that I decided to get my hair done. I've been pondering this for weeks and I finally had most of it done. Maybe I watch too much "Alias" the way Jennifer Gardner's character, "Sydney" changes appearances every week. So I went to Vierra and Friends salon where Rari, my hairdresser had the patience to highlight my hair red and blue. He is not quite finish yet, but it will be done.  Another thing that bothers me lately is being dissed or being pressured . Just because I have the energy to listen to you or for you to listen to me doesn't mean you have to take advantage of my generosity. I am not the type to complain too much, I do indeed have my moments. But doesn't anyone? The point being I don't like to be taken advantage, I am a very forgiving person but it hurts my feelings when people don't return that same reciprocation. Everyone doesn't want to know "flakes". As for being pressured I find myself behaving that if there is too much tention in my environment, I have to get out and walk away until that environment is serene.   Oh the agony of listening to sad elevator music, I didn't care if I had to listen to KOIT at work. But since the MUZAK company installed the speakers around the workplace. The Bastard tune it to sad elevator music. The music used to be low key so that not many people could listen to it. But now that we have this music around I am going to go slightly insane. I like my soul and r&b. When the technician first installed the music, the workplace had turn into Club Cole Hardware, it was rad. I was laughing myself funny because I thought the place was going to be happening. But alas there is hope when The Bastard is not working or if it is later on. My manager "Smokey" (the cool one) turns it to classic rock, and then there is some relief in this joint.  I found myself watching a poignant independent film last night called "My Life Without Me" with Sarah Polley("GO!") and Scott Speedman ("Underworld"). It is about this young woman who is my age, married, and a young mother.She finds out that she has terminal cancer and she only has 2 months to live. She also decides to never tell anyone. And she makes a list:  1. Find a wife for my husband 2. Never tell anyone 3. Make someone fall in love with me  4. Record messages to my kids until they're 18. 5. Drink and smoke as much as I can(because she never had the chance to) 6.Visit my father in jail 7.Go somplace special 8.Fall in love with someone else to see what it is like. 9.Tell my kids I love them several times a day.  As she writes this list, she has an epihany one after the other. This film may sound sappy and dramatic but I can reassure you it makes you think and it makes you cry.   I love service with a smile. I like going to PCR even though I know I spend a lot of money each week but I had to come to the resturant today because Spring Break is very soon. I even arranged for it to happen. The point being I love supporting my friend Pete, I know he does a great job. Sometimes I sense that he is glad that I come and I do love the food. But also I don't want to distract him because I know he needs to focus on his job. I love talking to him as much as I can but I wish we could talk more when his hands are free. Anyway, my energy feels like a five course energy ball because how can a person control their energy without losing themselves too. My memories at PCR are moments, I will cherish forever because my friend Pete was there.    Person(s) of the Moment:  Pete S. for the great service and for being patient and fun. Rari A. for the hair that is not quite done yet but will be soon!:)   Song of the Moment:   "I'll Remember" by Madonna

       Over The Weekend and Through The Fog:         I've found myself working out a lot on Friday nights, thanks to this inspiring gym teacher named Alicia. While everyone is going to a movie or eating sushi at the local restaurant, or when the whole school just feels totally empty. The only place that is still open is the school gym. Alicia has made exercising fun because she is energetic and she laughs when I sing along my portable CD player. I can become such a riot to many people and make their day.    Later on I decided to called Pete up and see what he was up to. When he answered the phone, he seemed glad that I called. He wanted to know what I had done that day and I told him I had workout. Then he asked what I was going to do now, and I told him, "I was going to watch "The Big Lebowski" because it had been laying on the floor for the past five days." Then he said it was one of his favorite movies and it is one of those movies that he would see over and over again. He was surprised that I had never saw that film and he demanded that I see it right away. Pete also said that is was slow at PCR on Friday and it wasn't the same without me there. After that he had to go and I watched the whole film without falling asleep. The film made me laughed so hard especially about the rug issue. It was an unpredictable film overall.   So I like to blame Muni transportation for my lateness at work. I blame myself for being late to work because I am addicted to Music Choice(different genre type music stations with a push of the button) on my cable network and also because I never have time to eat a good breakfast anymore. I decided to make breakfast for my grandmother by making her coffee and scramble eggs with diced tomatoes and bologna.   There's this co-worker of mine named Kristin who is a realist. She can be lazy sometimes especially about her hair. She had the "laundry lady" like hairstyle that day with a blue bandana around her head. She is so mischievous when it comes to bringing food at the register(your not supposed to). Anyway, I saw her blantantly hide a canister of Cheetos behind the clock display. I was shocked and at the same time laughing at her incognito behavior. By Monday, it was still there. She likes to insult me but in a good way because she knows I can shoot her a sarcastic remark right back.   I can't help it if I act like the "Mommy" at the register area yesterday. That is what happened when I made sure Jordana was doing her job right. She tends to forget to invoiced out papers. There is this need of responsibility that I oversee because I am the veteran cashier. And Jordana made me laughed yesterday, not to mention embarrassed me at the same time by chanting a babyish impersonation towards me, she kept on calling me, " BUT MOMMY THIS and MOMMY THAT." She gave me the giggles because she humiliated me in front of customers. I just bear it and grin at the same time. There is a seven year age gap between us, I can expect that from her. I won't see Jordana for a whole month because she is going to have surgery done. So no more "MOMMY" chants for awhile. LOL:)  Mr. Cheshire was in pain yesterday because while cutting wood he got a deep splinter in his middle finger. It is so deeply impact that he is going to have to wait for a couple of days for it to heal. Also, I cut the cuticle of my left thumb  while trying to reach for shopping bags. It was kinda neat though  because both Mr. Cheshire and I got hardware battle wounds. I have a permanent scar from slicing my right hand against a tape dispenser two years ago. Ah! The agony one most go through to work at this dangerous place.     Well Janette is back from her "little" vacation and she makes fun of me for falling asleep. I am not asleep just in deep thought because I am thinking about too many things or worrying so much. It's all good in the name of family. I like to jokingly chant to her, "Remember, you're my second favorite, second-cousin."  We have our payroll accountant who has a difficult name. Her name is Teleza, (pronounced TELL-LAY-ZA, not TELL-LIE-ZA) And that is what happened when Reggie tried to intercom her for a phone call. Everyone at work secretly laughed at him. Poor guy we were giving him such a hard time and not only that he decided to go home because he is still rundown and his voice is still hoarse.  I left work to get my results from my math test on Friday. But I decided to see if PCR was still open and it was. I saw Pete unfolded the tablecloths. We talked for a little but he had to do his job. I say hello to everyone of his colleagues especially his colleague, Pablo. Pablo is this sweet gentleman that is like another uncle that I never have. He knows my feelings for Peter when I accidently call him "Pedro" (Pete in spanish). But I keep reassuring him that we are just friends.  The day is near its end and there is all this fog surrounding the college campus. I want the sun to come back and I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.    Song Of the Moment:  Money, (That's What I Want) by The Frying Lizards  (I think this should be an anthem when everyone is down on cash and also it has catchy 80's beats of a Motown remake)

       Stress Factor And Kill Bill:    Quote Of The Moment:   " Don't be afraid to fail. Don't waste energy trying to cover up failure. Learn from your failures and go on to the next challenge." -H. Standley Judd   I got that quote from work today.  We all know that stress is a part of life. the world is very emotional. I find myself trying not to worry about things like when I thought, I left my calculator yesterday in choir class. Apparently I had left it at PCR when I ate lunch. Thanks Pete! Here's another fist five for you. I am glad I am getting a huge refund enough for me to travel to Hawaii.  So I like Tarrantino movies, especially Pulp Fiction. Everyone at work had been telling me to see "Kill Bill", so I did. And I like the kick butt/slashing gore that Uma Thurman's character, "The Bride" portrays. I never saw the film and I didn't want to spent 4 dollars to rent it. So I bought it at Best Buy for 15.99 compare to other places like Virgin Megastore, that sells for 24.99. The Best Buy offer only lasts one week but so what, I wanted to see it. I let Pete borrow it since he wanted me to know about "The Dude" from " The Big Lebrowski". I figure he should know about " The Bride" in "Kill Bill". I gotta hurry now to see Vol 2 of "Kill Bill". Ciao!

       Blinded By The Light:     Have you ever gone inside a supermarket around 2am in the morning, much less 7am in the morning? The first thing where I feel blindsided is those halogen lights, bright lights that burn through my pupils. It is like an awakening feeling and at times you feel sideblinded and arkward. And damn don't you hate it when you bump into random strangers and you feel like a total idiot. What is more embarassing is you feel numb and blind because you just don't want to be that blind arkward idiot who has to buy a gallon of milk because you don't have anything for your chocolate cake.    What makes me blind are the lights at the computer lab at the community college I go to. Let's say I am writing a paper for class tomorrow and it's due  Do you know how much of a procrastinating idiot I have become? And after staring at the computer screen for too long those lights are f**king blinding you to death, that you might as well get a spoon and take my eyes off. Then there's the squinting and the blinking and then you have an inner argument with your conscious. Sometimes I have to bend my head low so I won't look at the screen much less the ceiling. The point is I hate being blinded by bright lights. Oh and car lights too!  Another Song of The Moment:  "Blinded By The Light" by Manfred Man and his Earth Band

       My Paid Spring Break, Running Into People, Being Persuasive, and Warning Labels:      This Past February I had plan to go to New York again but my plans stopped because I broke my glasses, so I had to postpone. But nonetheless I still wanted to use my Spring Break for something so I decided to paint my room. It took me nearly eight years to decide what color(s) to use. And it took one week to finish my room during my Spring Break, buy hey at least I finally got it done, along with spending at least 100 dollars on primer, paint, rollers, etc. Also the other benefit was I got a paid vacation. No school and no work to think about and it was fun. In the end, I learned from my Aunt Angie that you got to paint the ceiling first. I never painted before so I learned a lot. Now I just need somebody to help me get rid of a lot of junk. I still got some paint encrusted at the crevice of my nails. Oh and the colors are two types of blue and two types of purple. It looks so rad!   I had a six day paid vacation, not bad. So when I went back to work on Sunday and I just like being diligent. At the end of the day, after talking to Ben about his upcoming birthday. I saw an N train and I ran for it. It was a good thing that the driver saw me, so I hop on the side entrance. Where low and behold I saw JohnnyAngel who always recognizes me first. The first time we met I had left my glasses on a potted plant and rode the bus, only to have realized I had left them at the bus stop. I had to backtrack three long blocks back at the scene. I was so worried and JohnnyAngel had nearly sat on my glasses. Luckily he was only a few feet away and we talked and we became instead friends from there. JohnnyAngel has this weird affect on people, he remembers your name(whereas I didn't remember many times after but now do.) and he is like a fungus that just won't go away. You just can't hate him because he is so lovable. We talked until I had reached my stop.  Well being a cashier I have to be persuasive and not only that be a good actress when dealing with certain rotten people. I tend to talk customers into becoming Frequent Shoppers. But the one thing I had ever been successful in when it comes to charm was convincing my friend Ben to work at Cole Hardware. By the way he does an excellent job, he's cocky, a bit arrogant, but  generous nonetheless.   So Vada and I had lunch together again but this time at PCR. I had broken my Lent rule twice but I was so happy to finally have a sandwich. I had ordered the Turkey Sandwich. Unfortunately, Pete wasn't our server, Pablo and Luisa were but we still got great service. Anyway I had asked where Peter was and they told me, he was at the lecture but apparently left. It felt like an unsolved mystery but I can't wait until tomorrow. I hope he is there that is because he's the best, I like his charm. We had dessert too, carmelized pears filling with whipped cream. There was a moment when Vada wanted some water and the waiters had their backs turned. When I saw one come near us I had to be assertive and get some water poured for my friend. Vada liked that and she told me I should be with her when we eat out sometime. Afterwards, we walked around campus and everytime I open a door I had forgotten that Vada was behind me and the door(s) kept closing on her face. I jokingly said, "Maybe everyone in this planet should have a warning label tattoo on out necks." She then asked, "What would hers be?" My reply, "Picky Person" and Mine would be, " Be warned she slams doors and talks very loud." We were laughing our asses off until my dance class started. I have to remember to bring my Mandala for dance class next week. I already know what I am going to do.   Well my body is very sore but it's a good sore from working out. Other than that its yikes TAX DAY tomorrow.   Song Of The Moment:   "I Don't Want To Be" by Gavin Degraw

        For the past month there have been pigeons weezing non-stop at the wee hours of the night. And not only that my landload likes to sleep through informercials at weird hours of the night. I get weird out because I am a deep sleeper and most of the time, but not always I hear him slide his closet door so loud that I think someone is breaking in our house. I want to give him a piece of mind but I can't because he is the landlord or some B.S. like that. So until I am able to move out, I am tolerating it until that fateful day comes.  Well yesterday Vada and I spent at least seven hours together hanging out around school, picking up trash, and talking about what I need to finish to get my A.A. then my transfer and so on. We have been realizing for some time now that our friend, Sara is not a very good friend. She uses people and then discards them. I would be more irate about this issue but this is the internet and I am being more subtle and polite about this issue. I was going to eat at PCR but it was closed. So Vada and I saw this booth, since it was Earth Day. The volunteer rep. said, "That if we pick up some trash around campus, we get a free t-shirt." We did just that under the semi-scorch sun for about 20 minutes or so. I did what I could but I give props to Vada who did most of the work. I was being a bit lazy because it was hot and I was hungry.We got our t-shirts though.  My dreams scare me sometimes because about 50% of them come true. I am not saying I am psychic or anything. I am just intuitive and semi-clairvoyant. They say, "Dreams are the windows to unknown path." I wholeheartly believe it is true, we'll see about that.  I was recently informed that my Cousin Janette, has been promoted to Manager at the Polk St store. I am so proud of her but now she can't  work banker hours anymore (8am to 4:30pm). She now will be a closing mgr, working weekends and getting Monday and Tuesday off. Since she is leaving, I worked with her for the very last time today, I was hugging her so much like she was a teddy bear, that it was very funny. Also, since she has been very dedicated The Bastard and the rest of the managers decided to give lunch with the staff. I hope it wasn't sandwiches from Costco or pizza from Cybelle's because it is usually boring. Nope, we had pasta from Pasta Pomodoro. It was so good. Then again, my cousin got kinda upset at me for delaying my break because I was waiting for the lunch to come, since I leave at 1pm.  I want to put this confession of my workhell site but I will type it here: There is this long time customer named Nancy C. She is this elderly lady who has obsessive compulsive disorder. How do I know she has this mental disease? When she shops and I cashier for her. After I am done with her transaction before she gives me the cash, she takes her bills one at a time. The money is folded in a crease and she swipes each bill twice before giving it to me. And when I give her change back she does it again. I want to pray for her because it is so sad. Well today she gave me some hell today by inquiring about her birthday discount and senior discount when I had did her transaction this past Sunday. She wanted me to calculate with her over the phone about how much her friend owes her to the last nickle and cent. It was so mind boggling that I truly wanted to hang up the phone on her. This endless and irrational phone call lasted for at least twenty minutes.   But the day did get better I think I aced my math test. I hope I ace my math test because I felt intuitively that I got the answers right. I was so psyched that I bang on the desk really hard with excitement. I scare the class a little, it felt good. Then I handed my test over to Ms. Martin and walked out. I walked over to the Statler Area where I saw Pete from a far talking to Carlos (another Culinary student). He told me he missed his lecture about wine and he served drinks today at PCR. He went to some meeting last night at The Red Victorian Hotel, and we talked about his english teacher in which he is failing in. I reassured him that taking 1A can be very hard and it is alright to fail. We talked for a good twenty minutes until he was picked up. So the day was not so bad after all and it's Friday. What to do? I'll probably watch some tv, workout, and do laundry. Until next time!

         So Janette and I saw Vol. 2 of Kill Bill and the end is more longer and has many pieces that put the puzzle together. There was however a scene that was gory that I wouldn't expect but it has to do with a facial body part, one of the important ones. Enough said. I love both of the soundtracks and I can't wait to get them.( Note:   I am obsessed. This film it is now file under new favorites of this year behind "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind") I was so fortunate to get a ticket at 1000 Van Ness  because the lines were long and I wanted a seat. I think I want to see this film one more time before Summer Blockbusters come out, like "Shrek 2" or "Harry Potter 3".    I decided to open up a new blog about work called workhellconfessions.blogspot.com It is about my experiences in the workplace and other work hell confessions that amuse me that I get from craigslist.org under the "Rants and Raves" section. Well, The Bastard has to put eclectic tunes at my workplace because the owner(The Big Chief, we will call him "Mr. Karma Keeper") requested so. So the workplace has spunk now, just the way I like it. No more sad elevator music, I get to hear appropriate favorites. Thank You "Mr. Karma Keeper".  I find that my emotions get the best of me and the only way to deal is listen to music. I feel any type of excuse is something that keeps us from death. It can be a comfort thing, an emotional thing, your worst enemy or best friend.  Some people turn to drugs, food gain, weight loss, cigarettes, etc. In my last post, I said something about stress. It will always be there, you just got to contain it or you will go crazy. There are moments when I feel like I want to start a bad habit like smoking and then I get an epihany:   1. Don't smoke 2. Your friend Pete is trying to quit. 3. Cancer 4. Bad breathe 5. Bronchitis 6. All the bad things you know is bad, bad, bad 7. Don't self- destruct yourself, your better than that! 8. My singing  All the various things that I know deep down that will hurt people who care about me.  Vada was suppose to meet up with me for lunch and pay for it! But I guess she had other things to do. And Erinne, my math classmate was suppose to eat with me but I guess she forgot, again. After I had reminded her twice. So I ate PCR and had the special salad with slices of steak, 3 glasses of Diet Pepsi, 1 coffee, and pumpkin pie. All of it was good. Many, many compliments.  Other than that I saw Pete who gave me back "Kill Bill" Vol. 1 and who ethusiastically wants to see part 2. He really enjoy the film. From afar I was observing him but trying to enjoy my meal at the same time. I felt this empathic urgency in him when I saw his english teacher, Mr. Curzon-Brown walked in. Sometimes when I meet people I have a very intuitive feeling when things don't go right or do. By their walk, their speech, I observe everything. And when his teacher was there I can feel Pete's nervousness around the people he was serving today. Maybe it was because I know him deep down what he is thinking, I could be wrong. And it is not just him but to people I meet for the first time or people I have known for a very long time. I been analylizing people for a very long time, for as long as I can remember. I don't want to turn it to a profession. To put this subject mildly: I know when to walk away or stay and play. Catch my drift. Okay,enough said. I looked at Pete in the eye and I was right. I told him about how this teacher had a lot of controversy in the past, that it was even big for CNN.   I have a lot on my mind but I try not to think about too much, so for now this is it.

       So yesterday I felt kinda bad that I skipped choir class yesterday but don't fret I am singing well. I found myself again at PCR eating the daily special grilled chicken and a distraught hummingbird flying endlessly around the dining room. I felt bad for it, I was afraid it would die. Pete and his colleagues told me it just flew in through the several windows. It was 85 degrees after all! So there I was at my table being served by Tran and getting my water from George. I have now become such a regular at the dining room that everyone who works there knows my name. It feels like an episode of "Cheers". During the hour and half dining experiece I saw that hummingbird fly non-stop in circles. The dining lights were dimmed and and many regulars observed that poor thing to be free. For a moment I felt like that bird. In the process, I was alone eating my grilled chicken and later my pecan pie. All I hope is a glimpse of Peter smiling knowing that I don't get him in trouble or distracted. He did served me water at one moment and he spilled it on my table by accident. All I could do is feel like such a fool and laugh. It can be comical and precious. He then placed a tablecloth like it was patchwork. I know I am a dork but I love eating here and concentrating enjoying every moment life has to give me. On this glorious hot day I was wearing my white halter top and floral skirt. After an hour dining here one of the waiters caught the hummingbird and set it free. But by then the poor thing was so exhausted, one of the waiters gave it sugar water before it decided to be free. Most of the waiters and guests hovered over to a window(Pete and myself included). It was FREE AT LAST! Then we all went back to whatever we were doing after ten minutes or so. I went back to my table and realized I had a couple of pictures and I asked Pete who decided to do a self portrait of us though I think we both blinked. If it turns out bad it will be our best self bad portrait. I had one last photo and I took it of Pete leaving the kitchen table. I left from there, I had to go, no turning back now.   Later I found myself missing ten minutes of math class. Oh I did okay on the test not quite 100% but 88% will do. Oh well, I got this Friday. So there I was in Afro Haitian Dance trying not to lose myself in the dance moves everything from turning and flying like a dodo bird in my moves. I find myself easily distracted when it comes to group dancing because there I am concentrating on what I am supposed to do and then I get exhausted and lost in the feeling or moment. Anyway I had to present my "Mandala". Ms.Watson has some wise words about destiny and fate. It was at this moment I was supposed to meet you, and so on and so on. So I presented my piece and how I spontaneously joined this dance class out of love and fate. I was supposed to be in English 96 but got rejected like so many times before that. Ms. Watson reaasured me it was their lost. Overall I did very well and I am proud. In the dance we were suppose to be throwing seeds I see it as throwing rice. Any wise words that my dance teacher says to me I feel revived.  At work today, Rick F. gave those creditors a piece of their mind for stalking me at work today and past weeks. It scared that operator to death. I saw Nate who I still care about as a friend and I try not think of the bad stupid things I have done to him and what he has done to me. He has changed me in many ways but not many people know about it. We are good co-workers and friends and that is just about it.    Today I am catching up on what needs to be catching up like my paper that is due tonight. I snuck into PCR today and Damn I missed the smoothie special. It was already closed and I got a free cup of strawberry banana. I saw Samantha, Mister, and George whom I talked to briefly. Then I saw Pete who told me that I had to go. (I hope I didn't get you in trouble Pete, if I did I am truly sorry) We fist five each other before I went and I just said to him in  three months from today is my birthday. I'll be 24.

       Quotes of the Moment:  "I love music. Music is the soundtrack to the crappy movie that is my life."-Chris Rock  Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations. I may not reach them, but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them, and follow where they lead."-Louisa May Alcott (Author of "Little Women")     So there I was drinking my white chocolate mocha and getting off the N Line in Cole Valley. The day before I was in my neighborhood, the Mission, I was on 16th street, where low and behold I saw this floored man(looked like he was dead) near The Pancho Villa Taqueria resturant. It must had an overdose or either drank too much, whatever the case everyone, including me was walking past him, just staring blankly. We couldn't believe what we saw, then I heard the ambulance siren and walked home    Anyway I was pacing fast, to start work and my day hasn't even started. Typically I would be waiting at the register waiting for some customers to come. But not this day, it was surreal and I wasn't prepare for it. Some lady had five plants in her hand and my register hadn't been set up. In a matter of ten minutes I had served five customers, not to mention answered phones. Then some semi-regular customer came inside and he must had too much sugar or drank four cups of espresso because he was jumping up and down like he an excited kid. I am trying to get my energy up and he shorts,"QUICK TELL ME WHAT GUMBALL, I 'M GOING TO GET? This is when he is about to deposit a quarter and he points to me, customer#1, and customer#2. He was the talk show host and we were the innocent bystander contestants.Customer# 1 said,(Perplexley) "Uh, Green", Customer#2(nervously) "Uh, Pink", and me(reluctantly) "Blue". He deposits the quarter and what do you know the gumball was blue. He then jumps up and down and demands that I play the lottery, then he calls me"Psychic Kitty". He gives me the blue gumball and I put it in my pocket. I keep it my pocket for seven hours until the end of the math class. This is just another silly moment of what unexpected things happen in my world.

      There is only so much the heart can take. My  Greatest Fear  is being Lonely and not accomplishing all the things I would like to get done before I'm 30 like finish college. I have this fear that I will die young beyond tragic circumstances or selfish reasons.   I was worried about that all weekend, I am a worrywart afterall. But enough about that ....  On a positive note I saw a movie "13 Going on 30" with Jennifer Garner. I actually wanted to see " Mean Girls". I'll probably see it later this week. On Thursday, I went to the Blood Bank to donate platelets (white cells for cancer patients or for people with low blood cells) This process takes two hours, you can imagine how impatient I was but it wasn't boring I had a movie to watch while a needle was drawn into my arm. I watched "Donnie Darko", one my favorite films that I like to classified under "Dark Comedies". That movie plays some of my favorite 80's songs: "Blue Moon" by Echo and The Bunnyman; "Head Over Heels" by Tears For Fears;" Under The Milky Way" by The Church; and the ending song by Gary Jules; "Mad World". I love the last song.   On Friday, I had a math test and I did very well, I got 95%. Then I met Pete and his girlfriend who I thought was very nice. I actually wanted to talk to her more than Pete because he was immersed on his cell phone. He told me some bad news that I shouldn't talk to much to his colleagues while at PCR because they are being graded. I am very outgoing afterall and I told him I would control my overzealous behavior. I left on a good note and we hugged each other where I went to a movie theater and saw my movie. Afterwards, I went to A Clean Well Lighted Place For Books and bought a poetry book. Then I went to Best Buy and bought 3 dvd's and a cd.   Over the weekend I worked and tried not let my inner demons get the best of me. My fears and all. But as soon as I rested I felt better. Then I was informed my once a year favorite co-worker Nate has found better things to do. I am proud of him because he just graduated from Berkeley last December. So I had him do one thing for me, mix some paint for my ceiling. At the end of my shift, we took the N line together because he sold his car. We talked for a bit and then I went home. I was watching HBO and saw Chirs Rock on tv. My favorite rant over his comedic gestures was about relationships. He pointed out at the most you are better off alone because "You ain't never been in love unless you wanted to kill your mate" or "You ain't never going find somebody that likes watching Seinfeld or listen to the Wu Tang Clan" something like that..anyway.. it made me laugh and smile. My emotions were forgotten for now. As Scarlett O'Hara would say, " But Tomorrow is Another Day" and the tragic music plays.  Song Of The Moment:    "Mad World" by Gary Jules (The tune heard in the end of"Donnie Darko")

                    I had been practicing my singing techniques since I spontaneously joined the class because of my friend Sara. I love singing , I've been singing since I was five. At one point, I though I was going to go on Star Search. That didn't happen but nonetheless I still do it as a hobby. It is important that when you sing, you practice, don't drink or eat dairy on the day of the performance, smile, take constructive critism, and most importantly have fun. So on the day of the performance I had invited Pete but he didn't come and I knew it. I wasn't hurt just disappointed but I still sang my little heart out. I met Sara's boyfriend who is twice her age but doesn't look it. She loves him and that is that. I felt bad that my mother couldn't make it because The Giants were playing that day. She did however gave me emotional support and instead Sara's mom and stepfather were there and since I know them I asked them to not only support her but me as well. I had accomplished a lot in that day. In a matter of two and half hours with support from my aunt Nanci. I bought me a shirt to use for choir, buy refreshments, pay some bills, and go home and get dress for the event. The potluck went well and the performance was great. The choir got to perform three times.      I was proud of this certain singer, he had been a more horific car accident than I and still had the warmth and personality to perform, "What A Wonderful World" And "America The Beautiful". Everyone cheer and cry at the same time. It was so emotional.     Later that night I got a ride home with Sara and her boyfriend, Doug, to my house. I am an eternal optimist and it was great nonetheless. I have one more performance until school is over.

                     So after work my mom and I went to this restaurant called "Home". I never went there with my mom. I had been to this establishment before and had steak and mashed potatoes. Not to mention the exquisite banana bread with yummy syrup. I am an only child and I should spoil my mom. I am a part of her. We talked about everything like we always do. The conversation can be intense but at the same time interesting and memorable. We have big dreams but we have to do them even if the greatest challenges get in our way. We must accomplish them together. I love my mother more than anything in the word. The lesson is unconditional love, it takes time but if you are willing to work hard on it. It is the next step to the unbelieveable.

                    The last days of Peter serving me were great. He was actually not my server the whole week I dined at PCR. But dining there was a great experience the only thing I didn't like was his teacher who gave me a look that secretly proclaim: Don't talk to my students. I had almost tried almost everything and I loved the smoothies and the fish specials especially the Mahi Mahi. Any distinct conversation I had with Pete were limited and I was used to him being a flake. It's part of his personality that he does this to his friends, you can't hate him, he has a charming personality. He had informed me that he was going to France for two weeks and I was excited for him because I 've been to that country before. It was good that he was going to France because it was like a birthday gift to himself and he was going to have an input experience as a culinary student the way the french people do their cooking. I don't know if I' ll see him next Fall but if I do I wish him the best of luck.             I was hurt again but I know how to pick myself up and move on.

                I had a wonderful semester, in fact I believe I did so well in such a long time and I am so proud of that. I enjoyed my last choir class. We were just watching the performance on video tape. I look wonderful with my black skirt and white blouse. My eyes aren't close and my mouth not wide. I am in perfect sync. There were very funny moments like after the performances, Sara's tall and volumptous body blocking the filming process and when one student did their solo. The camera person filmed the wrong person, it was hilarious, the whole class laughed very hard.            Later I had a math final and I work very hard on trying to figure out this one problem that if i just redid it over and over I would miss something. I was very anxious and at the same time nervous. I had did my final I was done. To get over my anxiety I went over the computer lab and went on classmates.com. I wanted to find certain people expecially this certain someone whom I haven't seen in such a long time. So I typed in his name and hope it was him and that he would write back. I even reminded him of certain things, I hope he remembered me. So I send a greeting card and just wait.         On Wednesday, one more class until the final I got an A on my report on lunchbox history and had a few grammer mistakes. All I had to do was re-type my work and study,study,study.

         So here I was in my choir attire on a Saturday morning, Memorial Day weekend. I was preparing myself to sing two songs for the City College AA grads. I had to sing the national anthem and this song called "Light the Fire Within". That morning it was chaotic and I was confused I wasn't sure if I had to be there at a precise time, I was game though.    So I took one on the Van Ness buses and got off California Street and waited for a Cable Car to come. After waiting what felt like an hour, only fifteen minutes. I hail a cab and got off near Fairmont Hotel. Right there before me were numerous grads in cap and gown. In my mind I felt slightly envious because I want to graduate school so badly and only a few semesters are keeping me away. I went inside the building and was stopped by a guard wearing starlight glasses, he looked flamboyant in his attire. He wouldn't let me in until I sang for him, so I reluctantly sang for him but in true good spirits.    I was inside and had  met up with the class, half of the class was missing, and I forgot the lyrics to the Star Spangled Banner. I needed to improvised and I had to remind myself that if I couldn't remember, I would lip-sync. We did well the class that is and I made sure to look at everyone when I sang. Even though the spotlights were illuminating and bright.    So not everyone was prepared the whole ceremony was scatter-brain like because it was either we couldn't sit there or stand there. All in all things went swell. The choir had to sing in front of pretty-boy Mayor Newsom. In fact when I left the performance I saw Mayor Newsom give me the once over, he was checking me out. I alos enjoy the compliments from my fellow classmate Curtis Betz, whom has the Hitler haircut and wear "Members Only" jackets. I love his spirit and I felt flattered that he gave me a compliment. Then I got a ride with another classmate, along with Sara, and we got drop off near Church St. Sara and I took the bus where are feet were killing us (we were wearing heels). SHe went home, Iwent home to get dressed and ready for work. It was a memorable moment and most of all the show went on.

                 It was Friday, a night to go to the movies. It was also my day off also until the weekend of The Pride Parade. I decided I must do something until I work  tomorrow. So I went to my old job, AMC Theatres on Van Ness. I got off and there were poltical supporters for John Kerry, democratic candidate. In the process, I saw a huge line, then I remembered. There were people in line for Fahrenheit 9/11, the new documentary from Michael Moore. All of the showings were SOLD OUT. So I bought a ticket to the Nicholas Sparks' based novel, "The Notebook". I still had time until my show started, so I walk around. About fifteen minutes later, for moment a thought a show was available for 7:00 pm. I stood in line until a fellow moviegoer was selling a leftover ticket. I bought the ticket from him, now I was going to see the new Michael Moore flick. The crowd was already gone and a new crowd for the next showing stood in. I walked past the escalators to the top floor.                I reached the concession stand and bought my food. I went inside the theater and saw people had taken the best seats. I was afraid there weren't anymore seats and without thinking I shouted, "ARE THERE ANYMORE SINGLE SEATS?!" Everyone looked at me like I was a crazy person. Most people had thought I was selling an extra ticket. I felt like a dumb ass because I found a decent seat by the stairs when someone had saw me stand right by them. I sat down there mortified, sort of. When I sat down, I heard someone say, "She didn't have to shout like that." Right there, I put my hand over my mouth and made a snicker. I didn't really care.             After five minutes of commercials from not using your cell phone in the theater to seeing a Hershey's kisses commercial twice to watching five coming attraction films. The movie started.          The documentary was awesome,I especially like the behind the scenes stuff before the politcal advisors go on air. Also watching Bush's blank and solemn reaction when 9/11 occurred. Overall this is Michael Moore's best yet behind "Bowling For Columbine".      I remember I had a ticket for "The Notebook" and I was going to get refund but decided not to. So I had some time left, I went to "Mel's Drive In" and bought an Chocolate Milk Shake. I had traded in my ticket and saw the next showing, it was a Friday night, why not?     I watched the romantic film, though I haven't read the novel. It had to be a tearjerker film. Though it was romantic and poignant. It wasn't like "A Walk To Remember" with Mandy Moore. I still love it, nonetheless.      I had my share of watching films, I can't wait for Spiderman 2.

                 So I was feeling low on cash until I received my tax return. I had won a pair of Giants tickets from work. The thing is I missed five innings because I was doing a final that night. I finished my final and The Giants were neck to neck. This was when they were playing The Colorado Rockies. So I got the good part of the game, they were lower box seats and I was on the tenth row near the pitcher's mound. Toward the end, one of the players(I forgot whom)hit a base hit and The Giants won. Two days later I bought good club seat tickets on my own and the game seem like the other team would win. Then unexpectedly Barry Bonds hits number 671 home run. It was against Cinncinati, I think. But the crowd was cheering and it was the best night yet. All Giants baseball fans went home happy that night. I kept the stubs and my mother's friend Kai, who is the game's saxophone player, played my all time favorite tune,"You Are My Sunshine". That night was a good night. This event had happened during Memorial Day weekend on Friday, May 28th.             Last week, Rari, my hair stylist canceled on me. So I did the next best thing. I went to my local hair salon called The Salon and I got my hair done there. Though I admit I paid more there, I at least got my hair done. I got many compliments at work, even The Bastard liked it. I only had two regular customers insulted me. One customer who I will now referred to as "The Hag" called me Wanda the Witch. When she called me that I secretly gave her the F**K you sign behind her back under the register, so no one can see. Then I told my co- worker Priscilla, "Always remember the compliments, forget the insults". I was referencing the song I heard the year I gratuated high school. It was Baz Luhrmann's "Everybody is Free To Wear Sunscreen" song. I love my hair it is me. I am the kind of woman who is the "Middle Of the Road" type and doesn't care what anyone thinks because I am JenniferJuniper.

              About two weeks ago I was checking my email where low and behold I got an email from my old classmate, Nick K. He was my first school crush and we had two classes together in first and third grade. To me he was the nicest and handsome young guy in our grade school in Concord. I never had time to make friends. When I was younger, I never had time to connect with friends because I moved a lot, I was like a Nomad. But Nick was someone I had a crush on even though back then someone would tell me, I was too young for love, much less a school crush.               This grade school story is quite funny, I was eating my lunch by myself and this little girl came up to me. We were talking about this particular teacher that I had for a little while before I left for another school. Anyway she had the same teacher whom I had left for another grade school before coming back to this school in Concord. We were talking about how mean she was and how she looked like and then we went off subject and we started talking about who we liked. I told her that if I tell her, she had to swear not to tell anyone. At the moment, Nick was sitting about five lunch tables from us at the time. The little girl was persistent and with much reluctance I blurted out Nick's name. Her response: OMG HE'S MY BROTHER!               Angela (whom I assume her name was Nicole) went to her brother five tables away. I quickly dumped whatever cafeteria food I had and hid in the girl's restroom until the bell rang. All I had to do was wait in line. Fortunately another classmate who has the same name as me told me to plug my ears and think of a song. NIck was so furious, as we marched back to class. The song I was huumming at the time was The Jets single, "I have a crush on you". A couple weeks later, our teacher decided to rearrange seats and Nick had to sit next to me. Our seating arrangement was shaped like a "T". We had to learned to work together and we did.           On the last day of third grade, I had heard rumors that Nick was moving and my passion for using cameras was the start of a hobby that I still enjoyed to this day. Nick was so camera-shy and I only have this one faded photo of him talking to another classmate. Then Nick had asked if he could take a picture of me, I had loaned him my camera and I am wearing my grandmother's striped shirt. I am taking it with another fellow classmate named Chris Hall and his head is cut off and my smile is quite shy because the sun is in my eyes. That was the last time I saw him until I went on Classmates.com  Out of curiousity I typed in his name and it popped up. I knew there weren't many people with his unusual last name. So I took a risk, wrote him an email, waited three weeks(I never thought it would work.)and he responded.       He told what he did after third grade, he moved to San Rafael (north of S.F.), joined the Air Force (He left recently) and that he lives here in the city. All along Nick lived and worked not to far from me. I have no clue what he looks like now, nor does he remember what I look like either. We were kids when we had classes together and now we are adults. We wrote each other two emails and he gave me his phone number. Then I decided to call him.      When I heard him it was so different, he has a much deeper voice now. We talked on the phone for a good thirty-five minutes and hopefully we will meet up soon. In those precious minutes I felt a connection, I know I can talk to him more now because back then I was so shy and a loner. I have taken all the risks and now it's Nick's move. I hope we have a long term friendship. All I got to do now is wait and see.

               I've been wondering where my Father was for quite some time now. It had been two years since I had the money and the courage to go to him. I had visited him in North Carolina where he had retired as Gunery Sgt for the Marines.He had a girlfriend at the time whom I didn't like because of her style and her voice, it was so hoarse and scratchy like.But anyway I had receive a call last month, he was telling me he was going to see my grandmother first, whom resides in L.A. Then he was going to take Greyhound and see me here in the city. I knew I couldn't truly depend on him to come when he told me, he would be in on a certain day like a Monday. Instead he comes to visit me four days later and I appreciated that. During his whole week here I didn't have much time with him because I was working and I couldn't get out of work because he came in at short notice.        Whatever moments we had together were great, I mean I love my Dad very much even though he doesn't visit or call as often, he is my dad. Anyway when he came and the precious time I had with him. We went to the movie theater and we saw the Brad Pitt flick, "Troy". We also went to a bookstore together and I bought this novel called "The Lovely Bones" by Anne Sebold. It's a poignant novel, by the way. It's about a girl murdered watching everything and everyone she loved on earth in heaven.         My dad told me that he is willing to pay for my trip to see my other relatives and half siblings in the Philippines if I get my passport soon. I told him I wanted to come but the timing is so bad now. I need to finish school.On his last day since he would be missing Father's Day in San Francisco. I decided before he went back to L.A. to see my grandmother. I would treat him to some sushi at my favorite restuarant, Warakubune. I ended up spending a lot but it was worth it, my dad is  my dad. I love him no matter what. One of the  my best memorries is when we were doing laundry together. Even my mother was with us that day, they are still friends sort of. But anyway I got my lesson on folding pants by the sides so that they won't wrinkled. My dad, Mr. I-Always-Have-To- Right gave me his typical lecture. I didn't mind I don't see him as often as  I like to, I am too independent.I guess something as simple as doing laundry can bring out the love for my father.        That night I saw him leave for Greyhound even though there were other passengers that smelled and reek of bad hygiene. We both laughed about it and then we said our goodbyes. He left for his bus, I rode down the escalator to catch a cab.       It's been over one month since he departed for that bus and no matter what future holds in our father-daughter relationship, I still love my dad.

         So I already seen Raising Helen, Shrek 2, Harry Potter 3, The Day After Tomorrow, Saved!, Around the World in 80 Days. Here are my thoughts:    Raising Helen:  So Kate Hudson plays the perky, career-minded, fun-loving younger sister. She get custody of her middle sister's children. There are the challenges in her life that she has to adjust to changing everything around her. She fights with the other sister play none other than Joan Cusack. And has the hot Pastor guy played by John Corbett, from My Big Fat Greek Wedding Fame. It's a cutesy family comedy that can only be directed by Gerry Marshall. Notice:Hector Elizondo is in every fun comedy Gerry Marshall film: Runaway Bride, The Princess Diaries, and Pretty Woman. I give it 3 stars because it wasn't what I hope for.   Shrek 2:  Love the parodies and references to real life like the Cops scenario. The voices of Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers do it again. There were cheesy moments like why did they show an animated picture Of Justin Timberlake, referring to Cameron Diaz's current beau. The gingerbread guy does it again and it made me laughed hard, I wanted to pee my pants. Can't wait for part 3. Four stars   Harry Potter 3:   New director, more darkness. I had the privileged to see it on IMAX. It was especially cool when Harry Potter rides "Buckbeak" on the 12,000 watt HUGE screen. I was hoping for a little more per say because the director did try really hard to follow the book, the brilliant J.K. Rowling. The scene that really got me that made me giggle really hard was the wanted poster of Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman's sinister Wanted Poster made me laugh because his head is turning in every direction in a mockingly way, just for the camera. Four Stars!     The Day After Tomorrow:  So there is no real story but the special effects are cool. It's a typical disaster movie none withstanding since The Poseidon Adventure or Titanic. So what if the world goes through an ice age? I hope I am not around to witnessed this. Hopefully I'll be gone, good, dead, and bury. I can't resist Jake Gyllenhaal eyes. He is the hero and so is his "dad" played by Dennis Quaid. Good action adventure, love the part when the "Hollywood" sign gets blown away and when New York goes through a mind-blowing flood.    Saved!:  Mandy Moore plays a teenage fundamentalist who relies on prayer and God. It had it's momments: Macauley Culkin as the handicapped kid and Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) as the rebel exhiled jew in this Christian School. I didn't like Jena Malone's narration but Partick Fugit has a supporting part. This independent gem should have went a little further with its subject content. My friend Matt K. was so disappointed. Maybe there will be more in the DVD. I would see it again though but it's no Donnie Darko. Three Stars!   Around The World In 80 Days:  Never seen Jackie Chan in a family film before but love the stunts and humor. The animation of traveling around the world is cool, it's the best live action family yet, but I have a feeling it won't do well in the Box Office. The coolest cameo is Luke and Owen Wilson as The Wright Brothers. The lamest is Governator Arnold Schwarzennegger. Did they really go around the world in 80 Days? You have to read the Jules Verne book to find out. Three Stars!  There are still plenty more summer flicks. The Biggest one is of course Spiderman 2 in a week. I am definitely seeing this one maybe in IMAX but not on opening weekend. There are more Summer flicks like White Chicks, I, Robot and few others I forgot. I opted to skip Garfield and Stepford Wives. Who knows? Happy Summer Movie Watching!

             So here's story that is too long to explain and too painful to bear. I like, loved this man named Nate. It was my teenage fantasy and I was sort-of living it out. So why cry his name? He was the best f**kin co-worker I ever had! After all, he made my days better and at times I admit I was obsessed. I didn't tell him this but I did show him the tattoo on my right front ankle. The tattoo means something today, but the point being I had gotten the tattoo on his birthday, Feb. 4th. So now everytime for the rest of my life that Feb.4th comes around, I will not only be reminded that it's his birthday but that I got the tattoo on his birthday as well. Life without Nate? It's been over a month since he left but I'll be alright. Sometime in the future he will come back and everything per say will be different. Hopefully I'll have a boyfriend by then but if not I am not worried about it. I will be just fine, fine I'll tell you, no pun intended       I was a chicken, it was my day off the day it was Nate's last day. The Bastard had mentioned that he was pursuing his MBA in merry ole England, I believe Oxford, eh? Anyway I should had come but I didn't because I knew it would be too painful to say good bye and I was right. So the next morning I am at the register, crying out my inner emotions, trying very hard to keep it in and explain that it was allergies. I felt like Scarlett O'Hara and in the end I said mockingly, "But tomorrow is another day" and I believe this paradox. Good Bye Nate!

               So I've been wondering why I haven't gotten any emails lately, it has been a week and a half. At most times I was wondering what he looked like. I was sure he hasn't changed much then. My old classmate Jessica had sent me a photocopy page of his senior class picture, so I had a clear idea what he looked like now. But then again that photo was taken five years ago, alot had has happened since then.             My grandmother was making tamales at the time and I told her I was going to use the phone since I lost my cell phone and couldn't get a new one until August. Still I was feeling anxious and I wanted to see or hear Nick so badly. I told her not to disturbed me. I was either going to hear his voicemail or his voice.          I dialed those special seven numbers and waited to hear the other line, I was scared, I managed to hold my breathe and sure enough I heard his voice. He was glad to hear from me, he told me he was in Lake Tahoe and went to his uncle's bachelor party. There was a certain hesitation in his voice whaen I asked if he had a good time. I even asked how the weather was. Then I told him about work and he seemed worried when I said, "I would be working on 4th of July and not only that celebrating my mom's 47th birthday." Then we talked about family and yada yada yada, you get the point. There is still so much to talk about and in the climatic phone call, I asked he would like to meet up at The Hard Knox Cafe, near his workplace and have lunch and he said sure. Then we hung up the phone and I was overwhelmed. In my mind, I wanted to play a Franz Ferdinand song, "Take Me Out". The video is cool and yet the song is catchy. I was finally going to meet Nick K. on Thursday. I jumped up and down like a little kid a a candy store, I was excited.

                 Though I am not Gay, I am a supporter. I decided to support my Uncle Ricky because he asked if I would carry a banner for his job along with his fellow drag queens and dukes. I not only participated, my mother did also. I can tell you my mother is wild and more free spirited than I. I am also, bt not as wild as her.                   The day started at 7 am in the morning, I wanted to break my alarm clock earlier because it woke me up at 5:15 am before I dozed off. I woke up later to eat pancakes my uncle had made. As usual my mother tends to procrastinate but this time she did better because she had done her laundry. My uncle had left already by the time it was 9 am and my mom and I left fifteen minutes later.       We walked into Walgreen's and saw our favorite vendor, Christian. In his usual and cheerful presence he rang up our purchases. Then my mother and I took a cab over to Beale and Folsom. The festivities were getting started.       We found the float and I help a transgender put on her rainbow customer on, feather boas, she looked like an NBC network mascot. Then I saw all of my Uncle's friends, they all know him as "Renita Valdez". To me his is my Uncle Ricky, to his fellow duchesses and dukes, he is known as "Renita".         I made the mistake of wearing my green sweatshirt and jeans because it was lukewarm outside, about 77 degrees, I think. I was lucky I had my black bra on and when the 2003 duchess, "Donna Rae" said, "To take it off", I went for it. I wrapped my sweatshirt around my jeans and my cleavage. I get slightly self-conscious because of my breast size.     The whole float waited for nearly two hours until we went on. I had to carry this banner along with my mother, myself, and another drag queen named "Bonnie". "Bonnie", the drag queen is damn right ugly but is indeed a very nice person. He is the ugliest drag queen at least my "Aunt Renita" looks better. But "Bonnie" has yellow-gapish teeth and was dressed like the fairy tooth fairy from a demented hell. I had met "Bonnie"  a couple weeks earlier.      Out 4 Justice was this year's Gay Pride theme because a lot on long-term couples had gotten married. Mayor Gavin Newsom had performed same sex marriages even though President Bush was against the policy. Every individual has the right to get married either if you're gay, straight, or in-between. I had the privilage to enjoy this wonderful event and I hope someday, congress will pass a civil marriage law.       My mother can be crazy at times, as the float was starting she had managed to get a six dollar gay pride whistle for free. It amazes me how my mother get things for free or discounted, she has the magic touch. Her persistence sometimes bothers me but she knows how to get her own way, I do too, but I am more subtle.    During the whole float, I am wearing my black bra and colorful beads. There is this shirtless lesbian in front of me with stickers plastered "Lesbian 4 Sale". I, too is tempted to go shirtless also, but I chicken out. Also while carrying this flimsy banner, "Bonnie" is pushing me aside where I am also annoyed getting my foot stuck along the railing grate althrough Market Street.      After we arrived at 8th St and Market. I am craving for the munchies because it was around 1:30 or 2 pm when we got there. My mother convinces me to get a discount card, so that I can get discounted alcohol drinks. The first thing I get is a five dollar cup of lemonade. Later when my mom and I seperate (She needed to go back home to get more things). I withdraw some cash to buy a chocolate frozen banana with nuts, two bottles of water, fish and chips, a chicken kabob, and two alcoholic beverages; the watermelon Smirfoff kind (vodka) all in a period of two hours. I am a glutton for food and I was having the best time of my life.  The crowds were crazy: naked and creative. I had the enjoyment of watching lesbians, gays, trans of all kind,and straight making out along the Civic Center area and City Hall.      By the end I was a lush, a term use for drunk or plastered. I met up with my mother later on, after laying on a patch of grass while everyone around me passes me by and while listening to Chaka Kahn live at the Main stage near City Hall. I managed to find my mother near the Bud Light stand. She brought my purple lounge chair, so I sat there while my mother got more color beads and bought a funnel cake.  My mother had to sort of drag me to the 49 bus stop at Van Ness. I was wasted until I got to my room.  An hour later, my uncle bought Chinese Food. I was slightly sober then. I watched some tv and went to bed. I have to wake up at 5:15 tomorrow. Overall I had a Glutton Sunday, the best pride event,yet,eh?

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago I had my brief encounter with Nick K. I had been talking about this meeting for a long time. In other words I was excited, you would think I was meeting a famous celebrity because I had told random customers at work whom know for a long time and my co-workers also. I was getting comments about him because of the little story from"OMG he Responed" &nbsp;and because my hair is still&nbsp;highlighted red.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I called him and told him to meet me at the Hard Knox Cafe&nbsp;(a soul food restaurant served by Asian people)&nbsp;. It was near his work anyway and the Asian waitress, Tiffany knew me the last time I came by this establishment before. At first, Nick didn't answered his phone, so after I ordered some drumsticks, mashed potatoes, and macaroni. I decided to call him again he answered and said he would be there in two minutes. I was half way through my meal and keeping things in order, making sure there was no food stuck in my mouth. This was&nbsp; a guy I haven't seen in fourteen years. I see him at the diner and I knew this was him.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walks in looking for me and I immediately embraced him. Man he has strong biceps and he is the right height for me 5' 8" and he is still handsome just like I remember him. He didn't have time for lunch because he had to do deliveries. He has sparced facial hair on his face. We talked and I showed him the pictures. He was so shocked and he is so amazed that I remember so much. Then we hugged and he left. I was satisfied and we need to hang out again.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past week I was asking Nick what did he preferred me to do, email him&nbsp;or call him. He admires both so I email him and we talked and he was telling me about his uncle's wedding that he has to go to in Oregon in August. There is so much I want to talk to him about and asked. I have plenty of time I hope to know him as the weeks progressed.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I decided to visit him at work.&nbsp;First I went to the corner delicatessen and bought a turkey sandwich. Then I get approached by a black&nbsp;male who thought I was very beautiful because he was probably looking at my ass and breasts&nbsp; because I was wearing my turquoise tank top and floral skirt.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Also I had called Nick yesterday wondering if he liked my picture that I had sent him. It was a picture of me at work,I had wrote: &nbsp; "Ok, I look very cheesy but this was taken from my co worker Priscilla on Sunday. Enjoy!" &nbsp; His Response: &nbsp; Nice. So what time is it in Germany? I see all of those clocks behind you. Are you obsessed with time or something? That's pretty cool if you are. Okay well I am at work. Gotta run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left the place and walked over on 22nd and Illinois and impulsively asked an employee if they knew Nick. He did and I was hesitated because I don't like bothering people at work so the man went over and got Nick. I am standing in this warehouse that slightly resembles UPS and I see Nick. We talked briefly, he is wearing jeans and a green shirt that says, "Levi's" I just wanted to look at him and stare him right at the eye. Do we have any connection at all? I believe we do, I just don't want to spoil it. We talked for about five minutes, then I ask him point&nbsp;blankly if he has any tattoos? He does a blade type design on his right bicep shoulder that he got&nbsp;on his 18th birthday. I decided to show him my tattoos; my Chinese monkey symbol and sun on my back. He asked where I got them at and told him it was The Sacred Rose over on 18th/ Guerrero. Then he had to go, I still feel like an idiot for bothering him at work.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; So hear I am listening to music and typing on this blog, I have to buy potatoes for Uncle Ricky's special soup. Other than that the weather is beautiful, almost perfect. The only exciting thing that has happened so far was I heard a lady screaming because some hoodlum stole her wallet and every vendor on 16th street chase that robber and caught him. The lady got her wallet back and I am trying to protect mine because&nbsp;a couple of years my wallet was stolen in this neighborhood . At least the lady had a happy ending and all the vendors and passerbys went back to whatever what they were doing.&nbsp; I want to end on a good note my goal is not to bother Nick until it's my birthday week or prior before that at least. I don't want to scare him because I already love him. Does he know that yet? Only time will tell.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt, my nursery co-worker had informed me that he doesn't celebrate his birthday, it's just another day for him. I thought even though he doesn't celbrate I would at least try to. So I brought the hat, bought him candy sour worms (represents his job occupation), and gave him a birthday card (it had aliens on it) and a birthday page on his day(an analysis). I sang to him like a Chevy's employee and a cheerleader ( though I never was one). Matt loved the gesture and appreciation but went back to work. He has a girlfriend anyway and I am that crazy-employee-that-he-ever-has-had. What was fun though was Laura like my hat and if my hat was a real cake she would eat the cake and cheat on her diet. I want to wear that hat if I have to work on my birthday. Matt wore it for one minute and I wished I had taken a picture of him. The day ended on a good note, I made Matt's day better. I can't wait until I wear that hat!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had won tickets from "The Karma Keeper" to see King Arthur in advance. I knew whom I wanted to invite but didn't have the nerve to ask. It was Nick by the way but I didn't want to bother him so I asked my cousin, Janette but then she flaked on me not once but twice on this get together. The first time&nbsp;was for "Around The World in 80 Days". Anyway, the next choice was Sara. I thought she would say no but surprise she said, "yes". Lately it had been just her and her boyfriend, Doug(or Ma-ug because Doug is his middle name and Mark is his first name)&nbsp;. I told her that if she doesn't keep in touch with her friends and focuses only on him. Then she could lose her friends and if her boyfriend breaks up with her, then Sara will have no one.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hungry because I haven't ate since noon that day. I went to Pasta Pomodoro and had angel hair pasta with shrimp. Then I met up with Sara and we saw the film. We later went back to the restaurant and met up with Ma-ug. I was the third wheel to say the least. I didn't eat much bit had lot of tomatoes with crunchy bread. Then Ma-ug who I confronted about when he touch my ass not once but three times at Vada's party. I had told Sara this she seem slightly concerned but didn't care. She confronted him as well as I&nbsp; about the incident. His eyes had the expression that what he did was true. We both got over it and he was &nbsp;just trying to push me along that night. In contrast he should had pat my back instead. We were all eating and Ma-ug asks that if I was water, where would I be? I didn't know what the hell this fool was talking about. So I said Lake Tahoe where I hope was not polluted and the water was clear. The point being this q and a analysis was a &nbsp;way on how I feel about myself sexually. Doug anaysis was I would like my environment to be tranquil and not polluted. Overall I decided to do this test on my co-workers. &nbsp; Rene(cheshire cat) gave me an anaysis of a Yosemite life &nbsp; Mark (smokey) told me he was powdered water &nbsp; Matt was a freezer surrounded by dead poutry &nbsp; Justin was somewhere surrounded by redwood trees b/c he goes to Santa Cruz often &nbsp; Sarah was steam &nbsp; Laura was hot springs &nbsp; Ben T. was an alpine glacier surrounded by snow &nbsp; My mother a swimming pool surrounded by people &nbsp; I want to try this on Nick but he might&nbsp;think it is too weird.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a couple of weeks ago, I get a call from Vada asking me if I was going to her little gathering that Sara had organized. It was a casual birthday get together to celebrate Vada's 23rd birthday. We (meaning Sara, her boyfriend Doug, Sara's Mom and Stepfather, and me ) were going to this bohemian restuarant called "Fritz".  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A month ago I was mad at Sara because when I impulsively went to Best Buy and knew exactly what I was going to get Vada ( a DVD of "Drop Dead Fred") I opened my big mouth and told Sara this. In turn she bought the DVD that I had intended to get for Vada. I kinda wonder if I should still be friends with this woman, am I a hyprocrite or what? I guess I am.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know better than this so in turn I just made Vada feel better just by coming to her gathering, Vada is the same way, sorta of. I decided to go to this cute gift shop called "Tutti Fruiti" in the Sunset. I just fell head over heels over this very flashy, flamboyant, not to mention cute birthday hat(a birthday cake with six colorful candles and a smiley face puppet hat).&nbsp;I bought the hat for me because my birthday is in two weeks and bought Vada two gifts; an address book(classy quotes)&nbsp;and a Betty Boop Egyptian queen bobblehead ( a reminisent of our first meeting, Halloween 2001).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had belgian fries and crepes, seperated from Sara's parents, went to two very different bars called Zeitgeist and Hush Hush. Vada and I had a few good laughs. I worn the flashy hat as well as she. I took some photos, got recognized not once but twice by customers from work.&nbsp;  I got one free drink and pay for another. I drank a blue hawaiian, (vodka, blue curacao, and pineapple juice) white russian, and coca-cola. I was floored to say the least but overall had a great time because I was wearing the birthday hat. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My good friend, Vada wouldn't had met Hal Sparks if it wasn't for the this Asian customer who came to my job on Saturday. He was one of many coordinators for Aids Walk SF and he needed keys copied.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole weekend was very slow because either baseball games were happening, the good mediocre weather, or special events like Aids Walk. I love volunteering for this cause because it's a crisis period, but also because it's a internal war and I have a heart. This past two years I haven't been volunteering because of work. I started volunteering for this cause back in 1998 and then life just got in the way. Next year, I definitely got to volunteer, it brings my spirits up.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the Asian guy came to my register and me, my happy-go-lucky self who tends to observe little things about people, noticed his Aids Walk badge and I just openly asked, " What celebrities were going to be there?" He said, " Stockard Channing("Rizzo" from Grease), Carl Lumbry("Dixon" from "Alias") and Hal Sparks("Queer As Folk" and I love 70's, 80's, 90's series from Vh1). I knew when the customer had mentioned Hal Sparks I had to call Vada. So I left a message and hope she got it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did but usually doesn't call back and return her messages, she did this time. So I am on the phone with her many hours later, after I get off work,&nbsp; we chat everything, and what our hidden agenda of getting to and from Golden Gate Park. Vada was so estactic because we can totally shove this encounter on Sara's face but we are not going to because we have a conscience.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wants to picked me up at 8:30am the next day, which means I lose about an hour and half sleep and all. But I will do this for her, Vada is so excited and giddy. And after all the directions and misdirections on what to do and what not to do, we both agree on thing: WE ARE MEETING HAL SPARKS! I like his humor very much, &nbsp;that actor makes me laugh and at times pee my pants but I know how to control myself when I encounter celebrities.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Sunday morning I reluctantly get up, I am tired but at the same time I am excited for Vada. At 8:45am she picks me up and we find parking at St Mary's Hospital. We walk around the park and find close seats near the main stage at Sharon Studio. We have a bit warm-up and eat a very light snack as we anticipate Hal's arrival. We listened poignantly to those lost to the tremedous battle of Aids. After all the tears and sadness we see Hal bring out the humor in all us. After listening to the speakers and taking &nbsp;a few photos here and there. Vada and I walked up to the gate near the stage.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see numerous fans wait for him and hyperventilate and their hands shake with sweat and anticipation. I saw one girl who couldn't compose herself. Poor Hal was very nice to the fans and all but they kept on keeping him at one side of the post near the right. Whereas&nbsp; Vada and I waited patiently near the gated front. In the meantime, I shook hands with Carl Lumbry and now I have a one degree connection to Jennifer Garner now. I took group photos of all the celebs . Finally after Vada told me to not act weird or say the word, "patiently" too much. Hal stood up for those fans waitng by the right side and came to the front of the gate.&nbsp; Vada was dressed very casually&nbsp;in her jeans,&nbsp; white tank, and turquoise pull-over and she was so nervous. She was going to meet one of her favorite celebrities. Meanwhile, my eyes were all watery because of stupid allergies and all.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hal finally came to where Vada and I stood. I had him sign my notebook because I was wearing&nbsp;a Coldplay t-shirt that was grey.&nbsp;I had Vada take a picture of us. Geez, I hope my eyes are not close. Hal even wrote my name on the notebook which is very cool and awesome. The funny thing about my encounter with Hal was we were both wearing a &nbsp;grey t-shirt and blue jeans. &nbsp;Then Vada have him autographed her tank top and me take a photo of both of them. I sure hope the photo turns our well. Vada was just so happy because Hal touched her hip so he can autographed her tank. &nbsp;Even though I was already late for work I didn't care, I was going to lie.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After that session, we both walked calmly out of the park. Vada screamed near my ear many times that she met Hal Sparks. She gave me much praised and hugged me to death and screamed many thank yous. I couldn't take all the credit because if it wasn't for the Asian guy none of us wouldn't have met him.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my way to work, I made Vada's day. She won't be a moody and brooding woman for at least week now because she met Hal Sparks. I met Hal Sparks and I lied my way to excused myself from work, I said I overslept even though it wasn't true. When I called to tell my excuse, &nbsp;The Bastard's voice was so condescending. He wonder about my whereabouts. I have to keep my mouth shut and told a lie. Anyway The Bastard will be on vacation for two weeks and I have to deal with Cheshire Cat, Mr. Know-It-All. and Smokey. And in nine days I will be the big 24.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Vada has met Hal Sparks on her next agenda is to meet Viggo Mortensen from LOTR fame and I hope that dream comes true to her. Just like some of my dreams have.

      It was about 8am and I awoke because my mother was trying very badly to entered my room but much ado their plans were foiled. I heard my uncle short, "YOU"RE GOING TO GET IT!" But no my mother was determined and she opened the side door even though my drawer and bobbleheads were blocking the entrance. She whipped slap me like Indiana Jones on the left arm hard. I shorted, "DON'T YOU DARE!". I was trapped but I knew I would have to subtley used the bathroom, somehow. I opened the closet door slowly and crept out of the room and ran to the restroom and back I succeeded. After much room arrest I gave in and took it like a woman and my uncle wham slapped me on the ass and counted it as five spankings. I was in a masochistic mood and said, "BRING IT ON!" It especially hurt at the bottom as this was occurring I was thinking of the film, "Secretary" with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. It was over and then I took my shower. While getting ready to explore my day, I watched some television and saw two similar commercials about getting a massage degree, back to back. I thought this must be a sign or something because this is a profession I would like to get into besides writing. Oh how I wish for some of my dreams to come true and at the same time getting out of this place I called home. I didn't want to waste time it was about 1pm and I left the house wearing the birthday hat.This is when all  the stares and the shorts started to pour in. I walked to Safeway to get my free drink, I got myself a strawberries and creme drink, venti style. I recognized the Starbucks guy and lady. They were glad I came to get my free drink and then an unknown stranger asked, " Where I got that hat?" I told her I got it at Tutti Fruiti at 9th ave/ Irving. This question would be the most frequent answer  that would be asked for me all day. I had my drink and another upon another asked and shouted Happy Birthday to me. I rode the N line and saw the stares. I got off the N and recognized a regular from the Postal Chase, he wished me the same. I walked to work where I saw Rachel and Sunny (He got a new do) and went to the back to get my free movie ticket. Since working here I always got free movie tickets but this year I got free one pound See's Candies. I left the place wearing the hat hugging Cheshire Cat whom I poked him in the eye with one of the candles and hugged Jose. Then I proceeded to the Nursery I had to say hello to Matt whom disappeared yesterday at work for Nursery. I was going to have my five day break.  I walked over to Say Cheese, a wine and cheese store and found out the employee there named  Bob shared my birthday also. I then realized that there are three employees within a block of each other who have the same birthday as I. Bob at Say Cheese, Lisa at Vierra and Friends salon, and me at Cole Hardware. I got a free sandwich and then I went downtown and browsed at Rasputin Records and DSW shoe warehouse. I always feel uncomfortable in the basement area, it's sweaty and clastaphobic like. Janette had called me earlier and I was supposed to meet her at her work. She brought my gift from her and I was afraid I was going to be late. I called her in time and told her I would be there in twenty minutes. I walked to Geary and took the 38 bus. I was thirsty and since I had the hat on, I got a little discount on my Brisk Lemon iced tea. Then I rode the 19 bus to the Cole/Polk location.  The first thing when I walked in was I saw Janette's reaction, she couldn't believe I was wearing such a ridiculous hat. Then she asked for her break and we went upstairs and I got my gifts, a stars and moon photo album, teal blue shirt,my ugly pictures from last year Vegas trip,and a black dress notebook. We hugged each other and I was full from all the food I had earlier. We walked to the local corner store and we saw this very cute cashier who knew it was my birthday (the hat) and he guessed my age also, I was shocked.  I left because Janette needed to finished her shift and I ended buying Unsuitable Men kleenex and I walked to Van Ness. I browsed a little and saw I little girl complimented me on the hat. I rode the bus and got more recognition. Then I walked to 1000 Van Ness and stood in line. I listened to my favorite music and saw all the stares until the movie started. I had ended up seeing an advance screening of the Seth Green film, Without a Paddle. It's about three best friends who take a road trip and very crazy and unpredicable things happen to them. The film was so funny that I peed my pants off.  As the night progressed I walked to A Good Lighted Place for Books and just browsed at the place, I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy a book to read, nonetheless I left the place wishing I had. I walked over to an empty bus stop and decided I would wait. Then unexpectantly a homeless man got all angry because I wouldn't give him change. I am usually good hearted about situations like that but I guess his schizophrenic mind took over and he cursed at me. I wasn't going to stand it and I cursed back then I flagged a cab.  So here I was in a cab with a foreigner who probably doesn't know the city as much as I, I assumed.  I directed him to this gay/karaoke bar known at The Mint. I had to sort of strut my stuff the night was young and this was the night to become me. I showed the bouncer my i.d and all the patrons wished me the same. I bought me a Sierra Nevada beer and Coca Cola. While holding my two drinks I found a spot to sit and I met a new friend. His name is Mark or "English Mark" because he was from the U.K. He was wearing a black "Mickey's" t-shirt which represents beer not the mouse. I have this thing when it comes to English, Irish, and Australian accents and I was smitten.  I choose the song I would sing and waited and waited. In the process, I was getting annoyed by slow mellow dramatic karaoke. The dj was very cool because he never seen my hat. I was having my own birthday party thrown by unknown strangers. Who needs friends? When it came to my turn, I thrive on the attention because it was my night. I decided to sing Pat Benatar's "Love is A Battlefield" and I believed I did well. Otherwise I was going to sing Dido's "Here With Me". Some of the voices I heard were way out of tune or the song was not right for them to sing. There was this one voice whom did a good redition of Tears For Fears' " Break it Down Again" . I enjoyed that, maybe, because I am a Tears For Fears fan, I guess.  Another cool moment was when I finished my performance I got free beer from the bartender and a singing redition of "Happy Birthday". I was a little wasted to say the least but I had two cherry cokes to sober me up because I decided to sing another song. Throughout the night some of the crowd was not into the karaoker but then all of a sudden a group of wild latinos took over the place. They started to sing all their spanish songs in karaoke, it was hard for me to get into the spirit because the only words I know when it comes to spanish lyrics is "Amor" and "Corazon"  .  It was getting tiresome and the night was ending until a group of yuppies did their song and dance redition of "Footloose". Then I got the ball rolling and dance the night away. About eight songs later, it was my turn and I sang The Carpenters' "Superstar". I believe the second song was better because when I did the first song all these flashing lights were shiny on me and I couldn't see.  English Mark was a good sport and he supported me even though he was leaving back to England the next day, I di managed to get his email which I thought was very awesome.  My night had come to a complete end and I walked the lonely street along the Guerrero St side. It felt like a ghost town walking alone until I reached my home and I slept past noon, the next day. The birthday hat is a story that still continues.........

      It was early morning and I thought maybe I'll bring the birthday hat to work and try to convince Cheshire Cat to let me wear it. Not much luck I wasn't allowed to until my shift was over, I was going to have five days off at least. Time at the hardware store was going by slowly, I was being tortured sort of. I had read Good Morning Hardware update and Mr. Karma Keeper was giving away movie tickets to a show for tomorrow, so I made my bid, my birthday was tomorrow after all. I had won the tickets a few hours later and not only that signed up Nick and Sam for a frequent shopper card with the code name known as the 469 Crib. At the end of my shift I grab the birthday hat and put it on. I asked Justin whom I called "J", if I looked stupid with it on? He looked at me knowingly and said, "No, it looks cute on you". I wasn't sure if he meant it or not. The only person I despised most times is Mr. Know It All, he always looks so stern and too serious, half the time I wish I would put a folk up his ass and other times I just want to forgive him. Regardless I gave good bye hugs to Jose and wave good bye to clear blue eyed Ben who has such a deep voice and sometimes gives me the heebie jeebies though I am not attracted to him. I didn't know what to do, so I stopped at Safeway and bought my seventh coffee drink so that I would get a free one for tomorrow, my birthday. I went home, rested for an hour, kissed my grandmother good bye.  I rode the 22 Fillmore to Geary and stood in line hoping to get Jet tickets. Vada had informed me that her sister had her baby, so she couldn't join me and Sara was with Ma-Ug and their friends eating japanese food and going to see Fahrenheit 9/11. So it was me, myself, and I my plans changed. My only hope was going to the concert and not to Trad'r Sam's like I hoped. I stood in line and I knew I was here too early and I needed to take a bathroom break. The place...Perry's Joynt, an ole fillmore ice cream fave. I used the restroom and bought me a cherry vanilla ice cream even though the weather was like 59 degrees out and foggy as usual. Therefore I am such a true San Franciscan. I ate the ice cream, lost my place in line and in front of me were these two girls whom were deeply into magic card tricks. I found out their names were Ann and Marie. They worked at the Exploratorium and cut out cow's eyes very often and do card tricks to young children. We talked and I was hoping and praying that I would get a ticket for regular price. We stood outside for two hours and I got my ticket and also posed for Verizon for a Jet promo. The girls also did a very cool card trick on me and then we lost each other at the venue.  I went inside and I felt so alone yet I promised myself I would have a good time regardless. I bought me a Jet shirt and promoters were selling Jet autographed cd's (cash only). After much hesitation I went to the ATM and withdraw some cash and bought the cd. Not only that I was thirsty and I saw this waitress whom looked like a witch doctor and ordered a rum cola. The problem, I wandered off and when I went to get my drink. She gave me a snide remark and demanded a tip. I wanted to smack that bitch. I needed to find a seat, knowing my height inabilities, I found a place on the side. It was a good spot, then the purple and white lights lowered to a dark hue and the opening act, The Everyones went on. I never heard of them but this band was from Australia and some of their music rocked. Then we had a fifteen minute break and another band, this time from Toronto, Canada named Sloan rocked also. I became a fan sort of, I wouldn't buy their cd, but I would download a single if I owned a computer.  The fans were crowding closer and closer and a customer recognized me from work, I think her name was Liz. She wished me a Happy Birthday! It was about 10:30 pm when the band Jet came on. The first thing I noticed was before the performance of their first song, they sipped whiskey and smoked cigarrettes before performing. They rocked The Fillmore and when they played their hit single, "Are you Going to Be my Girl" I thought of Nick wishing he will asked me that someday. I rocked and clapped my hands off until they felt purple. I had such an adrenaline shock, toward the end of the performance, there were these guys getting high on mocheeba and they offered me one. I was going to go for it but refused what if it was jacked up. The end had come, I got my poster, shirt, and cd and The rockers Jet close out their summer tour in the city. I rode a cab home, after waiting for 20 minutes because I was going to ride a bus. After awhile I caught a cab and found out my driver was younger than me. My birthday had arrived I am 24 now and my agenda had just started. I went home blocked my entrance to my room by opening the closet door because my mom, Beanie and my uncle, Mr.Bobo had spanking plans they were not going to spank me because I would delay it for awhile at least.

      So after writing an update at Cafe Mono, a new found hangout I discovered about a month ago, and that is also near Nick's place. I called Nick up and wanted to know what he was up to, it was a Monday night. When he answered he was mopping his floor, (okay he is a bit domestic, woo hoo!). I asked if I could come over and he said, "Sure" since he told me he had so much to do and he some time for some company. So I pushed "469" and he came downstairs and  we went upstairs and looked at his crib. The first thing I noticed was the wine bottles and 42 ounce bottles on the kitchen cabinet. To my left as I climb the stairs is the kitchen and porch, to the north is Nick's room and the living room, to the right is Sam's room(his roommate), bathroom, and an empty room. It's a huge place. So Nick and I talked and talked. We got interupted twice, first by his landload, regarding his garbage bill and then by his guest who flew from San Diego. Nick introduced me to his roommate, Sam whom was watching the Giants game at the time. Sam was this nice guy who knows Nick from soccer at Nick's school in Terra Linda in San Rafael. Sam was a quiet and shy fellow we talked for a bit and how I knew Nick back in first and third grade. While talking to Sam, I noticed Nick's computer and how it had a Matrix screensaver. I actually found someone who knows what P.I.T.A. meant (pain in the ass). Some of Nick's secrets and we overall have a deep understanding of each other. I asked if I made more I would become his roommate if he wanted me too. During our whole conversation I would do my best to become intimate with him and looking at him straight in the eye. We talked about almost everything from school, military, family, and traveling. Another thing I found out about him was that he smokes. I should get off my pedestal horse and realized we are not all perfect. I still want to be his friend regardless. He admires my memory and I admire his individuality and his hard working stride. After two hours at Nick's place I felt the need to leave because Nick's guest had arrived, Nick needed to take a shower, and I needed to call home, it was getting late. I had a long ride ahead of me. Nick told me he had so much to do with the guy from San Diego and him were driving south to San Diego and back. I left on a good note and he wished me an early birthday. We hugged at least three times! He warned me not to have a Scorpion drink at Trad'r Sam's the bar establishment down below his place. I had asked his roommate Sam how do they sleep through the noise and all. You just get used to it ! I hope I get to come back to his place someday again because I still would like to know what kind of music does he listen to when he is on or off the road.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is or ever be predictable in my life, it seems most days my life is plain unpredicable. Expect the unexpected!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had&nbsp;a &nbsp;great moment for Mr.Know-It-All, he always inquires where I am going, why I don't wear my headset like I am supposed to, and anything business like, in other words he a narrow minded bossy head because well he has to. Earlier I had the privilage to buy Harry Potter jellybeans and one of them tastes like real dirt, sardine, or buttered popcorn. They are unusual flavor jellybeans and I enjoy striking out my petty revenge. So I had the privilage of giving Mr.Know-It-All a&nbsp;"Dirt" jellybean and boy he didn't like it! I had my moment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I been trying to reach Nick but there hasn't been much success and I don't want to be too persistant because then I will scare him away and I don't want to lose him as a&nbsp; new found old classmate/crush/friend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Catwoman because the earlier showing of The Bourne Supremacy was sold out and when I did see a latter showing, the movie made me fall asleep and it made me dizzy too. It was the camera movements and the fight scenes that kept on spinning uncontrollably it had reminded me of the time I was at Todo Santo Park, in Concord, when I was 9.   &nbsp;&nbsp; I called up old classmates like Jessica and heisitantly I called Pete also but our conversation was brief. I am so over him but I will be his friend if he ever needs one and I know he will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I've am ridiculously popular in The Cole Valley neighborhood, I go on myspace.com practically on every hour upon the hour, been watching old episodes of Nip/Tuck on my DVD player, having the urge to try a new job because I need a new beginning, hmmm that's just about it but other than that I will 24 in a couple of days.&nbsp; I guess I'll just be spontaneous and all. Peace and all that jazz.......
