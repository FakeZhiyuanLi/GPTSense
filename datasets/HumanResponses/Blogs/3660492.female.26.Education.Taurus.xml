						   I can't even set this up properly, so I'll just let you read it.   Headlining an appearance with other Democratic women senators on behalf of Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is up for re-election this year, Hillary Clinton told several hundred supporters—some of whom had ponied up as much as $10,000 to attend—to expect to lose some of the tax cuts passed by President Bush if Democrats win the White House and control of Congress.   “Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you,” Sen. Clinton said.  “We’re saying that for America to get back on track, we’re probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."     WHAT!?! I don't believe she had the balls to even think something like that, much less say it out loud at a fundraiser! Are liberals so stupid that they actually applauded for this nonsense? Were there no little red flags popping up around that room? Libs, here's what you don't get. You work, and for working you earn something called  money . You can use it to buy things. Buying things helps the economy. If you put money back in, the government doesn't have to take so much away from you. Everybody wins. If the government takes the money you worked to earn, they spend it on big programs that give your money to folks who don't work. That's the "common good" she's talking about. Now, call me crazy, but that just don't seem fittin' (as my grandmother might say).    Libs, take the tofu out of your ears and think for a change. Where does Hillary get off saying that they know what's "good for you"? (Last time I checked, she wasn't running for president until 2008.) I'll let you in on a little secret---she doesn't know.   I was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas and lived in a tiny little town named Paragould. Bill Clinton was governor and the state was in the shitter. Education in Arkansas was ranked 48th (thank God for Alabama and Mississippi), so, naturally, Bill gave the job of cleaning up education to his wife. I guess it was because she had ABSOLUTLEY NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT! She must have known exactly what to do, right? Wouldn't want to give that task to former teachers who'd been in the trenches and knew what their co-workers and students needed to succeed now would you? After a year of Hillary's rule as the head of the education department, Arkansas did not climb up the ranks. We slipped to 50th. Yes, dead last. Past Alabama and Mississippi if you can believe it. She plans on doing the exact same thing for this entire country if she (God forbid) ever gets behind the big desk.  Now that this rant has shifted from Marxism to Hillary, I guess I'll pose this question. When did she become qualified to be a senator? Most folks work their way through the ranks--they sit on school boards and work as members of city councils. Others are lawyers and doctors who work closely with politicians, but where did Hillary get her clout? She worked as a crooked member of a crooked law firm, rides her husbands britches, which are dragging on the floor behind him as he screws every intern he can get his sweaty hands on, and lands up in the White House. Does she stop there? No! She buys a house in a posh New York suburb and wheedles her way in through folks too stupid to see what she's up to. Now she thinks she is fit to be the first female president. If that's true....then I'm Barney's lover. I mean it. Both concepts make me quite ill.  Oh, and about the sweaty hands bit. I know it for a fact that he has them. I met him when I was in third grade. All I remember was that his shoes were shiny and that his hand was sweaty and clammy. I just thought it was gross at the time, but knowing what we know about him now...it's downright disgusting.

						   Since May, all Hollywood has been able to talk about is  Fahrenheit 9/11 .   "Oh, it will change hearts and minds..."  "It's the truth behind 9/11..."  "Oh wow, this really showed me what's going on in Washington..."  "Moore is a visionary..."  "This  documentary  is stunning..."  (Note the emphasis on the word "documentary." That should read "propaganda.")  **Sounds of this blogger puking her balls off in the washroom**  Whoop diddy doo. This asshole makes a cheap film, markets it low cost to his producers, and makes $21 million dollars! Stop the damned presses---the earth has shifted on its axis! Well, let's put all this Cheeze Whiz in perspective. Yes, this is the heat of the summer movie barrage; however, many of the big hits have already made their debut or they have yet to come out.  Let's take a look at what Michael Moore's holy grail was up against on its opening weekend.   1. Fahrenheit 9/11 --$21,800,000 2. White Chicks --$19,600,000 3. DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story --$18,500,000 4. The Terminal --$13,900,000 5. The Notebook --$13,025,000 6. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban --$11,420,000 7. Shrek 2 --$10,500,000 8. Garfield: The Movie --$7,000,000 9. Two Brothers --$6,210,000 10. The Stepford Wives --$5,200,000  Now I'll stop. It only gets worse from there on out.   Well, well, Mr. Moore. Congratulations. You've successfully bashed in the head of the movie industry. I don't know how you managed to do it what with such Oscar worthy films like  White Chicks  and  DodgeBall  breathing down your fatty neck. Wow. I'm so stunned by your success. It almost looks as if you planned this so your movie would look more important than it really is. If you had decided the Fourth of July weekend was more appropriate for your film you'd have been up against  Spiderman 2  or  King Arthur  you know...stuff people actually want to see. Smart planning, you tricky bastard. I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but your film will be forgotten as the summer drags on. Unless, of course, the liberally biased media keeps the hype at this fevered pitch. Some of them are embarrased by you now. Hell, you've insulted all of us with your words, and my ears feel raped from having listened to your venom. Oh, you didn't insult us you say? Let me remind you...  This is a quote from "THE AWKWARD CONSCIENCE OF A NATION" published on Nov 3 2003 by Brian Reade.   According to Michael Moore:   "We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing.  National Geographic  produced a survey which showed that 60 percent of 18-25 year olds don't know where Great Britain is on a map. And 92 percent of us don't own a passport."  Since when does passport ownership determine your IQ?  Oh well, hmmm...perhaps we're too ignorant to understand your great work, and I don't feel like I need to plunk down $10 of my hard earned money for some fat asshole who thinks I'm stupid for being a Republican. As a matter of fact, not only am I a Republican. I also can find Great Britain (and a great many other countries) on a map, and I do own a passport. I used both my knowledge of geography and my paperwork to travel to Paris and London this summer. After seeing what Europe has to offer, I have never been so grateful to be an American.   Michael Moore, if you want to make a documentary, make a documentary. I can't stop you. However, don't label this film as unbiased truth. That's the kind of lie that puts you in the express lane to hell. This film contains the antithesis of truth, and the "stupid" masses you are so "embarrassed" by are the only ones gobbling it up.

						   As Bush arrived in Ireland, he was met with a crowd of protestors. They hate him. They hate the war. In short, loyal readers (whoever you may be), they hate us. For no reason. Protestors of this war say Bush is taking human rights and pitching them straight into the fires of hell. Forgive me if I'm wrong on this one, but wasn't THAT what Saddam was doing when he threw men, feet first, into wood chippers in front of their wives and children? I would call raping a woman to get information out of her husband a bigger infraction of human rights than the liberation of an oppressed nation. There are actually fools who are so weak minded that they actually confuse the two.  They want us to feel bad for the terrorists because they are an oppressed people; they are frustrated revolutionaries. When the time comes, and we leave Iraq to govern herself in peace and plenty, what will they say then? What negative spin can they place on that situation? The world is evil folks, and growing more so by the day. I'm just waiting for someone to start dragging a square of marble back up to the temple mount. Good thing too. I'm ready to go to heaven.   People are SO against war that they protest one done for the right reasons. No one in their right mind can tell me that Saddam wasn't a despot, or that he wasn't burying his victims in mass graves. How can people, who say they care about human rights, honestly protest a war that took a man that evil out of power!? It makes no damn sense to me at all. I was once proud to be of Irish heritage, but between this little stink and the torture of reading James Joyce I say fuck the Irish. I'm American and proud of it.   I've got my head screwed on right. I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.

						   For those of you who know anything about me, you should know the "Bill Clinton" orgy going on on the top of my blog pisses me off. There is no way I would buy that doorstop, even to set it on fire! Why do blogs feel the need to slap an add on our sites anyway? And if there really is a need for them, why won't they be bothered to assign them correctly!?!? If nothing else, my site should be hawking George Bush 2004 items or a Reagan book or something. Even Blogspot is hopeless. Argh....

						   I recently gave my students a journal topic titled "Are you political? Why or why not?" I expected to get a stack of journals full of pre-chewed news bites and I wasn't disappointed! Some of my students wrote phrases like "George Bush is a liar," "He started the Iraq war for oil and he taxes poor people," "He's killing fathers and mothers for his own gain in Iraq," and (my personal favorite), "George W. Bush is an idiot. Bill Clinton was the best president of  all time ." When I asked the student to clarify the last two words, meaning since George Washington or in the 20th century, he replied, "Ever. He was the best president that ever was."  After I passed out cold, I got up and continued with the lesson.  I swear, how am I supposed to get these numbskulls to understand that the media is nothing but propaganda and that what they believe to be fact is nothing more than a skewed version of the truth? My students bitch about the fact that they lose a huge chunk of their paycheck to taxes, but then they vote for a Democrat who will only raise them! I try to tell them that Republicans believe in lower taxes, but it doesn't seem to sink in. We also had a discussion about gay marriage, which most of them are  against , but again...they plan on voting for Kerry. The argument was divided over abortion, but that was to be expected. Also, more than half of my students are professing Christians, which makes me unbelievably happy, but I can't rely on that to see them to the political truth. Many of them just simply cannot understand the true nature of the political beast, and no matter how calm and collected I am during the discussion, I just end up with one whammy of a headache.   Truth be told, I would love nothing more than bashing John Kerry in my classroom, but then I think about all of the professors I have that bash Bush when I am a student in their class. I think back to all the times I have had to bite my tongue and listen to their drivel in order to save my grade and how angry it makes me, so I take the high road and refrain from my natural urges. In the end, most of these kids are going to go out and vote for a man who does not agree with any of their beliefs, and it's all because of the media's power to blind folks to the truth.  On the opposite side of the journal writing coin, I had a slew of apathetic writers. Their entries were also riddled with the catch phrases of a brain numbed generation. "Politics is all corrupt, so why should I bother?" and other blather like that. Honestly, I don't know which one I hate worse...the misinformed or the uninterested. All I know is that I have a long road in front of me, and every class I teach will be filled to the brim with students just like these. How long will it take before their kids come down the educational pipe, and what will we do if this trend continues?

						   I knew it was coming, but I didn't know just how confusing and boorish the whole situation would be. Bill Clinton has now released his memoirs (or book of lies as I call it), and the entire media is in a frenzy. However, it isn't all orgasmic like it was when he was president. Some folks are just fainting in the aisles to get his signature, while others, like the  New York Times , are panning his book in order to take him out of the limelight.    Poor John Kerry can't get a word in edgewise! I can just see him standing outside of the pool of light that Bill Clinton is hogging, waving his arms around trying to get people to look him with his "Lurch" face and listen to his ever-changing message. I swear, he has no original ideas of his own. He has no vision. He's just an aging hippie whose causes have all died of starvation.  But back to Billy Clinton...  He was on  60 Minutes  last night. Don't ask me about the interview because I didn't watch it. An entire hour of Bill Clinton and his shiny red alcoholic nose would just about put me into convulsions. I do have my health to think about. However, I did see the clips on Fox News this morning as well as several interviews by PR pros. The interview was like a watching a T-ball game. There were no really hard hits, no one was running the right way to chase down the ball, and everyone was overly concerned that no one's feelings got hurt. Ick. I don't know why Dan Rather (whose suit matched Bill Clinton's perfectly) didn't just get down on his knees then and there. Then again, that may have happened after filming wrapped. You know how kinky Clinton can be, and I bet he's not getting any from the ice maiden either. I hear she's running for president soon, but that's a topic for another blog.

						   I'm sure I'm going to get some flack for this, assuming of course, that anyone ever reads it, but I'm tired of dealing with wishy-washy liberals. All day long, I listen to co-workers and teachers blather on about how wretched President Bush is, but if I even think about uttering a harsh word about Kerry or (God forbid) Bill Clinton, I'll be run out of higher education on a rail.   I happen to  like  President Bush. I happen to want a president who thinks to pray before he makes a major decision. I actually don't agree with turning our great nation into a welfare state full of happily married gay people. (Look at the plumbing here folks, no matter how hard you try you can't make two male adaptors fit together.) As I watched the week long tribute to President Reagan, I remembered just how great he was for our nation. Jimmy Carter, a nice man but a horrid president, was all doom and gloom. His speeches were about as uplifting as a spinal tap, and the nation was basically down in the dumps. Reagan came along and gave us national pride. To this day I am not ashamed to fly a flag, and that is due directly to Ronnie. In Europe, I carried a backpack with an American flag nametag on it. Several folks gave me dirty stares, but I didn't mind. I'm proud to be American, damn it, and I think that is how it should be. Period. Now we face the summer long Clinton love fest--my barf bag is at the ready.   I plan on ranting like this often. Republicans, we need to go on a scavenger hunt for our spines, and I'll be the one reading the map.

						   Praise God and pass the ammunition! John Kerry has finally picked a running mate! Just two days after giving John Edwards the nod, the two have begun working together for, as their signs say, "A Safer America." (Yeah right.) I know these guys are just chompin' at the bit to put their heads together and plan how to best throw American straight down the toilet, but have you also noticed how often they touch each other? Makes one wonder, does it not? Well, it's all falling into place for me now. Kerry is a gigolo---he's married two rich women who buy him houses and cars, and now he's hooked up with Edwards, his new trophy wife. I mean, come on, the guy made all his millions by suing big business! And he has the gumption to say he cares about America!?! No. He doesn't. He lined his own pockets with the money that should have gone back into the economy, and folks want to put him and his lover, Lurch, in the White House! Egads!!   Honestly, I don't know which one of them is worse. Kerry is a waffle maker, and he's turning little John into one as well. Up until the election year, John Edwards was a real war hawk! I just recently saw an interview John Edwards did with Chris Matthews on  Hardball  before the war in Iraq began.  He said, and I'm not making this up, "Saddam Hussein is the greatest threat to Americans in the world today. Something must be done." No lie! And now he's spewing Kerry's anti-war sentiments in an effort to appeal to the frazzled fringe of the Socialist, I mean Democratic, party. It's just like Joe Lieberman four years ago. He's a little off in places, but at least he was truthful...a stand-up kind of guy. I could tolerate him, but when Gore got his claws firmly planted in his double-breasted suit, the lies just started spewing forth like pea soup out of Linda Blair in  The Exorcist . John Edwards decided to make a run for the White House because he  knew  that he couldn't win a re-election bid in his own damned state! What does that say!? Honestly, they'll get the running mate and convention bounces, but I don't think this race will even be close when all the votes are counted...if, of course, the press doesn't call every single state at 7:00 P.M. before the polls even close, which discourages voters that are heading for the polls after a hard day of work from going by. Clever trick, you lying bastards.

						   Seeing as how it's the Fourth of July and all, I thought I would post a little piece of our nation's precious history here for all to see. Pay special attention to the last paragraph or so. It's important.   Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775.   No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.   Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.   I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!   They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.   It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!    God bless America...I only hope He still feels the need to aid us in our battles against evil.

						   It's a holiday weekend, and I feel moved for a lighter thought on my blog. Thanks be to God, there are some things in the news today that still make me smile. Here's one from Hong Kong (via myway.com):   Angered by Beijing's decision ruling out full democracy in Hong Kong, hundreds of thousands of people marched Thursday to demand the right to choose their leader.  "We don't want to be subservient to the central government," said Ben Kwok, a 40-year-old factory owner, as the crowd clogged streets and turned much of downtown Hong Kong into a sprawling but peaceful protest zone.   See that folks? That's what we once were! We once wanted to choose our leaders; we took pride in our right to vote. We once, how did that wonderful sage Ben Kwok put it, "didn't want to be subservient to the central government." With the Fourth of July coming up and the election looming around the corner, I could't help but think about our great nation and the changes it's going through. No longer are people eager to express themselves at the polls, but I can tell you something right now--I am damn ready to do it. I'm already working at voter registration tables, trying to get folks lined up to re-elect George W. Bush, and sharing my knowledge about politics and culture. Today I shared my opinion with a student, and he seemed surprised to learn things that I took for granted. Let me give you an example, we spoke of faith and when I mentioned that George W. Bush led Bible study classes in the White House and that he prayed each and every day, he seemed shocked.   "I never knew that," he said.   I replied simply, "Baby, you never hear it because the press  doesn't want you to hear it . You have to dig for the truth nowadays."   He seemed open to new ideas, and maybe...just maybe...I've changed a young mind for the better. That's why I teach. That's why I'm proud to be an American. I could hold that conversation in the open and not worry about the thought police chasing me down for trying to spread the truth. America gives me that freedom. On the 228th birthday of our nation, I am moved once again to thank God for all His blessings on our great land. May He continue to do so for all time.   Amen.
