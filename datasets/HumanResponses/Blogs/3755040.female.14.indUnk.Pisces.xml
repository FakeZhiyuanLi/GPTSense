      THIS my friends... well, this is my best friend. lol. my favorite is the one in the right hand corner. you know what these pictures inspire me to be? a photographer. but no body know's it but me. and well... whoever read this. she's beautiful.what reeeeally caught me off guard about these photo's, where that they didn't look like her. i mean, in the right bottom one, you can see her eyes. the left bottom one is like... wow. all of them are wow. cept the left top one, i like it because it's different from allllll the other pictures i've had of her. and she took it. =) i'll stop talking now.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       urlLink    can you believe that these are all the same baby? I miss Graysea (as in Gray-C). We've had her since she was born. *sigh* I miss her. She was like... my baby... my little one. I hated to see her go. But I couldn't do anything about it.&nbsp; urlLink

      I feel empty somehow. This picture was chosen by me because I love it, it's absolutly adorable. That's Graysea. She's with her new parents now... I miss her. But anyway. *sigh* I feel empty. Because no one know's what it's like to be me - live without my best friend. Ok, that may sound weird, but I love her. And we're spending time apart, well, lol, apart from talking to each other. She's got camp all next week. What am I going to do? I've got my grandfather coming... he's a photographer, so that'll keep me occupied for awhile. I'm not allowed on the computer for awhile, so I wont be posting for awhile. But I'll be content just being with my family and things... but that isn't enough. Can't anyone try and understand that? I miss her... I miss talking to her... I wish she was here. Or we were together at least. I'd be happy. Really I would. But Australia is far, and so is Novemeber, where she comes for two months... *sigh* Problem unsolved.  urlLink     Die an Early DEATH

      This is Colten, Tami's kid. He's five years old, and sooo cute. I've spent two six hour days basically with him and cute little kids JUST like him. Tami is awesome too, she and I wrestled today, and she's 37! I think camp for the next 3 days is going to be awesome... isn't he so cute?  urlLink     Die an Early DEATH

      Guess what everyone!!! There is a time in a person's life, that when it gets all dark, and then they go and find what we call a bed. then they lay down, because that's what you do, then you shut your eyes, and hopefully you're experienced enough that you'll go into something we call 'sleep'... It's sleepy time for me!! Don't ask about the picture, it's the only one I have of me and the baby (that's not mine) That fits. I feel a little better by the way. Oh, and my eye doesn't usually look like that. I don't know how that 'bump' think came to be there. Maybe it happens when you're sleeping? Oh well, I don't know...  urlLink     Die an Early DEATH

      I chose this picture because I'm happy there. I'm not happy now. I mean, I'm playing my guitar, Singing, and just having a blast. Now every - about 2 minutes - couple of minutes I just want to cry. I remember when I was ice -eyes. No chance whatsoever for tears. None at all. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      This is MY Best Friend. lol. There isn't much to say except that I love her. I mean, if I were to explain why I love her, and all that, that'd take ages. But I will tell you this. She is the most amazing person I've ever met; her heart is pure, and she loves the way I am. Only a couple people could mean that. But, only Rosie shows it.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Rosie - If you get this, then I guess you're probably wondering why I'm putting this picture up. I love this picture. I just wanted to make sure you know I love you, no matter where life takes me, and no matter who else will try and convince that our love is wrong. Looking at this picture I understand some things I never thought I would understand. You helped me fix my life. My back was turned on reality and you turned me around, and made me face it. For that, Rosie, I will love you forever.   urlLink     Die an Early DEATH

      You know what's funny about photography? You never expect what you want. You want it to be great, and yet you expect it to be bad. Does that make some sense? I took this photo. and it was light as hell outside. yes, that's right, it was outside when i took this.  urlLink     Die an Early DEATH

      Notice the book, notice what it say's, "FEARLESS" It's a good book. Now I wish that applied to me. Fearless. I wouldn't be scared of the dark.                                                                                   Thinkin about it tho, you know how it feels to be afraid? It scares the shit out of me, because I know that I'm about to loose something that means something important to me.   urlLink     Die an Early DEATH
