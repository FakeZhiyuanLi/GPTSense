      Welcome to Spyro's blog. I don't care what you think about it, b/c I probably don't know you from Adam, and I would guess that your opinion sucks.  A little about Moi, before I get the chance to rant about this pitiful country.  I am NOT a blond, nor am I Polish. I won't mention the violist side of me, b/c that's scary, and although scaring people randomely is a crapload of fun, it is not called for at this present time.  My life revolves around my cello and all that is related to it ~ any time I screw up in performance, I blame Bush or Janet Reno. Grace, a dear friend, has (unfortunately for those who value their sanity) had a profound influence on me and therefore will be regarded with utmost respect on this page. Thank you, Grace, for your ideas and insane info that I could have lived perfectly fine without. You're the bomb. School, in my mind, is slanted and lame beyond belief, but important to my future, thus I strive to do well, even though I despise it because it takes time away from obsessing over my cello. Because my Chinese astrology sign is a dragon, I believe that I am lucky and that I should take every opportunity to (naturally) spread my luck around. That is why I will always wish "the luck of the dragons" to anyone who qualifies. I am half-German, Native American, British, and about a zillion others which all aid in my falling under the title of "Mutt". Recently I've become aware of the fact that it's really my job to dis as many people as I possibly can. Thus, I will do so and will enjoy every minute of it. Booya.   More later when I have a decent amount of coffee running through my system.

      Ooh, I'm good. I am so tired. But I have good reason to be!! So here's how my last few days have gone ~~~ my family's string quartet has been preparing for a wedding this weekend, and being as my sister just HAD to go and get married (split up the quartet in the process), we've always been short one musician. Well, Travis (our favorite one to play with) is on vacation, Linda is taking her daughter to college, the other lady is on vacation, and Sally is also on vacation, so my mom calls up a 2nd violinist from orchestra (and, of course, she doesn't have a clue as to how good/bad this lady really is), says "Hey, you're hired" ~~ good, yes, but then we practiced with her. Hmm. To say this nicely......Oh, I won't even try. She sucked and we're not going to play w/her. Next I call Spencer, who is chill with the idea, but thinks we'd be better off playing w/Grace cuz he's not too sure about the music. So I call Grace, who says she's love too, she just has to check with her mom. Calls me back, turns out her aunts B-day party is in the way (I'm STILL mad about that one Grace! Or, more appropriately, Ruth!), so she can't do it either. Grr..... Now I'll be playing w/Becky ~ which is finally cool. Also, the bride wants a certain piece played for the bridal procession that I can't find worth beans (haha Robbie ~ BEANS. Haha). Crap. AND, the wedding is freakin' 30 miles from the Canadian border. Contrary to popular belief, I do NOT live up there. Oh yes, so then my brother-in-law just HAD to return a letter my mom sent them as part of the "Slind/(my last name)-family Peace Process". So she was all stressed out, Micah got pissed off at everything, Sam kept talking about doing something nasty to Jess's house (like taking Sean's idea seriously ~ not a good thing ~ painting their house mauve w/orange trim), it was flippin' hot outside, I didn't get a full cup of coffee in the morning, and of course, the whole Bush-might-just-be-president-again nightmare is lurking at the back of my mind 24/7.  I also practiced cello for 6 hours.  Me be NEEDING a paintball match. It's about time to kick some ass.  If leaves grew on rocks, then the hermit-crabs would be content.  Gute nacht.  Spyro

      Okay, so you know that Bush is planning on bringing back 100,000 (or whatever) troops back from various countries around the world.......But do you know WHY???? Heh. Here's my views: Bush is bringing the troops back to send them all to Iraq, after he brings the troops that are already there home, so he looks like an angel. OMG. What is this country coming to? So don't believe him when he goes on and on about bringing the troops home. We'll probably be in Iraq for years. Bah. Iraq will grow stronger and stronger, and pretty soon they'll make a kick-ass army, and----well, you know what comes next.  Just a thought......  Spyro

       This is a warning about a church (aka a CULT) named The Congregation of the Firstborn, which meets in the building of The Friends Church every Saturday. They call themselves "Torah-observing Christians", and are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Contrary to what they would have YOU believe, the congregation is anti-Semitic, thus I find it my obligation to warn you, and any other searching for their web site, of this cult. The definition of the word CULT in the Doubleday Dictionary (closest one I could find) is 1. A system of religious observance. 2. Extravagant devotion to a person, cause, or thing. 3. The object of such devotion. 4. A group of persons having an excessive interest in something.  And, while this pretty much covers all religions, let me give you a few examples where this church has proven itself worthy of each definition, therefore the title Cult.  1. They are, in fact, a congregation that meets weekly in a home or in the building of the Friends Church to discuss Torah and the New Testament, sing, and fellowship. Sounds peachy doesn't it? Here goes..... 2. I, personally, have stood back and watched the entire congregation follow the leadership of their pastor, Rick Moran ~ which seems perfectly normal in comparison with other churches nation-wide. However, no one ever questions the judgment of this man, who spent years in prison, convicted of armed robbery, and who has illegally owned guns in the recent past, nor do they stop to consider if what he is teaching them every week is right, or whether it really is screwy that he lives in Bellingham, WA, when his congregation is located in Spokane, thus he is not nearby to monitor the progress, or decline, of his 'flock' 24/7. No, instead he flies over every weekend to teach his congregation the ways of "Y'shua Hamashiach" and leaves wife (Gina Moran) and 6 kids at home with another man, unmarried, in the same house. Is that not considered wrong in the Christian religion? Please correct me if it is. 3. Aside from Mr. Moran (who does not have a pastor's license, as far as I have found out, yet still goes by the title of 'Pastor'), the main object of their devotion is the Torah, which was given by G-d to the Jews. Whether they are all legally Jews or not ('not' is the right one in this case), they consider themselves 'grafted in', thus required to keep the 613 commandments that Jews are required to keep. If one of the members of the Congregation of the Firstborn is caught breaking one of the commandments, they are punished as the pastor sees fit. Whether this means forced lack of communication between the Sinner and his/her family/friends, or ex-communication from the church, it is carried out by the pastor and his side-kicks. Not only do they follow the Jewish people's Holy Book, but they combine it with the New Testament, and have added their "Messianic Prophecies" to the whole pile. 4. What their leader says is law, obviously. Such as, younger, unmarried members of opposite sex are not allowed to be within 4 feet of each-other, and cannot be out of the sight of one of the elder members of the church. Also, when a friend or family member of one of the church member's sins, they bring it before the WHOLE CHURCH, and get the whole congregation involved, then 'give it up to G-d' and do whatever the pastor says.  This is just a warning, so that you and/or your children will not be subject to the fierce control of this cult, which has already been reported to the ADL for harassing a Jew. I will be watching their web site daily and will report anything that falls under the lines of anti-semitism, cult practices, corporal punishment, or harassment of anyone, member or not.  Caring always,  Spyro

      You know, for once....I can't think of much to write. Okay, I take that back. I can think of TONS to write, it's just that it's all so damn predictable: Bush sucks, I hate my sister, the world isn't fair, Adam deserves to be damned, I love my cello, etc. AAARRRGGHHH!!!!!!!!!! How is it that when I live to be mostly unpredictable, I end up being predictable down to the last question mark??? It's extremely lame, so here comes another list.  Joy's list of predictable people.  10. Adam S. 9.  Jessica S. 8.  Abby R. 7.  Samuel C. 6.  Juliane A. 5.  Jordan Y. 4.  Amanda S. 3.  Ashley M. 2.  Sam S. 1.  G. W. Bush  Now, mind you, being predictable is not a bad thing. In fact, it's almost comforting to me that I know exactly what someone will do/say next. Such as........ "Oh look, we've just lost 25 more men in Iraq. What are you going to do about it Mr. President?" Ahh.....he'll always screw it all up. Oh well.  Vote for John Kerry ~ Bush can go play with that big fish-monster thing that just un-earthed itself. Whoa....I can hear a new post......one titled "Big Killer-Death fish/butterfly/seamonkey/penguin/teddy-bear/Loch-Ness Monster has lunch w/the president......or has lunch ~ the president. Heh.  So what do YOU think that thing is?                                           Spyro

       Okay, who else is thinking the title line about this whole 'election might be postponed' deal?? This is ridiculous!! And people actually BELIEVE that there might be a 'terrorist' attack in time to postpone the election? How f*ck*n obvious does it get? G.W. Bush KNOWS that almost no one will vote for him ~ only the hard-core pro-life Christians/Republicans (pretty much the same word, if you ask me). So, he'll stop at nothing to make sure that he's in office as long as he can possibly be ~ no matter what it takes. What whale slime. He's hired some stupid foob, or a number of stupid foobs, to threaten (or lie that we're being threatened) America right at the perfect time. Then, if he can get that crummy Home-Land Security thing to work, all the foobs have to do is light a firecracker off right outside the White House, and TA-DA!!! The election will be postponed to who knows WHEN, and he'll be king forever. OMG, I'm going to Canadia ~ who's coming with me? What can we do to stop this? Heck if I know---come up with something. And be sure to tell the BLASTlizard all about it. Heh.  I'M SICK OF ANTI-SEMITISM  Spyro

      Yeah, so I am the daughter of a hippie, and it shows ~ right? So I was thinking (after reading someone else's posts) that so many people can only talk about what they hate. What they're mad about. What pisses them off. Me included  . Anyway, to counteract all the crappy hate, here are 20 things that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE.  20. Lizards. 19. Anyone against Bush. 18. The stars at night ~ crap, where's the damn telescope?? 17. Mint Chocolate Chip/Orange Sherbet ice-cream. Together. Beat that. 16. My pond, and all the fish in it. 15. Math ~ believe it or not Mr. Woods. 14. Horses. 13. Water. Anything to do with lots of water. 12. Olives. 11. The raids Sam (lil' bro') and I pull off together. 10. All of my friends. 9. My two precious brothers, Sam and Micah. 8. Ja, my parents. 7. That tight-ass piece of music my cello teacher just gave me. 6. The drums. 5. Any recording by Lynn Harrell. Especially the one of Bloch's 'Prayer'. 4. Finding a challenging piece of music and kicking it's ass in a day. 3. My blog. 2. Judaism, which makes so much sense. And, of course, 1. My cello!!!!! And all related to it.  Oh, I forgot to mention Seattle. I LOVE Seattle.  Keep in mind that the order isn't 100% correct, and don't be offended that Jesus isn't on the list.

We might actually make some progress in Iraq (like getting the hell outta there!). 1. He's not Bush.     MAY ALL DUCKS FLY IN PEACE

      Crap, I couldn't find Draco's story anywhere, so I made one up to send to my lil' bro' while he was at camp. Here goes........   Draco, the fierce fiery dragon,  did not have a bright red wagon. So he got mad, (and the next line is sad) singed a fairy named Megan.  Fox news sent out 3 crews to report on the doings of Draco, but soberness they did lose, when they inhaled 3 pints of booze, and instead did a story on Keiko.  So Draco came to the conclusion that bright red wagons are all a delusion. And that he was a fool to think that wagons are cool, when he torch flowers know as Phantasmadusions*  Phantasmadusions he did burn, until of this crime the cops did learn, and their anger grew hotter and hotter..... So they sent out Ursa Minor and Major, and a war those two dippers did wager, as they put out Draco-fires with water.  After a battle of fire/water powers, the dippers saved all the flowers. And Draco flew high, high into the sky, where he now lights the stars at the evening hour.  *a word just for Mr. Samurai

       OK, I'd like to apologize for being a bitch lately, and I want to try and explain why I haven't been my Joyful self so that you may understand the reason behind my bitchliness (oy! A new word!!!). It's really a sad story, and it hasn't ended yet. When I was little, my sister, Jessica, told me (in the midst of some big family feud ~ I don't remember) that no matter what, we would always be sisters.....Oceans apart, and we would always be connected, anything could happen, and we'd always be best friends. That's a promise that I have thought of almost every day since since Jess made it ~ 8 years ago. And we were always the best of friends ~ I was in awe of her---in my mind she was always the smartest, prettiest, most talented person. Then she married Adam and of course (it's what is to be expected), everything changed. But at least she treated me like a sister! As fake as she seemed on the phone... Now, I haven't talked to her in weeks because my brother-in-law has forbidden any communication between her and my family ~ dare you ask why? Several reasons: 1. We're too 'unholy' (here come the religious issues that have split us up) because my parents and 2 brothers are Jewish, none of us believe in Jesus Christ, and we now have the liberty to let loose with our REAL opinions. 2. Adam says that my mother is trying to split up his marriage and destroy his family because she screamed at him on the phone for the many ways he has tried to hurt Micah...Spreading rumors that he's a pothead, etc. ALL OVER THEIR DAMNED CHURCH when it is all thick lies, requesting that my parents retrieve him from his tour of Israel before he could 'sin' (ie. Chill with girls who weren't wearing Amish-style dresses, smoke a Huka, drink a little, etc.) any more, the list goes on... 3. He wants to 'protect' Jess from her own family.  Sooooooooooo.........My thoughts on Adam are this: he's potentially abusive, a control freak, and has severe anger problems. I believe (and this is NOT what my parents have told me ~ it is what I think---my OWN opinion) that my sister is not safe with him, neither is my 9-month-old niece Haddassah, that she is setting herself up for a life of serious HARDSHIP, and that I wish I could go back in time 8 years and prevent her ever meeting Adam ~ I wish she would NEVER have married him, even if that would have meant no Haddassah ~ just as long as my favorite (my only) sister is safe, and 100% out of harm's way.  Jessica, I sent you the link to this web page...Though I know you won't get it, being as I'm probably blocked ~ do you know what that feels like? I doubt you could even make it this far into the site, as you don't believe a word I say because your husband doesn't support it---in other words, you don't trust me. I miss you, and I just want you to be happy and safe.    I'll have you know that yesterday, to Mom's face, I swore to G-d that I would never treat her the way you have for as long as I live. And under Jewish law (which, unfortunetly, I am not under....YET), I must keep that oath for rest of my life.....until I die.     Basically, I'm angry because you hurt my brother and my mom. I want to think of you as a sister, but it's really really hard, because you pretty much ditched your family, and I'm not sure if you care ~ but if you ever need to come back, the door will be open.   And Jess please.......Don't promise me anything ever again.

I've been too busy chilling w/my brother-in-law. 4. Janet Reno. 3. My pony-mule died again and now I hate the music. 2. My mom wouldn't let me practice. 1. Too busy with school.  And my all-time favorite: "I didn't drink a full cup of coffee this morning".  Time to go botch everything I've worked on for the past 2 weeks. *sigh* OFTLOD!!!!!!!!

      the following is from my newsletter BLAST.     how screwy is America?  By Spyro Who of us has actually read Patriot Act II? And who of us knows what the FISA is? Who cares? In honor of our freedom here in this sad excuse for a country, I studied Patriot Act II and have written it AS IT REALLY IS in hopes that you are horrified and feel sick at the ridiculous rules the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act gets away with. This country is on it’s way to being communist ~ it’s no wonder the Russians feel right at home here. See it as it is: WE are the terror we claim to be hiding from. So much for freedom…….but I guess we really lost that ages ago. Like when the first of the Bush-family was born. I’d like to thank the RatVille web site for the links and info. on Patriot Act II. PATRIOT ACT II TITLE 1: ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY AUTHORITIES. SUBTITLE A: FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT AMENDMENTS. SECTION 101 Anyone who so much as looks like a terrorist can now be legally haunted and stalked till their death by the FISA. SECTION 102 If a person is engaged in suspicious activities, he/she could qualify as an "agent of a foreign power" regardless of whether those activities are federal crimes. SECTION 103 Originally, electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of pen registers could only be carried out for a period of 15 days following a congressional declaration of war. Now, with the passing of Patriot Act II, the FISA can carry out all of these things on anyone, whenever congress authorizes the use of military force, or after the US has suffered an attack creating a national emergency. Basically whenever they feel like it. SECTION 104 Now the FISA can listen to and watch anyone they believe to be a "foreign power" without limitations. SECTION 105 Federal investigators, prosecutors, and whoever, can now use ANY information, crime files, and the like for "law enforcement purposes" WITHOUT the authorization of the Attorney General. SECTION 106 FISA agents who are ordered by the FISA court authorities, the President, or the Attorney General, can now engage in unauthorized surveillance or searches and disclose information without authorization. LEGALLY. SECTION 107 FISA pen registers can now be used freely in investigations of both US persons and non-US persons "to obtain foreign intelligence information". SECTION 108 This one amends the FISA to permit the FISA court of review, in it’s discretion, to appoint a lawyer, with appropriate security credentials, to defend the judgment of the FISA court, when the US appeals a ruling to the FISA court of review. SECTION 109 The foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court now has the same authority as the US district court to enforce it’s orders, including the authority to impose contempt sanctions in case of disobedience. SECTION 110 Technical correction related to the USA PATRIOT ACT. Once again, they are changing something in the original Patriot Act to protect the now unlimited use of the pen register, the trap and trace device, and all else that aids in the in the FISA’s plans for soon-to-be communist America. SECTION 111 Anything or anyone who is not a "United States person" can legally be labeled a terrorist or linked with a terrorist organization (a.k.a. Foreign Power). This section also allows extended periods (up to a YEAR!) of surveillance on anyone the FISA wishes.  Check out ‘How Screwy Is America?" next week for: THE PATRIOT ACT II, SUBTITLE B: ENHANCEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS. In other Screwy America news, there are rumors that the Pentagon may reinstate the draft in the spring of 2005. Why else would they be calling for draft-organization volunteers? Bah ~ thanx Bush.  --- BLAST

       Why are people racist? Why do they hate me for what I am, or almost am? Why do people never think before doing/saying something? Why is everyone so close-minded? Do you ever stop to consider what the OTHER person is going through? Or does it only matter what you think, what you believe, what you do, etc.? Did it ever occur to you that there are other HUMANS with actual FEELINGS? Why do people hate other people just to hate them? Is it something that is passed down from generation to generation, and the young just never question whether what they have been taught is right or wrong? Everything seems unfair ~ why do we bother living at all? I live to live, because that's why I was born. I don't know what comes after, nor do I care...Because it's useless dreaming about an 'afterlife' when I should be spending time making my REAL life, and the lives of others around me, BETTER. Hell had better have cellos, being as I've been condemned to the 'eternal fire' for what I think ~ which isn't at all fair, because who is really right in this world? How do you know that your opinion is right? So I'm going to Hell ~ who's coming with me?  I guess I'm just pissed out of my mind, I've been listening to WAY to much Limp Bizkit, I hate my brother-in-law (for good reason), and I'm really stressed about EVERYTHING. I hate being like this, because I don't trust myself. Like, why the hell did I just write what I did? Nobody cares ~ that's what journals are for (I despise them), because no one cares about some else's deepest thoughts ~ which is understandable, as I don't care either.  Go paintball your ass. I haven't laughed enough ~ make me laugh, ass-hole!  Spyro ~ on her way to drink more coffee (haven't had a full cup ~ must be my problem).

      Okay, for those who visited Gina's site (ProudDemocrat-Gina.blogspot.com), you were re-directed over here to read about what horrible hideous things would happen if Bush were to win the election (oh, the horror!).  10. I would start crying. 9. Several thousand soldiers would die in Iraq, with next to nothing accomplished. 8. Iraq would train up it's army, decide they hate us (oh wait, like that's news...) and attack America. 7. We would witness the start of the 3rd World war. 6. Our economy would sink even farther into the depths of....The depths of.....Yeah that ~ whatever. 5. The penguins would start to die off. 4. 2nd depression would be on it's way. 3. Israel would hate us........badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadBAD for the country!!! 2. There would be less jobs. 1. The symphonies would suffer (oh, the Xtreme horror!!!!!!!!!!!).
