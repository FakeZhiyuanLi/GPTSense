      Today was an O.k. day but really only because it was Friday!  Today at school it was the usual crap. Anyway today started out with science. SCIENCE SUCKS!! oh well we had a sub but the SUB SUCKED!! and to top it all off we had 3 pages of notes and a 3 page booklet of work to do! I finished the first page then got carried away talking to my friends. Second period wasn't any better be cause we had social... oh boy :( and guess what we had the SAME SUB AS SCIENCE FOR SOCIAL!!! WTFOMG!! this day just kept getting better (im being sarcastic!) we had to do 10 questions from the text book and a booklet on Brazil! Third period I had english and english sucked as usual because we're doing poetry:( ugh! I did a haiku. Anyways After english it was lunch time. I forgot my lunch today:( Oh well i had enough money for a chocolate bar:)Then it was time for Band practice UGH! I lied and said that i forgot my instrument cause i really don't like band practice at lunch that much... Then once it was over we had to go right back to our lockers to get our stuff for fourth period! In math we corrected a pop quiz that we had and i got 17.5/28 oh well i hope my mom doesn't see this cause she would be all... "You need to better in school or you won't get to do anything fun all you can do is study or read a book until i see a better mark!" routine! Ugh... Once math was over it was time for gym! Yay finally a period worth going to! I gym we still have our Tennis/Soccer/Football unit. Everyone was playing football except for a few people (like 3 or 4) So that was like 14 on 14! Anyway that is way too many people to play football the way we do! So we had a pretty crappy game! at least it was closer this Time around only 28 to 14 this time! lol! I didn't score any TD's but i got a couple 70 yard kick off returns! Yay! That was pretty much the only good things that we had going that game... Oh well. Then school was over and it was time FOR THE WEEKEND!!! The highlight of my day no dought! We started going and we saw an ambulance on the way home! and there was this crowd of people around this guy that was just lying there on the ground! Anyways I got home started up the computer then started typing this blog!  Anyways that was my day i'll blog tomorrow and tell ya what went on in a day of the life of Adam B.  And for thoughs about to rock i salute you!

      Time to start my blog WOOHOO:) Okay... well i went to school today and first period we had Social and social is a whole load of crap! It has got to be one of the most boring class' IN THE FRIGGEN WORLD!! Anyway we did nothing really in social and that is why it is the MOST BORING CLASS IN THE FRIGGEN WORLD!! Then we had second period which was FLA (french language arts) as you can now tell i go to a french school. Anyway in FLA we got a new question de la semain argh i hate them in fact i loath them!! Anyway I didn't work on my question de la semain cause i had to finish my debat (debat means argument in french) with Alex. Then third period i had English now english isn't a bad class but only casue you can speak english in it! But it just so happens that we're doing poetry and poetry sucks! and we got a new assignment in poetry which is due tomorrow!! ARGH! But then  it was time for lunch yay^^! Anyway lunch is my favorite time of day because i get to spend time with my girlfriend Jocelyn!! We started going out May 10th and that was the same day that i got dumped by a different girl because of an incedent with Jocelyn! Oh well she was a WHORE! so i don't give a crap! But anyway Jocelyn and I are real close and One of my friends Cara is going out with Evan P. Another one of my friends. Anyway now some kids from 8-CA or 8-CB (i dunno which one) have a bet on which couple (Jocelyn and I or Cara and Evan P.) are going to make-out first! Lots of people have there money on Jocelyn and I because we are a lot closer than Cara and Evan P.! Anyway... After lunch i had Phys. Ed and we have a Tennis/Ultimate Frisbe/Football unit now. I played football I was on a team with Jove, Curtis, Joel M., Stephen, Mitchell, Nolan, and Myself. Up against Cee Jay, Evan M., Alex, William, Deyvis, and Matthew. Anyway are team sucked BALLS! because Curtis kept throwing to Jove and Jove kept throwing it to Curtis. And they picked of the ball 3 TIMES doing that and scored 2 TOUCHDOWNS! OMG! so anyway Curtis finally throw the ball to me and I caught it and ran for the touchdown! Evan M. was in my way but that didn't matter because he's a small little dude and i just ran straight into him knocking him over (we were playing tackle football not 2 touch)! An i got the touchdown yay^^! anyways we lost 42 - 14 and the other team was on offence only 3 times!!! That just goes to show how many f***ing intercptions our QB's threw! Anyway after Phys. Ed I had band and I think that band is one of the most boring things in the world! It's only fun whenever u get to go on a band camp trip or to a festival or something out of school!  Anyways that was my day i'll blog tomorrow and tell ya what went on in a day of the life of Adam B.  And for thoughs about to rock i salute you!

      Well i got an e-mail back from Jocelyn and she told me about what went on and now i know that all she really wanted was a really good friend. So I understand now and I am starting to feel a bit better knowing what actually happened.  Today is my Dido's (Dee doh, is grandpa in Ukrainian) Birthday (he's turning 84), and I'm making him a card and im getting ready to go at the same time. I hope the party will be fun.  The Flames have a game this evening and I plan on watching it at my Dido's house. I sure hope the flames win this game to put them back on top of the series with a 2-1 game lead! Last game the flames lost 4-1 so the series got tied up at 1 so today we're gonna win and get that lead!!   Music Lost Prophets - Last Train Home

      Today sucked a lot mostly cause i got dumped:( Jocelyn dumped me cause she didn't want a serious relationship, she thought that you cannot build a relationship on guilt or lying, and she liked other guys. so she gave me this note...  "I think we should just be friends" "Sorry" "-Jocelyn"  then i wrote "Why?"  and she wrote: "1.)I personally think that you cannot build a relationship on guilt or lying and both of those were the foundations for ours. 2.)I like other guys and it isn't fair for you. 3.)I don't need or want a serious relationship."  Ya that's about it i felt so empty for the rest of the school day and i really hope that you read this Jocelyn cause I thought we had something, I love you, WHY?!?!

      HOLY SHIT I HAD 2 UNIT TEST TODAY IN MATH AND SCIENCE!!!! Now thats one overload of info i would really like to try to avoid in the future!! And the thing that sucks the most is that the test were both right after the long weekend:( Oh well I don't think i did so good on my science test but I definetly did better on my math test:)  Well Calgary gave Tampa Bay a ROYAL WHOOPING!!! last night they schooled Tampa Bay 4-1 and took a 1-0 series lead in the stanley cup final!!  I think i'm gonna draw a pic depicting the Lightning getting BURNED!! OH YA!  Not much else happened today but I'll keep you updated better from now on unless my comp. goes on the fritz and the internet doesn't work but that I'll just play by ear... (My comp. has been known to fuck up)  Keep on rocking in the free world!!

      Well I haven't blogged in a while cause there wasn't anything good going on or in that case anything at all, it's just been boring.  Well the Lightning won against the Flyers 2-1 so that means we're facing the Lightning in the Stanley Cups Final!! (By we I mean the Flames) We are gonna beat the jockstraps off those lightning players CAUSE WE ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!  The long weekend was fun cause I went to Camp Bar-V-nok (It's a Ukrainian Camp for Youth.) It was a lot of fun cause we played a lot of Ultimate Frisbee, I did some soccer juggling with some of the guys, we had camp fires at night, we ate smores, slept in cabins (I was there for a grand total of 2 nights), we stayed up late, and we played some fun games!! The first day we got there at 7:30pm about so we really only had a camp fire and stuff like that. The second day we all had to get up at 8:00am and we did some church talk and stuff then we played Ultimate! It was fun cause I was got 2 TD's and a couple of good smack downs! Then we had more church talk and Sang ongs and Talked more. I played baskekball with my friends, and when we soccer juggled i got 20 bounces of my legs i one go!! Thats my new record!! Yay. There was this bike there and it was a really really really really really really really really crappy bike! With its completly flat tires no brakes and it being a real crappy color of green! But it was the "ghost bike" cause we would ride it real fast then jump off the back of the bike! The bike would keep going and if you were lucky it would keep going for about 4 to 12 seconds BY IT'S SELF!!! Then I rode it of a 2 foot drop and cause it had no shocks what-so-ever and this is a very small bike it hurt a lot then people started laughing at me and saying i was stupid:( Then my friend went and we laughed at him instead:) The weekend was lots of fun and I'm going back there this summer:)!!!  Keep on Rocking in the Free Word!!
