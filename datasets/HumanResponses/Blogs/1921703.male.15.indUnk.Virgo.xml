       The cannon &nbsp;  Well today my brother Ryan informed me that Vaught Hemingway stadium/Hollingsworth Field has recently brought back "Miss Mary," the Ole Miss Army ROTC Rebel Battalion Cannon, and will be shot off every home game.  For all of you that have never been to a game when they used to have the cannon... it was freakin loud, and it was like the coolest thing ever, and they brought it back to the new section of the stadium.

       When You Come Back To Me Again &nbsp;  There's a ship out, on the ocean  At the mercy of the sea  It's been tossed about, lost and broken  Wandering aimlessly  And God somehow you know that ship is me   'Cause there's a lighthouse, in the harbor  Shining faithfully  Pouring its light out, across the water  For this sinking soul to see  That someone out there still believes in me   On a prayer, in a song  I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on  Raining down, against the wind  I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end  When you come back to me again   There's a moment we all come to  In our own time and our own space  Where all that we've done, we can undo  If our heart's in the right place   On a prayer, in a song  I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on  Raining down, against the wind  I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end  When you come back to me again  And again I see my yesterday's in front of me  Unfolding like a mystery  You're changing all that is and used to be   On a prayer, in a song  I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on  Raining down, against the wind  I'm reaching out 'til we reach the circle's end  When you come back to me again   This is such an awesome song, and it has soo much meaning.. Im probably wrong about what it means but im gonna try and explain what its about.  Basically I think that the first verse means that someone has been caught up in everything in their life and that they dont know where they are goin and what they will end up doing. The second verse, they found their true love and kinda guided them back to life and put them in order.  The chorus is kinda hard to explain but I think its sayin that when he hears her voice hes reminded of her love that rains down on him, and that they kinda went in opposite directions at one time and when they meet she will love him again. The fourth verse says that everything weve done wrong we can change and make right again... All in All Garth Brooks has some of the best songs to look for some kind of meaning, and alll of his songs relate to just about everything in my life.  So if you havent heard this song or any of his songs, then download it now!

       Fortune Cookies &nbsp;  You know what makes me kinda mad... how bogus fortune cookies are, I mean seriously i got this one that said " you will inherit a fortune. " well come on I doubt a bazillion dollars is just gonna fall out of the sky and hit me in the head.  Who types these things anyway?  Is it some mythical Chinese person that thinks they are magical and can make you happy by giving you a random fortune that doesnt come true, and what about those loto numbers on the back.  If you actually go back to the restaurant where you got it to see if you wanna a Chinese jack pot.. then, you need a life, sorry   ( thanks steph for the random fortune cookie idea, it was great )

        Love &nbsp;  You know what I think is awesome, is how much God loves us... seriously we can go completely against him and sin and we would still accept us.  If God can love me that much enough to die on a cross for my sins than I think that is pretty amazing, and it makes me wonder if I can love like that weither it be a friend or a girlfriend/wife.  In 1 Corinthians 13: 4 -7 it says "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."  So if I were to find the right person for me I bet that I would love her with all of my heart and soul, and I think everyone has struggles with loving their friends that much.. but in the end you probably could.

        First Priority &nbsp;  Yes!, Im almost completely done with the appearance of the blog... but until im finally done heres a blog of today. Well today I got up real early to go to school for First Priority, I dont see why people think its too early to have worship.  Espacially when they go to FCA which is only 20 minutes after FP and FP lasts longer, I mean once we get to heaven we wont have to be worried about how early it is when we worship because we wont have time, and we will be worshiping FOREVER.  Anyway, so we start off with a game to kinda get us woke up, and it works so then we go to worship.. which I always think is incrediable and puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day.  So if you go to my school, I kinda challenege you to go and see whats it like, trust me you wont be let done...unless your chair brakes and you hurt your butt.  See ya later

        People &nbsp;  I've found out from the last few years of my life that people are all lovers of themselves, lovers of pleasure, boastful, and unholy.  I think its sicking how people can just waltz around thinkin that they are the perfect christians or think that they are really followers of God, especially when they go and cuss, drink, lie, cheat, smoke, and all sorts of things that makes us lovers of sin rather then lovers of God.  In 1 John it says " The man who says, 'I know him,' but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  But if anyone obeys his word, Gods love is truely made complete in him."  Thats just kinda what Ive been thinkin about today.

       100 mph but still standing... &nbsp;  Once again I was reading Tylers blog and I agreed with something that he had to say.  He said...   "I have been bitten by some kind of ministry bug. I have this extreme passion to be in a church leadership position.  I also have a passion to be in the ministry in some way. I have a passion for helping people, for helping people to grow in Christ and to be in a leadership role. I want so badly for God to just use me in a Huge way, but I feel like I don't know enough, I feel as if what He is wanting me to do...I'm not ready for, and I feel like I'm being a let down to Him. I want to be able to say that I am working towards some sort of goal or walking the path that God has been clearing for me, but sometimes I feel as if I'm taking my own path, like I've lost my way"  and here is where I come in.  I feel the exact same way he does in that, I want to be in the church ministry so bad, and I have a passion in helping people, and helping people come to know Christ.  I too also want for God to use me for some things but I know I dont know enough yet to be used, but here is where me and Tyler are different.  I want Christ to use me in something huge, but then when I look around at all the people around me, Im not just talkin about all my friends, but just all the people in my school; it just disgusts me to see what kind of people that are influencing me now that Im in high school and its just weird to see my friends to be people that I would have never expected them to be.  I guess what Im trying to say is.. its hard for me to try to grow spiritualy and have a better relationship with Christ so that I know what he wants me to do with my life when all the people around are going in all sorts of directions with their life.

       Satans defeat &nbsp;  Dont you just hate it when you do something wrong or you sin and then Satan takes that and rubs it in your face?  I know I do.  but instead when he laughs at us and we have no comeback to tell him other then "your mom", why dont we just be like "well Satan your makin fun of me for not being perfect, but what about your defeat?"......The great dragon was hurled down–that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.  Revelation 12:9.  So next time when the Devil torments you, just remind him that hes already been defeated.

       The Series &nbsp;  Alright the Cubs are ahead of the NLCS 3-1 and so Dusty Baker decides to put in Zambroni to start out are game today, and the last time Zambroni started we lost.. thats one major sign.  By the end of the game its 4-0 Marlins and Dusty still never changes the pitcher, what is up with that??  Now the cubs are still ahead but its 3-2 in the series right now, and we only have to win one more game to go to the world series and our next game is on Tuesday, so hopefully he will be smart and start someone like Prior or Wood to just end the NLCS and give the cubs their victory.  Alright see ya later.

       The ole gang... &nbsp;  I was reading TT's blog and I was thinking about what he said...  "you can forget the relationships you used to have and not only forget them, but seemingly stop caring for them...God doesn't put amazing friends in your life for you to move on and forget. I'm not talking about a group of 30 peole, I'm talking about a handfull of friends that you promised to never stop being friends with"  and all I have to say is that, I'm only a freshman at Ravenwood and I know that God has blessed me with some awesome friends.  Whether I have realized it or not, but if you dont take the time to find out who your real friends are and take the time to really get to know them then, you wont ever have any good relationships.  Last year at Woodland I thought I had a firm relationship with a friend, but at the same time I wasnt really a good christian and some bad things happned and now her family doesnt allow her to talk to me anymore and she doesnt want anything to do with me, but I think I finally realized one day that God was good enough to bless me with a good friend and use her to bring me to be a better christian... So all Im sayin is be sure you know who your true friends are and be sure that you have a firm relationship with Christ so that you can truley be happy with them.

Oh yeah and also the Ole Miss Rebels beat florida for the second year in a row, except this year the score was 20-17, but hey Eli has a better record agaisnt them then that traitor Payton.

       Faith Like a Child &nbsp;  Dear God, surround me as I speak, The bridges that I walk across are weak Frustrations fill the void that I can't solely bear Dear God, don't let me fall apart, You've held me close to you I have turned away and searched for answers I can't understand  They say that I can move the mountains And send them falling to the sea They say that I can walk on water If I would follow and believe With faith like a child  Sometimes, when I feel miles away And my eyes can't see your face I wonder if I've grown to lose the recklessness I walked in light of you  {Little girl:} "I've got joy like a fountain!" "Be kind one to others" "In Jesus Christ Your son"  They say that love can heal the broken They say that hope can make you see They say that faith can find a Savior If you would follow and believe With faith like a child.   This song says so much in just a few sentences.  If we would just have an imagination 'like a child' then we can do so much, but its just that we have grown up from a child and we know what things can and cant be real, but if you still have a faith like a child will you believe in Christ. I have a strong faith in something right now... come home Dana, your in our prayers.

       The People Remedy &nbsp;  Im getting sick of all the people in high school.  All the people who I thought were my best friends, who I thought were never gonna do anything stupid, are all of a sudden turning on me and doing the unexpected.  I'm still friends with some of them and all, but its just not the same knowing that I can't fully trust all of them like I used to be able to in middle school.  All I want is to be able to walk around in my school and walk up to my friends and know that I can trust them with anything they do and be able to talk to them if I need someone to talk to, and I do have some friends like that like Read, Katy, Stephanie, Lauren, Clint, Hunter, Mich, Alex, Allie, and Chelsea.  Now that I look at that, thats alot of people that I'm really getting to know better, not only in person, but spiritualy.. and I just thank God to know that I do have friends like them.  I'm still not sayin that I dont like all the other people that I hang out with, its just that I just dont feel as comfortable as I do around my true friends.......alright I'm just kinda rammbling on here, im gonna shut up.

       Juvenile Hunt &nbsp;  Well today my pops and I decided that we were too tired to travel an hour to our hunting lease.. so we just decided that I would go hunt behind our house.  So we rode up there on the 4 wheeler around 2:50pm.  I got up in my stand around 3pm, and my dad goes back to our house and leaves me in the woods.  So I had been sittin' in the stand for about an hour and a half and all I had heard and seen were squirels until all of a sudden out of nowhere I hear a bunch of noise and rustling in the woods off to my left, so when I look to my surprise and see a big doe and a little fawn, I decided to wait and see if a buck came out becasue I couldnt shoot the doe becasue the fawn was too little to be left alone.  So I wait a few seconds and I hear leaves crunching, and when I look over beyond a fallin tree all I can see is antlers just bobbing up and down, so I put my gun up completely forgeting about the doe and her baby and wait for the buck to come out in the open, and as soon as it did I made the sound of a bleat that a doe would make, and when I did the buck stop, and I fired...15 minutes later I get out of the stand and down to where the deer was, it ended up to be a really nice 7 point with probably a 200+lb. body.  When my pops finnaly got to me with the 4 wheeler it took us about an hour to get it out of the woods becasue it was such a massive body.. but we ended up gettin it to our deer processor, and we will soon be getting the deer mounted for the wall in my room... its gonna be nice.

       The Devil Is Still In Business &nbsp;  As you may or may not know, I have been reading the book  Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire , and it has been an awesome book.  I was reading it today, and something that came across me just really stood out... Here's what it said    "About half an hour into the meeting, after we had been worshiping for a while, I said, "There's a girl here who's been brought by some members, and they'd like her to be prayed for; she's hooked on drugs."    These members began walking toward the front with a short Hispanic girl.  She seemed in a daze---the effect of drugs, I assumed.  Her name was Diana.    I was standing, as I usually do on Tuesday nights, on the ground level with the people, at the head of the center aisle.  All of a sudden, I began to tense up; alarm bells seemed to be going off in my spirit signifying that something was wrong---something was about to happen.  I noticed off to my right a visiting evangelist I knew.  I said to her, "Amy, it's good to see you here tonight.  Would you come help me pray for this young lady?"  AS she moved out of her seat, the Holy Spirit came upon her, and she sensed the same anticipation.  We were suddenly both on "red alert" for some unknown reason.  One of the associate pastors joined us, and we laid hands on Diana and began to pray.  "O Jesus, help us,"  I said quietly.  Like a shot, the mention of Jesus' name brought an explosion of rage and screaming.  The five-foot-one-inch girl lunged for my throat, throwing back the two friends who had guided her up the aisle.  Before I knew what was happening, I had been body-slammed against the front edge of the platform.  Diana ripped the collar right off my white shirt as if it were a piece of tissue.  A hideous voice from deep inside her began to scream,  "You'll never have her!  She's ours!  Get away from her!"  The language then turned obscene.  Some of the congregation stood and began to pray aloud.  Others gasped.  Some covered their eyes.  Meanwhile, several deacons jumped up and tried to pull her off of me.  Despite her size, she fought all of us with tremendous strength.  We finally managed to subdue her.  Amy, the evangelist, began to pray fervently.  I leaned over the girl to address the spirits:  "Shut up!  In the name of Jesus Christ, come out of her!"  I demanded.  Diana's eyes rolled back in her head, and twoce she spit directly into my face, no more than a foot away.  The church kept earnestly calling out to God for his help.  Clearly, we were not battling some imaginary "spirit of anger" or whatever.  This was a classic case of demon possession.  Within a few minutes, the girl was set totally free.  She stopped cursing; her body relaxed.  We relaxed our grip on her, and she gently stood up to raise her hands and begin to praising the Lord.  Soon she was singing, with the rest of us, "Oh, the blood of Jesus!  It washes white as snow," as tears streamed down her cheeks, ruining her makeup.  Diana has been serving the Lord for ten years now in the Brooklyn Tabernacle.  Recently she married a young man, and both of them gave strong testimonies of their faith in front of mostly unbelieving relatives.  She is a wonderful Christian today who loves the Lord and wants to serve him  alone ."  Basically all I have to say about that is that... Look what the power of God can do with an ordinary person.

       Welcome to Laodicea &nbsp;  I was looking back on some old notes I took from when Jay, my youth minister, was preaching one Wednesday night about the church of Laodicea, and I just wanted to comment about something he had to say.  He was talking about how God didn't like the fact that the people weren't either hot or cold but lukewarm, and here's what I have to say.  Imagine yourself at Madison Square Garden sitting in the front row watching your favorite basketball team.  About 8 minutes or so into the game, your losing 28-7.  "We're committing foolish turnovers, we're not rebounding aggressively, we're giving up fast breaks."  The coach calls a time out and we huddle, one person comments on how cool it is that they are playing in Madison Square Garden, another comments on how good the jerseys look, a third waves to his family, and a fourth runs over to give his girlfriend a kiss on the cheek.  What do you think that coach would say?  "Hey! Would you guys look at the scoreboard?  We're getting killed!  This game is going to get away from us if you don't wake up!"  As a team we couldn't fantasize or make believe we were doing well.  The scoreboard was the signal that we had to change our game plan.  The Christian world is not playing as well as we think.  We often confuse faith with fantasy.  Hebrews 11:6 states that "without faith, it is impossible to please God."        So I say to you now.  We are deeply in trouble, it is a high time that we wake up and look at the scoreboard!  With some exceptions we are like the church at Laodicea.  We have so institutionalized Laodicenism that we think its normal to be lukewarm (Rev. 3:15-17).  We have profesed our faith to God and accepted him, but we are so overwhelmed by our everyday life that we don't realize that we are drawing away from Christ.  So I urge you, wake up, take charge, and come back to Christ.

       Calling on God &nbsp;  I've always thought that Satan's main strategy with God's people has been to whisper, "Don't call, don't ask, don't depend on God to do great things.  You'll get along fine if you just depend on your own cleverness and energy."  The truth of the matter is that the devil is not terribly frightened of our human efforts and credentials.  But he knows his kingdom will be damaged when we lift up our hearts to God.  Listen to David's confident assertion in Psalms 4:3.  "Know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord  will hear when I call to him ."  That was David's whole posture, his instinct, and especially his approach to warfare.   it doesn't matter what the Philistine armies have.  If we call out to God, he will give us the victory.  If we backslide and don't call, then we can be defeated by a tiny army.   David is basically saying, "You can chase me, you can persecute me, you can do anything you want... but when I call on God, you're in trouble! The Lord will hear you when I call to him."

       Stereotypes &nbsp;  How come everyone sees me as the "model" or the "actor"?  I mean why can't I just be normal and seen for me and not what I look like or what I do?  Why can't I been seen as Kyle Torti, and not Tyler my older brother, yes I realize we look alike... but were brothers, and I can't help that.  I may act like him, but thats because I look up to him more then anyone, but Im my own person... not someone else.  I don't live his life, I live mine.  Yeah the jokes can be funny sometimes, but Im sick of not being able to be recongnized for my own life.  Everyones a stereotype... "oh look here comes tyler, oh wait I mean kyle." and "nice model pose."  Why can't I just be reconginzed for me.  There are still some mixed feelings about somethings but my spiritual life is starting to take off on me.  Im currently reading this book called "Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire" by Jim Cymbala and even though Ive read 80 or so pages its really had an affect on me and its made me realize that I need to pray alot more then I have.  I kinda know where I stand with my friends... but its kinda lopsided right now, schools alright, and still very confused about my love life.  Although I had fun tonight... some parts were kinda rough for me, but Im not going to get into any of that becasue its all staying with me.

       Finally fixed &nbsp;  Yeah so we actually finally got our computer fixed, and I know this because we got a new computer because all of the circuits on the mother board or something where fried somehow... but anyway enough with boring computer stuff.  I've been kinda feeling weird lately, not like sick or anything, but just having mixed feelings about everything.  Things like school, friends, my spiritual life, my love life, and its just that I dont know which direction Im headed in any of those things... like I want to go one way, but cant becasue I know somethings cant happen.  Also for some reason I having something, a thought of some sort, some great idea for something that I havent yet figured out kinda lingering in my head... and I dont know really how to explain it at the moment, but its crazy becasue I can feel my life changing before me and im not sure yet if its a good or bad change.  Well I think Im kinda drifting off here, so Im going to go do my homework now.

      I think its sad how the world is coming to where mere christians cant even forgive eachother for things that they have done, and even though God has forgiven them... we are so caught up in our foolishness to realize that we should forgive our brothers.

       What's it about? &nbsp;  So sick of this life, sick of this misery.  I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going, not even sure why I'm here.  Just wanting to know my center rather than be lost out there in a confusion of hate and despair.  (sorry for rhyming, that just randomly came to me)

       Thoughts and Struggles &nbsp;  For some odd reason a lot of my friends asked me why I haven't been "blogging" and I guess I couldn't really give them an answer.  They said I should write down what I was thinking, but there are just so many things going on that I don't even know where to begin.  Like for one, my spiritual life I feel is slipping away ever so slowly... and I've been trying really hard to keep it up but theres just no fire or spark in my life right now.  I know that I also want to be in some sort of ministry, but I think thats kinda hard to do when you don't have a close enough relationship with God.  Also this may sound a little weird coming from a 15 year old guy, but I'm really ready to have a wife that I can love, and have someone to always be with, and to start a family with kids of my own.  Anyway I just wish that I could find a center to my life rather than just wondering around hopeing that something good will happen.

         Like Lighthouses I was recently listening to a Garth Brooks song, and even though I've heard the song many times, the lyrics have never really caught my attention... until now.  In the song it says, "There's a ship out, on the ocean at the mercy of the sea, it's been tossed about, lost and broken, wandering aimlessly."  When you think about what that says, what you get is that... we are all like lighthouses, in that, the beam of light is significant to us searching  for truth, and the ocean is the world around us, but the storm that stirs up the ocean is like Satan, because he will do whatever it takes for us to not find God.  But out there in the ocean a boat lurks, and that small boat out there amongst all the haste is God.  Everyday Satan complicates our lives more and more, making the waves larger, and as much as we reject God or don't devote ourselves to him, than the more we hurt him.  For some people, they don't see God out there in the stirred up world because of the giant waves Satan has created.  But still for some, God is like a large vessel that's about to hit the island.            It goes on to say in the song "There's a moment we all come to  in our own time and our own space, where all that we've done, we can undo, if our heart's in the right place."  What I think that means is that, no matter how much sin we have, if we realize that God is there for us to forgive us then we can make everything better....  Like lighthouses, we are ever searching.

         You'll Think of Me I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and all your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday

         Ravenwood Remedy Well Im here to complain about something, because that seems to be what Im good at... but anyway its about Ravenwood.  Basically when you hit high school all your friends become aliens and you have no idea what happened to them.  Like people you thought were your bestfriend will eventually dump you for someone else or just completely screw you over somehow or someway.  Also I think its pretty stupid how a lot of people there "profess" to be a christian and go to FCA or FP and then that weekend you hear or see them out drinking and doing all this other stuff.  Another thing is, whats up with the staff at ravenwood?  Although some teachers are pretty cool... were not aloud to do like anything that pertains to having fun, its almost like a jail.  Back to the people thing... how come people mostly date now only to get something?  Why can't people just be with people they actually like rather then what they want?  "O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon you."  Dear God, help us out a little here, Satan has really worked his way into school and into our daily lives and all thats going on really is like a vast army attacking us that we dont know what to do... and we are worthless without out you, just be with us and deliver us from evil.  Amen

         Not my God Well, I was listening to another song and I was thinking about what it really meant (since that seems like that's the one thing I'm good at.)  But anyway, I was listening to "Your Not My god" by Keith Urban and this really stuck out to me because it's a lot like out everyday lives.  It starts off saying "It's just a piece of paper, it says 'In God We Trust.'  A little sure felt good, but a lot was not enough...I thought I had everything, when I held the gold."  Sometimes we let so many things control our lives, things like money, being popular, winning things, or looking good, whatever it is, they always end up taking the place of our God.  It's pretty obvious in the song that he's trying to say this because he goes onto say, "'Cause you're not my god, and you're not my friend.  You're not the one that I will walk with in the end.  You're not the truth, you're a temporary shot, you ruin people's lives and you don't give a second thought."  This is why I love this song; it speaks so much truth in just a few short lines.  I'm not going to recite everything from this song, just because there is so much and that would take a while, so listen to the song and think about what it means, and think about what material things in your life that replace the one and only God.  If you realize these things and correct them I guarantee you will get closer and closer to God.

         Camp 04' WOO!!, BOO?? Well overall camp double head was awesome once again, but at the same time I was kind of disappointed about my attitude towards it all.  I was put with some of my really good friends from church in a cabin, and basically as soon as we found out that we were all together we turned into people we weren't (I still can't talk normal from it... literally).  But it was just fun to be able to hangout with my good friends and be who we wanted to be.  I think since I was with them it weakened my focus on why I was really there.  There were times where I was really worshiping and I learned a few things from Greg Pinkner, and there were times where I was distracted by the things around me.  But theres just something missing, something that I'm still lacking... and I think its the fact that I just learned things and never really drew closer to God.

         My life story  You put me here for a reason You have a mission for me You knew my name and You called it Long before I learned to breathe  Sometimes I feel disappointed By the way I spend my time How can I further Your kingdom When I'm so wrapped up in mine  In a Blink of an eye that is when I'll be closer to You than I've ever been Time will fly, but until then I'll embrace every moment I'm given There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye

         Cover Me  Cover me, cover up my tears  Cover up this man who's covered up in fear  I need a peace of mind, I need a piece of you  TO cover all that's gone and everything that's new  You unveil me with your mercy  I want to breathe you in  You unfold me, then you hold me   Cover up my heart, cover up my soul  Cover up this world and everything I know  You cover up the sky, you cover up the sea  Cover up the mountains and every part of me  Everything single breath I breathe...cover me   I am still alive and covered up in years  Covered up in lines as innocence appears  So give me a peace of mind, give me a piece of you  To cover all that's old with everything that's new  You unveil me with your mercy  I want to breathe you in  And you unfold me, then you hold me  You unveil me with your mercy  I want to breathe you in  You unfold me then you hold me  I want to shed this skin  You unveil me with your mercy  You unfold me, then you hold me  You unbreak me, would you take me home  Lord, I don't know what to do right now... this life has me so confused about where I need to be with you, I wish I could just cover everything up so that I can focus on you and what plans you have for me so that I can use them wherever I go.

         Chicago or Bust I'm not sure how many people actually know I have a website...I'm not even sure how many people read this, but I don't care.  If I think of something to write, then I'm going to write it.  This is kinda my way of writing out my thoughts I guess you can say.  Rather than writing them down in a little journal, I write them out on this.  I used to be good at random deep thoughts... only now I can't ever think of anything to say.  But I guess I will talk about our upcoming trip to Chicago.  Im really glad Im going, and the same time.. Im not sure that Im ready to go.  Chicago is such a God absent place, where not many people have heard the name of God, and I just hope that I will know enough to be able to share that with people, and not preach something wrong to someone.  Or if someone questions me about why I believe what I believe, I just hope that I can answer that.  over the next 2 months before we go, were going to have training so we will know what its going to be like when we get out there, and before then I hope that I will realize that I'm going to need to be closer to God than I have ever been before.. and after the Chicago trip I hope that I will have faith that can move mountains.

         R.I.P. Cottontail       I felt bad today at work... Me and my co-worker Tyler Knox where weedeating my boss' back yard and we came apon a nest of small cottontails, a few scattered... but one stopped and stayed still.&nbsp; So Tyler and&nbsp; I went up to the little furry thing and started to pet it as it sat in shock.&nbsp; I told Tyler to watch it as I went to go get some gloves so I could pick it up and hold it, but when I came back it had run away... so I commenced in chasing it, and when I did it decided to run a different way as I bent over to grab it.... and I accidentally stepped on it, and consequently I felt bad afterwards.

         Love is patient... I'm not Have you ever liked someone but were too afraid to tell him or her because you didn't know what their initial response would be?  Well I've been in this situation for a long time, and I don't think I will ever tell them... I've told them once but I knew what they were going to say, which I wasn't going to like, but oh well.  I don't even think I would ever have a chance to be in a loving/Godly relationship with them even though I think we have alot in common spritualy and in general.  I was at the mall yesterday with my brother Tyler, and we were just hanging out because he left for Texas today and will be gone for a month... but anyway we were walking around and I was kind of thinking to myself "when will I experience love, and will I know it, what should I do to find the right person" and right as I was thinking this, this guy came up to Tyler and I and gave us a card, when I turned it over I noticed the verse 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 was written out, and the thing that caught my attention was the first 3 words..."Love is patient".  So in other words I think God is telling me to calm down and let it happen.
