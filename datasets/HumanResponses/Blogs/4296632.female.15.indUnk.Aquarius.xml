       alana convinced me to make one of these things!! hope it works out well lol      i lived through the first week back to school! lol wasnt that bad.... AP BIO rocks...ummm only cuz we have a "swimming" side of the room - Amy, Beth, Jose and I! :-). and YIPPEEE Joseph Paylor is back...yes my "first kiss" everyone and i do have a class with him haha - i feel so bad for him - all he got from everyone on the first day was "have u seen emmaline", "did you kiss her at that dance", "do u remember what happened at the dance"... cuz i know i got sick of it! lol      so ya my parents are nazis....but then again, whats new? They dont let me go to the Jesuit football game today cuz they think im going to meet someone that that i dont want them knowing about? then i ask to go to kelseys and they bring up the whole incident from LAST FALL!!!!!!! ahhh will they ever forget?? i think by now ive learned my lesson.... so they say i cant cuz i tried to decieve them earlier today. they finally let me go to Sliders and then the minute i get in the car when he picked me up, my dad goes off on me "why were u guys outside and why were you at the side of the building (monica refered to it as "loitering" hahah).... who is that? ... what were you doing? ... did u stay here the whole time... are you telling me the truth?... i dont believe you... blah blah blah". Then the whole thing w/ the grades....so last semester i had some trouble in English. I got a 73 on my report card (really not bad at all considering...). So i get my cell phone taken away. I dont have it all last six weeks, the whole summer, and all of this six weeks again till i get "good grades". Oh and i cant watch tv, use the computer, or talk on the phone during the week. i cant stand this anymore! lol thats it alana....we're disguising ourselves, taking ur dads truck, and going to Vegas!!! and first ill need a *reduction* lol, contacts, short hair, and platform shoes! haha      on top of that.... some *un-named person* is being an asshole... hmmmmm how to explain w/out giving it away...he completely ignores me and is a jerk to me all the time that about sums it up! another *un-named person* is ALSO driving me crazy....Monica and i have a theory... you're nice to him, he falls in love with you, you tell him you dont like him, he thinks he can change ur mind and make you like him and while doing it hes a complete ass and "violent verbally" (lol Monica) ... ahh boys. Cant live with them, cant live without them      heres another complaint....ALL THE GRADUATED SENIORS ARE LEAVING NOW!!!! but hopefully ill get to see my gorgeous twin tomorrow! :-)      im going to sleep....gotta get up early tomorrow! lol alana and i are gonna go for a "walk" and have fun with Frost signs... hehehehehehehehe      **and it chills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill** ^^ gotta love Big and Rich - save a horse ride a cowboy - or as erin would say "save a horse, listen to punk"
