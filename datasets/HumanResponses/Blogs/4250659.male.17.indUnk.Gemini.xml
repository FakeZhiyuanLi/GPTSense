      Comments have been removed due to a certain   KICKER   leaving shit on them. How you like them apples Joe. Anyway, football kicked my ass today. Ankles have replaced shoelaces for the #4 spot on the most annoying things on earth. I think they might even give flight attendants a run for their money in the #3 slot. I'm just flat out exhausted. We have 15 more hours of football in the next 3 days, so by Saturday my bed is gonna look extremely friendly. Hopefully not just for me, but maybe a couple ladies as well. Just kiddin neow. That's not my style. The online test I took said I was more of a "Romancer", but then again it told me that my Hawaiian Island was Maui. F that jive, I'm Kauai. I do get to move to my bro's room, though, since he is departing to grand ol' Pullman on Friday. It's bigger and more private, so my drums probably won't take up half the room like they do now. I have so much junk in my room its going to be a 4 day process to sort through what I want and don't want. I'm a packrat what can I say. I still have Ninja Turtles. Partly as tribute to the greatest television show ever, and partly because they are still fun to play with. Feel free to come help me clean, maybe I'll let you sort through the stuff I don't want anymore. It'll be like my own Goodwill store. Rock on.

      I'm working on some rants, stay tuned for them. I have to get my creativity back on line first. Summer kind of unhooked it, or maybe it was the margaritas....

      I have always thought that fate was non-existent. I mean, seriously, what all powerful entity could possibly map out events in people's lives? I've never had much luck with some things,such as with girls. It seems that things start to go your way, but then out of the blue something happens and everything caves in, kind of like my good friend Curry's chest. But don't worry Drew, any lady with an average IQ thinks that drinking water, or dare I say alcohol, off a chest is hot. Well that's what I hear, or maybe I just think that... Anyway, back to the fate spiel. So, I use to think fate was a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but after a recent event which I won't go into detail on, I'm starting to think that fate is real. Maybe those past "relationships" failed for a reason. Maybe this new thing might actually work out. And if it does I'm going to make a movie out of it. You'd know why if you knew the story. All I can do is sit back and wait, and see how everything pans out. To sum up, It's more of me hoping that fate is real so this whole shindig works out. Call it wishful thinking, call it whatever you wan't. I don't care. I'm sticking to this, damn it. And if that all powerful entity does exist, I'd like to switch places with him, and see how  he  likes it to be fucked with.

      The U.S. basketball team suffered an embarrassing loss the other day. To Puerto Rico. An commonwealth of the United States with only 4 million people. It wasn't even a hard fought battle for the Peurto Ricans, who easily cruised to a 19 point victory over "the greatest players on earth". Why? It's because the NBA is full of sissy over-paid thugs. They don't play hard. The NBA players basically let the Puerto Ricans tie their gonads in knots. The Peurto Ricans ran down on offense and scored before the NBA players could say "7 figure salary". Ever since the Jordan, Bird, and Magic era ended, the NBA has gone to shit. Will any of this change the style of play in the NBA? Probably not. But will the NBA lose respect? It's as certain as divorce within a year for Britney Spears.
