      Sunday, May 30, 2004  No restaurant this time, we are our own cooks and Marty and Rebecca hosted.  Attendees: Rebecca Marty Tracy Laura  Matt  Jaime Karen  Andreas  Menu  Drinks: Manhattan Masala Cosmo's by Jaime  Appetizer: Filo Samosa's by Karen  Dinner: Chutneys by Marty Indian Potato Salad by Tracy Saag Paneer by Rebecca Aloo Gobi by Laura Lamb Byrani by Rebecca Madras Curry by Matt Naan by Laura  Dessert: Oranges in Grand Marnier by Marty Garam Masala Cookies by Tracy Basil Mint Ice Cream by Tracy Argentinian Candy Compliments of Jaime  Ok, I'll start off the recap of this night, but I'm making mistakes in names of dishes and omitting things I'm sure - so everyone should join in and add to the recap.  First of all, we can cook!  The food was tremendous in taste, appearance and amount.    The drinks were killer!  They were light and divine, but unfortunately packed a mean punch.  Not that we needed help getting the party started, but they sure did blast us off into orbit.  After a late start we finally sat down to the beautifully decorated table to enjoy our feast.  Afterwards, we all felt a bit stuffed.  So we braved the rather late hour and the sweltering humid heat and went out for a walk in the hopes of working down some of the food.  We managed about 3-4 blocks and then turned back towards the house.  Alas, we lacked the will or proper attire to hike the 26 miles that would have been required to work off 1/4 of our dinner.  We returned to recline and visit for a while longer then said our goodnights.  I for one must admit to waking the next day with a vile hangover and major headache.  Pictures to be emailed shortly.

      Naan   Yields 14 servings. Prep Time:	30 Minutes Cook Time:	7 Minutes Ready In:	3 Hours Avg.   1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 1 cup warm water 1/4 cup white sugar 3 tablespoons milk 1 egg, beaten 2 teaspoons salt 4 1/2 cups bread flour 2 teaspoons minced garlic (optional) 1/4 cup butter, melted  	    1	In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise.  Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume.  2	Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball.  Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.  3	During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.  4	At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.  Aloo Gobi  *	1 large cauliflower - stripped of leaf, washed and broken into bite-sized florets *	2 large onions chopped into coarse chunks *	3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks *	3-4 pod of garlic grated * 1 inch ginger root grated * 1 jalapeno or green chile grated *	Spices: Turmeric (halidi), Garam Masala, Ground Coriander, Salt, Dried methi (fenugreek) *	Seeds: Onion seed, black mustard seeds and Cumin (Jeera) seeds. *	Some splashes of lemon juice *	A large karahi (large pot a bit like a wok) in which to pour 3 or 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil   Heat the oil in the karahi until hot. Add the onion, mustard and cumin seeds and watch them pop and fizzle for around 20 seconds. Then add the coarsely chopped onions and fry until they are translucent.  Then add the garlic, ginger and jalapeno and stir fry until they are infused in the oil. Then add the powdered spices: 3 teaspons of garam masala, 2 teaspoons of ground coriander, 2 teaspoons of turmeric (haldi), 2 teaspoons fenugreek and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir it all up until well mixed up.  Add lemon juice.  Then add the chunks of potato - stir until well coated in spices and then put the lid on the pot and let it simmer on a very low flame for around 15 mins. This will soften the potato a little. Then add the cauliflower florets and stir until fully coated and yellow looking. Again: put the lid back on and let heat on low simmer for around 20 minutes more.  After that - stir gently but thoroughly and turn flame off - (if available sprinkle on a generous handful of fresh coriander leaf). Then put lid back on for around 10 minutes to rest. It’s then ready to serve

      Thursday, May 13, 2004 – 7pm   Vietnam Restaurant 605 West 19th Street Houston, TX 832-618-1668    Attendees:  Rebecca Marty Laura  Jaime Matt Karen Tracy   Price Per Person $15   This restaurant got major snaps from us – mainly because they let us bring our own wine! Everyone braved the rains and gathered for a simply wonderful evening.  We ordered a couple of plates of Imperial Rolls (4.95), also known as Vietnamese Egg Rolls. While they didn’t serve them with cilantro and mint as I’m used to, I did think the stuffing was great and they were fried perfectly. We also got Spring Rolls (4.95), which I am not an aficionado of, but thought them wonderful. Mainly because they didn’t have the normal rank piece of pork or chicken, but instead used tofu. I chose the grilled eggplant ($6.95), which while not significantly seasoned or memorable, was light and refreshing. My favorite was Tracy’s Vietnamese steak or beef ($8.95), which was tender with a very flavorful sauce. Karen’s Peppery Fish ($8.95) was served in a hot pot and was delightfully seasoned and fresh. Several people loved Matt’s Black Pepper Scallops (10.95). Rebecca got the Lemon Grass Grilled Chicken ($8.95) and Jaime got a pork dish – was it the Pepper Pork Simmered in Fish Sauce (6.95)? And I can’t recall what Mary got.  While some of the dishes were well done, I thought the price and amount was appropriate.  The staff was busy, but strove to keep in line with our fun mood.  I love that this place is so close to my home!  For more info go to: http://www.thevietnamrestaurant.com

      Sunday, May 2, 2004 -  12pm  Canton Seafood Restaurant 2649 Richmond, Houston, TX 713-526-1688  Attendees: Marty  Rebecca Laura  Cost Per Person: $30  Ok, I messed up and waited too long to reschedule.  When I couldn’t reach Marty & Rebecca, I headed out to the restaurant.  I arrived around 11:45 to find the place closed with no sign of life.  Workers began arriving with grocery bags and looking at the drab strip shopping center exterior, I didn't have much hope.  Marty and Rebecca soon arrived and we had our pick of tables.  The menu seemed uninspired, typical Chinese cuisine and not what I was led to expect.  The waiter came over and we asked him to tell us what was really good.  On his advice we ordered Australian prawns($30.99/lb) for an appetizer.  The tails were served as sashimi.  They rolled the heads in a spicy salt and deep fried them.  Tiny seafood forks allowed you to eat the delicious insides of the prawn's heads.  The dish was amazing!  Fresh, sweet and beautiful.  Our main course was a Dungeness crab($26.99) cooked to perfection in a golden curry sauce.  There were bits of caramelized ginger in the sauce.  We loved it!  We were up to our elbows in curry, cracking and sucking the legs and shells.  (Get your minds out the gutter people!)  Our vegetable dish was Sautéed Romaine Lettuce with Special Spicy Sauce(5.95).  We got it for the novelty, but fell in love with the flavor.    While sad no one else could make the event, we managed to muddle through by stuffing our disappointment with one exquisite meal.  Sorry you missed it!  For more on the restaurant go to: http://www.cantonseafood.com

      Sunday, April 4, 2004 – 11:00am  Ocean’s Palace 11215 Bellaire Blvd, Houston, TX 281-988-8898  Attendees: Laura  Celeste, guest from Atlanta Marty  Rebecca  Matt  Jaime  Karen   Cost Per Person: $13  It all began with an out of town visitor and a trip across town for Dim Sum.  We beat the crowds and got a table in the back near the drink tables.  We tried numerous dishes, including the white pickled chicken feet.  (No, I wasn’t brave enough to try them.)  Our adventure was so fun and delicious we decided we’d try and get together regularly to try new restaurants and cuisines.

      Well, I can't believe we were so damn good.  I mean if we can cook Indian like that imagine what those old grandmas from Mumbai can do !!!  In any case, I had a great night and luckily for me the next morning was no problem.  I feel better knowing that we can party like those people I see in Food & Wine magazine ... beautiful place, delicious food, fabulous drinks, and spectacular company.  Here is the very easy recipe for the Vodka drinks:  1 twist of lemon peel 1/3 cup cranberry-raspberry juice 1/4 cup blood orange vodka (ie. Charbay) ... I used Grey Goose though. 2 tablespoons triple sec  Rub the rim of a chilled martini glass with the lemon twist and drop it into the glass. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.  Add the juice, vodka, triple sec, and shake.  Strain into the glass and serve.
