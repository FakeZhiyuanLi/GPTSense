       ok i got beef. This may come across as a little weird here but about to take the big 40cm step right onto my own personal soapbox in support of the Dixie Chicks. Well in support of them in as far as recent events connected to them have illistrated a wider problem with which I got major beef. Lead dixie chich singer with bad perm makes one crack at a London gig, saying she's not being thrilled about being from the same state as the man about to launch an ILLEGAL war on Iraq and sales of Dixie Chicks albums fall faster than Michael Jackson's offspring off the 13th floor balcony. Followed closely by death threats against them and their families, huge articles from editors of the lapdog media condemning them and a nation-wide radio blackout. What the fuck is up with that!!!??? Now I'm not a huge Dixie chicks fan but their last album sold 5 bazillion copies so don't tell me that 200 million people woke up overnight and realised their music was crap.   I can't stand the fact that Americans are willing to risk nuclear destruction, cold war, vietnam, bosnia and two world wars defending democracy and liberty when they are so keen to give up those exact same liberties themselves, inparticular i refer to free speech. Free speech - the right to disagree with your own governent and not be locked up. The right to protest openly about things you don't approve of or think are right. The right to free, open-minded, critically-minded media that will call the events of the day as they see it and not pander to any political agenda. The U.S government is doing a pretty handy job of reducing civil liberties in the form of terrorist-related constitutional reform. But by jingo's the american public is doing a much better job of taking away their own liberties with small-minded, red-necked and wide-spread social conciousness that says it is unpatriotic to criticise the government, a conciousness fed by both the media and the government. Boo mIchael moore at the oscars, don't watch martin sheen's tv show (even West Wing is the best thing on US TV), stone the dixie chicks, close your eyes and ears. I can't stand this behaviour in what SHOULD be an intelligent democracy. I hate it even more when the carry out wars trying to spread a doctrine that they themselves can't live by. Especially when the motives of the current government have been made as transparent as a cher ensemble. The average american is shitting me to tears because they are being lied to like the rest of us but they don't wanna know. End o' Beef  Just saw 24hr Party People and is was just so good. A really funny/tragic/cool movie, esp seen with an intelligent audience that knew why it was all so funny, or tragic, or important. vale ian curtis...

      Well, Guy you're possibly missing out one of the wackiest Perth weeks (in other words we're actually getting wasted for a reason). That's right Retro Ball is tonight, I'm currently sitting here with my hair in rollers and a fag hangin outta my mouth. Yes I'm going as the stereotype 50s waitress (jade green straitcut double breasted dress with white collar and trim) I just wanna say the line 'oh double doodoo, one of my diamonds just fell in the macaroni!!' In other news, Erin is actually working in the field she was trained for! That's right, I'm designing, wierd huh? well right now I'm a pleb assistant designer but I do have a show later in the year, how did this happen? When I did absolutely nothing to promote myself? ... and especially in Perth.... Ok so II just purchased the coveted Who 25 most Beautiful People Issue... nad I'm having issues....to make this brief I'll break it down:  Those who deserve to be in it:  Naomi Watts: hot, natural, freshfaced, fun, everything a celebrity actress should be, before you ask, I don't know what I'm basing that on;  Owen Wilson: hot, extremely amusing, interesting looking;  Orlando Bloom: rediculously hot; Jana Wendt: better with age like a fine wine, and lives in cool house in Mt Lawley near uni Jake Gyllenhaal: we all know my feeling on this matter I won't bore you with over the top lusting Michelle Jank: hot, and yet another awesome designer from Perth Julianne Moore: ref. Guy's description of the Oscars, and even better wearing my favouite McQueen dress of all time Daniel Johns: ok, I'm admitting he's hot now that Silverchair have finally proved themselves with Diorama Queen Latifah: bout time that diva got recognised Rose Byrne: as above  (although replace 'diva' with another term)   Those who CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT be in it:   Adrien Brody: ok he's a great actor, seems like and ok guy but ... no Norah Jones: aaagggggggggaggggghhh so frustrating  Delta Goodrem: fuck off you annoying shit head Antonia Kidman: annoying and constantly pregnant, nobdy wants to see your hideous stomach Bono: no. Rebecca Cartwright: just sop trying Mark Webber: since when a Formula One Drivers hot in any way? Peter O'Brien: blah Ivan Sen: ew. although Beneath Clouds was a great movie. Dr. Harry Cooper: What the? I know I'd like to pin him down tie him up and lick him and shit   The 'nothing' people:   Carrie-Anne Moss, Chris Martin, Claudia Karvan, Kate Hudson, Olivia Newton-John

      And I forgot to mention what is currently most amazing of all: Tatu,  They're Not Gonna Get Us . Could this song be any more perfect? A cold Russian winter, eurotrash synth, and teenage same-sex infatuation. Brilliant.  I hope I'm not missing out on anything fun and wacky in Perth...

      Ohmygod the Androids piss me off. First of all, I've seen the lead singer guy at the airport, and he looks like he's pushing 35. Thus you have the total airbrushing of all the band members in all their videos. The fact that they're old enough to be our dads means that they should NOT be dressed up like 15 year olds discovering Dangerfield. Secondly, their music sucks, but that is self-explanatory. Don't they understand that they are a gimmick band? We only cared about the drag queens, not the music! Amusingly they're trying to make it in the States, which I hope they do, cause then they can move to LA and be wankers over there.  P.S. How awesome is the clip to Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield": She uses the "shimmy" as a weapon!  And Andrew, Laurie is  nobody's  hootchie mama...

      Actually saw the Androids live on saturday night and they failed to impress me as anything other than a musically tight, novelty pop-rock band. Lead singer Tim Henwood spent much of the night "wowing" the audience and boring his band mates with extended masturbatory guitar solo's and uninspired crowd banter. Yet another middle-tier act that appears unready for a bigger international stage... Where is Laurie D? At least Guy has the excuse of being distracted by having to write small thesis' for "symposisistssts"  on a regular basis. Where is my hoochie mama??

      Few things I�ve noticed recently: Lisa Marie Presley: �Lights Out� although made to look/sound like everyone else, just looks like such a fuckin bitch still, and that�s why I love her. Craig David feat. Sting �Rise and Fall�: what the? Are they really having a coffee convo thru song? Sugababes �Shapes�: Once again the babes bust out another awesome clip, and once again I paid no attention to the actual song. The Androids = snot: pick it, lick it, roll it, flick it. Can�t wait for them to go away. Rosanna Arquette = weird hands Nicki Webster = awkward hands    Song of the Day:  anything by downsyde   Quote of the Day:  'Everything is post these days, as if we're all just a footnote to something earlier that was real enough to have a name of its own' --- Margret Atwood   Word of the Day:    juvenilia:  n.pl.  author's or artist's youthful works   Pickup line of the Day:  If you were a booger, I'd pick you first  my apologies if this posted twice

      Well, I must say Emanuel is 'so cheezy I can't watch him without crackers', but Furze, I think you might've topped him! And don't worry I have on tape!!! aha hahahaha Well, update... hmmm. yes well after getting back from the pub at around 2am I got up for work at 5am, still drunk. And what is my first fucking task for the day? That's right, getting up on a ladder to change the fuel prices, that certainly didn't go down too well. This whole work thing is doin my head in already. Luckily Brendan saw how much pain I was in and let me go home at 7.  Man.... last night was possibly the greatest Scotsman I have ever experienced, I know thats a big call  but I really would have to agree with myself on that point.  In other news, painting number two  (Nick Enright) is well underway, I have a feeling its gonna be quite brilliant if I do say so myself, Exhibition date: May 26th, shit I better get a wriggle on!   Song of the Day:   Evolution Revolution Love  - Tricky feat. Ed Kowalczyk , forgot it existed till I borrowed the album off the diva the other day. Fuckin great CD.   Quote of the Day:   "I was like, 'I want that one!'" [on boyfriend Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees ]-- Jessica Simpson    Word of the Day:    infra dig:    predig. adj. colloq.  beneath one's dignity   Gravestone of the Day:   Against you I will fling myself,  unvanquished and unyielding, O Death! Virginia Woolf  (Monk's House, Rodmell, Sussex, England)   Pickup line of the Day:  Walk up to a girl who is standing and say, "You look tired, let me clear you off a place to sit" then wipe your face.

       Yes, yes... Rove was pretty cool. Met good old Kasey Chambers (and her beautiful kid). The backstage rider was plentiful so if the band looked slightly inebriated it was because we were tipsy...and miming. Actually I had to sing live so I didn't over indulge until afterwards, where I may or may not have told Peter Hallier that he should work on his routine... Also I met Olivia Newton John which just about beats out hanging with Tim Rogers at Pepsi Live last week. While we are on the subject..just how unfunny is Corinne Grant? I'd love to get paid to sport my lack of comedy talent on national television every week. I just read that last sentence and realised that is exactly what I've been doing with emmanuel for the last month...hoo boy...time to move on me thinks...Still he has paid for extensive repairs on the 'rago love bus and got me a free trip to the home of hedonism, Buntine's place.    Delta Goodrem rocks and I will one day marry her. Sophie Monk is as vacuous in the flesh as she appears on television and possibly even more so. Dylan Lewis doesn't put on that hammy persona...he REALLY is like that...scary...   OK I've gratuitously name-dropped enough for oune blog...i'm out   peace, love and mungbeans  Andrew

      Well, considering the 'blog world is cut throat'(!) I'm alarmed at the constant impatience with my blogging, despite the fact that I have an extensive 'of the day' section, I never promised to be blogging every frigging day! despite popular belief, I do actually have a life! Anyway, a new factor in this 'life' is that I'm now a working girl with income/ beauty school drop out. Yeah, back to working at the servo, its great. I think I might wanna do it for the rest of my life, and especially this servo, in the heart of industrial Perth. As Noni said today 'Is there anything you cant handle?' 'Yeah, only the amount of HOT FUCKIN GUYS  THAT COME IN!' I seriously feel like I'm in an old school diet coke commercial every five seconds. Big dirty hands.... ruffled dirty hair .... baggy dirty overalls .... so dirty ... too dirty to clean my act up.. And then! my boss also runs a modelling agency so there's all these hot chicks walkin as well ... to much to handle.  I'd like to send props to my mumma for promptly making and sending me a batman tshirt! fantastico!   Song of the Day:   Blaze of Glory'  Bon Jovi. God I wish I was a cowboy. 'I don't know where I'm goin, only god knows where I've been, I got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed'.    Quote of the Day:  I'm trying to make an effort not to mention drinking on the blog much anymore but what noni said on Saturday night was sensational: Shayne: 'Erin, should you really be driving?' Erin: 'Noni... say it!' Noni: I feel much safer ... when ... Erin is drive drunking'   Word of the Day:     scintilla :    n.  trace [Latin = spark]   Gravestone of the Day:   And alien tears will fill for him Pity's long-broken urn, For his mourners will be outcast men, And outcasts always mourn. Oscar Wilde  (Pere Lachais; Paris, France)   Pickup Line of the Day:  Would you like to dance or should I go fuck myself again?

      Turbo-speed blog: Madonna,  American Life : love it. Tina C's "Twin Towers Tribute": love it - especially her best-selling album,  9/11, 24/7 . Gay nightlife, hate it. Early declaration of success in Iraq, built on totally shaky ground (see  Symposiasts  for details). Queen Latifah: star on the rise (and a lovely lady, as my Mum will vouch for). Russel Crowe wedding: tasteless. Miyah - Guy

      Hmmm... reading over my last post, the events of Wednesday night are not surprising. I would like to personally thank all those who contributed to my drunkeness, as I was pretty outta control and didn't spend a cent, props to you all! Apologies to Panda for calling her a dirty little hoe after the waapa after party, and she knows why. I appear to have discovered the ultimate relationship for my lifestyle, casual sex, but more than the usual casual sex, i.e every second night, which obviously requires some kind of dependance but no reliance. yes. excellent. Better get to work in securing this. If I start to get attached somebody stop me coz it will be all bad. God, I love this oh so public diary. At least I'm exposing what a true wanker I can be, got nothin to hide.  That's right Erin reassure yourself. 'Voices? what does she mean voices? Shut up Jan!'   Song of the Day:    I Still Do  -Cranberries. Inspired by the prospect of seeing the Cranberries/Counting Crows Double Bill in Ireland, Yes the Crans are has-beens and in their last 2 or 3 albums turned into an ultimate pile of shit but I'm still holding onto the near brilliance of the first two, and considering its a 10 year Anniversary show, I'm hoping they'll bust out a few old tunes, plus seeing Counting Crows in Adam's 'favourite place on the planet' is gonna be quite excellent.   Quote of the Day: "Every relationship I've been in, I've overwhelmed the girl. They just can't handle all the love. " . --Justin Timberlake   Word of the Day:    yah   [also  yah boo]   int.   expressing derision or defiance [imitative]   Gravestone of the Day:  Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." Edgar Allan Poe (Westminster Presbyterian Cemetery; Baltimore, Maryland)   Pickup Line of the Day:  The word of the day is "legs." Let's go back to my place and spread the word.   ... thank you and goodnight

      Yes hello, not much to report, I'll probably post later tonight after the pub, when I've seen how drunk I can get with absolutely no money. But I'm gonna do all this stuff now before I'm too drunk to think of them....   Song of the Day:   Lovecats  -(acoustic) The Cure. Aw so cute. 'How could we miss someone as dumb as this?' Haven't listened to the Cure for soooo long, it was a natural progression after making the mistake of listening to Depeche Mode last night, god damn Depeche, has the same effect on me as Cruel Intentions...  my sex drive is outta control (even though I'm completely incapable of having any kind of relationship, fresh diagnosis from Dr. Guy)   Quote of the Day:    "I discovered I scream the same way whether I'm about to be devoured by a Great White or if a piece of seaweed touches my foot." - Axl Rose (Guns'n'Roses)   Word of the Day:     discursive:  adj.  tending to digress, rambling [Latin  curro curs- run]     Gravestone of the Day:  Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime Dean Martin ( Westwood Memorial Cemetery, Los Angeles, California)   Pickup Line of the Day:  (Walk over to her)"Ok, you can stand next to me, as long as you don't talk about it."

      well, I'm not sure whether to be insulted or to simply bask in the glory of my so well described lifestyle. Furze, you did that pretty damn well I must say, although I'm not impressed with my newly established nickname now being spread to the eastside. Can I have some feedback on the new look please? I think it might be a nooooh-gooooh on the taragoooooh, with the jooohjoooohba from octooooohber.... but it is kinda growing on me, all colourful and shit, a bit of a change to my recent relapse into the all-black phase. I'm an artist ok! So, I set out to do the wankiest research project of all time today (speaking of being a faux goth arteeest) yes, I'm researching revolutionary soviet film posters of the 1920s and 30s. This is actually for a painting, I'm not just staring at a 1928 Mikhail Dlugach Poster for 'Cement' and 'mmm'ing in agreement/fake recognition. But I have discovered that they are my new favourite artform ever (the whole American Abstract Expressionists were getting a bit old ... I still love you Rothko).  Meanwhile I've got beef with living on a semi-main road, so many fucking randoms!!! Ok, in the last week we've had people coming in and asking us if we a) are having a party,  b) can give them a ride to a hospital c) have a bandage for their pretty severely cut up wrist and tonight:  "Hey guys how long would it take to walk to Dogswamp from here? Do you guys have a spare beer? I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown ... oh thanks, do you have a cigarette? all i have is this plastic bag of cigarette butts its pretty embarrassing, oh thanks... hey you don't have any red wine do you? Yeah I'm in my 30s now and I've got nothing, my life is completely shit .... blah blah blah"  And we have to sit there and listen to this shit! This is getting outta control! Anywho....   Song of the Day:     Without you I'm nothing  -Placebo   Quote of the Day:    I'm unclean, a libertine, and every time you vent your spleen, I seem to lose the power of speech, you're slipping slowly from my reach, you grow me like the evergreen, you've never seen the lonely me at all'  - from song of the day   Word of the Day:    paterfamilias:    n.  male head of a family or household [Latin = father of the family]   Gravestone of the Day:  Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted. Sylvia Plath Hughes  (Heptonstall Churchyard;Heponstall; Yorkshire, United Kingdom)   Pickup Line of the Day:  My love for you is like diarrhoea. I can't hold it in.

       Ok I've been MIA as well, but I've been on the road with a certain under-acheiving blip-on-the-radar pop act so there's my excuse. And, of course I got sent to Perth and was priveleged enough to be welcomed into Perth's own little debauched-artist community otherwise known as Erin's place. There is something kind of surreal about a spending time with this motley collection of WAPA and ex-WAPA mob. Night follows day in a hazy, intoxicated fog, marked only by the type variety and/or quantity of liquor that is deemed appropriate (ie red wine monday's, blotto @ Pub wednesdays, start drinking before midday fridays etc). Many profound things are said and many regrettable things done, but nothing has any real consequence because all is forgotten by the next afternoon. I learnt so many life lessons in my short time in Perth but I'll attempt to condense it down for the readership of this blog...     1. All the nutrients and sustenance required by living organisms to continue life on this planet are contained within seven glasses of Dry Red    2. Morning is an abject, abstract concept, a modern-day hyper-exestentialist myth that has no bearing on reality as we know it. There is no such thing as morning    3. The best way to maintain a friendship with someone is to sleep with them on at least a casual basis    4. Everyone's life is an exercise in futility due to God attaining perfection with the creation of Adam...Duritz    5. It is possible that scientists anylsing the various forms of fungae growing in the fridge could find cures for various diseases, so for the sake of humanity lets leave them there.     6. Centrelink appreciates the creativity displayed in your dole diary and does not find it the least bit incredulous that your nine applications in the last fornight for positions in major law firms were turned down.    Anyways, needless to say I had a rockin time in Perth and hope to be back there soon. Thanks to da Panda, C*%$ntine, tom and Noni for allowing me to drink their grog, smoke their weed and watchtheir batman videos...   Ciao  Andrew   P.S Guy, what's your take on Emmanuel? I need the self-confessed expert's view...

      Howdy folks.  Ok I'm in a slight dilemma. Regarding my latest phase of being a bar-fly. I�m just not sure what kind of bar-fly I�m looking to be. I�m slowly getting used to the fact  that I wouldn�t be sitting in bar for �picking up� purposes, but purely dedicated to solid drinking. So what does one wear to such an occasion? I�m gonna go for comfort I guess,  but all black of course, might have to throw the beret in there somewhere. But its gotta be fuckin expensive, ordering bar-fly type drinks all day/night, and there ain�t no way I�m gonna be bar-flyin and not drinking a double scotch on the rocks or some shit. I�m tempted to just BYO Scotch in a paper bag, ok, so I guess I may as well be on a park bench. No, I�m committing to the bar, I wanna be holding up my glass and singing �Piano Man� or something. �. man I can't wait to get to America where all my cliche dreams come true...  Hmmm a work in process ...   Song of the Day:   Exit Music (For a Film)  - Radiohead. Just such a fitting title. This song takes me back to hmmm Year 10(?) somewhere around there, walking everywhere, train station, school, sitting on trams with discman on, pretending I was in a movie. Gotta start doing that again pretty soon.   Quote of the Day:   'Since all contemporary action leads to murder, direct or indirect, we cannot act until we know whether, and why, we have the right to kill'  -Albert Camus, 'The Rebel'   Word of the Day:   Radical  C'MON!

      Alright alright! Jees man, people bag  me  for havin no life! I take a week off the blog and people are hurling abuse at me! Even abusive emails from parties who will remain nameless! Ok couple of reasons I haven't been blogging, yes Furze was here for a couple of days but I basically couldn't be bothered, plus in the last couple of days fuckin telstra has put the recorded warning on our phone every time we pick it up, coz we haven't paid the bill. Hence I couldn't connect to the net. Anywho, I've got a new life plan, I'm doing a fuck-load of paintings to eventually exhibit at the end of the year. And now that Hannah has agreed to let me exhibit in her shop on a regular basis, its gonna be wicked.  I'm not happy about the new blog Guy, ok yes I admit I've been lazy in the last couple of days but please don't stray, I need you to pick up on my spelling mistakes (me fail english? thats unpossible!)    Song of the Day:  Basically anything by Electronic, possibly  Breakdown , Its all just so slick, post hacienda jumpy poxy new order styles.   Quote of the Day:  This is a quote from a few days ago, posted by popular demand you might say, its something i said to big red diva the other day, ' Y'know Noni, there's not a lot of places to go in Perth and you certainly haven't been to many of them'   I personally don't understand why this is so funny or needs to be posted but anywho...   Word of the Day: pipsqueak:   (only beacuase its an amusing little word that I haven't heard for a while but I found the dictionary meaning a bit harsh)  n. coloq.   insignificant or contemptible person or thing [imitative]

      alrighty, the obvious lack of contribution to the blog can be explained by a number of reasons -Erin is occupied with furze -Guy doesn't wanna post anymore because he is responsible for the most recent contributions! -I'm posting now -Furze isn't posting because (see reason 1)  I got nuthin

      Righty ho... As much as I'd like to think I've got something worth writing on the blog, I really just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Is it really that difficult?  Am I, too, computer illiterate?  Why didn't I pay attention as I watched Buntine post those early morning blogs o' randomity?  Now I'm just getting myself into a state... I'm not seeing much  'of the day'  action so I'm just gonna throw something out there... feel free to catch but know that I'm moving into serious music theatre territory here (ah ha ha! Am tarnishing the bohemian nature of the blog already).   Noni's Cheesy MT Song of the Day:   "Far From the Home I Love" from the popular musical  Fiddler on the Roof .  As far as decent solos go in that show... its the only one.

      "life is like a nipple" - possibly one of the best quotes i've heard recently and since Buntine is probably indisposed (or mid-air) right now. I'm gonna take the LIberty of announcing Camille's quote to be "Qoute of the Day". Also like to the opportunity on behalf of this burgeoning blogger community to wish Ezla the best for her whirlwind "substances of the world" tour 2003. Hope and pray she comes back in one piece with lots of cool shit for me. Oh and you guys too...

      Shit, I am so computer illiterate. I don't know if I just posted part of the essay I am writting or if I posted what I wanted to post or whether I deleted it all. Fuck! Anyways, I just read the entire blog, the whole lot...do you hear me?...why?...because like Bridgie C was earlier on, I am shitting my time away in the uni computer labs. My brain and my hearing has been numbed by the drone of the computers :(  Ok, ok I'm sorry I didn't mean to dump on you all...come on back to the screen...my other message was much cheerier, before I deleted it. Fucker. I have nothing more to say except this life is like a nipple; sometimes it's hard and sometimes it ain't. You didn't really expect something deep, did you? ;)

      OH MY GOD FURZE!!! When the hell are you going to put me in your suitcase and take me on wild weekends to Major Music Industry Identities pads??? HELLO this may be my profession one day, I could be the next Michael Gudinski....hmmm actually maybe not, I will be the next Sharon Ozborne, (except my husband will not be incoherent)...   and if the Sharon Ozborne thing doesn't happen, I will be the next... Stevie Nicks/Karen O/Kim Gordon/Debbie Harry/Courtney Love, all I need to do is learn how to sing.. this is where you come in Furze, in fact I think you could help my launch my career, lets talk turkey with Gudinski... actually how about Vodika I think he'll be more my type of man... I can shmooz!  Somebody give me a break here.... Somebody make me a rock star......     KATES MOST EXCITING moment of the day - When she found out Blondie were touring in July..... oh        my       GOD!  Kate's (not Erins) Song of the Day - Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's   Album of THE DECADE    - THE NEW DEFTONES IS.....soooooooo fucking goood   Television show to watch tonight  - The Guardien mmmmmm oh lord Simon (wheres the Denny gone?) Baker is so incredibly hotttttt!

      And by the way, there's been a lot of people asking how to write on the blog, I'm picturing a lot of people trying to click at the site, or just randomly starting to type... its easy but not that easy. You need to get a Blogger email invite from yours truly, so if you do wanna get in on the bloggy-goodness just email me, I think I've invited almost everybody that I have the addresses for, so if I haven't invited you I either hate you or don't have your email.   Also, its good to see the team expanding, good ol' blog, bringing the Aussie coasts together, can you feel the love in the room people?   Song of the Day:  'Run to Paradise' by the Choirboys, ah memories of Saturday night... just shows my commitment to cheesy tunes when I can still listen to them when on traditionally 'clubbing' style substances.   Quote of the Day:   Never move into a house  with someone who plays The Smiths all the time. Don't do it. I never liked the Smiths and now I loathe them because its all I ever hear. ... Three in the morning is the time of choice for Smiths fans to play their albums. The suicide hour. Like, 'I've been out, I've been rejected I'm coming home to my damp little flat to play The Smiths and be depressed and kill myself'    -John Birmingham 'He Died With a Felafel In His Hand'  Why do I always chose quotes that make an amusing mockery of my life?

      Ok, just got from two days at the Gudinski mansion in Mnt Macedon. Experienced a couple of relaxing days on a writing trip with the manny-man. Th tranquil and opulent surrounds were certainly inspiring. I was inspired to swim in the indoor pool, watch DVD's on the worlds biggest indoor entertainment system, sample excellent examples of chateaux 84' cabernet savignon... pretty much everything except write songs. Playing with this kid has been a real weird trip and it only promises to get weirder. Rumour: He is currently being touted as for the support slot on the Christine Aqulira tour in October/November. If he gets it i get to tour round the country with the little slut herself. Watch out for the tour diary. Guy- do you wanna come along as roadie and impartial observer?

      Greetings. Hmm its Monday.   Well I don't have much to report except for boring organising to go away details so I'll spare you all. However I have discovered and bloody good mag called ADBUSTERS - Journal of the mental environment. Each issue is like a work of art developed around one theme its fan-fuckin-tastic. I just have to quote from it....   Quote of the Day:    I have a friend, and she has metamorphosed back into larva. All of a sudden she's a punk, buying $60 pants from Hot Topic and listening to blink 182. I just hate it that it doesn't mean anything to her. She idolises one of my ex-friends who has a screwed up life, so she fabricates a life wherein she is depressed, deep, and no one can understand her. What a mystery. What an enigma. I can't deal with it anymore. If I tell her I wish she'd stop being a whore and a druggie she cuts herself. Two weeks ago she and I had an argument about American life and if it is indeed, self-destructive. Guess what side she was on. Is there a correlation? Is love of country hatred of yourself?'   -Gavotte, ADBUSTERS Mar/Apr 03   Thought of the Day:  Melissa George on Friends, ... so much girlier than I remember her to be when she rocked up to Summer Bay 'with the band' (Frente)

      what the fuck..... today we had a sale.  I'm talkin' hundreds of DVD title's new and used.  But now (10.05pm) as i look at what the punters left behind, i am reminded of the woe that can come from working at Blockbuster at the Morley Galleria  These people will spend hundreds of dollars on piles of shit films like Dirty Dancing, XXX, Enough(with that ho J-lo) or Mr (fucking) Deeds. In their wake of bad taste, they leave fantastic films like The Wonderboys, Swingers, Buffalo 66 and (get ready for it) MAGNOLIA.  Now I know that it is unreasonable to expect everyone to like the same films. But surely of the 2000 or so transactions we had today, somebody would have appreciated unmanipulative, thought provoking films that aren't designed to be amusement park rides.    Let the viewer decide...

      Christ! the blog is goin' off.... ah the delight of the blogging freshmen.  Although all you Perthonalities better get your arse into gear, and one liners don't count as contribution Shaynal, I'm yet to hear your Crows criticism. I dunno if the invites come with instructions but its quite simple really, you just type then click 'Post and Publish' basically, but if you consider yourself rather web savvy feel free to show off your html skills to pay da bills.  Well I'm off to 80s night tonight, oh baby oh baby. haven't been for sooooooo long I'm ready for the biggest dance off ever. "I wanna dance!" . In other random news..... I'd like to voice an addition to that old saying "dance like there's nobody watching, sing like there's nobody listening etc...." and that is "Pee like there's nobody in the next cubicle" Y'all know what I'm talkin' about, it bugs me every time.    Quote of the Day:    Real, real like a plastic bouquet. Thrives, on the smoke from an old fire place. Dies, every night with her face on the news. Nobody cries, they just smoke and stare at their shoes. The only difference is Nobody can cry, its hard to do For most folks without a reason why. Cry on demand How did you learn to? Cry on demand Teach me if you want to Y'know you don't have to, I'll just close my eyes And think of you.   - 'Cry on demand' - My favourite Ryan Adams song  Apologies for the new habit of lengthy quotes. I promise it'll stop soon. PS- Gardiner, edging in on my song of the day segment huh? ....... yeah.

      Maybe there is a bogan blogg somewhere with bogans posting things like - "i was standing in line at KMart the other day when I saw a group namby-pamby artistic WAPA-type graduates. Made me sick to see their neo-gothic, remanants-of-alternative-culture clothing, tokenistic piercings and tatoos, aloof "i'm so departed from society" attitude and converse sneakers. I Can't stand how none of them have jobs. At least I cook pizza's and lay concrete for a living. I may wear trackies as a fashion statement but it's closer then they'll ever get top actually exercising. They all smell like bong water and cigarettes and should be abolished". Now that would be a sweet blog...

      Well you've invited me into blogger at the worst possible time, my exams are coming up, and this is the perfect tool for procrastination - knew I could count on you Buntine.  Erin the beauty of the bogan is real. There is no need to abolish this social uinderclass, just consider the places like the galleria, and most public transport, as a social museum. After all, 'the bogan' is an interesting creature, as you have identified, the young bogan may engage in hideous mating rituals where they parade in offensive attire and smoke even more offensive cigarettes, but when they procreate you can be certain that their little bogan children will do the same thing in about five years.... the bogan allows us to laugh and feel good about the fact that we have all the oppurtunities in the world, without ever coming close to infiltrating our nice existance. So let the bogans have their commodores and cheap hair gel, at least they are doing it in the confines of boganville.

They may have all stacked 25kgs on EACH but they know how to rock the shit..... obviously the 6 slabs of LIGHT kilojoul beer on the BDO tour didn't do a damn thing   Man of the Day: Jarred Leto and tall dark rockers with broad sholders and brooding eyes....mmmmm

      Well, I see that Kate and Bridget have joined the Bloggin team, excellent excellent excellent get crackin'.  I'm feeling a little bet depressed and there is a very good reason for this.  I just went to the most almighty bogan shopping center in Australia: The Galleria, Morley, Perth, W.A (all those locations are adding up aren't they?) I was there at 4pm. This means it was in full swing of its regular patrons: 14 year old girls who have come straight from their Morely/Dianella High School gotten changed into their Polyester/Elastane pants which lace up down the side, barely there white tops, badly straightened and producted hair, pale pink eye shadow, badly applied liquid eyeliner and some kind of whitish lipbalm. Then there's the boys: a freaky amount of facial hair for their age, grease, Fila, Kappa, Nike, Fubu, Adidas and a whole lotta attitude. Plus the usual 30 something mums screaming and hitting their children for no apparent reason queing for hours in Kmart and Target.  THESE PLACES ARE HIDEOUS, AND THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABOLISHED.

      Ok, Guy, I don't know whether you're disputing my argument or not, your rockin' sister's quote only reaffirms it. She's exactly right, most people who are 'dating' only do it so that they can lay awake at night thinking 'what do I wear to the date?' 'What should I say if they say this?' 'how should I act? like myself? but that would be me being really conscious of being 'myself'...."WHO AM I?"blah blah blah' its so completely mind numbingly boring. Yes I am bitter, very bitter. But it seems that the 'dating' phenomenon has suddenly resurfaced out of nowhere, or maybe it was always there, and everybody else has gradually eased into this early 20s maturity and I'm still 'clinging to the gutter' as some people would have you believe.   In other news, we didn't get kicked out of our house, thank fuck, it looked dodgy there for a second, but we're here till August so its all good.    Song of the Day:  'Live Forever' - Oasis. So full of tasty rockin' goodness, it never gets old.   Quote of the Day:    You can hide beneath your covers And study your pain, Make crosses for your lovers; Throw roses in the rain, Waste your summer praying in vain For a saviour to rise from these streets. Hey listen I aint no hero, That's understood, All the redemption I can offer girl,  Is beneath this dirty hood, With a chance to make it good somehow, Well what else can we do now? Except roll down the window  And let the wind blow back your hair. This night's busted open These 2 lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real To trade in these wings for some wheels Climb in back, Heaven's waitin down on the track Oh come take my hand, We'll ride out tonight to case the promised land Oh Thunder Road....'  - The Boss (sorry, got a bit carried away, gotta love the boss)

      Erin, I think your dating beef sits on shaky ground. 1. not everyone lives in your free-lovin WAAPA world where a quick pash in the corner functions as a greeting and/or introduction. 2. Everyone knows dating sucks. I was having this discussion with my mid-twenties and thus man-hunting sister the other day. I asked "Why do people date? It's such a hassle...". She replies "Why do you think people date? It gives people a pointless distraction from the mundanity of their miserable lives. You get something to plan, talk about and think about. The fact that it usually fails is really irrelevent". Cheers to world-weary cynicism!

      ok just because I'm in Melbourne doesn't give all bloggers the right to completely slack off!!!!! This thing has to stay alive for the duration of my trip, and I'm gonna spice it up, get a load o' people writin' on this, so in theory there should be somethin' juicy to read everytime ya look.   I've got beef.  I'm disturbed at the amount of 'dating' that is going on in the world today and I'm disturbed at the fact that EVERYBODY has a girlfriend/boyfriend. Pretty soon its gonna be impossible to have my free-lovin fun times with anybody cos everyone is so damn settled and 'happy' that they've achieved their goals in attaining a meaningful realtionship. I for one won't stand for it. I refuse to be in any kind of long term bullshit at the age of 21, when I know that the realtionship won't survive over a maximum of three years, which effectively is three years wasted out of your life when you could have been havin crazy fun lovin times with various people.  So to wrap up, my stance is this: ALL RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE BANNED PRIOR TO THE AGE OF 26  Now as I gradually climb down off my soapbox I'll do the 'of the days' on the way down:   Clip of the Day:  Call me pretty slow, but I only just saw the uncensored version of Robbie's 'Undone' and its fuckin fantastic! Used to hate the song and now I absolutely love it,  everything about that clip and the lyrics is awesome, maybe because I just read his biography 'Somebody, Someday' that Guy gave me, soooo I've been reading about his crazy lifestyle and how he 'got over it', the clip says it all.

      ok yeah hi, um when I said that that was gonna be my last blog for a while, I forgot I was going to Melbs like the next day where, obviously there is a computer so its all good.   Yeah so,  Melbs, think I really like this city now, in fact I might even love it, but only in autumn/winter, its just so artisitc.  date check: exactly two weeks till i leave.......... so excited.........   Album of the Day:  'Don't be affraid of love' - Lo Fidelity Allstars, (crazy brits in Ibiza kinda tunes) picked it up along with Doves and Symposium in a 3 CDs for $1 (!!!!!!!) deal yesterday, biggest bargain of my life.   Song of the Day  'United states of whatever' - Liam Lynch, I completely forgot about it till a few weeks ago, man I love that song, hilarious.   Clip of the Day:   now that I'm back on the Mtv diet I can do this, I'd have to say  JLo's Glad , its just so hideous. In all my experience of watching bad hip hop clip after clip, never in all my years have I seen a clip more devoted to booty. The booty rating is through the roof, so much so that I'm gonna have to watch it on 'making the video'. I'll update later.    Quote of the Day:  How many husbands have I had? You mean apart from my own? - - -Zsa Zsa Gabor

      Ok, well straight off, this might be my last blog for a while coz bec is taking the puter tomorrow, ah man  its like parting with a best friend.  Anyway, I'd like to point out that I might disagree with Guy on a number of things. Ok, I didn't watch the Logies but I must say that Delta sucks dick in every way, I hope you're basing this wholesome, innocent, mini-diva respect on her character on neighbours or something cos I really don't know where you're gettin it from. Plus the new single better be a cover cos I swear it sounds like an 80s epic ballad. And I just listened to American Life on quality headphones and it sounds wicked though slightly repeditive with crap lyrics, but love the actual music. However, I do agree that Sophie Monk is irrelevent in every situation, likewise with Bec Cartwright being atrocious (I think she's been dipping her fingers in J Lo's lobster bake btw). In other news, I've quit my job, yeah it was great while it lasted. I have no regrets.   Quote of the Day:  'Smoking's like sleeping with an ex-girlfriend that I don't really like but I know she's really good in bed' -Shayne  In this tell-all final blog (for a while) I'd also like to declare that:  1. Jewel's 'Pieces of You' album is pretty fuckin good, an excellent choice for shower singing;  2. I do have a strange crush on the Marios that run Swish and Chips;  3. I've decided that I'm at the greatest point of my life so far (result of semi-deep convo with Shayne) 4. I seriously am an alcoholic (ah the irony) 5. I've finally perfected my best of Counting Crows CD 6. I'm going overseas in a few weeks and there is the possibility that I might not come back for some time. I think there might be a lot of things I need to sort out in my head, and I think I need to be alone for quite a long time. So in the next few weeks, I'm spending as much time with all of you as possible whether you like it or not!!!

       Logies Rundown:  Opening song: Bec Cartwright was totally atrocious; like some drunken teenager prancing around doing Karaoke with some hip-thrust moves she'd practiced in her bedroom each night of her teenagedom. Dannii Minogue was comparatively classy, although deceptively tiny. Sophie Monk was irrelevent.  Eddie McGuire : I've said it once, I'll say it again -  finger in too many pies . Micallef gets total respect for managing to be funny in a comedy-free zone. Delta maintains respect, although there were some quite terrifying off-key moments in  Born to Try . If she cut the Mariah-style vocal theatrics, she'd do much better.  I totally dig the fact that she takes her shoes off when she plays the piano. She's real. Everything else was pretty much irrelevent, except for Don Lane's kick-arse and crazy speech. The guy from  The Panel  was about to start bawling. And finally, did people notice the fact that for about half the show, literally half the tables were empty? As Bert Newton himself suggested, at the Logies, half the celebs are in the bathroom either throwing up, or shooting up.

      Ok, well, as I worked today I now have my weekly fix of gossip mags. I'm happy to report that Kimberley Stewart made another appearance in Who, Kimberley may also be spottedon the 'Shrine to Kimberley' (or 'Collage of the ugliest people in the world') on Noni's porch. This time she's embracing the fam, daddy Rod and other hideous siblings.  But what I'd really like to make note of, is the whole Jen and Ben saga which was in every one of the 7 publications I read this morning. To tell the truth, I really can't make any sense of it, it appears the articles are mainly about the prenups and Jen's control freak hatred of Matt Damon. Anyway what's really funny about the whole thing is the amount of made-up quotes for filler; here's my fav from New Idea:  '"Ben saw it as a mountain out of a molehill situation but it became a very big deal." the source (!) says "He was pleading  'Baby, you know I love you' , but nothing seemed to placate her. J Lo blasted him for taking a potshot at her mum Guadalupe' Where the hell do they get these 'sources'?! Anyways, thanks for the suggestions Furzikins, although I don't think the 'suggestion' of Ryan Adams is reeeeeallly necessary, as he will take up most of the Cds anyway, just random songs that I'll try and fit to match the city.

      Yes yes, sorry about the pub call, it was wednesday, I had the pub on my brain, quite excited to come home really, feel like I haven't been there for ages.  Good call on the overseas-haven't-really-planned-anything line. I just realised that the first place I'm going to I know nothing about and couldn't speak German to save my life nor have I planned any accomadation.... hmmm better get on top of that.  Anyone know any good hostels in Frankfurt? no? didn't think so. I'm doomed.  Think I'm having pre-travelling alone anxiety.   Anyway, as I haven't done any of this for such a long time....   Album of the Week:  Interpol 'Turn on the Bright Lights' , excellent excellent excellent album. Props to Griffo for putting me onto them, I need a little nudging to listen to anything new these days, and I've been very pleasantly surprised. This is the kind of band that doesn't really sound like anything I've ever heard before but as soon as I put it on, I get this instant warm familiarity, its awesome.    Song of the Day:    NYC  by Interpol, I'm putting together a Compilation of songs for each city I'm going to , if anyone has any suggestions for the following cities let me know stat: Berlin, Prague, London, Dublin, New York and L.A   Quote of the Day:   I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way. -- Jessica Rabbit (Who framed Roger Rabbit)   Word of the Day: bacchanal:    n.  1. drunken revelry or reveller 2. drunkenly riotous

      Hmm, Ms Buntine, interesting to see that a week at the pub comes before catching up with long-unseen friends. Maybe you need to light a candle and assess your priorities? Anywayz, we'll still be doing coffee in London, miyah. Can't believe I'm going overseas, with absolutely no planning or even idea about where the hell I wanna go. Crazy. Actually, no - cautiously crazy.

      Yes yes good evening, I think I�m over my bitterness now, and plus I feel the urgent need to blog after  being informed that my beloved computer/best friend might be taken away on Monday �. No no no noooooooooooo�.. Anyway, yes, an update. As I was going to write in my mega fucked up entry, (you�re right Furze, this is fuckin hard to write again) I haven�t updated on Retro, jees, that seems like ages ago now, but basically the same ol� deal of really wasted people pashing/getting into fourway orgies while handcuffed to beds in crazy costumes (no, I was not involved), yeah so basically the same deal as Sleaze Ball, Get Frocked, in fact any WAAPA function, they�re all about costumes, drugs and sex (and usually in that order). In other news, Guy, I guess you should be informed that you�re now involved in an arranged marriage, I like to call it the PGB plan: P.G.B = Pseudo Gay Boyfriend. Noni, Bec and I have discovered that being the ultimate fag hags that we are, we should come up with a plan for our respective PGBs; hence: I will marry Ben [Bec�s PGB] for his love of Counting Crows, Oasis and other greats. Bec will marry Glen [Noni�s PGB] I guess for their love of Christina and Alpines And Noni will marry Guy if for no other reason than the fact he might be able to identify the 9 �filler� hits on her Bangles greatest hits cd. So that�s the plan, Guy, if you don�t like it: don�t worry, I think all the males mentioned are so overly secure in their sexuality that this will never eventuate anyway.  I�d also like to admit that I�ve been listening to a lot of �Live� throwing copper, smoking quite a lot of weed, drinking a lot of death bag, and sleeping in a tent; that pretty much sums up my life at this point.  ps- props to Laurie on her come back tour

      hey, what's up all? just a quick post to confirm that I am still breathing... been super busy with study, but enough of that. Furze, how did your big gig go? Erie, how are your drunken nights going, I haven't seen a wrap-up in a while... Guy, Sydney is just so cut-throat isn't it, even while sunning it up on local beaches and generally living it up... see you when you get back....you too Es -Laurie 'still bitter because of uni!'

      ezla. This happened to me about a week ago and I nearly cried. Now I write the whole thing in notepad or word or some shit and copy it over to the editor page. That way if it fucks up I just copy it over again. Only takes about two seconds to do. Have you ever noticed that if you write something long, witty, inciteful and meaningful - then lose it, it is IMPOSSIBLE to write it again anywhere near the same. Suddenly it's not funny or witty, just forced and boring. It's like your brain had this one window of opportunity to get this idea out and now that window is closed forever. Or maybe the idea is like sperm, once it is shot out into the air it dies and cannot be used again...uuhhh..... geez that was a horrible analogy. Please post soon buntine. Also - got pissed with your mum and dad last night foir troy's birthday... fun and games all round. But did Linda buy US jugs? Noooo... that privelege is preserved for penniless perth plebs in perpetual poverty. Aliteration rocks...

      You have no passion for your blog, Buntine. Like I said, it's cut-throat, and if you don't move it, you lose it. Today I'm writing from sunny Sydney, so maybe some of its ruthlessness is rubbing off. Everyone around me is either ruthlessly promenading, shopping, buying real estate or searching for cheap sex. Every woman is blonde, starved and inflated where it counts. Every guy seems gay, but probably isn't. Lots of VWs, lots of annoying little poodle things. Makes me long for those long, languid, empty Perth days.

      hmmm, this bloggs gone a little slow. What's happening buntine? Maybe my dixie's rant put everyone off their breakfast. Anyway here's some quotes of the day by septics about septics...  In America any boy may become President and I suppose it's just one of the risks he takes. Adlai E. Stevenson Jr. (1900 - 1965), Speech in Indianapolis, 26 Sept. 1952  The trouble with America is that there are far too many wide-open spaces surrounded by teeth. Charles Luckman  The United States is a nation of laws: badly written and randomly enforced. Frank Zappa (1940 - 1993)  England and America are two countries separated by a common language. George Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950)

Anywho, it seems Blogger has updated itself or maybe I'm just at another wierd computer, but I likes it. Back in Praha (Prague) at the shithole dorm which now seems like luxury, oh the comfort of a bed.... mmmm.... Panda and Tiff left this morning for Berlin (oh my first love) now its just Me, Piche and Marnie trapped in the ornate city of assholes. Got my photos back from Southside, and the one of me with Counting Crows came out a dream, I'm currently in the process of having it enlarged, its so great, I'm all snuggly with Adam, except Immy was the only one who didn't get his drunkass over in time to get in it, goddamnit.. Hey Kate, forgot to mention that Moloko and Beth Gibbons also played the fest but I didn't get to see em cos of clashing with others... still cryin?  And whats with this blog being so damn quitet? doesn't anyone have anything to say? I want gossip, news, stories, bullshit, anything people!!!!

      ah yes well, I knew you'd all be wildly jealous, why do you think I have this blog? Anyway, Id like to apologise for all spelling mistakes in every blog that Ive written, not the best keyboards in the world and they are german and thats hard enough! Yep, come to think of it, I really don't think I could have gone to a better festival, even tho the toilets were basically disgusting tubs of shit literally, and we didn't shower after getting grossly sweaty in 40 degree heat every day for three days and didn't get more than 5 hours sleep a night, and slept on the grass, a kiddy tent and the concrete floor of a trainstation on the last night.... see these are the down sides that I don't write about too often, but it still rocked.  Hopefully getting our visas tomoz then we'll jump on a train to Prague then I'll leave on Saturday, my flight goes Prague-Frankfurt-London-Glasgow, so it'll be my forth visit to germany in 2 weeks! fun! fun! fun! Looking forward to seeing that little winny-muffin....... aw.,... gotta go drink some more fuckin beer, its a hard life... tsch�

Erin your posts just kick home that sinking feeling I've been gestating that maybe we're all living in a cultural backwater somewhere in the south pacific and maybe there's a big wide world out there that we are all missing out on. Some dodgy festival in a medium sized German city and they cram in more unbelievable acts then ten years worth of Big Day Out's combined. It's not fair and I should be there damnit! So glad you are having such a great time though. Hurry your arse home to tell me more..but not too quickly. Glad to see this blog wake up again too!

      Ahhhhhhhhh good old blog, how I've missed you...  Ok, some of you may have heard of a few misadventures in central europe, I'd like to clear up a fe rumours.  Marnie, Piche, Tiff, Panda and I decided to go to Southside festival in a very obscure little town in southern Germany on the weekend, thinking yippieee lets just go to Germany for the weekend and go to the most amazing festival ever, see wicked bands and comehome on monday in time for flights outta prague to various places. Well, until yesterday all the that turned out pretty fuckin great, even though we were camping for three nights without a tent and me and piche without even a sleeping bag (well, piche had a white sheet but more of that later) so we went to the festival and we were on our third and final train home, crossed over the border into czech republic when the fascist passport police hopped on. Me and panda were innocently fagging in it up in the smoking carrage, calmly handed over our passports, they took one look and threw them in thier case and locked it! we were like 'um...... english?' to which he replied 'Nein!' and walked off. So basicall got kicked off the train and sent back to Germany, so we caught a train to Munich and now we're stuck here til Thursday when we can get a visa, go back to Prague get our shit and get the fuck outta that shithouse city!  Anyway.... so the festival...  FUCKING AMAZING AND WORTH ANY OF THE SHIT WE HAVE TO GO THRU NOW!!!!!!!!  Possibly the greatest, most entertaining, awesome, funniest weekend I have ever experienced, a brief lowdown:  FRIDAY: After travelling to frm Prague to Nurenburg to Stutgartt to Tullingen to the festival on trains for around 10 hours we finally arrived exhausted, anxious and delerious, got a full 3 day ticket for 90 euros, walked thru the camping ground realised everyne had deluxe setups of house tents, stoves, eskys, crates and crates of beer and food and we just stood there imagining night time when Piche would bust out her white linen sheet that she stole from the last hostel and lays it on the mud with a little vase of dasies next to her.... anyway I busted a move strait to the stage cos there was no way I was gonna miss Counting Crows. So the fest kicked off with ASIAN DUB FOUNDATION couldn't think of a better group to start a festival with the were awesme and put us in the mood to boogy with Germans, and then...... it seemed like a golden light began to shine on the stage.... ah yes... it was Adam. Of course Counting Crows were awesome, a strange set tho, can't reall remember all of it as I was standing awe but for anyne who's interested: Friend of the Devil, Four White Stallions, Rain King/Sweet Thing, Round Here, Mr Jones, Hangin Around, New Frontier, Richard Manual,  Long December, blah blah just a lotta singles really but fucking shit audience who had no idea, that was really hard to get used to, seeing bands who are most loved for their lyrics with an audience who can't understand them. After absorbing that, I had to push myself to focus on RADIOHEAD who were wonderful, I was very impressed because I thought they'd kinda callapse on the ground making wierd noises with various electronics, 'art-rock' style but no, they plaed a little something from every single album with a LIGHTING DESIGN TO FUCKING DIE FOR, in fact lighting for all bands was absolutely brilliant.  Hightlight:   spotting Adam Duritz up the back of the audience and realising the rest of the band was with him completely drunk, got my photo taken with the whole band! if it doesn't come out I'm gonna die So yeah, after dancing to german pop for a while went back to the campsite, were about to sleep on the grass in fucking freezing conditions (in the mountains) when a swiss couple simply offered their spare tent to us for the night! excellent.  SATURDAY: went into town to buy a tent, ended up buy a kiddy tent which was a square metre to put our shit in plus a few lilos to sleep out in the open again, but me and piche ended up BOTH sleeping in the kiddy tent.... with lilos.... and a white sheet ... my legs are still cramping. Saturda was cool, saw GOLDFRAPP who were pretty great, I'm not a huge fan but still loved it, Then saw LIVE, I gotta sa I was very curius considering I used to be obsessed, and they fucking rocked! Possibly one of the best acts at the fest, and the crowd went crazy for em. After that.... COLDPLAY, words cannot describe how incredible this show was, I've never seen anything like it, like 100,000 people in awe, Chris Martin even sang a few lines in German, and the lighting in ellow, even tho I hate the song I couldn't fucking move it was amazing.  Highlight:  Got pretty wasted during the day but obviously not as much as Marnie who, we discovered, scored herself a tent that night... with a hot beef injection German.... he he he oh also me and Piche in the tent having to listen to a Random running around the site screaming 'ROCK n ROLL!!!' in a German accent all night as I dreamed of having an animal tranquiliser gun to shoot him down  SUNDAY: the greatest day of all. Kicked off with the Datsuns who were crazy cool, Nothing as refreshing as genuine Rock n Roll, which is just what I was thinking when I leaned over to Panda and said 'Wouldn't it be hilarious if that random guy shouted out 'ROCK n ROLL' right now, 2 seconds later that exactly what happened! I almost pissed my pants. Cruised around a bit after that, saw SKIN do a little bit, that was cool, was frantically searching for Janelle cos I didn't know if she was coming then I spotted her backstage with INterpol just before they went on so we had a bit of a chat which was cool, but unfortunately no access backstage, meanwhile.....  INTERPOL were fucking brilliant,  I seriousl think that if i had to design every aspect of a band they would fill every category, the clothes, the hair, the good loks the colour co-ordination (Noni, you a fan yet?) and of course that brilliant, mouth-watering music...ahhhhh Then straight after went crazy with about 20 sweaty Germ gus in the moshpit for Supergrass, outta control... then kicked back on the grass to watch MASSIVE ATTACK clse the festival So all in all it was brilliant, sorr about all the ranting and raving but it had to be done. So now we're in ^Munich... great huh?   Quote of the Week:  'I am a demon and I love Rock n Roll!' - Some crazy German, possibly the most rockin thing I have ever heard

      yeah... Big Brother with guns. I mean I don't really watch TV anymore, but I've had the gross experience of watching a couple of late night eps. of this years BB, only to find that they were so hard up for interesting (ie people showering?)  things to share with the audience that they gave us a rare glimpse of two girls (albeit the most questionable two) farting in the bedroom together. This went on for ten minutes. Quality entertainment??? I don't think so. Does this crap generate ratings?

      Guys are complete idiots. If anyone needed any proof, watching four weeks of big brother was more than ample. A houseful of guys all fall over themselves trying to impress a shallow, blonde temptress who turns out to be as sincere as her tan. Watching guys try and out-macho, out-goofy and out-sensitive each other competing for a girl none of them can have was embarrasing (for them) and painful (for me). This series definetly needs an injection of alcohol and small hand-guns to keep it interesting...

      As I write I'm in my Shoreham shack, all on my lonesome, downing a few glasses of red. So I figure that, in the spirit of lonely alcoholism, I should contribute something to Erin's blog. Sounds like you're having a crazy time, Buntine. Bit of a Canadian focus, it seems. You better come back with a severe European haircut and ruthlessly stylish clothing, or you'll have travelled in vain. Nothin going on down Melbourne way, so, ah... that's it.

      Hey Yo Whoa!  Just a quickie to wish everybody in Perth a happy, smooth and successful Preview Night and show season.  A big 'go you good things' for the boys on Colour and a anticipatory Mozeltov! to all the guys on Fiddler.  Go crazy, have radical shows, and remember - the after party is at my joint so save your trashiness for Saturday night, CHEERS!!   Cheesy Music Theatre Song of the Week:    'Coloured Lights'  from the fairly unknown but brilliant and anti-cheese Kander and Ebb musical The Rink (originally starring the lovely Liza Minelli).  I think our focus this week is definitely leaning towards the LX side o things, so good luck boys.

      Hellooooooooooo! yo yo wassup, sorry its been a while, took me a week to find a net cafe in this crazy fuckin city. oh yeah confirmed... I'M IN PRAGUE. Thats right I'm here with all the kids: Panda, Tiff, Piche, Tren, Sarah, Nicky, Stan, Pete, Dave and .... No-Fuck and Pam Well I gotta say its pretty fun. Highlights so far:  DAY 1:  somehow I wake at 7am after getting 45mins sleep for my last night in Berlin, I make it to Zoo Station by 8, catch a train for 5 hours to Frankfurt Main, then catch a train to Frankfurt Airport jump on a plane to Prague, jump in a �taxi, hand the guy a piece of paper with almost incoherent scribble of obscure address on it and he somehow gets me to the dorm (which by the way is so disgusting, communal showers with no curtains... its fully big bro)   DAY 2:   Getting drunk at the Quadrenale exhibition, or should I say Stan (for those who dont know, Stan is our Santa-esque, jolly, czech workshop teacher from WAAPA/tourguide for Prague), Richard Roberts (designer and head of design @ VCA) and Petey got ABSOLUTELY SMASHED on some wierd rocketfuel. So Pete is stumbling around trying to catch up to us at the tram stop, when I threaten to msg Large and tell him that Pete is a worse drunk than Big Head, Pete goes mental and starts chasing me around the Quad, then gets on the tram, white as a ghost, head held up by Mother Te-reena, and HOSE-VOMITTING outta the tram window!! th�n we went to a posh restaurant to meet these posh people and Pete just runs to a near by bin and HOSE VOMS again only to be impersonated by some crazy czech guy standing next to him pretending to vomit... hilarious. For those who know Pete its pretty funny to imagine Trenna literally carrying him all he way home, getting abused by people and even having a bucket of water thrown at them....oh poor Tren... ah funny times in ol' Prague.   Anyway, more fun times ahead so stay tuned.....    Special Note for Furze:  Last night me and Panda got stuck in some wierd end of town and ended up drinkin Gin in an incredibly Red Onion-esque bar til 4am, I couldn't fuckin believe it. Thought of you.

       So I'm talkling to this sound guy at a gig (wazza). He's an awesome sound man and the kind of guy who'll do absolutely anything for you within reason to make your life easier. Top Bloke. And he just got back from three weeks with the Avril Lavigne tour mixing the support act Space Like Alice. When he'd finished telling me cool tour stories, like rolling a joint for Russell Crow, I asked him if she was any good. I found his response intruiging. It was intruiging because he said "yes". Apparently her singing was great, she engaged the audience, the band were cool and the show was a killer. So if she can cut it good on her live tours why is she so phenomenally bad on TV? Rove was atrocious and Fox RoofTop not much better. Her interviews were abysmal and she came off sounding like an extra from Degrassi Junior High that had forgotten all her lines. Monosyllabic thy name is Avril. And the singing... She sounded like your little sister trying to impersonate Avril Lavigne earnestly into a hairbrush. Do the camera's intimidate her? Does she just not care about TVor the media? I'd be carefull about that last one because the media created her and could just as easily take her down.   Also everyone has to some how track down a tape of the hilarious documentry "BoyzVoiced". One fictional norwegian Boy Bands answer to Spinal Tap. It is absolutely hilarious. Especially when band management discover that BoyZone's sales went up 30% when one of the members came out of the closet. So they "out" one of their own members despite him being straight. Frickin funny shit.   Great Degrassi Lines    "it's my baby too spike"  "all the way with stephanie K!" "Joey Jerimiah I didn't realize you knew Swahili"  "Joey Jerimiah, playboy at your service, wanna play?" "Everybody wants something they'll never give up!"

       Cheesy MT Song of the Day:   "It's A Privelege To Pee"  from the absurd yet politically valid new musical Urinetown.  Five hours spent running scene changes on set today and do you think we'd get 2 minutes to use the facilities (let alone get a ciggie up ya)?  Oh no.   And Large and Sturge were right, it may just be worth Leon trying to sell his set design to Disney for the forthcoming Australian tour of The Lion King.  Change the Jews to Africans and the Rabbi into a crazy monkey and you're sitting on a winner.

      Wow Shayne!!  I've been looking for a word to define myself for so long... the blog is helpful on so many levels.  Of course, I am only a SCRUNT as of today, following the mass exodus of the des crew.  I will now have to rely on the cheesy charms or the MT society for all social engagements as I'm not prepared to live on techie time this week just to recieve some human contact/conversation.  Hello to all those OS and to all those over east.  Furze, I shall return to the big Vic in a fortnight and hope to see you play at some stage (preferably not with sexually ambiguous popstars with one name).   Cheesy Music Theatre Song of the Day:    "Poor, Unsuccessful and Fat"  from the new and exciting musical A New Brain.  Possibly an accurate description of how I will feel after spending the next fortnight with mainstream and socially acceptably beautiful, skinny and wealthy creatures that make up Music Theatre.  Gonna have to start drinking wine out of a bottle again and smoking tailors.

      Ever had one of those moments when something (u name it) mundane, that you use every single day suddenly makes absolutely no sense.  Yesterday it happened to me with money.  Some guy handed over a twenty and some shrapnel and i just stood there like a fucking moron trying to understand it.  Sometime later (maybe a minute or even two) the guy says "ummm... Are u alright?" and I looked up at him and replied "mostly okay... I just don't get money right now." and BOOM! it was over.  Suddenly I was back in a reality that included money and all of the styles with which i relate to it.  I hurried through his purchase and handed him his goods, then had to endure the wierd side ways looks of confusion/derision as he and his girlfriend left the store.    Why the fuck does this happen??  Anyway's I know that this post isn't really embracing the current international flavour of the blog, so i'll shut up now.    BTW Erin, my e-mail account is temporarily out of action due to my not having fully paid my uni fees, so I'll send u some gas as soon as I cough up some bread to the beaurocrats. In the mean time take care o yourself and have a blast in prague.  Shayne m

So yesterday I'm hangin in the laundry mat and this girl walks in looking mega cool with 'extended shag' black hair, red and black striped jacket, black pants, original 80s pointers and a Motley Crue badge, so I'm thinkin, man just when I thought Germans couldn't get any cooler... so anyway I'm like askin around if anyone can speak english to tell me how to work the fuckin washing machine and she starts talkin to me, turns out she's from New York City and just moved to Berlin that day! So we get talkin about music and stuff and makin plans to go out last night and she mentions that a couple of her friends from home are gonna come visit her in Berlin cos they're doing some gigs here, I'm like oh what band are they in (thinking I wouldn't have heard of them) and she's like " oh do you know the band INTERPOL? (!!!!!!!!!!!)" I was like OH MY GOD! and she's like I used to go out with the bass player for a while and now we're just friends but they're such nerds man...  So I'm already freakin out then she's like "oh you might have heard of the other band the YEAH YEAH YEAHS?" by that point I'm like shut the fuck up this is so unfair. So basically she gets to go to all their gigs around Germany including Hurricane festival for free..............BITCH! So yeah, Janelle is my new best friend in Berlin (and she's a hairdresser too so hopefully I'll get a rockin NY do b4 I get there) Last night I went to some crazy clubs, not much to report there except for the word "wierd" oh and also the words "need drugs". I've noticed that I'm already talking with a hint of an American accent, I can't help it! Americans and Canadians are the only people I hang out with (or should I say oooot with) cos I certainly don't wanna talk to no more Aussies.   In other news, I switched rooms today, and I just walked into my new room and the Canadian couple from the last hostel were in there! (not the sex ones, the 'getting pissed off at sex' ones) it was so funny that we all got the hell outta there at different times and ended up in the same room at the same hostel again, and they're also going to Prague next I'm startin to get freaked out.  Anywho, more reports of crazy German clubs tomorrow, I think we're going to some punk club tonight so it should be interesting.  tsch�

      Gotta love that. It's ballsy enough to have sex with someone in a dodgy hostel full of people, but then to keep going after someone asks you to stop and tells you off... You'd have to be REALLY horny. Guess there's something in the water over there. Ezla, every post makes me more and more jelous that I'm not over there wit' ya. It all sounds so beautifully bohemian, sort of like yerself. To everyone, I've just started my dream job DJing that new Rock night at room. Basically they've given me a four shift in the main room and told me to play whatever I want. It's a blast! Except when I play stuff like early stone roses, or teenage fanclub, or the cult...and nobody bloody rememebers it! Still it's a good crowd and a lot of fun. I have this state of the art DJ booth with a stocked bar fridge and my entire record collection. If anyone wants to keep me company on a wednesday night drop me a line and I'll put you on the door. (pfurze@bigpond.net.au) And no, Guy, this is not a plug. I just like sharing the experience. Gardiner I'm looking at you. Cept I start way past your bed time... ;)I even play the occasional slice of Mr Ryan Adams. Buntine keep buying cool CD's, I want to get my hands on them, I'll send you cash and you can mail them to me....yeah!??

      EEEWWW Buntine that is NASTY!!! Did they talk dirty in some foriegn language?  Heeeyyyy AAANNNNNNNNAAAA of course I remember my Tie-bo fitness freak! Hope life is treatin you well! You gots to get your ass back to Oz and do the Jane Fonda work out video with us again!! Ohh Buntine! Camille, Laurie, Bridgie, Elanor, Gibbo and I went out with Winny and Simon last night to the city and got wasted at 9th Ward dancing to daggy 80's music with an alternative crowd. To give you an example of the crowd there was a guy (that I personally feel is laurie's secret partner), wearing a white lab coat with thick rimmed classes! Anyhow, tainted love came on and we all suluted you and wished you were there!  Ps I lost my job cause David Jones Food Chain has gone bust and is closing all its stores... ooohh life of the unemployed.

       WELL IT FINALLY HAPPENED:   I wondered when it would, but I wasn't expecting it so soon. Last night, people had sex in the bed next to me. It was HORRIFIC!  Here's me calmly half asleep with my headphones on, and then in between songs, i kinda heard this squeaky noise and thought "no it cant be..." turned down my music and realised there was quite a lot of squeaking.... squinted my eyes open for a split second and now that split second is permanently tattood in my mind ew ew EW!!! Fully butt-naked just goin for it full on, the others in the room were trying to make noises (unzipping bags, rustling around) to make it obvious that they could hear them, but they just kept going.... I was dying, sitting there praying that somebody would say something and nobody did, so finally I make a half turn and say "HEY! excuse me! In case you hadn't noticed, there are 6 other people in this room who have paid to sleep here not listen to you, if you wanna fuck then get a private room!" so they paused for a few seconds and then just kept going!!! I couldn't believe it! oh my god the noises! the horrible horrible noises...... I pretty much knew everything that went on in that bed and it went ALL NIGHT.  So hence, I checked out of that hideous hostel as soon as I could this morning (good riddance chainsmoking drunken 13 yr olds and skanky ghetto). I've moved to the city, into CIRCUS HOSTEL it fucking rocks da shit yo, all the rooms are fully decked in IKEA stuff and its got space-age showers its a dream land !!!! I can't believe I spent so much time at that other place! (Poodle, Tiff cancel your booking now)   ANNA:  You have no idea how excited I am that you're gonna be in New York!!!!! Its gonna be amazing! Can we do heaps o cheezy tourist shit together? I'm only there for a week too so it works great! Oh and I'm still living in Perth just taking a little holiday, probably moving to Melbourne at the end of the year, taking German lessons then moving to Berlin hehehehehehehehehehehe   Camille..... come back to the blog "please come back to  meeeeee pleeeease" (john travolta voice)   Purchase of the day:  Ryan Adams "Gold" for �5.99 AMAZING! ... gotta stop buying CDs

      Hey everyone...HI KATE! Do you remember me? I could never forget you and your poppy lip gloss...you stud. Anyway, yeah! I'll bein New York July 18---? maybe a week and then I'm cruising back to Michigan. You are welcome to join me baby! I'm soo excited you'll be in NY---I would've been pissed had I missed you on this grand fantastic tour of my country as I was moving from the west coast. So- YAY! Have you totally moved from Perth or are you still semi-there? Saturday I think I'm going to see Keanu Reeves play in Hollywood. His new band's name is Becky and they will probably suck but at least I can see him, and hopefully some other celebs! :) Have a great one!

      I've been chastised for not blogging, so let's go: New Jewel video sucks; Avril Lavigne is a little snot; Beyonce is AMAZING... new video is BEYOND AMAZING; Madonna has been unfairly panned; can't wait for Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle... ready for the Mac Attack; Hungry Jacks is superior to BK, but they're soon to merge, so that's kinda irrelevent. Glad you're having crazy times in Germany Erin!

      Buntine, you HAVE to see DJ Bobo, and take photos with him, and whilst posing for a photo make a peace sign like a japanese tourist.  PS I Lost my Job, Winny is back in the hood, better than ever, me and McKeown went over and saw her the other night, Simon is GORGOUS, funniest bastard ever and does a great Axl Rose impersonation, Winny, McKeown and I got majorly wasted with Kate and danced the night away in Yazzaville. You will have the BEESTT time is Glasgowe with Win and Sime. Its was totally weird though, I just laughed alllll niiiiggghhhtt long and suffered possibly the WORST hangover ever.   PPS IF YOU DON'T STICK AROUND FOR THAT FESTIVAL I WILL PERSONALLY CHOP YOUR BOOZIES OFF.... that is the most SUPREME line up, all we have here is Splender in the frigging grass and thats Crap.  "I was rollin dice in the allie when Officer Leighroy came up and said  "I thought I told you kids..." and I'm like whatever"

      Hello everybody.  Im in a slight state of dilemma. The bank wont give me any cash so theres a strong possibility that I WONT be going to the Dandy Warhols tonight.   FUUUUUCCCCKKK!!!!  In other bitter news ....  WHY THE FUCK DIDNT I KNOW ABOUT THE GERMAN HURRICANE FESTIVAL?!!!!  it is the most amazing line-up I have ever heard, check it out:  COLDPLAY, MASSIVE ATTACK, BJORK, RADIOHEAD, Underworld, Guano Apes, nofx, ZWAN, Millincolin, Turbonegro, The Roots, Seeed, COUNTING CROWS, Apocalyptica, Patrice, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sigur Ros, MOLOKO, Beth Gibbons, Fu Manchu, SKIN, Asian Dub Foundation, The Hellicopters, SUPERGRASS, Anouk, Good Charlotte, Console, Slut, Starsailor, GOLDFRAPP, INTERPOL, Gus Gus, International Pony, Nada Surf, THERAPY? , THE DATSUNS, Grandaddy.... and more     And when is this wondrous event I hear you ask? Its over June 20 - 22.  Thats right when Im not in Germany.  And when does Dave Gahan play in Berlin? The day I leave.  AAAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHH but I will see him in London.  Good news is, The Cure have released a tripple CD of them live in Berlin for the Pornography, Disintergration and Bloodflowers tours.... amazing.   Well the concert thing is bad. The only gig that works perfectly for me (other than tonight) is fucking Christina Aguilera. WHY IS THAT BITCH CONSTANTLY WORKING HER WAY INTO MY LIFE?  Ok, I promise that this is the last thing I will complain about. Yesterday Zed saw Courtney Taylor-Taylor just chillin out the front of Brandenburg Gate, the BITCH, but its ok, cos she said he wasnt as hot in real life, he had short legs and bad shoes. excellent.  Todays events include: - shopping -more shopping - awesome modern art exhibition of over 30 awesome artists - random photo taking of various landmarks and museums - chillin in the shade looking at the funny Marx statue. - getting a tan while looking at the funny Marx statue - getting rediculously hot and sweaty and going back to hostel.  the end.

      FUCK!!!! I just spent 20 minutes writing a huge  sms only to have my phone loose power the moment before i sent it... How will i survive this, (the most boring shift ever in the history of my job) without some form of idiosyncratic technological communication to whimsically while away my bosses money.  I love the riskless, pseudo-intimacy of sms. NOW WHAT!!  I guess i'll have to talk to one of the people i work with....

      i think it would be a good idea for me not to read the blog for at least another 3 days.  when the only exciting thing in your day is a class where you don't have an assessment, its incredibly depressing to read about people having fun and being happy and shit. as if life in perth isn't bad enough, my mum has got me working my arse off when i eventually get back to the G-long homestead - i'm gonna be working in the fucking deli at fucking coles!!  i did not work my way up from junior console operator to intermediate console operator in 6 years at bp to work in the fucking deli at fucking coles during my only fucking holiday.  right, now that thats out of the way, erin, have a look for an album by scottish band idlewild... i am told they're the new Smiths.  Furze, please please please come over and visit me, take me away from the evil and freakishly small directors, cockney dance teachers with tattooed eyeshadow and peterpan-ish stuttering music lecturers.  now that erin is away, although i have much more money and i'm listening to much happier music, i have noone to drink or do drugs excessively with - hmmm, could have something to do with why i have more money.  everyone here is so damned sensible.  oh yeah erin, since it is totally unfair that you get to see the dandy warhols live when you have no future life-soundtrack plans for them, i insist that you go for a stroll during my walking song.  don't forget to wave to people like you know them, pull down imaginary glasses to check people out, glance at yourself with satisfaction in anything reflective... you know the drill.    Cheesy Music Theatre Song of the Day:   'The Cave' from the unpopular but surprisingly good (considering the absolute shit america is churning out these days) Floyd Collins.  Really just a reflection on Saturday night...

      yo yo yo, Hey! Anna-Banana joins the blog!!!! you go girl! the first international blogger on #Go Blind#, excellent. Ok, regarding my U.S dates, I havent got em on me right nowbut pretty sure I get into New York around July 17 and stay for a week or ten days then a couple of stopovers in Denver, Sacremento then on to L.A for an unlimited time so hook up with me girl! I hope to god you`re gonna be in at least one of those places cos I dont know NOBODY yknow what Im saying?  Anyways, still in Berlin, become real good pals with an awesome chick from Manchester: Zed. We went to the coolest place evr last night. Its this real old building that used to be the first German "shopping Mall" but was taken over by the Nazis and used as a block of offices and then it was half-bombed and abandoned, because nobody claimed it a whole bunch of artists started squatting there. So now its like  a giant comune of artists studios there not a square inch that isnt painted or grafittiied, theyve set up a few clubs in there and an awesome bar on the roof of the studios, its so cool man! I wanna live there! you just walk around  drinking and sitting around in thier bedroom/studios and look at art!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my heaven..... and everybody offers you so many drugs for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  oh baby.

      ahh, perth parties. Another part of that euthereal world in which reality and sobriety take a back seat. a bunch of incredibly creative people all hell bent on shagging someone and taking mind-expanding drugs in a state where there's enough hot nights to make it happen all week. Who am I kidding, I wish I was there right now. Noni you drama queen, feel like putting me up for a couple of weeks?

      Hi....ummmmm....Erin, I don't really know how this blogger thing works, but I think it's just like a post-thing. When are you coming to America? and when will you be in London? Wanna wait until I get there? :) Bummer about missing Nick Cave! I'll miss like 4 Tori shows because I'll be back in Michigan and outta CA by then. But I think I'm flying to Phoenix to see my Dad and will go to a couple while I'm out there...I couldn't miss a whole leg of the tour! Come on now! HOPEFULLY she'll get back to London this fall.  Have you ever listened to Jason Mraz? The kid is amazing! OK, shouldn't call him a kid because I think he'd my age, but he is my latest new music. I saw him play in San Diego a couple of weeks ago and he was soooo good. He's got a funky, jazzy kinda groove thing goin on, and his voice is so pure. He really knows his voice and sings like he knows exactly where to put the sound. I was, and continue to be, thoroughly impressed! I just can't get enough... I had a really exciting weekend! I went to Disneyland and California Adventure for the first time in my 25 years and it was really fun! I was chosen (you'll love this erin) to dance in the afternoon parade through Disneyland. I was in a special group that got to dance with Disney characters...I got Niko from Pocohontas. :) They rushed us through this really complicated routine, stuck a purple satin cape with stars on it on me, and there we went. Despite not really knowing what I was doing, it was still really cool. The kids were waving at me like I was a celebrity (probably only becuase I was dancing with a raccoon) Saturday I busted up Hollywood to The Derby. If you've seen the movie "Swingers" then you'll recognize it as the last bar they were in when he was swing dancing with Heather Graham. I had an absolute BLAST! Even better than the apple martinis were my fistful of partners, all quite good, which made me look REALLY good! I didn't get flipped or anything, but I was a swing dancin machine! Yesterday I went to the beach in Santa Monica and joined a group of people I didn't know (who were actually from Russia and knew very little English) in a game of sand volleyball! It's always an adventure... Well, guess that's all for now---hope to see you SOON! :)

      Ok Berlin is like officially the coolest place I have ever been! Im pretty sure Ill be saying that about a number of places, but I seriously dont think I could love anywhere as much as here, and I havent even been to any clubs yet! Did the famous 5 hour walking tour today, thats right, Erin walked for five hours, and god damn I wouldve walked for more. This city has the most amazing history, art, clothes, music, architecture (young and old) and stories! millions and millions of stories.... man I really wanna live here, if only I could speak German.   Anywho, thank you Shayne for giving me some kind of stuff to giggle about regarding that party... although Noni going home with Sturge is funny enough in itself.   Oh yeah story of the day: Ok we were in the middle of the tour and Ive never felt so wierdly american in my life. Our guide was American (meanwhile he was one of the most amazingly intelligent young people Ive ever met) and he was like "Ok, so this is Brandenburg Gate which Napoleon changed from a peace gate to a victory gate in the year blah ... and then it was inaccesable for 28 years due to the Berlin wall making this entire section of Berlin No mans land, (turns around) and if you look to your left thats the hotel that Michael Jackson recently hung his baby out of." *crowd "oh"s in recognition of something they understand finally* .... hilarious

      Well "The Krazenstein Affair" certainly was a party of a different order, featuring all the things that make a party special.  But add to this the 2 limo's out the front for the guests use (ie. cigarette runs etc), the fantastic finger foods and some genuinely moving moments as the Kraz and his family gave considered and heartfelt speeches (i usually hate the formal side of these gig's but Kraz's was kinda cool).  However, on the subject of one particularly repellent drunk ( a girl who shall only be known as Big Head) who forfeited her dignity yet again as she publically spurned her arch nemesis (who else but Sturge!!).  "You ruined my life" she cried.  "Fuck off." he replied eventually, after she had told him this for the umpteenth time in front of various assembled party goers. Now Big Head is for all intents and purposes a nice chick (albeit with a  "BIG"  hair do).  But to completely abdicate responsiblity for shagging Sturge (who i love but is really not uncommonly CUNTY to chicks) is kinda crap.  One thing i'll say for sturge is that if he has to put any more than a cursory effort into getting some then he's really not interested.  SO GO FIGURE... He ruined her life????   Not bloody likely.  Maybe it was a bad decision to shag Sturge (probably has been for other chicks 2). But it was still her decision.  Stop being a victim Big Head!!!  There u go Erin, is this the gossip u crave??!!

      Well I cant believe thats all the feedback Im gonna get from what was amped to be the "party of the year", something cool must have happened! I want details!! Anyway my update is that now that Im kind of over the jetlag thing Im starting to have a really good time, the hostel Im at is a busabout stop off so theres a fresh batch of aussies and kiwis every couple of days. Imet a guy from Melbourne yesterday who mysteriously has the exact same taste in music as me, which is quite wierd when you think about it. Anyway, as I only met him yesterday, he goes to me "so, did you go to the Nick Cave concert last night?" i was like WWWWHHHHAAAATTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! god damn nick cave played on the day I got to Berlin and I didnt fuckin know and Silverchair played on friday night supported by Something for fuckin Kate!!!!! god damn..... ok gotta calm down its too early in the morning to get so bitter. Good news is that the Dandy Warhols are playin in a couple of days so Im certainly going to that, Noni, Ill listen out for the walkin music. And can some melbs peaople please start blogging! I need to hear updates from home!

      Ah, post trashiness Sunday.  I think I'm right in saying none of us have ever attended a more extravagant party than Big Kraz's do last night.  One word that comes to mind... luscious.  Food, drinks, alcoholic slurpies (although they did bring back cringe-worthy memories of Frostbites) - amazing. Yet, unfortunately no unbelievable gossip to share.  At all.  I guess you could call me going home with Sturg gossip-worthy but only if it had have been several hours earilier a la Shayne and Piche, fortunately things were entirely platonic and based on sobriety. I wasn't impressed this morning when i was woken up by Leon just wanting a chat at 11:30 despite seeing him all night long, and even less so after he passed his phone around what seemed like the entire party to have a talk.  Then of course was the ASTL. The Annual Singing Teacher Luncheon at 2pm today.  Nothing better than coming down in the company of  a 65 year old woman in a hot pink pantsuit (and the biggest gunt in the world) and not being able to smoke for 5 hours because 'of course I've quit Leslie!'.  Oh god. Yeah.  Great party.  Nothin more to say.

      Hello!!!!!!!!!!!! and greetings from crazy-ass Germany, where I just then discovered even the keyboard config is wierd.  Well I gotta say Im pretty proud of myself so far, somehow after being on no sleep since thurs nite I managed to catch myself a train from Frankfurt Airport to Berlin and then to my hostel in da ghetto without speaking a word of German and not catching a taxi once (though that was kind of foolish - damn trekking round the ghetto for hours in 30 degrees with 40 kilos stuck to my back)  Anywho story of the day: I get on the train to Berlin, and naturally get kicked outta first class (oh Im sorry, I didnt know! I dont speak German! hehehe) anywho Im wading through the drunken screaming soccor crowd in the pub carrage when this guy stops me and says something in German then realised I didnt have a fuckin clue what he was saying then goes "why are british girls the sexiest girls in the world?" Im like oh fuck.... then he forces me to sit down and buys me champagne and full German breakfast ... cant handle anymore fuckin meat.... so at this point Im not complaining then hes like "come and stay with me in Berlin I stay in five star hotel you live like a queen I buy you anything you want I love you!! so I start freakin out and then he starts getting all touchy and I gave the guy opposite this "help me" look and he leans over and says to "Phillipe" some stern German shit, Philipe gets all outraged starts shouting shit and everybody starts looking in horror, a huge fight breaks out and Im just sitting there with my backback with no idea what is goin on, so I escaped his clutches dodged through the crowd and hid for the rest.... time running out more later

      Hello there, Yes as everyone can probably gather I am back in Melbourne town after what ended up being stuck in planes/airports for 24 hours  without one cigarette  hence I threatened the boy sitting behond me with near death if he kicked my seat one more time.  But its good to be back, I feel like Mr. Cotteeeeeeeeeeeeeer.  I was looking forward to cold weather but this is just rediculous, I think 4 degrees during the middle of the day is pushing it a bit, gots to buy me some jimmy-jacks. Well, feel free to call me peoples (and not at 5am whilst wasted Rebecca!) tchuss

      Goddamn me to hell for beginning strange new phase of homework-doing-ness and staying away from porch and puter.   Erin, oh Erin.  Seeing Urinetown on Broadway... Oh Erin.  You know I rarely get passionate about music theatre unless its quite integral to our society...  Oh. Erin.  You didn't see it.  Did you.  My greatest aim in life was to get you to see one show that you would love for non-depressive reasons and I missed my chance to tell you 'yes Erin!  see it!  a musical about shit and piss -  this  is why i love musicals!' because I was researching fucking Streetcar (might I add I will be playing the AMAZING Blanche Dubois) and Shakespeare. I think the only thing to do now is to go home, drink the 6 week old death bag (in bed) and get right onto the half finished pornographic musical, Venus.  And since its been so long...   Filthy (and still cheesy) Music Theatre Song of the Week:   One of the more censored songs from  Venus ,  'Whorehouse'   (CHORUS) Whorehouse, You can call it your house, Forget about your spouse, Its a whorehouse!  In the park, in the diner, Put it in my wet... (CHORUS)

PANDA I LOVE YOU...... thankyou for the message the other night it went straight to the heart. Melbourne has been raining for like a week straight, I love it, it beats gail winds and clouding skys! Its all or nothing in my book no in between. Hey Hannah when you moving to Melbs to start your boutique? Panda HAS to move to Melbourne cause Kate Cherry is here! Why don't all the Perth people move to Melbourne for a year!! I think that's a great idea, Melbourne needs some melodrama and I need some drinking partners! ...... I feel like i'm having a conversation with myself so I think I'll go...  ALBUMS I PURCHASED TODAY: Mars Volter....ooohh baby                                              Sigur Ross..........oooooooohhhh baby                                              In Utero ........... an olde but a goody!

      sorry about the phone call yesterday buntine, could only hear every second word you were saying and was shitting me because i didnt know the content of the stories you were saying so i was finding it a bit difficult to stick the pieces together. anyway i'll call you when you back at old hughesie, maybe we can create a long-distance form of bession? Safe travels girl good luck with the whole 22 hour flight/ no smoking thing - glad im not sitting next to you.

       I dream I'm in New York City some nights... Angels float down from all the buildings. There's something about an angel that just kills me... I keep hoping something will I keep hoping, I keep hoping, I keep hoping   -Adam Duritz   Ok mega depressing quote... but I'm killing time before my airport pickup, and now thinking I don't wanna leave this city... I'm tossing up between Berlin and here to live, maybe a bit of both, one day when I have millions of dollars. Decided the plan is live in Perth for another 3 months, then back to Melbourne until March next year when I move to Berlin for 6 months, save some money there to live in NYC.  Whoa, thats a plan and a half. Anyone with me? I know Snacky-poodle-panda's coming back to Berlin, man, thats gonna be so cool. Ok gotta go chain smoke before my 22 hour flight............. aggggggggghhhh thank god I've got patches, see y'all back in Oz

       Its happening baby; They're putting up the chairs, taking the money And all you can do is pray, pray for tomorrow. So close your eyes, close your mouth Do this all in time to the music That screams like a child in the back of your mind... So goodnight Hollywood boulevard, goodnight I'll see ya sometime, yeah right.   Thanks shayne, yeah Panda emailed me, thank fuck we've got a new lease cos I would be screwed! Ok I think I've well and truly done NYC, today checked off everything left on the 'to do' list :Little Italy, Chinatown, SoHO, Brooklyn Canal St all in one afternoon, man I've got this tourist shit doooooown muthafucka.  Don't worry Gardiner, I already have you something thats both music and nyc related, its very cool, but don't expect anything big, cos I got no money and no space to put it! but it is cool...  Anna- I'm going back to Shout@13 tonight to try and re-live the trashiness of last week, but now I've got my own rocking mesh hat so I don't think anybody will be giving me theirs (let alone the fact that I can't dance like you girl!)  Noni- Is it worth my sacrificing my last night here to see Urinetown? probably shoulda gone earlier huh... oh well.... I miss you diva, don't worry I'll pick us up another fuck-off bottle of Gin (mother's ruin) to down on da porch when I get back  party on wayne

      CONGRATULATIONS SPANS! You finally worked it out, I'm very very proud, keep up da good work! Yeah I'm going back to Perth via Melbs for a week, should arrive on da westsi-eeeede  around the 10th of August....  Gardiner, Guy does have a tank top, McKeown bought it for him, you know you can't hide it Yug.  Went to MoMA today and gotta say I was pretty disappointed as it was the gallery I was looking forward to the most, only to find it had been relocated to Queens with have the usual works on display. Did see a very early Rothko tho, Plus a special exhibition of Andy Warhol's screen tests (which was fucking brilliant) and an Ansel Adams exhibition which was also pretty cool, so I can't really complain now that I think about it.    Thing that I hate today:  One of the fucking arsehole guys in my hostel who is so sleazy, rude and disgusting that I wanna vomit everytime I see him, I've never disliked someone so much in my life.   Thing that I love today:  Weather, it just changes your mood so dramatically, also just started noticing tiny details in everything I see, it gives a whole new perspective   Thing that I'm wierded out by today:  The fact that Luther Vandross' new album is called 'Dance with my Father' (??????) and that fact that I kissed a 40 year old English Guy in a Goth club last night.... what the hell am I doin'? craziness  outty

      Hi all think i have finally worked out this blog thing after reading the gossip from around the globe for the last few months. thought since buntine was almost returning to the land down under i should get my arse into gear and join the party. chances are i wont be able to comprehend this process again with my retarded computar mind so enjoy my brief hello while it lasts.  so now im part of the gang have realised i actually dont have anything of note to write about, melbourne buntine? what about the sunny west coast girl?  kate if you are an intuder i am feeling like fucking anouskhka, minus the brit accent and previous life as a kindy teacher of course.........well enough of the big bro metaphors, yay im a blog girl, cheers!

      Hey Buntine... Yeah, I know---NYC was meant for you and me and I feel bad that you are there without me! Have you gotten your tattoo? Greg and I would love loVE LOVE to come and see you again, but financial strains will keep us nestled in North Carolina. You are going to D-I-E...so we get home at about 4 AM after driving 12 hours, plus 2 hours getting back to the car in Newark (Greg leading me by the hand as we got DRENCHED getting to the bus...with my Petoskey sweatshirt and my lei from our beloved 13) Greg checks his email to see what time the meeting was the next morning. He finds a new email sent on Monday informing everyone that the meeting was CANCELLED! I know you are dying right now and so were we. We couldn't believe it. :( We spent most of yesterday sleeping and doing laundry. Today we went swimming, I filled out my 20 NYC post cards, and Greg made us fajitas for dinner. I'm really bummed out because I wish I could come back, but I just got an email that said I would not have a permanent teaching position in London this fall and they will try for January '04. :( I wish I had heaps of money so I could not care about it and take a flight back...I wish Kate had heaps of money too so that I could be her personal trainer and all of our worries would be over! ha ha Aaah, just remember that everything happens for a reason and I guess we were supposed to leave NYC when we did...not sure why. I hate goodbyes. It was funny to hear you say you like squirrels because I totally forgot that they are fascinating to Australians. My friend Tracy loved them while she was in Michigan. Oooh, and we have LOTS of them in Petoskey...another reason you should come visit. ha ha Greggy sends his love. He's in the other room playing blues on his guitar. Miss you! PS--> living in Melbie is DEFINITELY an option now that I'm not going to London! :) Ask Lynda and Greg if they want another child...

      Man I am a lucky, lucky girl.  IT FINALLY HAPPENED>> IT WAS DESTINY>> IT WAS MEANT TO BE   I FINALLY MET DAVE GAHAN.   oh baby................................  Thats right I spent one whole day outta my ten here lining up for his instore at Tower records (where I found out today, Brittany Spears lives on top of) So it was 5 hours of being 2nd in line of about 400 people. After an hour, the security guy, Jimmy, says hey if you're gettin bored there's a cool bar on the next block, so he takes me there, buys me 3 beers and takes me back to my position in the line, man it made the 4 hours go a lot faster. Then we got let in, I was literally less than a metre away from Dave in front row, then got a VIP pass from Jimmy to meet him and get my shit signed. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!! Can't believe how lucky I am, seeing as I'm on a roll I should go to Ryan's bar tonight.... yeah...

      Guy, you watch toooooo much television!!! I can so see you and Marty on "The Block" in your tank tops and your over camp bravado's!!! Get off the couch and get a job writing colums for TV Week, you'd be great, plus they REALLY need a re-vamp!  Aahhh Buntine, After speaking to you today I felt so bad about telling you Melbourne is shit! What I really meant was COME HOME WE MISS OUR BUNTINE. Every time you come home you bring so much fun and drinking and peer group pressure! I miss that, I miss having nobody to watch 80's movies with! I miss having someone that likes the same old dindgy pubs as I do! I miss having someone to get really drunk and talk music shit with!! Melbourne opens it's arms and embraces you buntine like a stubby holder embrases a Vic Bitter!!!!   So there are a few negetives about coming home! Its all good we all deal with it, Parents, no cash and bordom, but you will reignite the passion for fun when you come home!   Good Luck in NYC, don't be scared, I've been told you can spend 24 hours a day in Broadway because there is always a show on, always lights and always people! If not go and sleep in the Gugenhiem!!! Go visit Carson Daily at TRL! Go into Tiffanys and ask to try on a 24 carret diamond ring! Stake out celebrity's houses whilst eating hot dogs and spilling coffee down your shirt! Buy a great book and sit in Central Park and read it! Go and see David Gahn and tell him how much you love him!   See you next week Buntine xo  PS Anna when I'm rich and famous I will fly you and Greg to Melbourne so you can be my person fitness consultant!

       Well, I shuffled through the city on the 4th of July  I had a firecracker waiting to blow  Breakin' like a rocket who makin' its way  To the cities of Mexico  Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A  I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th  Had myself a lover who was finer than gold  But I've broken up and busted up since   And love don't play any games with me  Anymore like she did before  The world won't wait, so I better shake  That thing right out there through the door  Hell, I still love you, New York   Ah, the inevitable Ryan Adams quote.   Was gonna save it til I saw him but don't think its gonna happen cos I'm too shit-scared to go to bars in alphabet city solo. ANNA!!!! PLEASE COME BACK TO ME! PLEEEEEEASE!!!!! Convince the gregster to come back, he knows he wants to!!! How did his meeting go?  Anyways,   Gardiner,  You can just tell young Ryan that he aint gettin in on NONE of my hip NY connections, its you and me baby, and any other Goblind-Interpol-fan-bloggers.    Thing that I hate today:  And not just today, everyday: fucking people in art galleries who think they know what they're talking about simply by walking up to a painting and going  "ah yes, Kline"   or  "Now this is a classic example of the transgression from blah blah  etc. ITS PISSING ME OFF!!! I can't believe people actually say this shit out loud for all to hear. Discman was on for the rest of the exhibition.   Thing that I love today:  Central Park, every time I go there I find something cooler... today it was squirrels

      No, no, I haven't vanished into the ether as people seem to be whispering. I've merely been enjoying some down-time on the couch due to a nasty respiratory virus, with added tonsil puss. It's like down-time from down-time. But back to uni in a few days, so I should be revving up to a... light work load. Very happy to recieve a phone call from Ms Buntine this morning. She seems to be doing New York in style. Lots of cwoffee and giant pretzels, it seems. Looking forward to seeing you in Melbs.  So, what's been goin down? Well, it's old news now, but my best wishes go out to Delta... you were "born to try" etc etc. Good thing Big Bro's over cause I'm over it. OH MY GOD Vincent shits me.  Total psychopath! What a little, little man underneath the bravado (it seems). Gretel is still tops, however. Touched to see her shed a few tears during the final eviction. WELCOMING BACK Oprah's bookclub... it was gone too long, and you can order your Oprah's bookclup T Shirts and Tote bags at Oprah.com. Intrigued by Christina Aguilera touching down on our shores. I think I may be beginning to respect her, mainly because her last two singles (beautiful and fighter) seem to be referencing the fact that the whole world thinks she's a total skank. Nothing else worth commenting on that I can think of. Except to say that I've been enjoying Auction Squad... seriously!

BUNTINE you'd better come back to Melbs for this!  Andrew, I don't know if I could handle tour managing! I mean I'm good at organising and shit but I don't know about the shitty hotels and food and bad moods and arsehole venue managers and arsehole everyones. I'm going to try and get some work experience with Glen Wheatly an Johnny Farhnam, Its not my first choice, but I'm starting to run out of options!  I'm trying desperatly to get a gob at sanity or virgin (again not my first option), because apparently the only ways to get into the circles are through retail or administration.   HELP... I'm screwed..... and anyway who the hell am I going to tour manage!

       On a rooftop in Brooklyn One in the morning Watching the lights flash In Manhattan I see five bridges The Empire State Building And you said something That I've never forgotten   -PJ HARVEY   Hi there, well today's headlining lyrics are pretty fitting, did a lot of sight seeing, including photos of Greg holding a bottle of DC and a book in front of the staue of Liberty, getting drenched with rain holding boxes on our heads in front of the Empire State and generally escaping rain the rest of the time. Man, this city spins me out, so many hotdog stands, loud construction workers, random steam shooting outta places, cracked sidewalks, bright lights, car horns buy buy buy! its crazy. Nonidiva, I saw RENT last night and I have to say it was absolutely incredible, i fucking loved it, bit of a laugh, bit of a cry, fun for the whole family. Plus the guys in it were extremely hot. So I'm gonna try and come home straight from here via Melbs cos I don't think I can handle Hollywood after this, but I'll see how I go.  Kate start finding rockin places to take Carlos, I'm relying on you!

      interpol really do rock. Been playing a bunch of their shit down at RockRoom - trying to educate the masses. THey're kind of like the Strokes you can really like.   P.S If any melburnians want to come scum free drinks off me at Room on Wednesdays you can say my name at the door for free entry any night. I kick off at 12. Great to see Gardiner back in action on this blog. WTF is Guy doing? Have you dissappeared? You are the only one here who writes anything intelligent and we all rise to your standard when you are around.   Gardiner you've got to get into tour management: 1) because you'd kick arse at it. 2) because, believe it or not, there's a shortage of talent and 3) because you'd have a ball and it would stop you being unemployed and shit. I think the secret is to rock up on the first day of a band's tour and just start organising people. Everyone will assume that you are the tour manager and your career will blossom from there....just a thought

      second post is ...   New York cares (Got to be some more change in my life) The subway she is a porno The pavements they are a mess I know you've supported me for a long time Somehow I'm not impressed It is up to me now, turn on the bright lights     OH MY GOD!!!!!! last night was amazing!  So me, Anna and Greg have been hang-chillin in NYC gettin really drunk and partying with the cool crowd at all the bars on my invaluble list from Janelle.  So I'm dying to see somebody famous, although I'm sure 60% of the people around me were. Last night we went to this bar called Shout @bar 13, looked pretty bland from the outside, meanwhile we got in there and its like awesome 60s soul rock music with so many cool kids just hangin out and drinkin. Anyway, so I went to the 'bathroom', was on my way back to Anna when I spot Carlos from Interpol ordering a drink!!!!!!!! almost died... spent the next hour working up the drunkeness to talk to him, finally did, we chatted for a while I told him how i knew Janelle and saw them play at southside, then he's like "well hey, if youre gonna be in Melb in about 2 weeks I think we're doing some shows, i can put you on the list here's my email address'!!!!!!! so i'm like cooooooooll then he goes, 'yeah so i don't know ANYBODY in Australia so maybe you can take me out after the show?' I was like YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHH BABY! (in my head) but of course out loud i'm just like 'oh yeah, thatd be cool' .... Amazing!

       HEY I'M IN NEW YORK! I GOT A GUN LET'S GO TO A BROADWAY SHOW!   oh man, I've been waiting so long to write that!   So I'm in the majorly BIG apple, man, this place is outta control, I can't comprehend it and I've only been here for one day! My hostel is in Manhattan near the corner of 57th and Park Ave, so as you might imagine its not exactly a hostel, its got a ficking doorman for fuck's sake, which I just realised I should probably be tipping, oh well, he can see that I'm poor. I just did my best to freak out all the Manhattan bitches, by wearing a lotof black and studded shit down Madison Ave, ha hahaha so funny, they all walked past looking like the most hideous monsters I have ever seen, bad print pant-suits, larger than life whitish blonde hair, little dogs, and if their faces got lifted any higher they'd be applying their crimson lipstick to their forehead! I can't believe they exist... oh and other people I can't believe exist are high-rolling rap dudes, just walked past these guys on the corner wearin hiphop kinda business clothes, sayin 'yeeeeh imma go down the cluuub tnight n see bout dat girl, cos she was fine yknow what i'm sayin?' man i feel like steve martin in that hideous movie i watched on the plane with queen latifah.... so many bad white boy jokes...  enough rambling,  ps- every entry from now on will be intro'd with lyrics such as.... 'New York! New York! Its a wonderful town!'  ... although not as cheesy that you can't read it without crackers.  pps- Furze congrats man, i want as many pictures of skankgirl without make-up as possible....   ppps- Guy! why you no blog no more?  pppps- Moe! why you no speak with your accent no more!

      Congratulations Furze!  If Guy isn't interested in taking up the roadie position, I know of a misled young man in Geelong who's just waiting for someone to yank him away from his Mariah (not so loveable slut) and send him in the right direction, back to the white-trash diva (no, not me) Christina he once loved so well...  Glen, if you're out there , this could be your chance.

      Andrew, although I am enjoying the book enormously, I cannot help but draw some connection between Dolly Pickles and myself.  By continuing my lifestyle of excessive fun, my biography (unofficial most likely) will no doubt quote directly from Cloudstreet.  The following phrases come to mind...  "You were always a hateful bitch.  A drunken slut." "...puking and moaning, until in the end there was only her heart and lungs to eject..." "...the smoke and grog were curing her, making her face puffy and shredded with lines.  Her teeth were yellow... And her voice, she was going croaky."  Is Tim Winton some ghost of Diva Future sent to make me re-assess my life?

      Forgot to mention the other day that its bloody great to see young Prudence in on the blog! good on ya love, keep it up! I also forgot to mention that I didn't actually buy some funky records with that old motown sound, but i did in fact buy the greatest depeche remix compilation I have ever heard.... listening to it right now  words are very unnecessary they can only do harm ... i've discovered that depeche's overly simple lyrics account for their massive popularity in Germany, but I can't think about it anymore... yes I missed the fucking Dave Gahan concert, it was on Thursday night, I couldn't have gone anyway. it was sold out months ago, but of course I had to run into a bunch of crazy Germs in Dave Tshirts yelling the lyrics to 'I Feel You' in Trafalgar square... grrrr.... So I guess other than that, this giant monopoly board city is treatin me pretty well, I'm rather disturbed at Zac's ability to turn me into such a romantic fool, going for strolls down the Thames, drinks at dusk, afternoons in Hyde Park, what am I? 35? lucky there's some hard drugs in between all these things or I'd be totally spinning out! I think I better bail on the trip to Paris, its just way too much. Can some fucking Perth people start blogging? Noni McCallum I'm looking in your direction, and Mr. Miller, how'd ya go with the challenge? and where have you been all my life? And Anna banana I'll see YOU in NEW YORK!!!!!

Well that pretty much sums up the first part of my post, Im literally standing in an internet phone booth in the middle of the Camden markets where I have just spent a  ridiculous amount of money on crap but its so funky and cool.... reminded me of why I wanted to come here! ok Ill let the Waifs intro part two...   yknow its ok Im kinda happy here for now I think Ive finally grown up and got myself a lover now If I ever come home and I think I will I hope youre gonna wanna hang at my place on sundays still Oh yeah i hope you will Cos Im in London still...    Thats right, Ive gotta myself the vacation affair that I was after, Ill set the scene, Im sitting out the front of a cafe sketching, this guy runs up to go inside and stops and goes (frech accent)  2thatsbeautiful youre so talented (brit accent) dya know wat i mean?" im like where the hell are you from turns out hes french but has lived here for a few years, so we had some drinks, had some Coc, had a bit on the side and now its on for young and old! his name is Zac by the way and man can that boy dress well oh baby! so in a nutshell thats it so far, Im yet to pertake in Petes tour of London "see the sights and spew on them" but theres still time see ya

      Hey Errie... Your mom just wrote me and asked if I'd be in New York with you this weekend! You never told me when you'd be there for sure!!! She said you were leaving London July 18th...so I need you to email me your plans and where-abouts, etc. How long will you be there? Where are you going after? I just landed back in Michigan with all of my crap stuffed in my Jetta and am in the process of re-organizing and packing for London. I was planning on visiting my friend Greg in North Carolina that week but maybe we could drive up to NY and meet you there? Where are you planning on crashing? Anyway, I need to know ASAP as I need to purchase a plane ticket! if I didn't go it would be like me being in Sydney and you in Melbie and you not coming to see me! I just can't have that...it's been too long already! What do you think of London? I still need a roommate (HINT HINT) ok, email me! PS-- Joey emailed me yesterday and says hi...how are the rest of the ECU mates? and I love Shayne's challenges---I'm so happy I know what WAAPA is! ha ha :)

      Yo Buntine...  Well I've been reading this newly-global blog over the past few weeks, keeping track of your escapades, and laughing my head off at the thought of the Fuzz doing punk pop! (No offence Andrew - you know as my ex-babysitter I respect you enormously!)  Nevertheless, I have to admit I've been a bit scared to write due to the existing high standard of entries...until now.  Yes, the answer to my blogging-insecurities turned up a few days ago on the back seat of my car...in the form of YOUR LEATHER JACKET!  Oh yeah, I bet you wish you had that baby with you!  As it happens, Katie.G was the one to solve the mystery whilst over at my place last night after our 'empowering' Charlie's Angels 2 session.  Don't thank her though - apparently she still has your leather boots since her 21st last year!  Anyway mate, I gotta cruise but you just keep on trooping along - your life is about the most interesting thing in my life at the mo!  And don't worry about the jacket...I'm taking good care of it!  Cheers Bella  PS.  Hi to all the Perth people...sorry to crash your blog! PPS.  Watching Charlie's Angels last night made me regret not paying more attention to Leanne the Man in Yr 10 self-defence classes...I wanna kick some ass!

      Ahoy-hoy.... I'm still in Glasgow livin it up with home cooking, dvds, east-enders, hair-dryers, somebody doin my washin for me, riding in cars and other luxuries that I've missed so... Anyway, as expected, I've picked up a hint of an accent, you know it doesn't take long for me to start talking like anybody i'm hanging out with even if they're australian! So yeah, its not so much the accent that i've picked up, its more the slang e.g: a-ha, by the way, mingin, wee, oh ay, see that...,  etc, even though most of those words are so overused by everybody they're driving me up the freaking wall they're very catchy.  So anywho, I'm to Edinburgh tomoz and leavin for London on wednesday .... yay Edinburgh.... even tho I'm a little scared with all the ghost stories everybody has here, I think I actually experienced something kinda ghostly the other night, I don't like to think about it cos it freaks me out, but I certainly don't have any doubts about their existance anymore.   So tell me, is young Poodillusion back in Perth yet? talk to me girl! I need Berlin stories!  So all in all Glasgow has been great, seen my share of castles, and highlands, and moors, and lochs, and ghosts, and people saying wee and ay... I'm now gonna strut down to George square listen to a bit of Lou Reed and grab a wee pint.

      Well well greetings from Glasgow! Finally I made it to maroon and green land stayin with simon and winny or should i say laura, its bloody hilarious I've pretty much been drunk the whole time and eating bloody fantastic food nmmmmmmmmmmmm...even tho I'd already started stackin on the kilos from drinking to much pivo/bier/beer and eating to many chipsy/chips/chips. Must say its wierd being in an english speaking country again, getting a little bit freaked out by the ability to listen in on people's conversations for the first time in a month, even tho the scottish accent was a little overwhelming at first I'm getting used to it. Me and Winny went out last night with all her crazy scotty friends to a really trashy club and were busting crazy moves to MJ and Prince just like old times, fuckin hilarious,  by the way, my phone is outta action cos I dont have an adapter yet so I'm not intentionally being a disowning aussies biatch. Going to London on monday but probably drop in on ol manchester town on the way to track down morrissey... somebody blog!

      i always blog on sundays, and needless to say after the night that was, the concept of hungover is very familiar. thanks to all you waapa-analities who made my "its my birthday lets have a party" night a whole lotta fun. special thanks to "DJ fuck-off im mixing", you made me look very cool, mission accomplished although perhaps my drunken behaviour may have counter-acted my cool factor. thats enough thanks just realised how shit i am starting to feel. some form of miracle required to return me to human form.

      Ok shayne, I like it. Errie how was the gig?  DJ Errie B Y'all MC Ezla DJ Missy G&T DJ Surly DJ Robert Smith  Signs to be placed at entrance to the DJ Booth:  "Requests? You're fucking dreaming kid" "Warning - You are entering a high depeche mode area" "Fuck off - I'm mixing"

      Hey everyone, tonight is Erins premiere gig in Perth as a DJ. But i am fairly sure that she hasn't as yet got the most important thing (after good tunes) that no DJ should be without.   A NAME!!!  So I think that for the next few days, everyone should throw out their ideas on the blog, and then we will bestow a title upon DJ BUNTINE after dabating the merits of each proposed name.  Erin you may contribute ideas, but ultimately any DJ who names them self is wanker and everyone knows it.     And Noni, DJ BUMTIME is not an acceptable proposition (unless everyone else thinks it is anyway).  BLOGGERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!!

      Shayne you are right, the old eclectic mix of techie personalities plus the odd DJ wannabe and floral designer was back in force. Of course the mix of scotties and copious amounts of beer along with performance week and an element of spontanious party atmos, ie atmosphere for those not in the know, helped make wednesday like those debauched nights of months gone past. hope all are preparing to re-live the magic on saturday at mine, would like to think it will be another fine example of techies not knowing when the party is over.  ps shayne dont know how i escaped the aftermath of mixing beer and gin but mmmmmmmmm how delicious.

      Well, I take back everything i have blogged about scotties, and would even suggest that Wednesday night was a return to sparkling form for our little west side gang. It was to much fun.  Though i swear to god (who i only believe in when i am in pain) that i will never mix beer and gin like that again. I thought i was going to die.  Andrew, you are in dire need of chemical support.  Start the day at 6am with a solid dose of uppers (i'd recommend speed).  At around lunchtime eat a couple of zanax (a nice slow release pharmaceutical relaxant) allowing you to eat. Then top up again at around three in the arvo so you got legs until you hit the hay, but this time have some serapax with your line which will destroy all edginess and also allow you to eat dinner in a vague but socially exceptable miasma. Come bed time eat some rhohypnol but, make sure you set your alarm for 6am at maximum volume, don't forget to preset your morning line of speed for the next day. Repeat as required.  Surgeon Generals Warning: More than 3 months of this habituated use will result in a visit to some kind of rehabilitation facility, which will be a great way to catch up with Buntine, not to mention very rock n roll.  Or you could try counting sheep.

      Every one whinges about it but I have become a raving insomniac. I'm on tour with Emmanuel doing 43 instore performances in 21 days across 6 cities in 3 different timezones, catching 15 flights, staying in 5 different hotels with 2 other people and I want to kill myself. my body clock is so unalterably reversed that every night I stare up at the hotel ceiling unitil 3am and every morning I wake up at 6am to catch a plain or go to a radio station. I've been doing this for a week now and I've reached a point where I am doing everything on autopilot, without thinking or feeling. My whole body is numb and, while I crave sleep, I know I cannot have it so I pretend that it's this over-rated commodity that I don't really need to function. It's like my body has given in and is sadly accepting it's fate. And there's still two weeks to go. Last night I was in Melbourne so I DJ'd Room and didn't even go to bed. I look like shit and feel even worse. I'm starting to scare the little kids who want their singles signed with my eerie, vacant stare and the huge black rings under my eyes. Not even my favourite friend alcohol is giving me any relief. On top of this people hear what I'm doing and tell me how glamorous it must be. I want to punch them in the mouth. I'm doing this all wrong, goddamn it. This shit should only be attempted chemically assisted. Thank god we're in Perth next week. I'm gonna get the WAPA chemical lab rats to cook me up a batch of the best speedy trucker-drug cookies ever invented, something that'll keep me going for 72 hours straight, stopping for nothin'. Yeah.   If I get a inch of spare time I'm gonna tell you about emmanuel's stalkers, all named kerry, in three different states. Right now I'm off to do some more ceiling-staring. ciao

       CURSE YOU FURZE!  I'll have you know that this diet has nothing to do with any such NY bass players.... in fact I'm not even talking to him anymore I've decided its too frustrating and he's too arrogant.... too deliciously arrogant.... to talk to, so I'm ignoring until he forgets about me... but this is not to say that I won't be hookin up when he comes back. Regardless, I think I've lost faith in the entire Australian male species and will be steering clear of them for as long as possible until I move to NYC the land of hot boys/Berlin the other land of hot boys. Australian guys are re-tard-ed and have no idea how to treat a lady (present company excluded of course) I mean I want drinks bought for me! yknow what I'm sayin? what happened to the old fashioned courting and pride in being a gentleman? Its probably the rarest and most admirable quality you could possibly find, and aussies aint anywhere near it. My other beef is that the fucking  WHITE STRIPES tickets are $70!!!  this is outrageous! Cmon, the entire livid festival can't be any more than $100 right?  what the fuck makes them think they can get away with this!   ps- rest assured everybody I gave up the soup diet on the 3rd day... now I'm just eating healthy food... its bizarre

      I strongly suspect that someone's sudden fascination for the major food-group known as Soup may have something to with a certain NY Bass Player returning to our shores sometime soon and maybe someone (of course I'm completely speculating here) wants to look splendiferous for that certain other someone's return... because I suspsect as much as someone hates to admit it, some one is in luuurve.... ooooohhh wah oooohhh.....oooohh wah oooohh etc...  who is cock face? I need details. Shayne love the Prozac idea - sums up our generation nicely.

      I gotta agree with you Shayne about the whole soup diet shinanigan...Erin, you are beautiful---don't sweat it. Be so happy with the way you are.  And I think I'm still in shock because I've never heard you talk about dieting before! ha ha You gotsda send me dubs of the NYC photos, OK? Did Momma send you mine from Hughes Street? Have you, or anyone else, picked up Jason Mraz yet? Greggy and I went to the show last night in Raliegh, North Carolina (where Megan Dahhling is from) in this quaint club called Disco Rodeo. It was awesome! We had second row (all standing--general admission) but there was some eye sex going on with us...oh yeah. Greg and I were feeling a little old as most of the kids looked between 16 and 21. If you like Ryan Adams, I swear you'll like this guy...he's got a cool, laid-back, jazziness---a mighty fine voice. Oh and I even want a double of the toilet with no door...as I was the drunk girl using it unaware that there was another one WITH a door intended for the ladies of the HOLE, as unsuspecting male hole-diggers turned the corner ready to piss in the corner but really got a good look at my ass. thank God for alcohol...

      ERIN!!! Soup diets are for retards... don't you see that?  You are not a retard so get off the stupid soup diet.  All a soup diet does is make you unhappy.  You are always hungry (thus unhappy),  have no energy (thus unhappy), and you loose weight at such an underwhelming pace that you think you aren't loosing weight (thus making you unhappy) and then you get unhappy cuz' you realize that you are so unhappy all the time and the stupid diet isn't working anyway and what a fucking waste of time.  And what if you do happen to loose a few kilos??? You start eating again and re-gain the weight really quickly because your body is still the unremarkable food processor it always was, and it will always be unless you start to excercise.   And by the way Erin, excercise is not a slow walk around Hyde Park with Bec and a beer once a week.  You don't need to starve yourself to be happy, just eat a little different and except that you don't really look bad at all.  Food for thought (no pun intended).  Nuff said

      So this is why the streets of ML are so silent that I can almost hear the clanking of an old lady's zimmer frame in Glen Iris.... everybody's stuck behind a computer bloggin!! yay! I gots to get my internet reconnected! Yes Gardiner I do manage to bullshit my way into these things, I realised I hadn't checked my email for a while and there was this letter from another guy who wants me to dj............. hmmm this is getting rather odd, but apparently I'm starting this friday, it better not be regular cos I wanna get in on Denim (80s night)... ahh my dream. Anna: I have absolutely no idea what that song at the Hole was but I do know that I just got my photos back of you busting a move to it and of the toilets with no door....aw. Noni, have you completely forgotten about my position in the future Diva-empire? I'm drawing up plans for my strap on decks as we speak.... perhaps you could record your lines and I'll walk behind you addin a beat to em, scratchin em up and shit. yeeeah. Furze props to whoever came up with 'The Sharp II' as long as you do a cover of 'Skivvies are back' .... but I am thinking of another ingenious little name as a backup.... WHICH REMINDS ME: somebody think of a dj name for me (besides dj Callahan (inspired by police academy big tits officer) Noni!) so far "Sham" seems the most appropriate but c'mon, you're all creative people apparently................  And why has Cockface become some kind of honorary WAAPA member!? he goes to more WAAPA functions than me! And I actaully went there! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....cock....face....  Curse this soup diet! I'm so hungry I could eat my own ear-wax, and we all know how horrid that tastes! right kids? stay gold ponyboy, I'm outty.

      GOD DAMNED PERFORMANCE ARTISTS... I prefer homeless people lying in their own filth asking me for money... Last year on a current affairs show, there was a story about a guy who was awarded a thirty thousand (yes thirty thousand) dollar grant to develop a performance art piece.  Nine months later at his premiere (is that what you call a street performers opening gig???) he showed up with 6 or seven buckets (admittedly they were all different colours) and drank some shit (not actual shit) to induce vomiting, and proceeded to vomit in some of the buckets (not all of them tho, is that supposed to be fucking artsy and significant or something?? Who fucking cares anyway right?)... He then did the most retarded dance in the middle of the circle of buckets and then drank the vomit he had so fervently induced and revomited (was that even a word before this guy tried to enliven' world art with his stupid buckets?) his spew into the remaining buckets...  nine months and thirty thousand dollars = seven buckets a spastic jig and some spew.    And you know what else?? I suspect that this artist (wanker) was also probably bludging on the dole whilst wasting our thirty grand on his pathetic buckets.  World War II might have been a success if Hitler had targeted performance artists.   hmmm...Nuff said about that i think.  I just watched "GOOD FELLAS" again for the first time in years... a genuinely great movie that has withstood a decade (or more?) better than my mother.  I miss the days when scorsese could do no wrong.  oh yeah ANDREW, Dave Thrussel was originally gonna call his band "Hitlers Other Testicle" instead of SNOG so use that bit of info as you will.  I think "SOMETHING TO DO WITH PROZAC" is a great name for a band.

      so it's sunday. and i have managed to wake up without feeling like i am dead for the first sunday in quite a while. think i will put it down to constant drinking of fine spirits rather than chopping and changing between the old carlton/ swan draft and $6 chards as i usually do. yay hangover appears to have passed me by.   was it opening night of "the party" last night? is that what induced the drunken messages at random times of the morning? note to noni: what part of your mind suggested that driving with cockface would be either a. enjoyable, b. safe c. not an experience that would make you want to hurl your body out the moving vehicles window? ps didnt know you had changed number sorry thought it would be you though. well it's a bit of a nice perth day today, think i might step away from the computar and enjoy it.

      Ok kiddies, I'm trucking into Perth on Friday 5th of September, but I'm only visiting you guys overnight cos unfortunetly I fly out Sat evening. The good news is that I'll be back again on the 4th of October for four days of fun filled madness. Basically it's a paid junket because we're only there to do the telethon which means I can be as hungover as hell at any given time and no one's going to give rat's arse, least of all me! And they're paying me to go... so sweet.  Anyone wanna name my new band? Special supa-dupa prize if one of you suggests a good name and I use it... Currently the names we've thrown up are -  - Jesus and the Josephs - The mouldy cheese experience - Hitler's Testicle - Grand auto funk railroad car - Donkey Splat - BloodGore - The pansies - Andy and the Knob Cheese - The Sharp II - The-artist-formerly-known-as-Furzey-who-was-in-that-band-called-girlfriday-but-is-now-pissing-about-with-some-other-schlepps.

      Shayne, I'm so fucking glad you've made the decision never to work with music theatre.  In spite of the fact that in little over a year I will be expected to call myself an Actor, I hope I'll be a lazy one, bordering on crap, so no one has to put up with my wanky bullshit (except Erin, who'll help me learn lines as she is, well, doing lines). And Furze, you ain't seen bad street theatre yet.  Do you know that they teach that shit at WAAPA!?  Three words: Theatre Fucking Arts.   They can 'eat their own dump' (quote courtesy of this week's birthday girl - The Han)

      Furze can i say how pleased i am to have found a pal in life with a passionate hatred for "Street Theatre." it is by far the lowest form of performance, it is degrading to other performers, JLH excluded, to call themselves performers. whats with diving head first into a swimming pool of gold paint sticking some ivy on your head and claiming to be something to do with a greek goddess? going up to random strangers and not letting them pass til they chuck a dollar in your oliver twist hat is called harrassment. they should turn that scenario into an episode of blue heelers, it would be about as believable as the rest of their storylines. think that ends my gripes on street theatre, thanks for the birthday wishes, had a pretty good one - involved much delicious food and much even yummier alcohol, so cheers i'm 22.

The other day Blogger-shmogger unceremoniously dumped this 4 page rant on Australian I dol and why it is anabsolute crock of shite. once a rant like that dissapears you can never re-create it. writers among us know what I'm talking about.   Ditto on the actor front.  TOP 5 worst actors/performances  - Local theatre actors whose sense of self - importance while putting a tired rendition of "As you like it" single handedly surpasses 20 years of Cancer research. - JLH (Jennifer Love Hewitt for those lucky enough to have escaped her pouting/"acting") - Street THeatre actors, esp those who mime walk against the wind. How about you walk through some plate glass and get outta my way. - The dwarf in "Passions". He's actually really good, I just have this pathalogical fear of dwarves... - Kylie Minouge in "street fighter". Well ok, maybe she was let down by the script...

Its like 11mins or some shit.... i love it i love it i love it, gold gold gold (CB4 quote)  Oh and Anna, aint nobody gotta request Livin on a Prayer you know I be playin dat shit every night. Hmmm so its Wednesday, I hope a few Perthonalities will be heading down to my possible future job location the Scotty tonight, cmon, its the big Spannah-Etho's B'Day, plus y'all know ya wanna hang out with me! I watched Human Nature last night (the movie, not 'little-man-big-hair', I had enough of watching them after the MJ gig in '97 "Patrons with the registration "H-NATURE" please leave the arena") I guess it was pretty good, in fact it was very good but unfortunately not what I expected as all the hilarious bits were on the preview...

      Ok my little arteeeest! Make sure you go ahead and do the f%$ing DJ gig and don't back out. I'll kick your arse if you do! You already know you can do it well, you just gotta get your head around the equipment, and I can help you with that. You're in a great position really. Melbourne is looked apon as the Rock capital of Australia and all things cool and rock are assumed to emanate from Melbourne, like the Vines, and you. Just like all things dance are meant to emanate from Sydney. So all you have to do is turn up and do the gig and they'll pay you more (because you have experience and are from melbourne dude...) and when you run out of songs you can go as obscure as possible. No one will question you because they'll assume that despite having no idea what you're playing, they really SHOULD know what you're playing (cos you're cutting edge and, like, from melbourne dude).  And if you play some schlocky cheese like aerosmith or Bon Jovi they'll assume you're being ironic and cool. And if you play "the Cure" too much and they question you, just reply that it's the winter solstice of your discontent and raise one eyebrow...no worries.   And if you get requests for bands that you've never heard of remark that you love their shit but can't fit them in tonight cos you've got a two hour interpol tribute show on tonight.   And don't engage in sex behind the booth because it's really unfulfilling due to having to start and finish within a 3 and 1/2 minute song before you change the record. If you get really randy I personally recommend: - Sweet Child O mine (6min) - Bohemian Rhapsody (6.45) - Paranoid by Sabbath (7.1 in full version) - Closer, 9 inch nails (6 min and it's good rooting music)  Besides, who else is gonna pay $50 an hour to drink and play records eh?   P.S I'm in perth Friday 5th and Saturday 6th Sept. Start planning my demise...

And Furze - that is my arteeeeest name and it is not amusing. it is arteeeestic.

      well, ok it was a bit tough picking on ezla's little-used real name. You didn't choose it, and it could have been much worse. You could have rechristened yourself "suzani summer rain"...

      I'm pleased to report that Anna has a blog, I've started a revolution (actually that's a damn good site name, why didn't I think of that? oh wait, I just did) Anyway, HER blog site is  urlLink Under the Table  (also listed in the links)  Andrew, bringing intelligence back to the blog, I like your style, although I'm completely issued out after watching the entire second series of The Awful Truth last night..... ahhh had to replay that footage of Keyes jumping into the portable moshpit so many times... hilarious.  Anyways, better order some sushi before they kick me out...Tan Popo, you're so good to me  rock.

      Sorry guys, news flash!! Apparently gay marriages are threatening the survival of the species. I wasn't previously aware that the human species was in direct danger of dying out, but our Prime Minister has assured me that we are, and that Gay marriages are to blame. This is an immense relief to myself as I'd been previously fretting that the world was becoming a mite overcrowded in places and that, possibly, billions of humans were using up natural resources quicker than they could replenish, destroying rainforests, creating deserts and causing the extinction of a multitude of other species. I was also a teensy bit concerned that the 6 billion humans crawling all over God's earth were creating quite a bit of pollution, destroying the ozone layer, melting the polar ice caps and polluting the oceans. Apparently I was foolish to be kept up all night because, contrary to my own misconceptions, humans are in serious danger of extinction themselves due to the mass pervadance (is that a word guy?) of gay marriages.  I guess I thought that it was possible that our own kind might one day go the way of the dodo, but I was convinced that it would more likely be caused by war (35 million dead since WWII, 90% civilians), disease (50,000 in Rwanda alone since the crisis in the 80's) or an asteroid about to collide with the earth where our only hope of survival is to send an off-shore drilling team into the asteroid to plant a nuclear bomb blowing it smithereens, only complicated by the fact that the mission leaders daughter is in love with one of the crew members and is torn between loyalties in a touching story about good, evil, human endeavour, asteroids, the breeding abilities of starbucks stores and how it all is somehow tied to the collapse of the asian economy... sorry did I get sidetracked?  Anyways I guess I thought you should all know that you can sleep well at nights knowing that the ills of the world and mankind's possible failure to exist are the lone fault of a small minority of the poulation - homosexuals, who, now thanks to prime ministerial decree, you can safely pillorise, demonize, antagonize and generally discriminate against at will. Isn't that great?

       Cheesy Music Theatre Song of the Week:   I Could Have Danced All Night   This classic standard from My Fair Lady (by Frederick Loewe) describes the vulger Eliza Dolittle's elation at becoming, well not so vulgar.  Tomorrow, I shall repeat these words in a meeting with Jenny Lyndd (why does she need two D's?  Its greedy and unnecessary).  But I will not be describing my elation, but rather, the amount of dancing I could do and  still be shit.  How can it be that one can disappoint so often and to such a large extent, when apparently one lowered everybody's expectations to the  most pathetic standards  such a long time ago?

       I AM A DEMON AND I LOVE ROCK N ROLL!!!   sorry about that outburst, but I really do love rock n roll, I love it so much its like some kind of drug that  I had to leave scotties early last night just to get a hit when i got back to my bedroom where it was safe to jump around wildly, headbang my brains out and callapse with the comfort of a 'cheeky' G&T (thanks Han).  Anna : Scotties is 'The Flying Scotsman' pub on Beaufort St, where there's the endless pleasure of $8 jugs o' beer, cool kids, and fun times. ..... well usually fun times..... well used to be fun times, I'm in agreeance Shayne, it is over-crowded and generally evil, but the music does kinda rock my world and its warmer than my house.... so weighing up the situation I think I'll be renewing my membership of every wednesday without fail. ARE YOU IN? OR ARE YOU OUT? Gotta say, its cool to be on the westside again, even though its a little like the wizard of oz, like I went to some crazy land, woke up and no time had past, but I'm slowly realising that shit has gone down, in fact its a little eery around here, like some kinda ghost-town, nobody on the streets, well, at least nobody on the porch.... like everyone's disapeared into another zone (something called 'uni' or 'work'?????) oh well, back to the good ol' life soakin up the W.A lifestyle in the 2 months that I still can! rock out.  ps- anna I tried to call you like 8 million times and i kept getting  'we regret that there is currently congestion in the overseas network'  i wasn't happy:( .... and i aint got no photos yet but am tres looking forward to it     I'd just like to point out that I'm blogging from TAN POPO ... hilarious

      Hi Erin and everyone else! :) {I wish I could've met you all while I was in Perth...or Melbourne.} Where's Scotties? Anyway, Errie--you didn't ring me before you left home! This is your brain---this is your brain on drugs. ha ha I'm actually writing (and yes, I have a point) to tell you that I got the job directing the elementary music programs for two of our elementary schools! :) I'm really excited! When I finish in January, I'm planning to try London again and if it's not time for that, I'll just get a visa and move to Melbourne for a little while...stay with Lynda and Greg in East Malvern ;) surf my heart out and hang with Bunnie! Sound like a plan Stan? Who knows where the hell I'll be next...Hey, have you received the photos I sent you? I sent you my doubles from New York...there's a cute one of you, Greg, and I in front of RENT. Oh, and I sent them to your parents'...hope you got it before you left. Love you!

      Nice work etherington, or should i say blatherington... So yeah Buntines finally comin home, after wreaking havoc over the globe.  I gotta say to everyone though that I don't know if scotties (bless its bar and beer) is really that cool anymore. I mean it's really has turned into some kind of communal uterus and crossing the room is kind of a kin to being born, that is tight and difficult.  In spite of this though it's hard to see any other pub ever taking its place. i mean It's only a short walk to porch fun, usually filled to the brim with beautiful people (who really wants to be surrounded by uglies??) and the back rooms tunes are at worst innoffensive and actually often amazing.  So peoples of perth, when the magic buntine magnetism is compelling us all toward drunkeness and debauchery where will we be???  At scotties of course... cuz thats were she will be.  nuff said

      think with erin's return to the west siiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeede tonight, i may also find myself slowly returning to the world of the porch, the scotman, those cheap jugs - been so long since i been i cant remember how cheap is cheap, but do remember the quality drunkeness those cheap jugs produce. Things here need a rattlesnake in the grass, check out the quietness of the blog for starters, think that you buntine might be the girl to put a bit of bop back in bee-bop. if anyone can understand the sentence i just wrote you are more clued in than me, my worst fears of having a brain that is out-of-service seem to be coming a reality.

      Well I guess today is one of those days where I stare blankly at the blogger posting page, (furze its happened already). I'm in a moping mood, the gradual realisation that I've met the love of my life is slowly sinking in.... and yes there is the possibility that he is reading this, but I don't mind, cos I basically already admitted it in email form, I got nothin to lose, he's on his way to the other side of the world as I speak. So thats the news on this end, Catching a plane to the west-sieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeede tonight, bloody fantastic, somebody buy the tonic cos I'm bringing the GIN!!!! gonna go make me some pasta.......are ya achin? yum yum yum yum for some bacon? yum yum yum....  apologies for the lack of subject matter, wit, or general content of interest in this post.

      Damn you furze, publishing my deshevellment and slightly less glamourous side... at least the upside to your lack of illicit drugs is that you may still feel like you have a few brain cells... i have an overwelmingly numb mind right now.... i can almost feel any level of intelligence slowly seeping out. But hey, its worth it, I had a taste of completely undeserved fame for a few nights, I've felt important and envied and now i never ever want to feel it ever again! No wonder rock stars are such assholes to the general public, they possibly see the most terrifying side of humanity all the freaking time, this hideous stream of desperation that seems to ooz from their pores to be 'in on the scene' just makes you either want to purchase an animal tranquiliser  or  a mountain of cocaine to rid yourself of it. Lucky the latter is more common. So my floating cloud is slowly coming down.... actually it came down like a tonne of bricks when i basically went from an expensive hotel to my brothers apartment to sit around and endure his friends drinking cheap beer and watching football, didn't quite have the glamour of nights past, but hey that's fine with me, i think i actually appreciate my life a little more now, sure i'm a bogan alcoholic who does nothing all day but apply for outragous jobs that i'm not qualified for to get the dole and my house is apparently infested with mice, but at least i'm not past out in a hotel in my own vomit and rolling around in a cocaine/drunken spasm every single night not knowing what city i'm in..... its actually quite comforting.

      can anyone imagine a more rock scene than this. Saturday, around midday.  dishevelled girl with wild black hair and wearing an "interpol" tshirt and fish-nets staggers out of swanky hotel apartments on Flinders Lane, clutching a slab of beer and half a bottle of gin. Stumbles into waiting tarago and dissappears.   Just finished three day bender with Buntine and i'd be lying if i said it hadn't taken it's toll. the only thing harder on the liver then being a groupie is being a friend of a groupie who doesn't have such easy access to mountains of illicit drugs... THink I've reached the zenith of personal abuse because I can't remember a sobre day in the last two weeks. But it really aint my fault. blame all the people who pay me to drink each week (and occasionally strum a guitar). Feel like I'm trapped in "leaving Los Vegas" or maybe even "fear and loathing in los vegas". Definetly trapped inside some movie with "los vegas" in the title and a penchant for substance abuse.  that's it. It is definetly detox time. It can only help that Erin is going home on Tuesday. As much as I want her to stay it seems that as soon as I am in her vicinity bottles of gin start appearing and dissapearing down my throat.  Back to bed...

      The Blog ain't dead y'all, its just havin a breather.  It seems like phone disconnection has been the 'in' thing to do in the west so leaving the house to jump on the net is something of a hassle.  I know that having to walk all that way from my place to the mega-lab is certainly a struggle after a long day of cheesy and generalised performance training.  There's no mention of how the Interpol concert/party went so I assume Erin, that you have spontaneously combusted or are wandering Melbs looking for your breasts after they flew out of your top in a fit of hysteria. The parental units arrive today, I'm trying very unsuccessfully to get the smell of sin/pub/trash (that Clinton The Inconsiderate Arsehole left behind) out of my house before they get here and ask all sorts of questions like- "Noni, why does your bedroom smell like smoke and why is there an ashtray next to your bed?".  Buntine, hurry up and give us the goss on the 'Pol...

      I would definitely go work in NYC if I had someone to go with! They offered me the job too last notice...I'd have to leave in like a week! And besides, then I couldn't go to London if the job opens up in January. I'm currently applying for a long-term sub position where my youngest sisters go to school. I'd be directing the elementary music programs there and at another elementary school. I'd even be conducting the Christmas/Holiday performances! I'm really excited about it and should know soon if it's a go. I'd be there October-January. :) Aaaah, Perth...I miss it so much! Our days at the Brass Monkey for beers and then crossing to Connections---is that spelled with an "X"? Catchya later gator!

      Hey Errie... Sorry to hear you are having it rough back at home. :) When do you leave for Perthy-pooh? I'm flying back down to see Greggy in a couple of weeks. We are going to see Jason Mraz 8/24 and Tori Amos/Ben Folds 8/30. I couldn't take it. All of my California friends went to like 7 Tori concerts this week in CA, Las Vegas, and Arizona. They were sweet and left me lots of songs on my cell voice mail. So I broke down and was like, I HAVE TO SEE AT LEAST ONE SHOW! So greggy wants to go with me...yeah I'm running out of money, yeah I don't have a job, but you only live once baby. How did DJing go? Is DJing a word? I hope you can ring me soon...make sure you do it before you leave for perth because then I KNOW I won't be hearing from you! ha ha :) Miss you madly! PS--> what month are you going back to Melbie? I'm trying to get my life in order...

I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAggh its driving me crazy, as expected, but the fact that I'll be moving back here kinda permanently in a few months is reeeally depressing. Can't handle. Gonna have to find myself a shit load of money immediately... any ideas?  Prostitution is looking really good right now.   I'm serious.  Anyways back to moping around in tracksuit pants and leaving a generally disgusting mess around the house as amunition to fight with my mother about whoo-hoo! fun fun fun

      Howdy Y'all.  I began to realize the year really is almost over last night when I successfully lied my arse off to get a first year to take over my lease of the Crap-Shack.  Whilst overjoyed at the money I'll save on holiday rent, my bottom lip is all a-quiver when I think of all the fun times that won't be had there next year with the des crew.  Of course I could think of all the fun times we did have there but they're all pretty fuzzy and I'm not sure if that was my life or the minutes of the Mt Lawley AA Meeting.  How forlorn I feel. However, its not like my life is without love and happiness.  Afterall, there is nothing better than receiving 3 birthday cards ALL WITH YOUR FACE ON THE STAMP.  I had hoped this wouldn't happen till I was an international celebrity, but no, my mum had to do it.  MUM! BACK OFF! You just... love me... too much.  Thankgod she wasn't within touching distance, with all that honesty around, coulda been too much, might not get anything on Saturday.

      Now for the super-brief write up of the mass house party of friday night... Ingredients: 170 party-people party pies pizza alcohol tarps flooding the yard storms Dj denise bringin' it all in all, a fabulous night, only 4 gate-crashers, let them hang around and graffiti the weekly cleaning roster, they made ammendments like: "The vacuum cleaner is called Boris, Boris likes sprog.." etc (PS they were 16)  Next scheduled mega party is February, and yes ANDREW you will be invited, I just assumed you were far too well known and famous to poke your head into a party based in a suburban house in Camberwell....Hope all you bloggers can come to Melbourne end of next feb to party it up...til then, mama Laurie is signing off!  PS, I just watched JLo's movie, 'Enough', and am pleasantly surprised by its quality, I especially like the scenes where she is training to kick her ex-husbands ass....hilarious.

I for one had a pretty tops night, dressed as a primary school slut, let me just say that 'sleaze ball' is not just a clever name, with an unprecidented amount of sleazy random old guys present purely because they think its some kind of fantasy strip club, i had my ass grabbed more last night than I've had hot dinners ... but you get that.  and how the hell does laurie know 200 people?

      Bloody good idea Shayne. but all this talk about the end of an era is bringing a little sting to the corners of my eyes. mostly because i know its true and as the days get longer and summer dawns on our state the number of bloggers and porch goers from this western side are going to diminish slowly into oblivion. til one day someone will blog and say "remember that night that shayne got really hammered and roast chickened sturge, for something new, and smashed his head?" so documenting these moments on film is a damn good call, yeah.

      I'm thinking that before the porch ends, i might shoot a short (maybe 3-6 minutes) film documenting the period for everyone. Not a crappy home movie, but a real underground 8mm film.   Each night that I'm there I might use a three minute reel, and after building up a collection of these i will edit it into a masterpiece of lethargy and beer, all in grainy 8mm goodness.  Buntine, perhaps you could burn a bunch o tunes onto a cd that I could add in post. I'm thinking genuine porch stuff, that will make us cry with nostalgia in years to come.  Snacky, you have to do your dance for me front of the camera.  Methinks this would be a fitting way to see out the end of an era.  thoughts anyone??

Posting on this blogg means you have to...  - divulge details from your most debauched sexual encounters  - whinge about the people in your life that shit you - Exessively punctuation esp. !!! and F%^$ck  - swap New York travel details - Pine after members of bands originating from same place as above - Quote lyrics from bizarrely obscure musicals - intensely like or dislike pop - review music, cinema, books etc from a highly judgmental and pretentious pulpit - Create highly entertaining lists of random things that may or may not mean anything to anyone - Share adventures that paint you in a less-than-favourable light - share the general tragedy and joy in your life with a bunch of beautiful people stretched from one end of the country to the other.  got it?

      he he he i just noticed in the 'fresh blogs' section there was one called 'dip your beak...often' ... that's fantastic.  This is so wierd I was just thinking about top 5s today and getting all High Fidelity and then read this... strange... ok I was actually thinking of my top 5 movie soundtracks and find it impossble to list them in order but I'm throwing 5 out there  1.  Sliver - actually a fucking awesome soundtrack  (if you exclude the random shaggy and ub40) but has a lot o greats including massive attack, neneh cherry, verve etc  2.  Trainspotting - obviously brilliant, and in recent weeks i've discovered its great to go walking/jogging to (you heard right) only because i can pretend i'm in a scene delivering drugs or somethin  3.  Nowhere - I don't think I've actually even seen this film (although it looks ultra cool) stumbled accross the album the other day.. elastica, james, chem bros, radiohead  4.  charlies angels I - if good for nothing else but dancing around my bedroom with bec after the scotsman  5.  Reality Bites - Gotta be in there for road trip fun ... i bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste...i know you're lovin this Han  Top 5 films is a hardy, and yes shayne that list was pretentious but not without cred... in fact that's probably why it was so pretentious but I'll make my honest top 5 1. The Hours 2. Basquiat 3. Loaded Weapon 1 4. Dirty Dancing 5. Naked  just realised how random those choices are but i'm under pressure to get it all out before my computer shuts down later

      Actually, while we are on the subject of top fives, I would like to lean "Maybe I'll Go Blind" away from music (which is the most oft talked about thing on this blog) for a moment to focus on film.    I want the top 5 films (I know this is hard, well it is for me anyway) listed for each blogger. So here's mine (may not actually be the same tomorrow, and was probably different yesterday.) Though not specifically in this order.  1. Ed Wood 2. Magnolia 3. Lost Highway 4. Le Samurai 5. Spirited Away  Hmmm... Buntine it occurs to me you would call this list pretentious, and to be honest I would have to agree with you. SO here is an unpretentious top 5.  1. The Goonies 2. Batman/The Hulk (you try and pick between these two) 3. Raiders of the Lost Ark 4. Reservoir Dogs 5. The Muppet Movie  so there, everyone has lots o lists to make here now, so get bloggin'.

      Okay, here is my random top five...  1. re-runs of Futurama, now here is a cool show that falls way left of centre without ever becoming genuinely fringe.   2. Personal Health/Fitness, even though I don't currently have any, i'm really looking forward to getting buff for summer!  3. Health Care Cards, Another thing that i don't have but would desperately love to have. I got my Fees invoice for WAAPA this week and it's like twice as much as it was when i had a health care card.   4. Batman, Nuff said!  5. The mint condition 1998 Portishead tour poster I just won at auction on ebay.  I was there... along with the ambulance crews that seemed to constantly adminsterinng shots of narcan to the hordes of smack addicts that kept going over.   6. Johnny Depps once in a career performance as the charming pirate Jack Sparrow in the movie based on the ride at Disneyland. Isn't it amazing that such cool stuff can grow out of shit some times. (okay I know it's a top five, but couldn't possibly not include this)  seeya

      Hannah, thank you so much for my official acceptance as des crew.  Would it still be ok if i remain as a performer to the MT staff and various other industry personalities likely to get me a job?  Erin, I think we all know that the Scottie was crap because I wasn't there.  Furze, I don't know about pidgeon, I still maintain chicken.  But here's my random top 5... 1. Having a week off from uni and actually feeling like I deserve it. 2. Sleazeball, the one night in the year when people don't notice how sleazy I am ordinarily. 3. The Crap Shack (my house) and how cool it is when its clean. 4. GMHBA giving me a lot of money for old bills I found whilst cleaning said crap shack. 5. Second wind of invincibility.  Of course it would occur in the holidays.  P.S.  Furze, agreeable boys are very nice to go out with.  Do be careful what you agree on though, xanadu, the new suede pumps you wanted, emmanuel... you don't want to project anything that opposes the purposes of your date.

      Right that's it. I do NOT have a pigeon head! I may have a small tendency to bob my head in time with the DAT tape but that does NOT mean you guys can make favourable comparisons between me and any type of bird-life. I'm really insulted now and I'm going to sulk for a bit...  ...  ...  ... alright I'm fine now. Anyway time for everyone here to post something. Need everyone's "Random Top 5".  I'm throwing this one open to the entire "might go blind" panel. Here's mine  1. The Led Zep DVD - The sound of my jaw hitting the floor after watching 8 hours of sheer pure genius 2. Fleetwood Mac touring - considering getting the $400 "meet and greet" tickets. I currently have too much money. 3. Melbourne getting over 20 degrees. I'm primed to expose my white flabby body to the world. 4. Reading the Hearld-Scum and working up a big bout of self-rightousness about..well...everything. 5. Those rare and amazing nights when you drink Jaagermeister till 4am and by some miracle wake up without a hangover.  P.S I'm single now and I actually went on a date on the weekend. First time in over 4 years and it was very weird. Anyone here got any insights as to how the female mind works? Any helpful answers will win a signed emmanuel CD so your drinks no longer have to stain the coffee table either...

      Yes Katie I feel your pain, I too get these retarded requests, guys are the worst "hey hey um, if i request something will you actually play it?" me: "depends what it is", them "ok its like a kind of new song, its by that black guy and it goes like (singing badly) girl.... you got ... somethin" aaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh, at least your patrons aren't wasted, and making you feel like its the least you could do to play their shit song.  I've said it before but single 25-35 year olds are my most hated demographic, I realise this is a gross generalisation but you know the kind I'm talking about, the kind that love the song 'smooth' by santana and the dude from matchbox 20 followed by 'sexbomb' by tom jones, and think they're hip  and  alternative by buying 'rush of blood to the head' and only playing the single 'clocks'. They make me wanna grab a machine gun from behind the desk and splatter their blood all over their baby pink mini-tops and tight white pants.  As you might've guess, i just got home from work. I'll be back when I'm in a better mood. later.

      Thanks Buntine, I'm wrapped with my new vocation!!! I am now officially a CD Adviser, "Cd Adviser to the front desk please", "Hi how can I help you", "um yeah I'm looking for that song, you know the one, it has that guitar in it and I think a girl sings it" "um okay a little more info, what is the chorus like" "um I dunno but I saw the film clip on TV Hits and they are on a roof and there is some pidgen headed giutarist who has spikey hair" "OOOHHH right I think your looking for Shhmanuel Carella"....  BY the way I think this could be the biggest news of the year in regards to my love of bands.... FLEETWOOD MAC AND PRINCE!!!!!!!!!!! I'm shaking in my boots people... Stevie my Goddess, and Prince you funky ass mother fucker! Bring it on I say, now I wait in anticipation for David (I love you in Lycra body suits) Bowie to bring on the greatest hits tour....  Ahhh finally Australians get some decent acts.

      Ok. You might have never thought this would happen, but I think I'm over the scotsman, I wouldn't go so far as to say "I'm the mayor of Over-it city" but I'm quite up there. I think this has something to do with how many people I'm trying to avoid there (the number has somehow trippled in the past few weeks). I dunno, I might just be in a wierd mood this Wednesday, as it is my least favourite date of the year today and I'm listening to wierd/bland/progressive/reflective Suzanne Vega ( we go to the playground in the winter-time, the sun is fading fast upon the slides into the past, upon the swings of indecision...)   .... hmmm lame symbolism.  Anyways, yes I think I need to get drunk... mmm mini-Gin memories of London.  I'd just like to throw a little somethin out there before I go:  CONGRATS TO KATHERINE LOUISE GARDINER ON FINALLY SCORING A JOB AT JB HIFI  it had to happen sooner or later

      ah shayne never thought i'd see the day when WAAPA would stress you out at all, let alone so much that you got an ulcer from it. Didnt think you'd be able to muster up enough of a care factor for the place to be able to get stressed from it. hope you have adopted the big kraso school of wearing train driver caps, unwashed tracksuits and growing a mullet all in the name of being to stressed out to maintain personal appearances.    And ditto to the let's get drunk call, although can it be somewhere that isnt the scotsman, for reasons i dont think i have to explain. you know a change is as good as a holiday and all that shit. but speaking of which it will have to be after this weekend as i am heading to the east coast tomorrow, to the city the other half of this blog is more familiar with. i'll be in the land of melbs.  in other news just thought i'd let everyone who laughed at my story about falling on my arse know that this week has proved accident free. i'll prioritise some serious fool-making behaviour in the next few days to keep the giggles going.

      Yeah I'm back. It's hump day (as my suspiscious grade 4 teacher always called it with a slight moan) and that means - half the week has gone and I haven't done any work, its pub night and I can get trashed... but I have to sing tomorrow.   What happened to my invincibility?  There was once a time, and I'm sure the blog has archival record of it, when I could drink, smoke, scream every night away and still be in near perfect form the next day (I only say near perfect because, well, you've gotta have something to aim for).  If my invincibility has deteriorated in such a short time to 'normal' does this mean in another 6 months of steady decline I could be reduced to one of those people who won't drink 2 weeks before a performance, or use spray deoderants, or go into smoky venues, or laugh heartily, or even LOOK at weed for fear of damaging my voice - and then still be crap!!!???  I couldn't bare it, I strongly dislike those people.  I need a second wind...  And Furze, great to see you chicken-heading on Rove.  Although I think your air-time is being affected by your apparent need to make love to that mic.  Cheesy MT Song of the Week:  Bali Ha'i    From the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein show, South Pacific, the song was the first in film history to use several colour filters in the one scene.  Have fun Leon.

      WAAPA is killing me... My show is causing me so  much stress right now I think I'm getting a stomach ulcer.    Furze, I didn't think you soft... In fact as i see it, sleep is a great form of avoidance and denial and given that you were in the bowells of a never ending coporate music store o death tour I probably would have been sleeping to.  Erin I need to get drunk with you real soon.  Hannah, same with you.  Noni were are you? You aren't in my life enough (at all) these days.  Panda, you're standing right next to me... (hi to everyone on blog from Panda!!)  I watched CHICAGO last night, I haven't seen it before... It was kinda cool. slick even. But Richard Gere sounded like a one of the 4th grade geeks from the simpsons. I can't believe he is or ever was a sex symbol.  oh yeah, I also watched THE HULK again, I think it is the most interesting comic book film ever made. Even if not the coolest. Ang Lee can do no wrong.  Christian Bale is gonna play BATMAN, this is possibly the most mouth watering comic book geek news ever.  So yeah I think I'm starting to disassociate right now.  SO I better get back to the pain that is WAAPA before i slip into self induced narcolepsy  Bye for now...

      Just a little story... okay, so a few days ago, Friday to be exact, I was running along a country road with my male Siberian Husky, Nikki. It is a beautiful day...blue sky, sunny with white fluffly clouds, green fields and grasshoppers everywhere. We are cruising along about a mile and half from my house--halfway home, Byonce just comes on my headphones and is telling me about her crazy love, when out of NOWHERE comes this vicious little brown poodle thing. I look back for a second before it attacks and all I see are teeth and fur. (Like FIZGIG from The Dark Crystal) Before I know it, I'm on the road with dirt in my mouth. I get up quickly and turn to see my dog, still on his leash, still attached to my headphone holder belt, with the poodle in his mouth, shaking it from side to side like dogs do when you are playing with a rope or an old sock. I grab his collar and scream, "Drop it!" He does, the good boy, and the poodle dog is on her back. I see a red squirt of blood come out of her side as she lays there and whines like a bird. Then she gets up and crosses the road going back to the house from which she ran. She lays on her back with all four legs in the air. I'm thinking, "Oh my God, she's dead already." It is then that I realize I still have my headphones on, Byonce is still crazy in love, and I'm bleeding. I have a cut on my middle finger that is dripping red, my shoulder and leg have road rash and bleeding. Strangely, it made me feel young again. Don't get me wrong, I'm no masochist, but sometimes it feels good to get hurt. It makes me feel more alive somehow. And there's nothing like a skinned knee to return you to your childhood. So, an old man comes out from the house. I tell him what happened and apoligized. He said it wasn't my fault and "you just can't train a dog not to do that." He picks up the dog and takes it somewhere behind the house. I walk the dog back to the house and we wait in the driveway. An old lady comes out of the house. Despite the fact that I am visibly injured, she does not ask if I'm okay. I tell her what happened and she's only concerned with where her husband went. He comes around the house a moment later with the wet dog looking like a mexican sewer rat and says that he thinks she's going to be okay. I apologize again and continue my run home. My blood was dark and dried by the time I reached home, and my scratches were stinging from the sweat. I've recovered, however. My scratches are almost gone, but now have dark bruising underneath them. And my finger is almost healed as well. Moral of this story...don't get distracted by Byonce when running in the country...a poodle could catch you off guard!

      OK I is back. Sorry for the conyinued abscence but as Erin so elequently put, I was trapped is outer-suburban, pregnant teen mother, roving hoodlums, Westfield purgatory. 44 shopping centre in-store performances in 21 Days. Some people's idea of personal hell I'm sure. I never want to see another food-court as long as I live. Speaking of the glamorousrock star lifestyle, did anyone catch my stirling performance on Kerri-Anne yesterday morning? Yep, my star just keeps on rising. Everybody watch Bert next monday and the Footy show on thursday night for more Shmanueallli hot action lovin...  Jet album rocks, got a preview copy and it's actually a lot more diverse than I thought. They don't restrict themselves to ripping off the stones, they also do a bang-up job of ripping-off the beatles, AC/DC and Iggy Pop as well. Luck for them they do an excellent job of it. Yes BRMC are heading into dangerously over-hyped territory but fuck it, they're great and hopefully the album will be too. Got the launch party at Room this wednesday. Gardiner drag your arse down if you have an easy Thursday.  Also thanks so much to the combined Perthonalities for such a great night a few Friday's back. Haven't danced with so much disdain for my personal reputation for a very long time. I think we also invented a new concept that night in the club - Remote DJ-ing. It's this ritual wherein you keep requesting songs that are better than the ones the DJ was going to play himself. Except you do it by a system of note passing and you give the DJ so much love in return that he actually thinks he chose the songs himself. I think we completely programmed the music from 2am onwards from the dancefloor! Ratcat still rool Ok!   You guys should have seen the look on the face of the receptionist at the Duxton Hotel that night (morning) when I stumbled into the foyer at 5.30am with no luggage and slurred that I wanted to check in. Took me several attempts to convince him that I actually had a room before he gave me a key. Just how rock is that... I also feel like I need to prove my partying abilities to Shayne because I passed out at about 11pm, he left, then I performed a lazurus-style recovery to go hard for another six hours, but he didn't see that and probably thinks I'm the softest bloke he's ever met... next time my good man the tequila will be my friend.  Hannah that was a horrific story and I felt really bad about myself when I laughed continuously for two hours when I read it.   Peace out.   ALSO: Everybody check out this site http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Bleachers/2492/ and for god's sake sign the petition...

      Ah Han, The blog hasn't died, the case is more likely to be that your oh so graphic description of you publicly making a dick of yourself is a hard act to follow! Hmmm... that was Wednesday so I guess its about time we cranked this baby up again. Furze! where the hell are you? oh yeah probably trapped in a shopping centre in Bris-vegas.  My tips for the week:  Jet's new album  BRMC's new album (altho both of these bands are in danger of over hype virus) ... and gettin in early for Fleetwood Mac tix, god I love my mama a lot sometimes, that's right, I'll be Go[ing] [My] Own Way with a bunch o 50 year olds and lovin it.

      okay so being a hot shot floral designer/ installation artist/ event co-ordinator is not cool. think i should take out some form of medical insurance after yesterday. at the risk of making everyone at their computars piss their pants at my expense i will explain my hideous experience......  am delivering to a resturant on hay st, have parralell parked out the front, got out of car vase in hand full of water/ flowers/ rocks/ artistic sculptural elements not seen the curb as my face hidden behind masses of flower shit as explained above, so stacked it up the curb where i fall straight onto a bin, fall sideways where a light pole happens to be, graze my shoulder sliding down it, fall forward land on the pavement in smashed vase, water and shit on my knees. sound funny? i didnt think so. and to add insault to this hideous moment - no-one stopped to ask if i was okay - what fucking city are we living in, friendly little perth? i dont think so. some bitch even asked me later if i was okay because she had seen me fall outside her shop that morning. to bad if i wasnt okay. was it that hard to come out of her boutique womens wear shop and at least give me a hand up while sniggering quietly to herself???  anyway enough about me.

      Just checking back in. No, Erin, I haven't disowned you, and yes, I have been reading silently from my Indian brothel bedroom. Nothing much happening in Melbourne (which I think is what you assume). Congratulations to  Furze  for finally making it onto videohits. Rooftop settings for pop videos is TOTALLY ROCK so well done. Still don't understand why Emannuel has a record deal (or actually I think Furze told me). He just stands there and sings and that's it. And he looks like he should be behind the counter getting a CD signed at Chadstone, rather than the other way round. Don't understand! Congratulations on his number 14 chart debut.  Everyone should do the  Scientology personality test . I'm totally depressed, it claims. And neurotic, critical etc. etc. I want everyone's results published! Oh yeah, I don't think I've talked up Christina Aguilera yet...  Stripped  is really totally awesome. It's like a concept album allowing us to explore the mind of a skanky careerist pop star (which has to be a good thing). A "call to arms". And how hilarious does Lil'Kim look in the clip: randomnly in a bikini and Babooshka cloak in the middle of some sound-stage ghetto. Crazy.

      wazup, shayne I hope you're not offended by my slight outburst the other night, i was in a slightly emotional state as the rest of the blog reveals, I'd been up having a d&m with panda about my big move and suddenly felt a bit sorry for lil large. eh large... he does no wrong. anywho my interesting facts of the day: 1. I'm learning guitar... well not so much learning but sitting in front of the mirror air guitaring... except now i have an actual guitar to rest my arm on, it was getting a bit tiring without it.  2. there are 30 DJs in my company and 27 are boys...... he he he excellent, this job gets dreamier every day.  3. 67% of American welfare recipients are children... hmm.  end.

      Hmm shayne, I think its become apparent that you're observing L'arge's behaviour like some kind of seedy lurker hiding in the shadows of your own hallway and then reporting them to the world...literally. I believe that this Beth relationship may be purely an innocent friendship, maybe he just wants to break away from the regular crowd for a while.... i dunno, I'm not gonna comment any further.  Its suddenly dawned on me that I'll be leaving Perth in 2 months and not coming back. Like seriously not coming back, I shall no longer have a home here, and I'm not talkin no home like the summer of Piche but no obligation here at all, and I'll get to Melbourne and all my shit from my house here will be crammed into my bedroom there, and thats where i will live. And I won't be goin to Scotty on Wednesdays and Denim on Fridays and Ampies on Saturdays and I won't see any Perth peeps for like ages..... getting sad... gotta go.

      wow that was wierd, i just entered the goblind address (i did this three times, there were no mistakes) in my browser and got redirected to some christian reference website...  ...I think the moral right or maybe even the vatican is onto the goblind crowd, and they've set there hackers on some kind of digital crusade to subvert the heretics.    These holy crusades never work, they don't factor in the fact that beer, drugs and elitism are what make us think we are special.   So in the immortal words of Hunter S.

"I think I have used all my energy for the next ten years, the police helped me and Bec out of my garden at 5am. IT HURTS TO WRITE THIS..."  Oooohh, so trashy. You seem to be back in beautiful form.

      another sunday blog. rain came back to perth. why, isnt it spring where are the daffodils? just wanted to make small debreif style comment on friday evening, the merging of blog worlds, it was nice. thats a small comment. Pressume the insanity continued into the much hyped 80's night with the tunes blaring and the tequilla flowing. looking forward to your return the the west side furze for the highly acclaimed channel seven telethon, i applaud your continuing support for sick under-priveliged west australian children. (that is the main reason you are coming isnt it, and not for four days of waapa style binging?) and noni your attempt to get half a football team into your department reminded me of the annual charity evening when the Eagles dress up in drag and perform cabaret style re-enditions of "i love the night life" and abba favourites to clueless football members/ players who think it is both cool and unbelievably funny. in the hope of you graduating with a credential that is credible to people outside the MCG i suggest you stick to the traditional choice of raging queens. just a thought.  please also note, the above abuse of footballers is by no way a real representation of my view of the game erin if you were about to say that i was a one day a year band-wagon goer. thank you.

      Cheesy Music Theatre Song of the Day, no, Week, mmm nuh, Year (well certainly of my entire life anyway):  "Keep It Gay" from the new hit THE PRODUCERS, a Mel Brooks show that will be hitting good ol' Melbs next year.  The head of the MT Department (David "The King" King) has started recieving applications for potential 2004 freshman and whilst passing the bubble taps (or 'bubbler' for strange Perthonalities) happened to ask a few of us (ALL with curly hair I might add) if we would like to place our orders for next year.  Yes, yes we would.  In an ideal world, 9 ugly untalented girls (with undeniably straight lank and mousy hair) and 9 single boys with dashing looks, rippling muscles, hair of any clean variety and not a homosexual bone in their bodies all with an odd attractrion to trashbag (cuurly) redheads.  So basically, we're after some girls from the acting department (ooh, bitch) and half a team of footy players (preferably not the Sydney Swans).  David  just laughed, or made some gruff noise that we like to call the Marlboro,  shook his oversized bald head and said "Oh don't be silly, in all the two hundred boys that audition we only get 2 of them!  No no, think its best to keep them cute little raging queens." Ah yes, I am beginning to form a very precise picture of the rest of my life...

But who could really forget the Jane Fonda experience? :) And you know me---can't keep me OUTTA those cages! I can't believe I am the only "international star." I feel so honored! haha I gotta write you an email...good fucking shit! peace....

      mmmmmm neil's wet look lycra, there is almost nothing that beats that, except if you think of it in the context of his booty shorts, with matching mid-drift vest and knee high boot alla sleaze ball last year. i think the word we are looking for here is delicious.

      Ok, computer just shut down on me, I'm have deleted post trauma so I'm making this brief:  Tip of the week: get into W.A band  dyslexic fish , they're one of the greatest live acts I've ever seen and they do a show at least once a week and have just released an album. excellent.  Next, I'm profiling bloggers as there seems to be some confusion flying back and forth accross the land as to who the hell people are talkin to anyhow:   Perthonalities:    Shayne:  I met  Shayne in the early months of 2002 when he was a shit-kicker Stage Management Freshman on some crap-ass WAAPA show I was on, and the friendship really only started happening this year when this sudden clan o' Waapa crew became set in concrete. He has an extensive knowledge of films (every aspect of them) and mind altering substnces (again, every aspect of them) plus he's an all round intelligent, funny and tops bloke.   NoniDiva:  (Diva) hmmmmm what can I say, I spend almost every spare second with this girl, well every spare second that she has, as my life currently resembles the abode of vacancy. She famous before her time, does a killer Liza impersonation, is obsessed with Judy Garland and all things MT (music theatre), you'd think being a performer she'd be a little wary of what she does to her body, in fact she's my ultimate chain smoking, weed puffin, death bag drinkin buddy.   Hannah:  (Spannah, Etho, Han) We've been thru think and thin, at least as thin as Neil's wet look lycra, being in the same design class for three years and now she has to put up with me loitering around her floral design studio   Melbournians:    Andrew:  (Furze, Emmanual's lover) I met Furze when I was approx. 11 years old when he was my Bro's best friend, for a few years after that I only ever really saw him when he was wearing a red Coles tie or with guitar strapped around him in the music delight that was Girl Friday, you might have spotted him on such TV/Video appearances as Rove (doing drunken miming) GMA (although I didn't see it but I'm assuming more drunken miming), crawling on the sand porn-style in a GF clip and soon to be spotted on the television wonderland of W.A Telethon.... can't wait! (" I'll donate $20 if Emmanual's guitarist....")     Kate:  (Katherine, Katie G, Gardiner, Gards, Sula) The girl I spent every single day with from Grade 4 to Year 12, tops chick, excellent music appreciation, crazy lingo which we've co-developed over the years to the point where saying 'yo' or 'y'all' at the end of every sentance goes unnoticed   Lauren  (Laurie D, DDDude, Loz, Mama Laurie, Hoochie Laurie, Trudy) Still officially the funniest person I have every met, with an unhealthy obsession, not even obsession, 'lifestyle' of the Simpsons and Seinfeld. She and I met in Year 8 I believe, altho we met a few times before, oh yes, at the footy ground when our bros played together and Loz wore a frog-green tracky every week.... ah d d dude   Prue:  (Prudence, Tehan) Yes another young lass from St Mary's primary school, in Grade 4 when we played b'ball with the Spectettes (hence the DJ name) other sporting escapades with Tehan involve being two of the 3 girls on the footy team... I'll never forget that goal girl, you're a star....   Guy:  (Yug.... hmmm gots to get you more nicknames) Even tho it seems he has disowned us, or just silently reading along in the comfort of his Indian brothel bedroom. Met Guy in the latter half of 2000, at least officially, before then we both tried to act too cool for each other. For any pop-diva enquiries refer to this oracle of knowledge as they take up at least 80% of his rediculously large collection. For his witty bitter scrawlings on celebrities, novels from the turn of the century and possibly how many weaves Marcia can wear refer to Sympsosiasts.   International stars:    Anna: (Banana, Anner, Nanna) I met Anna over a beer anda scream-along to Bon Jovi's Livin on a Prayer in 2000 when she was on exchange from America. You might have seen her at such Aussie appearances as my bro's 21st in Melb, dancing in the old cage podiums in Connections Nightclub, or busting Tai-Bo moves in Unit 39 Student Housing. We did NYC together and she was there at the very first meeting with Carlos, ah special memories...  I think I've covered most of those who blog frequently..  I'll be back to explain those who people talk about a lot and have never been explained. but this puter is a bitch and i can't be bothered right now.  bitchin.

      Damn! I was going to vote for DJ Shampoodle. Everybody check out the Kings of Leon album cos it's mighty good.   Other things worth checking out: - Pumpkin. It was bottom of the charts when I was a kid but now as a veggie's go, it's got cred. - My new SonyEricsson Phone which can similtaneously launch a protective network of early-detection missile strikes against insurgent terrorist countries while taking photos of Ian Watson spewing in his front yard after a big night. Gotta love technology... - The new series of the most excellent "six feet under", miss at your peril. Monday's on 9 - Virgin fucking airlines. Check them out for their shithouse service, lack of food and inflight entertainment, skanky air hostesses, incompetent and sadistic baggage handlers and their ability to send your guitar to Maroochydore when you travel from Melbourne to Sydney on a simple 2 hour flight. Fucking brilliant.

      Wel well well its good to see the suggestions are flying... there have been others not published eg.  dj cabbage, dj sham dj shampoodle dj fun dj shit  and i was thinking about trying to spell that noise that you made when you were little to immitate a retard by sticking your tongue under your bottom lip when somebody did something stoopid. you know what I'm talking about Noni, I do it to you all the time.  I'm a big fan of DJ Missy G&T, thats excellent, but shayne is right I can't name myself that's lame so come to a decision, gimme a vote peoples: A) DJ Shampoodle B) DJ Missy G&T C) DJ Nadir D) DJ Ezla E) DJ Spectette  by the way this is a serious vote and I don't wanna look like a dick so I guess  options A and E are out of the question.   Yep, updates party at Etho's rocked my world, I got some Ratcat appreciation after leaving Leftbank the land of hideous Kylie, House and lame Hip Hop. Amplifier continues to rock my world and if Ihave been fired already from DJing I will certainly be catching the Cassanovas there on Sat nite. Furze looking forward to you hitting the westside on Friday, 80s night here we come you can check out the dance routine me and Noni bust out religously. Laurie you best be saving some of that confectionary lovin, and likewise saving the bday party till i get there!  that is all, goodbye to him.

      Hey Buntine and bloggers...  So it's been a while since I've jumped on the blog, and I see this week we're debating soup diets and DJ names.  Whilst I can't help you out in the diet department (although one pack of Marlboro Reds consumed daily for a month should help), I've decided to respond to the call for DJ Name ideas (never mind that I actually don't know the guy who put out this call - who are you Shayne????).  I'm thinking you want something that says "I'm  cool...and it's effortless...don't you want to be me?"  So here's some ideas...  DJEB (yeah, yeah) DJ Wiggedy Wak (can't really say this says 'don't you want to be me?', but you never know...) DJ 'tude (not DJ ATTitude...that's not effortless at all!) DJ Hughes (a veiled reference to humble East Malvern origins) DJ Shizzle ma Nizzle (supposedly african american slang for "I agree with you wholeheartedly black man") DJ Kali - "the most fully realized of all the Dark Goddesses" woooooohhhh... DJ Spectette - Ok, unrealistic I know...but it would be very amusing for interstate visitors and parents!  The thing is Buntine, when you get behind those decks, you BECOME this alter-ego, so it needs to be something that dispells any ideas of previous damning music preferences ('Girlfriend' anyone?) which may seriously damage your street cred.  Then again, who am I to talk?  Be prepared for me (and I'm sure several others) to live vicariously through your after-dark exploits in the land of free drink cards, door lists, and doof-doof!  We're so proud of you Erin!!  Anyhoo, I have to go brawl with a warehouse manager....  10-4 rubber ducky!!  Over and out.  PS.  Katie.G, I agree you are the best dressed in Glen Iris...but bogan?  No, my friend...no.  You don't finish your sentences with the standard call of the bogan-species..."but".  Eg. "I'm going down to 7-11, but"  PPS.  Erin, you need to remove the reference to my sleeping habits from this Blog!!  I did a Google search for my name the other day, and that's all that came up!  Funny, yes...but I don't look forward to meetings where someone makes reference to my ridiculous "snoring and violent knee jerk" habits.  Pleeeeease...to preserve my professional credibility!

PS Andrew the new emanual film clip is amusing and the song sounds like a poor mans pop smashing pumpkins adoresque type thing.... and if it's any concelation I saw emanual on Chanel V yesterday and he looked a little on the EXHUSTED side....poor fellows   PPS I'm still unemployed  Laurie come make Katie some Pie....

      okay it seems there has been a major effort to give this blog a good kick in its dying arse, so thought i'd better get involved. in answer to questions thrown my way, although they seem slightly absurd, yes andrew i have kangaroo paw in my shop. but none of this boring red stuff i have black and lime green kanga, i think it is pretty sexy.  And shayne here's your sentence completed "there are no days left in october"  that's about as poignant as you are going to get out of me at the moment, i'm taking all measures to return back to my original form of hideously unfunny jokes, and the incorporation of the word doodle where ever possible.    ps furze, as erin seems to have fallen off the face of this blog, i'll tell you that she is returning to your state on the 30th nov, then you've got her back for good, or at least until she gathers the funds to stalk interpol around the globe.

      FURZE... There have actually been several variations on the E that have been named after cars.  The Green Mitsubishi - This pill was single handedly held responsible for the rebirth of Rave in the UK in the mid 90's.    Ferrari's - A solid little upper with a tingle of that old love feeling  White Mercedes - Crap pill, and the little Merc symbol on the front was actually a bodged up radiation symbol methinks.  Avoid at all costs.  I'm sure their were others...  I like this line you've taken to reinspire blogging so here goes...  Erin -  Is it true that you are in lurve?? Furze - Have you ever slept with a guitar or other musical instrument? Noni - Have you ever had sex outdoors, if so where, and did you like it? Panda -  Why are you so beautiful??? Hannah - Finish this sentence "There are no....."  Thanks Furze you give life to blog...

Katie G: How is the strokes album selling? Panda: Why are you so beautiful? Noni: What is the most outrageously camp musical number you've ever performed? Guy: Will you ever return to this Blogg? Not even to comment on Holly Valance's new single? Laurie D: How's the pad? When do I get to sip a chards with you in it? Hannah: Do you sell Kangaroo Paws in your shop?  Please answer at soonest convenience!

      Ok, OK i've been so very, very slack, but hey I've also been very, very busy! Um, so last week I went to the ARIA's. I promised this blog I would go with the full intentions of being the reporter on the spot, but due to a most insane amount of alcoholic consumption details are very hazy. I was certainly too inebriated to keep count of Delta's awards during the night and most definetly too inebriated to do anything but dribble on her when I met her later at the afterparty. To her credit she didn't call security on me and even smiled. ohhh...  ARIA points of note: - Getting out of a limo and onto the red carpet with the Gudinski's and the Emmanuel entourage was a buzz, I won't lie. I even signed an autograph. ha! losers... - Seated on my table was a mixed bag, Peter Hellier, Dave Hughes, Andrew Denton, Neighbours boy and the transexual from "Idol" - Grinspoon were on the table next to us and I can confirm that they are all complete dickheads. - No wonder everybody gets drunk the frickin ceremony is over 5 hours long! I can assure you that if it wasn't for the fact that I swapped tables and had dinner with powderfinger I might have been bored. - Everyone was dressed so boringly! What happened to all the great outrageous rock ARIA costumes of the past? I did my bit with a stupid hat and a purple pinstripe suit but it was not enough to stem the tide. - The after-party was the biggest monstrosity of drugs and alcohol, massively consumed by the one industry that knows how to partay harder then the rest. In other words it F%^cking rocked. Random celebrity spottings and pashes. Debauched conversations, loose-lipped gossip, shagging in inappropriate places, excessive cocaine use by everyone - it had it all. This wound up at 6am but the party, like a heaving, living beast, simply picked itself up and relocated itself in the hotel bar where virtually everyone (including myself) was staying. Just before 7am the sun came up and noone even paused for breath. The bar was still 3 deep when I headed off to bed at around 8.30am with a bloody mary in my hand and paul dempsey's mobile number in my wallet. what a pack of animals. I've been in detox ever since and I thank Perth for conditioning me adequately with the telethon a few weeks before.   SCHmannuell Watch: channel 9 this thursday night features a surprise schhmanuel appearance with yours truely performing live (proper live, like plugged in and all!) at about 10.20pm EST. I think it's Molly Meldrum this is your life or some shit.  Buntine Watch: Is anyone on buntine watch? can someone check there's still a pulse happening there cos sometimes she doesn't move for several days and you can't be sure...Ha! What's happening toots? When are you returning to my arms in (less than) sunny melbs?  Im out

      the blog has been very quiet... does this mean it's the end of an era??? I hope not, i hope its just a phase you are all going thru or sumthin.  If it weren't for other forms of communication i'd probably think you were all dead, or gettin some or somethin'.  I'm at work apu. I got here today, and i was in a shit mood. All i wanted to do was work quietly and have a little space.  But NOOOO!!  I work with some people who don't accept bad moods, introspection, quiet time, thoughtfulness or any of that other stuff that i mostly prefer to actually dealing with people.  So over the course of my shift, I've told a couple of people to FUCK OFF!!, who weren't actually customers, but co-workers.  So now i'm offside with everyone, except christian girl who has been quite nice, but strangely enough saying "meow" alot. (I thought cats were satans creatures)  I think i gotta explore my business ideas and get somethin off the ground that allows me to work with my friends or at least like minded people.  Lately it seems that the world is vacuum sucking my will to live... (not a cry for help)  Oh my god... I'm being a victim aren't i...!?  hmmm... i think it's time to get drunk...

      Ok ok, I'm writing a beefier blog but I'm not hungover, just drunk. That's right, I just drank a slab o beer with Bec and Glen whilst watching the Deltas, I mean ARIAS. I don't know why, I swore I wouldn't watch it, there was absolutely nothing good about the entire ceremony and I mean  absolutely NO good nominees.  No wonder Delta won every single fucking award! Because in every category she was up against the 'tough' competition of the fucking Androids (the snot you want to flick off your finger) and Powderfinger! The most past their prime band in the world! And as much as I've been arguing this with Bec tonight,  there's is absolutely NO need to bring up Delta's 'battle' with cancer  it has absolutely nothing to do with a music awards ceremony and has no place being the issue of a casual discussion between Rove and Delta in the middle of the night.  I just can't believe how fucking 'small town' our award ceremonies still are its completely embarrassing, and even more so when 'celebrities' such as Marcia get up and give  advice  to Australians about their attitude towards music in order to compare to the rest of the world. If we spent less time worrying about how we looked to the rest of the world we might actually be able to develop our own style and nurture artists in our own country and therefore we wouldn't be putting up with fucking bullshit like DELTA FUCKING GOODREM winning every fucking award!!!  ...hmm sorry I'm rambling. I'm just gald that the whole event was saved by Johnny Farnham's induction to the Hall of Fame and his tops performance of 'You're the Voice'. Good show Johnny, they just don't make em like they used to.  AND THE WINNER IS CANCER!

      These lyrics couldn't sum up my heart any better...I hope all is well in OZ. Errie---write me back ya hooch!  "If you don't treat me better, baby I'll just run away.  I don't know what drives you to play these silly games.  Come on baby, I'm much stronger than you know.  Sometimes, I'm not afraid to let it show.  When will you wake up?  I want you more than the stars and the sun.  But I can take only so much cool on your island.   I gotta brand new dress babe. Could it make you want to try?  Guess I didn't want to notice the stars gone from you eyes.   We could buy an airplane.  Build a home on the sand.  You could tell your secrets.  I could understand.  And by the morning, comes crumbling down.  And as you're leaving...wait.   I'm much stronger than you know.  Sometimes, I'm not afraid to let it show.  When will you wake up?  I want you more than the stars and the sun.  But I can take only so much cool on your island.  I'm cool on your island."  -Tori Amos (Y Kan't Tori Read)

I wanna sit right between Margaret and David and get in on the heated debates and share the joy of being paid to watch every movie that comes out and then share my views on Australia's oldest and favorite Movie Show.

      thought i had better throw another females view on the blog as it was becoming a bit of a furze/ shayne forum. so spanner's back. just recieved some email forward thing about friendship week and it had some quaint message thing that i thought i'd post...... "great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people."    it seemed sort of fitting for this blog, and i hope it can make us, and our convention for the discussion of ideas, feel like good, wholesome, interlectually superior people. don't know if it has worked for me am sure i'll still feel like having a good old fashioned bitch come tuesday when i can verbally abuse the dress standards on the red carpet at the arias. It will be guarenteed that the words "that outfit should be illegal, tart" will be directed at my television, followed by "so should your date."

      hi there everyone, sorry I've been a bit blog-quiet lately, been busy um.... thinking. Since Shayne gets to rave, I'm gonna throw in my 2 cents..  THE NEW STROKES ALBUM IS VERY VERY COOL  Trust me, I'd be the first to slag off the Strokes and complain that I'm over them, but I've been very pleasantly surprised. It must be incredibly difficult to be one of these over-hyped, rock n roll phase bands and produce a second album which is equally as good as your first (no matter what level of 'good' it really was) and add some extra kick to it. The first line of the first track is  'I wanna be forgotten and I don't wanna be reminded...'.  This album is actually quite incredible, I can't believe how much they've progressed, I'm hearing Velvet, Iggy, BRMC, Ramones and the whole thing only goes for about 30 mins.  over n out

      okay... I love the idea that a guy (total slacker ala us), who spent the best years of his life watching every concievable style of film from behind the counter of a crappy video store in some backwater berg in California, has become a gifted and era defining director who is calling his own shots in hollywood.  AMAZING...  I'm coming down of some kinda super film high (more instantly elevating than Donnie Darko, but not with the same character of substance, or humanity).  KILL BILL is a remarkable film (or half a film). It's like pure POP MUSIC, you know the stuff that will never go away, that actually doesn't get boring within six months.  The kinda pop that doesn't actually sell so well or get mainstream airplay. And whilst on the subject of music, the soundtrack for this film is beyond cool, it's totally (in)credible.    Hmmm... I'm not gonna rant anymore, I feel as though i've been turning the blog into my own personal film forum lately... so yeah go and see it.

      Ezla if you are going to survive the music industry you better become a cynical, bitter, hard-arse, butt-kicking pitbull. Goddamn Annie G(Manni's tour manager) is 7 months pregnant and she's still got more fight in her than a wounded tiger. Going head to head on her is making my brain hurt and I have a sneaking suspicion she enjoys it.  However she does give me a great insight into how a guy would act if guys could get pregnant. I swear there is not a sentimental, maternal bone in her body.   It occurs to me that this industry has a really nasty habit of producing many professionals who live their entire careers in fear of being fired and who spend their entire lives covering their posterior. I never ever want to live that way. You do things on your own terms or you don't do them at all. I would rather fail spectacularly in my own ventures than scrap around as someone's lackey for 20 years. "Plop" is the sound of me hopping off my soapbox.

      Hmmmm.... at work again... I think i've served seven people tonight at most, I love it. I really like the new post manager on the blog, so efficient... Hmmmm efficient.  I'd like to talk about Adam Sandler.... Still here?? Good cuz i got sumthin to say...  Now... here is a guy, that for all intents and purposes is an overpaid, oversentimental, formula recycling hack. Who milks mediocrity and the mass markets desire for mediocrity for all its worth.  And yet, in the hands of a gifted auteur who paid him a pittance (this guy usually gets something in the vicinity of US$20 000 000 per film) he turned in a remarkable and understated performance that refreshingly adds to the breadth of stand out american perfomance in the last ten years.  I can't imagine any other guy playing the lead in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE... PERIOD!  So, why am I going on about this???  Well I've been wondering if I should return to feeling contempt for this guy, as all he has done since this film is return to churning out his bog standard "loser with a big heart gets dumped on and then makes good"  crap, or should i be glad that for a moment i got to connect with a performance and get deeply involved in a film and somehow that had something to do with him???  or do i think about this stuff to much when i'm not doing anything??  hmmmm.... let the viewer decide  BTW, nice to see you bloggin' panda... oh and Buntine,  foil is also a technique used for smoking hash and other oil based drugs... like crack...   nuff said...

      Well it definately needs to be posted that the Diva truly is a Diva!  All should know that Noni was absolutely and purely delightful last night in Jaques Brel (second year musical theatre at WAAPA).  I felt very proud to sit and watch one of my fellow pump pad porch dwellers up on stage belting out what i must say was some pretty fantastico music.  So congratulations and bravo to one very talented and entertaining Diva (not that I didnt already have this opinion prior to the show).  Noni darling you are wonderful xoxoxoxxo

      Yo Noni, I'm on it. Got the live album, really amazing stuff. Props to  - My Perth tan, may it last a melbourne "summer" - Matty Haydn, a picture of poise, grace and concentration, kinda like diva in a ballet class - Internationally respected film director Shayne, stardom beckons, but maybe not the Casting Association. - Errie B for looking after my "little Creatures" shrine. Don't forget that shit girlfriend. - Das Panda for sharing her lovenest with the likes of me so I can watch movies. - Melbourne bloggers, who hibernate in winter because our fingers are too cold to type. But it's spring now guys! Laurie, Guy, Katie where are you guys?  That's it, I got nothin else except...   How does he do it? How do they do it? Uncanny and immutable. This is such a happening tailpipe of a party. Like sugar, the guests are so refined.  A confidence man but why so beleagued? He's not a leader he's a Texas leaguer. Swinging for the fence. Got lucky with a strike. Drilling for fear makes the job simple. Born on third. Thinks he got a triple.  Blackout weaves its way through the cities. Blackout weaves its way through the cities. Blackout weaves its way.  I remember when you sang that song about today. Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed.  A think tank of aloof multiplication. A nicotine wish and a columbus decanter. Retrenchment and hoggishness. The aristocrat choir sings, "What's the ruckus?" The haves have not a clue. The immenseness of suffering. And the odd negotiation. A rarity. With onionskin plausibility of life. And a keyboard reaffirmation.  Blackout weaves its way through the cities. Blackout weaves its way through the cities. Blackout weaves its way. I remember when you sang that song about today. Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed.   The most beautiful Eddie V - "Bush leaguer", Riot Act

      Yo Furze, if you want the latest Ani update of  To The Teeth , go out and get her latest live album, So Much Shouting, So Much Laughter and dig the track  Self Evident .  The last track on disc 2 rocks the fuckin world too.  But hey Blog, liven up.  A big good luck to all those workin on Street Scene and a big prayer for Shayno that the rain might stop around 7:30 every night - chill out Queen!  Stop raining!   And we hold these truths to be self evident; Number one: George W Bush is not president And number two: America, is not a true democracy And number three: The media is not fooling me  -Ani DiFranco

      well seeing as we're in a lyrics posting mood, I've got some pretty funny shit to share. Last night i was relaxing in the poodle love-nest (miranda's bed) watching The Living End program rage, which I might add was pretty fuckin awesome, I've got a new respect for them after playing the Manic Street Preachers 'Suicide is Painless (theme from m*a*s*h)' ...anyway, they played the song 'Real Men' by Joe Jackson, I'm pretty sure I've heard this song before, I've certainly never seen the clip, if anyone knows what Joe Jackson looks like (weedy balding white dude with glasses sittin at piano): then picture him singin this rather passionately.... and then laugh:   see the nice boys dancing in pairs golden earring, golden tan blow-wave in the hair sure they're all straight, straight as a line all the gays are macho see their leather shine  you don't want to sound dumb don't want to offend  so don't call me a faggot not unless you are a friend  then if you're tall and handsome and strong you can wear the uniform and i could play along     love that faggot line...

      while I'm at it - lyrics of the day...  the sun is setting on the century and we are armed to the teeth we're all working together now to make our lives mercifully brief and school kids keep trying to teach us what guns are all about confused liberty with weaponry and watch your kids act it out and every year now like christmas some boy gets the milk fed suburban blues reaches for the available arsenal and saunters off to make the news and the women in the middle are learning what poor women have always known that the edge is closer than you think when the men bring the guns home look at where the profits are that's how you'll find the source of the big lie that you and i both know so well by the time it takes this cultural death wish to run it's course they're gonna to make a pretty penny and then they're going to hell he said the chickens all come home to roost malcolm forecast the flood are we really going to sleep through another century while the rich profit off our blood yeah it may take some doing to see this undoing through but in my humble opinion here's what i suggest we do open fire on hollywood open fire on mtv open fire on nbc and cbs and abc open fire on the nra and all the lies they told us along the way open fire on each weapons manufacturer while he's giving head to some republican senator and if i hear one more time about a fools right to his tools of rage i'm gonna take all my friends and i'm going to move to canada and we're going to die of old age  -ani difranco, "To the Teeth"  don't know why this affected me so much today of all days, it just did.

      Would I have voted for Arnie? Would I have voted to put a slightly dense-attention loving actor with no political or economic experience in charge of one of the biggest domestic economies in the world with a population larger than our own country's? Would I have given the thumbs up to a guy who refused to elaborate on where he stood on any issue at all, knowing that he would get the nod against an unpopular outgoing governer just for being there? Would I have contributed to the confirmation that the entire American political system has completely gone off the deep end and has absolutely no bearing on reality whatsoever?   In high school, were you ever in a class that unanimously voted in as class captain the most inappropriate person, just for a laugh? In year 8 we all voted for Rodney Boulos, a large, socially demented bloke with glasses and a high pitched voice who got picked on shamelessly (Ezla you probably remember the name). Do 30 million californians share the same sense of humour?

Not only all that, but her music is fuckin  book  (Shayne, its the new word) She's gonna be my Big Day Out highlight for sure.... along with the datsuns... and the dandy warhols... and jet OK ALREADY ITS GONNA BE AN AWESOME BDO   'I wanna give guys pleasure, guys should be objectifying themselves! We need to see Hip Hop videos where women are dressed and guys are in little bikinis shaking around them, humping them.That's what my videos are gonna be! I feel  bad  for the guys.

      Shayno, I am *SUPER* impressed with your characterisations, but I think I will need another catchphrase, I wouldn't feel comfortable going round bustin out someone else's beef.  I'd also like a Batmanesque spotlight to be turned on everytime there's a Diva worthy emergency but not necessarily shining into the sky, just on me.  I don't think I'm particularly comfortable with how many small town parallels I share with Clark Kent, even my parents sound like hicks, not to mention the whole Geelong thing.  Surely I'm not mild mannered by day am I?  It just wouldn't feel right, perhaps I can be a cutting and sarcastic icemaiden a la Lois Lane instead.  Or me. Maybe I could have a specialty move, like superman's truth-justice-american way-stance, but a bit of Fosse choreography that I could perform as I end my high C and prepare to fly away.    We'll workshop it.

      am very glad i have been given the appropriate credit for coining that wonderful expression "eat your own dump" although i dont think it is getting  used frequently enough in daily conversation.  it seems to have slipped into obilvion like mellow yellow and tasmanian tigers, thanks simon - wink wink buntine you know what i'm on about.   speaking of gross things like the consumption of ones own turd, how gross would it be if we had skin covering our teeth..... just remembered this revolting thought and couldnt help but share it with you all. l'arge if you are out i know you are cringing.

      Hey Shayno, whatcha doin Friday night?  I ain't never seen Showgirls (the movie, not the bulemic skanks of MT).  Sorry to say we missed Furze makin love to the mic on Saturday, but we did manage to catch him missing the camera for most of his airtime.  Its beside you!  Where?  Beside you!  Ta muchly to all those who involved themselves in birthday cheer, Han, cheers to you coz your excuses are always so funny the value's just as good when you're not there.  Also, since Glen will be here next week for the rest of the Porch's life, I think we should try to book Brian Austen Green.  I know I was hoping to have Alison Hannigan play me in the B-Grade movie of my life (bad spiral perm and even worse miming to unsuccessful albums I hope to release) but c'mon, a haircut/color, simple piercing and she's not far off Little Poodle...

      jus a note - that american pie guy is called sean william scott, and i think that is a very cool casting call on your part erin. Furze saw you having a bit of a jam in the green room with ada nicodomedouolopolisaropolis on telethon, was very chuffed to tell my sister that i had meet "that guitar guy." sorry i missed you on this flying visit but given the behaviour and the "i have not slept in twenty-four hours" look of most of the telethon so-called celebs on sunday i think you probably had your work cut out downing the channel seven funded booze.  ah free alcohol........

      All those offended by Shayne's casting will be pleased to not that I HAVE CAST SHAYNE AS MR. SHEEN, I have also recasted Bec to be played by Jeanie Little, and Furze has recasted Sturge to be played by Jeff Daniels and has also lodged an official protest against having a 2ft Italian American play him in this quality production. PARTS UP FOR CASTING/RECASTING: Tiffany Wann (suggestion: Minnie Driver) Andrew Furze (suggestion: The guy from Dude Where's my Car and American Pie (Stiffler)) Miranda Flinn (as she just finished saying how much she hates Drew Barrymore last night) Erin Buntine (c'mon! I'm a girl!) Noni McCallum (JLO sucks and she is Laurie D) Guy Campbell (suggestion: The Belle and Sebastian loving worker in High Fidelity except with more hair) Kate Gardiner (suggestion: Drew Barrymore recasted) Anna Pellum (suggestion: Tara Reid)

      4 Movies that are so bad they're Good  1.  SHOWGIRLS The questionable tale of a girl who goes to vegas to become a showgirl only to realize that to do so you have to put in your time as a stripper first,  Now this movie is deliciously bad... Starring a host of television rejects including Twin Peaks Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and the creepy stick thin girl from Saved By the Bell, and Directed by the guy that made ROBOCOP!!?? I don't really know how this movie was ever actually gonna be the hot (as in dripping with sexy goodness) movie it is marketed as.  With the tag line of "LEAVE YOUR INHIBITIONS AT THE DOOR" I would also recommend leaving your libido, desire to be compelled and your gag reflex also. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of waking up and realizing that you are still drunk, it's awful but kinda entertaining in the right company. For Maximum viewing pleasure watch with: Cheap Beer and Noni  2. Re-Animator Now this is B grade horror in all it's glory. Here we have the story of Herbert West, a disturbing and obsessive mad scientist who creates a serum that brings the dead back to life. Only (like you didn't already know) when the re-agent is applied, the recipients are ressurrected as mad souless zombies. So why is this on this list I hear some of you ask? Mostly because of the acting. It's is so woefully bad as to be wonderful.  It also has a scene where a bloody,dismembered head goes down on girl who is strapped to an autopsy table. Terrific stuff!! Add to this an awesome score that is totally derivative of everything Elmer Bernstein ever did for Alfred Hitchcock, so if for nothing else it's cool for its classic hollywood musical cliches megamix. This is the genre film equivalent of sitting next to someone who has just bitten into a KFC drumstick and burst some kind of pus ridden abcess. It's distgusting but you take a guilty form of pleasure that it happened to them and not you.   3. STARSHIP TROOPERS Okay, this movie sucks... period... but there is something absolutely special about seeing ex-calvin klein models come b-string actors getting their faces blown off in high gloss ultra violence.  Also this movie stars Doogie Howser as a member of some kind of futuristic gestapo. PRICELESS!! As an intersting sidenote this film is also directed by Paul Verhoeven who is the genius?? who bought us SHOWGIRLS. This is the sunday afternoon equivalent of poking a stick at road kill, it's gross and you feel a little ashamed for enjoying it    4. STUFF Okay, this movie is about evil Yoghurt. That's right yoghurt.  You eat the yoghurt and it kills you from the inside.  This is one of those special kind of concept movies that could only have been made in the eighties.  It has all the hall marks of a great horror movie, including ominous shots of yoghurt tubs half obscured by shadows. There is no one that you would have ever heard of in this movie, in fact none of them probably ever worked again. The Stuff is the star. This movie is so funny it hurts.   nuff said

      i just realised how does aaron get a guest appearance at the porch but sturge has missed out on casting all together? has aaron even stepped foot on the porch?? aren't their any seedy comedic elements in this film at all??? think you'll find a sturge cameo might be required to fullfill an accurate depiction of hideously drunken and debauched porch life. but hey i'm not the director so it was just a thought, don't want to be blamed for trying to influence the "creative team".  and ps happy birthday noni, get the fuck out of the mega-lab at 5.25am. pps how good is saturday morning such a overwhelming saturation of excited anticipation for what lies ahead for the next 24 hours...... especially so this weekend with the wonderful telethon dominating our state.

      Shayno, I'm just gonna assume J-Lo will pe playing me because of the whole 'best ass in the world' thang.  Hannah, your talk of ruffled skirt only makes me want the eternally unavailable Ruffles chips but I too, will settle for popcorn.  But come on, what is this Alf/Panda business?  If you mean Alf a.k.a. Home and Away, I'd have to say he'd be a hit as Buntine (where's me flamin' beer Deevah?!!) otherwise, I believe Alf (the Alien) could only portray Leon (Putacupateaon), hello.... the jewish NY accent, the nose (not a reflection on Leon, more a reflection on jews, oh shit... I mean... something not racist or something... fuck, you get it) and I think the search for something way more adorable/intelligent/attractive/popular is in order.   P.S. Shayne is to be played by the GOOD/INTERESTING Keanu Reeves.  Whoa.        Yeah, and its my birthday.  Crazy.  Why the fuck am I at the Megalab?

      shayne that is the best idea you have ever had, apart from drinking bombay gin  - an idea which i am taking advantage of about now. perhaps you should throw aside a career as a production assistant and head straight into casting, think you have a bit of an eye for it. especially the large as jack black thing from which i am still wiping away the tears of laughter. think i'll just buy my popcorn and coke and head to the cinema in anticipation of the grand opening of PORCH THE MOVIE, hopefullly it will be in the same stylistic form as SPICE GIRLS THE MOVIE.  ps am going to find great ruffle skirt to wear on red carpet and hopefully get really hammered so i can stand on a chair and ruffle it until i fall off........

      ahoy-hoy agreed. both smoking and comics are cool... mainly garfield, i have no shame in being a 'non-cool comic lover'... and i have to agree with noni on the keanu front, that guy is never gonna redeem himself to the point where i still avoid movies in fear that he might've tainted them. What's also cool is I picked up the latest NME (With bonus awesome CD) for $4.50, fools!!!!!  Tell ya what's definitely NOT cool: zip disks, mac computers (only because i still can't figure them outand they seem so half serious like they really are just a toy which might break), r kelly, stale bread, prickles returning to my lawn, Amiel, Mama Mia, the slow resurrection of R&B sneakin its way over Rock n Roll, the hosts from Aus Idol especially the one with wig looking hair, my beyond battered phone which might be cool but isn't and MY FREAKING HAIR ... ah it seems the Erin"s Beef section is back.

      Furze, I'll see you and the boy whose "love dare not speak its name" on December 17... I've got tix for Xtina Aguilera! Promising to be the skankiest concert I've ever been to and I can't wait! Totally agree with you Erin, Oprah is losing touch. These days its all white picket fences, horse riding on the ranch, bland designer fashion and celebrity hob-nobbing. Just look at the covers of O Magazine. I had a total flashback the other day when I accidentally watched Ricki for the first time in like five years. NOTHING has changed. Why has she not been axed? I reckon the all time best/worst talk show was "Tempest" hosted by... Tempest. Actually, I'm sure Gabrielle Cateris' show could have been good/lame too. What happened to her? She's prolly like 55 now. Anyway, just heard the new Kylie single: its so trashy I thought it was Dannii. Here come the sounds of summer...   PS Laurie was TOTALLY wasted at her mega house-warming!

Smoking is so disgusting it is actually cool... 4. Keanu Reeves is actually a good/interesting actor...  5. Theatre at it's best, pales in comparison to film at its best... 6. Most song writing is simplistic, cliched crap (even when I like it)... 7. If there is a nuclear holocaust, only goths and cockroaches will survive... 8. The priest at my grandfathers funeral was inspired to become a priest by Ned Flanders from the Simpsons. (or they are actually the same guy) 9. I don't get drunk often enough any more... 10. We'll always have porch...

      yes yes hello. things i've noticed lately: - that Oprah is getting more and more removed from everyday life, and appears to be hovering in this quite leisurely paralell universe wherein we are concerned about patterned drapes, free make-up kits and the biological body clocks of women over 40 who have realised that they preferenced their career over having babies and now... sob sob... its too late... sob . - that ET is getting more and more rediculous, the other day I timed that they spent 7 mins telling me what they were gonna tell me after the ad-break. And are now stretching 10 mins of footage (usually about that dude from the problem child movies who died in a 'freak onset' ... on set) into an exclusive cover story which lasts a record 2 weeks. - that I'm watching a lot of television - that ADBUSTERS really is the greatest publication ever made, CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITE ON THE LINKS LIST

      hmmmmmmmmmm...it seems I thoroughly fulfilled my promise of getting more wasted than ever before last night. The memory is hazy, the brain is numb, the jaw is aching and the pain is real but these are all signs that the last Scotsman/Connies was fuckin awesome.... despite my two hour cry-fest from 5am-7am before passing out at 8. Apologies to anybody I lectured, groped, embarrassed, offended or smooched against their will but you know my ways and you all seem to still hang out with me so it can't be that bad.  Special props to Shayne and Little Poodle for counselling me during my prolific meltdown I owe you.   Sitting in a now very bare, dirty, ugly and horibly un-red and black bedroom with nothin in but packed boxes, a thousand awesome memories and a sad (big) poodle.   Damn having to spend my last days cleaning!!!!  Damn finally having the trifecta and having to leave it all behind!!!!!!!  and damn this CD I've been listening to for the last 4 hours I've just realised!!!!!!!!!!!!  cheers to Homer Simpson on all his recent charity work!  cheers to this rusty tailgate!  out.   ps - school of rock rocks

Furze, me with boobs is not a fantasy, it's been slowly happening for about 6 months now, and yes it is strangely nurturing.  It will be the last time we are all together at scotties tonight...   furze and noni, wish you were here.  Everyone had better be ready to drink like they never have to do anything again.

      Got this little gem from another blog site 'London New York Paris Munich':   HOW TO DO A TOP ALBUMS LIST: inspired by Pitchfork's revision of its own Top 100 90s albums list (and don't think I don't sympathise with them).  1. Assemble 'staff'. 2. Go to pub. 3. Drink a lot. 4. When all are drunk enough for their real actual tastes to emerge, start the count-up. Somebody names an album they think is great. This is #100. The next person names another. This is #99. Continue to #1. Make an asterix by any that spark off drunken argument and a double-star by any that get people singing. Keep drink coming throughout. 5. By the time you get to #1 only scientifically terrific albums will be being named. To increase the truth-value of the poll you could start the count at a lower number but you don't want people getting too bored. 6. Publish poll, adjusting places by up 5 for an argument and up 10 for singing. 7. Bingo!

      Hannah your post about Basil, the dockers and the papparazzi made me pishhh myself. Haven't laughed that hard in ages.  Basil Zemplis is my arch-nemisis (he's replaced Errie's brother). The highlight of my year was cutting his lunch fairly and squarely under his long nose at the telethon afterparty. As I walked out the door with a certain Ch7 celeb he'd been tuning all night I took a moment to turn to him and say "goodbye little Perth man", a comment he found to be delightfully offensive. This man is a dick. He is excluded from the BLOGG CHALLENGE by virtue of the fact that a) he's too easy a score and b) if any of you sleep with him I will never talk to you again.   Shayne with boobs would be strangely nurturing. And I Do NOT look like Hillary Swank!

      Ok wait a minute, do these celebs have to be Australian, , cos I can hardly deal with that let alone having them ONLY BE FROM PERTH!! But yeah I have to increse my celebrity sex life... not that it really exists to increase but I've got a taste for it now there's no stoppin me!  So I'm taking my list from either Aussies or those soon to hit Aussie shores:   1. Courtney Taylor-Taylor (Dandy Warhols) there is no denying that this is one of the sexiest men alive, and seriously should not be hard at all.... simply wave a huge wad of Coc under his nose and lure him away.  2. Paul Dempsey: God damn it! If I don't sleep with that guy soon I'm gonna explode... damn him and Stephanie never parting as they are going out and in the same band and she's even at every one of his solo shows.... but I will find a way  3. Peaches:Possibly purely for the educational value. that girl must have more tricks up her sleeve than David Copperfield   OK OK I"LL GET MORE B GRADE!!  4. Susan Kennedy 5. Jack Scully  I will be making no further comments regarding Neighbours characters who may or may not have been mentioned here. end.   PS - Wouldn't be funny if Shayne had boobs? ;)

      hey actually my blog challenge -  find a perth based celebrity you would like to take home and have your wicked way with and not roll over in the morning and want to chew off you arm so you can escape before the paparazzi arrive to document the moment forever.

      This new Blogger challenge is considerably easier for you east coasters who actually have some form of minor celebrity contingent to your population. so as far as pumpin' a celeb without me leaving the state this looks like my options as far as i can see...... let me say the situation isn't lookin too rosy.  1. Basil Zemplis, for those not in the know a Greek closet homosexual who reads the chanel seven sport report in between getting his ugly gob in every social pages with a series of 16 year old looking blonde models. my method...... rock up at a telethon afters party, try and side-ways pump his leg very inappropriately and say "but i thought this is way you like it?"   2. Any of the Dockers players, strong emphasis on minor celebrity factor and on the fact that even that is basically in their pea-sized brains, and off-season muscles.   3. Zara from Zara, troy and bernie breakfast radio. because she is definately NOT the most hideously abhorent, rebarbative looking and sounding woman in the world. insert serious sarcasm here.    okay i'm booking a plane and going interstate this situation is too dire.

      That's right Erin. everybody remove yourself from the commercialised, corporatised world this Friday when you buy nothing. Check out adbusters.org for all the details and a good laugh. While we're on the topic, McDonalds food is the most disgusting slop you could ever put in your body. I try to avoid it like the plague but about once a month I'll get hungry, there'll be nothing else open and I'll go the maccas burger. For the next 24 hours I experience "Macca's Regret" as my body asks me "Why are you feeding me the kind of shit you wouldn't even feed your dog?". Alas I have no reply, except to promise that it will never, ever happen again. I hate McDonalds. I also hate that if they had the power to take down this website they would, just for the sake of a few anti-macca's comments.   Please take the time to check out www.mcspotlight.org and www.mclibel.com and find out how nasty a multi-national can be.  Also speaking of making promises to yourself (poodle) that you know you won't keep. I find that my "never drinking again" promises aren't even lasting the day anymore, I'm just straight back on the sauce. Either I'm invincible, incorrigable or I just simply have a problem...   AND if i read between the lines my dear snacky poodle...did you sleep with a member(s) of my favourite WA band? Props to you if that's the case. Which has inspired me to throw down a  NEW BLOG CHALLENGE:  Everybody should endeavour to sleep with one form of minor celebrity before the end of the year and report back ASAP. We need your wishlist and how you think you'll achieve the deed straight away.   My wishlist (and how I'd bag em')  1. Rachel Griffiths (or at least the nympho character she plays on "Six feet under") - Lure her into waiting limo with the promise of good Coke at AFI awards after party.  2. Sandra Sully - Bed her by sneaking into Channel Bert and changing the news autocue to read "God I'd love to boink that Furzey bloke in a number of positions right now"  3. The blonde off Hi-5 - Charm her into bed by hanging out at weight watchers and comparing eating plans  4. Natasha Stott Despjo - I think all I need to do is guarantee her my vote and "rock" cred and she'll be putty. Failing that I'll tell her I play AFL  5. Anyone even slightly famous but who has not appeared on reality TV or Australian police drama shows. Don't care as long as they don't fall into this category.

      please note:   NOVEMBER 28 IS INTERNATIONAL 'BUY NOTHING DAY'   if you're a hypocritical moron like me who eats McDonalds 5 times a week, buys overpriced label shoes, obeys commercials as if they were messages from god but still like to think you have some kind of political conscience then this is the perfect opportunity for your 2 cents..... BUY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH IT ON NOV28!  According to the Adbuster Buy Nothing Day survey, 62% of Americans intend to buy absolutely nothing, c'mon people if the kings of capitalism can do it so can we!   DOWNLOAD A POSTER  urlLink HERE!      ALBUM OF THE WEEK:  ELBOW - Asleep in the Back ..... excellent excellent band kind of reminds me of what Radiohead could've become although I hate saying that coz they must get it all the time, they're excellent anyway despite comparison

      Furze I don't think you should be complaining about a gig that's actually  ON  IN THE CITY YOU LIVE IN!!! Think of the poor westsi-eede who hardly get any gigs at all ... although the Panics wouldn't really be included in that list as they play in Perth practically every week....at least in Poodle's bed anyway (sorry Poods I couldn't resist!). Come to think of it, I'm very impressed with WA bands at the moment they're goin off! and more power to em!  This just in... Unfortunately Interpol will not be playing at this year's BDO but highly likely for next year's following the release of their highly anticipated second album. Its probably just as well, I think if the Big Day Out's line up got any better I might spontaneously combust.  over n out

      all the talk about boobs has reminded me how much buntine loves the word "supple". so stop your bitchin girl and go  carress (?spelling) your supple breasts.  ps apologies for the ridiculously unfunny display of drunkeness in swanky hudson bar last night, actually i'm not sorry- being drunk is good and all i can say is you saw me at the better end of the night - i went seriously downhill upon leaving, lets just say my drink of choice was for some reason unknown to me...... shandys. i didnt even get a pensioners discount.   just thought of another good reason for furze to invest in tits.... when he gets bored on tour or pre-show bla bla bla he can spend hours comparing his own new curves with the curves of  his guitar. just a thought.

      10 REASONS WHY IT WOULD BE COOL IF FURZE HAD BOOBS  1. They'd give you something to look at when he is talking shit. 2. They'd be great to whip out at bad taste parties. 3. I could cry into them when feeling sad. 4. They would look funny resting on top of his guitar as he played. 5. He would be able to wear BoobToobs and Tassles. 6. He could join the circus as a freak and become a carny and smell like cabbage. 7. WWW.FURZEBOOBS.COM 8. He could suckle orphans 9. Jerry Springer could do a show called "Why did you hide your boobs from me  Furze?" 10. They're BOOBS... nuff said  Cheers Furze

      Shayne my friend cheer up. No matter how bad things seem to be you have to remember that there are people out there worse off than you. Like citizens of Iraq which would just be the most fun part of the world, especially when Dubya threatens to finish off that particular little sortie by "cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer". Or you could have been an Australian Idol contestant. Or a working member of the Australian film industry, which has just been Royally fucked over by the governments free-trade deal (actually that's probably exactly what you are, this really isn't cheering anyone up is it?). hmmm.. stop now.    Actually fuck it. Everyone's entitled to feel sad now and then. If I was in Perth I'd give you a hug and a beer. Keep recommending movies, you have fantastic trashy cinematic taste and i love it.

      hmmm... It's been a few hours since that last post... I just wanted to clarify that i am not a fat chick, nor do i have bad breath or control issues. This is why I hate SM (not S&M for those unfamiliar with waapa) so much...  FILM REVIEW  EQUILIBRIUM  This film was released in the USA on December 17th 2002 with little fanfare and almost no publicity.  This also happened to be the same day that LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS was released.  So it kinda vanished into obscurity rather quickly and suddenly had instant cult status.  This movie was locally released on DVD this week.    It stars Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, who portray members of a  cultural gestapo called the Grammaton Clerics. They live in an authentic feeling orwellian dystopia where people are forbidden to feel.  To achieve this end all art and culture are outlawed and the population is kept emotionally sedated with regular doses of drugs. It is their job to destroy art and those who appreciate it.  The rest is for you to watch.  Bare in mind this movie was shot for a paltry US$20 million, by a 2nd time writer director.  IT IS SUPREME A GRADE B GRADE.

      well well well....thank you to all who came and celebrated my b'day and the end of an era at pump pad/faggot/porch pad etc etc.  It was full of fantastic moments as erin has already outlined, but yeah Howard..... what can we say. The fact that tom was standing next to him and thinking "Jesus that chick looks pretty wrong...." then Howard saying "hey Tom...!" is a pretty good indication of the extent to his bad taste that evening!!  So we have exactly 12 days till Buntine vacates the west side, 12 days until we say goodbye to our little californian bungalow, and 12 days until i move oh so far away to the sticks and bogans of semi rural armadale!!!!  SO JESUS CHRIST...LETS GET EXCITED!!!!!!! Ps thanks to the lovely shayne for all his wisdom and helping me to pass my independent study!

      think perhaps howard's out fit was in such bad taste that it deserves his own catagory. still thinking of that lip-liner drawn on moustache. tasteful, i don't think so. grant aka 1994 homo at rave party, or alternatively a road worker in that singlet, i believe is also worthy of mention. all in all good, debauched, drunken fun, APU i guess for the people of the porch.

      yo so the bad taste party was bad... which means it was good in a bad way. Actually it rocked.   Highlights include:  - Howard's outfit - Leon's outfit - Tom looking like a train drivin faggot - Tom jumping into the pool and then Terry jumping in on top of him  - The fight ... if you can call it that - Ben crackin his head on the bricks - Sarah's booty hangin out of her dress - the 'You're the Voice' scream-along - Pump dancin to the point of explosion - The entire lighting crew claiming that thier bad taste consisted of simply arriving with Sturge  another great debauched evening at the porch. congrats all.

      hello everyone, long time no blog.  i must say though, i'm rather glad i haven't looked on for a while, the amount of blogging where oz idol seems to be the only subject matter would have made me stay away longer had i known.    shame shame shame.  which reminds me, shayne shayne shayne, i saw kill bill last night (am now conditioned to extreme violence as everyday life) and was wondering if you were taking a trip to thailand anytime soon to by illegal unreleased dvd's?  i would really like to see the second volume as soon as possible and thats the sort of wanky thing you would do for a movie - so you could say you did - and i'd really appreciate it if you could pick me up a copy too.  thankyou in advance, i'll pay you back in feb.  ha, erin's workin everyday.  thats pretty funny - especially for someone with the color co-ordination skills of a kettle.  hope its going well buntine, but i'll thank you not to talk about my Nat King Cole and any snakes hissing in the grass around it.  lil' poo'l, heard the partay was a blinder, hope the Faraway Porch didn't travel to the Land of Deep Regret on Sunday.  Furze, keep thursday open.  And when I say, Furze, keep thursday open, I mean, make no plans for thursday (unless you have already in which case it really can't be helped).  Nonidiva says: Bloggers........ I lurve you......... and thats surmthin.

      hi all blog has been very uneventful the past few days so while i would hardly call this little litery passage "eventful" i am hoping it might count as a start. I have very little to report, am just realising that shayne and i are soon about to be the only west coast bloggers. Come december, we are going to be inundated with news from the east, that place so far away from us we should perhaps be another country, maybe West Australia and everyone else East Australia, in the same fashion as South Korea. but i doubt we'll be getting too many "great outdoorsy" programs covering the hot spots of West Aust. Bell Tower anyone?  Have browsed various tabloid magazines this week in an effort to get down with some topical gossip to blog about but I think that channel ten and every item of print media to come off the press in the pastfortnight is doing a good enough job of covering pretty much everything you have ever wanted, and not wanted, to know about aussie idol. in a nutshell kelly and millsy have basically slept with every other idol contestant except for each other, and of course cosima cause no-one likes her let alone wants to pump her. it seems to me the fact she is irratating, ugly, tasteless and unable to sing has worked against her, i don't really understand why? think i had better get off this thing as it is becoming very obvious that i need to get a life that doesnt involve aus idol.  oh actually before i bail, i have a quick point to make. i went to a fashion parade last night in which every guy was so camp, and every girl so severe faced masculine that it was difficult to work out who was who. they continued to think that we were buying the sexual inuendo between the guys and girls even though all the guys were looking past the girl models and making eyes at the hot gay guys in the audience.  I know this cause i was checking out these hotties too.......... but get over attempting to have faux sex on stage - it ain't cool and you don't need clothes to do it - which in my view are the whole point of a fashion parade. ciao.

      ahoy-hoy I'm just letting everyone know there is such thing as the evil Miranda, I woke this morning with gashes accross my stomach and an empty feeling where my intestine should be. .... I don't feel safe in my own home......    By the way... thought of the day: if you were to bring a stereo (battery operated) and a Delta CD into the Middle Ages ... wouldn't you be burnt at the stake? .... just something to think about.

      hey guys  Actually BMG has a contracted "option to sign" the entire final twelve as performers for up to a year after Australian Idol finishes.  So, I guess they're all damned if we do, or damned if we don't vote for them...  I think it would be really cool if Shannon won and released a cover of "crazy people rock my world". You know that stupid song that the popstars solo  winner Scott whatever his name was released that went straight to number 48 with a bullet in on its day of realease only to disappear from the charts three days later.    Now thats entertainment....

      Guys (and Guy) you have it all wrong. If you really appreciate Guy on Australian Idol as a singer and you think the public deserve to hear some more from him you must vote SHANNON. The winner of Australian Idol is doomed to a pathetic and frivolous contract with BMG, the biggest losers in the australian music industry. They are bound to accept whatever management, songwriters, producers and A&R is thrust apon them with no say at all. In many ways this is worse than the situation Bardot and Scandal'us found themselves in. The record company and "support team" have a licence to spend $1million in the winners name and every dodgey studio hack, producer and manager will be putting up his hand for a bit of the pie while all doubling their invoices and condemning the Australian Idol winner to a lifetime of music industry debt.  If Guy loses he will immediately be snapped up by a rival major in a bidding war that will see his personal fortunes soar, while giving him a chance to put together a release that some of us may actually want to hear, let alone buy.  So vote Shannon, cos I wouldn't wish winning Australian Idol on my worst enemy.

      Erin i'm going to try and pretend you didnt say all those mean things about lil Guy, and i'm going to try even harder to convince myself that they were all based in fact. Think the later is going to be impossible to do. I seriously can't understand how shannon has got this far it is starting to look like some kind of joke when they perform next to each other, and he's doing bloody "working class man" on sunday because "it's the right song for me, being just a workin class lad from the country and all." Do you think he could milk the sympathy vote a bit more if he tried??? i don't. vote for guy. okay here ends my beef with aussie idol, just watch out blog if shannon does win. That opera house is going to have to worry a little less about a terrorist attack and a little more about psycotic guy fans like myself driving a ferry into the Concert Hall.

      hey yo. is it just me or does the format of blogger change every friggin day? this is fucked maybe its just coz I'm on a shitty mac. Anywho.... I'm moving to Melbourne in 3 weeks. Hmmm I have the feeling this is gonna be a rather traumatic experience being torn from my Perth family who in truth are closer to me than my real family.... Its ok I'm not gonna have another breakdown. Can everybody please vote for Guy on Aus Idol even though he is hiddeously ugly , has a bad imitation afro, 10m long eyebrows and more vocal gymnastics than Mariah in the 'Emotions' days, there's no way I'm gonna let him lose to that karaoke singin country fuckin bogan who can't sing for shit. If Shannon wins its just gonna be another embarrassing representation of Australia, cmon! we have to break the trend! I realise I told everyone I was boycotting the show after Paulini got booted but really, what else is there to do on a sunday night?  Just like to point out that everyone has to drink as much as humanly possible for the next 3 weeks, I'm goin hard then goin home!

      Erin it is great that you are in love because it is the best feeling. No I'm almost sorry you have to leave it all to come back here. The answer to your question is "yes", but that's all I'm prepared to say at the moment.  Guy  - (and everyone else). I WAS at the now infamous Molly Meldrum "Toasted and Roasted" special that 9 filmed last week. I can confirm that reports that it was terrible were not exaggerated. In case you didn't see it Molly was in the papers last week, labbelling the night a "Gay-bashing" and threatening to sue. I have had a few problems with molly over the years but in this case he was justified. I've never felt so embarrassed to be part of a TV show.  Virtually everyone who got up and spoke embarrassed themselves badly. Few, if any, of the guests had really knew him or had been part of Molly's life and it showed.The night ended up being part footy-trivia night, part awful bad 21st speech, part badly conceived and produced Channel 9 slop.   Highlights included: - Sam newman stringing 5 poofter jokes together and inadsvertantly revealing he'd never had anything to do with Molly in his life - Madelaine West killing her burgeoining musical/stand-up career dead with a boorish and unfunny poem performed in the worst drag-queen voice since hugo weaving in Priscilla. - A complete lack of funny, insightful anecdotes, of which Molly himself has 1000's.  - Bert Newton single-handedly rescuing some semblance of dignity with a witty, humorous, respectful speech, whilst pouring scorn on all those who had spoken before him, most notably Sam Newman. - Molly, during his "right of reply" calling it the most boring night of his life. - Emmanuel Carella performing "The Real Thing" by Russell Morris. Um, yeah we rocked the casbah. Most people talked through it.   Apparently it will still go to air in a heavily-edited form. Judging from what I saw that will amount to a 15 minute special.   peace y'all

      despite all my efforts not to, i think i have become obsessed with australian idol. i was seriously so thrilled when cosima bossymumma de vito - yeah i'd veto her too, bailed out. i was quivering at the thought that the raggy doll Sad Sack impersonator with the bung eye Guy might leave my screen. so when i read that celebrity, debateable in this instance, obsession has recently been diagnosed as a form of mental illness i got worried. come nov 19 when this show wraps i am going to be wandering around in a daze that will indicate i have lost my way in the world.................

      hello. yes I am back, there's nothing to really explainmy absence which is the answer to Furze's question but might be because I think I am in luuuurve so that might answer both questions. Just spending some quality time before I travel back to the east si-eeede.  Furze! you better have got the Voice's autograph for me, I think I might be so obsessed with Farnsy at the moment I'm starting  to see blonde mullets everywhere and I'm considering having a Farnsy Vs Barnsy party where you either have to wear a denim or flannel shirt.  CD of the day: Patsy Cline's greatest hits. I'm taking some lifestyle advice from Julian from the Strokes, Riding a bike real slow whilst listening to Patsy Cline and smoking cigarettes. Ah the joys of my life.   My questions: Furze: Are you still dating a Blue Heelers cast member? Shayne: Are you ever gonna dye your hair and can you steal Zoolander on DVD from your work for me? if not I shall purchase Panda: Are you ever gonna remember your blogger password Noni: copped a snake in the grass lately?  bye y'all  "Guy,.... Marc said 'Yo... to you'" - aus idol

      hmmmm... It's kinda strange to put this year in perspective.  SO much has happened... and for those of you who actually "know anything" about me, it seems (overwhelmingly sometimes) like my life has become the polar opposite of what it used to be. A warm and welcome contrast that is filled with amazing friends, amazing times and a sense of real connectivity.  FUCKING AMAZING!!!!  I'm gonna stop now before i get all emotional and blubbery at work.  I love you guys, and miss some of you to.  see you all soon somehow...

      okay so the year in summation.......... i am drawing a serious blank, so unlike you erin i think i am going to crown 2003 the worst year of my life. think there are a few write home worthy waapa crew moments though..... * the drunk season that was devils tunic and all that went with it, becoming friends with shayne by being the smashed girl that would dance in his passage in her underwear at ridiculous times of night/ morn. * making large endure listening to me singing portishead at 5am after retro ball, even though i had lost my voice. * seeing big hair drunkenly fall of a chair and smash it into pieces while even sturgeon looked on and thought "can someone be this drunk and revolting?" * going to melbourne and falling in love, (if anyone starts a shittest moments of 2003, that can go on that list too) * just being able to rock up at the porch and know that erin will be there to have a gin/ beer with, no matter what time of day - post noon of course.  miss you girl.  i think i'll have to come up with a few more moments during my "year in reflection" session which i think i'll schedule for sometime tomorrow arvo. Just a chance to talk myself throught the ins and outs, the highs and lows, the blacks and whites, the cats and dogs..... of the year that has been. ill keep you posted, til then brace yourselves people a new year is on the horizon.

Pumping, drinking, pilling, snorting, dancing, screaming, laughing, fucking, loving, crying, singing, stumbling, fighting, hugging, missing....   I vote 2003 the best year of my life!

      yo.  so the Christmas circus is finally over. And now the fun of stampedes at shopping centers for what you think would be bargains but I've come to the conclusion that its to RETURN THE CRAPPY GIFTS EVERYONE WAS GETTING!  Now I don't wanna sound ungrateful, but you'd think my family would know me a little better than to buy me a BOOK ABOUT  KITTENS!  AND  PINK  TARGET PJs THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE WORN WHEN I WAS ELEVEN!!  Cello! I'm a surly all black wearing psuedo goth who .......   likes puppies!!  Now thats just taking the term 'silly season' toooooooo far. But no more complaints as I did unexpectedly score a stereo... and a lotta free food and alca-ma-hol...yay!  Alas, XMAS EVE, my fav night of the year is over and shant return again for anther 360-odd days *sigh*  til next time

But they only laughed at us... * Telling amy leeder that i couldn't talk to her anymore because she smelled     like boiled cabbage and ass. * Waking up in the rain after passing out in the garden at the porch the night    before my birthday, and in the drunken haze thinking that everyone had          abandoned me. * Discovering that there really are no consequences to anything that i do at    my job as a video store clerk...

      hmmm... looking back on past entries I see that the blogg goes up and down in waves. Sometimes there's an animated discussion going on (like wether or not I should get breasts) and sometimes people just got nothin and the blogg takes a little breather for a couple of weeks while we recharge our wits. I think bloggy blogg just had such a breather and I for one am ready to once again start throwing shit against it's bloggy walls and seeing what sticks. As for not posting much lately I'm gonna plead the old "been on tour with fabulously sexy popstar" chestnut as a form of defence yer honour. Now I'm sitting squarely on my arse in front of the computer and I've got nothing to hide behind.  Random points of (dis)interest  - CD buying is insanely addictive and even more so when you have money. In the past month I have purchased (and some are yet to even listen to)  BRMC - Latest album Bob Marley - Best of Beatles - Revolver (replacement copy) Pearl Jam - Lost Dogs Pearl Jam - Live in Boston (3 CD set wow) Pearl Jam - Live at the Garden DVD Cure - Best of Smashing pumkins - viewphoria DVD Tori Amos - Choirgirl Hotel (replacemnet copy) Jeff Buckley - complete EP's box set Beastie boys - Licence to ill ( replacement copy)* Otis Redding - Best of Ani Difranco - Evolve Stone Roses - First amazing album  *Replacement copy indicates copy of CD previously purchased that went missing due to siblings. I do not know of anyone else my age who puts up with this shit. This is the sole reason I am moving out in January  Anyhoo I've had an amazing couple of weeks with the Christina circus. I can't go into as much depth as I'd like because I suspect that there are people on the tour who have discovered this blogg (I feel so strangely naked). What I can say is that we as an act fully expected to get completely shafted by a big, American touring machine. We expected 5 minute soundchecks, rude/unhelpful road crew, aloof/disinterested backing band and a diva star none of us expected to even meet. I am so pleased to say that nothing could be further from the truth. Everyone on the tour, from the stage manager to Christina's nearest and dearest,  were exceptionally nice to us and made the whole experience extraordinarily pleasant.   I could rave here for pages about her unbelievably talented band who hung out with us all tour and shared their experience and weed with us most generously, but I won't. Tour highlights for me included;  - Performing in front of 15,000 screaming teenage girls, resulting in ultimate rock moment of nearly having to ask girls backstage for ID. Dangerous... - Sucking down bottles of fabulously expensive wine in a spa on a fabulous rooftop condo - The sheer inimaginable delight of having someone else haul all your gear round the country and set it up for you. Orgasmic. - Genital origami displays from our keyboardist (designed purely to shock our poor tour manager), the windsurfer is quite a feat... - My birthday in brisbane, huge hazy night. - Whirlwind tour romance with Cindy the massuese. Erin if you laugh at her name again you die. - The end-of-tour-partay with Ezla, Diva and Christina in attendance. I was so wrapped I could share that night with you, but I fear that you girls and free cocktails are a potent force that should not be repeated too often. - Being intimidated off dancefloors in clubs around the country by Christina's fabulous booty-dancers. - Being told by xtina's ultra-camp stylist that "for an aussie, you have style" - Being so wasted you forget which city you are in (Brisbane for the record). - Being busted leaving the Park Hyatt at 7am by laughing personal xtina security - Being busted by the cops in Adelaide doing 51kmph in a "temporary" 40kmph zone. Utter, utter bullshit and $165 later. these guys guys are almost worse than the perth constabulary  anyway, there's lots of other stories but I might have to send out a group email or somthing. Everybody in perth get your butts to melbourne and join me and Ezla in her new "smokers wing".    Erin thankyou so, so much for my birthday present. I get something more out of it everytime I see it and it's already responsible for a song being written. I seriously appreciate owning such a beautiful, personal piece. You rock and I love ya.  happy christmas everyone. All melb types are invited to my NYE bash, details to follow.

I was under the impression that nobody was even reading this anymore.... and now its worse, people are just reading without writing (Guy and Laurie, I'm looking particularly in your direction!).  The blog has had its down times, that's undeniable, but this 'murder'. if you will, is probably more for my own sanity.  So perhaps I shall spend some time away from the computer and see how that works instead.   And Shayne, I aint got no msgs from you  ever!  since I been here I don't think! so don't be playin me fool!  And poodle, you know I'm a poodle person I don't want no pussy galore hangin in my hood yknow what I'm sayin?  In other news,  a) the 'Erin Wing' is finally complete, the guest room is looking delightful and ready for any perthonalities/drunken Melbournites to crash in.  b) Ryan Adams' 'Love is Hell' Part 1 is quite excellent and a safe alternative for those wierded out by his other recent release 'Rock n Roll', although it sounds dangerously Radiohead-ish there are a few lil gems on it, including the inevitable recording of his 'Wonderwall' cover and 'some french journalist' on 'Caterwaul'   Quote of the Day:  Of course a Ryan quote from the song 'Afraid Not Scared'... bizarrely summing up my feelings of the past week...   'Look at this ocean with everyone drowning, idiots Screaming, and everyone sinking in slowly We're surrounded In the yellow lights of the city, Wasted as bodies, in bed with somebody A touch away with nothing to do We're surrounded  I'm really dying in here I'm really dying in here And I'm afraid - no I'm scared'   -Ryan Adams

      poodle...how dare you threaten the blog!!  how could you murder your own child??!! woah..that was a bit full on...sorry!! i'm surprised you havent blogged about your new pal christina in detail yet, man i love that line to the security guy "do you have anything?"!!  Plus i think its the melbournites letting the blog down...where is guy, furze, lorrie d, noni etc? i'm with shayne...everyone does have heaps of work, han barely exists anymore, i think she may have started growing bulbs and petals and shit! and i simply wouldnt want to bore everyone with my mundane existance...who really wants to know that my fish jean (pronounced shjohn) michelle has lost all his spots and is now just orange and white.....or that i spend most days trying to coax my cat to come and sit with me on the back lawn! oh and on that note...erin do you want to get a kitten when we find a flat?

      Now i just wanted to point out that as much as i deplore christian/pagan holiday rituals.  I am finding myself feeling quite festive and earnestly hoping that you all are gonna have a great x-mas/new year.    Anyone in perth without family can time-share with me for the day as I can't pass up the $52 bucks an hour to work in a video store on x-mas day. So my family can also be yours from about 2pm onwards.  No charge.  So yeah... In all seriousness.  Everyone be safe and wonderful whilst drinking and partying.  Make sure you consume your drugs safely and with loving moderation.  Love to all

      Stop being a dick erin...  ... you know, I sent you two SMS messages the other day, albeit one was a joke in fairly bad taste but the other wasn't, and you didn't reply.  Do you hear me threatening disconnect my mobile phone or dissable incoming calls from your phone.  NO!!!  People are a little busy lately, what with it being summer, and increased work demands and decreased access to the internet, and some new relationships and whatever.   Life is going on...  Speaking for myself I really love this blog and although I haven't found as much opportunity or not quite been in the right head space to blog very much of late. I would be very upset if you used you admin power to end this blog.  You may have created this blog, and also have the power to uncreate/delete it.    But think about what is really leading you to consider doing that and give me a call and talk about it if you want...  love you erin  but chill out, and get out of the house some more.

       PLEASE NOTE:    Due to unpopular demand,    I will be bringing the blog to its inevitable end   that's right...   THIS BLOG WILL CEASE TO EXIST BEYOND DEC 31 2003   unless there are any major objections, which I don't think there will be, it seems this group of friends aren't all that interested in communication anymore.  signin out. e

      Okay.  Here it goes.  Went to Xtina last night, fucking amazing show. Highlights include her outfits goddam I wish I could wear them (excluding the G-String and leather chaps thang) and the Death-Metal version of Genie in a Bottle. Also seeing her panic when the crew brought out a birthday cake for her and she lost her place in the script.  When it had finished, a young chap who I had just watched on the giant screen strumming away came running up to me, young Furzikins who I am once again in debt to. Asks me if I wanna go to Xtina's birthday party............ DO I? AND HOW!  So after that, basically we get there.... she walks in I actually have some bizarre excited panic attack that she is standing right next to me.... and is so tiny I almost looked right over her. So I go to light up a smoke and get told off by that Michael Gadinsky (spelling?) guy... apparently 'no smoking round the star'.   Proceeded to get absolutely shitfaced (worse than ever before) on cocktails at their expense, got NoniDiva in... we booty danced........... I walked over grabbed Xtina's hand, shook it, told her I have a new found respect for her (like she cares) and that Ireally enjoyed the show, cos there aint no way I was leaving without talkin to her.  Got very very very very drunk........ I remember dancin witha lotta booty dancers and then the next thing I knew I was stumbling around Crown Casino and I think I recall Noni saying somethin bout bein on 'Erin Duty'??????  think i got a taxi......fuck knows how i gave directions.  another awesome night in my 'Almost Famous' diary.    TOO DIRTY TO CLEAN MY ACT UP

      erin on my machine it says that you wrote your last entry at 9.08am, did they get the am and pm thing round the wrong way? was this 9.08am without having slept the previous night? or is ths most illogical explantion that you were awake after a good nights sleep in your time-warped 90210 infused bedroom the answer to my confusion? if this is the case you are on a downhill slide into normality girl. peace out dude.

      Ok most people may know that I haven't really been leaving the house much this week apart for the occasional late night coffee... so it seems a natural progression for me to become somewhat obsessed with Lord of the Flies. Having just finished it last night, I've discovered something amazing.....  THE GREATEST BAND NAME OF ALL TIME:           .......THE CONCH.......   That's right. For those unfamiliar with the story, in the very beginning 2 boys find themselves stranded on a deserted beach. They discover a large beautiful pink and white shell. Piggy informs Ralph that this is called a 'conch' and that it makes a loud sound if you blow into it. Ralph proceeds to blow into the conch and suddenly from all directions small children start staggering out of the forest attracted to its incredible low boom.  Thus 'The Conch' (the band) shall play such awe-inspiring music that all the kids shall be drawn to it. And it will restore their faith in their fellow youth and they will be reassured by the knowledge that 'something is being done, something brilliant is finally being done'.  I can see it now....  websites like .... www.theconchrocks.com  AND WE SHALL BE HUGE IN AUSTRIA FOR SOME REASON! and they will have T-Shirt slogans like....    THE CONCH ATE MY LONCH   yes its all falling into place...  all I need is either some musical talent or a lot of money....

      hi all bloggers, am going to continue this nostalgia sort of theme the blog seems to have adopted lately. went to downtown beaufort st for first time since mass exodus of waapa crew the other day and think panda you have coined the appropriate term when you say ghost town...... there is a small hint that something wonderful once infiltrated this humble corner of perth but just a skeleton of globe coffee and jack clothing seems to remain. don't think im going to head back in a hurry unless i am guarenteed to run into someone i may vaguely know, maybe some 2nd yr theatre crew or a theatre arts try-hard??  am fairly unsuccessfully trying to slide back into the world of having only one group of friends to drink with, am missing the world where people talk theatre wank without even realising they are doing it, and care enough about music and general culture to reflect it in what they wear and who they are without worrying if it was made by sass and bide or will be on the next ministry of sound annual.  and where are my people who will drink a cheeky g+t without asking if i get a pensioners discount with it?? don't get me wrong i am happy being the face of claremont but if another person calls me alternative for wearing a black standard wrist cuff and only one earring at a time then i think i may throw their skinny latte over their straightened hair.  hope all are well, am thinking of fond times of you all when we met at a place called the porch and not the blog  xoxoxoxox spanner

      "The Curiosity Show" was cool, and by the way erin it was a full half hour show on in the afternoons in the eighties.   I just looked it up on google and found this great website called "nostalgiacentral.com" which has a little page devoted to it. It also has indexed pages for TV and Music from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. Kinda cool, the sort of thing you would enjoy for a couple of hours erin.  feeling better now for having blogged a bit.  love to all

      So I'm watching 'The Anna Nicole Show' out of sheer curiosity (remember that show  "cur-i-os-it-y duh deh de dehh"  actually I don't think it was a show, more like a segment of a show or somethin...)  anyway, the Anna Nicole show is so much like a circus I was searching for an elephant (insert bad joke about Anna Nicole here). Firstly the theme song, if you can call it that goes a lil somethin like  'Anna Anna glamour Anna Nicole she's so outrageous!'  (what the?) This was obviously written before they had taken any footage of the woman, because there doesn't seem to be anything outrageous about her, she simply waddles around in ill-fitting fluffy fabrics with a vague expression on her face while her 'minders' have an ongoing lawsuit/catfight with ultra-camp incredibly stupid 'glamorous' stylist Bobby Trendy.   Needless to say, I've been watching too much T.V (I followed this up with a healthy dose of 'celebrities uncensored')  Also needless to say I'll be watching the show again for some good laughs and to see just how 'outrageous' she can be.

I preferred it when the blog was like this interesting but entirely superfluous form of communication between friends (melbs crew lovingly excluded here) who for the most part lived just around the corner from each other...  love you guys  back soon

      oh and another thing I've realised, which I never thought I would say  MMM rocks!  and I'm not just quoting early 90s bumper stickers! check this set list which I heard practically all in a row within an hour: The Vines Ryan Adams The Strokes The White Stripes The Music No Doubt Jet (surprise surprise) The Datsuns (!!!!) Faith No More  thats pretty damn good for a commercial station that's been playing cock-rock for the past 10 years.

      yes well the controversy begins... to all melbs pals, please don't take offense to my critcism of melb fashion, that note was inspired purely from hanging at chapel st for less than five minutes, I didn't actually take into account that some of u wear pink tops, heaven forbid. I have nothing against pink really, i have a few pink items myself... ref: hideous 80s belt that I wear to more functions than just bad taste parties. Han you need to hire some staff to do all this work for you while you rake in the benfits and start jet-settin to melbs for the weekends girl! and furze! where's the christina files? and when is this concert? I need to plan an outfit which is suitably skanky.

      Has been a fair while between drinks, hope all is well in everyone's respective little world's of blog. if anyone wants a structural modern interpretation of a christmas tree they can fuck off and go get a normal one with tinsel from k-mart. so many people with too much money pretending they are trendy, and/ or tasteful are infiltrating my life, ah well at least i'll be able to buy myself a nice tacky plastic santa's face to blu-tack on my front door, and some metallic paper merry christmas signs with the money they are palming out to their style consultant. who, for those who didn't understand - is me.

      things I've realised lately:  1. MTV SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its gone so downhill its not funny. Methinks I need to invest in channel V especially seeing as Big Day Out's comin up and I'm makin it my business to be on as many cameras as possible.  2. Melbourne fashion sucks. too much straight hair, pink tops, tight over-priced jeans (with fat-back hangin out) and all clones of each other. I miss individual perth, where the clothes you wear actually reflect who you are.  3. my life sucks. but this is not a new revelation  4. quite a few random peeps are lookin at this site and emailing me about it... which is cool!! bring it on!!! i love it, gold gold gold

      Hello to all bloggers!  I haven't gone to a big porch in the sky, buntine, though that sounds very nice seeing as my new dwelling doesn't even have a porch!!  Yes, I am back with ma and pa out in the sticks of Armadale!  It hasn't been so bad so far, but i have only slept here two nights since we moved out of the pump pad!!  There have been floors, couches, fold outs and trundles galore!  Special thanks to Shayne and Piche for accomodating me on random 12am visits!!!!  Poodle...it is nearly official, i am moving to the big smoke in Feb, so get hunting for a new californian bungalow!  Furze I hear there are expressions of interest regarding you joining the new edition of poodle pump pad...it's a whole new way of life!  Be prepared to find something in your bed whenever you arrive home, semi-conscious, surrounded by a moat of chocolate and hj's wrappers and moaning for a cigarette!  (I hope you realize i'm talking about Buntine and not me!).  Maybe at this pump pad I will actually pump, rather than be pumped (and i'm not reffering to getting laid, as everyone already knows), what i mean by pumped is continuously mounted and dry rooted by whoever hasn't seen their girlfriend/boyfriend in a whole day!! (ie Tom, Leon, Erin etc etc).  Anyway, i'm quite excited about moving, i just need to make a shitload of money some how...and no Erin, i'm not going into prostitution, even if it does mean i get laid!  So if any Melbournites know of any jobs coming up around feb...please post!   Hi Noni........! I miss you xxxxoxoxoxoxoxoxox Time to go, love to all esp. poodle

      Erin is once again studying up on her Mtv and gettin down with the kids... that means its time for....   CLIP OF THE WEEK:    The White Stripes - The Hardest Button to Button  Even though I cannot believe they've obviously released this song as a single, the clip is actually very cool.... if you watch it all the way through. Seemingly low budget until you count how many 'stripesified' drumkits, guitars and amps have been used, this clip has 'loads of effort for pretty crap song' written all over it. I'm just impressed with the strategic planning mixed with  the 'you can do this at home' value. check it out.

      Thanks Furzikins... and extra thanks for creating a tab in your name at the Gin Palace last night that was terrifically cool of you also terrifically cool of the diva to supply other substances... its seems I owe you both a night on the town as soon as I start freakin workin. By the way Diva, why you no blog no more? huh? It seems I shall be purchasing a car by the end of the week so I'll have to do the big cruise down to the Long of Gee for some good times.  Shayne I think the Gin Palace may be your natural habitat.. lots of Gin and cool photos from films in ornate frames... I fear you might never leave.

      yes well it seems the blog is a little quiet. Much like this 'family home' I've landed myself in. And much like this entry, I really don't have much to say "I'm so tired! No, Todd not now!" I'm incredibly drained and exhausted, don't think my body is capable of producing any more tears. I just wanna go home.

      Yo so the word on the new Tatt is that I have to go in for another 'design consultation' before I get it done and then make appointments for 3 seperate sittings .... god dammit! I just want it like now!  Basically its a whole lotta Orchids sprawled accross my shoulder blades.... but its gonna take 8-12 hours at $120 per hour....hmmmm this could get outta control... think I better tone down the design a little. Plus I don't think I could handle that burning hot needle digging into my skin constantly for 12 hours. ... I'm pretty sure I've blocked out exactly how painful it really is..... I just looked at my diary entry from my when I got the other one that says  DO NOT DO THIS EVER AGAIN ERIN! NO MATTER HOW COOL YOU THINK YOU'LL LOOK!

      am too scared to go to dentist in case they say i have to get my wisdomes out, am sure i do, was almost ready to bite the bullet until you just wrote all that shit about cotton wool and blood.  what's the new tattoo? you obviously have some sick obsession with pain for pleasure if you are doing that and teeth extraction all in the space of 48 hours, whilst coming off a week long bender.  all this talk  of pain is too much for pansy me, am going to get a beer to take the edge off this reality. ciao

My face has swallen up so much that I look like Mick Molloy (now)  and the taste of cotton wool and blood isn't very appetising...... and considering I'm supposed to be getting a tattoo all day tomorrow I figure this is gonna be a very painful week.  Furze I'm only answering what I'm capable of: 2) You're living proof 3) Definitely. Absolutely, no doubt about it. 4) I can dirty pash til the cows come home and it aint gonna mean a thing   ehhh headache... in fact everything ache.... t.v time..... and home made chicken soup... ehh i love my mama....

      Saw the Flaming Lips last night which means the BIGGEST WEEK IN ROCK is officially over and we have somehow survived. Actually I would be quite at home if I never saw the hotel bar at the Marriot Hotel ever again. My brain is still a little fuzzy on the details which is probably why a few questions remain unanswered... 1) How did Beat writer Clem Bastow end up snogging the lead singer of th darkness? 2) What is the longest possible period the human body can withstand without sleep? 3) Is it really possible to have an orgasm without sexual contact? 4) If you dirty pash someone (say Ben Hynes for example) all night is it still a dirty pash or is it something more? 5) Does anyone have photographic evidence of Ms Gardiner and Ms Tehan locked in embrace? 6) Is it dicky to wear sunglasses at night? Is it worrying if you actually need them? 7) Who did bridgy pick up on sunday night? 8) Have Kings of leon really been sent forward in time from 1972 to save us from metallica?  ant answers humbly appreciated...

      hmmm so its a little quiet on the blogfront....possibly because this has been the most  amazing  WEEK IN MUSIC EVER!... however, can I make it clear that I don't want any more people telling me how good the fucking strokes/leon gig was! I couldn't go coz I had to work dammit.... but I guess arriving at the after party at their hotel bar in a cool car with a driver and seeing Julian (of the Strokes) suddenly crack the shits after wandering aimlessly round the room and storm out with a new-found sex toy was  pretty fucking cool!   However what is not very cool, is how cool, cool people really do think they are... and how not-cool people (i.e non celebs) try to act so cool but it just comes out like desperation. Hence I sat on the couch, smoked my cigarettes had a bit of chat and left after about half an hour. In fact I didn't even remember being there until this afternoon. I will be spending the next couple of days trying to retrieve the large amount of braincells that I have fried this week..... and also get some hardcore prescription meds to rid myself of the worst jaw ache in the fucking world. But its all for the sake of music and the wonderous lifestyle which accompanies it........ ehhhhhhh ..... dammit back to being a pleb until the next gig comes around....

      oh   my   god.  This has been the stupidest, most outta control week of my life. And its only Wednesday! Furze you summed up almost exactly what I was gonna say....  Its official...   MUSE ARE THE GREATEST FUCKING BAND ON THE PLANET!    I kid you not people, I always wondered if it could happen, but  I have finally experienced an orgasm without having sex . Furze can account for my body shuddering from a climax that seemed to last for half an hour! And all from the combination of music, an audience that roared even ten times louder than the music and excellent excellent excellent drugs. Oh Craig I can't thank you enough......ah extravagance .... I was made for it!  Cheers to Grove the driver! I don't wanna say it but I reckon he's better than Ross! Cheers to Andrew for being so so awesome to rock out with and for introducing me to Craig! And cheers cheers CHEERS to Craig for  THE BEST FUCKIN 48 HOURS OF MY LIFE!   and of course cheers to MUSE for an  outstanding  performance.     SING FOR ABSOLUTION! I WILL BE SINGING!

      Unbelievablely Stupid Week of Rock -  Part 24: Muse I went home at 4am on Monday nite, only to recieve a personal invite to the official BDO afterparty. Walked out of the Marriot hotel bar at 7am and didn't sleep till 8. Unfortunetly I had to work all day in the studio so I headed out with Erin to muse last nite on about 2 hours sleep. I know there is a tendancy to rave on about great gigs you saw butI'd like to think I am a little bit more reserved with my praise, but make no mistake this was the BEST F%$#ing gig ever. Playing with confidence of a band completely on top of their game, muse let the music do all the talking. The most stunning thing about this band is the unelievably huge sound that this three-piece band generate, without backing tapes or nuttin! Tickets for this gig sold out in 20 min, so an incredibly knowledgable crowd virtually salivated over a flawless, stellar performance.  Post gig is a bit of a blur but it involves drinking expensive champers in a very expensive hotel room with some very good friends and passing out at 4am. So know at my brand new desk at my brand new office job (I know , me!??) trying very hard to keep it all together in front of 30 new colleagues. And there's still the strokes and the flamng lips gigs to come. Props to our new driver Grove and to the source of much extravagence , craig. THis week is completely surreal and I only hope I survive it so I can crawl back into the real world next week and detox. Strokes review to follow...

      ok so after i said yesterday was boring i put on an aussie flag disguised as a skirt and hit the pub. so things improved as they generally do with the consumption of alcohol. then i went to the skyshow with 3 melbourne people who couldnt get over the fact perth goes so insane for aussie day/ fireworks / aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi......... so me and 200 000 peeps praised lotto and its skyshow before we somehow rolled out of the park and back to the beer.  ps did anyone like that head band nicky kidman was wearing at golden globes i thought it was all a bit of a fashion faux pas but she seems to have won some serious votes for it?  And think cate blanchett stuffed socks down her top as her tits were flopping all over her table, inappropriate cate.

      Well Hannah I think I kick your ass (and everybody else's on that matter), I think I am having the most boring Australia day ever!!! I'm sitting at home watching The Simpsons ( which I love don't get me wrong) but I'm sure I could be doing better things with my time!! Erin thanks for passing on my number, that was cool. Although there is some funny news... The designer that mysteriously disappeared was no one else but.......... SHANNON! Yes I'm supposed to fix her mess. The director pretty much said in not so many words, re design the whole thing. Shannon's design was two flats with an oversized kids drawing of a penis and a 'magic box' centre stage for props etc... The show is about child abuse.  Well on that note I better get to reading and designing...  Love you all!!

      well think i am having the most boring australia day of my last 10 years, have just sort of got myself out of bed about an hour ago and am looking at this aussie t-shirt with about as much enthusiasm as i show to channel nine when it is screening the cricket. have been working like a flowers pshcho for the last three days doing flowers for huge greek wedding, which involved me starting at little H.E. Designat 4.30 on sunday morning. so needless to say i am a bit wacked especially since when i finally finished at six last night i decided to get out on the turps which was generally shit and involved more walking to find pubs which didnt have queues and taxis to take me to these venues than actual drinking.  Piche lets have a little drink this week before you go on your retreat to the land of Pam and Shannon. hope all are well on this day of the boxing kangarooo. Fill up your goon bag/ keg of swan draught, put a snag on the barbie, throw a lamington at you neighbour and salute a pavlova....... happy australia day team i'm off to the Sky Show!

      ah funny.... putting a disclaimer on the 60th... I went to a 50th last night purely for social reasons! And what a grand ol night it was.... and a good kick off to the completely drunken week ahead, even though Centrelink is threatening to cut me off and making me turn up to job training at 9am every day.  Meanwhile, shit! Piche I forgot you were goin to S.A I just gave a director your number coz I thought you'd be in Perth! Nuts.  Well tonight's the night!  I got a hot date with Prue 'hot lips' Tehan!!! I'm expecting very big things! Although I seriously doubt that my body is capable of any more alcohol intake... had to go to a Christening at 9am this morning still completely wasted........The priest got up and informed us that ol' Betty Crothers isn't very well and asked if we could keep her in our hearts, and that Catherine and David Adam are moving to Canada and could we pray for them... the way news was spreading round that church I seriously expected him to say 'And Erin Buntine is currently suffering the worst hangover known to man and could we each say a prayer for her' oh the pain.  I know you're all sitting there judging but I'm just livin it up before real life comes to town in 2 weeks.   out.

      So bloggers, went to a 60th last night (to work not party old school style!) and I thought it all to be pretty tame when Leon came inside to tell me that he had just been speaking to the host, and she told him that they used to party a lot, (the house was built for parties), and that they used to have orgies! Sarah asked if there were swingers there, she said no but she said we would of loved it when they were younger!!! Gross! Especially after her husband had asked me to wipe his brow with a damp cloth the next morning.....  Hannah where are you? We should catch up before I leave on the second....     Saw 'Welcome to the Jungle' the other night... I was a little skeptical about it, but it was actually pretty funny if your up for something entertaining! Also saw 'Love Actually' with Miranda and Leon, Leon said he wasn't emotionally ready for it... but it was'nt bad, showing different stereotypes of love, relationships etc... It was cute at times. Must say i'm hanging OUT for 'Big Fish', its only taken me 21 years to decide that Tim Burton is my favourite director of all time!!  Well Happy Australia day to all bloggers!!

      Oh man, SBS is serving up some quality viewing at the mo'...did anyone catch  'GOLDEN GLOBES - Hollywood's Dirty Little Secret'  last night? A golden insight into what actually goes on at the  Hollywood Foreign Press Association  and who these people actually are! Ok, Firsty HFPA have been dishin out Golden Globes for like 56 years or something, so you'd think that there must be some cred behind these unknown-to- non -celebrities faces.... turns out there are only 96 members, of whom only a third are actually currently contributing to the press in some form ... and most of that 1/3 are for unknown (to Hollywood) Czech or Greek newspapers. This means that 96 people (almost none of whom are actual film critics or know anything about film) are getting together and telling the rest of the world what the best films, actors and t.v programs of the year are, usually just after they've been wined and dined by the publicists and producers of these productions.  The funniest thing about it is that when the HFPA was founded all those years ago, the idiots made it a non profit organisation, thus explaining why most of the members look like distant relatives of  Fran Drescher , are usually the most excited people in the room at all celeb functions and have to run a business like a B&B on the side to survive. The only thing they get for free is getting flown to Film Festivals where 'they get treated extremely well in very expensive hotels for a week then fly back to L.A and catch the bus home'.  In fact the best quote is (can't remember who said this, probably some bitter producer or journalist)    "I think the reason why the Golden Globes is a good story is because its a great comedy.... about small people with huge aspirations, who somehow almost seem to have these aspirations realised. Its a great comedy about big organisations looking at small people thinking we can put them to use. Its a great story about how media culture will take all of that and turn it into something huge and that in fact will then have world wide implications... and yet at the centre of it, it means nothing"      Its incredibly amusing that everybody in Hollywood jokes about the Golden Globes and yet it gets larger every year and people kinda want one anyway even if they have to have their  photo taken with every single individual of the HFPA  (that's 96 different photos with pseudo cast members of The Nanny).  Its Hollywood, people have to be promoted any way they can, people know this ceremony is a joke, 'people know and they don't care'.

      okay blog very quiet, bit like a little mouse. shayne do you still exist, haven't seen any profound film debriefing in the last millenium?  maybe no-one blogging cause melbourne is a buzz with action, which is fine because i'm coming to visit so want some general excitment when the spanner hits town.  and ps erin when did you ever feel like we had responsibilites before at that tafe-like institution we went to? if you didnt want to do an assignment you just told pam to fuck off, at which point she probably was unaware there was even a class she was supposed to be teaching. think the last time you may have encountered stress and shit, as you like to put it, was back at school when all you had to do was stress out over how to make Morgie and her dramatic pearls of wisdom worship you even a little bit more.

      so i am at the pub with this girl who's holidaying here from melb, and i ask her where she lives and she says armadale, so i say "oh yeah i've been to The Armadale." she pipes up with "oh you should go on a tuesday there are these cool guys who play all these really cool songs on that night." so without any prompting on my part she promoted "Fucker" right off her own back. just thought you'd like to know furze that you have a little fan out spreading her love for your music all the way to the west coast........ needless to say she was devo when i said she had missed your farewell gig and that the andrew/ delux ship had sailed.....

      Ok, I've got beef, this coming weekend is Big Day Out/Australia Day weekend, which means the end of January.... HELLO? WHERE THE HELL DID JANUARY GO? Aggghh and now that I'm going back to Tafe, its kinda sinking in that my life isn't one giant holiday anymore and I'll actually have responsibilities n shit. I was so used to being tied to nothing except maybe my obligation to turning up at centrelink once a fortnight... but it was soo free n easy, not workin, not studyin, just kinda chillin n gettin wasted .... ahh the party is over... now I'm gonna have to study full time plus work 3 jobs and throw myself into the exact opposite of what I was doin.  Anyways, my point was that MELBOURNE HAS HAD NO SUMMER!! We've had absolutely no hot days at all, ok  maybe 2 in December, but nothin I tells ya! NOTHIN! I feel like I'm in a Perth winter. Not that I wanna start complainin, coz i'm the first to complain when it actually is hot, so hot that you can't even leave your house for fear of melting.  oh well.......make the most of it.

      Well well well, there is a new feature @ Maybe I'll Go Blind, and that is the 'Comments', if you've got something to say about anything written here but can't be bothered or think its not worthy of doing a whole new post about it, simply click the 'comments' link below each post.  BIG WELCOME TO PICHE!!! I heard thru the grapevine that you've been gymming it, me too, its tops! I love it!  And in other news, as most people know there's nothing I like better than being a girl's first pash with a girl. So the challenge is set: If Prue hasn't copped a dirty pash by Midnight next Sunday then its on for young n old, she not only has to  pash me but Gardiner as well (man that should be amusing). There. It has been set in stone (or blog if you will) and there's no backing out now Tehan!

      I hope everyone's real well. just managed to find something resembling an internet connection. It's sometime in the mid afternoon. I haven't spoken to a single person for over 48 hours. I'm sitting in a house in Byron Bay in the middle of what one might call a writing bender having written more stuff (I'm gonna call it stuff for now) in the last three days then I have in the last twelve monthes. Who knows wether it's all a pile of horse shit but for better worse at least it's all on tape. I have to be honest at this point and say that finishing a bottle of bombay by myself has put me in a bit of a reflective mood but to quote people with no other cliche's to string together, It's all good.   I've decided that there is absolutely nothing better in the world than to sit and hear nothing. Not traffic, not conversation, not even music. If you wanna clear your head then I highly recommend it, it's just a little hard to organise. I'm starting to appreciate what all these tibetan monks are banging on about - I'm probably the most unelightened person going round but this is as close to meditation as I'm likely to get. Then again those guys spend more time chanting in orange robes achieving a state of perfect nirvana and less time at the bottom of a bottle of gin writing songs.   One thing I've realised in the last couple of days about myself is that I have some fucking amazing friends in my life and Erin, if you're out there baby, you top the list. love ya girl. That's probably enough mush, i'm ending this utterly pointless blog before I read it back and decide not to post. love to you all  p.s Miranda when you get to melbourne I want a poodle kiss, only had one in my life and it was a high-light... Plus you're my secret crush!

      I'd just like to point out how ridiculously far-fetched NW (Australia's fav mag)'s random celeb pic captions are:  1. Standard Jennifer Aniston holding her cell-phone pic. Caption:   'Am ovul8ing! B home soon!' Jennifer Aniston sends an SMS to Brad Pitt outside the SNL studio in New York    ...offensive and outrageous!  2. Photo of Diana Ross holding a stack of about 4 newspapers. Caption:   Is Diana Ross planning to open a fish and chip shop?   ... just plain stupid  3. Mandy Moore standing with her arms firmly by her sides. Caption:   Mandy Moore suddenly remembers she forgot to wax her underarms at the Chasing Liberty premiere in LA    Who the hell writes this shit and why doesn't Laurie D have their job?

      yo yo yo......  My eyes have been opened to a whole new world: that is the cultural backwater of 1992 i.e: GEELONG NIGHTLIFE.  Although the Nash, where we started was quite a cool little place, a pub that I would probably frequent if it was close to where I live. However as the hours went on, the crowd became skankier.... a strange mix of hippy freaks, 18 year old shouting out each other's names in the toilets..... Noni shouting out people's names in the toilets..... glass smashing, sleazy guys who think its ok to stare at a girls breasts 1/2 a metre away...... but this was the best establishment......... it was downhill from there. I had the pleasure of entering the much talked about 'People's Pub' words cannot describe how hideous this place is. Oh the fashion... oh lordy lord the fashion. Christina traindriver hats circa 98, 'rave pants' (!!), mullets, long blonde ponytails (on guys), visable g-strings, homie pants (!!!), the list goes on.    God knows why we didn't get home til 5am, but least I can say that I am now fully educated in the ways of the Long of Gee, a huge thank you to Noni for 're-arranging her evening for me' and showing me a really good time and for dancing with a 60+ old guy for our amusement, and for the inflatable bed, and thank you to Glen for the dirty pash and the near verbal abuse from his boyf directed at we 3 girls who you forced to pash you!!! (I love you baby.... don't drink so much!).  A tops Victorian night really.    SHAYNE!!!  where the hell are you? Are you avoiding me? and are you still coming to Melbs? and are you ever going to call me back?

      Ok , I'm going away fro a week so don't be expecting me to put out on the blog front fer a while. Just gotta say I can't wait for Panda, shayne and all you other perthonalities to get yer buts down to melbourne soon. Can't wait to see you gang.  This week was going to be about new years resolutions but I've come to realise that NY reso's are a crock of shit and that I can go about improving myself anytime of the year. or maybe I'm just procrastinating. Or maybe I'm just perfect already and no improvements are possible. Or maybe not.  Question of the day to fellow citizens of Australia: Are we still at war with Iraq? I'm pretty sure we joined a war, did it finish officially? with a big closing ceremony? Or did it just peter out like a game of monopoly? Why did we go again? My memory is pretty hazy and it seems everyone elses is too...

      what's happened to team melbourne are you all yet to resurface from the farewell gig at the Army on Tuesday night? blog very quiet, maybe people in serious holiday mode and things like computars have slid into irrelevance........ hope all are well, have heard the old crowded house "four seasons in one day" is very applicable for melb at the mo, you kids should get your gear back to sunny west coast, 30 degrees clear skies, sunny and g+t on tap.......that bit not quite true but i could probably organise it given the challenge.

      hi to all, espesh to Erin who i still have not called back.  Just wanted you to know that it isn't due to lack of want, but I have been under the hammer a little this week and keep finding myself getting up at 6am and falling asleep moments after i walk thru the door at home sometime late in the evening.  I'm sorry babe...  So i've been re-embracing health, with a return to the gym and and a total change in eating styles.  I actually love it and already feel a lot better after just one week.  So yeah... i realize now reading the last couple sentences that they are about as interesting as socks, or an empty salsa jar, or one of those zoo exhibits where the animal is asleep up the back, just out of view.  ERIN, THERE IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL...  Love to all

      spanner that was a terrific stream of conciousness. I think drunk blogs should now be cumpolsory. Make it your routine now people! - get incredibly drunk - possibly pick up - get home at 4am - Tell less-than-significant other you'll come to bed soon - switch on computer - bare soul - possibly live to regret what you write but who cares  Yes, yes yes! Next time i'm pissed this is what I'm doing.  In other news, I joined a gym (I know this is almost as weird as erin working out). And I am involved with absolutely no girls at all, not even a little bit, and this is good. And I'm watching the led zep DVD which is just the most inspiring thing ever. 5 1/2 hours of the greatest band ever shot from live footage in their prime. My jaw is aching from sitting on the floor. Guy, Laurie hope you had a good NYE. I am SO sorry that you rocked my party a) just as I was leaving and b) when there were only 15 meat-head footy-player types to entertain you. Heard you went on to a glam rock party so I hope that was better. My party did improve, Erin even picked up! (obligatory and mandatory deluxe reference here).  See y'all soon  das furze

      something in my pea- sized brain thought it would a good time to blog even though i am so drunk i can't see the screen and keep laughing at danny deckchair playing in the next room. but i am not so hammered that i cant work out that the last lot of film based blogs are way to interlectual to read in this state of mind, thanks for making me feel retarded erin, maybe that was the thirty beers i drank since two pm. for those who cant work out saqrcasm i havent really drunk thirty that was just a ball park figure. okay so nothing to say, it is hot in perth i feel like someone has dunked my head in a keg and i need a shower so love to all my bloggin buddies, ill have something better to chime about next time, although not likely, but to finish on a good note, ill end with and oldy but a goody, see you round like an orange, or a tennis ball, or any any ball or anything that is round, okay you get it, me to bed ciao the spanner xoxox

      Poodle I'm not really all that concerned about you I just think you might have left your brain @ 93 Walcott St, or more likely at uni, I think you better go pick it up!  Anyways, I dunno whats with me and films at the moment, there's just so many I wanna see and I keep gettin real excited about them and then ultimately feeling let down when I see em. Like tonight I went and saw  'Lost in Translation' , I can honestly say it did very little for me, most of the time I was actually quite bored, although its quite often visually beautiful and the storyline is a little unusual but ultimately predictable. I certainly don't see why people have put it in their top films of the year....... I dunno I guess I'm just very easily bored these days... its really taking a lot to interest me.  Needless to say, it was infinitely better than  Dogville , and Peaches was on the soundtrack....excellent.

      oh....my....god...i sit here now, eating my once a year burger (first one of the year and i think the only thing i have eaten in the last 4 days) and reflect on my new years eve that seems to have lasted for four days!!!  I dont think i have ever had such a great time in all my life!!  Spending nye at my sisters house in ml was fabo....playing cards with piche, shayne, little sis and a handful of her mates, tom (wasted on acid), and having shots of schnapps in between beers and gin.  although i went to bed around 3 it was a great night, and i made sure i let everyone know and that i love them (poodle style, with many poodle kisses).  But nothing was to prepare me for the day that lay ahead at the perth cup!  On erin's recommendation i'm going to list the days events in point form.....and believe me, i dont think ive ever been so drunk or pathetic in all my life!!  -i went up to a man and tried to pull his hair off after telling him his wig was hilarious (which wasnt a wig) then nearly got bashed by his mega fat girlfriend who thought i was trying to snog him -agreed to let some people try and pole-vault over the top of me with a flag pole they had found -asked security "what seemed to be the problem" when they banned us from playing the pole vaulting game -pashed a tomato farmer who was dressed up as steve irwin who had a blow up croc and kangaroo -also kissed the blow up kangaroo when dared to (i'm totally serious) -pashed a hot 19 year old and told him he was allowed to put his hand on my ass -asked a stack of really tall guys if they were jockeys -pulled up a guys kilt and then started laughing hysterically at the freckles all over his ass and yelling it to everyone around me - thought it was 8 in the morning when it was 8 at night and freaking out the sun was coming up, when it in fact was going down! I'm sure there was more, but i cant recall.  All this my friends, after about 3/4 bottles of champas, which i started drinking at 9am.  Since then i have been continuously drinking beer in my sisters blow up kiddie pool and last night consumed many cosmopolitans at leons porch party where we played dress ups, then went out, and i got in at 5:30 this morning.   Jesus Christ hey The end. ps erin...dont be concerned about me....im still poodle...i think i just got raybees for a while!

      Ok, I feel that I NEED to blog about  DOGVILLE .  In the car on the way home I was thinking about my immediate reaction of it being 'REVOLTING AND STUPID' and began to realise what that might mean.  Having never been physically shaken by a film, I sit here nearly an hour later with jittery fingers and a lingering sickness in the pit of my stomach. I can't help but wonder if this is the same reaction that the audience and viewers of shunned art of the past had.  To quote the film 'Basquiat', "Nobody wants to be part of a generation who ignores another Van Gogh... you better pay attention, you might be staring at [his] ear".... with this in mind its quite comforting to know that most of the time, the artists and 'intellectuals' of this world are constantly looking out for each other by appearing to fully understand their work and immediately crowning it as a 'masterpiece'. Without having read any reviews about Dogville nor having known anything about it before I went in, I have no doubt that this is what a lot of critics would have done. Personally I think this film is a pile of over-crammed horseshit tightly packed into a minimalist 'theatre' (oh so credible) set, with an emphasis on often conflicting theories of humanity. Now the amount of spelling/grammar mistakes in this paragraph alone probably points out that I'm not smart enough or 'in touch with humanity' to understand/appreciate this film, and I may very well have been staring at Van Gogh's ear, but I am unashamed to admit this and I only wish that all who were involved in the production of this film would have the good humour to do the same.   Having just written all this, if I were another person reading it, it would probably make me wanna go and see it, do as you will people but don't say I didn't warn ya.

      okay - new years eve sins grand total = zero. had basically boring evening at a house party with the beautiful people of perth sipping champers. i obviously was drinking blue absolut vodka forty percent alcohol or whatever it is to try and combat the fact everyone around me looked like they had walked out of cosmopolitan magazine, and some even like a centrefold from UK vogue but you get the gist.  I got a major gripe here - music at house parties. now im fairly easy going when it comes to what noise passes past in my audible vacinity, but........ what i hate is when a couple of drunk booze hags decide they are DJ and their two favourite tracks, which at this party were Pink-  god is a Dj, and outkast whatever that song is called, are played on repeat with hideous dance moves to accompany and insipid giggling/ attempts to sing along. so yes any chance of music actually settling the mood for being somewhere pleasant was banished at this point.   but, there were sparklers for which i am a bit of a sucker, and this year i actually managed to hold one without burning the shirt of any unsuspecting guy i was trying to disco pash like my effort last year. so basically, new years eve sins kept to an absolute minimum ie none, it was bad music, mutton dressed as lamb and a boyfriend at some bar in fitzroy VICTORIA so not even a cheeky pash at midnight. blah, 363 sleeps til i can do it all again.

      hmmmmmm.  Furze, there will be no mention of the 'D word' ever again. It had to be done sooner or later and now its outta my system.......................... WAY outta my system.  And no, he didn't run into Grog but in the split second it wold have taken him to run accross my front lawn and the hell away from my house my Mother managed to see him, and then asked me last night 'Erin, was that Steve running out of the house this morning? Yknow, I don't want people to think that you sleep around...'   Now that is priceless.     And come to think of it I did endure quite a few Barbies at your party bitching about what other Barbie you may have disappeared with... twas quite amusing really.   Well its been nice catching up with the Geelong kids in the last 24 hours, and Noni, I take it back, Geelong is quite large and confusing so I will grant it the title of being a 'city' ... I was just used to driving right through it so I never realised how big it really is.

      OK, so is it actually possible to plan a 33hr house party or does it just organically evolve as people realise they have the stamina and the substances to push right on through. I can't believe how big the last 2 days have been. For me it was like a cleansing ritual, where you push yourself to the absolute limit, knowing you'll crash hard eventually, only to sleep for 12 hours and begin a saner, healthier life.   One thing I know for sure - there are no longer any complicated women issues in my life. This is an inevitable outcome when you hold a massive house party which they all spontaneously attend, and shortly after all decide simultaneously that you are a two-timing, philandering man-whore and storm out one by one. So I only have one new years resolution, to stay completely away from anything resembling a relationship. And should I break this resolution by falling in love it shall change to putting everything into making it work. Why did all this have to happen on a come down??!!  Question of the party: "Where's Tucker? Hang on... Where's Erin??!!!"  Deluxe at last...priceless  Pity he didn't run into grog...HA!

      I think my body is failing me also.....i keep just randomly losing my balance, getting sharp pains in my ribs and hyperventilating....? what the hell is wrong with me?  It could be the same thing thats wrong with erin, considering we've been doing exactly the same things for two weeks (apart from her getting up at seven and going to tafe, and me staying in bed or going to sit in a dark theatre for 7 hours), but apart from that, we have both indulged in many a g&t/beer/vodka/punch/anything alcoholic, and arrived home far too late.  It's actually pathetic of me to wonder why i dont feel 100%, my body has once again become a temple of shame due to my lack of ownership over it.  I mean if i grasped the fact that i am my body and not just my brain, maybe i would feel a little less rotten!!!  Anyway i'm beginning to confuse myself now....! Welcome dearest Leon to the wonderful world of blog, glad to hear you are attempting a new career in the land of soft furnishings! You never cease to amaze me!

      Crikey, the blog reall is pumpin! and just when we're approaching his first lil birthday.......awwwwww.  Ok Furze, and anybody else who saw or is going to see Bowie, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW! Ok? Not that I could have gone anyway as I am currently enduring the 3rd day of my mega migraine.............. oh the pain. Once again my body finds a way of making me slow down and quit abusing it... stupid body.... JUST KEEP UP WITH ME ALRIGHT!  A sure sign of this was sitting in the Palais, St Kilda (one of my favourite places in the world) ready to see Ani DiFranco, and then simply getting up and leaving due to the fact that my head was about to implode. I was actually in so much pain that it took me an hour to drive from St Kilda to East Malvern, because I simply was not capable of using my brain. Ok so I drink way to much, and pretty much on a nightly basis, and usually get about 3 to 4 hours sleep a night, and then get up and go to Tafe where I force myself to 'learn things' so I don't think the brain's coping too well with this. Ah well.... better go get drunk again tonight,.... I dont wanna go SHOCKING my body as well! cheerio!  ps- good to see the ol' leon-peeon-putacupofteaon on the da blog. welcome noodle.

      ANDREW!!!!!!  YOU   MUST   READ   "PATTERN   RECOGNITION"   BY    WILLIAM    GIBSON  This book is a remarkably rich and detailed observation of our times, all bound in a wonderfully melancholic work of fiction that will resonate deeply with any one of the people who contribute to this blog.  I read it.  I loved it.  It felt like someone was finally telling the truth.

      Has anyone read any good books lately? I'm nearly through my stack and I'm looking to expand my mind a little fom back isssues of "Rolling Stone". Eleanor, Guy, I'm looking at you guys here. Maybe reccommend me a modern masterpiece involving an exerstentialist exploration of one girls journey through relationships and womenhood, set in the depression and full of pathos. Or maybe just throw me the latest Tom Clancy schlock.  Saw David Bowie last night. If I was to blog about it here I would turn into a disgusting, dribbling fanboy and you guys don't want to read any more gushing, psuedo-muso-criticism wanking. Let's just say it was Bowie and it was special.  I've been reading a few other aussie blogs and I have to say (with a little pride) that this blog is kind of unique with the sheer amount of bloggers and the sheer amount of distance between them. It's been a forum for thoughts on life, a chance to vent your spleen, a messaging board and even a meeting point service for overseas travel. I'm glad this blog is still raging. May it prosper for at least another year. Also at the blog homepage it's worth checking out the "Best of British Blogging" link. Some very funny shit.  Funny word of the day: Trouser

      Random Rock events of the week: Firstly Fleetwood mac were amazing on monday night. Performing for over 2 and a half hours and playing pretty much everything you could hope to hear, including "landslide" (if anyone posts to query why Fleetwood mac were doing a Dixie Chicks song - unforgivable. If anyone posts to ask why they were doing a smashing pumpkins song - eventually forgivable). Lindsay Buckingham was simply amazing and I still have my 17 Years old crush on stevie nicks.  Anyway last night I came within a meter or two of one of my biggest idols, always a very strange and surreal experience. The thin white duke himself, David Bowie, was playing Rove so of course it was audience tickets and a wander backstage after. It is impossible to underestimate this guys influence on popular music, and impossible to underestimate the sheer weight of personality, intelligence and presence he brings to the room. Any further proof was supplied later when Erin and panda discussing how they'd jump his almost-60-year-old bones in a flash. He even said goodbye to us as he walked out. Disgusting how I'm turning into fan-boy here but, hey, it was David Bowie. And he wore a silver suit!  Ani Defranco gig tonight, huge night for melbourne's lesbian poulation. Bowie at Rod Laver on Thursday. Oh and superjesus are guest DJing at the Rock Room tonight (Tim just called me and asked if they could use my records...shit). I'm playing after them at 12 so come down and see superjesus be my support act! hehehehe.... If beck reads this I'm definetly having a crack at sarah...

      okay so that isnt going to work because it is very childish, and to be honest perth was never going to dominate melb in anything, except maybe the weather but that old chestnut who really cares? buy a jumper if you are cold....... and hasn't ninety percent of this blogging population attended an Arts institution sometime over the last fours years and thus have some comprehension of how disorganised and generally retarded the admin and the oraganisation of simple happenings can be when put in the hands of "creatives"......the now hunted down stage manager of tropfest and her apparently appauling skills in her area of less than expertise should hardly come to us as a surprise. People who organise football best and fairest etc are focused, schedule- mad beings who live for order, note-taking and matter-of-fact conversation. THese people not only had creativity by-passed at their birth but personalties too. was that too mean - sorry, i love a snag on the barbie and a good perv at a less than attractive stripper in the footy locker room. spanner

      I must admit I did find it a tad odd that random HUGE celebs were casual strolling onto the stage clutching umbrellas and soggy envelopes at Tropfest. I mean, Jesus Christ, it was possibly the most poorly organised and executed awards ceremony in history, I mean I've seen football club best and fairest awards running smoother than that. Lets just say whoever the stage manager was should be shot. All 12 or 16 (whatever) director finalists (including Alyssa acted like her usual self being completely wasted,  falling all over Adam and talking in mega bogan accent) had to stand in pouring rain (enduring many a 'wet tshirt comp' gag) while the host frantically stalled whilst results were being counted, then they bust out the big gun celebs to present (one of whom didn't actually appear, can't remember who it was but probably threw a diva tantrum about walking out in rain....rightly so) then out comes Alan Cummings, Selma Hayek, Josh Lucas blah blah blah plus the usual aussies Claudia Karvan, Mary Coustas etc. But that really was a little strange; it was almost as if they happened to be walking by and somebody's gone 'Hey!! You're Selma Hayek!" then chloroformed her and pushed her onto a rain drenched stage.   Ah well, the world works in mysterious ways.

      oh yeah... and of the last 18 posts on this blog - 9 were from perth, 8 were from melbourne and 1 was from somewhere in the US (Hi Anna, maybe catch you in the phillipines). Not too bad from the melbournites, although I've been pretty slack and we just picked up panda as well. hmm some healthy competition wouldn't be too bad...

      Shayne they were excellent questions, deserving of a well thought out response. So well done Erin and here's my trollop 5 cents worth.  1) Bucket really is a good name, full of humour and pathos (one night at tropfest and now I'm using words like these). But if I changed my name to Bucket tomorrow, the fact that noone has ever known me has bucket would have wide-ranging implications. Like the fact that people trying to find me would now have to look up "Bucket" in the phone book. And I'd have to ask the 8 or so stand-up comedians in my office to seriously refer to me as "Bucket". And I've developed a strange attachment to my sir name, what with my proud family war history and all, so giving that up is going to be emotionally tough. Then again, I'm going overseas so i need some cash. "Bucket" it is for $2000 in a paper bag.  2) Time travel to any significant event in history? It would have to be either a) the assasination of julius ceasar, b) the fall of Robespierre and the french revolution or c) Hendrix at Woodstock   3) 5 CD's to take back to the birthplace of civilisation - 1) Gustav Holst - The Planets Suites - 2) Led Zeppelin IV - 3) Louis Armstrong - Greatest Hits - 4) The Beatles - Rubber Soul - 5)  Electric 6 - Fire  4) TV show resurrection? I want new "Goodies" episodes and the return of the "A" team.  5) Being invisible would be awesome! That'd be a busy week... Monday - Go to white house and spend day in oval office observing the world's most powerful and incompetent man at the peak of his powers. Release potentially criminal findings to the world media in niave hope that US citizens will wake up to themselves. Tuesday - Playboy mansion Wednesday - Streak through Manchester United - Arsenal game in front of 39,000 people. Realise that doing this invisble isn't quite as gutsy. Thursday - Spend the day randomly kicking Millsy in the balls. Friday - Sneak on a flight to Perth, plant large quantities of gay porn in basil zemplis's news desk, make anonymous call to Channel 7 Perth management. Sit back with 6 pack of Little Creatures and watch Perth's sleaziest b-grade celebrity try to convince the public he's straight Saturday - Spend the day perving on the female members of Hi-5 Sunday - Take a steamer on John Howards desk minutes before a meeting with foriegn dignitarys  That about covers it. Yes the tropfest winner was bullshit. Yes it is completely F$%#cked when big hollywood studios fuck with something as iconic as a 70 year old cartoon. Yes it's a slow day in the office today...

      i knew tropfest was big, but am i right in seeing salma hayek and josh lucas walking down a red carpet at the event? or have i channel hoped between entertainment news too quickly too many times? isn't tropfest like three million struggling artists/ film-makers sitting in a park debating super 8 cameras and functional design????? not a night out in down-town hollywood sipping champers and showing off the 2005 collette dinnigan collection? maybe i'm a bit perth naive and a bit out of the arts indo loop, but hey am just throwing it out there.......also erin can you please debrief on the drunken inappropriateness of elissa down at the event.  ps what"s wrong with idol? isn't it the most democratic way to find the most talented and musically creative people in australia? that's what channel ten told me.  pps if anyone saw american idol last night can it please be confirmed that those eight singers were by far the shittest karoke efforts ever, a dying cat yelping at a can of snappy tom would have sounded better than all of them.

      Well I think its safe to say that this is a Perth blog, it used to be quite balanced but then more and more melbies started dropping off now its leaning very heavily towards the west. However I'd still like to think of it as the link between coasts.................. as soon you shall all be moving to Melbourne/Sydney at some stage.... hahahahaha! you know it.  Anyways, random things I've learnt in the past couple of weeks: a) David Bowie is the smartest man alive, or at least the smartest person in the music industry. b) Australian Idol is EVEN MORE of a sham than I thought!!!!! c) Feminists really fucking piss me off in a MAJOR way d) My ear really hurts, and I fear it shall hurt forever e) The pros and cons of various piercings  f) The winning film at Tropfest was a pile of shit g) My course is 75% sham, keeping up the tradition of all TAFE courses. good work.  Fleetwood Mac tonight!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!

      oh man! Shayne you're always making me use my brain so much! Ok here's me answers:  1) I'd need at least a couple of million, therefore I would be famous anyway for having been paid a rediculous amount of money to change my name, and I kinda like the sound of 'bucket' plus after i have my millions and short-lived fame, it opens up marketing opportunities with BUCKET (TM.) Ah what a beautiful world we live in.  2) The extinction of the Mc Feast  3) Oh man this is too hard.... Oh but of course I'd pretend to be a god wit my boom box and you know it! (shayne did you have me in mind when you wrote that?) Ok I'll give it a go..... this is only a rough draft.... 1. The Holy Bible - Manic Street Preachers (that's possibly all anyone would need to beware of the evils humanity contains) 2.  The White Album - The Beatles 3. Something epic and classical, Mozart, Beethoven blah blah blah 4. Elvis Greatest Hits 5. "Sweatin to the Oldies volumes 1,2 and 4!!"  4) oooooohhh um 'You can't do that on Television', 'The Young Ones', 'Bottom', That hilarious soft porn series hosted by David Duchovny(Red something diaries), ....... um 'SIENFELD' for the love of god.......................reunite............please!!!!!!  5) oh baby, I'd be hangin in a lotta locker-rooms, showers, bathrooms, bedrooms, basically anywhere where people might be naked .... um jump on a shit load of planes and travel.......................oh this is only for one day. right....

      Hannah, it must be BUCKET.  It has a particular relevence to the hypothical nature of the question because it has to be hypothetical!~! People already call you Spannah and there is nothing hypothetical about that....  Nuff said  Lets grab a bite some time, i'm really bored lately...

      where does one come up with these ideas shayne? i thought i had a few screws loose upstairs but the whole Bucket thing is verging on bizarre, what if i changed my name to Spanner permantly?or maybe THE SPANNER. does that count? they are both inanimate objects, and both would cause serious amounts of confused looks from bank tellers when you went to open a new account.......  am just going to go to flower shop and think about all the places i would rather be in an invisble state hmmmmm the possibilities are endless, and so cheeky!

      it's really quiet... I've gotten into the habit of getting up at like 5.30 in the morning.  I am starting to love the peace and quiet at this time.  HYPOTHETICAL Question TIME  1. How much money would you need to change your name by deedpoll forever to "BUCKET"? (Keep in mind that this is forever and you don't get a surname ie.If your original name was erin buntine, your new name would not be Bucket Buntine (although that has got a ring to it) it would just be BUCKET.)  2. If you could time travel to change one significant event in history what would it be and why?  3. If you could time travel (i know, I know!) back to the beginning of civilization and you could take five CD's with you to influence the developement of culture and society which 5 would you take? (and would you pretend to be a god with your boom box?)  4. If you had the power to bring any TV show back from the oblivion of cancellation, which show would you save?  5. You are invisible for a day, how do you make use of/exploit this phenomenon?

      oohhhhhhh shayne.....i miss you!!!!! Even if you are a racist bastard! (only jokes).  Well i have nearly been in the big smoke a whole week, and it feels like a year! I've socialised, been to the movies, got a virus and thrown up for a whole night and been bedridden the whole next day, watched 6 dvds, been for a job interview and gone to erin's gig.....phew.  I start at mtc on tuesday where i'm assistant to the director (chezza) on The Glass Menagerie (stars include Ben Mendelson, Pia Miranda, Tim Write/Right? and some others) for a week and am also doing research for the next show.  All is good apart from being a little homesick and missing all you guys, and erin not recognising me at the airport....yes it's true....she stared blankly at me as i approached her, and even when i was right infront of her face saying "HIIIIIII Pooooodle!!!" she just stared and finally came out with "You look different". Hilarious!!!! Oh Well.  Many hugs and kisses to all Perth Babies, and to all melbournites for being so welcoming.

      what the fuck is wrong with the world???  McG is a Director (Charlies Angels 1 + 2), he is currently attched to direct the up and coming SUPERMAN movie for Warner Brothers (a form of evil only surpassed by Disney).  Now, I have been fairly supportive of this guy, in fact some of you may be surprised that i didn't mind Charlies Angles, his first film (DISCLAIMER: I only liked it for the fluff that it was plus an odd and occaisionally lingering childhood love of Drew Barrymore). I loathed his second film but had highish hopes for the rebirth of The Last Son of Krypton on the big screen.  Now to get to my point, this asshole thinks that it would be cool to cast Beyonce Knowles as Lois Lane..........................................??????????????????????????????  WHAT THE FUCK!!!!  LOIS LANE IS WHITE!!!  LOIS LANE IS INTELLIGENT!!!   LOIS LANE DOESN"T SHAKE HER BOOTY!!!  Now this may seem kinda inconsequential to some people. However I feel that when you (Mcg and Warner Brothers) are translating one of the most recognizable Modern Cultural Icons, who has eighty years of history and a white girl friend, you would,  even just out of respect, LEAVE HIS GIRLFRIEND WHITE!!!  When will those Warner Motha Fuckers learn.   Treat your licenses and properties with fucking respect and you will make a fuck load of money and earn lots of respect yourself. You have already destroyed BATMAN, The Flash, and the soon to be released trainload of shit with no brakes that is CATWOMAN.   NOW GIVE ME THE SUPERHERO MOVIES I WANNA SEE.  BTW, I am not a racist.

      Attended Australian premiere of "One Perfect Day" last nite with the panda and the poodle. It's a new aussie flick starring whats-his-face from "secret lice of puss" (surprisingly I don't mean samuel johnson). It's a look at one young classical composer's entry into rave culture via his departed OD'ing sister. Very hip, very now, very 1998. Now with the likes of Shayne blogging on this here bloggy blog I am very reluctant to attempt any sort of cinematic deconstruction. However the concensus was that for a film that profers to "break all the rules", the only rules it seemed to break were those of logical, well-paced script writing and editing.   But what really sticks out about this movie is the exploration of a melbourne rave scene that doesn't really exist, or at least hasn't for quite a while. Melbourne is in the grips of what could only be described as a rock revolution (Melbourne venues are now scampering to put bands back ON the stage) and in 2004 here comes this movie to the cinemas like a mature-age student to a keg party in happy pants.  I couldn't help thinking "Guy's Melbs hasn't had a full-time rave scene since the summer of cargos, boobtubes and the first delirium album. Did someone forget to mention that ROCK IS BACK!!" Mind you, they probably conceived this movie in 1997 and knowing the australian film industry it took them seven years to get it off the ground. It just seemed unfortunetly irrelevant.  Still most amazing of all was the fact that spanda, ezla and myself were so tired we turned down a  free-booze after-party . This is actually historically the first incidence ever of Erin turning down a free drink and, like Haley's comet, we are unlikely to see it again in our lifetimes. Missy G&T, what's happening to you?

      so that is quite a party recipe team........ my weekend of selling roses to wanky consumers on val day is looking a little too wholesome in comparison about now.  did get to go on what to my memory is my first real valentine's dinner date. awesome food and a shit load of delicious wine made it quite super really, and of course my date was there too.... but mmm the food. anyway was followed by more boozin with general crew and illegal drunk dancin APU.....but was sitting at this funky bar/ resturant with tables only set for two and was thinking that had i by chance wandered into this establishement without a partner by my side and looked at all the nauseating lovers eating with only a fork so they could still hold hands at the same time, that i would probably want to hang myself on the spot. anyway am glad that hideously commercial day created only for florists like myself to benefit from is over for another year, so now people can feel at ease to tell someone they love them, or not, without reading it off a halmark card and nervously thinking they may get dumped if they choose the wrong heart shaped hellium balloons or toy monkey with heart shaped ears.....  ps hope no-one got given that toy monkey i just described, think it would look very ugly and efforts to pretend you actually liked it might take close to an oscar award winning performance........xox spanner

      Ok, so the 'fuck-off' party and the week of Erin's birthday has finally come to an end. And what a fuck-off party it was. Let's check out the rough estimate of the recipe: 18 bottles of vodka 8 bottles of bombay gin 6 bottles of cointreau 40 litres of cranberry juice 3 boxes of mini water bottles 8 cartons of beer 3 cases of champagne 12 bottles of wine a shitload of lime juice (an essential for the cosmo fountain) a shitload of various mixers and a frightfull crapload of explicit drugs  throw in the fact that due to Grove the amazing superstar driver, absolutely nobody was driving, things got real REAL messy.  But hey the word of the evening was 'EXCESS' and thats certainly what it was, I have only just worked up the brainpower to write about it, and already I'm slowing down. I'm sending my dearest love and speedy recovery to those who fell victim to excessive consumption, and I hope everybody had an awesome time. Oooh and I especially hope that we created a few new valentines along the way! (Tehan I'm looking in your direction) cheers bros

      Really hope we haven't built this party up to much (although I doubt that it's possible). It's feeling to me at the moment like on one of those teen movies where the whole movie is based around one party like "she's all that" or "dazed and confused". Cue deep american voiceover..."It's the last night of school, and for these teenagers everything is about to change..."

      well my anxiety has now peaked into whimpering and involuntary, spasmodic crying over silly things like huggies adds or neighbours..... i'm scared to leave!!! and i love my friends too much...here come the tears again....probably going to short circuit mum and dads computer!!  Just wanted to let all the most amazing perthonalities know that my heart is going to crack and bleed for you all as i fly out of perth in a stinky red tube in the sky on friday morning.  I know i will be back in may for a quick visit, but i've grown so accustomed to having so many people around who i can be totally myself with...and that means saying things without thinking about them first (Shayne...."what do you mean UPstairs?" "what do you mean SWITCH?").... Other people are going to think me disabled!!!!!  Melbournites, i'm going to need a bit of tlc, erin...be prepared for a panda eyed poodle!! If anyone reads before wednesday...come to scottsman and give me a hug goodbye...i'll try not to cry on you! Poodle kisses to Everyone and loads of too tight hugs aswell ps Thanks Hannybabes!  Hope to see ya on wednesday! pps Shayne, lets get that long distance 'mobile movie' thing happening, where we will end up talking about a green pixel for hours!!!

      hello true believers  Okay... I have two bits o good news and one bit o bad news. (bad for me mostly tho)  BAD NEWS IS... I wont be making it over on friday for the party.  I just can't afford the time off work, or to be a salivating, dirty, mess of a human being on Monday.   There is another very important reason that isn't really cool for me to blog so ezzy, i'll tell you that one later.  GOOD NEWS IS... that I have finally emerged from my wierd, summer, introvertive, exile. I have missed you all and wont be abandoning my friends or the blog again for the forseeable future.  AND... I will definately be over there in mid april for a week and I will book the flight on thursday.  I gotta get to bed.    Love to all.  FURZE: Lost in Translation is supreme, you have impecable taste man.  ERIN: You are beautiful (and twisted and dangerous and exhilarating) and I love you. MIRANDA: I had fun with you  tonight. Perth will be so lost without you.  nuff said

      have just returned from great weekend on the east coast, which basically involved the meet and greet of James' family as well as his entire group of friends.....but think i fooled them all into believing i was cool/ friendly/ funny, and tried to refrain from too many inappropriate Spannerism jokes. Cheers to buntine and furze for taking me out on a rock tour of melb bars. think the last round of vodkas deffinately kicked in on the way back to punt road, god knows how i managed to direct the driver let alone recognise james' house.........was lovely to see you both. anyway am now back at the flower shop, and am thinking i am quietly content with the way things are cruising along at the mo, hoping to keep this little bit of normality going for a little while longer.  good luck for friday poodle, know you have got quite an amazing night ready for you on arrival. safe travels if i don't see you before departure........go fly that design flag for us girl.

      hey kiddies...  WHOA el quieto on the bloggo.  Well, I started tafe today and boy oh boy, I really don't think I was quite ready for it. I mean I was greatly looking forward to being able to use my brain again to some capacity but I don't think I was quite prepared for all those 'deadlines' and 'research' and 'homework' and 'assessments' .... you see I've grown accustomed to using my noggan only when I kinda feel up to it and when there's no pressure from anybody else so this is a bit of a shock to the system.  Plus  to my dismay, it was nothing like SCHOOL OF ROCK and Jack Black certainly did not make an appearance, that doesn't mean that there wasn't an array of very similarly bitter, overweight failed musicians for lecturers.  The students themselves generally are surprisingly very cool. There are however a small group of blonde hair, acrylic nails 'I work at metros' 18 year olds which the rest of the class have made a silent pact to ignore. The rest actually have some pretty substantial rock-cred and are also pretty funny dudes. During the initial 'tell us who you are and what are you doing here rounds', one of them actually had the guts to say 'Well, I wanted to be a rock star, but I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be, so I'd really just like to hang around them' which is of course why everybody was there but didn't have the balls to admit it.  Anyways, got a feeling its gonna be a funny year with this mob, it should be equally funny seeing how I go academically.

      I fear I might actually  love  ROCKROOM. I mean, I am there every week it seems, regardless of whether I'm working or not.  But its everything I could ever possibly want in a bar! Awesome music, free/cheap drinks, hot bartenders (and djs...), and friendly drunken people to dance with!!!! Its like some extreme bonus when I'm sitting there wasted and someone hands me an envelope with a few fifties in it for 'working' the week before! hey hey hey! What more can ya want??  I love it, I love it, I love it, gold, gold, gold.

      yes... where the hell  IS  Shayne...?  Anyways, I've just had a little check up on the amazing German Hurricane/Southside Festivals... and although the English version of the website is under construction, my extremely bad German managed to make out that the confirmed bands for this year so far are: DAVID BOWIE, PLACEBO,  PIXIES, THE HIVES, LIFE OF AGONY, BEGINNER, SPORTFREUNDE STILLER,  THE (INTERNATIONAL) NOISE CONSPIRACY,  DIE HAPPY, BEATSTEAKS, FÜNF STERNE DELUXE and DANKO JONES.  Hmmm. nothin's really shakin my snake yet apart from T.(I).N.C , they would be fuckin cool to see live and I damn well missed them last time they toured Oz.  So at least I ain't missin out on much ......yet...... this is only about a quarter of the full line-up....grrrr.  Anyways, it seems the little Spannah Etho is in ol' Melbourne town and I'm tres excited! Time to get Rock n Roll wasted!

      well. well, .....after all this time ......where the hell is shayne???? Shayne???? Where are you???? i miss you terribly......i also have come to the conclusion that most rok stars are absoute fucking numbskulls that think themselves amazing BUT ARE"NT!!!! I mean there are a lot of people that can write great stuff.. it is truly sad that people become so disillusioned that they believe they are better than others because they can write a good song.  Everything has it's place and everyone is important.   Sorry, but that is my vibe at the moment.  On a different note.................................. how exciting i am making the move in 10 days!!!!! Cant wait to see buntine, lori, guy, kate, bridget, and yummy furze!!!!!! Poodle...I HAVENT SEEN YOU IN SOOOOOO LONG! AMAZING!!!!!!!C YA LL SOON XOXOXOXOXOXO

      WARNING!    WARNING!    WARNING!  ERIN'S VERBAL WANKING HIGH RISK AREA!!!!!!    OK, I've been going to bed every night with this insatiable need to listen to  the Strokes 'Room on Fire' . Now, I know that I've already blogged months ago about how amazing it is, but that was only after a couple of listens. You know when you have records in your collection that you think you've had a good listen to and you know you love em but they've kinda been in the background..... then suddenly one day it just seems to make sense that you absolutely adore this album. Well, this week,  Room On Fire  has been locked in as one of my favourite albums of all time. I think I've finally come to understand this intense connection with it which stems directly from my soul and makes me long to listen to it again and again. Its the kind of record that can't be thought of in terms of individual songs but as an entire body of work, and this body is so drenched with a kind of beautiful, untouchable melancholy which has arisen from a life that promises everything and nothing. Seeing Julian's behaviour in a room full of people who would love nothing more than to talk/fuck/be around him for as long as possible, it saddened me to realise that I've never seen somebody look so desperately lonely, one thing's for sure, there's no mystery  surrounding the title of the album anymore.  I dunno, I guess I can't explain it, but Room on Fire seems to sum up my life at the moment. Trademark Strokes rhythms: a soundtrack to some relentless party,  smothered with Julian's heavy, slow and romantic drawl over the top tapping into a beautiful sadness that each and every one of us cherishes and holds close to our hearts.  DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA BOUT THE VERBAL WANKING!

      Working out of the "Rove" office is an absolute hoot. My boss's husband was hosting the superbowl so viewing was cumpolsory. The half-time entertainment "climaxed" with Justin Timberlake ripping apart Janet Jacksons extravagent costume to reveal her well-defined mammary. The entire staff re-convened a few hours later in the boardroom to view the said breast revealing on slo-mo hi-definition TV. But this has simply posed more questions than it has answered (yes more questions)  1. Was ripping janet's corsette deliberate? JT certainly didn't seem too surprised when he ended up with half a bra in his hand. Janet didn't seem in too much of a hurry to cover it up. It's almost certain he meant to rip something, but was he a little too eager?  2. Was her tit meant to reveal itself to an international audience of millions? Is Janet Jackson's career in that much trouble that she had to resort to busting out the boobies? Will this set a trend at future events in a post maddonna-brittany world? Will musicians now be constantly forced to perform naked in order to out-do their nature-loving, boundry-pushing, taboo ignoring colleagues? Will the ultimate pop act of 2005 be twin-sister-lesbian-strippers who sing songs about holocaust denial and clubbing baby seals whilst spraying non-biodegradable aerosole cans in the air?  In unrelated news "Lost in Translation" is a truely great piece of cinema and you all should go out and see it. Now.

      Miyah. Nice Summary, Furze. You just brought all those memories back to me!  Meanwhile. Miyah. No Counting Crows. I am very disappointed to say the very least. But despite rumours that Adam has fled the country to mend his relationship with girlfriend no. 456787,  his letter to the official website explains that his grandmother died yesterday. His mother has lost a parent. And considering his mother had always been there for him, he felt the need to be with her now. awwwww. The one time I try to get angry at him, he comes out with comments like that.    More Meanwhile. Starting a new business venture. A friend and I are starting the Melbourne version of Queenz of Noize; the female London promoter/dj duo becoming famous for having famous bands come to their club and spin records with them (they recently supported the Strokes in NYC too). I feel this may be my calling in life: get drunk, wear matching costumes, hang with celebs and look fabulous. Accompanied with a genius promotion/marketing plan, this bar is gonna be the hottest place in Melbourne/ the rest of this stinkin borin country. We shall be called  HOT TRAMP  and all the cool kids shall flock to see us, leaving shitty ol' dingaz and cherry behind!!!!!!! AAAGHHH HA HA HA!!!!.

      Shayne thanks for posting that, it was hilarious! Hope you are well, haven't heard from you in a while.   Hannah you don't realise how lucky you were to see that gig. Yesterday Counting Crows pulled out of their entire Australian tour citing a death in Adam's family. All remaining Australian shows are cancelled (they only did Perth) and a press release is going out today. I only knew of this because they were booked to play Rove tonight and had to pull out, having left the country and all. Of course myself and the little panda's were a bit devastated, having 3rd row seats and all. But now I'm wondering wether there actually was a death in the family or wether Adam is hurrying home to try and save his relationship. Rumour mills commence churning...  If you haven't already go visit guy's blogg. He's such an enjoyable writer, putting his own self-deprecating yet humourous spin on everything swimming by him in life. I love it! Everyone should blogg like him - as if no one is reading it. But easier said than done.  Also for the Apex of blogging look no further than "Belle De Jour" (a google search will lead you there). Unbelievably well written blogg from the diaries of a london call girl. This girl has inspired a massive following, as well as a trans-atlantic search to unmask her identity. Last month she secured all bloggers holy grail - a six-figuure book deal. A must read.   And now to completely contradict the tone of the aforementioned bloggs and return you to the normal levels of decency and depth as expected on this here NW of bloggs.  The weekend Report: Check out Panda's nu pad on friday night. Drinks, drinks before hitting the town, Cherry bar, dingdong lounge, end up trashing hotel room at Westin after 3am check in (this is becoming tradition), 3 hrs sleep, breakfast then bowling and tequila on chapel by midday sat, shopping expidition followed by getting kicked out a sth yarra bar for multiple day-time dirty pashes, more drinks, move on in evening to cricket club presentation night, graciously accept trophy for batting, graciously skull requisite beer in front of 70 cheering hoons, whip into phone box and change from mild mannered drunken sporting hoon into super-hip, rock pig outfit, able to leap large buildings in a single snort, find the poodles, more drinks, more taxi's, croft institute, harvey walbangers, weekender, stupid dancing to the Cure, taxi, unconciousness, bed, sleep, sunday write off.  Can't wait to go overseas so I can slow down a bit

      Found this little beauty on the the back page of the New Yorker, thought you would all enjoy this little piss take of Hollywood producer types.   The Back Page By Steve Martin    STUDIO SCRIPT NOTES ON "THE PASSION"    Dear Mel,    We love, love the script! The ending works great. You'll be getting a  call from use to start negotiations for the book rights.    -- Love the Jesus character. So likable. He can't seem to catch a  break! We identify with him because of it. One thing: I think we need  to clearly state "the rules." Why doesn't he use his superpowers to  save himself? Our creative people suggest that you could simply cut  away to two spectators:    SPECTATOR ONE   Why doesn't he use his superpowers to save himself?    SPECTATOR TWO   He can only use his powers to help others, never himself.    -- Does it matter which garden? Gethsemane is hard to say, and Eden is  a much more recognizable garden. Just thinking out loud.    -- Our creative people suggest a clock visual fading in and out in  certain scenes, like the Last Supper bit: "Thursday, 7:43 p.m.," or  "Good Friday, 5:14 p.m."    -- Love the repetition of "Is it I?" Could be very funny. On the  eighth inquiry, could Jesus just give a little look of exasperation  into the camera? Breaks frame, but could be a riot.    -- Also, could he change water into wine in Last Supper scene? Would  be a great moment, and it's legit. History compression is a movie  tradition and could really brighten up the scene. Great trailer moment,  too.    -- Love the flaying.    -- Could the rabbis be Hispanic? There's lots of hot Latino actors  now, could give us a little zing at the box office. Research says  there's some historical justification for it.    -- Possible title change: "Lethal Passion ." Kinda works. The more I  say it out loud, the more I like it.    -- Is there someplace where Jesus could be using an iBook? You know,  now that I say it, it sounds ridiculous. Strike that. But think about  it. Maybe we start a shot in Heaven with Jesus thoughtfully closing the  top?    -- Love the idea of Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene (yow!). Our  creative people suggest a name change to Heather. Could skew our  audience a little younger.    -- Love Judas. Such a great villain. Our creative people suggest that  he's a little complicated. Couldn't he be one thing? Just bad? Gives  the movie much more of a motor. Also, thirty pieces of silver is not  going to get anyone excited. I think it'd be very simple to make him a  "new millionaire." Bring in the cash on a tray. Great dilemma that the  audience can identify with.    -- Minor spelling error: on page 18, in the description of the  bystanders, there should be a space between the words "Jew" and "boy".    -- Merchandising issue: it seems the Cross image had been done to  death and is public domain -- we can't own it. Could the Crucifixion  scene involve something else? A Toyota would be wrong, but maybe  there's a shape we can copyright, like a wagon wheel?    -- I'm assuming "The dialogue is in Aramaic" is a typo for "American".  If not, call me on my cell, or I'm at home all weekend.    By the way, I'm sending a group of staffers on a cruise to the North  Pole, coincidentally around the time of your picture's release. Would  love to invite your dad!    See you at the movies!    Yours,   Stan  With love to all

      what with blog, got no weekend action? unlucky bastard.   i went to counting crows on saturday night and while i realise i am about ten years behind the eight ball- it was amazing, although i think they probably thought it was pretty shit. it seemed to epitomise what people expect from perth, ie wierd crap sports stadium trying to facade itself as live music venue, not enough people  to fill it bla bla bla. adam said he got dumped that morning via text message which i dont know if is true or not but buntine could well mean he is on the rebound and in melbourne as of tomorrow..... Anyway we thought it was wicked cause we could stand really close with only a few spastic skateboy "mr jones" types jumping around in front of us and enjoy the show in a progressively more and more hammered ambience. so thanks to buntine for exposing me to "most beautiful" and other consequent compilation crows albums.  that was pretty much my only excitment for the weekend, yesterday was spent as one of those days where you do nothing and then realise it is six o'clock so pressume there is no point doing anything then and just slowly make your way back to bed.......... ps i went saw a show at waapa last week, looks like the p&d department are missing the Des Crew and Lx boys of years past, now all exported to the east coast to perform design miracles they once performed there....

      GUY!!!!!   You sneaky little bastard!!!!!   Using Your 'Go Blind' Administration rights (which I forgot I gave you) to sneak in and silently drop your new blog into the links!!!!!!  I was just innocently scrolling down the blog links, just about to go to Symposiasts, then I was like 'Whoa, Hold the Phone!  'Petrol in the Car'????!!!!  What the fuck is that?? I don't remember putting that there!!'  It was one thing when I silently placed a link to my short lived 'serious side-project' ON MY OWN BLOG  but I don't know about droping it on somebody else's.....  You realise what this means, you're gonna eventually trail away from Symposiasts just like you did with Go Blind... you little blog-slut..  Whoa. this whole thing sounds kinda harsh.... its not meant to... I was just surprised thats all.      Its a cool blog by the way. props.

      Loved last night's 'Newlyweds' show, amazing. Jessica Simpson and Nick are sooo lovely, and can actually sing. Funniest bit; where she had to re-record her single because she sounded too talented, too much like a singer, and the record company claimed the audience wouldn't be able to sing along...such bull-shit! ooh, and when she is amazed that buffalo wings are chicken, and that buffalos don't have wings?!  Their relationship is so real, they have the same fights and anxieties as any regular couple despite super-stardom and shit... get into it, 9:30 Wednesdays, channel 10!  later  ooh, and the bit where nick has to sing at his grandma's wedding at a retirement home..he he

      Yay, a new poodle pad! Can't wait til the housewarming, which I'm sure will be a total booze-fest in the Perth tradition (which has now been brought to Melbs). It's ridiculous that since Panda and Erin have been here I've been seeing about as much of them as I did when they were in Perth and I was conducting my twice yearly visits. Blame the fact that I'm spending every day in front of my computer either writing essays or avoiding essays by writing a blog (like right this very moment). Also, it doesn't help that Erin and I function on different time-zones. My waking hours are from 8am til about 11pm. Erin seems to work, in a natural state, from twelve noon til 4am. Very little crossover. BTW, all you WAAPA people, you HAVE TO SEE  CAMP  before it gets booted out of cinemas. It is seriously the greatest film in the history of the world, and as its about musical theatre, you'll feel a natural affinity for it.

      yaaaaayyyyyyyyy!  I have a gorgeous, cute, humble precious little poodle pad to call my own!  My friend chris and i are signing a lease on wednesday morning and get our keys, and are moving into Holden road in North Fitzroy.  Just a few sweet minutes to Brunswick street! AMAZING!!!!  Erin will sleep in the lounge room every second eve which has two french doors so she can retire undisturbed and the poodle pad lives once more!!  Hoorah!  So all melbournites be expecting an invitation to a little housewarming in the coming weeks!  Can't stop smiling about my new treasure!  Love to all.....

      Sup. Jees, Furze, you are the master of procrastination. I'd like to announce that  urlLink Amy's Blog  is back on track... I got abused in the comments and I'm still going back for more.... then again, my bag got stolen at Cherry and I'm going back for more there too.......  there's just no disciplining me... hate to think what might happen if I was an elephant near an electric fence (WHAT THE SHIT AM I TALKING ABOUT?)  Just a few ditties I'd like to see on the RSL karaoke list (and I can't believe they weren't): Back in Black - ACDC Love On the Rocks - Darkness Push It - Salt n Pepa The Gentle Art of Making Enemies - Faith No More (love to sing lines:  'happy birthday, fucker'  and  'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had'  to some 70 year old)    And now, songs that I can't believe WERE on the RSL karaoke list: 'Don't want nothin but a good time' - Poison 'Ocean Spray' - Manic Street Preachers (their worst selling single ever) 'Girls on Film' - Duran Duran (think of the video!) .......Amongst others that I cant imagine any wrinkly havin a crack at .

      Nice one Laurie (good to see you on the weekend to BTW)  I rarely grace the karaoke curcuit, although some people have been moved to say that I sing karaoke full time. Here's my top 5.  1. Janie's Got A Gun - Aerosmith 2. Emperor's new clothes - Sinead O'Connor 3. New York State of Mind - Billy Joel 4. Boys are back in Town - Thin Lizzy 5. Turtle Power - Partners in Kryme (lyrics reproduced for your pleasure)  Soundtrack : teenage ninja turtle (1991) * T-u-r-t-l-e power! T-u-r-t-l-e power! T-u-r-t-l-e power! Teenage mutant ninja turtle! In a half shell, they're the heroes four In this day and age who could ask for more? The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious Our police and detective are farious, ,cause they can't find the source. Of this lethally evil force This is serious so give me a quarter I was a witness, get me a reporter! Call april o'nail in on this case, and You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste! We need help, like quick, on the double Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble! We need heroes like the lone ranger When tonto came pronto, when there was danger They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour, ,cause they displayed…turtle power! [refrain] (2 times)  Now our miss reporter was hot on the trail Determined to put these crooks in jail She spied the bad guys and saw what happened, But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and caught! Yeah, she was all alone With no friends, and no phone Now this was beyond her wrost dreams, Cause she was concered by some wayward teens Headed by shredder they were anything but good Misguided, unloved, they called them the foot They could terrorize and be angry youth, and They mugged the people. who needed proof? Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound! Shouted "cowabunga!" as they hit the ground From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower Cause they possessed…turtle power! Do you stand for what you believe in? And find the strength to do what's right?  That's turtle power! Heroes in half shell, they're on a mission When there's a battle got the enemy wishin' That they stayed at home, instead of fightin' These ninja masters with moves like lightnin' They were once normal, but now they're mutants Spinter's the teacher so they are the students Leonardo, michaelangelo, and donatello, Make up this group with one other follow Raphael, he's the leader of the group Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop Pizza's the food that's sure to please, These ninjas are into pepperonI and cheese Back to the story, it's not hard to find Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind These are the words that their master instructed, But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted That was the last straw, spring into action Step on the foot, now they're goona lose traction Now this is for real, so you fight for justice, Your shell is hard so you shout, "they can't dust us" four! Like some old coffee table Since you were young you've been willing and able To defeat the snake, protect the weak, Fight for rights and the freedom to speak Now the villian is showin' so you take a stand Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand Remember the words of your teacher, your master: "evil moves fast, but good moves faster!" Then light, shining for your illumination Good versus evil equal confrontation So when you're in trouble don't give in and go sour, Try to rely on your…turtle power!

      Ahoy-Hoy Well its finally happened. Last night My family reached the height of Buntine-ness. It all started on Thursday night, when my Mum and Dad stopped in for a quick beer at the local RSL, granted they are about 40 years before their time to be going there but my dad is a sucker for cheap meals and beer. Dad enters a raffle (its for a good cause) and ends up winning first place:                                         100 FREE POTS OF BEER.  So last night, Miranda, Ian, my Bro, Mum, Dad and Myself sit down and get stuck into it.  At around the 70 pot mark, the oldies at the RSL crank up the karaoke machine......oh man it was all down hill from there, especially after we found out they were giving away hampers of alcohol to any old participant. So we sang Mona (by Criag McLaughlin), Horses (need I say who by) but I think the highlight was me and Ian singing God Gave Rock nRoll To You to a packed house, most of whom were 60+. W ended up walking away with 3 hampers!! Man, we worked that room like there was no tomorrow, we had people swaying right up to the cheap seats (i.e mum flapping her arms around at the back) I even managed to add the spoken word part (one my favourite lyrics of all time) which I better add to...................   Quote of the day:  'God gave you a gift! God gave you a role! and that role's name is ROCK N ROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!'..............ahhhhh the gift that keeps on giving

      Erin I wouldn't lose sleep, your career is definetly not over before it's begun. The good news is that the lead players in the music industry have all fucked up to the tune of millions of dollars and still managed to hang in there and thrive. Some shitty melbourne band booker trying to save his own arse and blasting you in the process don't mean nuthin. He's probably more pissed off at himself for not doing his job properly. Also, store his name in your memory. One day he'll come crawling to you for a favour and you'll be able to deal with him in kind. Some call it Karma, it certainly all goes around and comes around.   I'm pretty much known for my dire forecasts and diagnosis of the music industry, but if anyone here takes more than a passing interest in the mechanics of the beast take heart from the charts this week. John Butler Trio is a shining and prominent example of how you need not work within the old, outdated framework of the industry establishment in order to achieve sucess and have a fruitful and artistically rewarding career.   JBTrio funded their first album and have funded their own recordings ever since, which they put out through an independant distributor. This means that, not only do they have no label to answer to commercially or atristically, but they personally pocket $10 from every album sold (Compared to the $1.70 industry average). The major way they market their music is by extensive touring, which they profit greatly from anyway. They keep their overheads low and don't spend money unneccisarily on mainstream advertising and marketing campaigns. They built up the reputation and popularity of their act over several years, having then patience not to ever try and hype their way into everyone's conciesness. Their label mates, "The Waifs" have followed a similar career path, with fans all over the globe and very profitable concert tours.  This week John Butler Trio debuted #1 on the Australian Charts with their new album "Sunrise Over Sea", selling a massive 25,000 units in only it's first week of release. This is an amazing achievement for an independant act and a level of success and profitability that Australia's major labels can only dream and hopefully aspire to. In reality the success of JBT should be a massive fucking wake-up call to the majors.   It should spell out that the days of signing some act just because everyone else wants it, while having no vision for the act nor any idea of how to develop it other than to throw huge bundles of cash around and hope that something sticks are over. That spending more on marketing and the paychecks for outdated, dinosaur execs than on development is stupid. That signing acts that will do well with 14 year old girls for about a month before dissapearing is short-sighted and ultimately unprofitable. That signing acts that simply ape what was popular six months ago is not progressive, imaginative or very smart. That the internet was the most exciting music delivery system to emerge in 1996 and that being eight years behind such a crucial technology and failing to see it's potential is unforgiveable and incredibly fucking incompetent. That bitching, whining and sueing fans now that the downloading horse has bolted is pointless. That telecommunications companies are acting more efficiently as record companies with their ringtones then the actual companies are. That their days are numbered and and unless they repent and change they will eventually dissapear to be replaced by a system that is more efficient and kinder to artists and fans.  I'll now quietly step off my soapbox...

      wowy...what an awesome night was had by me at hifi bar.  Was so impressed by elbow, what a great set, heaps of songs from asleep in the back, performed seemlessly, effortlessly, beautifully....esp Newborn... that blew me away.  Great crowd, great lighting, great sound, great gig.  And very pleasantly surprised by cut copy, seeing as i had never heard any of their stuff....and so cute too!  Thanks to Craig for the tix, what a little gem.

      yes yes the cunt who stole my bag (phone, wallet and fresh pack of ciggies) is a complete  ASS-BANDIT!  Meanwhile the consolation of my amazing new phone which does everything short of making a coffee for me in the morning, is quite an entertaining delight. Its one of the few things in my life which i can turn to at any minute of the day or night to make me smile........(cue post-adolescence world-owing-me-something monologue here) .........  I am actually now in fear of despising the music industry as well (although I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner) after getting the shit blasted outta me by an  ABSOLUTE CUNTY-CRAPBAG band booker  from a well known city venue which shall remain nameless, for something that wasn't even my fault, in fact, it WAS HIS.....the fuckin little cock-jockey..... so now I'm sitting here hoping my music-related career hasn't ended before its begun... lucky for me i get to go to an awesome gig tonight ....that is  ELBOW (supported by CUT COPY :))  and hopefully  Placebo  tomoz.... so I'll be back with reports. Love yas!   ps- Hannah. where the hell are ya?  oh and Shayne, where the hell are ya?

      It's amazing how all sympathy for Erin's plight with the lost handbag dissapated the instant she got home with a better phone than me and Panda. It's almost like the scene from"American psycho" where Patrick Bateman thinks murderous thoughts apon his workmate because he has a nicer business card.   Mobile phones used to be such a status symbol. Now it's just about how many gimmicks you can fit into a tiny plastic casing. Take Erin's new phone - It has a camera (With a flash!), it connects to the net, it has bluetooth, it checks email, it sends pictures, sounds and movies, it stores 687 names, it has a diary, an organiser, a calculator and 24 different versions of Tetris. It has a clock on either side of it that even turns into a vanity mirror. It slices, it dices. It does your homework, washes your car and remembers to put the bins out. It can locate Bin Laden, it can produce a Jay-Z album. Last night I spent fifteen minutes watching Erin open and close the damn thing just so she could hear it go "Bing!" Thank god for technology...

      here here leon.....Malena from average joe is a stupid fucking hoe bag slutguts.  Sorry to steer the blog back to the real world furze!  I can't believe she picked Jason...erin and I were basically in tears.  She really did not make the wisest decision (i know i am completely lame...my life revolves around trashy tv, sushi and tequila), but what has Jason got?  As far as i can see; bad skin, no job, no prospects, no money...and he is a total player....trying to get her drunk so she can "lower her inhibitions"????? That doesn't even make sense!  On the other hand, Adam is so adorable, so sweet, so thoughtful, and not really all that average, being a millionaire and all.  How hilarious when he got her Victoria Secret pjs and that big pink dog teddy which he set fire to with the billion candles he laid out all over the room!! classic stuff.  Oh well, Adam is now set to star in his own spin off reality dating show, as they all do, like that complete dick with the stupid laugh from the last one of those shows....cant remember his name, not important anyway.  May have been rob...anyway..... On a more serious note, some fucking moron stole erin's bag last night from Cherry.  And they must have done it while we were standing right next to it.  Poor poodle, her last 50 bucks, beloved phone with the ball game, various cards (that are such a fucking bitch to replace), and whatever else a poodle carries around with her on a saturday evening.  Well my offer still stands Erin....you can have anything that i have got that you might want, to cheer you up!  And if i find out the mother fucker that stole it....beware the wrath of panda!   Furze...your eyes did not decieve you, i was, in fact, mega dirty pashing a gay man.  However, i was just a pawn, god knows what buff, bronzed man was being imagined while i was being mauled!  Not a bad pash though for a gay boy!!  And just so you know, gay men find me more desirable than straight...i think i have pashed more gay than straight.  Jesus, imagine if i moved to sydney...i wouldnt have a night off!!!! Oh and erin seems ok now...she has just got home with a brand new, specky LG phone that is way better than my 7250i, so you cant have anything of mine now because youve got a better phone than me! Love to all Leon...i dont want to know what mischief youve been up to...and dont say you havent, because i havent heard from you in two days....how weird is that...ive been ditched.

      Was reading the paper yesterday when it occurred to me that there is the slightest, most minimal chance that Howard, Bush and Blair could all be voted out of office within the next twelve months. The thought of the three blokes responsible for so much that is not good being simultaneously swept from office filled me with so much joy I nearly choked and my cornflakes (which were as always covered in huge quantities of vanilla yogurt, the only way to start the day). Does anyone else feel a gathering sense of excitement from the opinion polls lately that say Labor would win by a landslide? I haven't been this happy since Jeff got the arse by a record margin in 1999. Hate getting too political on this here bloggy blog, but responsible social and economic policy still means something to me and I can't wait to vote for a viable alternative to the current mob. Went to Canberra a couple of weeks ago and talked to a lot of people in public office. Already large numbers of public servants and departments are re-aligning their offices in preperation for a change of government, perhaps the best indication yet that somethin's about to happen.  Welcome with open arms Mr Leon to the blog. That last post cracked me up! May your adventures continue to appear in this here blogg.   Gardiner, if you're reading this, Incubas are confirmed to play Rove. Probably a stupid question but let me know if you want to be in the audience. That goes for anyone else in melbs...

      Come one come all and read my blog. The World has stopped ... i am in BrisVegas. I have my cowboy hat on, my white pants, hawaiin shirt and i am ready to go. I made the flight on Virgin airlines on Saturday and i am sure that you all realise that it would have to be the most unglamourous airlines to travel in the entire universe and as you are aware i am far from unglamm. Anyway to cut a long story short i dont do very well with having a bloody aisle seat, being served by girls wearing cardigans and blue plastic rubber gloves, being harrassed like a mofo about needing a panadol.....NOT PANADEINE... for a bloody headache, only serving bacon as a choice piece of food...... yeah a pig at 3000miles so classssy.... Anyway without sleep i arrived in Brisbane. TO my amazement it was so fuking hot i couldnt breathe and went straight into the toilet to get changed into short and a tshirt..... totally hideous conditions for my first stay. Anyway met up with my friend Trindy and we went to grab some breakfast.. So assured of the idea that Brisvegas was full of absolute freaks. This notion was right and i will divulge. The waitress who popped out behind the bar was thin... when i say thin i dont mean the kind of thin you say about celebs i mean the kind where your knee bones are so sharp and pointy you could carve lamb...... anyway not important, was is important is how 2 seconds seconds later this guy came in so fat that he needed to sit on the couch, next a guy in a suit so short his feet could not touch the ground, then 10 mins later a guy came in who was so tall he had to duck when he came in the door......................... very fucking freaky i say. Well i went back home and spent the entire day asleep ..... no suprised how traumatised i was from the experience..  I then spent the night watching Meet Average Joe ............. could you believe that piece of shit..... putting that poor average men through that fucked experience with those hot guys. Now while in certain areas of my life i like everything picture perfect their is more to life than the surface.. What the hell was she thinking,,,,,,, i couldnt believe it. nearly fell off the back of the chair when she chose the guy with the perfect looks...... WHAT A SKANKY WHORE..... SHE IS A TOTAL SLUT AND I HATE HER....... ANYONE AGREE.   Meanwhile caught  the bus down to Byron Bay this morning.... my life is so galmmaaaaaaaaaaaaa. i feel like its an episode of Kath and Kim. The bazarre thing about the trip was all those wierd theme parks..... whats the deal.. Anyway when you travel one hour down the coast you go into a different time slot because of daylight saving, how bizarre. SO i went one hour forward by going one hour down........ does that make sense. I have spent the whole day hiking through the rainforrest and learning from Robert how to cook. He made Pavlova.................. again another K$K special (kath and Kim for all you slowies).   Well i better go outside and play with the butterflies.....   love to you all... 1) Shane i hope that you are welllllllllll, where are you when i need you 2) poodle, piche and Bunts loooooooooooooooooove you work girls 3) Tiff and Trennnnn you rock my world (wedding temp rising)  and to the rest of the Blog world, which ever timeslot you are in  goodnight and farewell...  all my love LEON   PS FORGOT to tell everyone not to worry, my life is now back on track, i will not spend the rest of the year in a silk gown, sipping cosmos and eating dip... that time of my life has ending................. well until poodle comes to stay with me!!!!!!

      Panda you are a beautiful, affectionate poodle and I know that you like to spread the love but did I see you locked in passionate embrace with a gay man? I must admit that the scene caused me great amusement. Now you are turning gay men straight. Is there no end to your poodle powers? Rockroom keeps throwing up the funniest nights of my life...   Just booked tickets to the coachilla festival, a massive 3 day rock festival in the californian desert. Most amazing lineup, and probably wouldn't have even discovered the whole shebang if it wasn't for Erin blogging about it (thanks girlfriend). In addition I'm doing a 3 week road trip through america with my compadre Benno. Think two guys in a big Caddillac travelling through Nashville and doing there best to accurately re-create scenes from "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Hopefully I'll be able to blog some sort of road diary for y'all...

C) you exchange talking to these losers with consumption of their alcohol..........  take it from me can lead to depressingly hammered state and perhaps chunderous vomitting. gross. spewing when you havent even had a good time being drunk is just shit.

      hmmm I've come to the realisation that my life is ridiculously fun, hilarious, outrageous and stupid, and I earn absolutely no money (apart from my $20 a week from uncle johnny, he's oh so generous) I mean, I go out almost every freaking night and get ab-sol-utely trashed (not just drunk) and various establishments then somehow stumble home at around (average time) 4am, then (4 days a week) get up at 7am (usually still drunk) and go to Tafe then do it all again. I feel like I'm reliving last year! except that i actually do constructive things as well. I've also come to the realisation that I might actually die soon. I mean, most people pay attention to the warning signs that their bodies give them..... when I die my mind is gonna pissed off: (roleplay)   brain : why the hell didn't you warn me this was gonna happen?  body:  how many warnings do you need?  brain:  what the fuck are you talking about?  body:  ok, I gave you a severe headache for a week and a half for which you were prescribed pannedine forte  brain:  yeah.......  body:  I made you pass out at the dinner table and you almost smashed your head into your food  brain:  oh yeah.........  body:  you've thrown up in the toilets of almost every bar in melbourne  brain:  i guess so.....  body:  and after each and every incident you went to a bar and continued to get wasted  brain:  so.........  body:  SO DON"T FUCKIN BLAME ME MOFO!  brain:  oh............ok.  BUT ITS ALL GOOD FUN!

      So, it is blogs birthday, and i dedicate last night to it!  An evening of true debauchery on my behalf once again...Erin and Furze can vouch for this.  I talked to a drum that was sitting seat belted in the back of furzikins tarago, marvelled for a long period at the possums on the powerlines at 1am, convinced some indian and english tourists that i drove a formula one at the grand prix and hosted a cartoon show (nice touch furze), had an in depth conversation with a cabbie that involved me repeating the same words over and over again without realising, waking up a random room of people at pony that had somehow all simultaneously fallen asleep at 3am in a roaring pub (which erin titled a german art installation), pashed pashed and pashed again, and the list goes on!   I believe that tequila has some kind of magical effect on me, and furze i think on you too, as soon as consumed i actually can not stop laughing....it's laughing juice!  And there does'nt even have to be anything to laugh at.  Furze, we must investigate further..... So happy birthday bloggy....don't say i never do anything for you! i love melbourne

      WELL HAPPY BIRTHDAY GOBLIND@BLOGSPOT.COM...  I must admit that since erin squeezed you out, you have developed into quite the post-modern, information dissemination platform.  Or to put it another way... you have become a fascinating, integral and voyeuristic pitstop in my day to day life.  You represent an abstract and unfocused distillation of what we think is important, the things we want to reveal about ourselves, our belief systems, our tastes, our flights of fancy, our whimsical musings, our accute observations, our fears, our dreams and most importantly a lasting record of a most remarkable set of relationships.  Its strange that many of the throw away comments made in this forum, actually combine to present a wonderfully revealing, warts and all picture of those that made them.  Blog is a strange little miracle of the modern age, a document that hints at honesty and community.  The sum total of whatever we felt like contributing.  and look at what we made...

      this blog is a dark little place where we confess our dark little secrets about our dark little lives. Now it feels like we're lounging around in a beige 70's waiting room exposed in all our ugliness by harsh flourescent lighting and the even uglier thought that NOW PEOPLE CAN SEE US! Please go back to black soon... or tartan, that would be cool... Does anyone remember that mysterious globe symbol that used to sit in the top left corner? Whatever happened to that? Or when we used to link to sky kicking? Or when Laurie D used to blog about her hockey adventures? Or when I used to write big long sermons on the ills of the music industry like I was lecturing some TAFE... those were the days...

      yeah... I just pulled a fourteen hour shift at Blockbuster Galleria... Besides being tired, having sore feet and a profound desire to spend the rest of my life silently horizontal. I am actually surprised.  Surprised that the bogans i serve (SO WIERD TO USE BOGAN AND SERVE IN THE SAME SENTENCE), are actually starting to hear what i've been saying all this time about qualitative film experiences.  I have a hard core clientelle of recently converted (perverted) bogans who can't get enough of the smaller, non-studio, foreign, edgy, a grade/b grade, socially relevent, totally irrelevent and offensive film material that i keep putting in their grease stained, tobacco yellowed, peroxide smeared little hands.  Amazing....!!!  Thats all really...   just needed a lil' blog to unwind.  Had a wierd day missing you guys today.  love to all  oh yeah, Furze i should be over in early - mid april (fingers crossed).  and I think we should celebrate the birth of blog with a commerative, compulsory blog day were everyone with access must contribute something of significance....   just a thought.  nuff said

      hey bloggers just scrolled down the blog to see when my last entry was and it seems to have been so far into the past that it no longer rates a mention on the current page. thus i thought it was about time i got off the bloggin sidelines, reading and not participating, and through a spanner in the works........so to speak.  totally non-related point of interest for my day was heading into oxford st leederville for about the first time in six months and a) remembering how good the st itself it is, great cafes, great clothes/ homewears etc b) that really good looking funky people stiil also exist - they just hang out in leeds and not claremont - no surprise there. c) diference between a good coffe and a shit coffee is so extreme they shouldnt be referred to as the same beverage. d) a point not really restricted to leederville - there are so many wicked fashion/ design mags to buy (or read in the newsagent) if you look in the right places and, they do not have the words cleo or cosmo on the front.  anyway am going to a casino high rollers 21st tonight am going to attempt to look like any of the girls off "LAS Vegas" think if i refrain from wearing a top i might be on the right track..........or could always wip up a life sized poker chip cossie......... mmmmmmm later team  - H

      This week I'll be doing a feature on the handful of albums that have shaped me to be the person you see today.  I was inspired to to do this after I blew the dust off my copy of  The Cure's 'Pornography'  last night and gave it a spin. Man oh man did the memories come flooding back. To those unfamiliar with  The Cure's  work other than  their sugary fun hits like  'Friday I'm In Love' , 'High', 'Lovecats', 'Just Like Heaven'  etc I imagine  them to be portrayed as a slightly wierd yet ultimately superficial band with some fat dude up the front with big hair and make up.   But what never ceases to amaze me and the main reason why I love the band so much is the vast scope of emotion they've poured into all their songs over the past 25 years. Ok, granted the Cure's lineup has basically changed every 2 years which will account for the amount of variety in their music, but good ol' fat Bob keeps on rockin and I have no idea how he survived writting this album.   'Pornography' has often been voted 'the darkest' or 'most depressing' album of all time by the likes of  NME, Rolling Stone  etc. But the words 'dark' and 'depressing' don't even begin to describe how horribly heart breaking this album really is. It was actually quite firghtening to realise that these songs were once so much a part of my life that they were basically my soundtrack. Every track swirls and washes into another with a deep grief, the lyrics bring up images of black haired girls, hanging gardens, black flags, and who can forget :  'A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat, i open my mouth, and my head bursts open, a sound like a tiger thrashing in the water, trashing in the water' . It  was actually rumoured to have been written about the suicide of  Joy Division's Ian Curtis  a year before its relaese in 1982. What  makes me most uncomfrtable about listening to this si the fact that Robert Smith actually lived on to write such stupidly happy songs like 'Lovecats' and 'Mintcar', at least when you listen to  Joy Division , you pretty much know what you're gonna get, this might sound wierd, but the fact that  Ian Curtis  died brings some kind of sick comfort. 'Pornography' is just disturbing.  Admittedly yes, I do suffer from manic depression (like every other fucker on earth) and this album might not be for everyone, but its definitely worth a listen.    I'll leave you with the lyrics to my favourite Cure song ever, track 4 on Pornography.....   SIAMESE TWINS   I chose an eternity of this Like falling angels The world disappeared Laughing into the fire Is it always like this? Flesh and blood and the first kiss The first colours The first kiss  We writhed under a red light Voodoo smile Siamese twins A girl at the window looks at me for an hour Then everything falls apart Broken inside me It falls apart  The walls and the ceiling move in time Push a blade into my hands Slowly up the stairs And into the room Is it always like this?  Dancing in my pocket Worms eat my skin She glows and grows With arms outstretched Her legs around me...  In the morning I cried  Leave me to die You won't remember my voice I walked away and grew old You never talk We never smile I scream You're nothing I don't need you any more You're nothing  It fades and spins Fades and spins...  Sing out loud We all die!!! Laughing into the fire...  Is it always like this?

      Don't think I can wait 2 months to see the "Hot Property" tape. Too funny. Don't have long so I'll make this a quick travel update for anyone that cares... The musical odessey of a road trip that started in Nashville (country and bluegrass), continued in Memphis (birth of rock and soul), is reaching it's conclusion in New Orleans (Jazz and Blues). The whole trip has been an amazing experience and a lesson in how much you really don't know about music. Hit New Orleans last night, it's mega touristy on the main strip but an absolute alcoholics delight. Every drink in every bar is custom made to get you smashed. They also serve it plastic cups and you can just walk out of the bar if you like and drink in the street. There is even little vendors selling $2 beers at the hotdog stands. What seemed fantastic about all of this last night is a little less thrilling this morning coupled with a giant hangover. No more hurricanes for me... Leaving for LA on friday and then Coachella festival on the weekend. Pixies, the cure, darkness, radiohead (full gig report please erin), muse and SLEEPY JACKSON!!! woohoo! umm, yeah... Gonna be quite a riot. love to all of you, happy birthday shayne, elanor you rock, hugs and kisses to the poodles. hope you are all well and happy  Andrew

Meanwhile Elanor, I stand corrected.  Went to Rove last night... Jet were on... they were standing a metre away from us...  They kept staring at me and Alana cause we were the only ones they could see...  They were wearing leather...  and.....  i gotta admit.....    THEY WERE FUCKING HOT!   SO HOT I ALMOST COULDN'T HANDLE IT  yes the bass player is the hottest, only coz I've gotta MAJOR thing for porn star facial hair at the mo'  So we left via the guest entrance and I'm running down the corridor with leon sceaming 'CAN THEY GET ANY HOTTER?' when we walk straight past them having a ciggie.... how embarrassing.....   meanwhile rumour has it they're playing a secret gig at Pony on Saturday night at 4am

      Can't believe I forgot to write this yesterday but:   HAPPY MOTHER FUCKIN BIRTHDAY SHAYNE!   hmm.... probably shouldn't have put the 'mother fuckin' in, as birth can kinda fuck a mother up... let alone the bad context of fucking your mother and...... oh god, I'm in too deep.  I'd also like to voice my disgust for  AMERICAN IDOL for kickin out Jennifer,  man the American public should be ashamed of themselves, and to think that talentless fucker with the red hair is still in it. Thank god it wasn't Fantasia, girrrl i love you, and thats somethin. Meanwhile in other unoriginal news,  Popstars  sucks so hard that I feel like I'm watching DIY television. Wait a minute, I guess I kind of am, it is channel 7.

      just a few things to comment on as I wind up the week:  -  Urinetown, the Musical  is freakin awesome, I never thought I'd live to see the day when I actually enjoyed watching  Lisa McCune  perform, let alone enjoyed a musical in general,  but this show is a bloody corker and if you have the opportunity to see it, do yourself a bloody big favour.   - I'd like to congratulate all those who participated in my  test about me , especially Miranda for topping the class with 90%, Hannah coming in second with 75% and an equal tie thrid with Anna and Laurie on 70%. Top work. Meanwhile Furze, I can't believe you only got like 65 or whatever, you really have been tuning out while I've been talkin haven't you!   - Thank you to all who came along to the gig on  Wednesday night , your pressence was greatly appreciated. Sorry about having to sit through the evil tripple M-ness  of  Avenza , hopefully  the Beings  made it a little better.   -  Cheers to everybody  involved for a tops night last night: Trenna, Greg, Leon, Marnie, Bridgie C, Crackers, MacGregor, Jono, Poodle , Bronnaz (tho brief), Alana and Anthony....... of course I was rock n roll wasted as per usual but in such fabulous company which made it even better................  and now I'm walkin on sunshine whoa!!!! and its time to feel good! whoo!   ........... oh fuck yeah.   Albums I'm surprised I want to buy:    - new Eskimo Joe - new Youth Group   Albums I damn well NEED to buy:    - Cut Copy 'Bright Like Neon Love' - Eagles of Death Metal - the new Datsuns album... can't wait for that one

      ok, don't have much time in this starbucks (every starbucks in america now has wireless internet access it's awesome) so I'm going to put some free-form New York musings for y'all.  New York is the best city on earth  New York is not that bad - I don't know if it's a post 9-11 thing or what, but new york is not nearly as intense, rude, crime-ridden, or nasty as everyone says. People are generally polite, if brisk. The service is never too bad (hey do they want the tip?), the weather at the moment pleasant and the taxi's generally B.O free. And this isn't rose coloured glasses either, i've been looking for the worst and just not really finding it. New york is easy to get around, the subway is clean, cheap, safe and efficient. the cabs are unbelievably cheap, it's virtually impossible to run up a fare past $8 in manhattan. The bouncers at the clubs have been cool, the cops on the street jovial and the little dogs that ridiculously dressed women on 5th Avenue walk seem to yap not too much. Brooklyn is becoming safe and a little gentrified. The village is becoming a bohemian fashion capital. Oh my, the village (my future place of residence). Full to the brim of record stores that have savaged my credit card to the point where I may have to return home several months early. Full of obscure anonymous bars where bands of every genre occupy the floorspace of a phone booth and play nightly, full of colour, culture, history and attitude. I am moving here without a doubt, just find me a place in manhattan for less than $400 a week...  Every single person on the island of manhattan own an Ipod. Period.  New York has 130 people in it. The lonely planet will try and fool you into believing that 8 million people co-exist in this thriving metropolis but it's complete bullshit. I've made same amazing friends here who I've met in completely different circumstances in unrelated places and they all FRICKIN KNOW EACH OTHER! over and over again. This point was undelicately illistrated to me on monday night. Me and Benno attended the launch of a new Tommy fragrance (try if you will to imagine me and Benno on the red carpet with the photographers snapping like crazy, behind Maris Tomai and the cast of "queer eye"). I was kind of hooked up with Jesse Malin's keyboard player who was playing the party. Across the room I spotted an MTV presenter I had kind of hooked up with several nights previous in a bar on the other side of town and had been in contact with since (friend of Carlos' for the benifit of Ez) . Sure enough to my horror they have mutual friends and in about 4 seconds I'm in a pile of shit. Benno later ends up having conversation with MTV's ex-boyfriend in completely unrelated bar while going home that night with Ryan Adams ex-girlfriend (quote: "I've been where ryan's been..."). Jesse Malin was a really great guy by the way and went out of his way to get us into the gig. Sorry Ez, but Mr C is a complete animal. Half the women I've met are connected in that they were once with you-know-who, even one girl from London and another from Germany.  8 million people on this island and I meet random people who are all connected. I guess it's because everyone over the age of 24 on this island has some fabulous job, costume designer for Law and order, MTV presenter, (successful) musician, (successful) models, (successful) artists and, dare I say it, (successful) actors. No wannabe's like LA, just people doing their thing, and well. And you'll never get out of them what they do either. Big note-ing, networking, name dropping and bullshit are all things they do in that plastic fairy-tale known as L.A. In NY people are busy getting on with the business of doing it for real. And no one cares that you are from Australia.   New Yorker's to a man loathe Bush, and I love them for it.  So much more to say but I'm completely out of time. Off to Carlos' birthday party tonight. Open bar upstairs at Piano's, huge night ahead. Got a flight out of here at midnight tonight, got a feeling that I won't be going to sleep...  Love to everyone, Erin hope your gig went well. everyone else hope you are well and having fun, especially you shayne, you sexy sexy man.   ciao babies!

      Now, I spend a lot of time and energy convincing myself and other people that my course (music industry [business]) is not a waste of time, and is not a rediculous thing to study and is not taught by jack black.  But looking down at the 3 page assignment which took me 2 hours to write entitled:   Obtaining Sponsorship PA971 Case Study: CHRISTINA AGUILERA AND SKETCHERS FOOTWEAR   my entire theory is blown to shit.

      Miyah.  obligatory Logies Blog.  I have a feeling I should make this in point form otherwise I'm gonna ramble. I have a feeling I'll ramble regardless.    * Firstly, the entire production was HIDEOUSLY Channel 9.       a) Obviously, Eddie being his usual annoying fuckwit self, but more on that later.     b) The Nine Network had rigged the awards in such a way as to give the majority of the minor awards to their own programs in hope that we wouldn't notice as much, well that's my theory anyway. Cmon, who the hell actually watches Mc Leod's Daughters?     c) The set was hideous. It was all washed with that horrible and unmistakable 'Channel 9 Blue'. It was cheap, tacky and embarrassing. I felt like I was watching the Brownlow.     d) The Sound and Camera work was appalling, most of the live acts' mics only kicked in 1 minute into the song, as if they were doing a soundcheck as they went.   * Guy and Shannon's performance reminded me of the P.A.F or some kind of Rock Estedford.    * Yeah, the whole Delta (or Deltra, as Eddie would say, and did say, 3 times) Cancer thing.   I can't believe they did it again. After being appalled at the on stage 'conversations' she was forced to have at the ARIAS, I cannot believe, Eddie went out of his way three times to mention it and ask her how she was going. The look on her face said nothing but "Yes, fuckwit I have cancer, I know it, You know it, everyone here knows it, let's get on with it"   * Very impressed with the CNNNN win.   Can't believe TV week buyers voted for them but fuckin good on em.   * Elanor, just read your blog about Rove's acceptance speech.   I think all he was saying, and I agree with, is that the Logies really are important to have in Australia. I mean Rove knows they're a pile of shit, and must be pretty boring sitting at that table just drinkin away, and that oddly, there suddenly seemed to be a lot of people reading TV week around the office at Channel Ten in the months prior. But really, what else do we have? Australian television is something that should be nurtured, congratulated and celebrated. Its part of everybody's lives, even if we watch it just to bag it! And with 90% of Australian Actors being unemployed, I think its something that should be encouraged.   So yes the Logies are a sham. But we love it. We love seeing Home n Away sluts coked to the eyeballs and falling out of limos. We love violently throwing things at the television when Eddie McGuire comes on. We love cringing at Bert Newton. We love wisecracks about Larry Emder. We love perving on Dicko with his new hair and proclaiming how hot he is......  oh wait. Thats just me.  But anyway. I guess I'm just saying I love any kind of awards. They're hilarious for a number of reasons, usually the wrong ones. And I'm tired of comparing them to American or British awards, because you just can't! They're cheap, they're tacky, they're try-hard, but I say embrace them in all their glory!

In the last 2 hours I've done: Career Personality Test Right Job, Wrong Job True Talent Test Ayurveda Body Type Test Discover Your Sexual Personality Gender Identity The Colour Test How bright is your Aura? Your Subconscious Self Finding Mr Right and the Sexual Turn On Test........   ok, this whole subconcious obsession with sex thing is beginning to freak me out, for the  Sexual Turn On Test  I got:    you get equally turned on by physical appearance, personality, and environment   People who are equally turned on by a person's physical appearance, their personality, and environmental factors appreciate a man in his entirety — how he looks, what he's like, and the circumstances the two of you share.   Find out why you're physiologically wired to react this way in your personalized Sexual Turn On Report. It's ready right now!    So basically, I'm turned on by everything under the freaking sun!  THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!!!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

      Ra ha ha ha ahhahahaha!  Check out the results of my  urlLink INK-BLOT test:     your subconscious mind is driven most by Sexuality   What this means is that when your unconscious mind sees an opportunity to remind you of your sexual desires, it takes full advantage of it. Because of this, things that have very little sexual content or that seem sexually neutral to others, may register as sexually charged to you, at least on an unconscious level.  Your unconscious mind recognizes the value of sexuality. The reason it may do so, is because of a deep-rooted fear of the opposite — living a life that is numb to sexual desire or is turned cold by it. You unconscious mind may be trying to avoid this sexual dullness, and so it reacts by swinging to the opposite extreme, strong sexual desire. By sending you these sexual messages on a regular basis, your unconscious makes sure you don't forget about sex.   If you view your sexual desire with a positive attitude, you can welcome the vitality and strength sexual thoughts can bring into your life. This would allow you to honor the drive your unconscious has chosen to be an important focus for you. It is a message that you are very much alive, and have a great deal of passion to bring to life.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Sexuality, there is much more to who you are at your core.     Yikes... that ink really knows its stuff

      The other night I did one of those Internet IQ tests that you only ever do at like 5am, when the thought of answering anything like    What number should come after 161, 174, 134, 221 .....   and   If Jack is shorter than Jane but Jane is Taller than Harry but Harry is fucking Jane...   Seems like it might make your head implode.... so you avoid it... along with most of the five page test.  So I have now been informed that my 5am IQ is 125, and I have no idea what that means. I have also been informed that I am an Insightful Linguist. (Just like Charles Dickens! aint that dandy?)   'This means you have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual talents of an artist. You also have a creative and expressive mind.'   What a pile o' horse-shit, but so intriguing.... especially that ink-blot test....always wanted to do that

      Last night marked a very sad moment indeed, the end of ROCKROOM.   Thats right, I rocked up to pick up my pay and guzzle some free alcohol while I was waiting, only to be informed by the gorgeous Stacey (bartender) that Rockroom shall be no more. With that news I made everybody in the room make a pact that they were gonna get drunker than ever before, and boy, did people keep their promise. Think I can safely say that everyone was completely ratshit, at one point I turned around and realised "wait a minute, this isn't Rockroom! this is Alana's apartment! I drove here! and now I'm dancing in her loungeroom with Adrian, Jonothan, Anthony and MacGregor, and poodle has vomited and passed out!' Ah classy classy classy.   Gotta admit, I'm pretty sad, I was really growing to love my ROCKROOM family, I wish we didn't have to part/ have to PAY for drinks now..... I'll really just miss djing [my only source of income, and the greatest job in the world] oh well, i'll just have to find some other trashy bar to work in.  FUCK YOU FURZE GOING TO THE MUSE AFTERPARTY IN NEW YORK! I HATE YOU!

      Dear god, matt bellamy split up his face playing in Philidelphia a few days ago and now Muse might have to blow out their show at the Bowery Ballroom in NY, leaving me completely deflated. Please get better matt because I've been building this gig up in my mind for over a month now, damnit. (that was just in case matt tunes into this blogg and needs a bit of inspiration to get off the canvas, everyone else just ignore that little tidbit...) AAAGGHHHHHHH!!!!!  Anyway New York is wonderful and I can't really complain. Got another studio today but after that it's party time. Actually it was party time sunday night the day I arrived. Might have gone out a "little" hard in my excitement to be in this wonderful city. Hit the town with Carlos who was a wonderful and benevolent host (maybe too benevolent). Started at a soul/rock bar called 13th, progressed onto Black and white where the bass player for some band DJ's. left around 4am and stumbled back to my hotel. Erin so sorry for the phone calls, emails and sms. I'm afraid that I was a little trashy and really have no idea what I was on about. Actually a bit annoyed at myself for wasting a lot of yesterday in bed but, do the crime, do the time.  Going to see the mel brookes broadway show tonight "the producers" tonight and an AIR gig after so fun times to be had fer sure.   This city is magnetic, teeming, inspiring and I can't get enough of it. Just walking around soho and the village is enough to make me start seriously considering moving here (god I wish). Much more to tell but out of time. Hope everyone is well. Love you all

      I turn 29 soon.    This means that I am well and truly in my late twenties, and only one year away from my early thirties.  Scary stuff.  Worse still are all the warning signs looming in over me. Strange things that all point to impending thirties.  The very fact that I have started to want to own "High Fidelity", which in spite of Jack Black coolness screams "30+ and male" is causing alarm bells to go off in my head and also preventing me from actually buying the DVD.  Go figure...  What does it all mean?

      Hello friends   I was just reflecting on my life (it's pretty quiet at work tonight), and came to the conclusion that life is pretty good.      BUT    I'm not having enough fun...     ...period.  I long to get boozy with Erin and Poodle and dance like dickheads to eighties music whilst subtely sending up everyone around us, and pumping people we hardly know (or don't know).  I long to fall asleep, half drunk and talking about physics and god with poodle and then get up late because no one knew how to set the alarm right.   I wanna play video games with leon and marvel at how wierd and cool it is that i am actually playing video games with leon.  I can barely remember what you guys smell like   cursed nostalgia

      i have almost officially had a coronary!  Yesterday is was the most surprised EVER...casually strolling down brunswick street with erin...pestering her about when i was to receive the "present" she had informed me of an hour and a half earlier...when someone slams into me half way across a very busy intersection.  Rudely shocked out of my three year old pleading and wailing..i've gone to be all "yo biatch watch where your fuckin' walkin hoe..." when i see Leon 3 cm from my face!!  I then proceeded to scream, jump and hyperventilate...while still standing in the middle of the road.  Erin kindly yelled "get the fuck off the road dickheads" so more screaming and general hysteria on the footpath!  How AMAZING!  Was so happy, and in awe of the fact that both Leon and Erin had managed to keep this from me!  Couldn't have come at a better moment...esp. that it was easter and was feeling a little glum about being away from the fam and charming little perth!  So in the words of my mum..."Leon is a legend...and so is Erin!"  What a great surprise.   Furze, saw you on the front of NW making out with David Hasselholf outside of the Viper room.... you dirty slut!  We missin ya back here, but i'm lookin after poods, so all is good!  Have a blast...glad the atm visits bring a smile! Shayne.. i love you and miss you like a mofo, cant wait to see you and talk a lot! Tiff.. you HAVE to save some of those hard earned pennies to come visit me and stay over mine and have bessions...i could maybe even organise some sunblest and olive oil as a treat for you! Erin...my thoughts exactly on the Von Bondies... but i was kinda expecting what we got... oh well, it turned out to be a great night...with all the ingredients of hilarity...me spilling beer on myself (a whole glass), toad in the hole, giggling fits in the cab, stupid dancing, and being poor!!  A1 material! Love to all and to all perthonalities...cya real soon!

      Got 2 seconds left in a internet booth in dosn town santa monica so here goes...  been in LA for five days now and I'm leaving on sunday for new york. My head has been constantly spinning in a kind of try-and-take-these-moments in dickhead-because-it's-not going-to-happen-again-soon kind of thing. I'm staying with a guy named named Allan Spearman at his LA bungalow from hell not far from Hollywood. He's an older sound engineer guy who's worked with bands like Sugar Ray and Cake and runs this awesome studio in sth pasadena. Been working with him on a couple of my songs and it's going really well. Went to Viper room a couple of nights ago and they had then most fantastic hair-metal tribute bands going on, like full spandex, teased perms, make-up, the lot. The crowd really came dressed to impress too. I'v never seen so many grown men wearing makeup and with big hair. It was a really funny night, epsecially after meeting "Bud" who's pretty mush devoted his entire life to honouring Motley Crue. For 2 hours I got a song-by-song, album-by-album breakdown of why they were and still are the greatest band to ever grace the stages of rock...Hilarious...AMAZING!  Anyways gotta roll so here goes...  Shayne - If you liked belle de jour make sure you latch onto "true porn clerk diaries" - one of the greatest online journals ever written. I think belle de jour links to it on her page. otherwise google...Also life is this amazing thing that rolls on and on and churns up people as it goes. it's too short and you are too much a good person to worry about anyone who's not along for the ride.  Erin I'm missing you like you wouldn't believe. Everywhere I turn there's something going on and I'm thinking "Erin would love this". Start planning international trip 2005 girl (preceeded of course by gallery exhibition "2004 - 2000 and more"). Love you heaps  Panda love you too. Missing poodle kisses like crazy. Still smile everytime I queue for an ATM...  EVERBODY- please keep posting on da blogg. You are all so beautiful. so far my travel journal here's been kinda crappy, but in reality I've been working pretty hard. Promise to spice it up when the road trip happens.   Ciao!

      Miyah. So saw the  Von Bondies  last night, and frankly, was kinda disappointed. I mean, I'd heard rumours that their gigs hadn't been that great, but with the amount of hype they've recently recieved, like, outta nowhere, just in the past few weeks, was getting me really excited about seeing them. When I got there I realised that as always, this hype was generated purely to boost ticket sales, as it obviously wasn't sold out, and I had a spare ticket that I had high hopes of selling out the the front, and ended up not being able to  GIVE  it away.  Don't get me wrong, they were pretty rockin and the performance of 'Rock n Roll Nurse' was one of the most rockin things I've ever seen but there was something lacking. There was no bonding with the audience, they just powered right thru for a measly 1 hour set. I think the only time anything was said was when they were encouraging us to clap along, asking if anyone had been in love, and then doing the oh too common line 'wow, you guys are awesome, you're living up to everythig we've heard about Melbourne, we heard you guys rock!!!! and there's so much talent in this city! blah blah blah......' that aint impressin me anymore, infact its giving me some kind of 'legendry music city' ego, so much so, that bands are really gonna have to put out to impress me.  However, there's no way my ego could ever match that of the  Von Bondies . I mean yeah its cool to have rockstar 'I'm so cool it hurts' attitude, but for a band who a have around 4 awesome 'party songs' and aint being terribly original the rest of the time, I really think they should lose the toode and stop taking themselves so seriously.

      hey guys  's been a long time between blogs i know. I have actually become addicted to Belle De Jour (THANKS FURZE!), so I have been catching up on 7 months of posts over there. Awsome blog.  I miss you guys as always, that doesn't actually go away...  ... but i got something on my mind.  At first i was amused... You see, it all seemed ridiculous that someone we all thought was our friend would call up from another state and speak poorly of someone who is right at the hub of our fantastic Melbs/Perth collective, and is important to all of us.  In fact it was so ridiculous that no one really even stopped to consider how rude and underhanded it was.   It kinda just passed me by.  Then someone crosses the nullabor and once here, makes a paltry effort to show up to a couple of shin-digs and does little but bitch and complain, and continue to slag off my friend.   Again, I didn't really think about it. I was too busy enjoying my last booze up with a wonderful poodle person.  I just didn't notice how bitter you were.  Soon after I started to see you around again, sometimes daily. It was wierd because you were strangley detached and had this thing going were you would just blow people off (including me). You did this inspite of the fact that you had (apparently) enjoyed their friendship for quite a long time, and had even told them on occaision.  Fine with me, I think i get it now.  You've moved on.   No hard feelings right.  So it's been like that for a few months now, and i've noticed how no one really minds to much. No hard feeling right.  And then out of the blue you get in touch cuz you want help to get some drugs....!!!???  No HOW ARE YOU?? or WHATS BEEN HAPPENING?  Just a meezly SMS asking for a dealers number...  Your loss noni... your loss

      Whoa.   Mega Quiet Blog.   So, anyways, finally bought the Franz Ferdinand album. i.e JB HiFi  only just got it in stock. It seems such a shame that they've become the latest NME hype band, cause they're so damn cool and as soon as the NME jumps on something it seems to make people wanna chew them up and spit them out almost as quickly as the magazine itself does. Although,  its not like they don't deserve the hype, they are fuckin cool and 'Take Me Out' is possibly the best song to drunkenly dance to at 4am ever! But sometimes I just get this sickly feeling when I suspect that certain bands were actually 'created' by the NME by doing things like puting the demo of Franz's 'Tell Her Tonight' on their 'Hangin With the Strokes' compilation in mid 2003..... and proceeded to get me all hooked on it...... wait a minute, i don't know if any of this is making sense coz I'm trying to listen to the album on headphones at the same time.   Anyways Dick Smith Power House Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All singles $2, Vinyls $8-20 and you can order them in!!!!!!!!! and average album price $18, looks like I'm never going to JB again.

      I've never felt like so much horseshit in my life, apart from maybe, last weekend. But yknow, had to get wasted, last night being Amy's housewarming and Furze's going away drinks and all. However, let it be said:  I AM DETOXING FROM ALL DRUG-USE FOR AT LEAST 2 WEEKS (except cigarettes).  Now that it has been said, I'm relying on all of you to hold me to that. I fucking have to, my brain is so fried, my hands are shaky, I've only just peeled myself off the couch to type this and you can probably hear me coughing from Perth. To make things worse, my little Furzikins is leaving me for NYC,..... come to think of it, who wouldn't? Needless to say I shall be heartbroken, and won't know what to do with myself, and considering I'm detoxing........no furze, no alcohol, no drugs.....    WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO AT NIGHT?   I'm gonna be staring at a wall counting down the hours. Oh god, its hell! HELL!  But I'm really only cursing so much because I'm insanely jealous. Andrew, You will have an amazing time, and you have to find  the most random place you can to blog from! Safe and happy travels.  Now, back to what I was doing: oh yeah, mope.

I just finished working with Adam Cook. Apparently he is the hottest ticket in Australian Theatre at the moment.   A BIG SHOW. A real mind fuck at times.   So yeah... My point is I actually really loved it.    Life is really wierd...

      Spotted 2 fresh-faced (hence annoying) first years discussing the coolness of Counting Crows, only for one of them to wish the other well at the concert (which was meant to be that evening). I laughed, in that evil way that makes you look like the private joke you are having with yourself is psychotic, b/c I knew, thanks to furze, the concert had been cancelled...  is that bad?

Be prepared for a "new generation" at the Scottsman, although i do believe with your insane powers of persuasion you will be able to haul all the old crew from far around back to their roots on wednesday!  Better get those panics tix asap...Perth seriously is about 30 years behind...Panics cost $5 and the shops are still shut sunday, being a 'family' day and all!!! But thats why i love it.  I am now fully booked until i leave perth.  I have lunches, dinners, arvo beers, movies, bbqs (oh bbq i love u...and i dont even eat meat), cocktails, bessions, theatre, amplifier bar....AMAZING!! And still the sun shines, only been one cold day! Think i will die on return to the icelands of melbourne...

      Ahoy-hoy. Yay! Miranda informed me last night that I will get to see  the Panics  in Perth after all, at the old haunt:  The Velvet Lounge , and to sweeten the deal, its only $5!!!!!!!!!!!!! yippeee. In other news, ummmmmmmmmm.......... wait, I don't have any news.  OH YEAH! I'm  djing @ Revolver  this evening for  Indie Initiative , so come along y'all for cool 'straight-edge metal' times (thanks Graham). I hope my head feels a little better by then coz I'm kinda in a weird space since last night, MacG, I dunno what you gave me but I feel weird. But hey, it made class a little easier and more entertaining today! (ps - I told people about the whole smoking banana skins thing, and they said it doesn't really work, then somebody else said to try smokin dried up vegemite, seems to do the trick) ahhhhhhhhh the things we do for cheap thrills.   And so yes, that is today's news.  I'm Audi 5000.

      Doop di doo.  Hmm it is rather unfortunate that during the week I am going to Perth, all the good Perth bands are touring Melbourne. That'd be bloody right. Was quite looking forward to  Eskimo Joe, the Panics  and  End Of Fashion  (always knew those guys would take off). But.... blah what are ya gonna do?  In other news, I scored Top Of The Class again today with my third High distinction ...  'because I'm such a girly swat'     I seem to be unknowingly setting a high standard for myself. I mean, this is ridiculous, this mark was for the Study of  Christina Aguilera  and Sketchers that I mentioned! I mean cmon! It took me 2 hours including research! Its not that hard people! Either I've finally found an industry that I excel in, or the rest of my class is completely fuckin stoopid, I think the latter is more likely. (jokes! To anybody from class reading this!)  In more news (the lazy way): -  the Vines  suck ass. And the singer is a complete child. - I was gonna see them tonight to make fun of them but now I shall be hitting  revolver  to see Aaron rock out as his band is playing there, and I've been promised some serious scissor kicks and stage dives.  - Speaking of scissors, the more I hear from the  Scissor Sisters  the more they totally rule. - Ouch! Just realised I haven't bought any albums since  Franz Ferdinand ! And that was ages ago! FUCKIN DAMN BEING POOR! ITS SO FUCKING SHIT! - And I am soooooooooooooooooooo excited to go to Perth on Friday to cop a huge hug from Shayne, get wasted at the Scotsman, drink beer with Bec, cop a dirty pash from Piche, and check out Leons's swingin pad'. YEEEAH! GET DOWN ON DA WESTSIeeeeeeeeDE!

      He he he, just rediscovered the joys of the 'recorder'. For some unknown reason, my Recorder from Grade 3 was randomly sitting next to me, so decided to give it whirl. Man O Man, I dunno how the hell teachers put up with this crap, I'M ANNOYING MYSELF HERE! Let alone multiplying this ear drum bursting squeal by 30!   I've now resorted to sticking it up my nose like Ralph Wiggum and just breathing normally. Pretty soon my mum's gonna come in and ask what hell keeps making this noise: "whhhoooo......whhhoooo......whhhhooo........whhhoooo" hehehehehehehe sometimes I amuse myself so much that its scary.

      aaaahhhhh Perth.  I thought the homeland had forsaken me on the day i arrived...it was cold, windy and raining.  But this big wad of a state has come through for me and busted out some warm rays.  Oh sunshine, how i've missed thee.  I can truly say that the weather has a profound effect on my mentality.  It could be the fact that im seeing all my greatest pals, my loving fam, and am not working in the fume factory (pet name for the arts centre carpark), but waking up to rays of warm light through my window, after sleeping on a proper bed, and the first thing i see is my little meow meow snuggled up and purring...is the greatest thing in my world! I've also seen some great critters in the 3 days i've been here...dolphins, quokkas, bob tail goannas and seagulls.  The seagull is not usually something i would usually class as a "great critter", but after the episode on rottnest island, i have to say that i think they're ace!  Shayne..i know your currently pissing your pants if ur reading this!  Shayne, myself and tiffany decided to take the little runabout boat for a chug around the bay on sunday after trennas wedding.  We all piled in with a box of bbq shapes for the ride and proceeded to leisurely boat about on the open sea.  I think it was Tiff who thought she would throw a shape to a one legged seagull flying parallel to us(where do all those legs go by the way, and how come so many freakin seagulls have lost one leg in the first place?)sorry about that...i will now continue with the story... But as you can imagine, in true seagull style (you throw a tiny morsel of food and they start flying from antartica), we suddenly had a swarm of sky vermin flying behind us!  This caused Tiffany to have about seven coronarys in succession. So Shayne sped up, and to the average boater or person strolling on the shore, we would have looked like three screaming twits flying across the bay dodging boats and bouys (those floating bobble things), with a plague of seagulls chasing us trying to steal our shapes.  The fact that the boat only did about 6 km, tiff was screaming like someone had just chopped off her nipple, and the army of seagulls were flying 5cm from our heads all added to the hilarity of the situation.  As all those who know me could imagine, i was about to combust!  Laughing with such force that i thought all my organs were going to come out of my mouth at once!  This is not so great when you are trying desperately not to fall overboard.  And it wasnt a short episode....this went on for a good 7 minutes or so till we had driven the entire length of the bay to nearly the edge of the island!  Something i will never forget. And this is an example of why i love Perth....cos this random shit could only happen here in this random gigantic state! Hope all is well in melbs, and poodle u are not going crazy just yet.  Cant wait for u to get ur ass to the west side...i'm starting to realise that u are actually my "other half", as some people like to say. Everyone over here is coupled up, and i just thought...well my partner is getting here on friday, so nnnnneeeerrrr! Well, i think i have satisfactorly bored you all enough now...so take care me heartys   Hooroo

      As if I'm not already pissed off enough with people being overseas for summer, today i read this:   The Curiosa Festival 2004 will feature  the Cure  headlining a bill that also includes three bands plainly influenced by Robert Smith and company:  Interpol, the Rapture  and  Mogwai.   A second stage will also be part of the traveling road show, with  Muse, Thursday, Cursive, Melissa Auf Der Maur, Cooper Temple Clause and Head Automatica  rotating as performers.    gggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

        Abandoned   Its official. I have been ditched by a large majority of my small group of friends. Furze MIA O.S somewhere, Poodle in Perth and now Kate leaving for the UK today, with Prue soon to leave. Goddammit. I'm gonna be so bored! I do realise that I'm going to Perth next Friday, but it just seems like this week is gonna last forever. Considering I can't afford to get to school its gonna last even longer as I'll be on the couch for the most part. Sick of being broke. (yes, I can hear you all saying "get a fucking job erin!") But I can't handle it! I can't handle doing any more shit kicking jobs when I should be doing something   fabulous   by now! I should be doing some kind of fantastic music/arts related job, and generally getting paid for being fabulous!    WHY AM I NOT A ROCKSTAR!???!! Hello!?    If anybody needs to be a rockstar its me! God damn me not having any musical talent!!!! Maybe I'll just become like the 'CLUB KIDS' of NYC early 90s and just be famous for the sake of being famous and wear cool outfits, go on talk shows and take lots of drugs, and then get wound up in some kind of dodgy murder scene... hmm maybe not.

      Thanks for the advice kiddies, think I'm all set now. Craig's hooked me up with the inside info. (thanks Crackers!)  Elanor, your comment was hilarious! But I just couldn't do that. Name dropping is very frowned upon in our class. I learnt that through observation. Plus, half the girls in there are band-aids anyway (finally! I belong!)I don't think I'd be teaching them anything new!  Deary deary me. Hmm whats been happening? Indie Initiative was on Thursday night so I toddled off to that and was bloody awesome.  Bands:  Waitress  - Pretty fuckin shit. Thank god they were on first when nobody was there. The (supposedly) female singer was dressed in some kind of "I work for an accountant" outfit. We had sneaking suspicions that she was really a boring secretary by day and nobody in her workplace knows that she's a singer in a band by night.   The Kissingers  (formally known as JetSet)- Hilarious. At first I was like "What the fuck is this?" The singer was about a metre high and he was jumping and dancing around like some kind of Vegas Lounge singer (the silky shirt wasn't helping) but after a while I was like "yeah! I can dig this, these guys are awesome and funny, and I hope they're not taking themselves seriously" They'd be a great support for Franz Ferdinand   The Beings  - Sigh.  The best gig I have ever seen them play, it was just fuckin beautiful. To quote Alana "It was like when you haven't had sex for a long time and you finally realise what you were missing". I think that pretty much captured the performance. The whole set was like fuckin hot slow sex. Amazing. Goddammit! If they don't get famous soon I'm gonna kill somebody! Are you listening Labels!  THE BEINGS ! goddammit! Fuckin do your job properly! jesus.

        Advice?    So, I have to do a 10 minute 'Presentation' on 'anything related to music'. Considering, this is a fairly broad subject I'm asking for suggestions. So far people have been getting up and talking about their favourite albums and shuffling a few blank pieces of paper to make it look like they've written notes. I'd like to be a bit more 'organised' and 'professinal' than this. And please do not suggest anything to do with downloading, the internet, and how this effects the industry, coz I'm bloody sick of it. I need something edgy, cool, relevent and interesting to everybody. AND I'M SERIOUS PEOPLE! I NEED SUGGESTIONS!  Also, it has come to my attention that you cannot use this new commenting system unless you have a blogger account, which completely sucks ass and makes for why there's so little commenting going on. However, in the meantime if you do have a suggestion PLEASE EMAIL ME!   Meanwhile! PERTH! HELLO? WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU ALL? AND WHY AINT YOU BLOGGIN?

         N.E.R.D   Ya, so last night I went to  N.E.R.D  (aka  the Neptunes , aka writers of almost 50% of high rotation songs played on U.S radio (Justin, Britney, Kelis etc) )at the Forum. Hot Diggity Dog, its was the best live show I've seen a long long time. This might be due to the fact that I don't see many gigs outside of the 'rock' genre too often, and I'd forgotten how great hip hop shows are. Although you can't technically put  N.E.R.D  in the 'hip hop' box, or any box for that matter, but its the same energy that they bring to a show, the kinda vibe that makes everybody go insane. Plus the show sold out pretty quickly which always makes the performance more special because everybody there was a realy big fan. And I mean REALLY big. The audience were amazing, they knew every song, every word, every beat and they never ever got tired. At one stage  Pharrel  had THE ENTIRE FORUM, every single person in the maxed out room; jumping up and down with their hands in the air. It was quite awesome.  Also a big highlight was when he goes, "Right, now, I want y'all to put up yo' cell-phones! Light up yo' celly in da air yknow what i'm sayin? yeeeeah'" It looked so cool, it seems mobiles are the new lighters in the air.   The only bad thing was Pharrel's over-protective body-guard who followed him to whatever side of the stage he was on, like um 'hello? aint no fool gonna stab you in Melbourne yknow what i'm sayin daawwggg?' But a tops show. five stars. *****

        Guaranteed Cheer-Up    Whenever I feel like I'm just moping around the house and nothing seems vaguely exciting or even generally interesting and I need a bit of pep in my step, there's one thing that is guaranteed to make me laugh:  The 2001 Michael Jackson Tribute Concert    Yep, I just bust that baby into the VCR, and set myself up for some serious laughs. I highly recommend it for anyone who's feeling a bit down in the dumps, here's a few scenes that'll have ya chuckling: - Shaggy's ridiculous power thrusting during his now forgotten hit 'It Wasn't Me'  - 98 degrees trying desperately to pull off the intro to Man in the Mirror, (with Nick Lachay looking stupidly tanned, buffed and good looking compared to those other 3 dweebes) Then to be taken over by Mivas (male divas) Luther Vandross and Usher  "Don't just talk about it! Be about it! whooooaaaaaaoooooooo ahhh ooooooh!"   and then once you've been warmed up with those lil acts, its time for the big guns, bring out the CHAMPAGNE COMEDY! The moment where your laughter turns into a cackle:   LIZA MINELLI   oh man. Liza, oh Liza....... you're so unbelievably bad, I almost don't know what to do with myself, but laugh laugh laugh. The chest clutching, the stupid trademark chuckle in the middle of a dramatic pause, the SHOWING SOME LEG WHEN YOU JUST DAMN WELL SHOULDN'T! and then mistaking the crowds applause for love when they really just want you off the stage! and then! blowing the audience kisses until  SOMEBODY DRAGS YOU OFF AND THEY CUT TO AN AD!    AGGGHH HA HA HA HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AGHHHHH HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHA!  ok maybe I'm the only one who's as amused as this, but I doubt it. Watch it people!

              	  Eurovision 	       Ah, television's night of nights is over. Yes I did my homework and watched Eurovision like a good little girl, and boy was it worth it. Man I laughed so hard that my entire body hurt, and here's a couple of reasons why: - first up, Spain's entry where the singer is holding an acoustic guitar to play 2 chords at the beginning then have the guitar whisked away by a random dancer - Norway's entry which sounded like John Farnham - France's entry with a random Grace Jones lookalike on stilts flapping her arms around insanely in the middle of a ballad and making the singer look like a dwarf Robert Mills - Greece gets special points because they were the only entry to capture 2 essential Eurovision ingredients: a white suit AND a 'reveal' - Malta's entry 'On Again Off Again' possibly one of the funniest fucking songs I have ever heard. It was like all the songs from 8 different musicals rolled into one, it was just insane. - And, my favourite entry: Bosnia. With the ultra camp 'Deen' singing 'In the Disco' singalong in standard European accent: 'I'm running Late, I'm losing my weight, kiss me, turn me slow, up and down here we go.... music's what I want, music's what I need... in the disco' - And the ugly as shit female host with the most hideous dress I have ever seen, constantly saying: 'And! In the top five places with the smiling faces! Are!'  oh lord it was so funny... for anyone who missed out, download Malta and Bosnia's entry now!

      On sat night, I was once again reminded how thankful I am for having the friends I do when confronted with the most infuriating female of all time:  Let's call her Pulie the dental nurse, and her much older dentist boyfriend, let's call him Pan. Anyways, I arrive at restaurant after everyone has eaten, and Pulie and Pan are complaining about the service as their main topic of conversation (faux pas number one as an ex-pat of the hospitality industry).  Then Pulie starts to tell everyone about how Pan drives a porsche and it has 300 horsepower. And how her and Pan are going to drive cars at Sandown with 600 horsepower, and how Pan's friend, the ORAL SURGEON (ooh, like they are soo good) has an even better car...and how Pan also has an mg... blah blah blah  WHO GIVES A TOSS???!!! WHAT DOES THIS MATTER TO ANYONE??!!  then the conversation moves back to bad service, and general obnoxious comments. grrrr   anywhoo, I found it annoying  later

       current music:  the inevitable 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'. I dunno if anybody else experiences this, but I have a default song that resurfaces in my head when I have nothing else to sing or hum along to. For some reason that song is  Whitney's 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'  was it Whitney? I think it was. Anyways, its been in my head for the past 3 years or so and its not going anywhere fast. Its just so great for belting out random diva wailing and bad eighties dance moves as I jive down the hallway and do the ol' 'socks-slide' into the kitchen, maintaining just enough balance to finish with some retarded kick and a 'whoo!'... or the part where it goes 'don't ya wanna dance say ya wanna dance don't ya wanna dance - DANCE!' whilst doing the 'running man'. OOOHHH YEAH.   man, the fun of socks on lino never ends.

      Ezla I can speak with great authority about music being ruined by an understanding of either how it is made or the biz behind it. Once I started getting heavily into music production I couldn't listen to anything and just enjoy it anymore. Instead of just appreciating the overall song I had to mentally rip it apart piece by piece. Instead of being swept away by some great melody and lyrics I'd sit there wondering what guitar amp they were using and what EQ settings they had on the kick drum - painful! Then maybe I'd heard on the grapevine that the album I was listening to cost too much or had to be remixed or some useless shit and I'd be obessing over that. Then worst of all I'd start listening to bad songs because "the production was great" (like avril lavigne - amazing production, annoying artist). Then I'd do this whole ridiculous "Can't see the forrest for the tree's" thing where I'd listen less to an artist because they had no obvious marketable value and I knew that it would ultimately fail, even though it was really good music - stupid. For about 2 years I don't think I really appreciated any new acts for my own pure love of them as against my perception of their worth within the industry. uuugghhhh!  And then one day about  12 months ago I found a subliminal switch that turned all of that off and I found myself loving acts just for the fricking hell of it and ignoring the industry babble. I'm still partial to ripping apart people's records and analysing production values, but I've also started jumping up and down on my bed again, and playing air guitar - both very good signs that you've forgotten about an act's marketing potential. I think you just learn to trust your own instincts about music and worry about the rest later.  That said, I'm so glad that you're throwing yourself into your course. It's a real tough industry, but you remain the toughest person I've ever met, so I've got high hopes. A future in A&R awaits...

       current music:  Interpol 'turn on the bright lights' its been a while ok!  I fear something horrible is happening..........   I may be losing my love of music.   ...Along with my sex drive, my lou reed tshirt, and my mind.   CURSE THIS MEDICATION!   Anyways, I don't think I'm actually LOSING my love for music but more that I look at it in such a different way now. Obviously I should have known this would happen undertaking a music BUSINESS course and all. I never thought I would become so business minded! Even the people in my class still OBSESS over new bands and stuff, but now, when I hear a new band or a new song, my immediate reaction is: What do they look like? How can I market this? What should the video treatment be? Regional tour, national tour, sponsorship, stylists, management, contracts, promoters, booking agents, producers, labels blah blah blah blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH!  Its horrible! I've lost all my music listening innocence!  I guess its not that bad, I actually quite enjoy it. Lucky I'm not a musician then it would be ten times worse!    PS - Laurie! You're still alive! Where you been all my life?

      My Homework  Man I really do love my course sometimes. Our teacher Dobe (cool old rocker type) says to us today:  "Right, I can guarentee yur response to this, but I'm going to get you to do some fucking homework for once!"  (class groans)  "But you'll be thanking me, because its kind of 'fun' homework. Sunday night holds the Music highlight of the year. Eurovision. Your task is to watch it, enthusiastically, possibly whilst drinking a few beers so you get over excited, and vote for each act. We shall then compare our scores on Tuesday and determine our own hideous fucking Eurovision winner. Won't that be fun!?"  (class cheers)  Ah, excellent, my favurite television night of the year and I get to watch it for 'homework' But I'm slightly disappointed that they've stretched it out into half hour slots every day, then a Preliminary final on Friday night then the big one on Sunday. Gone are the days of staying up all night for 7 hours listening to:  Host : "Cypres, your results please?"  Cypres : "Oh hello! we would like to say you are doing a wonderful job..  Host : (cutting her off) "Yes, Cypres your results please!"  Cypres:  "oh yes, 12 points to Greece!"  surprise surprise

      Ok, once again I've been proven wrong.  well.... not wrong exactly......  When I saw  Street Kid Vandal  a few months ago they were a little too big for their boots. They had the look but not the sound to back it up.  However when I saw them on Thursday night, they fuckin  rocked!  Rocked in a way I haven't seen for a long long long long time. The improvement was almost unbelievable. I don't know what happened, possibly new management, possibly just workin real hard, or possibly just had a real bad gig that night. All I know is they actually ARE what  Jet  has been hyped to be (but still haven't delivered). They know how to write a bloody good rock tune and can belt them out even more convincingly and louder than  the Datsuns . Plus they're all pretty fuckin hot. Nothin like a band fulla 3 dirty rock boys and one smoking hot pseudo goth chick bass player.  No doubt about it,   urlLink Street Kid Vandal   are my hit prediction of the year.   If only I actually did do A&R instead of just pretending that I do. Ah one day. One day.

      trying to score some franz ferdinand tickets tonight at the hammersmith odeon. wish me luck??!! Just landed in london. It's cold, overcast, gloomy and I couldn't be happier to be here. Staying with my good friend andrew Blain, who, as fortune had it, had a room for me to rent for the next three weeks in his all-aussie sharehouse (God there are so many aussies here, it's riduculous). Mr Stephen "Deluxe" Tucker is also here so much good times to be had. Even ran into a guy from school on the tube in from the airport. One thing this trip is teaching me is that the world is an incredible shrinking place. Missing melbourne and all you guys lately. missed you ms buntine most of all during the cure's set at coachella, mostly because I'd never heard half the songs before and kept thinking that you would have appreciated it so much more than me! Plus I'd just read your cure dissection on da blog and was feeling a little emotional.   I'm so jetlagged right now I'm not sure if i can keep my eyes open. too many 14 hr flights methinks. Going to be good to just stay in a one city now for a few weeks and really sort of soak it up. Travelling at breakneck speed through the US meant I haven't really digested a lot of what's been going on. Can't say it enough but I am missing all you guys like crazy. Hope you are all really well and happy. My old email address is working again so email if your bored with melb stories: afurze@bigpond.net.au  listening to: Kasey Chambers doing Ben Harper's "Lonely Day" Reading: Tourist maps in the middle of the street and looking like a dickhead tourist doing it...hang on... I AM a dick head tourist.  Loving: Seeing old and very dear friends, getting lost in london in the rain (really, i love this) and Wireless internet in trendy cafe's. Hating: My inability to stay up to date with emails, my inability to adequetly document everything I do for posterity, my inability to find the perfect rock suit damnit   cheerio

She walks out to her adoring live audience on the set made to look like her house (complete with dogs) and says " Ok, right, what we're talking about today is something that everybody does but for some stupid reason doesn't admit: plastic surgery. I have no hesitation in telling you I've had a leg lift, tummy tuck, arm lipo, bum lift, boob lift, neck lipo, face lift, eye lift and a nose job (to name a few). And I still feel crap about myself but most of that was for medical reasons. Here's a great friend of mine who also won't hide what she's had done,   Kathy Griffen ."     Yikes. after, seeing those before photos, thank god Kathy did get some stuff done.  But what I really enjoyed is just how honest the entire show was. eg - Sharon and Kathy blatantly bitching about how immature and stupid  Ryan Seacrest  is, Calling for make-up touchups in the middle of the  Little Richard  interview, throwing silicone implants into the audience and just having fun. Special highlight: at the end when Sharon is reading off the teleprompter and stuffs it up, then goes 'God! You know I hate reading off these bloody things!, see ya next time"   PS- somebody keep me away from  Sticky , if I make any more badges I'll be swimming in them!  For good times, come to  Revolver  tonight, I shall be there a little later on, gettin drunk and rockin out.

       Quote of the Day:   At the start of  Ryan Adams' 'Heartbreaker'  album there's an amusing little argument regarding which album Morrissey's 'suedehead' is on, the most amusing part of is when they're about to start a song :   Ryan:  '1!.. 2! ... uh... uh oh....(music stops, says in bad english accent) he's go' a mouff fulla cookies!'    Other Dude:  'We'll be bashed by facists and left for dead!'   Ryan  (high pitched) 'Left for dead!!!!!!'  oh man.... so random. If anyone can explain what this mouth full of cookies thing is please, actually no, don't its actually funnier not knowing what the fuck they are talkin about.   Current Music : Obviously  Ryan Adams,  but I've discovered that  'Shakedown On 9th Street'  is the most rockin song I've ever heard, you gotta love a track about a rumble between straits and greasers.

      I'd like to say, that I am thoroughly enjoying listening to  urlLink Triple J  these days. I might go so far as to say its a god damn fuckin delight especially during the day. Simply because I already know when I turn it on, that I'm gonna get gold:   Adam and Will until 9  in the morning, on the way to school: comedy gold. Makes the trip through peak hour Camberwell so much more tolerable, plus I always call up to speak to Adam Spencer, coz he's the greatest.   Mel in the Morning from 9  : possibly a little more subdued than I would like, because by this time I'm late for school an need something a little more upbeat, but still, there's always some nice, 'relax into work mode' tunes on at this hour   Miff: My favourite JJJ DJ,  she plays such fuckin great music (although its possibly not her who's playing it) I just know that every song that comes on is gonna be great, always try to leave tafe early to hear some of her show (even tho she's on holidays at the mo, I'm eagerly awaiting her return)   Today Today with Chris and Craig after 3 : Boy oh boy, this is a fuckin funny show from the genius behind  CNNNN , even though I have the suspicion they have no idea what music they're playing its still fuckin hilarious for the drive home.  Ok, if the  ABC/JJJ  don't give me a job now after that little plug then I will take it all back! Seriously though, I never thought I would say this, but  Kingsmill , you've done a great job.

      roving reporter update -   What this blogg really needs now is some independant analysis of international rock festivals, so as a service to you all I'll be at Coachella this weekend soaking it in for your later blogging benefit. We have a tent bought at Walmart, an Avis convertible and a whole lotta dreams. Actually we are so underprepared for this it's not funny, but the important thing is we are here. Erin wish you were here right now, seeing as I didn't even know about this festival until you posted about it on da blog so many months ago, didn't dream back then that I'd actually make it. Love the cure dissection and the album reviews by the way. The list that shaped my life is not nearly as cool but here goes anyway (this is not my favourite albums of all time, merely the ones that had the biggest affect on me over the years)...  John Farnham - Age of Reason I listened to this cassette so incessantly as a kid that it wore out and mum had to buy me another one. Played it all day, every day on one 5 day car trip top perth, nearly inspiring parental infaticide. Musically doesn't have much to do with me anymore but definetly inspired me to want to perform. Hi-light: johnny's ode to human imperfection "we're no angels"  Faith No More - The Real Thing  Got this album a couple of years later in Grade 6 (on cassette again). One tragic listen and suddenly poor johhny wasn't speaking to me quite the same. Hi-light: "Mid-life crisis", mike patton inspiring in me a hard rock crush that took a decade to die.  You Am I - Hi Fi Way The album that tought me how to play guitar. Easily one of the best Australian albums of the 90's. Hi-light: "applecross wing commander" with an ending that makes me want to smash something, or dance, or run naked through bourke st mall, or maybe just form a band and play gigs.  Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream When this album came out it seemed almost too cool for me to own. I have personally bought 6 copies of this album and, thanks to the CD handling abilities of my siblings, am probably destined to buy more. Hi-light: Billy corgan sums up every 15 year old kid's angst in mayonaise -  "No more promise, no more sorrow No longer will I follow Can anybody hear me? I - just - want - to BE ME!" ahhhhhh  Silverchair - Frogstomp. Probably raise a few eyebrows here but let me make it very clear - This album is a fucking great rock record. Most australian bands would severe their collective limbs to be able to write an album as complete and well written as this. Add the fact that they did it all at age 14 out of newcastle in 1995 - amazing. Shat me to tears when critics at the time called them "nirvana in pyjamas" when their sound owed everything to detroit-scene hard-rockers like Helmut, and much less to the quiet/loud Nirvana. Hi-light: cheesy lyrics aside "Israel's son" is a corker.  Honorable mentions: The Beatles - Abbey Road (played till the vinyl melted) Nick Cave - Let love in Ice T - Power (Don't ask) Stone Roses - Self Titled Nirvana - Bleach Cream - Disraeli gears The meanies - 10% Weird Pearl Jam - Vitalogy Violent Femmes - Self titles Smashing Pumpkins - Gish Snout - Circle high and wide Led Zeppelin - II Best of Dire straits Jeff buckley - grace Ani Difranco - Up, up, up etc  Once again only a few of these would make my all time top 10 but, as erin said, they made me who I am today. Love to all, hope you are all well. Glad to see laurie D blogging too, hope everything is sunny in your world.  ta ta!!

      In my attempt to live a life identical to that of John Cusack's character in High Fidelity, and after being asked last night what my top 5 albums are of all time, I think I've narrowed  it down...  1.  The Cure 'Pornography'   Favourite moment:  The chorus of 'The Hanging Garden':  'fall fall fall fall out of the sky, jump jump out of time, fall fall fall fall out of the sky, cover my face as the animals cry'   2.  Muse 'Absolution'   Favourite moment:  The point where Matt breaks into some kind of heightened desperation in the chorus of 'Sing For Absolution'...  sing for absoluuuuuuution! I will be singing and falling from your grace   3.  Ryan Adams 'Love Is Hell Pt 1'   Favourite moment:  The entrance of the Cello on 'The Shadowlands'  4.  Counting Crows 'Recovering the Satellites'   Favourite Moment:  Adam's breakdown at the end of 'Miller's Angels' : 'Can't ya hear me? coz I'm screaming. I did not go outside yesterday. Don't wake me please, don't wake me! coz I was dreaming. And I might just stay inside again today. Yknow, I don't go out much these days. Sometimes I stay inside all day. So leave me leave me leave me alone.   5.  PJ Harvey 'Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea'   Favourite Moment:  During the beautiful duet with Thom Yorke, 'This Mess We're In' when they get down to the spoken word bit and I'm pretty sure PJ says  'The sweat on my skin, (orgasmic 'uhhhh') '   I'm still not entirely sure of this lineup, it changes every week anyway.  Honorable mentions:  Depeche Mode 'Violator' David Bowie 'Low' Elbow 'Asleep In the Back' Strokes 'Room on Fire' Manic Street Preachers 'The Holy Bible' Interpol 'Turn On the Bright Lights' Ryan Adams 'Heartbreaker' Oasis 'Definitely, Maybe' The White Stripes 'De Stijl'  Starsailor 'Silence Is Easy' Muse 'Showbiz' Pulp 'Different Class' Joy Division 'Closer' U2 'Achtung Baby' Radiohead 'OK Computer' BRMC  - self titled James 'Pleased To Meet You' Counting Crows 'Across A Wire' The Smiths 'Louder Than Bombs' Morrissey 'Suedehead'  All of these mentions deserve a place in the top  five.... its just so hard!  TRY IT!

      I'm feeling so oddly positive today! I don't know why! But it just feels like a really good, day, I got outta bed, made myself a pipin hot mocha, realised there was nothing on t.v so decided to do my hilarious early 90s Jane Fonda Lean Routine. then felt pumped so went to the gym!!!!!!!!! Came home ate yummy Thai fried rice and now I just feel fan fucking tastic.... although a little full.   Meanwhile, I'm noticing huge side affects of my medication, especially after the group of meds I'm taking have been in the news a lot lately for the bad affect they can have, I heard them talking about it on Hack (JJJ). Like I can't stop shaking/figetting, wake up with a headache and nausea every morning until I take my pill, and my mind is racing all the time, like I'm on speed, that's possibly why I'm freaking blogging so much!! Oh well time for coffee with Guy, yay! More caffeine!

      MEANWHILE! HELLO? PERTH PEEPS???!!! Like where the hell are you? I want know about your lives godammit, I want something to read on this blog besides my own miserable dribbled shit! So get crackin!  Speaking of dribbling shit, my observations of the day:  - Kings Of Leon totally rule, everytime I listen to them they rule even more... altough I can't believe Caleb shaved off his beard!  - Caleb is a really cool name  - I haven't had a proper job for 7 months! goin strong!  - Mercedes totally should have won America's Next Top Model  - I blog way too much  - Need more activities that don't require money  - Velvet Goldmine is possibly the greatest soundtrack of all time.  - Sometimes when I'm alone I'll just blurt out random things for no reason, like when I was just driving before and outta nowhere shouted out 'SHUT THE FUCK UP!' to nobody!  blah blah blah blah blah talking way toooooo much SHIT

Ab Fab  Hmmm... I'm sure I must be missing something, but that sounds good to me. I could happily watch nothing but those 5 shows for the rest of my life.

      boo hoo...My sisters have gone back to the west side.  They arrived on Tuesday the 22nd, and left Sunday 27th.  That's 5 full on days and nights my friends...But I think I did a pretty good job of showing off our little vic!  Every night at least 3-4 different bars/pubs/clubs, and every day shops and landmarks...And it was great for me..cos half of em I had never been to either (being relatively fresh to melbs!).  But when they packed up and left my little flat on Sunday I bawled my eyes out.  Not only because I don't know when we will all get to spend so much time all together ever again, or when ill next see them...But because I realized I am the luckiest person in the world to have such an amazing bond with them.  Just thinking about them makes my heart all gushy and whimpering sounds come from my throat!  I don't care if I sound like one of the Brady's, they are so dear to me it hurts.   Ok, I've probably made some of you spew by now so ill cut it out.   Hallelujah...I have a mattress!  A real one!  New, bouncy, soft...Yet firm, no bugs in...And its all mine...Every night (actually don't know if that's such a good thing!).  I just slept a whopping 12 hours on it, so it must be a goodie. Speaking of many hours spent....I calculated I spent 9 whole hours with my sisters at the espy on sat evening. That's longer than the average working day...And I spent it solidly drinking...Its actually disgusting!  However, in those hours from 6pm till 3am, I did not stop laughing.   Highlights included: -The best air guitar session I have EVER witnessed.  Small, fat, bald rocker running around the espy doing scissor kicks and guitar and drum solos simultaneously! Laughed for a good hour at him. -Being told I had "nice puppies", then Prue slapping the culprits ass and telling him he had "nice puppies" -Prue in general...fucking hilarious gal -Seeing random guy from my highschool in WA and a waapa pal as well -Guy who came over to us an said "hey I'm Deano, and IM here to make you smile" then he pulled his pants to show us he was wearing Calvin Kleins!!!!!!!!!!Was probably funnier to be there. -Deano coming back to pull his calvin's off and shove his bare ass five centimeters from mine and Erin's face! -Generally all the randoms met...And there were many (Brendon the plumber from Canberra calling the toilet a shit shoot). -Coming home to deface my fridge Perth style with buntine...Then continuing to laugh myself to bed for laughings sake (Furze and poodle you know what I mean!) In conclusion, what a pearler of an evening....Will go down as a fave.  As will the last week. Hope all are well. hooroo x

      The world is becoming more human.  Well maybe not so much  the  world, but certainly  my  world.  People are talking more. Its nice to talk to people you don't know and find out stuff and learn from them. Our greatest resource, afterall,  is  other people. I've only just truly learnt this lesson in the last 24 hours. Just thinking about all the wierd and wonderful people I've met in that small space of time, and how I learnt a little something from each one of them.  Its so much easier to talk to and understand people when you're comfortable with who you are. Its so strange how people build up all these walls just to protect themselves from other people. This is probably why I'm enjoying it so much, because I've only recently become comfortable, I mean I had to go through hell and back but it was worth it. Now I realise that all the things I thought were problems, weren't really, they're just stuff that happens around you that passes in time and you out-grow it. I realised this walking home from the train station today, still drunk at 10am. And although I had black eye make up smeared all over my face, and my hair was pointing in several thousand directions, and my cowboy boots were giving me blisters.... I decided not to wait 20 mins for the tram but to walk instead, and then when i got to my street and the tram i would have caught went zooming past me.. i just smiled.

I hope its true Shaynal.

      Well I said I was gonna get Rock n Roll wasted... I certainly Rocked and I certainly Rolled over outta bed today to spew my Scotch Love into a nearby bucket ....... all day. But myeeehhhhhh it was worth it!! So I went to Revolver for Indie Initiative and I might go so far as to say it was the BEST one yet. Unfortunately I missed the first band:  Sojourn  but made in time for the others:  The Pranks:  I can see why people  love  this band, and why they have such a lively and large following. I must say the audience added a great deal to this awesome performance. They had it all: stompin' good rock songs, quirky rocknroll singer with zany attitude and an awesome strong voice, a cool guy rockin out on the Rhodes......... but this business of 'having it all' only makes me think I've seen all this before. I mean sure, they had great songs, the crowd loved it, the singer jumped off the stage and rolled around on the ground.... but isn't that what everybody does? hmm.... maybe I'm being overly critical, and acting like a typical spoilt little melbourne audience...   The Roys:  In a word: sensational. No! wait! I need more words! It was so refreshing to see people handpicking EXCELLENT influences on their music and turning them into something uniquely their own. This band seriously was one of the best I've seen in a long time. They were like Kings of Leon/Johnny Cash/alternative country/southern rock ... with the vocals and demeanor of Julian Casablancas... and some hilarious facial expressions from the drummer. If you get the chance, go out and seem em.  Yeah so, the rest of the night is pretty much a write-off... the more scotch i drank the less i remember.... and that weed tipped me right over the edge... I do remember being at Pony when it closed and taking 2 random boys with us .. and I do remember driving my car home from Alana's at 9am. And I certainly remember spewing my guts up all day..... didn't get outta my pjs till 6pm.  rock and or roll ciao

I AM A DEMON AND I LOVE ROCK N ROLL! Destinations on the list this evening:  Revolver 161 Flipside @ Republika Cherry/Pony  OOHHHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHH!!!  PS - Straight Scotch is the new drink, G&Ts are so last season. So this means I'm changing my DJ name from DJ Messy G&T to DJ Scotch Love.   Audi.

        MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR!   Yes, in another fit of rage and insanity yesterday, I cut all my hair off. I dunno what happened really, one minute I was calmly painting, the next minute I was hacking into my hair with a handy Stanley knife, .... then decided if I was gonna hack into my hair I should really do it with scissors.   So the result is, most of my hair being around 3 inches long... but the sides are still touching my shoulders. ok thats not a very good description, but it looks alright, in fact it'd be pretty cool... if I was a boy. Why do I always end up with cool hair for a boy?  Anyways, I guess I'll just have to live with looking like some estranged member of Supergrass or somethin.  BUT IT TOOK ME SO DAMN LONG TO GROW ALL LONG AND GIRLY! oh well.

      check this  I just finished reading that FIGHT CLUB may be getting turned into a Broadway Musical with music and songs created by the Dust Brothers.  At first i thought that this was crazy, but the more I think about it the more it strikes me that this might be an amazing idea.    The worlds first Neo-Facist Post Millenial Break Beat Guerilla Musical.  Kinda Cool!!

One in particular that I bought last year during my obsession with the best city in the world:  YES NEW YORK . Its got so many awesome tracks on it! Including stuff from  Radio 4, The Rogers Sisters, Ted Leo/Pharmacists, Calla, Le Tigre, the Strokes, Interpol, the Rapture, the Walkmen  and  lcd Soundstystem . So fucking cool. Go out and buy it.

      hello friends and lovers...  ... dunno why it's been so long between blogs, I guess i been introperverted or somethin'.  For the record Bumtime, the job you have described is not a job. It's your life. So I guess if yo gettin' paid for that it's cool.  I think a Melbourne holiday is so in order that all it will take is a day of cheap flights anf I'm there.  Especially now that I don't think that i'll be over for Fashion Week (I got offered a really good, meaty, secondment here in perth Production Managing a few venues for the Art Rage festival).  Hope you are all okay...  ...and balls

        Finally, an AWESOME job    Yes, yes thanks to Craig I finally have my dream job. In fact this is possibly what my brain was  designed  to do. In fact, I'm sure I've written here at some stage:   Why can't I just talk and gossip about British bands and popstars and get paid for it?  Well finally the gods have taken a liking to me. Coz that's basically what I'm doing! Yippee! This is the greatest job in the history of the universe! I love it i love it i love it.  sigh. Plus I've finished school for 3 weeks! yay! Time to celebrate by going out and seeing some mu-zac ... possibly the Beings. yes, I think that shall be in order.

      I don't want to make you more depressed little Poodle, because I love you, but something you said has been a matter of intreague to me for some time. The fact that we try to sleep for longer to avoid the day, and is this some non-permanent form of suicide? Avoiding life, sneaking into oblivion in hope that life will pass us by. It reminds me of a confession made by an anonymous English writer in Alfred Alvarez's classic study 'The Savage God':   Both my parents, for different reasons, regarded death as the perfect release from their troubles. Like my father, I have always demanded too much of life and people and relationships - far more than exists really. And when I find that it doesn't exist, it seems like a rejection...  In the afternoons, my mother and father both retired to sleep. That is, they retired to death. They really died for the afternoons. My father was a parson. He had nothing to do, he had no work. I begin now to understand how it was for him. When I'm not working, I'm capable of sleeping through most of the morning. Then I start taking sleeping pills during the day to keep myself in a state of dopiness so that I can sleep at any time. To take sleeping pills during the day to sleep isn't so far from taking sleeping pills in order to die. It's just a bit more practical and a bit more craven. But during those afternoons I used to be alive and lively. It was a great big house but I never dared make a sound... I felt terribly rejected,... their door was always shut. ... And those afternoons went on a long time. Because of the war I went back to live with them, and it was still exactly the same.  If I ever bumped myself off it would be in the afternoon.  The reason is simple: when I'm alone, I stop believing I exist.    Sorry...... that was really really depressing, it wasn't intentional, just something I'm interested in at the moment. But Poodle, I've come to the conclusion that you can't wait for something to happen, you have to make it happen yourself. Think in terms of a slate: with layers upon layers of projects, thinking about one while you're in the middle of something else, always keep the ball rolling, always keep your mind active and progressive otherwise it will fall numb and give in. It is much more exciting and fulfilling to try and fail than to never leave your pillow. And try at a million things! At a million billion things! even if thy're just a floating fantasy that popped into your head oe day, do something about it, talk to randoms in the street, write it down, tell somebody, get excited. Once you start, it will become infectious and wild, and you'll find yourself a whole lot happier than you are now. DO IT NOW!

      This is a call out to anyone else who is a) sleeping in as long as they can to pass time, b) watching a collection of dvd/videos they have seen a billion times to pass time, c) reading cookbooks to pass time, d) is lacking any kind of motivation to do anything but these hideous activities! Yes people, its a vicious cycle when you find yourself at a point in your life patiently waiting for something to begin (like your fucking work experience), and you become depressed because you're not doing anything.  Then you are uninspired and you can't utilise your "free time" doing things because you feel too pathetic and miniscule to attempt anything but the activities i've listed above.   Sorry to be so lame and self pitying...basically just asking if anyone wants to have coffee?.......Guy?

      So.... My Mamma lent me the money for a new canvass. Boy it feels good to paint again, its been so long! Even though I dipped my brush in what I thought was oil paint medium and was actually my wine... then I accidentally took a sip of it ..... oooh nasty.  But I got a good feeling about this one, I think its a winner... its very .... Confrontational, and not in a sexual or perverse way ... For a change.   Something interesting we learnt about at school today: yesterday they released 'Air Express' along with Air Tunes. A device which acts as an adapter to your stereo plug about the size of 2 matchboxes stuck together. What it does is similar to the iTrip (iPod) in its wireless connection to a spare frequency on your radio. Allowing you to play digital music files from your computer wirelessly to and iPodish remote to any stereo/speakers in your house to a range of 45m. The same thing will eventually happen with televisions, allowing you to wirelessly watch movies stored on your computer. The cool thing is they only cost around $50! Finally, technology is becoming exciting again. Just like when the cassette-based walkman was invented to revolutionize the music consumption and experience. Pretty soon (and probably happening now) everything to do with home entertainment (music, movies, television, radio, surround sound, internet, downloading) will be operated from a device the size of a matchbox, tuned into a small notebook computer. Awesome.

      Met this German guy last night who waxed lyrical and at length about how melbourne is the best city in the world and being there was the best time of his life. I´m now officially homesick, and really surprised at myself for it. Didn´t think it was something I was capable of. So tired today I couldn´t even organise myself to see yet another museum, so I randomly walked the streets of Berlin listening to the Datsuns over and over. Think the Berlin police have probably put out an APB by now on a weirdo air drumming furiously outside various city land-marks.   Air drumming is my favourite past time of all time. Any one who ever came to the now infamous (is it now infamous? can we say that?) rockroom will attest to my air drumming enthusiasm, if not quite my talent. truth be told I´m a pretty average drummer in real life, but in "headphones on, air-drum" world I am the love child of john bonham and Chad Smith. My air drum kit is a massive 80´s Tommy Lee style cage with 13 rack toms, 9 floor toms and a double kick. And cymbals, yeah, shitloads of cymabals like on Wayne´s world when garth does that wicked solo...cool. I rule the world-wide air drum scene with an iron fist and I´m constantly being sought out to play on high profile "air-sessions" with bands like Jefferson Airplane, Aerosmith and ummm...AIR. yeah, rock.   God I wish i had a mullet.

      OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD!!!!!  I feel like Bernard in the first episode of Black Books when he's trying to do his taxes and has to reread the question 800 times and still doesn't know what it means and then does anything to avoid it including inviting Jahovah's Witnesses in for a cup of tea and a chat about Jesus.   I've been reading this question for the last 2 hours:   The artist's first album is released by the company on the 31st Jan 2000; the Contract is signed on the 30th April 2000. If two options are exercised by the company, on what date with the contract terminate?  'Option Period' means the period commencing on the expiry of the Initial Period or previous Option Period (as the case may be) and expring nine (9) months after the first cmmercial release in Aust on Records by the Company of the Minimum Commitment for Option Period.   AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH there's pages and pages of this crap. Its not my fault I couldn't pay attention in this class! It was so boring! the only time it interested me was when we got to make costumes at lunchtime and come as our favourite part of a recording contract; in which i made a crown out of sticks and came as Overseas Royalties.   Oh god oh god oh god oh god sweetie.

      I was also impressed by this:   Leno's Voicemail Message Pauses For Laughter  LOS ANGELES—Tonight Show host Jay Leno's home outgoing voicemail message stops briefly to allow for audience laughter, sources reported Monday. "You have reached the home of Mavis and Jay Leno, and if you don't know what to do by now, then you've got bigger problems than Martha Stewart,'" said Leno's recording, followed by a five-second silence. "But seriously, callers, at the beep, leave a message." After a short pause, Leno's message concluded, "Am I right?"  Ok.... now I really gotta do some work.....

      So, we went to see  Justin Timberlake  last night (me, poodle and laurie d). I dunno, mixed feelings. Even before I went a found it a little odd for him to be still touring an album that came out at the end of 2002. I also found it odd that he was playing at  Festival Hall , also known as 'Festy Hole', had I been willing to pay  $140  for a ticket, I would have been very disappointed. Justin was his usual average kinda self, tryin to talk all black but occasionally slipping back into default white boy accent and sounding like Ed Norton.  He was completely overshadowed by his band who were just:  SO .......  FUCKING ....... GREAT  They were the main reason I wanted to go to the gig. Or the main reason I wanna go and see any of these huge Popstars, because they have the most fucking amazingly talented bands in the world. Especially somebody like Justin, whose music I admired purely for the sounds they were using and all the incredible detail that goes into the music when you really listen to it and ignore his wailing over the top of it.    But yeah, thats my cheap thrills for the week, seeing another popstar. Getting all wierded out when girls absolutely screamed a lung out when he took off his shirt (to reveal ....oooooh another shirt). And seeing  Cam Diaz  watching on from the side and having a bit of a boogie, for some reason my brain is telling me that that's kind of special or something.  Anywho, thats that.  now I gotta run and do 8000000 assignments before Wed. So expect an even greater amount of procrastination posts in the next 48 hours.  PS-  I'd like to add that when I offered a ticket to  urlLink Guy,  thinking that he's finished Uni forever and is free to do anything and everything for like ... the rest of his life, he replied 'Hmm Justin, one album, not worth it.' to which I replied 'Not worth what??!! Its a free ticket!! What are you going to do instead?' he replied '  Cher   is on TV, I think I'm gonna watch it, don't tell anyone' well I'm  tellin ! Coz that is the lamest thing like .....  ever!

      Bought the Datsuns album today at Dussman (das Kultur Kaufhaus) for 9 Euro. What a steal! Listening to it now on the ol' pod while on a beanbag at Mitte Backpackers Hostel, watching Greece destroy Portugal in the Euro 2004 madness. The Datsuns are even better than the Greek striker Savoulakis, who is, incidently, wearing a headband. I'm in Berlin, a city that is quickly proving so cool it's intimidating. So many randomly amazing galleries, graffiti and haircuts. The music scene here is unreal and everyone is so sophisticated, but in an unpretentious, bohemian, politically enlightened kinda way. Going to Bastard tonight to see some of the local talent and get rock and roll wasted. At some point I may even close my eyes, sway awkwardly and pretend I'm at Pony...   Quick "rock am ring" report - did the kind of silly thing of spending more time backstage getting pissed than watching bands, but what we did see (from side of stage) rocked the casbah. Jet, Muse, Faithless, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and a bunch of Kraut rock that I can't quite pronounce or remember. Hi light was definetly playing pool with Muse backstage. Chris and Dom were absolute sweethearts. Watching Chris tackle Deluxe (Steve Tucker for the unititiated) to the ground while I poked him with a pool cue will remain one of the more bizarre memories from this trip. Actually even better was returning to camp site only to hook up with some hilarious locals, who showed us how to smoke hash and  do vodka shots with the aid of wizz-fizz. Muchos political discussion ensued, noone hates Bush like the  Germans (or the French, or the Russians, or anyone under 35)    So what the hell is going on back home? I turn my back for one second and you guys let Millsy release an album. Shouldn't you have been waging an orchestrated internet-based hate campaign or something? Slack guys, real slack. Even heard he hooked up with Paris again, what a classy guy.

      After that last post I realised how much shit I've been dribbling recently, also realised I haven't taken my meds for 3 days. So its back to the sweeping generalisations which have made me the hypocritical bitch I am today:  - The Dissociatives' music is over-produced, over-polished wank. When you combine 2 perfectionists like Paul Mac and Daniel Johns you end up with music which is about as interesting as staring at a coffee table that's had a once-over with Mr Sheen.  - Miriam makes me extremely uncomfortable. Her appearance in the Big Brother house was the most distasteful non-event I have ever witnessed. Not to mention how awkward everyone was when Gretel asked her if she was a feminist, to which she blankly stared.   - the kid with the red hair from Harry Potter has grown up to be HOTTTT Diggity Dawg. I'm lovin the whole rock look.  - The Datsuns album is ridiculously good. Unrivalled even... as far as recent rock albums go.   - Somebody should shoot Rob Mills in the temple, then run at his body with an axe, carving up every bloodied inch of him and then stick them in a blender, then drink the puree of his body and then vomit it all over his new record. That's what I think of it.

If the Strokes' music were a food it would be crushed up wafer biscuits, and Julian's vocals are honey being drizzled all over them.  ITS TRUE PEOPLE!

      In the few hours I have the house to myself before my mother gets home and questions my entire reason for existence, I like to potter around the house and do useless shit like, blogging, watching TV (without disapproving looks)and today I sat down to play the piano, something I haven't tried to do seriously for a good 15 years. After simply making noise for around 10 minutes and realising I can't play much but some very basic scales and some little tune about a river, I opened up my piano stool thingy where I used to keep all my theory books. Whoa. Haven't looked in there since I was about 9. I came across a small music exercise book from when I was 6, its so cute. There's all these adorable little scribbled notes in it like:  major = happy, minor = sad ; and  'a phrase is a curved line over the notes, it is a musical sentence' . I remember how much I desperately wanted to be good at piano and how much I would punish myself when I wasn't. Hence the very last page in the book was my first attempt at writing a song, I remember it was the most personal thing I had ever written at the ripe old age of 6 and it was called 'Creating'. I played again today for the first time in years and its the saddest song I have ever heard. I'm pretty sure I quit learning piano soon after writing it.

      I've been listening to a fair bit of Morrissey's new album 'You Are The Quarry', and I dunno if this was the intention, but all I can do is laugh. Everything about it is just  sooooo  Morrissey that it seems like he's taking the piss. And considering this is supposed to be his most acclaimed solo album, that wouldn't surprise me. The funniest thing about it is the song titles, for anyone who was ever a Morrissey fan to have a chuckle at:   I Have Forgiven Jesus  The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores  How Could Anybody Possibly Know How I Feel  All The Lazy Dykes  You Know I Wouldn't Last   and this is a corker... the B-side to the new single (First Of the Gang to Die)   ‘My Life Is An Endless Succession Of People Saying Goodbye’     Ah Mozza. So tortured.  Meanwhile it seems like the NME is still obsessed with him, posting a whole article about his 'controversial' comment at one of his own gigs about wishing it was George W. Bush who'd died instead of Reagan. I mean really, everybody's thinking it!

      Blog has been a thoroughly entertaining read lately. Can completely agree with the poodle point. As distateful as working within the framework of modern society can be, it's hard to turn your back on it without discarding everything it provides. I've never been very comfortable working a set hours job for someone else so I chose/choose not to. That's probably a complete oversimplification (i still got some bosses) but at least it's kind of on my own terms, which keeps me from going crazy. I still get people asking me what I do for a real job but, hey, I'm no slave to the man. I HATE it when I have to get up for work, I mean like, really loathe and despise it.   I think the ultimate goal is to subvert the reality you must exist in order to bring it slightly closer to your own little insane vision. Like Guy said, just inject enough of your own insanity to keep everything from overwhelming you while reinterpreting the modern existentialist reasoning of....J-LO GOT MARRIED AGAIN???? Why didn't anyone tell me this??!!  Ahhh....I can feel blog floating back into normalcy. Guy have you heard the new Britney album?

      Yeah, sorry to open up the 'serious' can of worms, something that isn't often done on Maybe I'll Go Blind. But the reason I've been posting absolute shit lately is because I'm really thinking about this crap 24 hours a day and can't really think about celebrities anymore! What's happening to me? How dare I not be concerned with celebs!!! I didn't even know J-Lo got married til yesterday...... wait, maybe that's coz nobody else cared either.  Indeed Poodle, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being is an excellent book, but somehow I actually feel Milan Kundera is partly responsible for this creeping craziness....... in fact if I read any more of his books or indeed re-read them I think I  will  go insane! I can't handle having anything else to think about! It hurts my head! I say this and then look down at the books I borrowed from the library:   The Irvine Welsh OMNIBUS  (trainspotting, the acid house, marabou stork nightmares)  White Rabbit  - A Psychedelic Reader  'tripping'  with Miles Davis, William S Burroughs, Oscar Wilde, Paul Gauguin etc. and  'On Suicide'  - Great Writers on the Ultimate Question (plath, camus, tolstoy, greene etc)   Catherine - I woulda got out Miller, as I've always meant to read it but I go to crappy NMIT where they've only just realised that books exist.  hmmmm.... don't think I'm doing myself any favours.

      Ok...have thought about your last post in depth poodle, and i do agree.  I have often thought our society is a load of absolute wank, and still do, and why should i have to work?  It can be, and has been, at times soul destroying.  However, it is contradictory to "talk this talk" and then turn around and indulge in every other aspect of society besides work.  No one i know (including myself) works souly for basic human rights such as food, shelter etc.  We work so that we can obtain and enjoy the "fineries".  To buy clothes, cd's, cars, alcohol, cigarettes, computers blah, blah, blah.....Do any of us really want to give those things up?  I suggest if one disagrees so much with the society we live in....go bush!  Ignore every part of it.  I remember saying to my mother at approx. age 13/14 "I just want to go and live on an island, with no people and just catch fish and draw!"  ...Jesus...can you imagine?!!! Think of that film 'Human Nature'! And that thought still comes back to me.  But I am not willing to do that just yet! Despite what some of you may think about me frolicking about in nature! I am currently reading/re-reading 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' and it seems to make everything make sense.  I don't want my life to be "light"...i want some parts of it to be heavy..i want some weight...am not really expressing myself very well here!  But Erin, maybe go back and read over that...it may help. Woah...It's all very serious....

      As far back as I can remember, I've had this sneaking suspicion that I will one day end up going insane. Has anyone else felt that? I've just always felt that my brain is actually capable of insanity, that one day I'll just completely lose it, completely lose the ability to hold it all together. I'm not trying to be my usual attention seeking overly dramatic self here but this is seriously what I've always thought, and I think the moment has arrived.  I've noticed that especially in the last 12 months I've been drifting further and further away from reality. This used to be because I had nothing to do, and thus nothing to focus on. And that extremely brief stint that I did working full time kind of helped because it gave me some kind of false sense of worth. I convinced myself that by getting up at 5am and mixing paint for Tradies til 6pm I was actually servicing my community, I was actually giving back to the society that had supposedly given me so much. I've since convinced myself that this is a load of shit. Everybody is convinced that working is the right, good and honest thing to do with your life. And if you don't do it then you're a disgrace and a bludger and a brat.   The fact that I don't work at the age of 22 is frowned upon by basically every single person I know. The main reason for this I guess, is they see it as me relying on others to get me through life financially, and I should stop being such a spoilt brat and get over it. But there's a larger question here, is our sole purpose to simply arrive at the workplace the majority of us despise to do shitkicking tasks for richer, ignorant people (who are simply doing jobs even richer and more ignorant people) purely to attain this abstract concept of money SIMPLY SO THAT WE CAN CLOTHE AND FEED OURSELVES? I refuse to do that in order to have those simple human rights!   ....     ...  And that brings me back to my point of not being in touch with reality.  ...  This is the kind of shit that is constantly swirling around in my head and its getting worse every day. To the point where I'm completely unaware of my surroundings. Today I snapped out of one of these weird 'thought comas' and realised that lunchtime was over and my class had gone back inside 20 minutes ago and left me sitting there! Getting scared....... not quite sure what to do.

      Whoo-Hoo! REAGAN'S DEAD!  Its so funny, how basically everybody hates this guy,.... well maybe mainly me, and then the news comes out with this:   LOS ANGELES - Ronald Reagan, the  cheerful crusader  who devoted his presidency to winning the Cold War, trying to scale back government and making people believe it was “morning again in America,” died Saturday after a long twilight struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 93.   What a pile of crap.

      Back in Melbourne. And I just remembered that I forgot to stalk the guys @ Perth Rock City while I weas there. Dammit! Anyways, thank you to all of my beautiful perthonalities for looking after me, and giving me a place to stay that wasn't the gutter and for just generaly being the majority of ultra-cool peeps in my life.  In other news.... WHOO-HOO!  Creed  have broken up! Yay! No more god-rock! Now we've just gotta get rid of fuckin  Nickleback .  In more news, my hair looks kind of retarded now that I don't have Piche's Straightener.... I look kinda like Baby's sister Lisa in  Dirty Dancing  mixed with  Betty Page . Hmmm... I know which one I'd rather be.    And finally, I am going crazy styles at bars this week coz I've missed them so, So if you're lookin for me, I expect you'll find me at any of the following: Pony, Ding Dong, Cherry, Revolver, Duke, Sin-e, Weekender, Republika, Pony, Pony, Pony, Pony, Pony.... and Pony.  ciao.

      Yes yes hello. Agghh, I've felt so naked without my precious bloggy. So, yes I am on the westside for one more night only. Any volunteers in Melbourne willing to pick me up at 5am from Melbourne airport? No, didn't think so. So yeah, Perth is kinda cool, but I have no idea how I occupied my time here for 4 years. What the hell was I doing all that time? Am majorly disappointed that they've converted Amplifier into some shit-ass 'sports' bar. That place was like the only cool place Perth had going for it! And no Elanor, I didn't vandalise the Restaurant that stoopidly won 'My Restaurant Rules' But I was pretty bloody tempted. Meanwhile with all the shit-house 'DIY Rescue' style artwork in that place it already looks like somebody has come at it in a pink wife-basha and polystyrene.....shudder..... thats enough vandalism for one place.  And as Poodle pointed out, nobody goes to the Scotsman anymore. I dunno what happened here. But all the magic seems to have vanished. Evaporated. There's no longer a certain buzz that gushes through these flat, rusty, bland suburbs. Instead, there's a shell. A place which once held a group of people who essentially all wanted the same thing. And now, the things those people want have changed, and they've drifted elsewhere. And there's strangers living in that house on Walcott St. And... I guess... that's ok.

      Furzikins...back in four weeks?  Wow that seems quick...mind you, you have probably lived 10 lifetimes per month away! Will b great to c u.   Still rockin out in perthy, havin some fun, drinking far to much...tuesday involved boozy lunch, one bottle of wine to myself, and dinner, bottle of wine and bottle of champas, then post dinner cocktails, half bottle of gin!!  Consequently i was severly hungover and ill on wednesday and could not have anything to drink, meaning no scottsman action.  Poor erin then had no one to drink with at the scotty as everyone else had bailed.  Not a happy lady.  Perth is in her bad books. I'm still lovin it though and will b sad to say goodbye again.  I do kind of miss the bright lights of the big smoke... melbournes night life is A1...perths is below sea level!  Oh well enough from me. Ps cheer up poodle xoxo

      Hi gang, just a quick note to say I'm alive and well and temporarily relocated to Amsterdam. Beautiful city, lots of canals, mary-jane, bridges, cafe's where you can buy pre-rolled joints, 300 year-old architecture, weed, museums, galleries, "A" grade skunk, jazz, spliffs, trumpets, angels...oh you can also get marijuana here.   It's a really fun city, probably the most liberal bunch of people I've ever collectively met. And not just liberal in the "h my god they've legalised hookers and soft-drugs" sense, but also in the "golly gee they believe in a moderate government that gives everyone great healthcare, scaled taxes and looks after the old, sick, drug addicted and poor" kind of way. Kind of a lefty utopia, even though I'm assured that there's plenty of right-wiongv tendancies under the surface. Imagine perth but with legalized drugs. Shit, I just described the WAPA utopia.   Still I'm not here long enough to find out. Off to rock im ring in germany this weekend. Not going to post a lineup because a)you can look it up for yourselves and b) If I do Erin will have another coniption and I'll get abusive SMS messages for days. Needless to say should be fun.   All this perth blog talk is making me miss you guys. Coming home in about 4 weeks, so keep a few beers on ice for then.  love to all

      aggggghhhh I hate my computer and its stooopid virus!!!  Anyways, after watching last night's rage it dawned on me how incredibly lame Sydney is... I mean how many good bands have they produced in the last say... 3 years? Besides  Youth Group ? If anyone suggests  the Vines  I'll remind you that I said GOOD bands.... huh? huh? None. That's right. Then another thing dawned on me, the only good music in this country, is comin outta Melbourne or Perth. And thats just bizarre. ... let me just back that up:   Melbourne:  Jet Ground Components Riff Random British India Spazzys etc etc etc   Perth:  Eskimo Joe Sleepy Jackson Little Birdy (ggrrrr even though i hate them) Gyroscope (even though I hate them too) ehhhh Perth Rock City  Anyways, I'm proud to say that I've, at one stage, made both of these wonderful towns my home..... sigh.....  In other news  Franz Ferdinand  are hosting Rage tonight! whoo hoo!!!!!

      Indeed. Franz Ferdinand certainly have blessed us with their kick-ass, action packed live show. Let us all bask in the golden light that miraculously shines&nbsp;from their remarkably unfashionable 1980s haircuts and superb guitar-dance moves!  Oh what a night.... the music and heat stifling every breath of fresh air in the house ... the crowd: a ferocious ocean swaying, jumping, gulping down its victims as they stretched out to touch those almighty sexy Scotsmen............ the kinship amongst audience members as they made room for their lungs to expand enough to&nbsp;shout out lines like "you're sexy, I'm sexy, so come and dance with me Michael" and going absolutely spastic whilst screaming 'THIS FIRE IS OUTTA CONTROL! I'M GONNA BURN THIS CITY!"... that random dude lifting me up to surf over the crowd proclaiming my longing to have sex with the bass player ............. ahhhhhhhhhhhh...... sigh..... fun times...   and many more fun times ahead......... Datsuns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO EXCITED!

      I'm really concerned about this Sony/BMG merge, its becoming dangerously clear that we're one step closer to the concept of 'THE Record Company' wherein all majors will have merged to collectively sack thousands of people and use their monopoly to further rip-off the artists.  It is kind of a strange merge though, I mean, I always thought of Sony as a cold, heartless money-making machine, not concerned with the welfare/longevity of the artist, whereas BMG seem more Artist oriented... Maybe I've just been brainwashed by Australian Idol.  But what has emerged as a more hilarious strategy to combat&nbsp; downloading and its threat to Record Companies, is BMG have come up with the ridiculous concept of selling High, Mid and Low price versions of the same CD. 'High' have all the pretty artwork that people&nbsp;pay to get and Low having absolutely no artwork at all. HELLO!!!!???? That is the most fuckin stupid thing I've ever heard!!!  A) As if anyone is gonna pay $14 dollars for a CD (specifically from BMG) without artwork when they could much more conveniently download for the same or even lower price (if legal at all).  B) what&nbsp;Artist is gonna want their product sold for $14 looking like shit, stripping them of artistic integrity&nbsp;and blatantly exposing them solely as a 'product' for shipping and sales?&nbsp;  C) people only  BUY  CDs these day for the artwork so it won't make a shit of difference!&nbsp;  grrrrrrrrrrr.... its obviously monday.............&nbsp;

      wassup.   so its been a little while since the last post, mainly because I've been driven out of my house since my mother's brilliant idea of have the whole fucking carpet dyed a different colour!! and now it stinks like wet dog.   Indie  was good on Thursday, I'm glad to see  Avenza  have improved immensely since last time I saw them. Seeing  Pixelated  for the first time was also rather interesting. As it is a running joke in my class that if you wanna bag somebody you say they love Pixelated and have a Pixelated tattoo on their arse.  However I am OUTRAGED that  the Beings  are not playing at the  Best Of Indie  in August, Neil's excuse for this: they're playing a gig at Revolver the week before....  thats outrageous!!!  Durrrrr.... they're only like the best Melbourne band like.... ever!  Meanwhile.... won't be drinking Scotch Love for a while as I spent all of Friday throwing up/feeling dead/drunk/half a person.  Can't really think right now so I'm gonna break it down again:   Really Diggin:  Freshly made quater pounders Southbank $10 CD shop (my eternal downfall) the Police (" Sting is a real hero of mine, the music he makes, not that I really listen to it, but the fact that he's making it, I respect that")  The Astor Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a Spider can!   Really Not Diggin:  Scotch Hungry Jacks Double Delish (it had so much promise) Spewin the Smell of my House!!! Pony closing at 1am on Thurday nights.

       Well hi to all.&nbsp; Thought I would post seeing as I haven't in a while, although I don't have a whole lot to say!&nbsp; Went to Rove on Tuesday and got a good glimpse of Franz Ferdinand...Love, love, love them...So good.&nbsp; Once again laughed my tits off during the entire show, there's somethin about that damn studio that makes me giggle like I did when I was 10 and in church and not aloud to be laughing!!!&nbsp; In fact I think I have some kind of problem with laughing...Its out of control these days, once I start I just cant stop.&nbsp; Erin can vouch for this...I think I really scared her last night when I began insanely laughing and could not stop for no apparent reason.&nbsp; And the night before I was supposedly laughing in my sleep and woke her up!!!&nbsp;Better than crying I suppose.    Not working a whole lot...It seems the fume factory have abandoned me, so looking for a new job...Anyone know of anything?&nbsp; Somehow though, after not working for a month, I have saved enough money to pay my rent this month.&nbsp; Wonders will never cease...And my mum will be happy that I'm not sneakin into her netbank and transferring moola across to my account!    On another note, if anyone is looking for some light entertainment this evening, come down to indie initiative at revolver.&nbsp; I'm not referring to the live music, but rather my hilarious love life.&nbsp; It seems that every person I've "shared a moment" with since moving to Melbourne (a whopping 5 lucky people, and I'm not talking about shags...Mostly...Just dirty pashes) is going to be there.&nbsp; Should be interesting, and in the general pattern of my romantic life, fucking hilarious.    Anyway, that is all....    Bye now x

       CURSES!    My fuckin doctor refuses to prescribe me any more Stilnox, coz she's thinks I'm all 'addicted to it' or some shite, so now I'm down to my last 25 tabs of Temaze (coz she won't prescribe me any more of that either) and I hate Temaze it doesn't knock me out like Stilnox it just makes me sleep deeper and longer once I actually get to sleep. So all this means is the insomnia is back in town, and I'm double tired when I have to get up coz I've only been asleep for like 3 hours and the Temaze makes me wanna sleep longer. So for the first half f the day I'm completely out of it so I have to use Mark as a prop to keep me upright during class, to which the&nbsp;extraordinarily immature people in my class make wedding jokes about....... grrrr....... thats my beef for the day.... time for a siesta....

      ooooooooohhhh I love  PJ Harvey  soooooo much.... she's like the definition of sexy rock chick... nobody even comes close to comparing........ love her, just love her.  &nbsp;  AS you can probably tell, I'm enjoying my new purchases immensely, in fact they're the only thing that's getting me through the nightmare of my current painting...... agggggh!!! Its so shit I can't handle it, that chainsaw is lying dangerously close to it..... If only it didn't cost me so much then I probably would hack it up!  &nbsp;  Am really intrigued to know who this  secret admirer  is..... I hope a random comes up and buys me a scotch this week, that'll be so funny! Meanwhile, the shittest bands ever are playing so I doubt anyone will be there..

       Oh yeah... I reluctantly Dj'd Revolver last night, (when I reeeeally wanted to go with Elanor to Die! Die! Die! )   Um yeah Indie Initiative... its getting down to the wire... only a couple more weeks till the big BEST OF showcase in August. Now  that  will be a really good gig.   Last night....    &nbsp;   The Vasco Era   -  DO beleive the hype. These kids were fuckin wicked! At first I was sceptical, as I always am when people hype up bands to me, but fuck! WOW! They didn't win Pushover for nothin folks! I highly recommend you go out and see them, very very talented guys. (they'll be back for the BEST OF)  &nbsp;   Quarterlife Crisis   -  Great name, not so great band. Don't get me wrong, they&nbsp;were great at what they did ... wishy washy melodic triple m ballad rock... not my cup of tea but a very polite bunch of boys.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Zoophyte   -  I can't believe I dug a band with a didge. Maybe I'd had a few too many scotch loves but these guys were actually pretty cool, even though the singer thought he was Brandon from Incubus. I mean, they didn't quite excite me, but they certainly interested me.

After walking around JB with a shortlist of around 15 albums in my hand, I eventually narrowed it down to the following:     &nbsp;      PJ Harvey - Uh Huh Her

        MY MEMOIRS A Tale of Summer Past   Crackers has requested that I write a little summary of what we did last Summer. Just to look back and have a little chuckle over. So here we go, gonna have to do this in point form of the things I remember most clearly: - Day ONE: The Big Day Out, where I met Crackers for the first time. I remember sitting there whilst he Andrew were mumbling something towards each other then suddenly Furze goes "Gee Erin, you don't like Cocaine do you?" I reply in mega sarcastic monotone "No Andrew, Cocaine is  not  my favourite drug of all time"  And it was all downhill from there. Best Big Day Out ever. - Getting a driver to pick us up from the Big Day Out! The most outrageous thing I had ever done at that point - Convincing Benno to come to Revolver by promising him a dirty pash - Grove driving us to HiFi for Muse the next night, completely out of heads. Me freakin out looking at Furze whilst Crackers talks business with various huge Industry people. - Having an orgasm during the concert, then freaking out when the guy next to me has an epileptic fit. - Blurting out my favourite line whilst wasted "I wanna trash a hotel room!!!!" and Crackers replying to my surprise "yeah Let's do it!" .... so we did - Furze cracking it at the Westin reception for not giving us good porn ... on time - Me being ultra pissed off, having to DJ RockRoom whilst furze and Crackers are at the Strokes, they come in off their face of course and do lines behind the dj booth. (JUST OCCURRED TO ME I HAVEN'T GOT OUT OF THE FIRST WEEK YET!!) - Julian Casablancas cracking the shits and storming out of the Marriott hotel he he he so funny - Various nights out with Grove the Driver to Honky Tonks, Cherry, Pony, Ding Dong etc lots of expensive champagne and drugs flying around. - My Birthday party which was just tooooo outta control for words!!  But I'd have to say my all time favourite memory f the extravagance of summer is: Poodle sitting in a massive suite at the Westin Hotel, in a hotel bath robe, stubbing out her cigarette in a Pringles container, then freaking out coz it wouldn't go out. Furze's solution: pour a bottle of Moet into it.  Hilarious. The End .... or is it?

        Am I turning EMO?   Its been a long running joke in my class to tease people for being Emo. Whenever the guys say something to suggest they're little more sensitive than your average 'hardcore/strait-edge/metal/punk' taunts of 'Emo! Emo! Emo!' are thrown accross the room. Such is life in the School of Rock. But regardless of what shit I may get for it, I've found myself slipping into Emo life. I'm wearing my glasses more often than I really should, wearing a lot of stripey scarves and re-realising the brilliance of  Ben Kweller's  'Sha Sha' album. Hopefully this is where it ends. I pray god I don't end up crying over an accoustic guitar listening to  Dashboard Confessional . Then I really would be on the lower end of the music industry class food chain.  Its such a funny phenomonon, Emo's been around for a pretty long time and people are only naming it now and fitting a uniform for it. Its getting a little difficult to write any more on this subject as my stereo has just changed discs to Gerling, its screwing up my thoughts on the matter.  ps- hi Tiff! good to have ya back!

      Yo. - I've had a disturbing amount of people suggest that I audition for next year's  Big Brother .  Why?  I don't think I'd be that intertesting to watch on an every day basis, and plus I'd be the totally non-blonde, non-beach, non-queensland, non-pink clothes, non-good looks that everyone evicts in the first couple of weeks. Plus there aint no way I'm EVER wearing a bikini /nor going nude so you can count me out peoples!  - Loving  Australian Idol  being back, but majorly embarrassed at the amount of shit Melbourne churned out for the first auditions. Meanwhile  Dicko  remains oddly attractive.....  - CAN'T BELIEVE  'THE PRICE IS RIGHT'  IS FILMED IN MELBOURNE AND NOBODY TOLD ME! I'm totally going! So excited! mental note - wear a good bra.   - I'm DJing  Revolver  again this week kids so come on down Thursday for the following bandy treats: Vasco Era, Quarterlife Crisis and Zoophyte (meanwhile I'm gonna try n' leave early to get to Pony in time for Die! Die! Die!)

      Some days, in fact  most  days, I wonder why I bother going to school. I mean today was a classic example of what a shambles my course really is. And considering my last course was a shambles as well I think it just has something to do with Tafe really being as slack as its reputation. Today we had nothing to do for an hour because our lecturers didn't bother thinking up anything to teach us, so we went for a cruise around Collingwood trying to find a  Club X  so that I could prove to Kate that 3-way Dildos exist. We came back and the other half of the class was watching  Oprah  in the Classroom, for like an hour. Then our Lecturer finally rocks up and goes, "ok let's start a new Module, who can tell me what a  band Manager  does?"(!!!!) My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe he was being serious. Then he went on to ask equally as challenging questions like "What does  Marketable  mean?"   WHAT AM I DOING HERE?  THIS IS SUCH A RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME!!!

I know I've said this before, but this is official:  I have never EVER been so fucked in my life. NOBODY in the WORLD has ever been as fucked as I was on Saturday night.    And I have one person to thank: Crackarini.   He has demanded me to give a full report, but to be honest I really can't remember much at all. I can only remember snapshots, they're like little photographs in my head.  Here's what I remember: - scotch love - lots of substances - the house of crackerini - drag queens - finding the only gay guy who likes muse - sitting on the floor in the toilets, talking on mobile to andrew, when I see my phone bill I am going to die - blatant name dropping to get into the MARKET! (gay club for those who don't know) - looking for a guy to set up with the boys and managing to talk to the only strait guy in there - smoking a joint at 8am - really yummy salad the next day  Here's what I've been told (and can't remember any of): - there wasn't a second when I didn't have a scotch love in my hand until around 7am - I was talking to ugly guys - the entire gay scene in Melbourne has my phone number - I was found throwing up into the men's urinal at the market, standing up, next to guys taking a slash (didn't want to admit that but it has to be said) - couldn't find the stairs - passed out in the cab - Kim wanted to leave me in the gutter - spewed into a bucket when we got home  There its been said, now lets never speak of it again. Fuckin great night though, loved ever second of it! thanks crackers!

      Ez,  after the barrage of abuse I received after admitting my passion for Big Brother, I can't believe you have backflipped!!! In true Erin style!!  Now the series is "interesting"... outrageous  maybe we will have to have eviction nite parties and what not, as I have always been an "open" fan of big brother (even when it is not uber cool) he he  later  PS, info for all- am now officially back home, the dream is over, and romanitc idea of living with my parents is quickly fading into long internet sessions and lockup time in my room!

      I'm really quite proud of myself. Last night I managed to thoroughly entertain myself without spending money and without getting drunk. I owe it all to an awesome LP video I found with the following on it:  Standing In the Shadows of Motown Sweet Home Alabama The Laramie Project Iris   Followed by a healthy dose of 3 hours of  Rage  which I might add was sensational. Highlights: the cure, the veils, the hives, butterfingers, and the killers.  Now I'm gonna go eat my multi-award winning sandwich* and watch my illegal dvds of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 (I mean, they're  not   mine)  *   disclaimer : the awards mentioned were presented by me to me, in my kitchen, 20 mins ago. The sandwich in question was awarded the following: - best new comer - most outstanding performance in a sandwich plus - Diet Dijonnaise was awarded best performance in a supporting role.

        SO EXCITED!!! Finally an awesome band worthy of buzz    So me and Poodle are sitting in the DJ booth waitin to start, when this typical Emo kid (including classic fake black frame glasses) comes up and says 'Hello', so I say 'Hi', just then one of the badges drops off his jumper, (I presumed it was a Get Up Kids or Dashboard badge) he awkwardly picks it up, says 'sorry' and scuttles off. So me and Poodle have a little giggle about this.  Meanwhile, about an hour later  HE'S ON STAGE,  fronting one of the  most kick-ass and exciting bands  I have seen in a long time. He's jumping around like a maniac, screaming into whatever mic was working, getting tangled in leads, jumping off the stage, falling over, yelling away to some of the tightest, awesome punk/rock/I dunno what, songs I've heard. The music was just like a fantastic conglomeration of divine screeching, driving and powerful sounds, using vocals as a more confronting instrument than a rockin guitar.  They're called    Die, Die, Die    And they're from New Zealand and they're doin some gigs around town for the next couple of days,  think they're at the Tote tonight. If you like music, and you think you're down with the kids,  well you're not until you've seen this band.  Its simply something you MUST do before you die ..... die, die

      It kinda disturbs me that by using Blogpatrol, I can find out almost everything about anyone who views this site, what they searched for, where they were referred from (yahoo, other blogs etc), what operating system they used (Windows xp, macintosh etc), what browser (explorer, navigator etc), their screen resolution !!! (1024x768 etc), their internet/computer ID, even their colour level (32 bit etc)........... so basically I know everything about you! YEAH YOU! hehehehehehehehe....  wait.... this means other people know all about me, and possibly more coz their smarter than me, and have better, more advanced programs than crappy old free blogpatrol........ ehhhhhhh BIG BROTHER!!!!   Meanwhile, speaking of  Big Brother , is it just me or is the series actually interesting to watch this year? Or am I just really bored. I dunno, its not like they're doing anything exciting in the house, or anything at all for that matter, but I've found myself really enjoying watching the people who are left in there. I think I really like em all, even Paul's growing on me! and I don't give crap about Wesley, I mean sure he's boring, which is cool because it means we don't have to see him! I'm scaring myself here.  abort.   ps- come to revolver tonight!

      I've rediscovered the wonderful world of  Trivia Nights !!! So much fun! Man I knew there must be more things to do in the world that are both fun  and  free. Even though our team didn't win over-all we got a few individual prizes, I personally won the 'Battle of the Sexes' sidegame which won me a free pot! yeah! What's really funny is quickly knowing exactly who to phone to get what answer (cheating basically, everybody does it!) I'd like to thank Laurie for letting me know  Passions  is on channel 7, Poodle for having the  Dirty Dancing  soundtrack on hand to let me know who sang  Big Girls Don't Cry , and my dad for last year's Melbourne Cup Winner. Of course it was truly my time to shine with the question: "Name this song, the artist covering it, and the original artist" Within literally 1 second of the intro, I flung myself across the table grabbed the pen and scribbled: "Bizarre Love Triangle, Frente, New Order" AHHHH if ever there was a question for me, truly that was it.  good times, good times.

      how come no-one blogs anymore.....apart from of course you erin, think if you were away from a computar for more than 24 hrs it would be like disabling the life - support from your body.  anyway perth is overcast and rainy, no more tropical cocktails for us until winter passes in probably about a week.  Myself i have been celebrating the end of my first financial year, just getting down with the accountants and tax collectors....no not really, and also celebrating the regaining of feeling to the left side of my face after the removal of my teeth ten days ago. so yep that is pretty much my week in summation. riveting i know.  Went to dinner with some girls from school i hadnt seen in over two years on saturday, which was to say the least interesting. probably more for me than for any of you so i won't expand. just wanted to make it sound like i had stepped out of my house in the last week.  ps my house is having a new kitchen put in, and has rekindled my number one hate in life - demolition noise and dust and not being able to find anything or eat anything or...........that's it im going out for breakfast - bye.

      Well I really have no excuse not to blog now, as I am currently typing this blog on my brand new, blisteringly fast and powerful Macintosh Powerbook...  But in light of the fact that Marlon Brando has died, I will refrain from saying toomuch for now and resume my silent vigil for one of the greatest actors (and eaters) in the history of the craft.  Marlon Brando, we respect you...

      As I haven't been doing anything but laying on the couch coughing up chunky custard, as my lecturer Graham would put it, there isn't that much to write. Except for the fact that I can't believe  Jack Black  plays Sean Penn's brother in  Dead Man Walking,  I never realised that before. I love  Sean Penn , there's something so oddly attractive about him, especially in that role, ehhh I'm a sucker for criminals.  Just about to attempt the biggest canvass.... I'm freaking out! I'm totally not convinced of what I'm putting on it so I think I'll avoid it for a while.... Meanwhile.... getting well sick of Melbourne, everyone's in such cool places, Prue - Thailand, Kate - Paris, Furze - Who knows? with all their cool stories and new found excitement for life, that's what I need, I need something different to remind me of how cool the world can be. Because I'm becommiing bored with my outlets to it, like music, t.v, internet, books, nothing holds my attention anymore, nothing compares to feeling it with your human senses. mmmmmmmyyyyyyyeeeehhhh. Never gonna happen, god I complain a lot.

      Jees.... Its nice to see nothing's freakin changed around here!  Furze what happened to you being the foreign correspondent on this here blog? Or have you sunk into London/Greece extravagance?  Meanwhile, I've lost my voice due to a ripper cold/shoreham country air/ too many cigarettes. My voice is now at that weird 'speaking in fragments' phase so that you only actually hear 2 fifths of every word I say. Its kinda cool, even though I sound like a demented drag queen fem-bot.   Weekend report:  Thursday:  Indie Initiative shithouse ska bands, then to Pony lots of Scotch Love and drunkenness  Friday:  Rescue Poodle from strange Italian guy's house where she ended up on Thursday night, then escape to Shoreham with Guy for Project: Evil Angels (ps - guy, read the herald-sun today!)  Saturday:  Attend brother's lame party, then escape to Chapel st. where couldn't get in anywhere decent coz had no money  Sunday:  today. sick. nothin. myehhh.  Currently debating whether to include photo on Blogger profile or remain anonymous

       EHH ...THE KWELLER ... SO COOL   Yes indeedy, its official,  Ben Kweller  is one of the most rockin dudes currently gracing the planet. Just so damn with it man, the swagger out to the stage the slow drawl-too-cool newyork-i'm-really-out-of-it accent. Red and black checked hunting shirt tucked tightly into baby blue jeans with a white belt, the man has got it goin on, and boy can he rock out!! Highlights include 'Wasted and Ready' 'On My Way' 'Ann Disaster' and of course 'The Rules', ehhhh I'm such a singles slut. Meanwhile  Smallgoods  supported, yeah they're ok, but I really don't dig em that much, everytime I see them its as if they've dug out another of their parents  Kinks  LPs and stumbled through the chords, making up a new tune by default. Meanwhile the Emo factor was outta control, even though I totally looked like one of the crowd wearing my dark frame glasses, striped top and angular haircut. Ehhhh Emo.... will never cease to amuse me.  What was also rockin last night was  Flipside @ Republika , man I have gots to DJ there, every song is like the soundtrack to my life, had lots of Perth flashbacks hearing tunes like  Tears for Fears  'Mad World' and  Echo &amp; the Bunnymen  'the Cutter'........sigh... memories....

       OUCH! IT TASTES LIKE ...  BURNING!!!  (I just ate really yummy curry.... damn that burning aftertaste)  ANYWHO.... Its good to see Furze back on the blog, and almost back on the scene, I hope you're aware that you'll be granted absolutely no jet-lag recovery time, coz the minute you step off the plane its party party party!!! Hey and speaking of being back on da blog SHAYNE! quit lurking in the comments and show your face on the homepage you bi-atch, and also, hurry up and get yo' ass to Melb town! Its almost party season! ......... sob sob ..... i miss you so.... (ps - Poo-Poo-Poodle, sorry for raining on your fete.)  Anyways, looks like I'll hopefully be spending all of September at the Forum (sigh.... my fav venue.... if only Muse were playing there .... if only Lees and West cared about their audience's experience) i.e Datsuns, Supergrass, Eskimo Joe w/ Dogs Die In Hot Cars ................ that is, if I miraculously get free tickets to these gigs................ *blink blink*  Speaking of gigs......... sob sob.....  the Streets tonight.............. BEN KWELLER TOMORROW!!!! ... sigh.... Man, I seriously am the most pathetic person in the world when I can't afford $35 to go to a gig......... let alone $11 to go to The Astor double on Friday (Eternal Sunshine/Girl With Pearl Earing)  As my brother told me the other day: .... "[I'm] such an angry person"

       I got a  JOB!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?    A design job that is....   Finally, a legitimate gig, even though it is profit share for an independant theatre company, so i may be lucky to receive about $2.00 payment for 2 months work, it still counts!   So thank-you, thank-you everybody...i'm currently taking a bow...   If it looks like it's gonna turn out ok, the few melbournites i know must come and see.  Think it opens mid oct, i'll let y'all know...    P.S.     HAPPY  B'DAY  MARTY !!!(for yesterday)                  xoxoxoxoxo

      yeah, well given that I haven't posted in nearly three or four weeks you could say that, technically, it's time to post. I'm in New york, why? because I fell in love with the place and, knowing that I wouldn't be back O/S for ever and a day I had to make one final pitstop on my home. And it's been pretty worth it I can tell you. Booya! Like, just amazing. It's just the little things that make New york such a great darn city. Like the pizza, and the cool little deli's on every corner, and the Interpol/Cure/Muse concerts.  And the people you meet really make the place too. Like Gino, the guy who owns the porn store down below the apartment I'm in. Or Sandra who will play chess against you in the park and beat you, as long as you part with a fiver. And Robert Smith, the slightly portly lead singer of the Cure, who was kind enough to interrupt his conversation with matt belamy long enough to give me the time of day at some party on saturday night. Little things like that really make this city just swell. Can't get enough of it. Don't really want to leave. (sigh) I could really wax lyrical for hours but that would be completely boring to anyone who's never been here. Plus I've been really concious that I've only been posting when really good things have happened and I'm desperetly worried that it comes off like gloating. I've actually written some really insightful Bill Bryson-esque travel essays that don't involve meeting rock stars of any description. not sure wether I'm gonna post em here or start another blog.  What I do want to do, however, is see my friends. Like Benno. Ever met Benno? (Ben Hynes this is) If you haven't you are definetly missing out because he the topsest bloke on the planet and a loyal friend to boot. I miss this bloke like sleep, partly because he's the greatest guy to hang out with in the world and partly because he knows me nearly better than everyone else (except Erin) which brings me to...  Erin. The person who keeps this blog alive. the person who backed me up publicly even when it was unwise or embarrassing to do so. The person I love so much damnit I can't wait to get home. The person who accepts me for my flaws as I accept her for hers. Actually both our flaws incude a tendancy to overindulge in a colourful mixture of drugs and alcohol, which may explain the our mutual forgiveness of each other.  also panda I love you, but you knew that already  This post may be a shining testament to not posting while trashed but for the greater good, I'm willing to post anyway. See y'all next weekend. The human hurricane is headed back to australia...aiiiyeeeee!!!

Like who the hell is gonna chose Enjoy The Silence by Depeche Mode except for me??? Obviously Franz. Check it out, as if this list has not been stolen from my 'To Do List Diary':   NEW ORDER, THE CURE, DURAN DURAN, THE CLASH, JOY DIVISION, TEARS FOR FEARS, DEPECHE MODE, PULP, SID VICIOUS, MADNESS, THE SMITHS, VELVET UNDERGROUND, DEAD OR ALIVE, ADAM AND THE ANTS, THE STREETS, THE HUMAN LEAGUE..................  it goes on and on !!!!

       AAAAAAGHHH   I'm so sick of my stupid jaded lecturers trying to crush our optimism! Its our god given right as the youth of today to believe our generation can change the world in some small way. Its increasingly frustrating when we have class after class of middle-aged bitter men saying  'None of the music made today will stand the test of time, nothing which is produced now will ever be re-used in 15 years time'  THAT'S ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT!!!! And I'm sick of arguing with them, one in particular who claims he was a child genius (uh-huh thats why you're teaching at NMIT you smug shit), there's no telling him that he's wrong even though its been proven beyond doubt. And I'm sick of arguing with them, they say the most idiotic things like 'all Hip Hop and Rap is disposable bullshit which won't be remembered in a decade's time' to which I respond 'ok what about the Hip Hop which was made  over  a decade ago that people are still sampling and covering eg  Kutis Blow, Run DMC, Sugarhill Gang, Beastie Boys, LL Cool J  etc etc etc... just because its not appealing to overweight middle class Asutralian white men, doesn't mean you can ignore an entire way of life and extreme popularity amoungst 20 something black americans which are as far removed from you as possible!!! YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!!!!" And then he goes 'What I'm talking about is they will never be as recognised as bands like the Stones the Beatles blah blah... you name one band who are selling out major stadium shows today." To this, once again my jaw dropped and I replied "Are you completely ignorant? there are heaps of bands selling out stadiums! and huge venues  Muse, Franz Ferdinand, Jet  etc etc'  errgh.  I'm tired of fighting with these stoopid-ass 'teachers' who are constantly revealing that they know less and less about TODAY's music industry, and trying to crush our hopes in the spirit of their own failure.  idiots.

You may be at a  Muse/Interpol/Cure  concert but you're also missing out on  Rogers/Crane  which you've seen 5 million times!!! so.... ha! ......yeah!!..... ehhhhh  ok bite me)  Hmmmm methinks there might be more to life than goin to a shitload of gigs, but at the moment I can't really think of what they are... plus I need to save all the pennies i can to buy a DVD player for my room so I can watch  Spiderman  24/7, and learn  all  the words....  Props to  Elanor  for lending me her super-fantastique CDs.... ehhh  Cut Copy  are responsible for getting my lard-ass back into the gym, its just so much more enjoyable walking on that treadmill in time to those smooth 80s grooves ... ehhh Cut Copy how I love you.... meanwhile Elanor,  Def Leopard  went down a treat and you have to come to  Cut Copy  @ the Corner with us!!!
