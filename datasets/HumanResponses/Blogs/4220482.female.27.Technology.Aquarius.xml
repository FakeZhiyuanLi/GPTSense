      A good night sleep from Saturday night till Sunday morning... Aaahhh! Still sleepy.. Cause I took 2 pills of laxative before going to bed... In the middle of the night, woke up 2 times to toilet... 1st time was normal passing plus vomitting then diarrhoe-ing.. 2nd time was diarrhoe-ing... ha ha...!! Then, after that went back to sleep... till morning at 6:15am, my mum knocked at my brother's room said that time to wake up... I thought it's me... got a fright.. later, continue to sleep... In the morning, went to Serangoon market with my mum, reached home, swept the floor and mopped the floor... Then, my brother came back home... We drove out to the temple at River Valley for pray pray... next, we went to NTUC at Bedok... finally going back home... I waited till 6.00pm to watch the LIVE of table tennis -- Li JW (SIN)... so sad.. did not enter the bronze award... But at least she has done well... Beaten a lot of good players... That Korean player is making a lot of noise each time she wants to start... Weirdo woman... 'Har!' That was what I heard everytime... or else she can really win the game loh! Then, watched the 'xi yuan lu II'... Then could not stand any more... went to bed now... bye bye...

      This morning over-slept.. woke up at 6.50am.. (actually supposed to be off....) quickly rushed to work without bathing... yucks... Miss Dirty Cha Boh.. Ha Ha!!Had a very bad headache in the morning... but I tried to bear with the pain... when I reached school, first thing is to on the PC and put the Tablet PC Road Show message on the TV messaging system... The pain was still killing me... I asked my Ibu to apply axe medicated oil on my fore head... no cure still... Mrs Tang gave me a 'mian jian kueh'... very hot, very delicious... after that, went around the school to stick the direction signs for Tablet PC Road Show... Back to TA office to do my AAD design causeI am meeting Dorothy.. Guess what? She bought curry puff and chicken pie! Oh! So nice! Then, can't stand the pain.. took my 'blue medicine' for pain killer.. slightly better.. Finally, I have finished all her stuff... sent by courier for printing... by then, the time was 11:45am... Off, I went to Thomson for tuition the sisters... today another long day... so tired... Waited for bus 93.. shit.. so long... finally reached home liao... so gald... Aiyah! The time now is 10.58pm... I am tired.. bye bye.. sleep mode now...

      Wow! How time flies!! It's a week sunce I started my blog.. Happy 1 week anniversary... to my 'siaochaboh' blog!!! Ha.. Ha.. :) As usual, I continue to design Dorothy's AAD brochure (so call lah!) Carolyn showed me someone's picture - printed on paper... Promised her not to mention... Bi Zhi entered the Helpdesk room.. Then followed by Shan shan.. then followed by Pei Ting... follwoed by Wan Qi.. followed by Sec 1 students having problems with their tablet PCs... followed by time's up! Time to close the Helpdesk and go down to TA office.. Still designing the AAD brochure... made some changes here and there... Finally, can showed Mrs Lee... Dorothy went to show Mrs Lee... I went to Boon Lay to give my cousin tuition... I really don't understand at all.. Why all Normal Tech (NT) students behaviour is so sucks.. attitude is sucks... discipline is sucks... I told him to memorize the formulas for Areas and Perimeters... 30 minutes of revision.. and then gave hime a test.. Nothing! He learnt nothing at all!! All he knows is to play, eat, watch TV... etc I said I am not teaching him anymore... I called his father, my uncle that I am giving up.. I am going to stop giving him tuition... See how he survive on his own.. I wait for his call.. if he calls me or SMS me to go back and teach him, I also want to re-think... Just finished redesigning the back page of AAD and checked through the things.. Everything seemed fine.. But still got to go back on Saturday to work... got to go and sleep.. bye bye

      Wow piang weih, early morning 5:56am received 2 calls from the same number... I thought it was a prank call.. Wow, today is a 'shiok' day!! I called Muchtar and check if he was coming cause I need to prepare for the chairman from IDA... He as usual... no not coming... so irresponsible... Hence, tech helpdesk is closed for one day! But, of course, I need to return the repaired tablet to the students... so run up and down the whole school... like 'siao cha boh'.. that's why I called my blog as 'siao cha boh'! I lied to Franics Tong about the projector in the conference room.. I told him to come hurriedly as there's a meeting from IDA is coming.. ha.. ha.. Luckily problem solved.. he want to kiss me... aaahhhhh!!! Then, Wee Suan called, the chairman is unable to make it... Yeah!! Happy siah...!!! Then, after that I continue to design Dorothy's AAD programme sheet... Then Bi Zhi, Shan Shan came to TA Office.. Kelvin was there too... Then all laughed and talked and joked.. so happy... like those days in USSS... Then, when the time is up, all left.. I was waiting for Bi Zhi cause she went to look for Peiting... in the band room.. Then Sherman drove pass the school gate, he asked if I was going to Bedok.. I said yes! He sent me to Yvonne's home... for tuition... Thanks Sherman.. you are the best! I like you... Chee Keeng also very good lah! Unlike 'big fat pig'... ok lah, very tired liao! got to go.. bye bye...
