         It's Monday and I just am having a hell of a time waking up! This weekend, we drove down to Pine Mountain, GA to meet one of my best friends and her family. I haven't seen her in just over a year - when I went down to help her when her baby was born!!! She's grown up! A year old now. Anyway... driving down Friday afternoon and evening, then a full day on Sat., followed by a full day on Sunday and driving home.. well, I'm a bit tired. For those of you who may not know, our "family" vehicle is my F-150 Ext-Cab. It's a 5-speed, no cruise control! And I do the vast majority of driving.  Hubby doesn't drive to suit me most of the time, so I just drive!  LOL Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my truck, but our family has outgrown it for road trips. I rode in the back seat for a few hours... OMG... it's like a freekin CHURCH PEW! Hard as a rock on your butt and the back is straight up! sheesh. Who designed THAT? Heck, I'm thinking we'll get the driver's window on the car fixed (it won't roll up and down) and take it on our next road trip... and it don't have A/C ! Whew.. It was one of the shortest road trips we have taken in a while, but dang, the ride was tragic!  I shouldn't complain. We made it safely. There was a nasty accident on our way home and at least one person didn't make it. Semi, Motorcycle, Jeep, and other vehicles. Not a good combination. So, praise God we made it safely... and I mean that sincerely!  Ok, we went over to the Callaway Gardens. That's a cool place. The butterfly thing was awesome. You go in this glass dome thing and it's HUGE! There are butterflies everywhere! All kinds. They were beautiful! Literally, thousands of them! Of course, bc had to be dragged out kicking and screaming! lol We got to actually see one coming out of its cocoon.  That was neat.   The grounds at this place were absolutely gorgeous!  It was like a little piece of heaven there in the middle of no where.  They have various gardens, some in green houses, some are vegetable gardens (they actually use the veggies at their restaurants) AND, the PBS show "The Victory Garden" is apparently filmed there.  We saw the Victory Garden South, so maybe they have a couple of places they go to to film, but this was definately one of them.  That was neat.    The hotel rooms weren't anything real special considering the price, but it was nice.  The kids actually enjoyed it, I think.  BC did for sure, and GC, well, she seemed to enjoy it.  Having my friend's 15 y/o daughter there too, well that helped too.  Yeah, she's spread them out a bit.  But the older one helps a lot with the baby, so that's good.   I'm sure this seems very chaotic and choppy, but I warned you in the beginning that I was having a hard time waking up.  I'll try to put something better together soon!  LOL  Take care!

      Ok, yesterday we had a yard-sale.  We did ok, but had more left than we sold, so we decided it was time to just part with all the junk.  Hubby loaded the stuff into the truck and we went to give it to the Good-Will.  Of couse, bc had to go with us (he thinks he has to go anytime the truck gets crunk).  As we pulled around to the back of the Good-Will building to have everything unloaded, bc watched, terrified!  They were taking all our stuff!  He turns to me in tears, signing that we need our junk back!  Put it back in the truck, he tells me emphatically!  As I try to explain that we do not need this stuff anymore, he decided to change his tactics.  WAL-MART, AGAIN!  he says.  What??? Wal-mart again?  Then he goes on to explain that we need to go to Wal-Mart and get new stuff, again!  NOW!  God forbid we not have the house bursting at the seams with junk!!! Bless his heart, he was so devestated that we could not immediately replace all our junk.  Ah, the innocence of youth!

      Let me preface this by saying that since this IS my blog so my opinion rules here but no hard feelings if you don't agree with it, just understand (in here) you're wrong! LOL  That said, let's address our governmental welfare and licensing systems. What's up with these. Originally, the welfare system was a good idea for the time but it WAS intended to be a temporary measure to help people through the Great Depression and following years. Then again, back then people took care of their "own" so to speak. If a family in the church or community had a need, the church or community would step up and provide for that need. We don't like to get that involved with people now. Our society is more of a "smile and say hi as you pass" type now. We don't want to stop and get to know one another and IF we DO get to know one another, heaven forbid we share our "dirty laundry". Sure, we will sit here and say "not me! I'd love to know my neighbors and help if I can" but when is the last time you went out and made it a point to meet them?  Ok, that said, we probably do need a welfare system but as a person who has used our welfare system, I can say - without doubt - that it is royally F***'d UP! If the object is to give a helping hand to those in need thus enabling them to become contributing members of our society then we should help those who are trying to help themselves, right? But NOOO! Not us, we only help those who are not willing or able to help themselves.   The stereo-type of people having more babies to get more money is true.  And if you want to just have the one or two children you already have and maybe get an education to get a job where you can afford to raise your family on your own, look out.  It's a full-time job keeping up with the appointments they have you come in for.  And that leads me to the licensing departments...  You have to license your business, your cars, your pets.  But if you have a kid, well, who gives a care?  Whether of not you can care for those children properly, oh well.  Have another.  Maybe by the time your kids start having kids you'll get it right.  Having been in the educational system some, I've actually been told by parents that their children were MY problem in school and if they can't behave or do their work, it's MY problem and do NOT bother them again!  Yes, these types of people are allowed to procreate.  If it was their DOG crapping on my lawn, the law would take the dog but their kid cuts up or refuses to work and prevents other children from learning, so what.  Who cares?   So, how do we fix this?  First, put birth-control in the water or institute a reversible surgery or something (hey, I'm the supervisor, not the Dr.) and make all people, men and women, temporarily sterile.  Then,  when you're ready to have a kid or two, you apply for a license.  If you're on welfare, NO MORE KIDS until you are supporting yourself and the ones you have.  We'll help you get an education or training to enable you to get a job you want to do.   If that job happens to be a low paying job, fine.  You're really trying, working full-time, etc.. then you can have some help with things like day-care, rent or mortgage payments, etc... Help those who are trying to help themselves.  For those who don't want to help themselves, fine.  Put them all in the "projects" and after a while, we'll have them weeded out of our society because if they can't procreate, the cycle stops!  Whatcha reckon?

       Well, I'm gonna enjoy playing with THIS new toy for a while! Of course, there's about 100 other things I could (some would say "should") be doing but hey, the dishes will still be there when I get thru here... unfortunately. Speaking of dishes... what is this "domestic" gene? It must come along with the shopping gene because I sure as hell ain't got it. Housework... ugh! It's like the same shit different day, all the time! Who decided and where is it written that homes must be model perfect if you plan to be "Mother of the Year"? Ok, I think I'm a pretty good mom, not the best maybe, but pretty darn good. But since I don't keep the neatest of homes, some people think that I must not be a good mom. Mind you, we do NOT have unwanted bugs or other creatures scurrying around the house but we do have a lot of clutter. Sometimes the sink is full of dishes that need to go into the dishwasher (how do people live without one of THOSE????) or the laundry piles up in the bathroom or bedrooms cause no one has gotten to it for a while, but durn, why should I waste my time doing that when I can make a memory or 2 with my children or take a nap?? Life is short, eat dessert first!  **Ok, now I've had to save this as a draft 3 times now so if the timing seems a little odd, it's 'cause I keep coming back and adding to it.**  And who decided that when you get married and/or have children you have to like suddenly become a dull, boring, homebody? Think back to your childhood... that kid with the "really cool" parents... what made those parents so cool? It was that they did stuff. They went away for the weekend and if you were lucky, once in a while they'd take YOU so your friend (their child) had someone to play with when they went out at night. And they talked TO you, not AT you. Listen to yourself sometimes, which do you do most? And if the opportunity suddenly arises, do you run off and leave the spouse and kids home for a day or two? Or do you stay home and do your chores like a "responsible" adult? Not for me! I do NOT want to grow up if that means giving up "my" time or choosing boring chores over fun. If that makes me irresponsible, so be it. What do you think?

      Ok, I figured out how to post another entry.  Now, when I get the time, I'll do it again and share more of my never ending crisis I call life with you!  Off to make the bc do more homework!  Uggghhh!  What a challenge.

      Where to start?  It's been an eventful summer, from way high to way, way low and very very long!  Eight weeks of no school started out fine, thought we'd send the boy-child (bc) to the state deaf school (he's deaf if you didn't know it).  Went to the summer school they offered and realized, with a bit of a shock, that the "autism" he'd been recently diagnosed with was a lot more of an issue than we'd chosen to believe.  So, got that plan changed.  The girl-child (gc) went on vaca with the ex.  That went over like a lead balloon.  One week and she hated most of it.  The step-mom got a new puppy.  Realized that the puppy ranked over the child (and the ex too, for that matter).  Rude awakening for her.  She later went down to FL to stay with the Grandparents, and the ex some too.  Was good for her, she got spoiled, as usual.  Thank God for G'parents!  No school clothes shopping for me!!  Whoopie!!!  I did not inherit the shopping gene.  Got the "spend money like there's no tomorrow" gene, but not the shopping one.  There IS a difference.  But, when she came back, she lost her durn mind!  Had to have the cops come out the day b4 her b-day, nearly took her away.  At that point, it would have been ok with me.  But hey, she IS my child.  She gets the crazy honest.  Hubby got to go for the 1st "mini-vaca" with out me and the kids... lucky him.  Of course, I've had several of those, but this was his first.   The bc is always good for a laugh.  His enthusiasm is contageous at times.  Bugs have always been a good obsession.  Last night, the gc gets a wild hair to sweep the back porch.  As she nears the patio table, she notices that the bc has collected a swarm of SPIDERS!  She freaks.  So hubby goes to re-locate the awful mess and discovers that yes, it's a bucket of spiders but they're all dead!  That's a first.  So now, he's not only finding and catching bugs, but he's killing some of them on purpose! Where's THIS gonna lead, I wonder???  This past w/e, we're working on the trees in our yard, downed by recent storms.  As we do not own (and ain't gonna buy) a chain saw, it's been taking us a while to HAND SAW all the limbs and drag them out to the road to be taken off.  So all 200+ pounds of this woman climbs up the branches and limbs, to about 20 feet off the ground, to start sawing off limbs for hubby to drag off.  The bc walks by, sees me up there ( mind you he normally has NO FEAR ) and stares at me with the "have you lost your ever-loving mind, mom?" look.  Then he shakes his head and goes on looking for bugs.  Then the gc comes out.  "Where's mom?" she asks.  "Up the tree" hubby replies.  She finds me and nearly screams "What are you DOING??? You're gonna FALL!!!"  When I assure her that I'm safely sawing limbs, she decides she's gonna give it a go.  Man, you have to love the enthusiasm of youth.  She took over and cut up about all there was to cut up there.  Whew!  Saved from all THAT!  So, I haul my big fat bundle of woman down to the earth again and take over the postion I was made for, SUPERVISOR!!!  LOL   Guess this is enough to start.  Hope you enjoy.
