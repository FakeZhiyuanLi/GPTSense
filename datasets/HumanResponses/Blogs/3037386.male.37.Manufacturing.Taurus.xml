						     urlLink Guess what second and third-rate whiners ...   You are as powerless to decide what President the American people elect as you have been in affecting real lasting change on the planet. Not surprisingly, you are still unearthing fascist UXB's in playgrounds across your land due to the most significant recent death-spasm of your continents influence.   Your way of dealing with Arafat the terrorist (by gifting him a friggin' Nobel peace prize for fucksake) hasn't worked. Obviously...  Although apparently an Arafat mislead Palestinian Authority is OK with you because of your fear of what might come next; After all, it's only Jews that have to put up with daily terrorist bombings and those pesky Jehadis won't hurt us if we give our tacit approval for their methods. No wonder your brightest and bravest emmigrated to the New World. Unfortunately they left behind the dimmest and most fearful.   As far as your fear of the potential for a Hamas or Hizbolla leader being elected (curiously sponsored by the Syrian and Iranian axes of evil), watch and weep once again while their support continues to evaportate as the Americans wage "war on terror".   There will be a new more moderate regime in Iran befor long and even puffy chested Syria will be further chastened by the reality that they don't really matter in the grand scheme of civilized things. As for Iraq and Saddam's Suicide lottery... 2003 baby! America distributes the karmic payback yet again.   With the elixir of President Bush's speech I'm again hopeful. Hopeful, now that some leader finally dropped the cojones to tell it like it is and let it be known that if the terrorist bombings continue and the swarthy ones don't change the maniacal MO of the ME, then one consequence (among many) will be that Israel will be forced to impose Civil control over the territory the Arab nations and their Palestinian stooges lost when they attacked the internationally recognized sovereign nation of Israel. That is... "recognized" ~befor~ the forever whining and inneffective fading Imperialist guilt-ridden nations of Europe decided you could change the very nature and consequences of war and cave-in to the bequest of the blackmailing terroristic Arab nations who not only failed in their bid to "push the Jews into the sea" but even lost ground as a result of their attacks.   Rather you your revisionist braindirtying than stand up with spine enough to call a spade a spade and the temerity to actually have the beef to back it up? No such bullshit for the good old USA. We supply the Beef your kids gobble up at Euro-McDonalds much to your dismay.   You floating on De-nile racist dupes must need whine because you are still essentially powerless to affect change. Just as your fathers were powerless against the Commies and your grandmothers befor were forced to submit to the Fascists but for the blood and will of Americans.   Yet; Ooooo! Ooooo! The poor terrorists deserve a more flexible moral yardstick than does the civilized democratic Jewish nation defending itself!   Thank God (can I still say that word in public?) there is still a nation with the will and the means to solve your appeaser faux-pas in a cultural-suicide free manner.   Notice, the first passage of Genesis was read by the first men to the moon, not excerpts from your favorite Manifesto, nor from Mein Kampf, nor of the Koran.   Sugar coat another crepe and sit back, enjoy the fireworks.   Have a happy Independence Day. ;^)
