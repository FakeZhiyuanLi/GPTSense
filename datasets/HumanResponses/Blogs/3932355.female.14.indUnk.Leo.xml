But it is almost my birthday.I am gonna be 14.Its prolly gonna be really boring tho im not allowed to have&nbsp; a real party just a few friends and stuff.&nbsp; I wish I cood be outside doing something right now.I feel like I am trapped in a box!!!Oh wait I am.LOL my house is shaped like a box. Oh&nbsp; yeah and today i fought with this girl about being a punk.I have never called myself punk and I dont think I am either but she just had to make a big deal. SHE CALLED ME A TRY HARD(meaning poser) and then I told her that she has always called herself punk and she tells people that they dont have a right to listen to that kinda music if they arent punk. ARGH I really dislike her. But anyways I hafta go ttfn.   &nbsp;
