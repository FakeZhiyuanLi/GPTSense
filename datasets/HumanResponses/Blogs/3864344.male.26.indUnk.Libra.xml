						   Hmmm.&nbsp; I've spent most of my adult life complaining about my inability to find a really good job, especially one in my field.&nbsp; I've been "paying my dues" for the past several years in a series of close-to-full-time jobs that have somehow kept my head above water.&nbsp; Now, all of a sudden I'm in a position to consider at least 3 wonderful opportunities, all of which just came out of the blue.&nbsp; I'm not complaining, mind you.&nbsp; I'm just wondering where these opportunities have been for the last few years.&nbsp; Perhaps somebody thought I had some things to learn about life first.&nbsp; I'm glad I've learned them, though I couldn't tell you what they are.

						   Here is a poem I have not read in some time.  We should indeed seek and see God in every aspect of life, not just at our respective houses of worship.   SOME keep the Sabbath going to church;   I keep it staying at home,   With a bobolink for a chorister,   And an orchard for a dome.       Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;         I just wear my wings,   And instead of tolling the bell for church,   Our little sexton sings.       God preaches,—a noted clergyman,—   And the sermon is never long;          So instead of getting to heaven at last,   I ’m going all along!

						   I haven't mentioned yet that among my family, to whom I am very close, is a 5 year old brother.  We've been very excited about a couple of events over the past couple of weeks:  Removing our training wheels, vacation Bible school, the start of Summer, etc.  But this morning topped them all!  He called me this morning at about 8 am to tell me that he lost his first tooth!!! He wanted to tell me right away when it happened (about 4 am), but my mom thankfully made him wait a while.  Well needless to say I was excited with him.  It made me think of how blessed I am to be a part of such a wonderful little life.  I can't remember exactly when I lost my first tooth, but I know it was a pretty big deal.  If only I could derive so much joy from something so minute in my own life now.  Kids have such great lessons for all of us, don't they?

						   Sometimes I see a news report or read a headline that just makes me stop dead in my tracks.  It usually isn't shock value or some grand horror that halts the normal pace of my existence, but something so unthinkably nonsensical that I simply become so confused that I am unable to continue functioning.  My brain becomes so completely overwhelmed by the stupidity of a situation that I cease to be able to think.  Such was the case this morning.  For whatever reason the high school activities association in my beloved state decided to add bowling as a competitive sport.  BOWLING!!!  Are you kidding me?!?! Deserved or undeserved, you may have noticed that Mississippi has a certain reputation throughout the rest of the country.  We are not exactly looked upon as the bastion of progressive intellectualism.  I often complain about the way we're perceived and portrayed, but is it really any wonder?  The once-safe haven of fat, drunken baldness will now be invaded by high school students eager to absorb all that they can from their mentors who have become as spherical as the implements of their mutual diversion.  Let us raise our cans to those fearless few who will not be changed by any "high falootin'" mind-expanding activities like debate or chess, nor anything so physically demanding as soccer.  Let us toast the greatness of those who look progress and aspiration directly in the face, and courageously say, "Awe, hell no!"

						   Wow, I'm behind.  I had to call my 14 year old brother to ask him what the heck a blog is!  His description sounded pretty cool, so I decided to give it a go.  Having been in high school in the early 1990's, I am from that awkward era between the pre- and post-internet America.  Once exposed, I am very comfortable with most things technological including computers and the internet.  But as my aforementioned brother will gladly - and frequently - point out, I usually stand quite far away from the cutting edge.  I do look forward to this new experience, and to meeting some new and interesting people.   Well, here goes. -WB-
