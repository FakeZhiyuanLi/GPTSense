      haha!...lookie lookie!...first first first...  this is actually the first time i'm gonna try out something like this so go easy on me, tei?...  i had a journal before...but since it got lost around the house reel often, i burned it...ehehe...being a pyromaniac rocks, man...ehehe...   story: Pete...  there's this guy, Pete, who felt beri BOBO about somthing...ehehe...it reely bothered him when some things sorta just happen...he dunno why...he thought to hisself that it's just like him to feel that way over something soo trifle so it's otei...yoo know, de ones that sound soo impossible...  it's been almost a year...he was a new student that time...got zero, no, maybe one friend...or two, maybe...after a few days, dees girl, Jana, make lapit-lapit to(haha!co√±o!joke3!) approached him...they always talked in class, in breaks...he remember de time when she called him up at home...he figured it was her the moment he heard le vox of hers...he remembered that she was le one assigned to do de class directory...but she wouldn't admit it...he believed her...so, he was guessin and guessin until he felt stoopid...then she finally admits who she ees...crud...  she always called...he rarely did...well, orayt, sometimes;)...ehehe...  Pete and Jana always together...always laughin...people think somethin's on...though there's nothing, reely...hohoho...they were *bestfriends*...them talkin bout crushes...him spilling everything...thought it would be harmless to do so anyway...then, one day things get complicated...a picture spoils everything...ooh lookie, someone's jealous...a message destroys everything...they go separate ways...  Pete is misunderstood...Pete is bad...everyone hated him...despised him...he was an outcast...and everything he spilled to her, she spilled...oh, how stupid he ees...richard hated her...  an organization they both joined got them together again...but it didn't bring em both "back" together...they never did talk...  One  time, in class, Jana reported about something in a prticular subject...she used a book as her aid in discussing her given topic...since the topic aroused Pete's curiosity, he tried borrowing the book...but Pete just didn't have the guts to ask her directly so he waited for someone else to borrow it from Jana so he that he could borrow it from that person afterwards without her knowing...he was able to read the book...but things went from bad to worse when dismissal came and the book was nowhere to be found!...Jana shouted profanity inside the room!...for the book she used and Pete lost was actually her father's!...Pete kept searching and searching, but to no avail...she hated him even more...things just sucked for the poor asshole that day...  after months of ignoring each other, things changed all of a sudden...no one, not even Pete knew how it happened, but Jana no longer showed any sign of hatred and the likes to Pete...  one day, one of the superiors of their organization decided to host a party for her upcoming birthday...of course they both came...they sat on a curb, Pete's arms around Jana, their hands locked together...Pete asked about what happened in the past...Pete wanted to know the reason why it happened...but Jana didn't want to go back to all that stuff so she just told him frankly that she didn't want to talk about it...He said it was otei...Pete was in love with someone else at that time...or so he thought...Jana asked Pete if he had a girlfriend...Pete, of course said, "no"...so Jana asked Pete if he wanted her as a girlfriend...Pete happily agreed for there was no harm in the idea for they were just really good friends..nothing more, nothing less...  one day, for the first time in their lives, Pete took Jana out...it was purely coincidental because Pete was supposed to have a different date that day...but since she cancelled their date, and Pete didn't want to spend the afternoon alone, she asked Jana out anyway...thay were talking and talking and talking...and when it was time for Jana to go home, Pete thought to himself, "why not?"...and so, Pete he asked Jana if she wanted to go see a movie...  sevral days after that night, Pete started to feel different...he wanted to see Jana all the time...talk to her....hold her...be with her...he thinks it's something...he *thinks*...yoo dig?...  now, Pete mind seems to be spacing out more often than before...thinking what de hell is going on...or is it *heaven*?...he thinks to himself, "is it love? or am i just being driven this way because of her company? am i being honest? or am i just fooling myself?"...he dares not tell her how he feels for he fears that someone might get hurt...  author's note:  this is Pete's story...a story about a guy who is unsure about his feelings...a guy who doesn't know what to do...Pete *loves* Jana...he *loves* her so mats...he wants to tell her...but he can't...this is because he *loves* her so mats that he doesn't want to tell her he does because of his fear that he may be confusing/(insert more appropriate word here) love from like...
