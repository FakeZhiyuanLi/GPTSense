      I have too many thoughts right up in my head with me now that I can't put in words, yet.   Another week has passed.   Funny when you stop and think Time goes fast and then you blink Nothing's ever like it was Girl we've got a special thing And all the happiness it brings Is more than enough I know it's hard to believe You're still the biggest part of me All I'm living for  I still think about you I still dream about you I still want you, and need you by my side I'm still mad about you All I ever wanted was you You're still the one You're still the one  It's hard to breathe when we're apart You're like sunshine in my heart I keep you here inside You've been everything to me You've been and always will be The apple of my eye.  And I know it's hard to believe You're still the biggest part of me All I'm living for I still think about you I still dream about you I still want you, and need you by my side I'm still mad about you All I ever wanted was you  You're still the one You're still the one If you love me, &nbsp;look into my eyes And say you do  I've been waitin all my life for someone Just like you Baby after all we've been through Girl I'm still in love with you And I want you to know I do I do  Still think about you Still dream about you Still want you, and need you by my side Still mad about you  All I ever wanted was you You're still the one You're still the one  -Still by Brian Mcknight  We can't love, without getting hurt, is that the good or bad part?    //Phantom of the Opera//

      "I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;   I lift my lids and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"  -Sylvia Plath [taken from Del's blog (:]  So tonight, well I just received a letter from the Jurong Police Division notifying me that my wallet has been found -beams- its a good thing isn't it! after so long, holding on to my hope. My parents finally found out, because they were the one who read the letter and told me I had a letter from the Police. Owells, its still a good thing they finally got to know what happened even though Dad said most prolly the cash is gone, well if it is it doesn't matter now cuz I've got more important things inside than money. I'll prolly head down to the Jurong West Police Post to collect it tomorrow, or by this week.  Things do seem to be getting better -grins-  School was as usual, I'm getting used to it, almost one month already (: Well, we got to school at 9 this morning, supposed to have our semestral project briefing; save our works on Htmls and our personal web page on a disk and show Mr HAM. But it turned out in the end that I spent 3 wasteful hours last night to do my project because he said, he will check it next time since most of us didn't know what and how to do. A mere 20 mins and there was nothing else to tell us so we had 3 hours off till the next lesson at 12. I could have done with some more sleep at home but NOOOOOOOO we had to come to school at 9 for 20 mins. Bleh. We had C programming and for the first time in Mr Khor's tutorial I fell asleep, well almost because I was struggling to keep my eyes open. Digi Electronics was alright, practical can be fun actually except I was a little lost at the beginning.  Me, Jon and Xing hanged around Food Junction after lesson cuz Jon was gonna go for his Driving at 440, so basically we stayed around before I headed home. I forgot to buy my dinner on my way back cuz mum was gonna be late so in the end, I cooked my own dinner (: hehe, not bad too.  I'm feeling better with every passing day, being more positive about certain things and everything I believe in. I'm tired, and sleepy but happy tonight (:    &if you wished upon a star, believe in it wherever you are           wonderful tonight.

      I will have to write a short one today, simply because I've just woken up and I have school! man I need to be at the station in like, 1 1/2 hour. Righhhtt so I was at my project last night, doing the personal website and boy did it get irritating when I couldn't get it right. I got it like, finally, but I was dead beat that the moment I had my whole body on my bed, everything switched off.   Yesterday was alright, learned a bit and well...got lost when Mr Siah talked about Logic Gates and formulas. He did the sums so quick, I couldn't follow :/ After school me, Amy and Chew Yee went to Causeway Point to get our comics, and surprisingly we went to the library, hah. Chew yee surprised me actually, I didn't know she actually read quite a number of english story books. Sandra brown! haha, all loves stories :/   Then I went over to Pasir Ris to meet  her . Being able to see her, is really important to me. And somehow it lifted my spirits.  I don't mind waiting for you and sending you home is easily the sweetest thing I can do.  Being able to laugh and smile with you, is such a special thing.  I visited Amy's and Xing's blog. Xing, its good you have your blog back up, don't give up on your english. And yeah, I wasn't too happy seeing Xing slack in school, and what's worse is that Kuan KO is almost picking on him. But use it positively and Xing, it'll help you.   Amy (: I just really hope you'll be feeling better yourself too. We're all mentally tired actually if you noticed, but don't ever give up on your faith, the things and people you believe in.   Time for school! No time for quotes and lyrics! BLAH!  Peace.

       "From the bittersweetness love provides?    I will redefine my place within this union    For what is a lie?    And the better me can't show its side    I will try to find my way to higher ground"     &nbsp;   Satellite- Santana feat. Jorge Moreno     &nbsp;  I'm happy, I won't deny it now. I'm so happy when i'm with  you , you're like a new breath of air to me, refreshing and uplifting. I'm getting my confidence and faith back, slowly, bit by bit. We're both starting to believe in ourselves again, aren't we? -smiles-   Today was alright, plain and boring. I had the weekend to pick myself up, and now school's back on, ergh..somehow I felt so sluggish today. As usual, Kuan KO was right on time, well like 1 minute early. But that doesn't mean people who come in just 1 minute after are late right? bah, he actually scolded some people for being late when they came right at 1300. Is he trying to be cute or what? I'm really wondering, is Kuan KO stupid, or some act cute fella? Man can you believe he actually said, "I know a lot of girls wanna marry me, right?" Oh god. Irene told me about what she and Reiko had been imagining, Kuan KO in a white singlet, ragged and torn pants, holding what seems to be an "erhu" and playing away like it was a violin. Plus what I read from Irene's blog, "..., and biting his prata." Lol rene, you crack me up so much(cheoooonnggggg arhhh!!! -grins-). I guess Kuan KO leaves us with a bittersweet feeling, never fails to crack us up with that silly moustache and really ridiculous comments sometimes, yet he's so irritating.   Before I forget, my first lesson was "Thinking and Problem solving" The things we did today were seriously boriiiiing -bleh- And so much for C programming, I lasted like 1 hr and 20 mins of the 2 hrs before starting to slack away. At least I know I absorbed most of it today, unlike the times when I left the lecture room feeling empty inside, knowing absolutely nothing. I'll buck up (:   Basically, it was a Blue monday(monday blues) how cliched. I headed home right after school, time to finish up my math tutorials plus C programming!   Kesh, i'm so glad you're getting your writing back (: beautiful works.   I'm feeling better, stronger. I'm finding my faith again, i'm learning all the time. " Lose but don't lose the lesson ". I know  you  will be with me, right here by my side. I'm learning to let go, of my wallet, but its still something really important to me.    [I dare you// to love me.]     &nbsp;    In your arms, holds the happiness I seek.      In your heart, lies a love, a faith so important to me.      In your eyes, there's only&nbsp;me.        &nbsp;    Everything I am to you, you are to me.&nbsp;

       "And in a wide sea of eyes    I see one pair that I recognize"     &nbsp;   Ben Folds Five- The Luckiest     &nbsp;  Slowly, I'm picking myself back up, I'm picking up pieces of my life. I feel better guys, thanks for all the support, but most important...was your presence with me today,  you .   I rushed off to Raffles Place this morning for the outing with my Photography Club members. I have to admit this, I felt so intimidated by those present when they seemed to know almost everything about photography, about the equipment and basically, almost everything. And me? I felt like I didn't know anything at all, man I remember how terrible it feels to be low on confidence. But a little confidence goes a long way, I'm gonna keep going (: I believe I took some good shots after I took some time to settle in, but well...I believe i'll know how to take better shots soon (:   I didn't have breakfast at all in the morning, but the good news was that I was meeting my baby at City Hall at noon! -grins-   It feels so good to have my arms around your waist, fingers intertwined, and feeling happy again. I smiled, for once I smiled for real. Both &nbsp; You & I &nbsp;had a great day -smiles-   My parents went for the movie "Brotherhood" heh, i'm so glad they found time to relax on their own.   I got into a little squabble with my 2nd sis, but well I won't talk much about it, things are getting better, that's good enough.   About my wallet, even though it means so much to me, if I really do not get it back, i'll learn to let it go.   Baby, I'm not giving up on our dreams, I wish you knew how much your laughter and smiles meant to me.   HAPPINESS -winks-&nbsp;    "A love letter waiting to be written,    a story of love waiting to be told.    A touch of a hand waiting to be felt,    a tear on the cheek waiting to be wiped.    The heart of a soul waiting to be entered,    the key to that soul waiting to be used."     &nbsp;   -The Key     &nbsp;    You were with me today, man nothing could feel better        &nbsp;    &amp;I love you

       "Cause now again I've found myself    So far down, away from the sun    That shines into the darkest place    I'm so far down, away from the sun    That shines the life away from me    To find my way back into the arms    That care about the ones like me    I'm so far down, away from the sun again"  &nbsp;    Away from the sun- 3 Doors Down    I'm back blogging (: reached home really late last nite after   'phat nite'   so I was really tired, and i've just taken a pretty long nap today.   Another week has passed, time really flies, doesn't it? It has been a traumatising week for me, and certain things that have gone through my head, just leave me torn inside. Bad things come in threes, really. It felt as if it was never-ending. I lost my wallet yesterday, I was so depressed. Me, Xing, Imm, Amy and Mei ling left school for Causeway point to have our lunch, since we had a 3 hour break, but who'd realise that when I reached our destination, I didn't have my wallet in my pocket. Only someone...would probably know how much significance my wallet had to me. It wasn't just a wallet. I made a police report, made a call to the Taxi Headquarters, i'm still clinging on to some hope, that I would get it back...sigh. Why did something like that have to happen when everything was just going wrong for me? Well, I guess things just happen. I don't wanna let my parents know about it yet, because I feel ashamed, of losing my things. I've always misplaced my things, lost my ez-link cards, I feel so...sick.     'Phat nite'   was alright, there was fun and laughter, but when it all ended, the same sinking feeling came right back. I'm gonna face up to my problems though, I don't wanna feel so dead, anymore. That was all yesterday.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Today was alright, went for photography in the morning. Its really interesting and I do believe i'll learn a lot, the guy guiding us cracked me up for being so animated and straight-forward about his views. That's all I had today, I just needed rest when i got back home because i've been really drained the past couple of days. I'm hoping things get better.&nbsp;     We could hold hands, walk down this path we've chosen and be happy, tell me, is it true?

      I'll make things really brief today, because i'm really tired.   I reached home around six forty-five yesterday, it wasn't that bad but well, I wasn't exactly happy. School was alright like its been for a few days, i'm understanding some topics so I guess that's progress but i'm still gonna need to cover some revision on my own. Me, Xing and Amy felt really bored after school and didn't really wanna go home, so in the end we accompanied Mei Ling to town (: she was going for work! heh. We decided to walk around, and kinda did some shopping, well strangely enough it was 2 guys and a girl. laughs. I didn't buy anything tho, found the Joey Yung CDs I wanted! but, i'd be broke if I got all of them, sigh.   I'm not happy. Even though I shed a few smiles, I just wasn't happy. Things aren't getting better, i'm hurting people I love. I feel so tied down by problems everyday, what's different now is that I no longer know what I'm supposed to do, or can do to solve things. I haven't spoken to my 2nd sister for quite some time, and when i do she only replies with a few words, that's not a conversation. Owells.   I'm having my Photography workshop this Sat (: 10-1230, finally. I feel excited, for some reason.   I don't know if  you  are reading, you probably would a few days after i write this, maybe. I don't know if this is a self-confession of sorts, but I care for  you  and it just isn't the same being without you. I do have a good bunch of friends I can hang out with, i'm thankful, yet I feel i'm not truly happy sometimes. I wish you'd know I care so much for you, that i'm worrying every night about you, that I...would just wait quietly, for a simple message from you, that you care for me too. Nights like that feel terribly lonely, maybe i'm here without you.     [Iloveyou]       I'm losing my footing tonight, falling,&nbsp;will you reach your hand out to me? will you?

        [you were the one, who spoke of secrets I heard only in my dreams]       &nbsp; Tonight, feels a little lonely.   School was alright today, although we were 'late' again. I met Xing, Jon and Chew Yee at the station around 1145, which was the time all of us were supposed to meet. Amy who felt slight feverish last nite was late, but just that tad late :) so it was ok. But in the end, we all waited for Mei Ling and I guess, we were late again. haha. Right when we entered the tutorial room, Mr Khor started ranting about why we were late, about how unacceptable it is, but since its our first time in his class he didn't mark us absent -grins- I understood my C programming today&nbsp;-yay- and in Digital Electronics class, me and Jeremy managed our practical pretty well too. Ms&nbsp;Lian decided to call us JJ since&nbsp;our names started with 'J'&nbsp; hah -beams-  That was all we had in school and right after that me, Xing, Xian and Imm headed to the South canteen for some lunch. Everything was okay for today, i wasn't showing any of the..pain..that i had been feeling for the past couple of days. I don't know why, but I still smiled a little today, maybe I feel better. Amy, you sent me the song by Sabyia-The second you sleep, and yes its a wonderful song, and beautiful songs are always worth a sigh -sighs- i've been feeling a little drained, but i'm not that far away from the sun, my sunshine.   Me, Xing and Amy actually had a pretty good heart to heart talk last night, and I'm thankful, I found the two of ya (: sure felt good to churn out everything we used to feel about one another. Xing, you must be beaming with pride hearing Amy telling you that you were charming -grins- but you're a great guy, keep it up.   I've been occupying myself with comics, and 'Naruto' a series i've been interested since quite some time ago is a wonderful manga. I've even learnt quite a few things about life as well.   "when you want to protect someone so important to you, you'll become so much stronger, don't you have someone important in your life as well?"    &nbsp; I'm looking forward to   'Phat nite'   -winks-  I want to protect  you  even if its the pain I have to bear with.     Translate the mysteries of our dreams, let me bleed the words.

        I wish you would believe me.        &nbsp;  You close your eyes  and leave me naked by your side  You close the door so I can't see  The love you keep inside  The love you keep for me   It fills me up  It feels like living in a dream  It fills me up so  I can't see  The love you keep inside  The love you keep for me   I stay to watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  It gives me time to stayto watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  I wish by God you'd stay   I stay awake  I stay awake and watch you breathe  I stay awake and watch you flyaway into the night  Escaping through a dream   I stay to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  It gives me time to stay to watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight  &nbsp;  Tomorrow you'll be gone  I wish by God you'd stay  &nbsp;  - Sabyia: The second you sleep

       "To see you when I wake up    Is a gift I didn't think could be real    To know that you feel the same as I do    Is a three-fold, Utopian dream.    You do something to me that I can't explain.    So would I be out of line if I said,"I miss you"?"     &nbsp;   -Incubus: I miss you   &nbsp;  I'm tired. School has been tough and I'm trying, really trying hard to grasp the concepts for C programming. Earlier today, we had something on "Logic gates" *sigh* I got so frustrated because I could follow, but&nbsp;I was still unsure and I just found out mistakes all over. I'll keep my head up. Kuan KO is starting to get on my nerves, why does he not utilise a full 2 hours to teach us math, he does 1/2 hrs for a 1hr lecture, 1 hr for a 2 hr lecture.&nbsp; He marked us late for lecture too, even though it was only 3 mins after he started his lesson or rather made his entrance into the lecture room. Other classes are starting to piss me off, when Kuan KO asked why we were late the other classes were busy shouting "go work la! work at nite la!". That was because Reiko said that the first time she was late that she worked at nite. To hell with all those fools from other classes, if you want to play the dissing game you better buck up before you even test my patience. I'm not feeling very friendly tonight.  &nbsp;  I realised i spent a lot of time with Amy and Xing today, and it was good, ya'll mahhh 2 best buddies in school. Thanks (: Btw, me, Jon, Xing and Imm registered for the R 'n' B night on Fri, i'm looking forward to it. Just let me loosen up a lil ya? Me, Amy and Xing chilled at causeway point this afternoon, and took some pictures, good ones (: I'm feeling a little short on words tonight, getting lost in my train of thought.  &nbsp;  After that I met my baby at her school, I was so glad to see her. I wish I knew the words to tell you how badly i've missed you, and how to tell you how torn I'd feel when I see you walking away when all I wanna do is to grab at your hand, pull you close and share an embrace. That's when I miss you most, you're so near, yet you're that little distance away. Its so nice to know you've missed me too, but I know the both of us haven't had it easy, missing one another. Nothing's stronger than the faith I have in the both of us, I can make things happen, so can we, will you keep believing in me too?  &nbsp;  Amy said this, "those who have a lot to write in their blogs, sometimes are the most troubled people." I realised i've written a lot over the couple of days and I have my own problems, but I know I'm still contented with the lot i'm given. Writing, has always been my very own method of expressing the deepest emotions that I hide from almost everyone. I feel really weak now.  &nbsp;  PS to Sky: Bro, lonely portrait is inspired by a song. Sometimes, the most beautiful words turn out to be those of sorrow; the sweetest songs tell of sad memories, beautiful pictures portray heart-breaking departures and the best novels convey a   br o k en   love. I am inspired. Was I once lonely, yes, very. If only anyone out there, knew how it felt to have yourself erased from pictures that kept memories of the past alive, what if one day, no one remembered your existence. So vulnerable.&nbsp; &nbsp;    [take away our names, would you still remember me?]     "And I don't want the world to see me    Cuz I don't think that they'd understand    When everything's made to be broken    I just want you to know who I am"     &nbsp;   -Goo Goo Dolls: Iris &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The very picture of  you  lying on my shoulder, sleeping so well, happily yet because you were tired, hurts me.  I miss you.   &nbsp;    Then comes a day, I&nbsp;shall awake with you by my side. Our hearts make a pair, don't they?

       "And in case you were wondering,    you are like a sunset to me.    You're all kinds of beautiful as you end my day    and you sweetly retire as the stars chase you away."     &nbsp;   -The Spill Canvas: Sunsets and Car Crashes     &nbsp;  I'll be brief about today. I've just taken a bath, and definitely feeling fresher than I was an hour earlier. School's tough. I'm trying so hard, to understand C programming. Gambatte!  &nbsp;  I had thinking and problem solving lesson this morning, literally it set me thinking. Well, basically we were a little late for class since me, Jon and Irene plus Amy decided to wait for Mei Ling. As soon as we settled in class, Mr Ghazali was shooting off questions that we were supposed to answer 'Yes or No' to determine our thinking preference. I guess mine was a little accurate, even though I only believe its a method for us to get to know our own thinking preference and not decide whether you are someone who is creative or someone with no interpersonal skills. My results; I'm someone who uses my interpersonal skills quite a lot, and basically I am a very disorganised person since I don't have a very sequential thinking. After that comes my imagination which has the 2nd most hits, then analytical thinking.  &nbsp;  After that, we were given very open-ended questions that sounded like, "What if everything in the universe doubled in size overnight?", "What if dogs were intelligent and we were their pets?". Well those were the questions my group was supposed to answer which we did, rather simply yet still raised a discussion. I had a lot to say earlier today, voicing my opinions on the perceptions other groups had regarding their own questions and I liked it. All along I liked having discussions, being a rather opinionated person myself. We had lunch, and then a half-hour Kuan KO lesson plus a rather boring lecture on C programming, why is Mr Chai monotone? He talks in such a soft voice, expects everyone to understand the words he speak yet he doesn't realise we're new to this module and for a start, we don't even know what to ask about. So when he goes, "any questions? can we move on?" everyone is quiet. Then my eyes start closing, but I still keep them open anyhow. Its a tough module though.  &nbsp;  I was happy to see Amy in school today -grins- me and her have a lot to talk about, even though we didn't have much opportunities to talk about stuff today cuz we were in different classes. But still, while we were at the MRT station at Yio Chu Kang, we both got tickled so hard simply thinking about Xing when the three of us talked last nite. Basically, me and Amy spoke in a rather, English American slang which kinda confused Xing. It was all for fun Xing, but yup cut down on too much Singlish and English isn't that hard after all, even though I'm not that good myself.  &nbsp;  Amy, I'm glad you seem that little bit chirpier today, you have a fantastic smile and good luck for your Dance audition! I'm looking forward to the results, because I do believe you'll make it, but even if you don't(considering 200 girls applied for like 20 slots) you're still a helluva dancer, right? I'm sure you wanna make a fool outta me, seeing you said this "I can dance for you, provided you'll dance with me." Oh my god, Amy you don't know how bad a dancer I am. I'd be so embarrassed.  &nbsp;  I am thinking about Floorball and Photography, I do believe having 2 CCAs will take up too much of my time, because I still want my time to do other things. I have more interest in Photography, and basically it has grown to be a passion of mine and maybe one day, just maybe I'll be a good photographer. I'd like that very much.  &nbsp;  Xiaowei (: baby, your presence in my life is amazing. I know you've been busy with school, and you're tired by the time school ends. But its okay really, that you don't have time to reply my smses so often, we still have time at night remember? -smiles- Tuesdays and my weekends are what I look forward to with so much eagerness, simply because that's when I have time to be with you. Even if its simply sending you home, or spending time talking about our own lives and problems, or even cuddling for a hug or two, its lovely. I've known you for such a long time, I feel like i've known you forever. But that's a good thing, because over the time I've known you and been with you, i've grown so much and i cherish our times so much more. You said I've been your silly lil' boy, I know I'm not lil' anymore, but by god,  I'd love to be your silly boy always.   &nbsp;    If I had wings, you'd be the first I'd take to the skies.

        "Justin: Bruddderr. :) You irritate the hell outta me sometimes, but i love you, you know that right? Heh. Thanks for hearing me out when i needed to rant (very often, right? lol.) You give me chances to be who i really am, and you have a lot of patience when it comes to dealing with me. I know i can be unapproachable and mean sometimes, but thanks for giving me chances and being so nice to me. You say I've changed you and helped you, well you've done the same for me, bro, and i really need to thank you for that. I'm sorry i don't reply to your sms-es most of the time, and i can be a total ditz when it comes to music boxes (remember how i thought you meant those thingys which you store CDs in, haha) but i try my very best to be a good ol' sista for you 'cos you treat me so damn well. Anyways you deserve my first-class treatment! heh :) All the best to you and Xiao Wei. "       &nbsp;  --something Kesh wrote about me.  &nbsp;  I just had dinner *yay* I was so hungry and I had two rolls of Po Piah. I wonder if its just me, but i've been reading about certain things in the past; what happened with my friends in jan, last year, things people and friends have written for me on Friendster, and yup, that little piece written by Kesh. Some how, I feel indebted to her. Its nothing very big really, but in a way, she used to be the sister i never had(i was never that close to my sisters in the past), someone I really looked up to. I feel nostalgic (: I still have the poem, she wrote for me back when we were Sec 3, "an angel for you" *sigh and smile*  &nbsp;  I miss secondary school, well a little, I miss my friends. Kesh whom I haven't seen for ages even though we're not that close anymore, my little own bunch; Sakinah, Delfina, Nuha, Suffian(my brother) Ana my sis and Diyana. Or even people like Sky, Daniel, Kai sheng and Kang wei. 3F'03 and 4F'04, our official Lit class rocked ;) man, I even miss Mdm Effendi.  &nbsp;  I have done a little soul searching, and it isn't that I don't know what I want, but somehow...time just passes so quickly now, I feel lost.  &nbsp;  I met my darling early this morning for breakfast (: right before she left for project, and I saw her for a little while too yesterday before I sent her home. Sigh, i wish i had more time. But every moment spent, is a part of me that I will always cherish. I miss her, it doesn't feel good, when I see you having to walk away from me, that I can only look at you from afar. You looked so beautiful this morning, I just felt this lovely charm all around you floating through my soul :)  &nbsp;  Xiaowei, when you called me Justin yesterday, my heart skipped a beat. I know i once told you not to call me by my name, even before we got together, yet, the reason was because it made me feel really special to you, however strange it may seem. Sharing a little hug with you on the bus, was amazing. I'm so, so hoping that i'm gonna be with you soon. Do you even know how much I miss you baby?  &nbsp;  I had a talk with my eldest sis this afternoon, and I'm sad. Yet again, its because of my 2nd sis. How much more trouble does she want to cause? She's taking slimming pills, and she had about 16 panadol pills in her bag. Its a dilemma really, because me and my sis, don't know whether to inform our parents about this, yet...we don't want to cause them anymore worries. But if anything happens, which I pray not, we'll be responsible for not telling our parents when we had actually known. Sigh. I've never known my 2nd sis to be one who'd take pills, I just didn't believe it when my eldest sis told me.  &nbsp;  I feel pathetic. Even though my eldest sis studies psychology and writes into the papers frequently, and I myself, aspire to be a psychologist, we're unable to solve a problem in our family. I've heard it from so many directions, every family has their very own problems. I know we're not alone, but, its been years, when will it stop? When can i stop getting in-between, its hurting me. I pains my heart so much, when my parents are upset and worried, yet I've been such a disappointment to myself, and everyone else&nbsp;who believes in me.  &nbsp;  Time passes so quickly, i'm already 17, and i've received the letter to register for NS. I know i can ask for defererment as i'm still currently studying in Singapore, but 3 years will soon pass, and with another 2 in NS. I know certain things will change, but i'm hoping, really hoping, things do actually change for the better.  &nbsp;  Some how, it feels good talking about marriage, about future careers and our lives. I know i'm growing up, talking about 'adult matters', and discussing important topics like the happenings in Singapore or overseas.  &nbsp;  Xiaowei, in you, I believe i've found my life partner, my best friend, my confidante, soul mate and my wife. I know that you'll always be here for me, like i've always been for you, I wish I had the words to tell you how much you've actually given me.  &nbsp;  I'm dreaming;  of being able to cook for someone so lovely every moring, every night&nbsp;  of being the fillial son  of graduating with a&nbsp;Diploma and furthering&nbsp;my studies in University  of having a secure career with a wonderful family of 2 kids  of spending all the time I have possible with you in my arms.  &nbsp;    !&amp;__if only dreams would come true, I'd be so blessed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       "I could spend hours lying in your arms, watching the world go by, and not feel the slightest bit of sadness. That sounds strangely exaggerated, and yet, i know it isn't. Because when i'm with you, your ultimate wish is to chase all my unhappiness away, to keep me smiling and laughing. And i will do just that- your love keeps me in bliss.But the moment your hand stops touching mine, the second which either you, or i, turn away, i feel my heart crumbling again. I literally feel my dilemma creeping back in, haunting my thoughts and somehow, i just cannot smile again. It is not another who is making me sad, rather it is this torn feeling in me which i cannot seem to ignore. Try as i might, i cannot feel the same sense of freedom i have when you are around. When you are around i feel protected, i feel as though nothing can go wrong." &nbsp;   &nbsp;  -taken from kesh's earlier entry &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Listening to a song by joey, " lonely portrait " for the past week. Somehow, i've been enraptured in a series of thoughts, including several mixed emotions. &nbsp;  “记忆是照片 总不停拿出来翻阅 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; 我们的照片 温柔在左边 深情在右边 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 少了你 故事没能到终点” &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm settling in well in school, Cute Co. rocks however corny it sounds; we're a fantastic class. The whole of this week has zipped pass me&nbsp;so quickly. Monday; we had Thinking and&nbsp;problem solving class&nbsp;which we&nbsp;were given questions to answer, its proven that there are so many different ways to look and perceive at a situation. Tuesday; a black day for me other than meeting my lovely girlfriend after school. I spilled cola on my&nbsp;white shirt, got a cut on my finger out of nowhere, and&nbsp;the worst had to happen, stepping on chewing gum. Wednesday; I'm finally starting to grasp my modules and I had floorball practice. Thursday;&nbsp;late for school, in the end I only attended the 11&nbsp;am class since there was no point barging into the lecture room LATE with everyone staring at your totally drenched clothes. Friday; weekend is finally here (:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've met really fantastic people in my class, the best being amy (: I was surprised to know how philosophical she was even in the short conversations that we held, but its a good thing. In a way, she's the person i'm able to connect best in school, talking about our lives, studies, families or even cracking oh-so-lame jokes. Xing, with his multiple indentities including "xiao tian tian", "Si wen zai", "babooXING" and the original; "Ma SiXing". heh. He's someone else i'm thankful to know, because with him and Jonathan, we're the pioneers of Cute Co. ;D If our class didn't have Irene, it'd have prolly been boring since day one, therefore we're all glad to have her. I'm happy in school, yet there are times, when I cover my worries with smiles and laughter. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I miss you.  I remember the conversation we had last Saturday, on the train. Did you know how wonderful it felt to be there, simply putting my arms around your waist like I always do just because i don't want you to fall, or for anyone else to knock into you. We discussed about the Singapore education system, on how it has failed to cultivate and inculcate creativity yet claim its an efficient system. There's still a little part on me, that still holds on to the Literature culture in me even though I'm an IT student now. It was sad, to realise that people like Gwen, Houston or even KaiSheng and Kang Wei dropped literature because they took math and science in JC and there was no combination that included Literature. But someone I used to look up to, and still do, is still pursuing her dream however taxing its been on her. Kesh dear, we're not as close as we used to be, however I still pray that one day, you will make it where you always wanted to. Mass Comm is tough, but I believe in you. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Last night, I dreamt of you.  I was so close to you, yet I had to wake up. Together with me are memories of such wonderful times we've spent in union; walking in the rain at Chinese garden, when you celebrated my birthday for me at the Esplanade park that night, the way you flustered when you thought you had lost our ring, or simply, the image of you lying so peacefully, sleeping on my bed. &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Be married at 24, giving only Chinese names to our children, being fillial to our parents.   &nbsp;__we could be such, love birds  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;    I realised, i'm so in love with the girl I've been with since the 10th of March, year 2003.

      Good morning world! hah, yes, its one in the morning! 1 A.M. hah! Well I should be asleep but I thought, well it wouldn't do much harm to stay up a lil more and write out a lil bit tonight -grins-  I always seem to say the same thing on weekends, hah..well actually the weekend has passed and its back to Monday blues? Hmm thoughts of lectures with D math and C prog -grr- frustrating sometimes, but still I'm gonna keep trying trying trying ya! heh.  I don't want to give up, not ever.  Time has passed so quickly again, tests are coming pretty soon and I'll have to start preparing now cuz I still feel i'm quite behind my syllabus.  The best thing about Monday's is that I will be seeing xiaowei! hehe...sending her home, that's my privilege -smiles- I remember how it felt when the hols ended, or when you started school and I had to wait for mine. I picked you up from school almost everyday, it was a wonderful feeling actually, to be able to send your girlfriend home safe and sound. Even if all I had was about half-an-hour everyday, I felt happy, happy to learn to cherish even the shortest moments with you. Yet, sometimes the shortest moments with you are the most beautiful ones. You would rest your head on my shoulder and sometimes fall asleep so peacefully, and when the sun comes out i'll cover your eyes so that the glaring light doesn't get in your eyes. Then, there would be times we would spend the whole 30 mins we have on the bus sharing very cold jokes, the very dry type, spelled as L-A-M-E. Hah, we'd spend all the time laughing over how ridiculous the joke is and I would kiss you on your cheek all of a sudden. You look so beautiful when you're shy, maybe cuz that's when you don't hide anything, nothing at all, you're free -grins-   I love you  .  We spent the whole of Saturday together and you don't know how important it was to me to be able to see you, it was hard really, hard when you felt so negative the previous couple of days and I, I felt like I just couldn't cheer you up at all.  I really needed to see you smile.  Like all Saturdays, or the weekends we've spent together, nothing could be better than to have you right by my side, holding on to my arms, and sometimes sharing the sweetest embrace. Even times when we spend our days watching VCDs at home, or just lie on the bed and listen to the music on the radio, its never boring, I could never get tired of you, never. There's just something so special about you that sets you apart from any other girl, or even person i've ever met in my entire life.  I don't know how you make me feel that way, neither do I know why I feel that way, but I simply love it and cherish it.  You are special.  Weekends are best, and the reason is you.     I had steamboat earlier with my friends, it was Mei ling's birthday! hah, happy birthday to her. Amy, Mich, Xing, Lixuan, Jon and Mei ling were all there and we ate so much, hah but all that smoke made my shirt smell -bleh-  Time to sleep, the clock struck 12 an hour ago.    &amp;baby, did you know I live my life for you? You are everything to me.          Everything I cherish and never could afford to lose.

       "I ne'er was struck before that hour   With love so sudden and so sweet,   Her face it blossomed like a sweet flower   And stole my heart away complete."     Baby,   You are the answer to every prayer i've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I would be able to live without you. I love you, Xiaowei, more than you can ever imagine.     I always have, always will.          &amp;loving you feels more natural than my own heartbeat

       "When I see you now - moving slowly with new life growing inside you - I hope you know how much you mean to me, and how special this year has been. No man is more blessed than me, and I love you with all my heart."       -The Notebook         "Love, in these last and tender hours   is sensitive and very pure   Come morning light with soft-lit   powers   to awaken love that's ever sure."   -Walt Whitman     11th August 2004, today was actually alright, it felt a little strange though because I haven't had such a day for quite a period of time. I was late for everything and that simply took away my mood to even attend school. So, I didn't go to school.  Strangely, it has been a long time since I spent a day with no destination and alone. I wandered around, just like the wonders I had in my mind, it wasn't soul-searching but purely giving more thought about what I have gone through so recently and reminiscing about everything in the past. Maybe some times, nostalgia isn't the best thing. There are times I find myself back where I used to be in the past, too much nostalgia brings back the pain and hurt i've been through but I cherish every memory and every moment that I have lived through.  I felt myself, tracing back the steps we took, together the path we chose to walk. One step at a time,   I see you in all the familiar places  , memories can take me so far, but I wished you were there with me. I walked around at Junction8, thought about the things we talked about yesterday and how good it felt to see you, all I needed was one glimpse of you to lighten my emotions and lift me up. I remember taking my dinner while you accompanied me, and so cheekily took pictures of me eating -amused- I feel special, every time you're somewhere close to me.  I went back to Marina, I really wanted to. Sunday was a fantastic night, but it wouldn't have meant anything if I didn't have you with me. I watched  The Notebook  for the second time. I read the book recently, completing it where I last stopped, and this time while I watched the movie the words and pictures just seemed to fall in place like a puzzle. It was beautiful, really, and what was so good about it was that I was able to share it with you on Sunday. I sat in my seat, comfortable but a little chilly in the cinema. I just remembered then, how cold you felt that you kept sneezing and I put my arms around you to pull you closer, hoping you'd feel warmer. I could feel you, your hand holding on to mine, tightly as you placed your head on my shoulder. Or when we shared the Hotdog I bought and you, you sneaked in some fries we had gotten at Mac before we went to the cinema.   You  called me, today, while I was watching the movie alone. I was glad really, to know you cared, but i'm also sorry I made you worry. I could feel you with me, I really did. Some how, hearing your voice leaves me feeling so settled and safe wherever I am.  Xing, thank you. I know I made you worry as well but i'm alright, really. I just took the day off, to wander around alone and spend some time thinking. I do love being alone actually, moments like what I used to have. But I still need my friends, I still need the girl I love, I need my family.  It feels as though I have grown a couple years older after all the thinking, maybe i'm just a lil tired, haha.  I find my passion for poems, as well as writing being rekindled.   "Our souls were one, if you must know   and never shall they be apart;   With splendid dawn, your face aglow   I reach for you and find my heart."       &amp;you are the closest thing to an angel i've seen

       "I am nothing special; of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts, and i've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."       The Notebook   -Nicholas Sparks  I feel like I've fallen in love with  you , again. I used to sit by my window, look up to the stars and remember of the empty nights i've spent telling myself how much I've missed you; you were so near yet so far. I spent the past couple of days with you so close to me, I could always feel your hand wrapped around mine closely, you never left my side,  never . Knowing how fast time passes when we're together, cherishing the memories that are left everytime I send you back home, you leave me abound with happiness. And for a fleeting moment, a tiny wisp of time that hung in the air like fireflies in summer skies, I wondered if I'm in love with you again. There's just so much about you that I believe in, and in the morning when I think about everything, I think about  you .  Today wasn't much, school was alright for me but lesson was until 5. At least, I do believe I'm starting to grasp most of the concepts in C programming. That's all for school.  I met Diyana in the school canteen, we were both taking our meals and it definitely painted a smile on my face to see her again -smiles- I was reminded of a lot of things, secondary school, that was when I went through a  transition , the things I've weathered changed me. I do have good memories with Diyana with her; writing and passing around lil notes in class, phone chats about the Hiphop scene, our passion for stars and being good friends for our friends. I had a really great bunch of friends back then.  Sakinah & Del , the both of you were the Crazy Duo. remember? The both of you were always laughing and Del, you were the singing one -chuckles- Lit Camp is still etched deep inside of me, we spent the night together lying at the corridor listening to music on my Laptop, talking about so many things -sigh-  Suffian , bro, where are you now? I've missed you a lot. We never really got into the best start possible, but we still made it as friends and eventually brothers who really were there for one another didn't we? You were part of me, you often came to me asking me and confiding in me about your problems, relationships and studies. You looked great with your  Silat  moves and we used to talk about taking up  Muay Thai &amp; Capoeira  together and you took your guitar with you wherever you went, I wish you could have taught me how to play the guitar -grins- I miss  Ana,  my sis. How we used to talk about so much trash and everytime you called me I was always gonna crap you up with everything corny and nothing useful. I miss  Gwen , she's the one who always had a joke ready for me, I guess that was where I usually got my crap as well. I miss 4F'03, I miss the whole Lit class, I miss  Ms Oniatta , I miss talking about the society, learning from  Mr Ghazali  about conspiracy theories and practically criticising the Singapore Education system in Singapore during CME lessons. I miss hanging around with mah buncha boys during recess at the shelter with  Sky, Edwin, Suff, Daniel  and so many of my other brothers. I miss  Nuha and Halimah , doing Lit Presentation Project with  Jeck Chuang, Dawn, Sofia and Ziyu  trying out skits and rehearsing out acts. I loved playing basketball with  Shirui, Desmond  and guys or soccer with my classmates under the sun. Its only now that I actually recognise that, I have in fact had a very good time back then despite the ocassional setback.  I'm just being   nostalgic  .  There's so much really, when I look back at what I have gone through the past 17 years and realise how much of a person i've grown into and there's so much more to learn ahead of me. There's quite a bit of positive energy running inside and through me, hopefully, it rubs off my friends, those who haven't had it easy recently.    &amp;Baby, Happy Anniversary (: You really made my day, simply by putting your hands around me and telling me, i'm everything you are to me. Everything.           ILOVEYOU

       "I've found a reason to show   A side of me you didn't know   A reason for all that I do   And the reason is you"      -The Reason   by Hoobastank     Hello World! &Happy National Day! hah, yes Singapore turns 39 today -grins- It was such a "Red" day, since almost everyone was wearing the HangTen T-shirt that sponsored the National Day Parade, however, mine was hanging in my closet back home. I wore Pink -rolls eyes- White+Red=Pink? National Flag Colours lar! -laughs-  I'm happy tonight -smiles- I met  you  at the Bugis MRT station and we decided to head to Marina Square to catch a movie after I checked with my sister and the cinemas at Plaza Singapura were almost fully booked. I guess it turned out to be a really good decision to head to Marina Square since the cinemas there were almost empty, haha, I mean not as many people go to Marina to watch movies. So we got our tickets! For the first time in awhile, we actually got tickets that wasn't designated for the first 5 rows -laughs- We caught the Movie " The Notebook " and it is by far, one of the best movies i've seen; its a wonderful story and to have the person you love right by your side, that makes it so much better. We took a little walk around after the movie and took our dinner and just when we wanted to check out the carnival on the opposite street we actually caught sight of the National Day Parade  Fireworks  -smiles-  Catching sight of the fireworks was totally unexpected and that's what makes it so much more special, do we call that fate? Maybe it was meant to be, but catching such a wonderful sight, with the girl I love and care for so deeply, is wonderful. We share so many beautiful memories together.  There's something so simple, yet its something so special about being with  you . I am the happiest person I can ever be when you are there with me, I feel free and so at ease. I shouted out, " I love Xiaowei! " I did and i'm amazed, where did I get the courage to do that? But when I did it, I didn't even have to think for a second and I was already shouting my mouth off, Hah. There is just something so crazy about you, because you make me do such crazy yet wonderful things. I am madly in love with you.  Blessed.   I don't have much to say tonight, except that  I am happy &I love you, baby.      [It's not always rainbows and butterflies]    "I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved"      -She will be loved   by Maroon5       &amp;I see forever when I look into your eyes

       "I love you yes i do   I'll be with you as long as you want me too   Until the end of time    From the day I met you    I know we'll be together   And now I know    I wanna be with you forever   I wanna marry you and i wanna have your kids   Thinking never compare to feel enough to kisses   I can say i'm truly happy to the same   You've made me think I'll die and live my life hesitate   There's never been no doubt in my mind    That i'll regret ever having you by my side    But if the day come that i'll have to let you go   I think that something I should probably let you know   With everything that i spent with you    Then i will miss you cuz i'm happy that i have you at all"      -Never Be Replaced   by 1st Lady   Good night everyone! hah, does that sound like a hello or bye bye? I wonder -ponders-  Well the weekend is almost over, like it always is...but it has been a rather good weekend for me (: happiness, yes, that's what I've had the past 2 days. I spent almost the whole day with  you  yesterday, i'm sure you know how much that means to me don't you? It hasn't been easy, it really isn't easy for the both of us, but we'll stand strong with my fingers interlocked with yours, no matter how cliched it sounds thats what we're gonna do -smiles- I want to face absolutely everything with you,   I don't wanna miss a thing  . We had a little session of tennis, i'm sorry for breaking out into laughter whenever you miss the ball, but you looked really cute then (: Then you snuggled close into my embrace while we watched "Love Actually", I guess, love is really all around and thats if only if we dare to open our eyes and look around for the people who make us happy. I miss  you  already, silly girl.  I caught the  Fireworks  earlier at the Waterfront, boy was it crowded but afterall, the fireworks was a pretty fine sight. I got some pictures but they were all badly taken, but beautiful things are more often kept hidden inside of us; memories. I met Xing, he was with momo his Indian friend who looked really cool, and three other girls including Rachel who was his Secondary school friend. Honestly, knowing both Xing and Amy, I've known so many other people. Riq, boy was it good to see you, but don't think yourself as a loner, I used to think of that and I did get used to being lonely, but things will change for the better, I hope.  Xing, thank you really, for being the bestest buddy in school for me, if it wasn't for you I do believe I would feel so out of place. Amy, you are one hella girl, my best buddy too (: but try to control your hormones, I believe you're turning into a guy if you hang out to much with the homies. Out of JAX, Xing, you have been the one who isn't ready to open up to us yet. Honestly, its something I would hope to change, both Amy and I saw how you left in a huff last Friday and yes it affected us more than I expected it to, I don't wanna see you give up, buck up brother. You know both Amy and I will be here for you. Amy, I know you're tired and how you've given up on certain things, but now just look at what is worth caring for and cherish it. Forget the unhappiness, its time for those things to stop. We all want to see you smile, you know that don't ya? -winks- Justin/Amylia/Xing BUDDIES ALWAYS :D -grins- This is a tribute.  Sky called me in the afternoon and told me he was depressed, its quite sad really, for me to realise the people I care about are bogged down by problems and more problems. One thing that really pushed me to think was what he said, "Bro, sometimes I really envy you, you always seem so happy." I did think about it, yes it is true, I am happy! I am so happy to announce to the world I am happy with being myself and having the people who make me happy stay around me. &amp;yes, I have realised that I want to stay around people who make me happy, whom I know I am able to make them happy as well, that I am someone in their lives, someone they appreciate. These are the people that recognise my existence, they are the people who keep me going. However, to Sky, I'm not someone who is always happy. I just make it a point to look on the brighter side of things, to think how to make the best out of things and not dwell on how I should have done this or should not have done that. There are times we will hurry back into our shells, just so people won't realise how insecure and vulnerable we actually are at that point of time, this is prolly the mask I used to talk about. Its human instinct really, as you grow older and experience the way people will react to things that happen. At the end of it, Yes, I am a happy 17-year-old right now.  I am contented with the lot I'm given. Yay! I talked to Gwen earlier on, boy do I miss her silly jokes -laughs-  You said,  "Silly. You are so silly. You make me love you so much."  But do you realise, that is exactly how I feel about you too -smiles- You make me love you, like its never to late to love a person with all his heart.    Our Ring.

       "And I don't wanna fall to pieces   I just want to sit and stare at you   I don't want to talk about it   And I don't want a conversation   I just want to cry in front of you   I   don't want to talk about it   Cuz I'm in Love With you      You're the only one,   I'd be with till the end   When I come undone   You bring me back again   Back under the stars   Back into your arms"   -Fall to Pieces by Avril Lavigne    I'm feeling a little down tonight, wonder if its the mood swing or something like that but anyway, the weekend is here again. Things went at an extremely slow pace today, but when I think of how quick another week has passed me by, its just...well I wanna slow down. I had bad mornings this week, plain afternoons and everything's like a blur -wooosh- and here I am again, waiting for the weekend and then the new week. There's just something I look forward to every time the weekend comes though, and that is the chance to be with  you.  -smiles-  Listening to songs always remind me of memories, good and bad. Maybe tonight, I'll think of my own memories. Like how it   all happened,  happiness.   I am still reminded of the time I was left all alone, so alone, by a bunch of friends whom I trusted so much in. I don't know why it happened, things just happen right? like -poof- and you're in this situation and already asking why why why? I don't want to go into details, but that was prolly the lowest point of my life. I didn't want to trust anyone else, I believed closing the door to everyone else was the way, because then no one knows anything about you and they cant  hurt  you, can they anymore? Wouldn't it be worth it if I could turn cold and turn my back on everything and everyone else if that meant I wouldn't feel hurt anymore? Boy, was I selfish back then. I hated feeling vulnerable, I don't like the way some people can look at me like I'm transparent, I didn't want to feel hurt again, but as long as we have a heart, we'll feel the pain, won't we?  Then I found  you , when everyone didn't look at me, you did. Looking back now, everything happened so fast, its been a year and five months since we got together and almost three years since the day I got to know you. You have given me wonderful memories, like the first day we met; you told me I looked nerdy but good then insisted it was Shar who said I looked nerdy and how I felt something warm but gently growing into something more than pure attraction when I looked at you. On the first day we met, we only spoke about three sentences to one another(how shyyyy) yet wasn't it amazing that I felt that I could almost tell you everything about my life the first time I asked you out? And how you caught sight of the silly picture I drew at the back of the photo of me and my dad or how you realised I drank soyabean too. I promised to give you a flower, and I got you a rose on the second time we went out together even though you weren't serious about asking me to get you a flower, but I did and its special to be the first (: Spending my first Valentine's day with you, was kinda awkward but sweet nonetheless because I surprised you by going all the way to Khatib and in the end, we talked for over 2 hours and you told me the very next day you wondered what we talked about that lasted 2 hours. If it wasn't for you, I would never know I could actually do the things i've done for you.   10th of March   2003  , that night was really amusing but meaningful. What was meant as an innocent question, turned into something that brought our hearts together (:  We have gone from confiding in one another about our lives, writing emails and letters about the people around us and our problems to sharing each other's happiness like everytime your basketball team won, I was always rooting for you. We could talk about almost everything under the sun, sharing lil late night chats under the stars, I'd be lying under the cover of my blanket on my bed, waiting for your sms and then we'd continue to talk into the wee hours of the night even though it was a school night -grins- I told you about my passion for stars and literature, I told you about my dreams, about everything I wished to be. It was amazing, how I could take all myself, how  free  I felt just being around you. From talking about music bands, we talked about our exams and how we'd always encourage one another not to give up and jia you for the next paper. And after all that, we actually thought about  our future , a future together.  Do you remember the time I placed your palm on my chest, and asked you, "do you feel it? That is my heart, and it beats for you." I took your hand and pulled you closer, "you have such beautiful eyes, I would take eternity to gaze into your eyes, if i could." -sigh- how time flies.  Wasn't I the one who told you I wanted a hug from you every night? I was there with you, when I told you I would find your faith one day, and return it to you, didn't I?  "promises are meant to be broken."-me "no! promises are not meant to be broken!"-you "whether promises are meant to be broken or not, ours is forever -smiles-"-us  The very first time you teared in my presence, I couldn't stop crying.  Those were the very first memories.  "lets just say that there's sth called moving on. just tt now it's getting to me and i wanna slow down. and i'm so scared of changing. and catching up. i fear that along the way i might just fall down and lose sth impt to me again. and i'm so scared of growing up." [-taken from del's blog]  This is just something I've been thinking of tonight.    &I remember, the first time I told you, "Iloveyou", didn't I look silly?       &everytime you ask me why my heart is beating so fast, I tell you, "Its because of you".      Everything silly&amp;beautiful, &this is what I call bliss.     The first time we kissed; like cherry-blossom petals, you blushed     Oh how you fell into my arms, into the depths of my soul, into my life a love I'll always cherish

      Its night time! (: heh, I'm blogging while reading a magazine on my table and listening to Jay's new album (: whoaaaa I like it, gooooooood.  I think i'm gonna make it short tonight, don't really want to think too much about certain things. Anyway, to "()bserver" its really nice to know someone else's point of view over the issues i've written about. Honestly, I do believe certain aspects of what I wrote were a little biased, but everyone's entitled to their own opinions. There will always be, two sides to a coin.  "Why is it that us humans are the only creatures to this day forth capable of intelligent thought, why is there the supernatural void and many more. Think about it and I'll appreciate your views on this issue."  I'll think about it (:  I don't think I'm devoted to religion, or am I a very religious person. I don't know, I just know that as long as I have someone who is important to me, or something which means a lot to me, I will give all myself to make sure I don't take things for granted.  Rightt, so today was nothing special really, had school from 12-3pm. I was late for C programming, I rushed for it I really did, who'd expect Mr Khor actually overslept when he took a rest in his office, and only came in 20 minutes late -grins- Digital electronics was okay, and I mean OKAY. I've got to brush up on memorizing the type of Logic gates and Logic Equation plus familiarise myself with practical. I'm glad jeremy's my lab partner cuz i don't feel lost around him -winks- Cherios to my Partner and all my friends (: I headed home right after that and its been plain.  I don't have the words with me tonight.    &we wrote our names across the sky tonight     "Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies.

       "Somewhere over the rainbow   Bluebirds fly   Birds fly over the rainbow   Why then, oh why can't I?   Some day I'll wish upon a star   And wake up where the clouds are far behind me   Where troubles melt like lemondrops   Away above the chimney tops   That's where you'll find me "      -Somewhere Over the Rainbow   Its been a month already, since school started. Boy, does time pass quickly or what? I feel like I've aged, gee. Its just "growing up" I guess -ponders- I haven't blogged for like, the whole weekend, basically because I've been thinking quite a lot. Mmm its like, I'm usually crammed up with all sorts of different thoughts and opinions and I just didn't feel like writing them out. But i'm finally back here anyway.  Well since it happened last week, I realised how we so often wore masks even if we were in front of our friends. Of course I realised this much earlier already, but all of a sudden I just felt it was something really scary, kind of? I know its just a defence mechanism that we so often use; when triggered by something that causes us to fall so hard. So why is it that while we are crashing inside, we're smiling on the outside? Is that being hypocritical? I don't know. Even around our friends, we try not to show how much its hurting inside, how vulnerable we actually feel, don't we just go around smiling and laughing to the jokes pretending nothing actually happened? Yet, just when a moment sweeps pass, just one moment when you're alone, everything hits you again. You are reminded of everything unhappy, how much its hurting and when you look around and find people smiling happily, should you feel happy? or rather feel even worse because you can't be that happy? Friends share good & bad, happiness and sadness, so what are we supposed to do?  Its ironic really, how people desire having someone, or maybe friends to understand how you feel whether its being happy, or sad, yet how is anyone supposed to know better what is going on when one doesn't dare to open up to other people? Is this how we always contradict ourselves? I know how it used to feel; being vulnerable and weak and you just wish someone would be there for you, yet the thought of telling someone else your thoughts just seems worse because then, you'll reveal a really weak side of you, won't you feel even more vulnerable then? I guess, that was why I used to keep everything inside of me, I was afraid.  Everyone has their first times, I guess I did too. My friends, my family, past experiences and most importantly, having you with me (: these are reasons why I'm happy.  I talked to Xing and Amy about religion, does taking part in sunday masses and church meetings make you a "truly devoted" person? How do you measure devotion? I don't know, but I don't believe its something you can measure just by the number of times you attend Sunday masses, go to the church on Saturdays or talk loudly about "God" in front of your peers or even strangers.  I am a Christian, I have been baptised. However, what is taking me away from my religion is my increased awareness of the people that turn me off; "Mormons who come up to you in the MRT train and talk about attending church with them the coming weekend", "or people who proclaim loudly they are a child of god, how they claim to be extremely devoted to their religion because they attend church and have God at the tip of their lips". Even though these are people that are putting me off Christ, but there were people, who inspired me to believe in the religion itself.  Sam Goh-- Even though I don't have his contact anymore, I can remember how he used to guide me with the bible, how he allowed me to confide in him when I had problems and how we used to go to mass gatherings and feel inspired after singing Hillsongs and a talk by our pastor.   "those were the days ." -smiles-  Religion, as I believe now, exists simply because we humans are too weak. We need something we can believe in, when there is nothing else we have faith in. Its almost like turning to the nothingness and pushing yourself to believe there is "something" in nothing. Maybe this is what we call  faith . Nothing is stronger than my faith in myself, in the people I love and cherish, and my very own thinkings. Sadly though, it is also religion that divides the people, think Islam and hypocritical terrorists whom in the name of "Islam" carry out acts of treason and terrorism. Even Christ and the Jews. "God" is a common name we believe in, maybe one day faith will bring us all together.  My father used to take my family to the Church at Novena, however, my mum's side of the family are buddhist, so in the end we are Freethinkers (: I guess that is why, I have both Christ and Buddhism inside of me.  I've been reading my manga lately, well almost everyday -grins- Naruto is a wonderful manga, not only the drawings but especially to me, the whole story and philosophy behind it. I don't know how to express it, really, but i'm gonna try. I've learnt quite a lot simply from reading my manga.  "Its told of how, some of us used to be really lonely, but that changes when someone finally recognizes your existence, when someones appreciates the things you do however trivial they seem."  "When growing up, we will find one day, that there will be someone you cherish more than others, maybe even yourself, and because of this "love" you want to protect this person, even if it might endanger your own existence, but we become stronger because of this desire to protect what you cherish."  "The desire to protect what you cherish, that is what I recognize as "true strength". "  We often lose things before we recognize its value and learn not to take things for granted and start to cherish them. I have lost certain things I really felt was important to me, but what is most important now is cherishing what I have, and who I have with me now -sighs & smiles-  Kesh once told me, that I was different from her, I have an "untainted mind". But now, I feel otherwise, I've seen the different sides of people, I have seen how things can change and when things happen, nothing can stop it. I have grown more cynical, I have to admit that. I don't like to lose in a discussion, debate or argument. But more importantly, I believe I am myself, different from everyone else, because I have my own opinions and thoughts.  I'm not sure what this entry/writing is about, but this is where I rant and where my train of thought, doesn't end.   I miss  xiaowei  -smiles-     &you know, being silly lovers just means you're in love.        ILOVEYOU     "And when the night wind Starts to sing a lonesome lullaby It helps to think we're sleeping Underneath the same big sky"      -Somewhere Out There
