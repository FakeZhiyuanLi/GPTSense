      Sorry, but I gotta..I couldn't remember the words and it was driving me insane...  Artist : Lisa Loeb  Song : I Do   When I'm done with thinking, then I'm done with you When I'm done with crying, then I'm done with you When I feel so tired, then I'm done with you Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way.  And I do. You can't hear it, but I do. You can't hear it, but I do.  You're trying to convince me, that what I've done's not right I get so frustrated, I stay up every night. You ask me for an answer, and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air (I'm up in the air) Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way  And I do. You can't hear it but I do You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say  I will be ignored I will be denied I could be erased I could be brushed aside I will get scared, and I will get shoved down but I feel like I do because you push me around.  I'm starting to ignore you, I doubted you so long, I'm tired of over-thinkin, I know you don't belong Now I'm asking questions, No one pushes me around, Everybody feels this ways sometimes, Everybody feels this way  And I do You can't hear it but I do You don't seem angry but I do I do.

      HoLa. ¿Como estas? Ay yi yi. Babysitting: made $18. Woo. Kinda. I need to get $20 more for this sweater @ AE I want. I also want a kahki jacket lined with that sheep's wool stuff. There's one @ AF. Yah know what's stupid? As soon as I'm off groundation, Lloyd is on. Y LLOYD Y?! Ah. Pinche Madres. What else to say...  I like kiwis.   Do you ever find yourself thinking about someone? I do. I'll be thinking about someone then I'll feel stalker-like and stop. It's scary sometimes. Not a guy or someting, just like a friend you don't talk to anymore. Like..I sometimes am like:Man, haven't talked to Sophia in awhile..  I have Lisa Loeb stuck in my head, and the scary part is..I DON'T LISTEN TO HER! weird..  I'm out for now.

      Hey evry1. I'm in first period. WoO. Yah.  Thanks David..for saliva..  LoLiDoLiDoO.   Gosh, I am so bored. SAve me. Damn, and third period I have PE. Do you think I'm crazy b/c I bring another shirt to change into after PE? My first one gets all stretched out with all the taking on and off. YaH. So.  It was so sad b/c Clinton made it so people that needed welfare could get it regardless of conditions. That law or whatever it is he made, runs out this year two days after xmas. That means that all the people that are on welfare are going to be pennyless. California has it the worst. It is said it is going to be the worst welfare cut in California. Gray Davis is trying to delay the cut just enough so everyone on it can be fine. There's said to be a estimate of 300,000 people on welfare. May god have pity on their souls.   Eat your heart out.

      I don't like people that are always talkingabout how many people like them b/c they want you to think they're hard to get and just talking to you is amazing and you should appreciate it. Whoa. News. Who gives a shit? Not me. Get a life.  Itz amazing b/c...well it is. And I like..yah. And I think he knows. Cuz he asked. And I said no. And I'm writing in fragments. Cuz itz cool. SUE ME!  LaLaLA.La. Tomorrow is gEeTaR(guitar). YeEhAW!   Man, I love staying home alone but my family won't leave me alone anymore. They don't trust me. After I threw that mad rave..nothing has been the same.  Something Corporate is soft..mellow..kinda trying to be hard...I dunno..AH.  I'm so confused. I was called "crazy" like 298362378637 times today. Just 'cuz in PE I would stare off n2 space then laugh. It's b/c I think of something funny. Nothin wrong with that, foo!  Godsh..running...away..toodles...   If you would be my punk rock princess I would be your garage band king... -Something Corporate

      HeLLo. Still in first period. Such fun times. We have to do research on a certain vitamin. Mine's on vitamin E for obvious reasons. Jessica Lloyd is sitting here next to me. Laura Ramos is "absent". :-P PoOP! I feel really sick right now. My eyes are all watery and I look high. My nose is all sniffly. I've been sneezing and coughing. It's a wonderful life. I need vitamins...  Yah know what's really cool? Old music. Alternative, some pop. Stuff from the mid-to-early nineties and before. Like..Blind Melon, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins..all those old favorites.   Ahh "Cat" is very annoying. I think he thinks I like him just because of one time I took advantage of a situatioN(no not what you're thinking, sicko). So..I hope not. Let me clear this up. If you're reading this...I don't like you. HAHAHAHA.   Uhoh. I have nothing really to say and the teacher said we need to finish these by the end of the period. So LAtEr 4 NoW..... x0x0x0x0

After school was sooooo funny. I went up to this kid to ask when their practice was @.  He said:  Uh..I'm not oging to practice today..but it's normally right now.   I said:  ohh. thanks.   THEN AS I WAS WALKING AWAY, he said:  Ooh, I'ts cuz you want to see "DOG", HUH?!   Me:  nooo! It's cuz I want to see..uh..er..people. GeEz. Go away!  Hahahaha. Itz true though..what can I say?

       According to my Lucky Charms watch given to me by my brother, it has only been a few hours since I was last online. What can I say? I'm an addict...I guess. So I suppose people are out having fun. Guess what I did? I CLEANED MY ROOM! wOoHoO. Mi madre thought it was too cluttered so she made me clean it. I must say, it looks much better. Normally I pile my stuff on my bed. That is the most common place. I have a big bed and I only use half of it, so on the other half there are always binders of homework, the next day's outfit, etc.  Some of you are thinking: WHAT?! UR ROOM IS NEVER MESSY WHEN I COME OVER!..WeLL duh. I clean it. Oh it is so sad: When the cleaning lady comes, she completely ignores my room b/c it is messy. Hehe. Not anymore. Anyway.. Why do I talk about the most boring of things (messy rooms)? No clue. Does anyone know? Probably not.   Some people have been asking me about "doG". Well, don't worry about it.    CDs wanted:  U2: U2's greatest hits Queen: Queens Greatest Hits Nirvana: Nevermind, Insecticide The Donnas: The Donnas Spend the Night Kacey Chambers: single-Not Pretty Enough The Vines latest SLayter Kinney's latest Maybe: chevelle and the used...humm maybe! Also I want to check out The Ataris.. -I heard from Wick that The Vines latest CD is bad...Oh, I also want to go to the NOT SO SILENT NIGHT CONCERT @ the HP Pavilion in S.F. (tHE Cit-AY).  -*If you would like to contribute to my CD collection by buying these as a present..feel free. I would  love  you.....*-   When the lights go down in the city(OoOhOh)And the sun shines on the bay. Do I wanna be there in my city?(OoOoHOh) Whoaaa. whoaaa. whoaaaaaaooo. -Journey   What else to say? November is a great month. Mi madre's birthday is Nov. 30. November issue of the school paper is coming out soon. I have three articles in this month's. I think. I wrote three anyway. I like high school a lot better than other things. Except my math teacher. I really think she needs to get some new teaching methods. She gets her point across, but she is very droning.  She sits at the front of the classroom, writing on the whiteboard, showing us how to solve all the problems on the night-before homework. We have block scheduling so every class except on Mondays are two hours long. :-P So she has time to do that.   It seems like this day is dragging on and on.   I was just surfing the net when I came upon this website of a person. The person has some really good quotes on their webpage and express good political and social views.  IT was amazing, and made me think. I shouldn't waste this space with mindless chatter. It should be interesting. My friends are starting to call me a hippie b/c I'm against the war. Not "hippie" in a bad, put-down sort of way. If they were my opinions of Bush would still remain.  I went to this antiwar rally in the city. It really opened my eyes. There were nude people protesting, pot everywhere and hairy/stinky people all around. ((kinda sounds like a concert..)) Some people dedicate their lives to such important matters. Unimportant matters still surround me everyday though. I go to high school and what other people think about whom and what is the best way to do this/that/etc is the topic of most any conversation. I get tired of it. People need to look past their pathetic little home lives and to the world. I don't think a lot of kids my age get that if we don't do anything to help what's right, we're going to reel in the benefits of an unhappy place. This is our future. We need to act upon it. Stop worrying about what you look like, and who you think is talking about you. Others are a lot off worse than you. And in the end, it really doesn't matter what happened in high school. High school is just the beginning of a long life. High school is the shooting point of which you make ur decisions of what you want to do in life. It should not be the highlight of your life, it should be a time just like any other where you cherish the memories but not to the point where those are all your memories. After high school you have college. Or maybe you don't. Life without college will be pretty hard to come by, but that is a choice that all people make. I'm not going to lecture you on going to college, that is your own choice. As for me, I want to be educated. It's just like when I first started playing the guitar and Peter was teaching me up strokes. Not all music says that you need to stroke up so I was to understand eventually with enough playing, you(the player) will be able to just know by sound and experience whether to stroke up or down. And he's right. It's very simple to listen to music now and figure whether it's an up or down stroke. I want it to be that way in life. I want it to be that way for me. If you want it you can have it too.    Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.. -Smashing Pumpkins

      HeLLo. Whoa. This is my first time doing this. Let's see how it goes. I probably won't be able to post something everyday, so just wait it out. I know it will be hard waiting for my next posting of my "oh so exciting" life. What's going on now?-->Nothing really. It's almost noon. This weekend I didn't go to the BIG GAME! Oh no. I enjoyed staying home and talking on the phone while watching movies. Football bores me and after awhile, when you've seen one game..it's like you've seen them all. Saturday, I went to the beach with mi familia. We went to Drake's beach by Point Reyes. We just hiked and watched these morons try to free some sea lions. Mi madre said they were trained professionals with degrees. It looked like trained monkies to me. Hiking..what can I say? Who doesn't love to get all sweaty and hot? No, no. It really is fun when you finally reach your destination and look down upon the land you just conquered. :) Then we went home. On the drive there and back there was this really cool surf shop we passed. It's called HIPKAT SURF SHOP..I think. It had some Roxy and Paul Frank stuff. I'm starting to obsess over Paul Frank. He has a cool website. www.paulfrank.com. Sat night, I was watching Sixth Sense on ABC. Then, I got too scared to watch the rest so I walked to my room. In the dark. ALL ALONE. Today, I don't think we have anything planned. Oh yeah, Amanda called me last night too. Talked to her on the phone for a little. Her dad just moved to American Canyon, which is a lot closer than Concord(LOVE THAT MALL). So this week, she's staying at her dad's house. Normally, on Wednesdays, I go home with her b/c her mom's house is so close to my guitar teacher's house. (I have guitar on Wed @ 4:30.) So @ 4:30, I walk over to Peter's house. Then after, mi madre picks me up or I go back to Amanda's. This week since she's going to be at her dad's, I go 2 her house by  myself . Manda said it's okay and her mom "won't mind". I still feel weird about it...even though I've been there countless times. (We go back to very beginning of 8th grade.) She's always there for me. Like when "dogs" go out with people. "Dog" is lame. Seriously. No more talk of him though! Ahh. I can't wait to g2 Bakersfield. I love it sometimes. I get to see Terry and Bri. Also, shopping. I love it. I miss them all. We go there weekend of December 3. So be READY if you're reading this-->Sophia. She's the one that had this blog thingy. I decided to try it. Interesting..quite. ToodLes for now. I'm going to find something *FUN* to DooOoO. Yaaah. x0x0x0x.

       BEST TURKEY DAY MOMENT SO FAR:       I wouldn't go so far as to call it the best, but I was getting a piece of bread to eat. I stuck the bread into my mouth and was chewing on it. I look down at the bread where I just bit into it, and I realize, 'Hey, there's mold..' Then, it hit me. I ran to the garbage almost crying and spit it out. Then I spit some more. I'm probably going to die now. Good-bye Good-bye

      Nothing much is really happening. Ijust felt guilty for not writing and having all my fans (aha) be dissapointed. 2day-Having Thanks. Day dinner @ my house. Mi madre is going to cook for people. HAHAHA. This should be interesting. I hear back in the day she use to actually cook quite a variety of dishes. Then she had children (me & ZAC).          AwWw MaaaN. I'm so dissapointed. Mi amigos en Bako are all having fun times. Nonz, Terry, Bri & Justin(Bri's b/f) are goin' out to the ol' Shafter. I remember when I use to do that. G2 my gma's house for every holiday. Since we moved, however..we did the first year, but then we split up our holidays with others. Last Thanksgiving..I don't remember where we were. Last xmas we were in VA w/ Hartwell & Ginger(James' parents). Anyways. I was talking to Bri & Sophia. Sophia's bday is in a few days(DEC 3). I would tell you the correct amount of days till the joyous celebration, but seeing as how I don't know the present date...I can't. When I go on vaca all time seems to run together. I know there was a time @ Terry's that i totally forgot what or when it was.         Gosh, I really regret some things. How young and stupid I was just a few months ago. No REALLY. I can't believe some things I did (and a lot of them..fo  him ). Ew. Shoot me (not literally you psycho). AH! IT MAKES ME WANT TO YACK MY BRAINS OUT AND THEN WHEN I CAN'T DO THAT, CUT ALL MY SKIN OFF AND BURN IT. It sickens me beyond belief.     Anyways..           My jacket. My perfect xmas. MY dad said yes to what I asked for. Not like he wouldn't. That's one thing I like about not living in ol' Hell (Bako): since I don't see everyone as much..when  I do..SHOPPING GALORE. Yaaah. Even if it's every other month. I guess they feel guilty and give me MULa.         I told mi madre I didn't have enough clothes. She laughed. I was confused. Weird..or wierd?! ahh. SPELL CHECK!           Stalker Theory:        You always think about him/her/it. Him/her/it are the 1st things you think of when you wake up or the last thing you think of at night. It scares you. You tell yourself it's just a crush. Don't kid yourself. YOU'RE A STALKER. ahahahahahahhahahahah.

      Avril Lavigne-There's a lot of discussion here. The "punks" at school call her a "poser" and those that don't, look up to her. What makes the kids calling her a "poser" think they invented what "punks" should look like and decided to be fashion police? I thought they were tired of the "fashion" thing so they dress like  that  to be "different". If you know me then you know what I think about it. It's all bullcrap. Some people think they started this rebellious fashion statement but they haven't. Where do you think they got the idea?? It just popped in their head?? Wrong. The media told them to dress that way, and act that way. So why not stop worrying about what other people are wearing and just appreciate them for a human in having their own beliefs, customs and styles? There is a point to this continuous rambling, 1) Do what you want, don't try to be like others, be yourself, etc. 2) I like the song #4 on Lavigne's record. In fact, some would say Lloyd and I are obsessed with it...

      WeLL, 2day was a day of historic events.  In first period, I fainted. It started out with me just yawning and listening to the sex ed teacher talk about genital warts, and herpes. After I yawned about 6 times in 1minute, I started getting suspicious. I felt hot all over. I turned to Laura and said:"Ohh, I don't feel good." Then I tried to move around in my seat. When I couldn't take it anymore and I got the "feeling", I went to the teacher and whispered:"I need to go to the nurses office. I don't feel well..." That's the last I remember besides hearing something hit a chair or desk. I woke up on the ground. I looked up at Laura who was now sitting above me in a chair rather than across from the table from me. I knew what had happened. I put my hands to my face and said: "oH God. I told you I didn't feel good." The sex ed teacher and the regular teacher looked down on me along with the rest of the class. Then the regular teacher picked me up, I said:"Wait, don't I need my backpack?" and she held me as I walked through the hall to be greeted by the dean and Rick(my softball coach who also yard duties @ NHS). Rick took me from there and to the office. I said:"Whoa. I feel like I'm goin' to faint. Can I sit down on the floor?" And with out a reply I laid down in the office next to the juvenille delquents that were sent up there. Rick said:"C'mon let's go to the nurses office." Walking was one thing. They way things looked was another. It was like walking in a black and white speckled cartoon. MY head felt heavy and light at the same time. We got to the nurses station and I barfed. MY mom eventually got me and took me home. I called Heath's cell to tell her I couldn't go shopping today. :( HeR & LLoYd called back later, and already knew what had happened. They said a lot of people were concerned and talking about it. (Humph. This is still not embarassing to me, b/c this is not my first-public pass-out.) Heath also said that kids in the class said I hit my head really hard on the desk when I went down. I have no recollection of this, but can strongly say I believe it since my head hurts like hell now.   OTher than that, it was a fine day. The guy I like noticed I wasn't in class today. He asked me why and said class was boring, besides two retards getting sent to the dean for goofing off. As I was about to sign off he said: short people are always sexy. I said: except to you. He said: No 2 me 2. Me: :) Olala. I don't care if he knows it anymore. I think everything is completely obvious. ((If you don't get why this is of any importance, then you obviously don't know me. I'm as short as short can be. 5'0"!))  WeLL that is all I guess.     Artist : Oasis  Song : Wonderwall   Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna throw it back to you By now you should've somehow  Realize what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now  Backbeat the word was on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don't know how  Because maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me  And after all You're my wonderwall  Today was gonna be the day But they'll never throw it back to you By now you should've somehow Realize what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now  And all the roads that lead you there were winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me  And after all You're my wonderwall  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me  And after all You're my wonderwall  Said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me(x3)

      Goin' on: this n that.  Kind of...not entertained right now. Trying to find something that holds my interest.   I haven't really talked to LLoYd all weekend. LLoYd, if you read this: CALL ME.  HuMm.."dOg". Yes, haven't talked to him since the beginning of break. Ha. What a laugh. LLoYd asked me why I even like him. I don't know really. I guess I see different things in people. Take BNP for example. I don't see anything now, and am surprised I ever saw something. But, at one point, I did. I think it was the chase that drew me in. Other (dumb) girls wanted him and he was going out at the time I wanted him. So his g/f thought he was doin' the *dirtydirty* and dumped him. I guess it's the feeling of: 'o0o does he like me? does he not?' I remember that feeling very well. It's now more 'can he hold my interest after he returns his?' -That is very important. I don't know about you, but I sometimes find myself bored with the current fling. Just sayin'...  Does it ever seem fake to you? Sometimes I feel like things that were important last week no longer are worth mentioning. I easily let things go b/c I don't care enough to keep them going. Especially drama.   I realize that there are always going to be boneheads in life. You can't escape them, and it scares me. There's people always thinking in their ignorant ways and it infuriates me that I can't change their mind.   It also kind of frightens me that people might actually read this. A lot of people are surprised when they really get to know me. I guess I give the wrong impression..?? I've been told it's more of a goody-goody, sweetie-airhead thing, or psycho. I don't think people see me as a person that thinks...unless..they do. Hah. That makes sense.   xxx000  -crackELhead-

      Some idiot I know but will not name called me a poser. ME..POSER? OF WHAT? I don't try to dress like the musicians I like. I don't try to dress like an Abercrombie model. I don't try to dress like a hot topic person. I dress like me. So how can I pose if it's what I am? He just didn't like my Good Charlotte icon. I don't know anything about GC other than the facts 1) Cierra owns a copy of their CD, and I saw it like..in 6th grade in her room and thought it looked..interesting. 2) they sing that rich&famous song.

      1.  You are attracted to those who have split personality, like cold     as ice on the outside, but hot as fire in the heart.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is stylish.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is insecure.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is that both of you can talk about everything and     anything, no secret is kept.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You always want to get married, but in fact, you don't even know     what it really is.  8.  At this moment, you are quite self-centered; you think of love as     something you can get and trash anytime you want.  My test results from  urlLink AnImAL TeSt

      I don't get it. Why would 19-22 20-12 12-6-7 with 19-22-9? It doesn't make any sense. Am 18 13-12-7 20-12-12-23 22-13-12-6-20-19? 23-26-5-18-23 said that I am fine and 13-12-7 21-26-7. I suppose that's good, but it doesn't stop 14-22 from wondering if 18 26-14.  He 21-15-18-9-7-22-23 with 14-22 all 8-11-26-13-18-8-19. Go figure. It all is like a 15-18-22.   Movin' to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, I'm movin to the country, gonna eat me alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches.  Peaches come, from a can, They were put there by a man, In a factory downtown. And if I had my little way, Id eat peaches everyday, Sun soakin' bulges in the shade.  Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches, Movin to the country, gonna eat alot of peaches.  I took a little nap where the roots all twist, Squished a rotten peach in my fist, And dreamed about you, woman I poked my finger down inside, make a little room for an ant to hide, Nature's candy in my hand, or can, or pie.

      StiLL happy. eatin' sunshine for breakfast. hell, i'm shittin' sunshine. YaYa. Mm. fun times this happiness.  Gosh. It's their fault. LLoYd helped me see that. I LOVE YOU LLOYD! Ur the best.  LlOyDz LEtTeR 2 ME!:   Oh my god! I got so tired of hearing that name! supposively she's really popular at THAT SKOOL, which to me doesn't mean much since- well it is THAT SKOOL! lame THAT SKOOL  kids...half of them are going to die of starvation by trying to become an artist because of THAT SKOOL that makes kids think they can really become rich and famous from drawing...please...REALITY PEOPLE! the only famous artist I know of are dead! and so what if she is semi-popular at some school full of dumb little kids...there's only like 150 dumb little kids there anyway and if DOG likes her, his loss he's crazy and if you guys did happen to get married (which I'd try desperately to stop) he'd probably end up burning your house down or something...don't trip on him. I think of DOG as a BNP,yea maybe a little cuter but take away his semi- ok looks and take away the pyroticness and you've ended up with another BNP, you don't want that- do you?   POP QUIZ : "BNP and DOG, what do they both have in common?"- HOST  "They're both icky!"-contestant "Correctomundo!!...what do we got for em' Johnny?!"-host yes yes how sad it is...anyways yea, so call me @ my dads -Lloyd  ((*ALL NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED..EXCEPT LLOYD'S*))

      2morrow, I'm goin' 2 Bako for the weekend. Leaving b4 10am and returning Monday DAY.   Next week I'm over @ Lloyd's and we're gunna cruise around Concord Mall. But we're only buying a little cuz we're saving our real stuff for our one love. We both share the same love. :-*  So...G&H leave tomorrow and catch their flight @ 6am.   Huumph.  I don't know what else to talk about.  One of KdAwG's songs r stuck in my head:    She had to walk with a silicon cock sticking in her ass and one in her cunt. A butterfly vibrator strapped tight to her clit, But who's got the remote control?  That would belong to Louise, She got a new pet a vaginal tease. Mommy's litte girl aint gonna do what she please, If she don't wanna get a spankin'  She likes to speak like a six year old brat Mommy discipline me, you know i've been bad. Start witht a cat and she'll move to a crop Neither on is wiling to stop.  She knows that girls just wanna have fun, With four piercings on each side of her labia. A little luggage lock connecting each one, Prevents her girl from going astray.  Slut you think you've seen your master mean, You better lick my puss and asshole clean. Treat my clit like bubble gum, Bitch make me cum.  Its time for bed shell secure her head Between her thighs for a thorough nights suck Along with this shell be drinking her piss So Louise dont have to get up.  Two goddesses in love One resides below one reigns from above One adorns cuffs while one covets keys The purgatorial touch of Louise.."-NoFx

      I've been so overwhelmed since school got out that I have long ignored my duties of continually describing my most adventurous days.   Friday was discouraging. I found myself with a heavy heart. While the normals went about their routines, I felt akward and isolated. Perhaps the anticipation for break was beginning to wear on me. In any case, I spent the evening about in my PJs and enjoying the sweet melodies of another sufferer on the stereo. I thought my uppers and downers were over. I suppose it is all a state of mind.   I am deeply longing for the sweet morning of Christmas. The open fire hearth and cheery smiles of the morning should broaden my spirits. Until then I remain melancholy stationed in this position.    "And then she realized...they're all the SAME!"- notepad I looked over at a darling boutique in Sanoma. On the notepad, there is a woman accepting two different arms from two different gentlemen. Quite intriguing.

      He struts around like he's a bad ass when really he's done nothing incriminating. He's so fucking ugly, you wonder what happened in the birthing process. And you wonder, which parent was hideous? He gives you these sob stories so you feel sorry for him. He pretends he's a fuck up. You find the "bad boy" image exciting. You get wrapped up in it all and forget your sanity. Soon you're delirious saying things that you "like him". Get out. Now. Before it's too late. You might think you'll regret leaving him, but really after you're out of it and looking back, you'll regret not getting out sooner.

      MY Quiz results.   You scored 40%    The Sensitive Guy  Isn't he sweet? You definitely go for the guy who has a serious case of feelings -- whether he wears them on his sleeve or not. Manners seem important to him, and to you. And it's a good bet your soul mate would as easily tune in to ballads on the radio as he would stage a protest against cruelty to animals. Tapping into his soft side, however, may not always be so easy. A guy who's clued in to his feelings may also be protective of them. So if you find yourself face-to-face with one of these sweeties, don't wait for him to make the first move. Let him know you want to get to know him better. Sensitive types think with their heart as well as their brain -- he'll get the hint.  Humm. Sounds good. Like one of those emo-grunge-look-college guys. A sensitive and intellectual guy is very appealing. Especially if he's a rocker.

      Got this from a forward:   A poem for girls....   I shave my legs I sit down to pee.  And I can justify  any shopping spree.  Don't go to a barber but a beauty salon.  I can get a massage  without a hard-on.  I can balance the checkbook  I can pump my own gas.  Can talk to my friends  about the size of my ass. My beauty's a masterpiece  and yes, it takes long.  At least I can admit  to others when I'm wrong. I don't drive in circles at any cost.  And I don't have a problem  admitting I'm lost.  I never forget  an important date.  You just gotta deal with it  I'm usually late.  I don't watch movies  with lots of gore.  Don't need instant replay  to remember the score.  I won't lose my hair I don't get jock itch.  And just cause I'm assertive  Don't call me a bitch.  Don't say to your friends  Oh yeah, I can get her  In your dreams, my dear  I can do better!  Flowers are okay  But jewelry's best.  Look at me you idiot Not at my chest.  I don't have a problem  With Expressing my feelings.  I know when you're lying  You look at the ceiling.  DON'T call me a GIRL   a BABE or a CHICK .  I am a WOMAN.  Get it, you DICK?    huMm..now I think that's for those little girls that are mad at little boys.

Porcelain  Are you wasting away in your skin  Are you missing the love of your kin  Drifting and floating and fading away   Porcelain  Do you smell like a girl when you smile  Can you bear not to share with your child  Drifting and floating and fading away   Little lune  All day  Little lune   Porcelain  Do you carry the moon in your womb  Someone said that youre fading too soon  Drifting and floating and fading away   Porcelain  Are you wasting away in your skin  Are you missing the love of your kin  Nodding and melting and fading away   Little lune  All day  Little lune...

      HAHAHA. I was bored and no one was online. On my AOL welcome screen, there's always a quote that some AOL user said. I clicked on it and it brought me to this:   Subject: Re: abercrombie or american eagle Date: 12/23/2002 9:32 AM Pacific Standard Time From: Dannyboone11491 Message-id:     Hey i saw this little post thing that u've got going here and Abercrombie and AE are both kewl places however Im a very cheap person and the cheapest shirt i eva bought a AF was $20 and at AE $2.50 (thats right 2 dollars and 50 cents). Has ne 1 ever heard of a store called Aeropostale? It is a great store kinda like american eagle but the clothes dont look as worn out. They are like in the middle between AE & AF.  Oh by the way this goes to all the gothz/ skaters that think "preppy clothes r gay" all i have to say is if im driving in my car and i get pulled over i am less likley to get a ticket because i dont look like  friggin batman or somthing else weird. Personally i think all goths are jealous that they cant look half as good as preps do Dan    HAHA. BATMAN ROCKS!

       Teen Celebrity Match      Score! Your celebrity match is Heath Ledger!    Heath Ledger   C'mon, you know there's a part of you that dreams about being swept off your feet by a blond-haired, blue-eyed rebel. Today's your lucky day. You've been matched with Heath Ledger because he's strong enough to make his own decisions.   From the land that brought us Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, Heath's the latest tough guy to rise up from Down Under. And even on the verge of mega-stardom, Heath treats everyone with respectfrom costars to fans.   Heath has no problem going head-to-head against Hollywood expectations. No more teen flicks for him (unless of course he wants them).   A date with young Ledger could very well begin in a quiet bistro in some undiscovered, hip part of town. Granted, you're going to have a hard enough time resisting his Aussie accent. But after dinner, when he gets you on the dance floor, make sure there's a chair nearby. He'll have your head spinning just as fast as your heart.     HELL YAH! HEATH IS HOTT!  ToOdLes.

      Which candy heart are you? I am:   Hot Stuff   When you reach into the candy heart bag, there's no doubt you're coming up with a fire red heart that reads "Hot Stuff." It's not so much a label as it's your style  turning heads, getting numbers and raising room temperatures a few degrees when you walk through the door.   You'd love someone who could match your flame-throwing ways, but so far, everyone just melts like wax when you turn on the heat.   Got a romantic fireside dinner planned for you and your very own hottie? Better keep a hose nearby because sparks could start flying.   And if you're still on the prowl, waiting to find someone who can hold their own against your undeniable sense of romance and action, keep a close watch. They're sure to come around soon when they see your "Hot Stuff" coming their way.

       Article on drug warning signs:    Warning Signs It can be hard to know the difference between normal childhood behavior and behavior caused by drug use. Changes in hairstyle or dress may alarm parents but may be normal behaviors. On the other hand, changes that are extreme or sudden may signal drug use.   It may help to ask yourself the following questions:   Does my child seem withdrawn, depressed, or tired?  Has my child become hostile or uncooperative?  Have my child's relationships with other family members changed?  Has my child dropped his old friends?  Has my child lost interest in or drastically changed his appearance?  Has my child lost interest in hobbies, sports, or other favorite activities?  Have my child's eating or sleeping patterns changed?  Does my child suffer from headaches, nosebleeds, or other physical problems for no apparent reason?  Have I noticed the odor of chemicals or drugs around my child?  Do aerosol products at home seem to be used much too quickly?   Positive answers to such questions may indicate drug use. However, these signs may also apply to a child who is not using drugs but who may have other problems, such as depression or an eating disorder.   Be aware of common drug paraphernalia. Possession of items such as pipes, rolling papers, small medicine bottles, cans of whipped cream or other aerosol products, or syringes may signal that your child is using drugs.

      Nothing  Nothing's good.  Nothing's right. Nothing lets me sleep all night. Because when I get up nothing will be there. Nothing shows that no one cares. Nothing is with me all the time. Nothing is on my mind. Nothing is feared. Nothing is weird. Nothing is my only friend. Nothing will be here in the end. Nothing helps me through the day. Nothing and no one shows me the way. I live for nothing. I get nothing. Nothing is me.

      I came online b/c I got bored watching BOB VILLA's t.v. show my mom is obsessed with. Mr. Villa went to some store which stocks up old wardrobes. My mom also has an obsession with wardrobes and that show isn't helping. All Mr. Villa is doing is talking to a clerk about the wardrobe. They call that "entertainment".  I went to Ana Nuevo yesterday with mi familia. We watched elephant seals..Oh JoY. :-P As we were driving there I thought I was going to die b/c I had the hugest headache and felt like I was going to barf.   Certain people keep mentioning to me that VDay is coming up. They like me but are trying to be secretive. I don't like anyone.  That's all for now..

      I got up @ Kassidy's. Her dad drove us to sball thingy. Kelly drove us back to Kassidy's. Called my mom. Came home. Went online. Slept. Showered. Got back into PJs. Thinking things over. The kid I dumped. Yah. Great times. His friends are standing on my neck trying to get my to reconsider. I have my own problems to deal with. I don't need his also. They say he's suicidal. Whoa: that is only 1/3 of the teenagers in the US. Everyone is suicidal unless they're some kind of happy freak. I am not suicidal but I think things would be much easier if I were gone. I also don't want to be responsible for this boy's death. What to do..What to do..?  "This is my stop.  Time to get off. Excuse me.  Excuse me. Not trying to be direct.

      Hi. I haven't written in awhile. A lot has happend. Nothing worth mentioning...besides some fat whore named "Cunt" is getting all ghetto towards me thinking she can scare me off. Also, I went out with a kid and dumped him. Yeah, that's it. Tonight I'm heading over to Kassidy's. Lloyd is @ her dad's. I don't like blogger.com. In fact, it's just as bad as AOL. Whatever. Anyway. "Dog" business. That's over. School has pretty much been the same. I can't stand math class. I have softball everyday from 2-5. I hate the phrase: "Woo..hoo!" I have been listening to STROKE 9 over and over again the past week. I stare at the ceiling and listen. It's a crazy world. Radiohead is fucking awesome. I like "High and Dry". In fact, that was my favortie song a few summers ago. Yeah, so tomorrow I have to wake up bright and early to go work at a crab frestival or something. This is the annual fund raiser for school sports. The freshman sball team has to go. Rick(coach) is bringing doughnuts. Yum. I hate corn. I like Doritos though. That's mighty good corn. I don't understand how someone can know someone so well yet at the same time be so confused and feel separated from them. I guess that makes sense if you know what I mean. What the hell is wrong with me anyway? I hate it when people act shallow but I do it myself b/c I'm afraid of getting fat. The end.

      "Bird" wanted to come over but I told him "no". I don't want to see anyone today. I got TUCK EVERLASTING from the movie store today. I remember when Lloyd and I saw that. We cried for thirty minutes straight. Haha. What dorks. I have yet to watch it.   Finch is awesome.  It's a beautiful day. Yet, I feel misplaced. I think too much about things that shouldn't be thought about.     "Here I am beside myself again Im torn apart by words that you said All in all, I know were falling apart Where did you run to so far away And here we are to sing you a song And there you are asleep against the windowpane Just like always You said you like to hear the rain sometimes All I can do is tell you the truth Oh my eyes will the tell you the same Here we are to sing you a song And there you are asleep again Grasping our hands together, we feel we are one result"-Finch, "Ender"

      I've decided I like AFI because of this song. Their CD has never gotten this much use from me.    I saw a star beneath the stairs glowing through the melting walls.  Who will be the first to begin their fall?  Or will we become one?  Am I the star beneath the stairs?  Am I a ghost upon the stage?  Am I your anything? I saw a star beneath the stairs glowing bright before descent  and in the morning there is nothing left but what's inside of me.	 And I don't want to die tonight; will you believe in me?  And I don't want to fall into the light.  Will you wish upon?  Will you walk upon me? I don't want to die tonight.  Will you.

      Today, I'm going shopping with my mother and possibly KAtie. Just getting some pants since the vast majority of back to school shopping was done awhile ago. After, we're going to see tomb raider. I had weird dreams last night. A lot of my dreams lately have involved The White Stripes. I also dreamed that I was a ride operator, I could talk to people through a radio, and that I was always late for softball. Weird times. The other night I dreamed something so horrible and in my dream I was full-on crying. I woke up and my eyes were watering but I never had a dream effect me like so. InTeREStiNg. I'm tired. I miss Ian. :( He's going to miss the NV fair. School starts too soon and I have a conference to get my schedule on the 13th.  I have to sign up for drivers training then. JoY* I'm taking: alg2, art, his, bio, eng, and...?? It'll be great when I can drive. I'll get my license March of next year. HA--> It's weird that Ian's birthday is March 10th and mine is March 16th. AmAzinG. I can't wait for school..not. Well at least I'll be a sophomore now. I get to go off campus LEAGALLY this year. WeLL tOOdLE LOO.

      I hate it when I sign online and fivebiZiLLion people who have nothing better to do, IM me. They do it to get some kind of entertainment. The only people I like talk to are: Narissa, Nelisse, Katie, DAvid, Kelsey(if she's ever on), Matt C., Mathew S., Gabe, Wick and a few others. Everyone else just annoys the fucking shit out of me.   Example(*names have been changed*):   DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:00PM):  HEY ELYSE!!!!!!!  Me(8:05PM):  hello  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:05PM):  WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!  Me(8:08PM):  nothing  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:08PM):  OH MY GOD THE OTHER DAY I WENT SHOPPING AND I SAW THE HOTTEST GUY EVERR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH. HE HAD ONE OF THOSE PREPPY SHAGS. NOT sO Sk8Er Boi MORE LIkE PrEP!  Me(8:12PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:12PM):  I BOUGHT A SHIRT FROM ABERCROMBIE! IT'S SOOOO CUtEe. IT HAS BLA BLA BLA AND IT LOOKS LIKE AVRIL'S!! OH MY GOD!  Me(8:16PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:16PM):  I HELLLLLLA waNT tO GO To tHE LAaaaaaKE. OH MY GOD. IT'S sOooooo FUn ThEre B/c THEre'S heLLLLLLLa HoT GuYS!  Me(8:24PM):  cool  DiRtYSkAnKYhoE(8:24PM):  WeLL I GoTTa MoToR tO tHE CoaTEr..HeheHEeHeHeeh. BYEEEEEE. xOxOX. I lOOOOOVe YoOUU.  Me(8:30PM):  bi  AOL--> The last message was not sent because   DiRtYSkAnKYhoE   is offline.   ....That's mainly how it goes. The person will tell me about their pathetic life or how they think *this guy* is "hott" this week. They have no substance and eventually when I don't join in their conversation about themself they stop talking to me or leave. Ha, it amuses me in some sense. Most times I don't respond but lately I've felt nice.

      Today I woke up at 8 in the morning because my mom said my breakfast was getting cold. My mom never makes breakfast and I never eat it. Today however, I thought I should. It was coffee cake. YuM. Then I got ready because I had to go get some shoes since the ones I got from Norsdstrom's have a broken shoelace hole(stupid ass store and their fucked shoes).  Well, we went to the Napa Outlets. What..a...selection(sarcasm). I did find some in a discount shoe store. They were cute and called "Serena by Sam and Libby". Only problem, they resembled shoes my grandma would wear crossed with ballet slippers. I didn't get them.   We went home. I went online for awhile because I have nothing to do since I'm grounded till Wednesday. I talked to Narissa. I forgot how talking to a friend can be so enjoyable. I told her about what's going on with me. Then she said she was going to write a poem about me. She writes very descriptive, good poems-->  urlLink CHECK THEM OUT.    Anyway, my computer was lame and kicked me off. Then I tried to sign back on but the DSL "couldn't find a connection". By the time I got back on, everyone was off. Such a joy*  Needless to say I got off and went to see what people in my household were doing. My brother is not grounded(lucky bastard) and was going to play soccer. My mom was doing whatever but she told me if I took my laces out of my shoes they lace-hole problem was fixed and the shoes look cuter. HA and they do. They're suppose to be ballerina type things. They're pink sneaker type things with long laces to wrap around your ankle. Take the laces out and you've just got on a slip-in shoe. They kind of look like converse all-stars. Only they're not because I hate those shoes.   Yes..my life is so very interesting. Actually I usually neglect this blogger thing but I'm looking for some titillation.   Ian's going somewhere with His friend Matt tomorrow. Ian called me yesterday but hasn't called since. Oh well.   I'm going to Chef's this Friday because WEDNESDAY, I'm off  GROUndiNg .  Watch out !!

      You think you know a person but you really don't. You think you're they're friend but you really aren't. It's a shattering feeling to know that you mean nothing.

              I liked it better when you were quiet.      Now you're loud. And sociable. I liked it when you were shy. I liked you.  I don't know what I do now.

         So I had this idea to cut my hair    at 12am last night. So I did. I tried to make it short in the back and long in the front. It looks  interesting . A lot of people were saying they liked it today + didn't believe that I actually cut it.  But I did.  Next time, I'll go for a run. Waste my energy on other things. *This boy* I know is dumb. He wants my poon + he is always all over me. I hate it. He wants to talk to thisotherkid for some reason + be like:"Is it okay if I like Elyse?" I think that is bullshit. I am no one's property + he shouldn't involve thisotherkid. Besides I don't even like this dumb boy. He always makes sexual advances towards me at school. Whatevs.  I wanted to hang out with Sarah, Matt, Jon  Another wasted Friday night.  Maybe tomorrow will be better. I leave for Bakersfield the day school gets out. I am excited. Kinda.

         Today, I saw  through  you.        I'm always blind in my dreams. I can't open my eyes   w  i  d  e  enough. All I see is  white  and sunlight. I want to see  so  badly but I can't. I can never see.      Today  I saw purely though. I saw inside of you. I saw the true you. I  don't  like you. I use to but you've changed. You're  completely  not the same.  I shouldn't have pushed it. But that's what I do.  I push.          And Push.                       And Push.  Until you go away. Then I say, "Well I guess you never liked      I  love  how you lie to me. Makes me feel good inside. I soak up your lies + believe them as truths. Lies are sometimes better than reality. Lie to me, becos I'll believe you. I  want  to believe you.  But the little things don't matter as much anymore...  I'm over it.  But then again I'm not. I'm just numb to everything  again .   I'm in my own world  again .  It's in my head. A deep stage of denial. It makes me strong.   Becos I escape you, he, she, it, them, us. Gone.  I love it.   ...Hey  boy , take a  look  at  me  Let me  dirty   up  your mind...      Today you saw me. And you were scared. You knew I saw through you. You knew I didn't care. I love how you're completely not what I want. I love how you completely are. I love how I like you completely. I love how you complete me.     Isn't it queer when you think you know someone so much but it turns out you really don't? I love being dissapointed, don't you? Don't you love feeling like the world is coming unglued? Don't you love staying up all night becos you're manic moods won't let you sleep? Don't you love sleeping all day becos thoughts are too much to think?  Don't you love it?   Don't   you   love  it? Don't you? You've gotta love it. Becos you do it to yourself  over  and  over  again.  Stupid girl.  Elyse   I can't move on. But I can't take it. I want to move on. But I can't fake it.

         me.  I've decided I like this place better than teenopendiary right now. So I will start writing in here again. Nothing too exciting is going on. I guess I should catch everyone up on what's been happening.  The last time I wrote in here was like summer. Basically, Ian + I lasted a really long time(+5months). Till November, then I dumped him. He was too annoying. I then dated my best guy friend, Johnny, for a couple of weeks. That was a bad idea becos he was also my best friend Narissa's love. Then I dated a freshman, David Laning. I liked him. I'm single right now. Technically. I cut my hair. It was so long. I cut it to about my chin. It dyed it black, then undyed it. It's to my shoulders now. Katie + I are still really good friends we just don't hang out everyday anymore. Mainly becos I go to Justin-Siena now. It's the private catholic school. Not my choice. I ditched, drank, + smoked too much so my mom sent me there. During Christmas break, I was sent to my dad's. It was basically like rehab, no drugs, no alcohol, just focusing on myself. It helped a lot. Helped me accept going to Justin + I shouldn't waste my life away. Justin's alright though. I've made some cool new friends.  I can't control my alcohol. I learn things the hard way. I was okay but then in February, I got suspended for drinking on campus which now I'm in AA for. Then I later got expelled, on my birthday (MARCH 16th) for having alcohol on campus. It was a present from someone. Yeah, so I was out of school for +2 weeks. I didn't do anything. I just stayed at home or wandered around town. Sarah, Matt D + Greg made it worthwhile though. They visited me a lot. They're good friends.  I liked Greg for awhile + he liked me. Then I ruined it about a month ago. I went to Narissa + Nelisse's house + got too drunk. I jumped out of his car + basically just had him be my sober bitch. It was terrible. He didn't really talk to my for a week after that. And we haven't kissed since then. So I don't know. We talk. We're just good friends right now. I'm okay with that. Most of the time.. Summer's soon anyway. I'm going to go to my dad's again. I will be there for +1 month. It's how my mom gets rid of me. And I have to say I pretty much enjoy it. I have friends there. Plus it's relaxing. I don't get depressed while I'm there. I love it. I can't take school anymore. It's terrible. I'm probably going to be ditching a lot these last 3 weeks. I'm about to strangle everyone.    A lot of things have changed    This blog was with me at the beggining of my alcohol addiction. Hopefully it will be with me in the end. I'm getting it under control. I've been sober 30 days. This is a record for me. Plus, they've finally got me on anti-depressants. My posts probably won't be as bipolar as they use to. I don't feel as much. I'm going to start smoking pot full time now. I'm buying a bubbler. I'm not addicted to pot so I won't have a problem with it. And whenever I feel like drinking I will smoke. I cam control myself stoned.  Right now, it's Sunday. It's 9:44 am. I don't think I'll be doing much today.  Sarah should be back from Hawaii soon. School tomorrow. David Williamson has been calling lately. I messed around with him awhile ago. Now he calls whenever he wants poon. I made a new friend. His name is Jon. He's my friend Vanessa's friend. I think he's really cute. He thinks I'm cute too. Mmm. Narissa + Nelisse seem to be busy doing their own thing. I miss them a lot. Last time I hung out with Katie was like 3 weeks ago + we went to the beach. I got a killer tan, man.  I just don't know anything anymore. I'm tired with all the drama of the year. I'm ready for it to be over. I just don't care anymore. I've had enough shit this year it seems like I'm 40. I feel older than I am. I've had to deal with a lot more shit than most people my age. I'm tired. No wonder I sleep all day. There's so much more I want to say I just don't know how to get it all out.  I've so completely screwed myself this whole year + now I'm recoupperating. Maybe one day I will be sane. For the past few weeks, I've puked up everything I've eaten. I can't handle it in my tummy. I feel it. And it drives me mad. Sometimes I puke blood. Most times, puke comes out my nose. I know you're thinking  ew that's gross you have a problem . But deal with it. It's my fucking body + my choices. I know I'm unhealthy. I've always been. I'm working on it. It still doesn't help the fact I think I'm fat. Or ugly. That's one thing I did when I was drunk, I kept saying "I'm so fat + ugly." I don't care if you don't think so. Becos I don't care what you think. I care what I think. I know this is self-destructive + unhealthy. But that's what I am. You don't have to be okay with it, you don't even have to accept it. But this is how it is. I'm so tired of people telling me how I should be. Fuck them. This is how I am. I'm dealing with it.  It's all just a phase. I'm hoping everything will one day pass. Like a bad dream. One day I will wake up. Let me sleep till then.  Elyse

        This weekend I lived in my bathing suit.    Friday:  went over to Sarah's after school. Hung out. Later that night went to Katie's. Watched ALMOST FAMOUS + dating shows.   Saturday:  Got up, went to the lake with Kt + Kathe + Kathe's friend. Sat in the sun. Baked. Kayaking. Avoiding fishes. Came home. Went over to my house. Stayed up all night online. Fell asleep.  Sunday:  Went to Kt's Nana's. Swam. Watched SCARY MOVIE 3 + I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU NOT. Some Claire Danes   Monday: Went home about 11. Studied for finals.   This  week will be eventless. As far as I can tell. But soon enough it will be Thursday. And that is the last day of school. Friday I will leave to Bako. I'm trying to get Kt to come with me. Hella sick fukka. Yuh man.    I let MTV brainwash me today + I came away with wanting to buy the new Janet Jackson album.    I'm peacin homes.  Elyse

        fcuk    it's another late night. you know the routine. up too late. can't go to bed. I'm wired man. Real wired. I can't sleep. Sleep would ruin me. Gotta keep the manic mode. Haven't showered in two days. I bet I'm real sexy. You know I am. But enough with the bullshiot. I'm hurting someone who is very nice to me. And I like it. Why? Becos I'm a biotch. Fcuk yah. I'm a fcuking whore. Dude. I love being so cool in every way. But I don't really. I don't really enjoy it. I don't enjoy anything. Becos it's fake. Becos they follow the crowd. BEcos they talk about the same things everyday. Becos I do the same thing.  I am on a self destructive roller coaster. Wanna join?
