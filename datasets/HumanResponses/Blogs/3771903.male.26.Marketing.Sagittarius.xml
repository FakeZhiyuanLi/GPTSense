      So I've spent the past two hours driving in a big fat circle trying to find the addresse of a golf course that was given to me by the city manager.  Until now, I hadn't realized that this man must've just set down the crack pipe when I called becasue the addresse he gave me is nowhere near where this golf course actually is.  Now, if he doesn't take this serisouly and for that matter doesn't even know his town, then why should I?  Why have I been out taping for 4 hours?  Why was I up at the ass-crack of dawn to drive an hour and a half then fly for 4 with the lovely pleasure of rounding it all off by sitting in gridlcok traffic for 2 hours.  All just to get to a town that doesn't even give a rats ass that I'm here.  At least I got to sit on the banks of Lake Michigan and take in the sights of morbidly obese women thinking that they're attractive.  On the up side I got to have a real Chicago Hot Dog, but the sight of the fatties almsot made me throw it back up.  Hell, prolly would've been the best thing the 'gulls have eaten all month.  Now I'm off to go find something to do to keep me out of my hotel as much as possible.  Maybe I'll get my hair cut... maybe I'll go on that killing spree I've wanted so much.  Maybe I'll go cruise around downtown Chicago.  I'll prolly just beat my head into a concrete wall though- it's cheaper and offers all the same exciting thrills.

      So, I've had (guesstimating) 10 shots of my Crown Royal.    I hear stories all the time from people... "OH MY GOD!  I was out last night and had, like, 8 shots and I was so wasted that I did things I never thousght I'd do"   Hell, I've heard them say stuff about 5 or 6.   It's making me wonder...  is somehting wrong with me, or is something wrong with them?  then I think back to wed and I know that there's something wrong with me.  Now, I can point the finger in a million and one directions- work, stress, inability to be able to relax since the only real time I get to sit down & REALLY relax is twice a week (1 night this week).  But those are excuses.  I am really beginning to think I have a problem.  Not so much with alcohol, but with "cruches".  Just, something to help me be able to relax.  I'm looking at my calander on my wall... not a single week without a cruch, ever.  Am I this weak?    It's 12:30 and I have to be on the road in 5 hours to catch my flight out of Buffalo.  I'm cruising around Illinois this week.  I have 13 hour days in front of me so I can't say I'll touch this for the week.  we'll see...

      Contempt and hatred for most that exists courses through my veins as I emptied another glass. I hate Birmingham MI. Overpriced, watered down drinks with a holier-than-thou attitude. I fucking hate it. DeVinci wasn't as good a painter as most of these women, and the flesh tone cake must be the 'in' thing right now. If I saw another guy flash a marble smile I think I'm gonna head-butt them, or at the very least run my hand through their skull and rip out some brain.  I don't know where this anger comes from. A fire hydrant of hatred that just can not be shut off. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I hadn't spent more than 15 hours at my own house in three weeks. Maybe it was because I was in Detroit again, and I hate Detroit.  Whatever it was, I wanted to fight.  I wanted to bleed

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mall is ugly. All malls are ugly. Big-fat-nothing functional rectangles. This one’s huge, four stories. For my birthday, we’re going to see a movie. This is nostalgic, because that used to be my birthday wish every year, growing up. That’s all I ever wanted: a movie. I used to get all tingly in my fingers and toes, butterflies in my stomach, adrenaline in my veins. Every new story used to do that to me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I could pinpoint when that stopped happening, so I could undo whatever it was that changed.        ~Chad T.

      I took a sip of my drink, smiling at the fact that my 8 day sober streak was ending.&nbsp; I gazed at the faces around me, all friends of the bartender, and all speaking Russian.&nbsp; They would laugh at a joke and I would fake a smile as if I actually knew what the hell they just said.&nbsp; The bartender was nice enough to translate the joke for me- it wasn't that funny, so I popped on that fake smile again.   3 drinks later the bartender goes over to the piano and starts playing.&nbsp; The ivories sang a song unlike anything I had heard before, and when his friend started singing I fought back a tear.&nbsp; it was astounding, this music, so beautiful, so alive and sad, and I couldn't understand a word of it and it didn't matter.&nbsp; Music is universal and the cosmos of this bar was my home.  Two songs later it was time for a refill.&nbsp; The bartender busy, the owner came over and made my drink.&nbsp; 3/4 beam, 1/4 Coke, just the way I like it.&nbsp; He held the drink dispenser in front of me, "This is the button for the Coke, got it?"&nbsp; He says to me as he set the bottle of Jim Beam in front of me.&nbsp; I nodded, he walked away, and I got shit-faced like I haven't been in a long time- well, at least 8 days.   The bartender played music.&nbsp; His friend sang.&nbsp; I sat their in drunken delight.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;don't remember finishing the bottle.   When the morning broke I found myself on the hotel room floor, unsure if I had fallen out of bed or if I hadn't made it in it to begin with, I was just pleased to be in my ROOM.&nbsp; It was a new day with the sun shining, the birds singing and a hangover to go down in history, and I was the happiest little shit in the world.

      I stood in awe of the intricate jade carving standing about 5 feet high.&nbsp; The detail was simply breathtaking, and I never have, nor ever will, see anything like it again.&nbsp; The little people sitting around a table meditaing, you can see the slits of their eyes- one of them was peeking (that would've been me).&nbsp;   It was part of an  urlLink exibit  at Chicagos Field Museum dedicated to Emperor Qianlong.&nbsp; It took me rougly an hour and a half to gaze at all the artifacts on display, and each was just as facinating as the last.&nbsp; To think, they did this detailed work 300 years ago and I can't even get half of my shots level.&nbsp; Good ole western&nbsp;up-bringing I guess. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      The clock next to me keeps ticking.&nbsp; Tick.&nbsp; Tock.&nbsp; Tick.&nbsp; Tock.&nbsp; The minutes go by as I ponder why I haven't had a drink all week.&nbsp; It's the first time in a long while that I've gone a work week without one, and a much longer while since I've gone without one on a Friday.&nbsp; I write this very detached from my usual self.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  First off, I'm in a hotel.&nbsp; Not that this is out of the ordinary for me, but because it's a weekend and I'm STILL in this hotel, and only now have I discovered that they had a computer I could use.&nbsp; Secondly, I'm sober.&nbsp; Thirdly, and this is the most peculiar one, I don't mind being here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Last night, I sat with a client of ours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name was Jamie.&nbsp; She runs a Mexican restaurant and&nbsp;fed me some very interesting dishes that I have always been to afraid (and cheap) to try.&nbsp; We had some good conversation as well, but I slowly began to realize the dynamic of what was happening.&nbsp; She was feeling sorry for me and the life that I have chosen to live.  &nbsp;  Sympathy is what turned me into a person I had never wanted to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;A person that I have tried 3 years now to change, to a mildly disappointing success, but I digress.&nbsp; Why did she feel sorry for me?&nbsp; because she couldn't do this?&nbsp; Because she thinks me living my life this way is sad?&nbsp; It's abnormal, no doubt about that but so am I so I think it fits rather well.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I could see it in her eyes as she talked to me.&nbsp; I appreciated the effort, don't get me wrong, it is nice to actually be able to TALK to somebody during the week other than myself.&nbsp; But still, not like this.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At a lull in the conversation I asked her why she felt compelled to keep me entertained.&nbsp; I can entertain myself thank you, that's why I bought my Game Boy.&nbsp; She was taken aback, rightfully so.&nbsp; Then the mood changed, one of those you can just feel in the air; she looks at me and says "Well look at you.&nbsp; A young man, in the prime of his life, being dragged down by a job that, as good as it my be, is not good for you.&nbsp; You are going to kill yourself if you keep doing this, and quite frankly I'm surprised that that you have done it for as long as you have."  &nbsp;  (i didn't want this sympathy, yet without even trying, i got it anyway)  &nbsp;  This was the first time that an outsider, a stranger rather, has said this to me.&nbsp; Obviously, I know this job isn't the 'best' thing for my mental and physical well being.&nbsp; But I do enjoy it.&nbsp; Not to many jobs can I make as much as I am while only working 5 hours a day.&nbsp; Ups &amp; downs aside, that's the average, 5 hours a day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My eyes wandered as I tried to come up with a response.&nbsp;&nbsp; I barely eeked out a syllable when she said "I can't help but feel sorry for you.&nbsp; I've seen a lot from life and the world.&nbsp; I'm sure you're seeing a lot of the world right now, but you aren't seeing what you want to see, just what you've always thought you wanted to see.&nbsp; I hope you wake up one day and realize that and can live the life that you want"  &nbsp;  and she was right  &nbsp;  This city isn't any different than any other city.&nbsp; Bigger buildings, stores under a different name.&nbsp; But it's the same thing week after week.&nbsp; The same hotels, the same track housing, the same strip malls, the same strangely familiar faces.&nbsp; I'm seeing the world, but it's not what I want to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come home to my house everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to see the same old corner store everyday.&nbsp; I want to see faces I recognize.&nbsp; Is this the lifestyle I want to be living?&nbsp; Living out of a suitcase, a different town every week with the only saving grace to help me fall asleep at night being the bottom of a bottle?  &nbsp;  yet here I sit, 5 days now  &nbsp;  ...nor any drop to drink.

      Chicago area all week.  Central/Northern Illisnoi week after that.  Western Illionois this weekend.  I won't be home till the 23rd  I'll update when I can.  And in the morning, while I'm on a plane to Chicago, my bank will recieve a payment for my car.  The last in a line over 2 years and 9 months (3 months early).  3 years since I wrapped that wonderful chariot around a tree.  Finally I can stop paying for it  but I still think that tree should have done me in.    I find myself wondering at night if it did.  Did I die that day?  And part of me believes I did.  Becasue this world has never been the same since.   Time to sleep and dream a little dream.........

      Wednesday night I found myself sitting in sheriffs Bar & Grill in Harrisonville Missurah.  I had just gotten off a 3 1/2 hour drive from Kirksville and the buy one get one free screamed my name.    Mr Beam and I were mildly entertained by drunken country karaoke and the fact that everyone in the place seemed to know eachother, have dated eachother, and some even had kids with the other a few years ago.  Literally, everybody knew everybody... and drama was the name of the game they all played.  And holy shit could they play it annoyingly well.  Luckily Mr. Beam was keeping me company.  "Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before" a small, almost child-like voice said over my shoulder.  I turned around and sitting next to me was about a slender 5 foot 5 brunette, with a nice smile (surprisingly).  At first glance I thought she had a good tan but then realized that it was just an ass load of freckles.  Freckled-face Maria is how I remembered her name.  "No, my first time here" I replied, feigning just enough interest.  "From around here?" (I get this one a lot)  "fortunately no, I'm from upstate NY" (don't ask about the big apple, I'm 600 miles from there and I hate the place.  Don't mention it, don't mention it, don't mention it...)  "Oh neat, I've been up to New York City once, that was wild"  I finished my drink and threw my free-drink chip on the bar, I figure if I have to endure it, then I'm at least gonna be numb.  "Yea, it's allright"  We make chit-chat for another 10 minutes or so when she tells me she wants me to meet her friend.  My mind perks up a little bit at the possible outcomes of 'meeting her friend', the forefront thought being wild hot steamy threesome sexy sex.  Her friend walked over and introduces herself as, I think it was Amy, but I do not really remember.    We all make small talk for a little bit when I asked how they met eachother.  "Oh" Freckled-face Maria began, "WE grew up together, since our parents lived in the same house"  My jaw drops as I ponder if I have just accidently stumbled into some incest thing.  "Sisters?" I ask slowly, almost inaudible.  "No no!" The other said laughing, "We're cousins! Hee hee"  It was at this moment that I had to muster every last bit of strength not to bust out laughing.  I thought I was joking when I said picking up two cousins, I never actually wanted it.  Dammit dammit dammit.  Always stupid stuff.  Why can't it be my island?  Oh no, that'd be too damn cool.  Instead it's inbred cousins.  Go me

      I looked down at the earth from 2,500 feet.  Small, but still definable.  Beutiful.  I half-jokingly asked the pilot if I could take the controls.  He asked me if I had ever flown before, to that I asked if the F-14 simulator game in the arcade counted.  He said it did, told me to grabe the joystick, and he let go.  I'm flying.  I'm actually flying   This was midday yesterday, Thursday in Harrisonville Missourah.  I was up there to get arial footage of the town, and next thing I knew one of my wildest dreams had come true.  It was euphoric.  It was glorious.  It was somehting that I will remember until the day I die (i hope).  The footage came out like crap and I don't care.

      This morning a mild earthquake rocked my world.  My mother has left for California, driving across country with my sister and nephews.  The next time I will see her will be in November, hopefully.  Fat mans flyin solo.  Speaking of which, I missed my flight out this morning.  This is the second time I've missed a flight.  I'm now planned to leave Rochester at 11:15.  Only 5 hours behind schedual.    And then the occasional aftershock.  My destination; the oh so lovely state of Missourah.  My goal?  TO videotape the living shit out of 4 little po-dunk towns that have at best, 800 people.  If I'm really lucky, maybe I'll score with two cousins.  Whoo-hoo!!    I'm goin to Kansis City... Kansis city hear I come.

      Driving through the farmlands of Illinois along State Highway one, I see fireworks going off in the distance.  It was a Wednesday, just after 9 pm.  A little ball of red, followed by white, and sporadically you would get a design done right.    There's an occasional smattering of a town here and there, but for the most part, farm country.   A little hint of green sparkles were barely glimsped through passing leaves.  I wonder what it's like for them.  These faces in the crowd I see every day.  Their day-in-day-out.  I wonder who they go home to at night.  I wonder if they've done something illegal.  I wonder if they're cheating on their spouses.  I wonder if they even notice I'm here.  A light pole flashes by and I wonder whose cross that is draped against the guard rail.  A streak of fire catches my eye just in time to explode into red white & blue attempted concentric circles that looked like the Olympic rings on an acid trip.  The last light pole passes by and I am once again enveloped in the darkness.  The fireworks stop, and the trail from my cigarette in the reflection of the front window catches my eye and then I see a little neon-green blink.  blink blink blink  I slow it down to 35.    Thousands of them, like twinkling stars all around me causing my eyes to just dart back and forth.  I pull the car over and step outside.  Fire-Flys.  Everywhere the eye could see, a little blink.  Thousands of them surround me, shooting from every direction to every other direction.  It was so disorienting I started getting the spins.  I closed my eyes and the wind picked up and brought with it that smell of prevailing. Like the lay over is almost over.  I got to my hotel at 10:30 and for the first time in weeks I slept soundly, and did not curse the morning.  Happy 4th folks.

      I'm somewhere that is oddly familiar too me. It feel like I'm walking through a dream- a place that is so familiar, yet so distantly obscure I can't make it out. Waking up in my own bed on a Tuesday is something I'm not used too. My fan. My dresser. My bare and cracked walls. My gold-glittered ceiling tiles. My comforter. my bed. No heavy auto-locking doors slamming behind me. No "Have a good day" as I walk out the door. Instead of parking lot, I see a field. Instead of endless traffic, I get a 35 MPH cruise to the office.  These are the days I swore I would never take for granted... the days I actually get to spend in Rochester. The days I actually get to remember why I like living here. Driving backroads instead of the highway. Looking at the world around me instead of just wandering through it.  I'm home all week. I have a vacation next week. There's talk of me working in the office the week after my vacation. 3 weeks at home?  I haven't had this much time off the road for 2 years.  Even the Christmas holiday I only got a week.  3 f'in weeks!  I'm gonna go stir crazy and i'm gonna love every minute of it!

      I'm not a big fan of airports. Stuffy, loud, obnoxious, and most of all crowded. On any given week I'm hauling around 95-100 pounds of equipment and clothes broken down like this; 25 lbs for my camera/brief case hanging off my left side, draped around my right shoulder. 30 lbs of lighting equipment in a long hard case (about 3 1/2-4ft) that hangs off my right side, draped across my left shoulder. Then the suitcase, weighing in on average 45-50 lbs, that I carry behind me alternating between my left and right hands, since the arms get weak VERY quickly with everything resting on the shoulders.  Now, try doing this without the use of the right arm or shoulder. This was not an easy feat. My camera case I cannot put over my right shoulder because it hurts like shit. The light-kit I cannot put over my left shoulder because it bangs into my elbow in the sling. I had thought that a sky-cap would see my struggling and offer a hand, they didn't. I had hoped that a good Samaritan would come up and carry ANYTHING for me, but none came. Lefty was stuck fending for himself in the desolate world of BWI. I looked everywhere for a luggage cart but they were all out- this has been the first time that I have seen ALL of them sold out. Figures it would be today- when I need one. After some clever duck-taping work, I thanked the construction crews that had obliged my request for said tape and I ventured off to the shuttle bus to the rental car facility.  I stood there at the doors to the bus, the driver looking at me and I him. He was giving me that 'can I help you?' look, and I was giving him that 'my arm is in a sling you fat bastard so get out of your seat and get my shit on your bus' look. Eventually he picked up on it and put my luggage on the bus. The shuttle bus sucks, the people smell, there's no AC and these drivers think they are Mario Andredi on coke. We reached the rental facility, another person, complete stranger, was kind enough to help me with my bags, I thanked them very much, explained how hard it had been to find any help. He nodded, said it was nothing and went on his way, as did I.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I would have to fight with Dollar to get my rental car. To them, somehow having my arm in a sling makes me ineligible to drive a car. Like I NEED two hands to drive- most of the time I drive with my knees anyway so if I loose a leg, then they can worry. I fought with them for 40 minutes, talking to managers, regional managers, facility managers, ass managers and even a midget. No, there really wasn't a midget, but it fit so well there. Finally, after ranting something about the Equal Opportunity Act, and Rights of Disabled people (and surprisingly sounding like I knew what I was talking about) they caved in and gave me my car- a Chrysler Sebring, an allright car if you're a hunchback or under 5 feet tall. For a guy in a sling, it's not easy to get in or out of. But I'd fought enough pointless battles for the day, I just wanted to get to my hotel take some meds and call it a day.  Living without this arm has been an interesting experience. I can't smoke and drive at the same time. I can take an isle seat on the plane without complaining. I can't scratch the right side of my face on impulse. I can get clients to carry my shit for me. I can't put things in any of my right pockets. I can look at the world and smile knowing I've lived like this once, and hopefully only once.

      I sit here typing with one hand. This isn't easy since I have one of those split keyboards. Nevertheless it's entertaining me- something new.   urlLink A week and a half ago  I was devoid of life. Empty. Well, running on empty anyway. I needed something to jumstart me again, something to breathe life into me again. Dislocating my shoulder has certainly provided just that.....  These were the first ten seconds after the fall (keep in mind I"m not indicating my head movements, however I started looking straight up, at the end I was looking sideways):       light i see light again this is good this is right light is good i shouldn't be dead I hope i'm not dead, i was hoping to get drunk tonight. light what is this light what's here clouds is that a cloud? it is, lots of em they're awfully fluffy hey, a tree why's it look weird? Oh, it's sideways WHy am I laying down? Why is my mouth dirty? what's this cloud of smoke?   It's not fluffy like the other ones   This can't be good   It's brown and darker   dark?   oh my god, was that the end? It couldn't' be,       my ..............    .............my shoulder hurts!   I feel pain I must be alive         The following ten minutes comprised of my laying there smoking three cigarettes and cursing the fact that I can't walk.  The following 60 hours have provided enough time to realize- that fall should have done me in. That was my second chance to get out- yet I kept myself here for 'something'. I can only say that 'something' is to 'feel alive'.  And i am     but I know I will die again

      I sat there gazing at a whole lot of hazy nothing. 3 hour hike up a mountain, to bask in the glorious haze. I didn't mind so much, since I was amazed that I was there in the first place. I rested for about half an hour before I started down. Had I known that it was going to be the last time for a month that my arm wasn't gonna be in a sling, I might have made it 40 min.  I came to a spot in the trail that dropped off about 4 feet. Loose gravel and stones, but nothing (I thought) I couldn't handle. I grabbed a near-by branch for support and reached my foot over the edge. Unfortunately my foot kept going- loose stone doesn't make a good anchor point. My foot, leg, and body, all at once, began to fall. My first thought was- 'good thing I'm holding onto this branch'. My second thought was 'fuck that hurts' as I dislocate my right shoulder.  Most folks can go a week hiking with only a few minor bruises. I go 5 hours and dislocate an arm. It wouldn't have been that bad, except I still had an hour hike to just get to my car- the nearest hospital? Dammed if I know.  I don't remember much of the hike after that. Carrying a day-pack on a dislocated shoulder isn't something I'm used to, nor the accompanying pain. I don't remember calling my doctor or driving to the hospital. I do remember the lovely sound it made when the Doctor popped it back in place. I wish I could get a recording of that... that... Squishy crunch.  So, for about a month I have to keep my arm in a sling, physical therapy after that. Is the job worth this? Loosing the use of my right arm for the sake of a pay check. What have I allowed myself to become?  I could remember days I took off because my foot hurt- now I don't even take a day off when I dislocate a shoulder.  I guess this is growing up.            and I had promised myself I would never grow up

       I feel like I'm dreaming. That as I look down at the highways and specs of towns, that this isn't really happening. I'm not sitting on this plane right now. I'm actually curled up in a ball under my blankets blissfully dreaming.
