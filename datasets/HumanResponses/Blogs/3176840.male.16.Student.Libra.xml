       i have finally finished my webpage last night. i was up 'til 2 in the morning but i didn't mind that because i have finally finished my work and uploaded it in geocities. the address of my webpage is the same, i didn't use a new hosting site or account because i want it to be accessible and i also wan to maintain my webapge. last night when i was finishing my webpage, i downloaded this song enititled 'i swear' by the trio korean group, 'S'. i really like this song. i have watched the mv of the song last year, and i liked it at once because of its tune. i have watched it many times since then because during those times S was very popular in korea so their songs and videos are in demand. i haven't got any chance to download the song during those times because i don't know where to download it. i just started downloading korean songs this summer. so when i have seen the mv of that song again and downloading is now accesible, i have already forgotten the title of the song. so, i posted some messages in different forums assuming that someone could help me remember the title of the song. i was blessed because the people in that forum are very kind and very helpful. that's why i have managed to remember the title. after knowing its title i readily went to another forum to look for the song and luckily i have downloaded the right song. i have downloaded the full song when i have already finished my webpage. i listen to the song first before i went to bed. and the joy that the song brought me after listening to it made me sleep at once when i lie into bed. and it brought me a peace of mind... hehehe...

       i was changing the channel to look for some cool shows 'til i got to channel 28, national geographic channel. i got interested to the show about dust storms so i watched it. i found out that dust stroms are natural catastrophes caused by the dusts in the deserts that are being carried by strong winds. though it forms in the desert, it still reaches the urban areas or cities. the massive dust storm affects everything it will cause damage by the dust it carries causing some desctructions to the surroundings and health of the people and animals. the dusts carry microorganisms and viruses dangerous to the health of the people. it causes some ailments like asthmas. the whole world experience this massive storms. in asia, china, japan and south korea are most likely affected by the dust storm. in china, 33% of its total land area is composed of desert that's why the country itself and its neighboring countries experience dust storms. the dusts in the chinese deserts also reaches the arctic. in africa, the largest desert is to be found, the sahara desert. the dusts in the saharan desert does not affect only the places near to it but also in europe. the dusts that are carried by winds reaches the european continent causing much damage. in 2001, britain experinced the most greatest problem caused by the dust storm in their farm industry. the livestock affected by the dust storm had to be slaughtered. it cost 6 billion pounds. in america, they also experience the tremendous storm. they are worried for some places like las vegas because it is surrounded by a desert. the desert is capable to drown the whole of las vegas with its dusts. las vegas is one of the growing cities in america. the growth of the place is reaching the desert so the authorities are taking some precautions to lessen the danger that dust storms may cause. one of the precautions they did was to wet the dry desert where the constructions were taking place. the hottest place in earth is also found in america, the death valley. the temperature there reaches 57 degrees centigrade. the hottest temperature there takes place during the month of july. a person can die there by dehydration. they say a person can only last there for 4 hours if he does not drink water because the water in the body easily dries. a person once their took a journey but he did not make it back because of dehydration and his blood thickens so the heart could not easily pump blood to the brain. the person's original weight was 165 kg, but when they took the dead body it only weighed 90 kg. some scientists took some observations about the behavior of a "dust devil" because they want to know why if this dust devil triggers a dust storm. but they have no idea if it really does. based on their observations, a dust devil is formed in a rocky surface. the heat of the sun makes surface warm. then the wind carries the dust in between the rocks. the forming dust devil continues to grow in size by sucking more dusts in between of the rocks like a vacuum. a dust devil reaches the height of a two-storey building. but still, the scientists have no idea if dust devils triggers dust storms. so the question still remains,  do dust devils trigger dust storms ?  -from the scientific mind of jasr =)

       wow! i can't believe i have my own of this thing or let's say an online diary or blog..... hehehe. maybe i was engaged to create my own online diary beacuse i became interested of  reading my friends and classmate's blog. well, i guess having this kind of thing is good because we can have something to write about our personal daily experiences, thoughts, feelings, and secrets..... hehehe. actually, i'm not super good at writing but since this is my personal online diary, it's ok to not be perfect (especially in grammar.... hehehe). anyways, it's a means of expressing what's within us so it's ok to be ourselves and to be comfortable at our skills. i guess i have said too much about having a blog. so here's my first official post......  i started my day waking up at 11:30 in the morning. i got up late today because i stayed 'til 2 in the morning doing my webage. sadly, i haven't finished it yet but i'm hoping to finish it soon. i have been wanting to have my own webpage before but i have no idea of how to do it. i'm so much happy now that i know how to because we had a html class in our computer education when i was in 4th year hs..... so, i spent my afternoon in front of the computer still doing  my webpage but sadly, it's still not yet finished. after that, i log-on to the internet to check my e-mail but unluckily, i haven't got any e-mails from my friends or classmates..... so sad. then after checking my e-mail, i log-in at tsinoy.com, one of the coolest forum i have ever been too. i'm really addicted to this forum lately. i would not pass a day not posting a message since the day i first log-in there. the people there are very kind and crazy about their favorites..... hehehe. right now im active at TVXQ!, SHOWKING M & SHOWMUSIC TANK, POPS IN SEOUL, SHOWBIZ EXTRA forums and other korean artists & shows forum. i want to post more messages but i have no more time because it's my sister's turn using the computer..... i really hope to have my own computer so that i can have all the time i want..... hehehe..... i don't go out of the house unless we're going to the mall, church or relatives, meeting friends or going to school.....so, to relieve my boredom and to save some precious moments, i watch tv, clean the house or read a book (kapag sinisipag ako....) or hook up on the internet to chat or post some messages..... i took a bath after then..... then watched some of my fav shows in disney channel, even stevens & that's so raven..... at night i watched star circle quest & marina, few of my favorite shows in abs-cbn..... then we ate dinner..... and right now, i'm writing my first post in my own online diary...... so that's what happened me this day.  - my usual habits..... by jasr =)

       last thursday, i went to ust to get my uniforms. i was accompanied by yumi, ana francezca and arive. we met at the church patio (as usual) around 8am and i was the last to arrive. we left readily after i came. we went to apex and rith there, we took a fx going to taft. we ride a jeepney after we came going to espana. we arrived safely at ust around 9:30 am. me & yumi together w/ ana and arvie went to the gym to get our pe uniforms. a very long line appeared when we arrived there. we have no choice so we also lined up. it didn't took me hours to get my uniform. i was disgruntled upon seeing my pe uniform. the design kinda irritated me because the print took almost the front area of the shirt. the shirt was color yellow by the way, and the design of the print was the thomasian buildings and the face of a tiger at the center covering up most of the design. the shorts was black and the fabric waskinda thick w/c i found very uncomfortable when i imagined myself wearing it on the sunny afternoon. yumi's uniform was kinda more likable to me because it just a plain yellow t-shirt and black jogging pants. we went afterwards to the main building to get my school uniform. i got my uniform in no time when i arrived at the room where it was delivered because only few people was there. we left ust after accomplishing our task. went to sm manila to have our lunch. we ate at dunkin' doughnuts. we didn't ate doughnuts though, the three of us (me, yumi & arive) have ham & cheese while ana was the only one who stick eating doughnuts. we left for home after. it was raining hard when were on our way home. we're lucky that we're already inside the jeepney when it started raining. the 4 of us were laughing inside the jeepney because we got wet inside. ana brought out her umbrella and handed it to arvie and arvie opened it inside to prevent us from getting wet. by the way we we're seated on the "bukana of the jeep" (i don't know how i'm gong to say it in english but the idea is there) to make the picture clearer. we arrived in pateros around 2 in the afternoon. i ended up in bed when i arrived home beacause i was very very tired.

       i have sauccessfully burn again another cd on my own. it includes 9 kpop songs that are my all time favorite; atlantis princess-boa, i swear-s, without your love-jtl, hug-dbsg, music-bada, what is love-dana, cry-1tym, disco king-koyote & monologue-buzz. i'm really addicted to these songs. it took me almost a month to dowload these songs in various korean sites. and i'm very thankful that i've succeeded. i'm still tracking down some songs that i haven't found yet and burn it again on a cd.

       how am i feeling?   FEELING GOOD!!! NEVER BEEN BETTER!!!  - oh i'm so glad because everything is back to normal. it was just 15 mins ago when i wrote how i feel towards my friend and the situation we've got into but now i can't compare the happiness that i'm feeling because we're ok now. i didn't know that she was online all the time i was writing on how i feel. she pm so that's how i figured out that she was online. i was shocked that she pm me w/ a msg that seems nothing is wrong between us. i told her that i was really sorry about and she told me that everything was ok. that was the time that i really got off with the uncertain feeling. then i told her that if she reads the blog that i wrote, just regard it since everything was ok between us. then we chatted about it and we used the cry smiley as if we're crying!!! wahahaha!!! i really feel good now!!! thank god!!! i really couldn't affor to loose a very special friend...    THE WORST FEELING EVER...  - i don't know how to feel toward this friend of mine. should i also be mad or just be patient and wait for the time to calm her hatred or unpleasant feeling to me.? i think this friend of mine is mad at me because of an unpleasant situation that has happened 2 days ago. i really didn't mean it to happen. the problem was already solved because the thing that i ACCIDENTALLY and DIDN'T mean to DELETE was finally retrieved back because i really did all i can to make this friend happy. i even called at their house to say that it was already back but still i feel that this friend of mine is still not in the mood confronting me. actually i think this friend is "making iwas" to me because after logging in at ym, this friend readily logged-off that made me feel that this friend doesn't want to chat w/ me even though i was in invisible mode. to tell the truth and no offense i really don't like very sensitive people (i'm not saying that this friend im referring to is a sensitive person. i just want to say how i feel about a sensitive kind of person...) because they get easily upset in an unwanted situation. to tell frankly, i'm also a sensitive person because like what i said, i easily get upset in an UNWANTED SITUATION but i'm getting over w/ it once i feel bad in a situation that i don't like to be involved. *sighs..... i really hope that everything will be back to normal because i love this friend of mine and one of my closest.

       i've been waiting for this day to come... to rain all day... actually it really didn't rain all day. it just started raining in the afternoon. the weather suddenly changes these past days. when you wake up, the heat of the sun is almost suffocating but when it rained you can't even stand to take a bath without a hot water. but when i took a bath this afternoon i didn't bother to have a hot water because i really like to refresh my self with the cold water. it rained for almost the rest of the afternoon making the temperature cooler than the usual. i watch the boxing match between pacqiao and marquez in our room because i could stay now long enough upstairs because during these past sunny days i'm almost dying because of the tremendous heat in our room during afternoons. i'm not really an avid watcher of boxing but i got interested to watch this match beacuse it's a champinoship fight between my country and mexico. manny pacquio, as all we know is a filipino and got famous since he defeated guerrero (i don't know if i spelled it correctly) also in a boxing match few months ago and his opponent, juan miguel marquez came from mexico. they both are fighting for the championship (i forgot what championship it is). they both have managed to reach the 12th round. the result of the fight based on the scores of the judges came to a tie. i was a bit happy that they are tie, no winner and no loser. i think, pacqiao should be the winner not because he's my fellowman but i saw how he did his best to win th fight. i went downstairs after watching the match. i log on to the internet to check my e-mail and as usual post some messages in tsinoy forum. i downloaded the music video of 'disco king' by koyote. i really love this kpop song. it makes me dance whenever i hear or watch the video of this song. after i have finished downloading, i went upstairs again to watch tv. that's all about me for today! anyeong!

       it's kinda late to update this to my blog because my mom's 46th b-day was 2 days ago. anyways, here's what happened to me on that day. i woke up late again. i think it was 1 in the afternoon. my body feels heavy and some parts of my body is aching that's why i haven't got up when i woke up about 10 in the morning. i slept again and when i checked the time in my cell phone, it was already 1 pm. i quickly get out of bed because i don't want to spend the rest of the afternoon in bed. i go downstairs afterwards. i went first to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. when i got out of the bathroom, i greeted my mom happy b-day. i didn't hug or kiss her but it doesn't mean that i don't love her or care for. she knew that i'm not an emotional person. she know that i keep my feelings inside my self regarding my feelings for them. i do love them but i don't show them my affection since i became a teen-ager. i know i will say to my self in the future that i should've shown them my affection before it's too late. but i know what i'm doing and i know that they understand me. i know that being a good child to them means affection to them so as much as possible i want to be a good achild even though sometimes i'm moody. i spend the rest of the afternoon in our room cleaning. i separated the things that i'm still and gonna use and the things that i used when i was in high school. i don't want to throw them away because i might use them in college. so i put them away in the storage room. i went downstairs after cleaning. i ate lunch though it's already 4 in the afternoon. i log in to the internet to check my e-mail and to post some messages at tsinoy forum. i took a bath and went upstairs after then. i was watching star circle quest when my brother went up and told me that we're gonna eat outside because it's our mother's b-day. we went to the fort and ate at pancake house. i didn't like that much the food that i ordered. it was roast chicken, tacos and macaroni salad. i didn't like the taste of the chicken and its sauce. and the thing that i didn't like most about is that the underneath the chicken was a bread. the bread doesn't tastes good because of the sauce. it's kinda soggy. the tacos and the macaroni is quite good. then i refreshed my self with iced tea, my favorite refreshment. after eating, we decided to go to star bucks to buy some frappuccino. that's the only thing that i drink their because i'm not used to drinking hot coffee. i didn't go inside to buy. my 2 sisters accompanied my father & mother instead. i sit outside while waiting for them. my brother accompanied me. he said to me that katya santos was at the other group of chairs. i look to where he is pointing out and i saw her. she's prettier and sexier in person than in tv. my father & mother along with my 2 sisters came out and said that jennifer sevilla was inside but i didn't went inside to look at her. we decided to drink the frappuccino inside the car so we went off afterwards. well, that's it for one of the most special day in my life.

       two nights ago, i had the cutest and dream ever. i was with aaron, one of the finalists of star circle kid quest. i really can't remember how we met but all i know is that he was with me in our house. we were at the right side of our house, a narrow alley leading to my grandma's sister's house and my mom's cousin's house. me and aaron was there and my father suddenly walk behind us and he told to aaron to get a plastic lid. i don't know what's the plastic lid for but we found a lid of a cheese planters. aaron said to me that the lid we found was a little wide but i said to him that it was ok. we went to after my dad to bring him the lid that we found. my father was heading to the pateros municipal hall. so, i said to the tricyle driver to bring us to the to the municipal hall. there was a little traffic so me and aaron got to have some time to talk. he's really cute. he was as cute as he was on tv. i was kinda happy at that moment because i'm with my favorite star circle kid questor. i like him the most because he's so cute and adorable. i hope that he would enter the magic circle of 5. back to my story, as we head to the hall, i noticed people acting strange. some people were like on a riot, others acting like a zombie!????? what is that!!!????? i also asked my self why from the moment i woke up.... by the way, that's the end of my dream because i suddenly woke up...... woaaaaaahhhhhh..... that's really a strange but cute dream. i'll never forget that.
