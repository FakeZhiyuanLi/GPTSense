      I'm going to go out on a limb with this one, but I would put forward the idea that, just as Spider-Man was a reflection of America's spirit immediately post-9/11, Spider-Man 2 serves as a pretty good reflection of the national mood a few years further on. To explain:  The theme of the first film was outright heroism. Oh, to be sure, it was repeatedly pointed out that there are certain prices to pay; "with great power comes great responsibility" and so forth. But the essential  nobility  of it, the worthiness and worthwhileness of Peter's choice to become a superhero was never really questioned.  The second film  does  question those assumptions. We're asked to consider whether running around acting as a hero might be futile at best, and actually harmful at worst. Many scenes play out as darker echoes of the first film; Peter rescues a child from a burning building (without using his powers, even) and returns her to her grateful parents. Yet he learns later that, unbeknownst to him, another man burned to death a few floors further up. It becomes increasingly clear to him that he cannot hope to save everyone.  There's another section of the film where Peter, for a while, rejects herodom entirely. Much like the first film, he witnesses a robbery and chooses not to intervene. And this time, no tragedy results. The world keeps on spinning. We are asked to consider whether an opportunity to act heroically requires us to do so, or merely gives us the option.  Yet another scene depicts an exhausted Spider-Man, having just stopped a runaway train, about to fall into the harbor below. He is caught by the passengers, who pass him along like honorary pallbearers, and later, choose not to reveal his identity. I swear I heard someone in the theatre shout, "Go New York!". Trite, perhaps, but also a valid and oft overlooked point: under the right conditions, mobs of people can act with incredible nobility instead of ignorance and hate. New York really did remind the world of that, and though the first film gave short shrift to the heroism of the ordinary individual, the second reminds us of it often.  The film's strongest argument in favor of the hero comes from Aunt May (speaking, I maintain, the words of Stan Lee). Interestingly, she says very little about the things Spider-Man has actually done. Rather, she's most concerned with the way in which he has inspired others, like their young neighbor boy. This, she claims, is Spider-Man's greatest importance. The film could even be commenting upon itself: do all the whiz-bang action sequences pale into insignificance besides the ideals, and the nature of humanity itself, that the film projects?  The point of all this is that I think Spider-Man 2 will resonate strongly with a nation that has, perhaps, become a bit weary with playing the hero. We've become very aware, not only of the responsibilities that come with the role, but of all the violence and pain and missed opportunities and unintended consequences that come with it. That's not to say (and the film doesn't say) that it's not worth it to be a hero; rather, it's that you must think  very  carefully about what you are doing, how you are doing it, and most importantly, why.  It's quite clear at the end that Peter is acting for just as many selfish motives as selfless ones. This does not invalidate his actions; but when he tries to forget the personal side, his powers seem to vanish. I think that there might be a little lesson there for all of us.

      A quick post before bed, on my last half-hour of battery life. What possessed me to bring my laptop to KC but not an adapter?  Spider-Man 2 is, without question, far superior to its predecessor, which was itself a pretty good film. Without going into spoilers, it has a great deal more humor, and does a better job of remembering that it's a comic book. It also seems much longer than its 2:15 running time, not in a is-this-over-yet? way, but in a wow-there's-a-lot-of-plot-here sort of way.  Let me go out on a limb and say that the female characters (Mary-Jane and Aunt May) are the most interesting in the film. While all the men around them seem to be doing and thinking and feeling whatever the plot requires them to, these woman seem like fully realized human beings. That's very important even (especially?) in comic books, as their writers have never forgotten. Aunt May, in particular, seems to be speaking words directly from Stan Lee's mouth. The philosophy behind his characters and his writing becomes crystal clear. (Look for his quick cameo in a scene involving Aunt May.)  Oh, yes, and my interview today! Went quite well, I think, despite my being rather sleep deprived. Talked to three people from the company; one was definitely positive, one probably was but hard to say, and one was totally unreadable. One way or another they say they'll get back to me within two weeks or so. Don't expect me to announce it here immediately - I may, by then, have some other offers to consider - but the signs are positive, at least.

      Posting from my hotel room in Kansas City. Ethernet ports in every room. What a wonderful world we live in, that this is becoming a semi-standard feature. Love the booby-traps though. Have a complimentary bottle of water! PS: We'll charge $4.00 to your bill if you do...  Cerner is literally wining and dining us - dinner was at a really, really nice restaurant here on the plaza. Perhaps I misevaluated who needs who more; they're really going out of their way to convince me that it's a nice place to work and nice city in which to live. When, in reality, if I didn't think so, I never would have applied in the first place. Ah well. Real interviews are tomorrow noon, and I will in fact be going to see Spider-Man 2 at midnight, and head home Wednesday instead.  More  urlLink decisions from the Supreme Court  today, and unlike last week, these are really cool. Holding people indefinitely without trial? BAH! Take that, Bush. Glad to see the Supremes occasionally remember that we do have a few bedrock legal principles in this country.

      Posting this from Rusty's apartment down in Kansas City. Not a particularly long drive, but it kinda sucks when the cruise control on your car doesn't work. Oh well. Fittingly, he wasn't here when I got here - had to wait for him to clean out a poker tournament. And when he got here, he offered me a beer. Some things never change. :)  Looks like I'm finally about to win our online  urlLink Citadels  game. About time, to. I don't tend to win very much, and the last few summers I've tended to lose HARD. Just lucky I guess.  Happiness is showing up at a college dorm room with beer... and cookies.  Interviewing starts tomorrow. Wish me luck. I might stick around afterwards on Tuesday evening to go see Spider-Man 2 at midnight, tickets permitting. Review here if I do.

      More watching romantic films alone in the wee hours of the night. "Amelie" this time. One of the best films ever made, in my opinion. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't like it, so endlessly imaginative and charming. See it if you haven't. It also falls alongside "Magnolia" for films with the following message: not all of life's little chances and coincidences are as random as they seem; and even if they are, sheer chance is far more powerful than all of our plans put together. What Man proposes, God disposes...  A mystery: the film's literal title is "The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain", but beneath it, the English subtitles proudly proclaim, "Amelie from Montmartre". That's the district of Paris where the film is set, and apparently the title used for it at certain festivals and such. But, I can't imagine it being particularly evocative for anyone outside France. Curious.  Two of my better friends broke up, then reconciled, within the past twenty-four hours. Am I the only person who's never been through that particular dance in a relationship? I'm never sure how to treat such people; congratulate them for getting it over with? Console them and encourage them to get back together? Be nice? Be honest? It'd almost be better if people didn't tell me about these things until a week later.  Shareholders' meeting tomorrow, which probably means I have to look decent at work for once. Then again, perhaps the investors assume (as I sometimes do) that the shabbier an engineer looks, the more brilliant he is. Heh. I wish.  I've started telling a few people about this thing. Hello, if it's you.  "Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's."

        ceilidh : An Irish or Scottish social gathering with traditional music, dancing, and storytelling.   Unbelievably enough, it's pronounced "kay-lee", and from it is derived the semi-popular name for girls.  In other news, men's dress shoes are horribly expensive, for reasons that are entirely beyond me. Electric shavers, on the other hand, are good, no matter what people might say. Ten page management papers are bad; fifteen page quantitative methods papers are worse. Shareholder meetings are good, but streaming QuickTime is bad. Beer cheese soup is very, very, very good, and if it were legal in this state, I'd ask it to marry me.  That is all.

      There were a number of  urlLink interesting decisions  handed down by the  urlLink Supreme Court  today. The scariest to me is the one that says you're required to give your name and identification to a police officer or be arrested, regardless of whether you've done anything wrong, regardless of whether he even has reason to think you have. Extremely icky. But then again, I'm a bit of a constitutional law wonk, so maybe my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.  Getting a haircut can be a rather painful experience when your scalp is sunburned.  Still prepping for that job interview next week: getting my suit dry-cleaned, loafers polished, and realizing that I no longer have a decent pair of Oxfords and need a new one. Maybe I can find dress shoes that don't suck this time.  Speaking of job interviews  and  scary legalities, the following appears at the top of the forms I have to fill out for Cerner. All perfectly standard, I expect, but still:   I authorize Cerner Corporation (the "Company") and/ or its agents to procure and obtain a consumer report, including an investigative consumer report, pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act as part of its pre-employment selection process, or at other times during my employment if I am hired by the Company, and to make an investigation of my background, references, character, past or current employment, job performance, education, criminal and police records, general reputation, mode of living, credit worthiness, and to make other investigative checks, including those maintained by both public and private entities and public records, through data checks or personal interviews with those who may have knowledge concerning such information, for the purpose of confirming the information contained on my written or electronic application, Personal Data Sheet, resume, or other documentation and/or to obtain other information which may be material to my application for employment or continued employment with the Company.   Should I sign such a thing? Would you?

      Went to see the College World Series in Omaha last night with Wrenholt. Fullerton over South Carolina, 2-0. Pretty much a pitcher's duel, with only eight hits total between the two teams. I've been kinda surprised over the years how much I enjoy attending athletic events that I would have absolutely no interest in playing or watching on TV. Maybe it's the social aspect. Like going to a movie, except you're allowed to talk.  Speaking of which, also saw Prisoner of Azkaban for the second time. Caught a few details I missed the first time - like the spell Hermione uses to blast open Sirius's jail cell, "morsmordre", which is actually used in Book 4 to conjure the Dark Mark. Or the fact that Lupin, while not looking very much like our traditional werewolves, does look almost exactly like the illustrations that Snape displays for the class. I also stayed to watch the closing credits this time. There's no extra scene afterwards, as in the previous film, but they  are  a wonder to watch. Full of special effects nearly as elaborate as those in the film itself. Fun stuff.  Unfun stuff: the Second Quest of the original Legend of Zelda is just brutally difficult. I'd forgotten just how much so; I can't even manage to finish Level 4, and I'm almost ready to cheat or give up. Yikes. They definitely toned things down for the SNES generation onwards.

      Mike Wrenholt's birthday tonight. Stupid management test made me miss the burgers, but at least I think I aced it. Once I finally did get there, I mixed up a batch of radler, a German concoction I became quite fond of while I was studying there. Half wheat beer, half lemonade, it's really good stuff, particularly in the summer. Everyone else who tried it seemed to like it too.  Headed downtown to Bricktop after that, a bar I'd never been to before. I'd been told by reliable sources that it was "practically a gay bar anyway".  Now I see what they mean: besides the techno, dance floor, and actual gay men, there were lots of (IMO) straight men who dressed and acted as if they ought to be gay. Stupid cultural cross-pollenation. Stupid Queer Eye for the Straight Guy...  I did confirm an earlier observation, though, which is that techno tends to put me into an ultra-relaxed, almost sleepy state. Maybe that's supposed to be the intended effect - I'm thinking of trance here, although the music tonight wasn't. Nobody else seemed to be reacting that way, though. Wierdness.

      So,  urlLink The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures  for the GameCube kicks every conceivable variety of ass. I just got done with a six hour session with James, Sarah, and Kyros, follow-up to a ten hour session last weekend. And I still want to play more.  The game works like this: each of the four players controls a different Link. You travel through a series of very Zelda-like dungeons, eight worlds of three areas each. The gimmick is that you have to use GameBoy Advances to control the game. Most of the time, you're all on screen, but when you go into a house or cave, the display switches down to the GameBoy screen, so each player is potentially seeing something different. The four of you have to cooperate to solve various puzzles and defeat enemies. But, the designers also added "force", tiny gems that determine points at round's end, in order to encourage a bit of competitiveness as well.  If you're a fan of the Zelda series like I am, then there's an orgy of things to enjoy here. The story is from Oracle of Seasons/Ages, the world map is from Ocarina of Time, the dungeons resemble Link to the Past, and many of the bosses are taken from Wind Waker. It's like they threw everything great about Zelda into a pot, stirred, and got back something even better.  So yeah, it's a amazingly fun game, even if James is a  urlLink dirty, gem-guzzling whore . These are the sorts of things you just have to put up with in life.

      I had a telephone interview with  urlLink Cerner  today, the first (and so far only) company to show interest after my application blizzard a few weeks ago. Pretty standard stuff - expanding on my resume, some behavioral what-if questions, that sort of thing. I think it must have gone well, because they want me to come down to Kansas City in the near future to interview in person. Yay!

      So, the other night, I watched a movie I haven't watched in a long time: Ever After. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's a retelling of the Cinderella story with an only-slightly-modern flavor. Oh, and I watched it by myself. At first, I thought myself pretty pathetic, but then I changed my mind.  I like romances because they show people at their best, which appeals to my inner idealist. They show the world, to paraphrase Ayn Rand, not as it is but "as it might be and ought to be". They make me feel... confident, somehow. Reassured. That love is waiting for me somewhere in the future, that being in love is every bit as wonderful as I remember it, that every once in a while, we do live happily ever after.  By comparison, and most of my friends can't understand this, I  don't  particularly care for romantic comedies. There's nothing particularly funny about being in love. Oh, sure, it's  fun , but it's also (at the time, at least) the most important and serious thing in the world. Playing it for laughs somehow demeans the entire experience. For me, at least.  Romances I Dig: Amelie, Chasing Amy, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ever After, My Best Friend's Wedding, The Broken Hearts Club, The Princess Bride. Many of them don't have particularly happy endings, but they have something even more important: honesty and total sincerity. And lots of it.

      So, I finally broke down and made myself a weblog. As perhaps the only neo-luddite software engineer in existance, I seem to be the last one to jump on any given bandwagon. Would you believe that I don't even own a cellular phone? But this one I just couldn't ignore any longer.  More than that, though I've never kept a diary, I've always had long, literary rants pop into my head, on a variety of subjects, and usually late at night. Normally, I would simply IM them to my friends, but it's been happening later and later, so that nobody's awake by the time I need to talk. And if I wait until the next morning, it's all fallen apart.  So, here I am. This will be my official place to brain dump, when nowhere else will do. But I think I'll let it sit for a while, accumulate some content, before I start telling my friends. Otherwise, they'll expect me to have something clever to say every day...

      Had lunch with Ashley at Vincenzo's today; wisdom teeth aside, marriage seems to be agreeing with her. She showed me the pictures from the wedding, and I think I managed to be blinking in every last one. Oh well. The ones I'm in aren't the important ones anyway. I do believe she and I will be collaborating on a new project, though: keeping her husband from brewing biodiesel in the garage. Anything that requires collecting used oil from restaurants is just a bit too close to a Simpsons episode for his own good.   Looks like I'll spend a good chunk of the weekend hanging out with (among others) my ex's new boyfriend. Surprisingly, I find that I'm fine with that, and have been for some time now. When did I become so, well, mature? And rational? And sane? It's a very Tom Hanks sort of feeling to wake up one day and find that you can be big about things. Best guess: the years have taught me that friends are rarer and more important than lovers. Or as Mick Jagger might have said,  You can't always get what you want / But if you try sometimes, you might find / You get what you need...    At some point this weekend, I'm also going to try to see "The Village". I've got a huge fondness for atmospheric horror films, and it seems to fit the bill.

      I've probably mentioned it in person to most of my readers, but I did, in fact, accept a job as a software engineer with Cerner. I'll be starting September 20, which gives me a month after graduation to find an apartment and get moved, not to mention go to a few football games and exchange some tearful (really!) goodbyes with the various Kauffmanites. Come visit me in Kansas City, I'll be lonely...

      Tom Rice is back! We, the living, had to suffer through three months of total radio silence that began the moment he got to Arizona, General Dynamics, and Amy. I suppose I can't  entirely  blame him, but I might gently remind him that he does have other friends. :) Anyway, he says he's going to start keeping up his blog again (link at right), so keep an eye on it.  I do have to raise one bullshit flag, though: Tom claimed that he didn't have Internet at home all this time because he was lazy and didn't get around to it. Please. For a geek of our stature, that's like saying you forgot to eat or drink for a few months. At least come up with a believable excuse...  Justin Bechtel also made his trimphant return to the Internet this week. I'd like to think it's because he missed me, but the truth probably has more to do with his wife's two-week vacation (alone) to go visit her family, and him being bored out of his skull. I wonder what it's like to reach that point in your marriage where you realize that your social lives revolve almost entirely around one another, and that&nbsp;you haven't really been  alone  in years. It seems scary, yet somehow alluring.

      It occurred to me that I haven't said much in here yet that was overtly political. I guess I assumed that most of my friends are pretty familiar with my views already. But with the Democratic National Convention going on, and the silly season&nbsp;winding up, it's started to be on my mind. So here goes nothing...   "For every complex question, there is a simple answer, and it is wrong." -- Oscar Wilde. If anyone from the Kerry campaign is listening,&nbsp;it ought to be one of his slogans. I've seen him get a lot of flak for giving long, complex answers to questions. More power to him, I say. Anything like a honest answer to the sorts of questions we ask our politicians is  going  to be pretty complicated. I think it's mainly the (any-wing) media itself that comes down on him for this, because it makes their life difficult when you can't be easily reduced to sound bites. The only other possible the explanation is that the electorate is&nbsp;mostly idiots, and doesn't like it when the smart man uses big words, which I&nbsp;don't believe is the case.   I also get pretty testy whenever someone points out that Kerry has been on many sides of various issues during the course of his career. You know what? So have I. It's called learning. Show me a representative who's voted totally consistently, on every bill, on every issue, and I'll show you a representative who's never had a conscious thought in his life. If he can explain to me why he voted the way he did on any given question, then he has my full support. (All of this, of course, presumes that a given bill only encompasses a single goal which, guess what, is rarely the case.)   Is there really someone out there (cheap shot: other than George W. Bush) who believes that the world is a place of black and white and simple solutions? Please, tell me their address, that I might go and smack them over the head with the frying pan of moral complexity. It's sure as hell not the world that I live in. I don't want my president to be a man whose job it is to gloss over the messy details of messy situations. It's not good vs. evil or us vs. them, and it's entirely possible to be both with us and against us. Bring on the ambiguity, I say.   It has become increasingly clear to me over the years that a president's greatest influence, and greatest legacy, is the stamp they leave on our nation's culture. They set the tone for us all, for years at a time. I'm a bit of an idealist, I guess, but I need to vote for the candidate whose ideal country seems closest to my own. Because, in no small measure, they will push the country in that direction. In that light, for me, it's an almost laughably easy choice...   More than anything else, though, I fear the results if the popular vote and the electoral college go separate ways again. I think it would be disastrous, undermining the already shaky confidence of an apathetic populace, on both sides of the aisle. Nothing could be more poisonous for a democracy than the impression that your vote doesn't matter.   Random tidbit: rumor has it that the Arab network  urlLink Aljazeera  will be broadcasting more of the DNC than any of the American networks. Good for them. I daresay that the average Middle Eastern citizen has an even more urgent interest in the results of the election than we do. It's not life and death for us, but it might be for them.   He'll slay me for this, but I'm going to link to a few of my friend Derrick's  urlLink various   urlLink sketches . I think he's a really, really good artist, and that he should hear that from more people than just me.

      Spent the evening at  urlLink James Arthur Vineyards   &nbsp;with Whidden, Holley, and the Elder Holleys. &nbsp; I hadn't been there in a  long  time, back when it was little more than vines. They've come a long way since. Twenty-one different varieties of wine, sold all over the state, not to mention a very posh store and gorgeously landscaped grounds. Oh, and resident kittens too! If I ever managed to get a date, it would definitely be a place I would go.  Five bucks gets you sample glasses of six different wines; they've also got cheese, bread, chocolate, etc, and live music on the weekends. I think my favorite was the Edelweiss (also their biggest seller), with the Vignoles being a very close second. Both semi-sweets, even though I usually go for semi-dry. We also tried a bottle of the ice wine, which is extremely expensive, extremely sweet, extremely alcoholic, and extremely good.  What else did I do this weekend, anyway? Last night seems like last week. Oh, right: Animal House. I realized that my reaction to it is probably pretty common: if only college had actually been like that, and, college occasionally  was  like that. I mean, to me, everything that happens in the movie seems perfectly logical and straightforward. Kinda scary. Kinda cool.

      A nice evening at Ghettowood with Whidden and Holley and the Selleckites (Johnson and Stolee). Pizza, swimming, drinking, and Stargate. What more can a man ask for in life? Also, hot tubs  rock . I hadn't been in one in forever and had almost forgotten their orgasmic wonderfulness. Need to find an apartment complex that has one...   I found myself getting into that nice, relaxed, among-friends groove again, as discussed a while back. I know&nbsp;I must come off as recklessly blunt and honest sometimes, the things that come out of my mouth, but really, my guard doesn't go down all that often. Were I to go around saying the things that were really in my heart, there'd be far more compliments than the usual, sarcasm. But it turns out that the vast majority of my friends don't respond well at all to any sort of admiration or praise. A pity. By and large, I think they deserve it.   ...and just when my own life is going so well, reviewing other blogs I see that one of my best friends' life has just exploded into a million pieces. Time to go be a friend, I think.

      Out of the blue today, got an email from my very first ex, whom I hadn't seen or heard from in at least six years. Stranger still, instead of updates about life (or at least location), the bulk of the email is devoted to anime recommendations. I... well, I don't know what to think, I guess. But I did reply.  Theory: highly competitive people instinctively recognize and focus on their own kind. I won all the board games we played tonight, and it wasn't skill, but it wasn't just dumb luck either. While I&nbsp;largely ignored the other players, they spend a good deal of time and energy on obstructing one another,&nbsp;and ignored me. And all of a sudden, I'd won. Fool you once, shame on me; fool you twice, shame on you.   urlLink July Jamm   &nbsp;is this weekend, and I'll be volunteering on Friday and Saturday. Come by and see me, why don't you. The food is good, the music is good, and admission is free through the afternoon. Looks like it'll be a little cooler, too. If nothing else, you  must  try the Jiffy Burger: bacon, monterrey jack... and peanut butter.

      How much do your office's elevators suck if you've actually planned out what to do in the event that the cable snaps and you find yourself in free fall?&nbsp;  I've been on a buying spree lately, snapping up quite a bit of merchandise from various favorite movies and television shows, not to mention purchasing a realization of a mathematical joke for a friend's birthday. Don't ask. I must be feeling wealthy, because I really don't need any of this shit. Though, I think it comes with aging, the wish to crystallize certain memories in a physical form. A talisman to recall the things we know we're going to forget.  &nbsp;  It was suggested to me today that I shouldn't be friends with a certain someone simply because we happen to disagree on nearly every political and social topic imaginable. What nonsense. Those are the people I  most  need to be friends with, because that's how opinions are changed and compromises forged.&nbsp;The only way for this country to&nbsp;become a lost cause is if we start to believe that we have nothing in common with those who see the world differently. I firmly believe that I've changed a lot of people's minds simply by being honest and open about who I am, what I am, and what I think is right.  &nbsp;  Nor am I the only one. It is&nbsp;my great hope for my generation that we will improve the world simply by having&nbsp;clearer visions of one another. &nbsp;  Unrelatedly, I was called today on my bad habit of asking difficult philosophical questions of my friends that I haven't thought&nbsp;through myself. In the interest of spreading the love: do you want to have children someday? Why or why not?

      Wow, so it looks like this thing is already paying off. Tonight I received an email that's the nicest thing, written or spoken, that I've ever gotten in my life. Any attempt at a similarly lengthy reply would only belittle, so I'll leave it at: Thanks. And call.

      So, I saw  I, Robot  on Saturday night; somewhat against my will, since the trailers totally turned me off, but I'd sorta promised, so whatever. As expected, it wasn't the best movie, and dragged whenever Will Smith was onscreen. The first half hour or so, particularly. It felt like what might have originally been a thoughtful, philosophical sort of film got action scene after action scene tacked on until it was almost recognizable. &nbsp; The film does shine, however, whenever the titular robot ("Sonny") is onscreen. He's easily the most interest character in the piece, and when the others interact with him, you can finally hear the words of Isaac Asimov coming through. It says a lot that the humans ultimately, grudgingly, come to respect him as the conscious being he is. I like the occasional hopeful vision of the future mixed in with the usual dystopian fare. But please, if you see this movie and it intrigues you at all, go back and read Asimov's original stories. They'll satisfy you far more. &nbsp; So, in other news, Russ was up this weekend,&nbsp;so we had the usual gorge-and-guzzle fest. In other words, it was a blast. Converted a couple of new people to the joys of Four Swords, which is rapidly becoming my favorite game of the moment. Rewatched Bourne Identity, which wasn't as awful as I remembered it and actually makes me consider seeing Bourne Supremacy this weekend. And, learned that the Imperial Palace is closed  only  on Saturday afternoons. How bizarre is that?

      A new series premieres on the SciFi Channel tonight:  urlLink Stargate Atlantis , a spinoff of the absurdly popular Stargate SG-1. For those of you who've been living under a rock, it's a really, really,  really  good show. Now in its eighth season, it still pulls in upwards of three million viewers a week. Not to mention it's already been on longer than any Star Trek series ever was. So somebody must like it. :) &nbsp; Obviously, I haven't seen Atlantis yet, but since it shares the same writers as SG-1, it's almost certain to be excellent. It'll be on at 8:00 and again at 10:00. If you've never tuned in before, give it a shot.

      Spent last night over at James's house, first watching The Amazing Race, then playing cards with the Selleck boys. It felt good. Really good. I missed it, and them, a bit more than I realized. It's a sobering though that, in the not-too-distant future, I might not get to play for a long while. My only hope (cough, cough) is that I'll be able to do so electronically...  Thought: I wonder if an element of chance is an essential component of a game played among friends. It lets you be competitive and yet shrug off the actual outcome as unimportant. Most card games share this property, but some others do not. If nothing else, I've noticed that purely strategic games (chess comes to mind) don't seem to encourage conversation, and in my opinion, that's the reason you're playing in the first place.  The preliminary designs for the  urlLink Nebraska state quarter  are out; they'll be narrowed down and opened for voting sometime next month. Some pretty cool ones in there, not to mention the hilariously awful.  Not sure why, but I've noticed that I have next to zero libido this summer. (Yeah, yeah, TMI, cope.) I haven't so much as thought about going on a date, much less tried to meet someone. Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep. More likely, I don't feel right about getting involved with someone when my life is in a huge state of flux and I can't even be certain where I'll be in a few months.  But I also have a feeling that if I do go to KC, I'll be so absurdly busy for the first few months (year?...) that I might neglect that part of my life there, too. Not to mention having no clue where the good bars are and that sort of thing. There's the workplace itself, but I've found out the hard way that dating someone you're going to have to see every day regardless isn't exactly the best idea on earth.  Or maybe I just need to take my own advice, given to plenty of others, that love happens only when you've completely given up hope of it ever happening.

      First off, welcome back to all the kids over at Selleck. We missed you.  Just got back from Kansas City, after an unexpectedly eventful trip. As we were leaving town, Jesse decided we should take the scenic route - that is, the Kansas side instead of the Missouri side. Sounded good to me. And it  was  pretty scenic; lots of green rolling countryside. Saw Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary for the first time, a monumentally imposing structure that reminded me of nothing so much as the Smithsonian. And we made a lot of unexpected detours onto dirt roads to get past accidents or missing bridges.  Then, as we neared the Nebraska border, we noticed a nasty-looking storm looming dead ahead. Seemed like a good time to pull off, have some dinner, and wait for the storm to pass. And not a moment to soon. As we got out of the car outside a McDonalds in Hiawatha, KS, we realized that the town's tornado sirens were going off. And moments after we walked in the door, all of the power went off and stayed off. And moments after  that , lightning struck the gas price sign directly across the street. Then it started raining, horizontally, in 70+ mph winds. Turns out that a tornado was indeed passing only a few miles to the south. We only got sideswiped by the edge of it, but that was nasty enough that I don't want to think about the eye. Between the storm and the detours, by the time we got home, a normally three hour trip had taken over five hours. Now that's pretty damn scenic.  Otherwise, a pretty darn relaxing weekend. We drank a lot, slept a lot, lay around uselessly a lot. Rusty was perhaps a bit more energetic than the rest of us. Jesse and I suspect we enabled him somehow, and we're not sure how we feel about that, but all's well that ends well.  Second session starts tomorrow, which means that I'll be in Advanced Finance, 11:00 - 12:30, Monday through Friday. If your schedule is compatible with mine and you ever want to do lunch, just let me know.

      Welcome to what will likely be my earliest blog post ever. Down at Russ's place in KC again; went to the bars and got totally smashed last night. Crashed out on the futon, woke up around 7, and now here I am. Nobody else'll be up for hours. But I did get 5-6 hours of sleep, which is just as much as I get in a normal evening. And this hangover headache won't let me sleep again any time soon. So yeah.

      Just got back from watching part of  urlLink The Mysterious Cities of Gold  with James. It's by far my favorite cartoon series ever, and possible my favorite television series, period. A joint French-Japanese production, it aired several times on Nickelodeon back in 1985-1987. For people of a certain age, like me, it was our first introduction to the world of anime. And what an introduction.  The show is set in Peru at the time of Pizarro's conquest of the Incas, circa 1532. It follows the adventures of a Spanish boy and an Inca girl searching for El Dorado, the City of Gold, to which they alone carry the key. The plot of the show is pretty fanciful (sometimes echoing Stargate, even) but the settings are very much grounded in reality. All of the historical figures are real, and the backdrops are accurate reproductions of famous lost cities, including Macchu Pichu, Palenque, and Tikal. Each episode ends with a short, live-action documentary about the history and culture of South America.  True, the series was aimed at children, but I find that it's held up remarkably well over the years. The whole genre of "historical-mystery-adventure" is alive and well, and still very much appeals to me. It got me interested, not only in anime, but the musical styles of the Andes that it features prominently. I'd recommend it to you if you dug, say, Castle in the Sky, The Fifth Element, or even Indiana Jones - there's a lot of trapped temple raiding going on here, too.  It has never been released on DVD, but I've got a very high quality set on VCD. If you ever want to borrow, let me know. I'd be more than happy to share.

      I've become fond of using LOTR as a metaphor for my feelings towards a lot of my classes, and truth be told, software projects too. Even when I'm really enjoying myself, there comes a point when it needs to be over with. It's as if you've been lugging the Ring of Doom up a mountain for weeks and you finally toss it into the Crack of Oh Hell With It All Let's Go Have a Beer. An immense weight is lifted from your shoulders.  Or to quote from the new Stepford Wives, "I Love You But Please Die".

      Regardless of what you might think, I don't usually write take-home finals the night before they're due. It's not my preferred way to operate, and it doesn't result in my best work. Still, this one is turning out pretty decent, and I'll probably maintain whatever grade I had in the course anyway.  I've been getting back into BitTorrent again, to catch up on missed episodes of favorite TV series. It works a lot better than I remember it. Either they made some major improvements to the client, or the university was throttling my connection all along.  Things I didn't know: it would appear that the concept of bankruptcy is somewhat peculiar to American law. An article I read on the BBC tonight identified it as such, and explained what it was for the benefit of its British readers. Since I haven't heard of debtors' prisons lately, what exactly  do  other civilized nations do when people can't pay their bills?  It's an enduringly odd experience to spend most of your life considering yourself a realist at best and cynic at worst; and then, one day, to realize that you're rather more upbeat on humanity than most of the people you know. There's my new bumper sticker for the day: People Don't Suck.  PS: If you're going to comment here, for heaven's sake don't bother doing it anonymously. There's only a handful of people you could be anyway.

      The following post is about what the following post is not about. If you're not familiar with them already, the history and theory of  urlLink memes  would be a useful prerequisite.  Right, then: anyone who knows me has probably read the book Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, or ought to. To summarize briefly, it revolves around a "metavirus" that is both biological and informational, and can therefore be spread either through sexual contact or by seeing it in digital form. Among its other effects, it exposes some otherwise deeply buried linguistic structures within your brain and, as a result, renders you more vulnerable to infection by memes. Think of it like AIDS for the mind; your natural defense system is slowly stripped away.  This is all a perfectly good description of the Internet; as the linked article above suggests, "the ultimate meme vector". Ideas that are silly, wasteful, misleading, unfunny, or just plain stupid spread across the minds of the world with a speed and scope that would cause the CDC to swoon. Our poor minds, with their prodigious yet limited resources, are forced to spend more and more time filtering this tidal wave until they collapse of exhaustion.  Which brings me back to my original point: I've made it a conscious effort not to use this journal to spread other people's memes, and I wish more would follow suit. No collecting all the links I've read all day, no quizzes, no "which   are you?", etc. I think of it as doing my part to boost the Internet's immune system. Otherwise, we get locked into an echo chamber, where the same ideas circulate over and over again. Just ask anyone who relies on (usually only liberal or only conservative) blogs as their sole source of news.  Though, I suppose I might occasionally try to start my own memes, as in the previous post. But that's another matter entirely. :) Regardless of whether you believe any of this is literally true, it can be a useful metaphor. Unfortunately, I've just gone and spread the meme of memes themselves. Recursion joke, old: see recursion joke, old.  Back to more usual mundane matters. Got a final on Thursday, after which only one more class stands between me and a master's degree. I think I'll enjoy being called Master...  Off to Kansas City again this weekend, to visit Russ, go to the Boulevard Brewery, and generally debauch. So yay to that.  I posed this question to a friend the other day without having an answer myself, which is hardly fair: if indeed we are reincarnated, do we keep meeting the same soul mate in lifetime after lifetime? And if so, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

      Everybody should watch the season premiere of  urlLink The Amazing Race , tonight at 8:30 on CBS. It's easily my favorite television show, and the only reality series that I really get into.  The premise: ten teams race around the world, Phineas Fogg style. There's none of this "voting people off" business; the only thing standing in their way is the usual hazards of travel. People who've traveled the world will recognize many of the problems they face and the places they visit; people who haven't, will want to. It's kinda like the Travel Channel on speed. Entirely awesome. Give the first episode a chance, at least, or you're really missing out.

      Spent all day yesterday with several of my fellow JDE alumni: Mark, April, Alan, Matt, and Christy. I found it... relaxing, in a way that's difficult to describe (but I'm obviously about to try).  A cliche: they say that as you grow older, you come to appreciate ever more the people who knew you when you were young. True, I think, because the changes we go through in life matter as much as the person we are at any given moment in time. Or, to put it another way, shared experiences are the foundation of most friendships, and there are few people I've shared more experiences with than these people.  So... yeah. I can unwind around my oldest friends because, well, I feel normal. I don't have to worry about what they might think or say, because I already know perfectly well, and it's nothing to worry about. In fact, I get so laid back that they probably think me downright socially passive - I mostly listen, and rarely talk. When really, I'm just appreciating their company.  On that note: Mark and April are in Minnesota and doing well, apparently settled in to a truly blissful marriage. Alan is still in Lincoln, still erratic, inscrutiable, and brilliant. Matt has a job in Omaha but seems to be looking for a better one. Christy will be graduating with me in August and heading off to a job in England. And Drew, Alan's (and my old) roommate is still either completely without judgement or completely without fear.  In other news, I somehow found time to make it through two of the three papers I needed to finish this week. At this rate, I might actually manage to graduate. Again.

      I should really stop underestimating my own skills at bullshit. This paper that I have to write for my quantitative methods class is a good example. "Applications of Game Theory to Ad-Hoc Networks". It's not my area of expertise or my best work, but it's clear, coherent, basically accurate, and not plagiarized, which is ahead of a lot of term papers. And it's proving surprisingly easy to write. Now all I have to do is get it done and turned in by Tuesday, so that I can graduate next month...  Got a call from the lady at Cerner yesterday, needing a clarify a few items they need to do their background check. Which is a good sign, I suppose, since they probably wouldn't bother if they weren't interested.  Geek Trivia: the Taco Bell near my house turns out to be store #404.  I'm off in a few to a party at Clay's house (a kegger, even). He wouldn't let me bring food or drink, so instead, I'm bringing fireworks that I bought from James's stand. I know for a fact we're going to have some definite pyros in the crowd, so they should enjoy themselves.

      Watched Kill Bill Vol. 2 with James and Derrick tonight, the first time I've seen it since the theatre. I must say, it's held up better than I expected. I realize that Tarantino is very much an acquired taste, but I honestly believe there's a lot to like in this film. The first one is mostly about images, but the second one is mostly about dialogue and ideas. I was also reminded that there's a lot of room for sequels, should Tarantino ever choose to make one. And he's hinted he might. These are the unanswered questions from the first two films, as I see them:  * What happened to Vernita Green's daughter, whom the Bride told "When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting"? She might come after the Bride, but she might also come after her daughter, who would be the same age.  * What great crime did Bill commit, in Hattori Hanso's eyes, that would make him break his oath in order to forge a sword to kill Bill?  * Now that O-Ren is gone, who is the leader of the Yakuza, and how do they deal with those who slay their leaders?  * What happened to Elle Driver; did she survive the trailer with the black mamba? If she did, she'd certainly have it out for the Bride.  * Did Bill see through Elle's lie about the nature of his brother's death? If so, would he have put a price on her head before he died himself?  * Why did the DVAS apparently disband shortly after the Bride's "death"? Vernita, O-Ren, and Bud, at least, all apparently went their separate ways. Bud alludes to an argument and falling-out with his brother, but that's all we know.  * At the time of Bill's death, was his organization still in operation? It could be that he disbanded the DVAS and retired to raise his daughter; but it's also possible he went through new batches of them on a regular basis, a bit like Charlie's Angels. If so, are there more students of assassination (or even ex-lovers) out there who might have it in for the Bride?  * Did Bill also know the Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique? If so, who else might Pai Mei have taught it to?

      Among the many, many reasons I love Stargate SG-1 is this: in how many other series, even sci-fi series, would you get to hear a 100-year old alien warrior discuss his love for Def Jam Vendetta?  And that's just the beginning of an episode that features a character becoming trapped inside a VR simulation which, for the benefit of those observing from outside, is rendered using the Half-Life engine. I shit you not, a goodly amount of the hour is spent looking at polygonal versions of the actors. If it isn't a real mod yet, I expect that it will be very soon.  Edit: I shouldn't speak before I google; there are, of course, several such mods out there. Also, it was pointed out that the characters claim it's the Doom 3 engine, but it simply doesn't look it to me.

      Graduated today (again, again). I love this whole summer commencement thing: 800 people instead of 2,300 makes it surprisingly tolerable to sit through. I started to tell a friend today that he could call me  Master  Beermann now, before realizing that he already  does  call me that on a semi-regular basis. It's just never really registered before. I'm flattered. I think.  Two of my cousins, brother and sister, both had baby girls arrive recently. One has the first name Regan; the other, the middle name Marin. Am I the only person who's seen The Exorcist?  On my drive home from work, I pass a field where a fellow has been camped out for the last few days. Above him is a large, handpainted banner reading, "CANCER SUCKS!" You tell the man, buddy.

      So, Alan mentioned to me yesterday that he'd found and fixed a bug in the ISIS GPS code, dating from when I originally wrote it, nearly two years ago now. It caused all latitude/longitude measurements to be off by around 20 miles. It was probably caused by a combination of coding error on my part and/or my sketchy understanding of the NMEA protocol and/or the sketchy documentation for said protocol.  Normally, this sort of thing would really bother me; I'm supposed to be a professional and all, which means being methodical and testing your work thoroughly. But in this instance, I just have to laugh. I find it fucking  hilarious  that not a single developer or user, some of whom are much smarter than I am, noticed such a huge problem in a system that's been in heavy production for over a year. It's just... wow.

      Tomorrow should be a good day: besides Ribfest again for lunch, the evening brings the Olympic Opening Ceremonies and new episodes of both SG-1 and Atlantis. Alas, I'm likely to miss the latter because of a thrice-accursed reception at CBA for graduates. Bah. It's a good thing I have BitTorrent or I might be really pissy.  I'm a bit torn over Gov. McGreevey's resignation, though at a personal level I can sympathize with him. I can't decide whether he made the right decision for the wrong reasons, or the wrong decision for the right reasons. I also question just how much honor there is for a man in upholding a dishonorable and dishonest wedding vow. It doesn't excuse an affair, but it might be high time for them to go their separate ways.  One of life's small pleasures: introducing your boss to Rejected.  Do you ever get the feeling that you're living your life backwards? The best way I can sum up my overall mood lately would be: The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning...

      Tried two new games tonight, which I'd purchased based only on sales rankings and the recommendations of the good folks at  urlLink BoardGameGeek . The first, Mü & More, consists of an unusual deck of cards (12 each in 5 suits) and rules for five different games. One is like hearts, one is like pitch, one is like speed, one is like go fish, and one (the titular Mü) defies description. Nearly all of them are more complex then they seem at first, but they also tend to be mercifully quick. Not a bad value for $10 if I do say so myself.  The other game we tried, Acquire, is apparently a classic that dates back to the '60s, but is still in print and still played in tournaments. None of us had ever heard of it or played it before, though. You place tiles on a city-like grid, causing clusters of tiles ("corporations") to form and eventually merge, netting you shareholder bonuses and capital gains. Pretty interesting stuff, though I don't think I quite have the strategy down yet. As if I  ever  do...  Ribfest starts tomorrow! Barbecue is awesome, and a choice of a half-dozen vendors is even more awesome.  Also met Tracy's long-mysterious boyfriend, Eric, over dinner at Lazlo's tonight. Seemed like a pretty nice fellow, a film studies major, maybe a bit on the quiet side. But there's one lesson I've learned over the years, often and well: the ones who seem quiet, very rarely actually are. In fact, they often have the most interesting things to say. You just need to figure out how to get them talking.

      ...if I implied in my previous post that Myst IV was pretty nifty. It's  absolutely fucking amazing.  Proof: when you start the demo, stay put, but spin the camera around so you're looking up, perhaps in the direction of the moon. Leave it like that for a few minutes. I've seen a lot of things in video games before, but I haven't seen anything look quite that good, and for a throwaway detail, no less. It makes me want to fly to Ubisoft Studios and hump the animator's leg.  Also, a hint: once you pick up the only item in the demo, go back and revisit the earlier areas. Some will have changed.  So, it seems that I'm having lunch with Eric Graber (!) and his girlfriend (!!!). What exactly she's doing in Lincoln, much less in the United States, remains to be seen.

      I have a strict policy of not using beta software from Microsoft, but when Service Pack 2 reached RTM I couldn't avoid it any longer. It took forever to download and install, but has otherwise been painless. In fact, I can barely notice the difference, even though I know perfectly well what all has changed, and I suspect most normal users will feel likewise.  It is a bit surprising how often I've been hitting the security warnings about programs trying to connect to the Internet, considering that the new Windows Firewall (AFAICT) only actually blocks inbound traffic. Makes virus activity easier to detect and stop, I suppose. The new wireless networking definitely seems stabler, and less apt to switch channels just because it detects someone's random peer-to-peer connection.  Launching applications, opening menus, etc, feels a bit snappier but that could be purely psychological. The layout of the Security Center seems to have changed a bit since RC2. I wish I had a newer processor so I could test the NX security. All in all, not bad. We'll see how this affects virii in the coming months.  Spent most of the day playing with the  urlLink Myst IV: Revolution demo  which, astonishingly, runs like a dream on my oldish Dell laptop with its 1GHz chip, 256MB of RAM, and 16MB graphics card. They must have done a pretty decent job of optimizing it. And massive props for releasing the Mac version simultaneously with the PC. Don't see that much anymore.  Also took my brother out to dinner for his half-birthday, since his actual birthday got missed while he was at school. Outback Steakhouse is  yum,  particularly their Bloomin' Onions, even if they do have something like 2,000 calories each.

      So yeah, one of our cats died while I was away this weekend. I can't say it comes as a total surprise - she was sixteen years old and had been sick for a while. But it still sucks. Even more so for my brother, who actually had to bury her himself since the rest of us were out of town.  Other than the news waiting for me at home, a pretty good weekend all around. Definitely leaning towards a loft now; need to call them tomorrow and snap one up before they get rented. A  second  night of drunken debauchery at Rusty's; this time, drunken computer assembly! I think we must have done something wrong, though, because he can only get Doom 3 to run at 5-10 FPS, despite having a really nice graphics card, plenty of memory, and the latest versions of everything. Maybe he'll have figured it out by the time he reads this.  This week is the last week of summer classes, meaning that in a few short days I'll have a degree.  Another  degree. I swear, they're starting to seem like baseball cards or something...

      Back in Kansas City this weekend, this time looking for an apartment. I find myself attracted to the lofts downtown, as opposed to the various apartment complexes out in the suburbs. There's such a mind-numbing identicalness to seemingly every complex built in the last twenty years. Little beige boxes, all of them. A few high ceilings and exposed brick walls do more than you can imagine to raise my spirit. Also, by the time you get done considering utilities, parking, etc, their prices are really quite similar.  Other things to figure out: which banks have branches both in Lincoln and in Kansas City? Precious few, as it turns out.  Not quite the orgy of debauchery of past weekends, but I'm still having a good time over at Russ's. I keep meeting new faces in addition to the ones I've meet in weeks past. It's quite the little harem Rusty has going. Keeps life interesting, anyway.  Even I must admit that Doom 3 looks pretty sexy, though I still can't imagine playing it myself. I need a good excuse to buy a new video card (if not an entire system) in order to play something or other. Suggestions?

      For those of you who haven't yet had the pleasure of graduating, here's a primer on academic attire: Bachelors' tassels are the school colors, doctors' tassels are gold, and masters' tassels depend on their discipline. Since I'm an MBA, that means I get to wear a tassel and hood that are a putrescent salmon-like color. I believe it's officially called "drab". And for the privilege of being drab I get to pay $50. Yay...

      The Games of the XXVIII Olympiad of the Modern Era begin next Friday night. I plan to watch them religiously, as I do every two years. It surprises even me; I've never participated in any athletics, nor do I usually enjoy watching them on TV. Why, then, do I have such an attachment to the Olympics? Mostly to try to understand myself, here's a list, in no particular order:  * The Olympics absolutely reek with symbolism, ancient and modern, from beginning to end. As an example, this year's marathon is being run along its 2,500 year-old original course, from Marathonas to Athens. How often do you see such old traditions being observed today? (More than you think; ask me about Reagan's funeral sometime.) I've got a huge soft spot for rituals of all kinds, even when their original significance has been forgotten. They make you feel connecting with the past in a way that simply reading history never can.  * When you see someone compete at the Olympics, you know without doubt that they are among the best in the world at whatever it is they do. There's a peculiar thrill that goes with that, even when you wouldn't otherwise be interested in the activity. I enjoy watching masters at their craft, basically. World Poker Tour is another good example of the same phenomenon.  * They only happen every two years. Well,  duh,  but it means that I don't have a chance to get sick of them. I can watch anything once, but these days it seems like most of the professional sports somehow manage to go year-round; they're always on. The games are not.  * There's a huge variety of things going on, and you can never hope to see them all. Maybe I've just got a short attention span, but it's kinda cool to be able to flick on the TV and have an equal chance of seeing dozens upon dozens of different sports; some featuring people you've heard of, and many that you haven't. It feels like serendipity.  * It's a travelogue. The Olympics take place all over the world in historic and, let's face it, often gorgeous locales. I like  The Amazing Race  for essentially the same reason. Also, the host cities spend years and millions of dollars to look their absolute shining best. It's probably a worthy goal in its own right (urban renewal), but it also gives them a fairy-tale quality that can't ever be replicated in a later visit.  I think that's the gist of it. So yeah, I'll be watching. Anyone gets bored, invite me over and we'll do so together. (Oh, and also: I got to hold an actual Olympic torch once, back in 1996. So awesome.)  Finally, of course, the obligatory news tidbits: I finally got Jesse to go to the Oven, which he enjoyed; the long delay was apparently due to his inexplicable theory that the place was only for dates. Strange, Jesse, strange. Everybody help me think of something to get/do for his birthday, which is coming up very soon.  Ribfest starts next weekend, and I can hardly wait. Still need to see the Village, about which I've been getting mixed but not wholly negative reviews. A new batch of games is on the way from GameSurplus, an entirely awesome site with really good prices. Rsync might be one of the most Unix-centric programs ever written. Alan's site is down, due to his altruistic and slightly silly gesture of sacrificing its innards to revive his employer's server. Google's initial public offering will raise  e  billion dollars.  That is all.

      So I got a form letter today from Chuck Hagel's office. (Are you listening, Tom?) I had contacted them to register my opposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment. I would assume, or hope, that all such contacts get a letter in reply, but I'd have to imagine they had more than usual on this issue. A  urlLink press release  is attached to the letter explaining his position on the matter.  "Americans and Nebraskans have been presented with a false choice between amending the Constitution of the United States or allowing same sex marriage across our country... Over our nation's history, social and policy issues have been best handled by the state... Amending the constitution, the founding document of our nation, should always be a final option, not a first." Brilliantly put, Chuck. I couldn't have said it better myself.  But then he goes off a cliff. The matter never made it to a vote; instead, senators voted on whether or not to continue debate ("cloture", if you're curious). He voted to keep the issue alive. "There is much misinformation about this amendment. I believe the American people would have benefited from continued debate and a further understanding of this deeply complicated and important issue."    Excuse me? The proposed amendment was  one sentence long.  I'm pretty damn sure I understood  exactly  what it said. Further, the debate  I  heard was doing precious little to combat misinformation; if anything, there were senators throwing more into the pot. Perhaps more importantly, had the amendment come to a real vote, how would you have voted, Chuck? Your press release implies "no", but your beliefs and voting record on related issues implies "yes". Since it's certain to come up again, year after year, it's something that I, the represented, urgently want to know. For goodness sake, stop trying to talk around it. Please.  On the plus side, though? Franking privileges are  awesome.

      Is there a substantive difference between love and trust?  Aside from the abortion crowd, why don't right-wing nutcases protest things as often as left-wing nutcases do?  If the saying "the good ones are always taken" is true, and you're not taken, are you therefore not a good one?  Considering it takes so much more energy to hate someone than to get along with them, how do so many people around the world manage to hate so many without becoming exhausted?  Why do we depend on, or even expect, others to make us happy?  How often is someone's opinion changed by what someone else says, rather than does?  Am I channeling Rusty right now or  what?

      This is an interim I'm-not-dead post on my parents' computer, since my laptop is currently hosed. Sometimes even I wonder what use a computer science degree is, but I can't do a thing about it until at least tomorrow.
