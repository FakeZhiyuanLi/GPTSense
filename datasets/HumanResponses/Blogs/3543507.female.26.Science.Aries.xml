       urlLink     Baz looking picturesque in the old witches village in Western Liguria&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink We hired a car and drove down west of Genova .&nbsp; First we stopped off at Finale Liguria and sat on the beach and had a wander.&nbsp; We tried to get a hotel but it was far too busy.&nbsp; So failing that we went to Noli, (nice medievil village with walls round it) for something to eat then went back to the flat in Genova.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Sunday we drove out to western liguria again... first we went to alassio for something to eat, and we walked all along the shore and ate pisa and pastry.&nbsp; We got in the car then and drove down argentina valley, or the silver valley from&nbsp;Taggia&nbsp;right up into the mountains.&nbsp; At the top of the valley is a medievil village Triora in the middle of nowhere and very atmospheric and bit creepy - they burnt loads of 'witches' there in the 16th century... we went to the witch museum, but couldn't understand anything as was in italian.&nbsp; Back down the mountain we both of us got ripped off by some little old lady by buying a cheese each for 18 euros (don't ask). Finally we went to San Remo, and looked round the old part of the town which is medievil again.&nbsp; My left foot was roughly about 2 times the size of the right one (due to mosquitoe bites and infection). But apart from that it was all very nice....

       urlLink     (Cue Jurassic Park Music! ... der der da dahhh, der der dah da!!!) Retch n Smell's epic trek!&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  hmm, difficult to know where to start with this one.... First of all me and Retch had to fly back to Genova Nervi from Florence to meet up with Patrizia at 6pm.&nbsp; We were told to pack up essential stuff into back-packs and we all went off in a group of about 6 at about 8pm to camp out the night at the highest point of Monte Portofino.&nbsp; We took lots of food and drink.&nbsp; The plan was to just sleep there without tents... but soon after the wine and food had been eaten and drunk.... it started to piss down.&nbsp; Now, not being a natural camper, i had proceeded to drink quite a bit to get used to the idea of sleeping outside... so it was quite fun trying to walk back down the mountain pissed in the pissing rain in the pitch black at 1 in morning.  &nbsp;  The next day me and retch woke up early and we all with Patrizia decided to go for a walk anyway as the weather looked better.&nbsp; Me and Rach decided this sounded like a nice idea - to go for a nice cliff walk to the beach... we decided to plan accordingly and be sensible and&nbsp;so took the following between both of us:  1. 2 spare pairs of knickers  2. face powder  3. 2 handbags  4. 2 beach towels  5. suntan lotion  6. one book and 3 postcards with pen  ..so that is how me and rach went prepared for  urlLink our near death experience on the 5 hour trek on the unofficial path across portofino peninsular ...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       urlLink    Rach requested that I should put this particular photo (as an illustration of just how cultured we were) as the main picture.  Rach and me went to Florence to become more cultured.  It took us about 3 wrong journeys (from nervi to work, work to genova, genova back to nervi, nervi back to genova, then finally genova through nervi again to florence)- actually getting lost was a theme for  urlLink the whole Florence visit .       We stayed the night there and scoffed loads of food, we totally and utterly got lost, had no map, ruined our flip-flopped feet (again) and nearly cried until some unknown took pity and gave us their map (an angel, we decided).  We also discovered a market with lots of ear-rings and scarves and spent most of our last day posing in them (see photos).  Rachel has demon haggling powers by the way.  The last hour in Florence we decided we should really try and be a bit cultural and ran round this old palace in the centre.  V good. Good views (see photo above).  We particularly admired the arty naked statues (again see photo above). And then that was it as far as culture was concerned... we ran to catch the train to Pisa then Genova for the next leg of Retch's Italy weekend.  We were knackered, we had walked about so much, we were pretty tired, (see photos of us on train) and generally exhausted.  In hind sight, we were about as unprepared as you could get for the hours that followed and the risking of both life and limb... &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is a picture of Denise being very romanesque in Verona's ampitheatre.  Denise and I, the  urlLink 'pale and interesting girls'  stayed on Lake Guarda, arriving friday we proceeded to get relatively drunk after we couldn't find anything to eat.   The next day, feeling relatively rough, we tripped off to Verona by train.  We looked round the amphitheatre (sp?) and I forcefully dragged D into some shops. We disappointingly discovered as pale and interesting girls we can't fit into italian bra-ware.   We braved the lack of ordered queue and resultant stampede of Italians and rubbed the right breast of the statue of Juliet (4 good luck in our love lives).   Verona was very nice, i seem to remember lots of ice cream, and Denise not allowing us to go in any restaurant with 'picture menus' even though  I   was OK with this.  Saturday night we went to a surreal club in the middle of nowhere off lake guarda called Hollywood in the middle of massive thunder storm (which made it more surreal).  Denise nicely summed up the dress-code as 'Tom Criuse circa 1990'... we had a good time there however the straw that broke Denise's back was the sheer enjoyment had by all when DJ played 'Cotton-Eye-Joe', I whole heartedly agreed and we departed swiftly.   On sunday, waking up a little frail after Holywood, we decided to take it easy.  However fate had something else in store for us... becos we accidently set off on a 12km hike down the 'A' road of lake Guarda and then down a peninsula.  Even though we both ruined our feet with evil 'holiday shoes'(open sores, blisters etc etc) we both had a very nice time, we particularly enjoyed laughing at hilarious italian 'fashion gaffs'. Good time had by all, and not too much over-analysis by either of us... &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Barry in 'comedy pose' with Torre Pendante! Me and Baz went to Florence and then went to Pisa and Cinqueterre.  All in just 2 days so very hectic... but felt very cultcherd by the end of it.  Everyone in Pisa was doing this 'comedy shot' with the tower - but it would be rude not to really... shortly after this photo Baz bought a tastefull 2 foot leaning tower ceramic lamp, bargain price of 8 euros, so again it would be rude not to... wouldn't it! See more of  urlLink Baz's whistle stop tour  and us soaking up cultcha in Firenze!  &nbsp; urlLink    urlLink

      Hi I am stuck in labs and its late... have started having panicky thoughts about thesis... guilty thoughts... I have spent more time shopping than thesis writing  And obviously this Blog spot thing is another thing to do besides dreaded thesis  I don't understand too, because everyone else's blog spot looks better than mine. I don't know how to put on photos or anything.    Keep hearing creepy noises in the lonely labs.  :-(

       urlLink    &nbsp; I took the train down from Genova to Roma, and tried to find the hotel which was on the real outskirts of Roma... and met up with Helen there.&nbsp; The 'airconditioning' of the first hotel was a small fan, but we got a much nicer hotel after that near to the main train station.&nbsp; Helen had arrived in 3 inch stilletoes, with (just in case) an extra 4 pairs of stilletoes in her case.&nbsp; The first day was just me and Helen... we went round the historical centre, on a walk in one of helen's guide book with comedy compass.&nbsp; Helen's feet were hurting due to stilletoes after the first 30 minutes, and feet (dirtiness of, painfullness of, infection due&nbsp;to mosquitoe bites of, freaky small toes of) were to be&nbsp;the running theme of the whole weekend. On our first walking tour me and helen funnily enough arranged to go past shops, but we also saw the Pantheon (2 thousand years old Roman building still in use) and by accident walked around the whole perimeter of ancient Roma (despite comdey compass).&nbsp; Then me and Helen went to eat and talked about romance. Met up with Emz late that night... we got beer and drank it.&nbsp; The next day me, Emz and H all went to ancient Roma, we went round the Domus Aureas (a old palace built by emporor nero before the colluseum), which is all underground due to romans building baths on top.&nbsp; Then we all got dressed up to look respecible (which took quite a while for me) and went to the Vatican.&nbsp; Went into St Peters Basilica, and then H and E forced me (despite fear of heights) to walk up to the top of the dome in some of H's evil stilletoes, then they laughed about it.&nbsp; The view was good tho from the top, tho of course I didn't admit it to them. We all got dressed up that night.&nbsp; After a whole day of limping on Helen's part, she put on a pair of 4 inch stilletoes and floated over the cobbles all round roma that evening - amazing, the power of alcohol.  Emma, Helen and me in Italy!!!&nbsp; urlLink
