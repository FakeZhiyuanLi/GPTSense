      It`s Monday and I`m sleepy, hungry and my tummy had a bit of tantrums.  I`ll just wrap up wut had happened to me on Friday evening until last Sunday.    On Friday evening, exactly at 6.30 p.m (Shah Village), I went to the Radio Survey 2004 and it was lots of fun…. So wut do I have to do to get a clasp of RM50…just listen to a total of 380 snippets of songs for merely 10 seconds and just tick the numbers between 1 to 5. 1 for the “I really hate this f**king song” to number 5 for the “This number is one of my favourite”.  I had fun just doing it.  I went with Wanna and met another gurl, Baizura. We tick up the numbers and we pick up our token.  Talk about easy money. (I need that cash.. I was totally broke… I know I won`t get my pay till the first week of June… cheapskates *&^%%^&)  Wut was the deal anyway??... spend a few hours and get free dosh….I was a bit skeptic at first, thinking that people would pay for this kind of service.  A few years back, Nani told me about this type of paid surveys. And I was thinking, wut kind of work would you do for about 2 hours and get paid RM50 to RM60. That`s kinda nut… Thinking that people would do ugly stuffs to me. I didn`t go for that coffee survey discussion.  Don’t blame me I was scared.    Then a few weeks back. Aunty Ida asked me if I want to join this type of survey discussions, hmmm… I was really interested and the major thing was I trusted her.  TRUST people…u got to have the TRUST.. I was a bit scared so I asked her if I could let my friend joined in… Aunty Ida agrees.. so I just asked Phatana out.  It’s great that she wants to join and yeah I got to spend a bit time with her.  But the main catch here was… we have to ignored each other and act like a total strangers …ihhihihi.. Damn it was hard…. But everything turns out ok… I really enjoy the discussion about a “certain-quite-famous” furniture store here in Malaysia.  The attendees were about 8 people and there was the facilitator cum researcher.  We got to introduced our self  and those people are all professionals.  One lady was a lawyer, one in a real-estate business, one was an accounts teacher and some are doing their own business and yeah me and Phatana was just merely working as u know mgmt. trainee and me one lousy educator.  Feel a bit left out at first but there are all nice individuals.  Damn… no cute guys available… :(.  The discussion went out smoothly and very much informative.  I enjoy every bit of it as I do talk a lot.  People say that first experience will always have the best feelings and yeah you won’t forget the moments easily.  I had tons of fun and yeah RM120 richer… The survey lasted about 3 to 4 hours and left me tired.    Had a brief of discussion with Phatana on our journey back to Jelatek.  We thought that the discussions was fun and we do think that the organizer was smart enough man… concentrated ideas from users… and spend out a little amount consider that they will have millions of fortune derived from it.  Concentrate on wut user really wants.. that`s the main key. Being a guinea pig for the benefits of all consumers…  Wut the heck… we got our share.. just shut our mouth laaa… hiihihih  I`m really looking forward for these kinds of surveys… I`m addicted to it… I`m in for the moneyyyyy…..   On Saturday, I can`t remember much wut I did. I just sleep a lot.  My world of happiness is my very own bedroom.  It`s really damn messy… stuffs are all over the place.. cd’s clattered on the floor, books everywhere, clothes hanging around all sorts of places, dusts starts to fill the empty spot.. thick dust.. hiihhihi… it`s an officially a pig sty.. Not a place for a gurl to sleep in.. My parents are really mad at me… (luckily the renovation gave me a lot of reasons not to indulged myself in doing any cleaning). I have no time people… I`m so suck in time management… I rather watch TV 24 hours then do any cleaning. I`m not focus enough.  But when I`m focus… I give out my all.  Well back to my room, no matter how it looks like, no matter how untidy it was.. it`s MINE.. my own private Idaho.. hiihih..  I`m gonna get a bigger room after the renovation and I`m all excited.  Thinking about having my own movie/game room.  It`s gonna be a blast and I will have my own hype space… I just can`t wait….  On Sunday,..well like every other Sunday, me and my family went out to see my brother in UiTM for the National Service thingy.  He looks awful at the beginning when he started the service but now he seems a lot happier I might say. Another week to go bro… another week.. just hang in there… Had a brief argument with my parents.. yeah yeah regarding my “ohh-so-beautiful-room”… I’m a big egoistic.  I can`t believe I can’t take small statements from my dad and mum.. Being childish I might say… When they hell I`m gonna grow up… I`m still a child at heart.. child at mind.. ahrggg… I`m so confuse.. I`m sorry mom..I`m sorry pa… for acting that way.. arghhh how I wish I should tell them how I am really sorry.  I just can`t do it… I couldn`t understand it.  I`m sorry…..  when I woke up this morning.. everything was fine as usual.. sumtimes I do wonder why should I acted like an a** ?.. I love my family damn much... that won`t change...
