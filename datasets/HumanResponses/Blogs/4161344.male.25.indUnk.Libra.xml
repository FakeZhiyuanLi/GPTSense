      Not too long ago I realized my music collection essentially sucked.  Perhaps it isn't fair to say that it  completely  sucked, since there was, and still is, a good amount of quality music.  Some Miles Davis mixed with some Gorillaz, Ben Folds Five wrapped around some Beatles, etc.  But there was also the Michelle Branch, the Stacie Orrico, and yes, even an Ashlee Simpson tune.  The problem wasn't really that I had bad taste in music, either.  It simply was that the ratio of quality music to sugary, cancerous music was just too unbalanced for my comfort.  Two things occured to make me realize this.  One:  I read High Fidelity by Nick Hornby  Two: I bought an iPod  When you read High Fidelity, you suddenly realize that there are a lot of albums out there that you like but never bother to remember because the only people who remember some of these bands are music snobs.  I am not a music snob, and if I ever were to make that claim the other music snobs would promptly kick my ass.  Or at least give me the scoffing of a lifetime.   But in this book, you realize that there are a lot of great bands out there that you most certainly have heard before but can never remember who they are.  For example, I've heard the Beta Band so many times, yet it wasn't untill recently that I figured out who they were and that, yes, Heros for Zeros is a pretty rockin album.  While reading High Fidelity I started to feel guilty, not for having no taste in music, but for ignoring some great musicians simply because MTV hadn't thrust them in my face.  For shame, Andy, for shame.  It made me miss college when all I would ever see were quality bands that no one had ever heard of.  Guster, Dan Bern, Kris Delmhorst, I salute you.  The iPod.  It's amazing how suddenly your entire music collection can be criticized because you just happen to be holding it in the palm of your hand.  I had been wanting an iPod pretty much since they arrived on the scene, but held off because 1) they kept releasing better versions and I was holding out for a good one and 2) (and most prominently, I might add) I couldn't afford one even if I sold both my kidneys.  So with my recently getting a new job at a major wireless company, my income became slightly more padded (imagine going from wireframe bucket seats in a car to having a piece of cloth draped over the rusty springs - that's the level of padding we are talking here) enough for me to slurge on something - naturally my little music machine was top on my list.  So I buy the 40Gb iPod, and though my wallet is $400 lighter, I am a thousand times happier.  I proudly display my new toy to everyone.  "What do you have on there?" they ask, and I gladly hand them the unit so they could bask in the glory of my collection.  "Have any Nirvana?"  No.  "Any Cure?" No.  "Any Al Green?  Marvin Gaye?  Cream?" No, no, no.  "Do you have anything good?" Well, I do have Guster...  "Who?"   Damnit.  See, what good is having a quality music collection if no one knows what the hell half the stuff in your collection is?  And, if the other half is sugary, overindulgant pop music, they are naturally going to assume that the first half, even though they have never heard it before, is ALSO sugary overindulgant pop music.  Thus, I had become, in the eyes of my peers, a mindless slave to a catchy beat and teenage girls singing about how their boyfriends suck.   I needed a fix.  I mostly needed the fix because this whole realization that I came off as a musical Forrest Gump made me slightly depressed.  No one is going to talk to you about music if they think you haven't got an ounce of taste in your bones.  So I went to the guru, the god of musical trivia.  I spoke to my little brother.  Jonathan, my brother, is a sort of musician.  I say sort of musician because he is really like the fruit basket of music.  Jonathan samples a bit of all styles, rather than serving as a main course for any one given genre.  For example, he is a bassist that plays jazz, hip-hop and funk, but he also mixes a damn fine electronic beat and dabbles in the piano.  His collection ranges from the most obscure jazz musician to the best of cream, and shoots all over in betweeen.  He's my go-to guy when it comes to musical advice.  So Jonathan gives me a list, I start hunting around for cds from friends and family to rip and store on my precious iPod.  I'm feeling good, I've gotten most of it, and now I'm feeling close to complete.  So I have, essentially, revamped my life in terms of my music collection.  Do you have any Cream?  Why, yes, I do.  I also have Beta Band, Velvet Underground, and a smidge of Massive Attack.  Would you like some Portishead to go with that?  Perhaps I come off as somewhat shallow, believing my music collection has some impact on my worth as a human being.  But hey, I got a better soundtrack than most in my head when I'm walking down the street.  And it's not Stayin Alive, I garuntee it.

      Oh, by the way, allow me for a moment to elaborate on the aforementioned "jumping off a cliff" scenario.  The whole cliff thing plays out like this:  When I was in junior high I lived with my family in the Lakes Region, New Hampshire, right on Lake Winnepesaukee.   I consider these times to be among the best of my life, especially since, at the time, I had grown a distaste for the salty water of the Atlantic Ocean so having a large body of fresh water nearby made for some delightful swimming experiences.  Often my friends and I would take a small boat out to one of the islands and just chill while swimming in the rather clear and clean lake.   Some time closer to the end of my life in New Hampshire I recall being at a party where most of the youngsters decided to take a boat out to an island where there was this cliff.   The cliff rose above the water at varying levels, from "quite safe to jump" to "sane people need not apply".  Naturally, most of the kids involved went straight for the insane cliff.  Not me.  I figured that, given my track record for mishap and misfortune, I was much better off staying in the "shallow" end.  This, as it would seem, would not do for my friends (and in this situation perhaps that term could have been used loosely, for in my mind a friend would not have enticed me to throw myself from a precipice).  However, peer pressure and the threat of the dare was more than I could resist, so up I climbed and prepared to hurtle myself into the air.  I took a deep breath, started to run towards the cliff, and then suddenly stopped before I could jump off.  Then I went back again, ran again, and stopped again.  I repeated this cycle some four or five more times, and each time I failed to leap off that cliff the cheers and encouragement just increased.  But it wasn't the crowd that pushed me off that ledge, it was one voice.  Kayden, my first crush, began to say as I tried yet again to make that jump, that if I could jump off, then she would.....  I never really heard what she would do if I managed that jump, because before she could finish my mind had run through all the possibilities of things that she could do and was so excited by the prospect of ANY of them happening that I promptly threw myself off the cliff and into the water below.   To my surprise, there really wasn't any opportunity for death or disaster on the way down.   Kayden, having not finished stating what her end of the bargain was to be, simply gave me a hug and left it at that.  I might have felt cheated, but the cliff ended up having slightly more significance in my life than my crush on Kayden and the potential to get more out of it.  See, once I jumped off the cliff I realized that it was actually quite fun and exciting. And then I thought, I wonder what else can be fun and exciting once I give it a try.  So I started trying things.  Acting, sports, sex, drugs, all of my experimentation later in life stems really from this one moment, the birth of my "I'll try most anything once" philosophy.

      I've realized that different friends will have a different level of connection to the internet.  Sure there's the issue of connection speed.  Mary has dial-up, Peter has DSL and John is using his brand-new wireless card and pays $75 a month to get unlimited internet access whereever his little techy heart desires.  But the connection of which I speak is completely divorced from the speed of one's connection.  I know individuals who have the most advanced internet service in the world, practically, and still lack the simple ability to return my emails in a timely manner.   I do not chastise these individuals, merely find it to be a curiosity.  One can spend countless hours looking through various websites to get info on the sort-lived series FLCL or the latest update on the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie, yet have some sort of block when it comes to writing even the shortest of emails.  Not even an acknowledgement, like "Hey, got your email, I'm so busy right now but hey thanks for the thought and I'll get back to you with more later".  What in the name of the holy father prevents an individual from clicking the "reply" button and induldging in some electronic conversation just once and a while?   I of course absolve those individuals whose life does not revolve around the internet.  I have a friend who, for the last few months, has spent the majority of his time *gasp* outdoors working at a Boy Scout camp.  With no readily availible internet terminal in the woods, I can see how he'd be unable to keep up on the whole email exchange.  But he is indeed a minority in a group of friends that largly seems to enjoy procrastinating when it comes to email replys.   I think I'll mostly attribute it to the same syndrome that causes us to sometime long for the answering machine to pick up whenever we call someone.  I do this quite often, call someone and hope that the voicemail answers so I can leave a message rather than have to engage in actual, real-time conversation.  Perhaps this desire to delay interaction extends into the world of electronic mail and creates in us a desire to put off the inevitable conversation as long as we can so we might think of something specially witty to say.

      Somewhere along the way I picked up this crazy notion that romance in real life parallels romance in the movies.  I must have been about 11 years old the first time I really ever desired another human being.  It was this girl named Kayden, and I had such a crush on her you could not believe.   Or perhaps you can, since I'm convinced that most people have, at some point in their lives, had a Kayden, or some generic variation of Kayden.  I wouldn't say I was in love with her, but I certainly wanted her in a way that trancended a facination with breasts, which at the time was still very much new and very much on the minds of my fellow prepubecent brothers.   Things with Kayden could have gone more smoothly, I'm convinced, if I hadn't been in Junior High School.  Had my first bout with romance occurred many years later I'm sure I would have handled the whole affair with much more style and grace.   I may have attempted to sweep her off her feet with some poetic speech highlighting the finer aspects of her person, probably throwing in some comment about how she made me feel lighter than air itself and how I would gladly throw myself off a cliff for her (side note:  I later did actually throw myself off a cliff for her, but that's another story).  Instead, I spent the greater part of two years trying to formulate coherent sentences in her presence.  By the time this whole thing finally came to a head the whole of my class knew of my infatuation and percieved it as cute.  Tiring, but cute.   I eventually asked Kayden out on a "date".  I use this term loosly because at this point in our relationship we were sound friends and hung out with eachother on a regular basis.  The only reason this was a date was because I had decided to call it that quite without her permission.  But you have to understand, I could not fathom there being anything BUT a date, since I so clearly cared for her and, according to the movies, when a person cares for a person enough, then the other person will eventually love him back.  So I naturally assumed that Kayden must have felt something for me by now, because I had been persuing her for such a long time.  We went to see some Michael J. Fox movie (which sucked) my mom picked us up, I dropped her off and proceeded to believe that we were now going steady.  Why?  Because in my mind I had created a scenario where Kayden loved me and we were destine for eachother.  I proceeded to announce to a great many people that we were an item.  Rest assured this was news to Kayden when I told her.  Her reaction was my first encounter with the REALITY of romance.  The whole exchange occured at my going-away party.  My family was moving from our small New Hampshire town and my friends were all sending me off.  I pulled Kayden aside and tried to tell her how I felt about her.  I wanted to say I loved her, because at the time I was certain that's what I felt.  Instead I said something jumbled about missing her and how hard it would be.  "Well, It's not like we're dating," she said.  "Oh..." My heart tore in two "Well, er, that's what I told everyone else"  People like me should have been born mutes.  Her sudden, shocked reaction woke up a latent cynic burried deep inside my innocent shell.  For the first time I began to realize that romance had a darker side, the side that was rough and crinkled and inhabited the whole of reality.  I quickly made some joke to cover up my blunder, passing the whole statement off as some sort of failed attempt at humor, and never spoke about it to her again.  But the movie romantic in me was not killed that day.  He reasserted himself just a short day later, before I left that sleepy NH town for good.  I bought a small, heart shaped locked for Kayden and made a special trip to her house to give it to her.  She was quite surprised and looked like she wanted to say something more.  There's a part of me that wants to believe she was ready to confess her feelings for me.  In reality, she just probably thought I was crazy.  Sweet, but crazy.  Side note:  During the whole Kayden affair there was this girl named Sarah.  This Sarah was actually the first of a string of mishaps involving girls named Sarah.  Sarah #1 was one of the sweetest girls I knew.  In hindsight, this girl probably liked me very much, perhaps even enough to go on a real date with me.  Sadly, I was so overwhelmed with the Kayden affair that I missed it entirely.  I've spent some time wondering if I had paid attention to Sarah, would I have had a better experience with love and romance my first time out of the gate.  Then again, one also has to consider that I did move away and had absolutely no opportunity to develop any sort of romance with the lovely Sarah #1.  Still, part of me likes to think that if I had the ability to redo time and change my actions Sarah and I could have been an item.  Romance from this point out fluxuated between being something fantastic and something gut-wrenching.  Usually, the fantastic part occured when I wanted a girl but hadn't yet built up the courage to speak to her.  The gut-wrenching part was usually after I had spoken to her and was (sometimes) politely shot down.  There was perhaps a total of 5 of these girls over my high school career, only two of which are of note.  The first is Renee.  Renee was some 4 years older than me and is of interest really because she was the one that made me start smoking.  15 years old and in Paris, dying to impress an older girl I walk into a newsshop and purchase a pack of Marlboros.  I then proceed to smoke, on and off, for some 10 years, proving that my desire for romance made me one stupid mofo.  There really isn't much else to say about Renee.  I annoyed her, and her being annoyed just made me pine more.   The second girl worth mentioning was Yana, a pretty Latvian girl that lived next door to me for some time.  My heart had been jumpstarted instantly when I saw her and pretty much took over like some sort of ancient programming that had laid dormant since the Kayden fiasco.  I once agian was ready to to most anything for her.  In this case jumping off a cliff was not necessary.  Instead, I decided to play a different angle- I decided to learn her language.  There was really no practical application for the Russian language in my life.  I had no desire to visit Russia, nor had I ever really enjoyed anything Russian, save for the sight of the lovely Yana.  But I enrolled in my high school's Russian class with one Mrs. Shuttleworth and began my persuit.   Let me say, Russian is damn hard.  First of, you have all these funky letters.  It's a whole new frickin alphabet, and makes no sense, really.  Just jumbled versions of our letters re-ordered so that Americans can't tell which is the equivelant of the letter "a" and which is their own ass.  Needless to say, I was not able to woo Yana as quickly as I'd hoped, and before long she started dating a young guy named Maxim, who was also from Latvia and obviously had a head start on me in the language department.   Side Note: for some reason I continued to study Russian into college.  I really don't like quitting, to be honest.  Which explains my relentless persuit of romance, I suppose.  Now I'm quite certain that not finding true love in high school made me doomed for a life of solitude.  In fact, towards the end a young lady quite unexpectedly entered my life.  I was just starting to build up the courage and confidence to start auditioning for plays, something I had been longing to do since my debut as a turtle in the second grade (see previous blog).  Russ, my good friend at the time (who I later ended up hating with a fire of a thousand suns) introduced me to a friend of his, another young actor named Julie.  Julie was smart, pretty, confident, and attracted to me.  This combination was enough for me to want her, and with great difficulty I managed to ask her out on a real date.  Again, the date was to be a movie (I could never think of a better date than a movie at this time in my life).  Julie and I had a nice time, discussed music, talked about life and dreams, and then, as the gods of confidence looked down upon me, I smiled, told her "I'm going to try something..." and leaned in to kiss her.  Let me explain something: I had kissed girls before, even on the lips, but never had it been welcomed, even enjoyed by the other party.  Most of my kisses up to this point had been awkward at best and ill concieved in the first place.  This was a GOOD kiss, and that made all the difference.  Julie and I started dating, actually dating, and she even went so far to call me her boyfriend, a title and rank which I proudly wore.   And things were good, for a while.  But then I went off to college and in her fear, Julie decided it would be ok to "see other people".  I didn't really want to see other people, but I also didn't want to be the only one NOT seeing other people, so I ended up in flings with several random girls, girls that really were precicely the wrong type for me, and I continued to pine for Julie.  This went on for three whole years.  On again, off again, a seasonal relationship that usually began with a viewing of Titanic and ended with us just ceasing communication for a few months.  Eventually we put aside our differences and tried a real relationship, but because I had grown so accustom to the skewed version, the real thing terrified me and I ended it in a fashion which I am not so happy to repeat.  Let's suffice to say I was a dick and I regret it.   In my defense, she may have been rather nasty about it all too, but I can't remember.  So still I had not found that long-elusive movie romance.  I had been shot down repeatedly like Anthony Michael Hall in some John Hughes film.  I had tasted the bitternes of convienient love with Julie.  I tried my hand after college in a few "adult" relationships which were really just glorified excuses to have sex with another person.  I had begun to think the notion of romance had finally died in me.  Then I met Sarah #3 (Sarah #2 was a girl I messed around with my last week of college, rather insignificant other than her name was Sarah).  Sarah #3 seemed nice, a smart, pretty girl with her head on her shoulders.  What I found was that her head was as far from her shoulders as it could be.  It resided more in a gutter on the side of some dirty Pittsburgh street.  I met Sarah the night she decided to film a porn flick with an ex-boyfriend of hers and a coworker of mine.  I wanted to ask her to leave with me and go get a cup of coffee or something, but instead I said "Would you feel better if I left?"  I looked into her eyes and my heart broke: she looked so.. sad, so confused.  She told me, yes, I should go, but she woudl call me.  I left and suddenly broke into tears.  Never had I met someone so lost.  I decided that I wanted to save her.  Now who the hell am I to save anyone, espcially if they don't want to be saved?  Reguardless, that movie romance rekindled and I set about trying to make Sarah a "respectable woman".  We started seeing eachother and everything seemed brilliant, save for the fact that she found me rather boring.  I guess not being an asshole will do that.  We played the on-and-off game for some time.  I'd spend nights in her bed, she'd pretend we weren't together when we really were.  Eventually, she lost her apartment and I offered mine.  We moved in together.   I figured once we were living together things would get better.  Then she started to bring other guys home.  She let drug dealers deal heroin out of our living room.  I put up with it for a long time, even tried to change her.  But eventually I lost.  I told her I was leaving.  She got angry, told me I was selfish, said I was leaving her high and dry.  She threw a glass at me (it was one of her glasses, but it still hurt like hell).  I told her off, finally and absolutely.  Two weeks later I moved back home with my parents and left her to her own devices.   I havent' talked to her since.  Romance, I had realized, does not exist.  There is no such thing as love at first sight, no one detined individual that, when you meet her, a chorus of emotion rings in your head.   The real world, I figured, simply did not have the capacity for such idealistic notions.  But the story doesn't end here...  RecentlyI had an experience that set my heart in motion once more.  While at a friend's wedding I met Michelle.  I had actually known Michelle for some time, from college, but never really gotten to know her.  We talked about life, love, etc. and had a general great time.  But then something happened.  While listening to her intently I found myself lost in her eyes, mere inches from her face.  Time slowed.   My heart jumped ahead out of sync with the rest of reality.  I had never experienced such a feeling before.  Startled and unsure of what to make of it, I kissed her quickly goodnight and went to find my intoxicated friend to take him home.  I spent the next 48 hours thinking only of Michelle, amazed that I still had the capacity to even consider this sort of attraction.  I've been talking to her since, even visited her, but I still don't know what to make of that moment.  Perhaps I was wrong, maybe romance isn't exiled from our real world after all.  Then again, perhaps my heart is playing tricks on me once more.  After all, I might just be ready to jump off another cliff or learn Russian all over again.  The point is, there is no point.  The only thing a man can do is keep his chin up and not let that cynical little beast get the best of him.  Or hope that someone with a much better head on his neck writes a manual, cause I'm fresh out of ideas.

      So yeah, I'm supposed to be this performer.  Well, supposed to be, only because at some point in time my rational mind figured out that, the way things were, I couldn't support myself on dreams alone, so I started taking random jobs that had very little to do with who I was, or rather who I percieved myself to be.  Some of my jobs (including my most recent one) had to do with gadgets and technology, a not-so-subtle interest of mine which is drawn from a childhood facination with James Bond.  Others were just off the wall strange (working for Catholic Friars?) that had very little to do with me.  But despite my wanderings, I always came back to being an actor to some extent.  But being an actor is not the point.  It's how I STARTED being one.  Cause I realized that even though I now consider it my default, being an actor isn't what anyone (myself included) ever expected me to become.  So often had I pondered what had inspired me to start on such a thing in the first place?   As far as my memory was concerned, never had I said "Mommy, when I grow up I want to be an actor".  I seem to remember saying "Mommy, when I grow up I want to be Indiana Jones", which was indeed cute, but far from being on stage.  And furthermore, I was always a rather shy child who lacked even the ability to ask a salesperson how much that new video game cost, let alone deliver a soliloquy to a group of people hiding in the dark.  But then I realized, all this has something to do with a turtle.  That's right, a turtle.  I was in second grade, no more than 8 years old, and I started down the path that eventually led me to my choice in proffessions (as it were).  See, it was in second grade that I recieved my first part in a play.  As a turtle.   Now the turtle was the most important part.  I think he did something... turtlish, damned if I remember, but it was important, I assure you.  My mom made me a costume with a laundry basket on my back to replicate a shell.  A plastic shell with holes in it.  At least it was green.  But I poured my soul into being that turtle.  I'd like to think I was well recieved.  But that was the first time, and I'm sure that was the moment I started on this dark path.  Now I'm working for a wireless company, years later, trying to turn a theater company that resembles more of a hobby into a real company, and thinking, damn, if I hadn't been that turtle, I might have become a doctor or something.  Gasp.  But you know, the truth of it is, I think being that turtle was one of the best things that ever happened to me.
