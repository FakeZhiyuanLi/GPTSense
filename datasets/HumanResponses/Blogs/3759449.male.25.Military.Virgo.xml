      At first I wasn't sure what to use this thing for. But I think I have figured it out. This is going to be used as a brain dump for plot line ideas. These plot lines will either be used in designing a story for a role-playing game or for writing a novel. Which ever I finally descide on. So if you are reading this and are interested in helping please give your critical opinions. If not then don't.  Thanks

      So now it comes to trying to figure out what kind of non-profit thingy this is going to be. How many fingers in how many pies does it have? What kind of pies? How big is it? How popular? What kind of things would PC's be doing? And of course because we all know that it would happen, what would a ruff and tumble brawler/assasin/punisheresque charcter be doing with this organization? Why would they hire him/her?   But this would also lead into lots of amusing side plots. A character could be a plant from a goverment organization to spy of them and develop a case against them. Maybe an FBI or CIA agent. Heck for that matter an dept of homeland security agent.

      So it looks like my flock of minions is growing. Just kidding. I'm just glad to see that everyone is actually wanting to deal with my dilusions long enough to type comments. That and actually want to correspond with me, even if it is in this format.   Anyway, as Aesteroeth said, evil empire bad. And I think that getting away from the infamous big brother of corporate politics would be a good thing in the begining. I think though that no matter how hard you try you would have to eventually work with or through the non-profit organizations main body which does loook a heck of a lot like a uber-corporation thingy. But then again it would be one of those unavoiable things that we will deal with when we get there.  And the artifact/key thing has always been a favor plot hook. Give PC's a toy and they will play with it. Give them an artifact and they will poke and prod and research and try to figure everything out they can even if it is aparent that they should just get rid of it and tuck tail and run. It is like watching a monkey with a shiny coin.

      What we have so far is the fact that the world base for the game is going to be something allong the lines of modern day with a few tweeks. I am unsure if I want to have supernatural things being publically known like in the Anita Blake and Merideth Gentry Series or hidden like in White Wolf's WOD. But what I do know is that I want to use White Wolf's game system. This is the one that I think encorperates the best game flow, usefull skill types and design, and a good charcter advancement rule set. Although I am waiting until August to figure out if I want to use their new and remade world base, as they are making a new version of all their games to be published I believe around August 21st.  As per Caebral's suggestion, the organization the characters are going to work for is a non-profit organizaion. I am unsure at the perticulars at the moment of what the main purpose of the organization will be or how it is going to be set up. But then again if I knew that then I wouldn't need this site now would I.  It also is still to be seen as to what the main plot of this story will be. I want something dark and horrorish. My prefered genre recently for role-playing games is more of the dark, mystery, horror, semi-fantasy type storylines. For that matter I have been reading Lovecraft recently so don't be surprised if I throw some Cthulu into things as well. But then again that is the dark, mystery, horrow genre isn't it.

      It dawned on me that I know very little about charity organizations like the Red Cross. And thus I guess it might work for characters to be working for one of those. I'm just not exactly sure what kind of organization it would be and what kind of work it would do. And since Caebral is the only person so far to comment on this page I will address this to him and hopefully everyone else can fill stuff in as well.   How does a charity organization/humanitarian organization/non-govermental organization work in the first place?   What kinds of things do they do?  Why would they imploy people who would be PC's?  What kind of "missions" would these PC's do to work them into the story line before they find out that there is a conspiracy and corruption?  And finally yes I admit I was wrong. I didn't even think about the charity thing because I don't know anything about it. But with a little research and some help I think that it will work itself out.

      As caebral has suggested? I'm not sure why a charity organization would hire anyone that would remotely be like anything your average PC would play. And that is probably why I didn't think of it. Although it could work.  and thanks for the comment about the picture. I know that the wonders of Washington allow for many to see such chalk drawings but I thought that I was, in my lowly opinion, good and interesting. That and I just figured out how to put pictures on this site and I was playing. Although I still haven't figured out how to get one in my profile. Not that I have any intention on putting anything that looks remotely like me in that position. I wouldn't want to scare anyone.  anyway, I was actually thinking about a scientific research foundation. If you've read angels and demons then you would know about the CERN foundation in the novel. Whether or not that foundation really exists I'm not sure at this point but I plan on doing some research on it to find out.(Research that I just did. And yes CERN does exist. And it is a physics research organizaion thing. But if you want to know more then look at theit website.)But that way it isn't a corporation that is all about the almighty dollar but rather one that is all about the geeky new discovery. That would give good reason for a variety of experts and fields that characters could play and know about. Ranging from the basic three(chemistry, biology and physics) to more humanity oriented anthropology, archeology and history. But then again this smacks of a "heartless" corporation. But it wouldn't have to be. The scientists would have a genuine interest in their work. It would only be the foundation's Board of whatever's that would be corrupt. And then it might only be one or two of them. This would produce a not so total and overwhelming corrupt giant.   That and a scientific foundation wouldn't necessarily be as likely to bail characters out at the drop of a hat if they get stupid. That is unless they are going to risk making the foundation look bad. And then they would have to face consequences or even getting fired.  I'm not sure. But I think that this would be easier. Unless someone could find a way of making a charity organization work? If you are confused by now that means that you didn't read caebrals comment on "Typing again..." Just go and read it and this might make more sense.

      You would be surprised how often you can find yourself with nothing to do on a break. And when you have internet on a computer in front of you what else is there to do.  Anyway.  I was thinking about having a large corporate entity who the main characters work for. I know this has been done before but I can't figure out anything but the normal run of the mill you work for a corporation, the corporation sends you on jobs, the corporation turns out to be corrupt, you run for your lives, you try and infiltrate and destroy the corporation, you find out that the conspiracy goes deeper then the corporation, etc...  But then again it works. And it allows for multiple main characters with different backgrounds to work together without any far flung reasons other then they both got hired.   It also allows for a wide variety of characters depending on how the world base is set up. If the world has magic and or supernatural creatures then the corporation could be researching supernatural or magical things.   And this could follow multiple different avenues. It has built in spin off plots and side-stories.  What do you think?

         Here is what I've gotten to far. My basic idea is built off of a simple world. It is basically earth and now. Nothing spectacular about it yet. I figured start with the basics. Now if I ever do make this plot line into a role-playing storyline then I will probably be using White Wolf's system. But considering their new version doesn't come out until late august I'm not going to be all that conserned about rule systems right about now. Anyway I'm not even sure where I want to take this ultimately. I was thinking something along the lines of the following genres or a combination of them: private detective, horror, fantasy. Yes I know I've pretty much described the basis for White Wolf and Chithulu. And no I'm not sure right now how to spell that. I am in the middle of a lunch break in the middle of a class. Anyway I am rambling.    Currently I am working on the assumption that I am going to ultimately make this into a game storyline because it would be easy to convert it into a novel after the fact instead of vice-versa. And thus I need ideas to start me off. Something interesting. But first I need a good reason why a bunch of random people would work together in the first place. And not some lame you walk into a bar and there is a help wanted poster... The one thing I would like to avoid is the hack and slash of DnD junkies. Not that there is anything wrong with DnD or hack and slash but I am not currently interested in writing about it.

        Here is what Misha said for the organization. I like the idea for the mission statement. But the name sounds more like a corporation then a charity. But this is a great start. And I think Misha is on the right track. Now we just need to flesh it out. And no Aesteroth you cannot be the CEO. But then again maybe you can...   Just so you know I am going to try and change the color on the parts of the text that I have changed. So if some of the text is a funny color then that means that it was changed. If you want to see the orignial text of what Misha sent then find his comment on  urlLink http://faylenspack.blogspot.com/2004/07/non-profit-org-questions.html#comments  and there you go.

      This isn't to replace the other idea but more like another line of thought.    This runs along the same idea as a game that I started but never finished.  The entire premise of this other idea is that one of the characters has an old uncle that dies. This uncle owned a PI service which is given to the PC. Said PC is in dire straights when it comes to financial status.  And thus the character is drawn into the entire mess. In my original the PI firm had a silent partner. This partner hired the other PC's and tells them to show up for their interview and begining of work on the same day that the first PC is rummaging through the old notes and papers of the Firm. This produces interesting problems. Obviously.    I will continue with the line of thought when I get more time.

      If you check my last posting this will make sense. I think that I am going for idea number one. At least i think it was #1. Anyway, its the one that is the characters chasing the "fool". That way if they are quick on the draw with the detective work they might actually catch up to the "fool".  So currently I figure that there are two introductions to be written up. One is the character introduction to the game. This is a bit more complicated. I like to have individual intros so that the characters have a better and more indiviualized idea of where there characters were at and where they were going before the campaign takes off.  The other intro is the work up on of where the "fool" was and where he went up to the begining of the game. And then into where he is now and where he is going.  I figure that the end result of the first one is the characters being hired and/or brought into the pc detective firm somehow. This could be very generic or very specific depending on the characters themselves. The only on the would be rock solid would be the intro for the main pc which would inherit the firm in the first place. I only call that pc the "main" one because it is the only one which is semi-controlable plotline wise at this point. This character is however not the main focus of the game.

      Well I was thinking about the story line. The second one. And I came up with two different ideas. Both have a similar premise, which is that the "fool" is a archeology or anthropology professor which stumbles upon something ancient. This while an old, and well used plot is always good for most things. That and I can't figure out anyway to do this without bringing in some ancient evil wanting to destroy the world. I mean lets get serious. What else is there in the role-playing world besides ancient evils. Any new evils will get spanked out of the way by the older ones who are already in line to destroy/rule/change/eat the world. And thus I think that this is a good place to start. Anyway...  The first idea is that the main PC's pi firm (as stated in previous postings) is hired to investigate a missing persons case. The missing person is the professor. Said professor is on a chase to find the truth behind this find. Unfortunately, the "truth" is going to unlock/awaken/start the chain of events which will end in some unforeseen but apparently bad way.  The second idea is that the PC pi firm is brought in to investigate the death of the professor by an insurance company. This is the same as the first idea but only after the fact. The characters will be hunting for clues as to what happened instead of chasing after the professor finding what happened in his wake.  Anyway this entire plot is based off the premise that the major arcana from standard tarot cards is a road map of events/people that have to take place/be put in position to bring about something. This might be technically incorrect as to the original purpose of the tarot. But I figure that it can be explained away by the same kind of logic as santeria. Santeria is a voodoo like religion that was made when Catholics came to the islands. The natives adapted their religion to make it sound like they were worshiping catholic religions while still worshiping their pagan gods. They used saints names to represent the gods etc etc. And with that in mind the cult or people or what ever that started this could have used tarot as a way to show the progression of the prophesy without letting the common occultist in on it.

						   I had this idea for creating a blog and doing it like a continuous story about a guy. Something like a novel but at a day by day blow. Or more specifically a scene by scene format. I'm not sure how tht would turn out. But I think it sounds like a good thing to try. So if you see another blog attached to my profile then that is what it will be. Unless of course it is a test page for making adjustments to templates to see if they work. But then again that would be named something more like test or work in progress or something more appropriately stupid like that.

						   I know its been a while since I wrote on this particular blog. But then again I write only sporadically on my other one. So you really can't complain. Not that anyone ever looks at these sites anyways. So I figured that I would drop a line in for no apparently good reason. This also is a warning. I'm probably going to be writing a lot more in about a week. Fun fun fun.
