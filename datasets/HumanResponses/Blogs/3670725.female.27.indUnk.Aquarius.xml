      don't stay away this place was meant to be yours  the price you pay cannot be meant to be yours  freedom is here if it's anywhere  between you and i never a lie  room for everything room to be  you and me just you and me

      you say she asked you to do this with an open heart i see she did not know you yet   i'd like to see you try to do it without an open heart   my love, our hearts are stuck on open   sometimes a blessing sometimes a curse   an infinite capacity for love there's always room for more   i'm learning that also means  there's always a vacancy   in this emptiness i am and here i am alone   and it is so sad my heart breaks in the silence   the knots will untie themselves as you say   trite, but true   it's in the living, i've heard when you live the questions you live your way into the answers   when will i learn to sit with this emptiness this vacancy in my heart and not shake   how can emptiness  ever be anything other?

      this is supposed to be my homework she asked me if i could just try to do this with an open heart   has my heart been closed?   what do i think?  what do i feel?  what do i know?  ask I : why does it matter?  and what if im so tangled that i do not have the answers to these questions?  the knots will untie themselves  sounds trite  feels that way too

      it enters slowly i can feel it c r e e p i n g  in   a shift in my heart rate a rythm from within  internal thermometers gone awry a soured smile eyes can only cry  this pain is from  a different time a different place the black and blues are on my heart but not my face  a day that infected me with shame and guilt and hate i was just a child  all this love...may have come to late....

      you ask why i perch inside this guilded cage you look at me with a thousand eyes and i move closer but say nothing   like a dandelion born to a summer day i must surrender to the wind flying free in the depths in another dimension amoung the lovers   look now, open your eyes you  are  here too
