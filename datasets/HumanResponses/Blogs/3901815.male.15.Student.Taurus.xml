      Wilco's new album, A Ghost Is Born is a fantastic art-rock-country-cum-alternative album, and it has overthrown Slipknot's Vol. 3 as my favorite record of 2004. Jeff Tweedy and company have produced a wonderfully sparse musical landscape, and spread it over 67 minutes. I love this album!      In other news: ............................well, nothing much has been happening in my case. I've just been listening to Wilco continuiously (AgIb and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot), and strumming on my guitar not so quietly in my house. The play ended, and we had a pretty successful run. It was magic in the making.  That's all for now. Catch you all later!  ---Ben B. Mood: Happy. Listening to: Wilco - Live At The Vic Theatre In Chicago Thought: "mmm....now I know the meaning of the words Country Feedback......*in joke alert!*..."

      The first performance in the play was tonight, and, according to other people, I did a great job. I seriously doubt it very much, since I am not that great of an actor. I can only shout at the top of my lungs, and that's about it.&nbsp; No other accents, all I can do is shout. Kinda sucks, knowing that I can't break out of the stereotypical shouting character.   I've learned 3 new songs for the guitar! Smoke On The Water, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Heartbreaker! Go me! I'm getting better everyday.  Wow, it's hot here in Washington. High today was like 97. Crazy how we live in the Pacific Northwest, yet it feels like California. Someones fallen asleep at the weather controls.  Got nothing much else to say...shout outs to Ashlee, Jimmy, Allison, Ally, Steven, Ben, Ben, Tom and the rest of the cast in the play! Great job, guys!  ---Ben B, who heard the London is drowning, and he lives by the river. Mood: Happy Listening to: The Clash - London Calling Thought: I suck at acting.

      The play is in a week. I'm nervous as all hell. I still suck ass at guitar. UT2004 has made me a believer in&nbsp; the power of graphical superiority (until I play Doom 3 that is). Umm....I'm single? &nbsp; I really have nothing else to say....now I do. Adam is in New Jersey. Goddamit, I wanted him to come over. But now that he's on the other side of the U.S., theres just no way thats gonna happen, now is there? &nbsp; Yeah...that's&nbsp;about it. &nbsp; ---Ben B. Mood: Cool Listening to: Blur - The Best Of Thought: "Whoo-hoo."

      Another good day, I reckon.  Although nothing really came of today's play practice (haven't been doing much for a week now), I did play a witch for about 30 minutes. It was kinda fun, but I was playing a girl part...again.  For those who don't know, I played a cross-dressing German maid, and I played Curley's wife in a scene from Of Mice And Men in English class. Funny, cause the girls cheered at me after I played that role (maybe they pity me). I guess you can say I've become accustomed (sp?) to playing a woman.  LAN party at my house in just a few days! I'm so excited! I'm actually having 2 partys this summer, the LAN party, and a cast party for the people in the play. Fun fun fun.  That's about all for now. So, catch you all later! ---Ben B, who's going to Wichita, far from this opera forevermore. Mood: Happy Listening to: White Stripes - Elephant Thought: "Who wants a body massage?"

      That's only ONE thing I talked about today. ONE. There are many more things that me and my friends talked about.  So...we also talked about, lesbians, transexuals, coconuts, dogs humping, cats having sex, pedophiles (umm...wrong), Johnny Depp, POTC set pieces, web comics....yeah, we are some truly disturbed individuals, eh?  I'm terminally addicted to UT2004. I can't stop playing it...it beckons me to touch it, stroke it, frag 20 guys at the same time with an Ion cannon...mmm....yes.  Practiced my guitar a bit, yes. No, I still suck.  I FINALLY GOT FIGHT CLUB BACK! It's been 2 weeks but Adam finally returned it! I'm a happy clam.  That's about all the news bout me that I've got. So, see you all later. Stay cool.  ---Ben B., prince of pr0n and PWNage. Mood: Happy Listening to: Velvet Underground - Loaded Thought: "Pimpin fruitcakes on rollerskates!"

      Hey, everybody? What's up. Nothing much here. This is what you could call my "news/journal/random musings" page, or blog. It's pretty cool, actually. I mean, I like it a lot. I no longer have to use my homepage to report news about myself. It's great...saves space...yeah.  It's Sunday, and nothing much happened today, so theres not much to talk about. So, bye for now.  Keep checking in for more posts as the week progresses. Stay cool!  ---Ben Mood: Happy Listening to: R.E.M. - Automatic For The People Thought: "Ummm....clams?"

      The Who - Live At Leeds is hereby the best live album ever commited to tape. Nuff said.  UT2004 still owns my soul.  I'm going to PAX.  And I wrote my first song.  Wow.  ---Ben B. Mood: Distracted Listening to: Tool - Lateralus Thought: *sorry, gotta run*
