      I went to the water park yesterday with my family.  It was about a 2 hour drive, which wasn't bad.  The bad part came when we got there.  I don't really get the point of going to amusement parks and stuff like that.  Its always crowded, it's either really hot or really rainy, or some extreme, it can never be nice weather.  And people seem to become stupider by every foot they get into the park.   My biggest problem, was the sun.  My hated advisary.  I always wear shoes.  It might seem an odd peice of information, but it will be importent in a minute.  I was trying to get a tan, im tired of being so white im transparent.  Well, since I don't wear shoes, there whiter then the rest of me, and if a bit to lazy to put on sunscreen all the way down there.  I was trying to tan, and I fell asleep.  I didn't notice the effects until later that night, man, it burns.  It still burns.   Heres a tip, never scratch a bad sunburn. Youll regret it, forever.

      Latley ive been very busy. My sisters getting married in 2 weeks and were the ones doing everything, theres no outside help, so anything thats getting done is getting done by me and my family. Also, I just picked up Doom III, and a few new pairs of adult diapers.  Before you think what I know your thinking, its because of Doom. It is the scaryist videogame I have ever played. The graphics feel and look so lifelike, it's scary. The way the game just grabs you and sucks you into it is absolutley amazing. When you mix in the sounds, forget about it. Your no longer you, your a marine on mars, trying to escape with your life. And thats just from walking around in the game. Needless to say, the monstors poping out of the walls, or the blood on the walls just sweetens the experience oh so much more.  Ive also been studying for a hunter saftey course, so I can go hunting with my sisters Fiance. Thats tommarow, and im trying to finish almost the entire book in one night. Luckily, i know most of the stuff, I just have to finish the questions.  Im off to go work on the book, so ill post later with something with more substance.

      This last wenisday, I was was at a rally for president Bush in my home town of Davenport. Only blocks away from this rally was John Kerry, holding an invite only summit. Does that make sense to you? You would think you would get more votes by speaking to a crowd of 13,000 then a room full of 100 snooty rich people. Its just plain commen sense.  The fact that it didn't make sense to me wasn't the most disturbing part. The most disturbing part was when i was walking the half mile walk back to the parking lot. There were a crowd of Kerry suporters just outside the gates set up around the park where the rally was held. They wanted to talk to us about our choice in political party. Those guys were fine. When I got a little further down the sidewalk there was a group of people yelling at an old guy who was handing out pro-bush flyers. They had signs saying "get rid of facism, get rid of bush" and it had a big swastica on the poster. While I was looking at the poster, a man with a rather scruffy beard holding a baby walk up to the old man handing out flyers. He started yelling out things like "YOU ARE A CRIMINAL" and "THERES A POLICE OFFICER, HE SHOULD ARREST YOU, OFFICER ARREST THIS MAN, HE IS A CRIMINAL." and "HISTORY WILL PROVE THAT WE WERE RIGHT". I wanted to walk up to one of them and ask "If you were in Bush's posistion, what would you have done? Not just 'Don't go to war', but what would you do exactly?" I would bet that none of them could answer it. Most of them don't really think about what would have been better, it's just anybody but Bush.  It's sad to think that the future of this country rests in the hands of people like that.
