        Apparently Democrats are as big of cowards as I thought they were, since no one posting negative comments have left their name - no, rather they hide behind anonymous. So, from now on, this blog will no longer allow anonymous comments.  So, unless you want to have an intelligent conversation, don't leave pointless comments.

         Attention:         The following posts were removed from this site becuase of technical errors within the blogging system. These posts were NOT removed becuase I no longer believe them.       1.) Member of Kerry's Legal Team Faces Legal Trouble            --> Blog about member of Kerry's legal team picking up a prostitute.       2.) Kerry's Past Finall Catches Up With Him            --> Post in reference to Kerry's falsified Vietnam recollections.       I will try and re-post them once I figure out what went wrong.       -Todd

       I realize that everyone these days doesn't have much time, so as the helpful person I am, I am posting this sample ballot so everyone will know what to do on  November 2  (yes that's right folks- November 2 is election day so mark it down in your appointment books under "Voting For Bush")  Sample Ballot November 2, 2004  President of the United States of America  ___ John "Longface" Kerry ___ Ralph "Denied Spaces On Some Ballots because Democrats Are Desperate" Nader   _X_ George W. Bush      Any questions?  Still not convinced? Let's have a look at a few highlights of each candidate...   John Kerry:  A.) Lied about being in Cambodia on Christmas Day... so much for being "seared" into his memory B.) Is so afraid he is going to lose this election that he is working to prevent an independent Ralph Nader from getting on the ballot. If he doesn't want the constitution held up, where any man should be able to run, do you want him as your next President? C.) Flip-flops on most issues. The list is endless folks...   Ralph Nader:  A.) Not a Democrat and not a Republican...where does that leave him ? B.) Second best choice- if for some unconceivable reason you can't vote for Bush, then vote Nader (unless of course you live in a state that the Democrats have succeeded in denying Mr. Nader basic constitutional rights...then don't vote for anyone)   George W. Bush:  A.) Has tracked down and fought a large majority of the terrorists responsible for MURDERING thousands of Americans on September 11th. B.) Increased government funding to schools so we can help improve future generations of Americans. C.) Increased our military so that we can fight those who wish to threaten our nation. This list also continues with hundreds more reasons a vote for Bush is a vote for America.  So... let me sum this up for you in one sentence:     ON ELECTION DAY, LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD WHEN YOU VOTE GEORGE W. BUSH BACK INTO OFFICE FOR FOUR MORE YEARS OF STONG LEADERSHIP!

        In these times of a fiercely spilt America on politics, it's always good to see a story about good old citizens helping each other. Since Hurricane Charley's visit to Florida a week ago, citizens have been out in force, helping residents who have lost everything. See the full story on Yahoo!   urlLink  http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20040821/ap_on_re_us/charley_good_samaritans&amp;e=3

       Ok... So this is my first post on this blog. I live in Virginia and I'm a big Bush supporter. I'll write more later, but for now pass this site on to friends. I am more than happy to talk to people from both sides of the political spectrum as long as your respectful. So check back later. -Todd

       Everytime I get wind of Michael Moore's latest antics, my blood just boils. So, due to my recent bout of insomnia, I foolishly went to Michael Moore's website and what do you know...the blood started boiling! So he has this list of what he says are "facts" (and I use that word VERY loosely) that are presented in his so-called movie Farenheit 911. Anyway...so here's the first fact he has listed:     FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush. Before that, some other networks had called Florida for Gore, and they changed after Fox called it for Bush.       Todd:   What? I'm sorry what's that you say? Why yes, last I checked the news networks didn't decide who is elected to office, the people do! What a shocking surprise!    Let's continue down his list, and mind you that was just the first one.     FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   Gore got the most votes in 2000.       Todd:   Can someone call hell and see if it froze over?! Michael Moore got something partially correct. I'm more than willing to tell you that Gore won the popular vote, but Bush won the Electoral College, which is the deciding factor in United States Presidential Elections.  So get over it! Life's too short to hold grudges.        So back to his "facts"    FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   “On the day George W. Bush was inaugurated, tens of thousands of Americans poured into the streets of D.C. They pelted Bush’s limo with eggs.”    Todd:   Could this be a new trend? Now, can someone explain to me why Michael Moore would choose to include this? All it shows is that Democrats are sore losers and very disrespectful to the President. Can you imagine how the Democrats would react if someone threw an egg at John Kerry's limo? All hell would break loose. Such hypocrisy. By the way...he states as his fact (see above) that "They pelted Bush's limo with egg s ." Notice that pluralness on eggs. Now let's take a look at the facts HE PROVIDED to back up this statement:      “Scuffles erupted between radicals and riot police while an egg struck the bullet-proof presidential limousine as it carried Mr. Bush and wife Laura to the White House.” Damon Johnston, “Bush Pledges Justice as Critics Throw Eggs,” The Advertisers, January 22, 2001.      AN EGG! AN EGG! Michael Moore caught in ANOTHER LIE! Will it ever end??!!?!!    Ok well Im beat so I'm going to bed now..but rest assured there is more to come...    Todd

       I know this news story was released on August 5, but I was on vacation then so I'm going to talk about it now. Here's the link:   urlLink  http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/05/kerry.911/     So the basic premise is that Kerry attacked Bush's response on 9/11 saying that he should have left as soon as his aide gave him news, rather than waiting a whole 5 - 7 minutes. Kerry was quoted as saying "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to -- and I would have attended to it." Ok Mr. Kerry let's get some things straight pal. First off, the top aide did  not  say that America was under attack. Bush was told that airplanes had flown into the World Trade Centers and at that point it was considered a horrible accident not a terrorist attack. Now let's give Kerry the benefit of the doubt and say that his top aide did whisper " America is under attack." Now it would have been bad for the President not to leave immeadieatly, but honestly would five minutes make a large difference against a well orchestrated band of terrorists who had been planning this attack for years? Now let's not even get into the fact that this attack would never had happened had Clinton taken Osama out when given the chance, no he was too busy with Monica to care about such trivial things.  Enough of my ranting for tonight (or I guess this morning now) So I'm off to bed.  Todd
