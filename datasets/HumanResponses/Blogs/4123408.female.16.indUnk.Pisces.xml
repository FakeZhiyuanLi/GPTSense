       urlLink    This is where I want to go more than anywhere else in the world - the Grand Canyon in Arizona. I know it's one of those places most people want to go but it's so beautiful - especially at sunset which is what I really want to see!

       urlLink    Me and Tom went to the Birmingham Art Gallery and I found a postcard with this painting on in the gift shop (we must have missed it walking round....) and I think it's gorgeous! It's really bright and energetic and unique as the painting is split over 3 seperate canvases. It's called A Midsummer Night and is painted by Gillian Ayres.

      I wanted to post my favourite poem - 'The Love Song Of J.Alfred Prufrock' but it is way too long. So instead I leave you with another one of my favourites also by T.S.Eliot - 'The Naming Of Cats'.....................  The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isn't just one of your holiday games; You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES. First of all, there's the name that the family use daily, Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey-- All of them sensible everyday names. There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter, Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames: Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter-- But all of them sensible everyday names. But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular, A name that's peculiar, and more dignified, Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular, Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride? Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum, Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat, Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum- Names that never belong to more than one cat. But above and beyond there's still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover-- But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess. When you notice a cat in profound meditation, The reason, I tell you, is always the same: His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name: His ineffable effable Effanineffable Deep and inscrutable singular Name.

       urlLink    Another one from Van Gogh though this one is less famous - 'Caf√© Terrace at Place du Forum'. I like this one because it's very colourful and reminds me of where we stayed in Italy when we went snowboarding. Plus it's at night and you may have noticed I like the night sky :)

       urlLink    This is my favourite painting possibley of all time. Starry Night is probably Vincent Van Gogh's most famous painting and is instantly recognizable by it's unique style. I really want to go to the New York Museum Of Modern Art so I can see it for myself.....

      Have you ever met a  happy emo kid ? I have - it scared me. I was thinking 'no way is she emo then. she's just following the trend with the look'. It annoys me when people do that though - try and fit into a group they don't belong in. They should just be themselves. There are so many stupid contradictions in terms that some people come out with. It's mad. Like 'I'm going to  get you back, but in a good way ' - how does that work? And how can you have a  love/hate relationship ? It just makes no sense. How can you be ' alone together ' too? I swear this world is just full of oxymorons - it's crazy. One more crazy thought though - why is a boxing  ring ,   actually  square ? Like I said, the world is made of contradictions.
