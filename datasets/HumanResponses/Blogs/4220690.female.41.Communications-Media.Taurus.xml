      We had talked since our first meeting, online of course. Just two days after that eventful day, we made arrangments to meet at his house on a Sunday afternoon. His wife would be at work. They only had one car and he took her to work, so we wouldn't be interrupted. I was so excited and incredibly horny. He met me at the door and the second it was closed behind me, he pushed me against it and smothered my mouth with a crushing, deep kiss. When he finally released me from his kiss, he took my hand and led me into the bedroom. Very slowly he began to undress me. He took off my dress, then stopped to marvel at my huge breasts. He told me they were the biggest, softest, most beautiful he'd ever seen. He rubbed his thumb across my nipples and was pleased when they were instantly hard. He deftly took off my bra in one quick motion, then buried his face in my bosom. He took each nipple in his mouth and suckled at my breast. It was a wondrous feeling. He alternated between my nipples until they were both standing at attention and aching for more. He'd suck on them, rolling them with his tongue and nipping at them gently with his teeth. Then he'd pull back and gently blow them dry with his breath, then start all over again. I nearly came from his skillful manipulations, and he hadn't even touched the lower half of my body. When he saw that I was getting shaky from his activities he very gently laid me on the bed and slowly, very slowly, peeled off my underwear, all the while telling me how beautiful I was. He didn't dive right in, as I had expected. Instead he joined me in bed and kissed me some more. He let me undress him and explore his body. I enjoyed his nipples much the way he had enjoyed mine and it was my pleasure to see him respond. Only then did he start working his way down my body, kissing and licking every inch of the way. When he got to my pussy, he pushed my thighs apart oh-so-gently and took his time exploring the area. He kissed all the way around my tender, now swollen, parts. He blew hot air on my clit and watched my reaction. Then he moved his mouth to my dripping hot hole. I can't begin to describe the magic that took place at that moment. He was quite simply an absolute master at the art of cunnilingus. He licked and sucked alternately until I thought I would go mad. Just when I thought I would die if he didn't enter me, I felt the sweet sensation of his fingers moving inside me.  Deep  inside me. He touched places inside me that I didn't even know existed. My body convulsed as the explosion ripped through me. I had never in my life felt anything so intense. Having satisfied me so thoroughly, he kissed his way back up to my mouth and covered it with his, letting me taste my own cum. I wanted him inside me NOW and begged him to fuck me. He grabbed a condom and searched for the perfect position to enter me. It didn't take him long, but he apparently had an aversion to latex and was quickly deflated. He was frustrated. He didn't like condoms and neither did his pecker. I told him it didn't matter, and proceeded to suck him dry. I loved the way his cock felt in my mouth. I enjoyed having the power to make him cum. I left that day a happy woman, but wondered if there was something wrong with me that he couldn't stay hard long enough to fuck me. I wondered if there would be another chance, or if he'd had all he wanted of this piece of tail. I was getting hooked and I didn't know what to do to stop it...or if I wanted to. All I knew is that I would have spent the rest of my life having him go down on me, even if I never got to feel his dick inside me. As long as his tongue could work his wondrous brand of magic on my yearning cunt, and I could feel his manhood explode in my mouth, I could be happy with that.

      We met on the internet. It's so cliche now, but back then, it was novel. I admit, I was looking for excitement. I believe the exact words on my profile were that I was looking for someone to "rock my world".   He wasn't the first one to respond. The first was Seth. He was 12 years my junior, just 21 years old, and married. He too was looking for a one night stand. We talked for a couple of nights then we decided to meet late one night to consummate our internet flirtation. His wife was out of town, so we met at his house. He was cute. He was impressed with my big boobs. I was less than impressed with what he had to offer. There was no oral sex, which was a personal favorite of mine. One kiss and some breast fondling was the extent of the foreplay. It was over in minutes. Criminies, I'd only been with one man my whole life and I knew more about sex than this guy! The experience left me feeling empty and used. This was not what I was looking for, although I didn't really know what I was looking for! Suffice it to say, my world was NOT rocked.  The following week it was Scott. A little older than Seth, but only only by two or three years. He was funny and made me laugh. We decided to give it a whirl. I picked him up in my van when he was supposed to be going to the gym. At least that's what he told his wife. We decided to find a quiet place to park, and well, have sex. I was distressed because I had started my period earlier in the day. He told me it was no big deal. We drove around for awhile until we found what we thought was the perfect spot. We got in the backseat and he went to town on my boobs. He didn't want oral sex. He just wanted  inside  me. That's when I realized he had the smallest dick I had EVER seen, even on TV or in magazines. It was so thin...about the width of a magic marker. I wasn't even sure he was IN me. Then came the knock on the window. Yes, it was the wonderful county sheriff's office. After humilating us for about 20 minutes, they let us off with a warning. This experience scared the bejesus out of me. I refused to answer his calls and his instant messages. I wasn't sure this was what I wanted to do anymore. He became threatening and I was certain I didn't want to continue anything with him. This was just scary, not exciting and definitely not the kind of world rockin' I was looking for.  A few weeks later, I chatted with Bill. He was couple of years older than me, married and very experienced. He bragged that he had been cheating his entire 10 year marriage and had gotten very good at it. I liked his confidence and his bravado. On the spur of the moment, we decided to meet at a local fleabag motel, something I had never done. He told his wife he had to pick up a friend who'd had too much to drink. He was no amateur, that was for sure. This was a better experience than the first two. He was a weightlifter and had a very nice, muscular body. He rode a Harley had very cool tattoos. He knew I was shy so he took the lead. He started with a kiss (just one) and slowly worked my clothes off. He kissed his way down my body, right to my waiting, wet pussy. He worked at my muff until I came all over his face. He wasn't terribly talented in that area, it was just the first time in a very long time any man had tasted me, and my pussy was way past ready. When it was my turn to pleasure him, I grabbed his rather large penis with both hands and started working my way down it's sides, making curliques with my tongue. I could hear his breathing get more shallow as became excited. I took all of him in my mouth at once and began stroking with my mouth and my tongue. I felt him get harder in my mouth. Just when I thought he was going to explode, he grabbed me and threw me on the bed, on all fours....my favorite. With one quick manuever he was positioned behind me and thrust deep inside me. He reached forward and cupped my breasts as he plugged away. It didn't take long before he shot his load and collapsed on top of me. We laid in bed for quite awhile afterwards talking and caressing. He talked candidly about his wife, his numerous conquests, etc. We decided on one quick encore performance, then got dressed to go home. This time I went home more or less satisifed. Still not whole, but satisfied. He had made it exceptionally clear that this would be a one time only tryst. Since I didn't really feel anything for him other than good old fashioned lust, that was fine. It's hard to rock someone's world in just one night.  Then, the next week, I met   him  . He sent me a message that he could definitely rock my world. I had heard this about a hundred times before and it made me giggle. All men think they are gods in bed. But he intrigued me. He was intelligent, funny and knew how to talk dirty, without being disgusting and/or insulting. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he lived nearby and really could try to make good on his promise to "rock my world". We made arrangements to meet briefly the next day. I was at work when I first laid eyes on him. My boss was out of town and had left me in charge of the office. It was positively dead during the day, so I knew it would be a safe place to meet. I remember trying to concentrate on reading the paper to make the time go by faster. Thankfully, he was prompt. I was so nervous to see what he actually looked like. He walked in the door and immediately locked the door behind him. This normally would have spooked me, but I was so mesmerized by his stunning good looks that I barely noticed. He was quite simply the most beautiful man I had ever seen. He literally took my breath away. He was of Asian descent and I  would later learn he was half Japanese, half Scottish. He had gorgeous thick, wavy black hair sprinkled with gray, and a nicely trimmed mustache and beard. His beautiful bedroom eyes were a deep, warm, chocolate brown. He had near perfect teeth, straight and almost movie-star white. His lips were full and pouty and incredibly sensuous. I couldn't wait to kiss them. His body wasn't perfect, but I loved what I saw. Long waisted with just a slight belly. Strong muscular thighs. He was 6'2" and towered over my 5'1" frame. He crossed the short distance between us and kissed me lightly on the lips. He handed me the rose he had brought me. Still lost in his male beauty, I pulled him close for a deeper kiss. His tongue instantly probed and explored my mouth, darting in and out of the crevices without being too invasive. I had to break for air because I was becoming lightheaded. His hand traveled to my breasts and I could feel the heat of his touch. He asked me to sit down and steered me to my desk chair. He knelt down in front of me. He pushed my dress up to my waist. His hand caressed my breasts for a moment then traced it's way down my body until I could feel him fingering my panties, and he smiled to find that they were already wet. He stroked my wetness through my panties for a minute or two, commenting on how my pussy must be happy to see him.  He pushed the thin material aside and plunged his fingers into my aching pussy. With his thumb he caressed my clit as he continued to massage my pussy walls with his fingers. I can't remember even being capable of thought at this point. I'd never felt such intense pleasureable sensations. He was patient and it was obvious he enjoyed this task. He murmured titillating phrases about the things he wanted to do to me. He told me how hot and wet my pussy was, and how he loved the way my sex smelled. I could barely catch my breath. He continued to fingerfuck me, slowly increasing the gentle, rhythmic pressure on my hot button. Every fiber of my being wanted more. I wanted him inside me, and soon. Finally I exploded in a cresendo of exquisite pleasure. When I could breathe normally again, I opened my eyes and was greeted by the most beautiful  self-satisfied smile. I knew I  had  to taste him. I wanted the sensation of his cock in my mouth. I wanted to return the same kind of amazing pleasure he had given me. I unfastened his pants and pushed him against the edge of the desk in front of me and I remained seated in my chair. I released his bulging manhood from it's fabric cage. It was a beautiful sight to behold...six and half inches long and at least three inches thick. The skin tone varied and was deeper in color closer to his body. I couldn't wait to taste him! I stuffed as much of him as I could into my hungry mouth. He tasted even better than I could have imagined! His groans of pleasure and his hand stroking my hair, pushing me into his sex, drove me into a frenzy. I simply  had  to make him cum. I worked my tongue up and down the sides of his thick cock. I sucked the shaft from top to bottom. He whispered delectably naughty phrases to me as I serviced him. He had the sexiest damn voice I'd ever heard. I darted my tongue in and out of the little slit at the top. I alternated sucking just the head of his penis and then deep throating as much of him as I could. I cradled his ball sac and massaged it as I sucked and licked. At last my efforts paid off and I was rewarded with the sweet, metallic taste of his cum hitting the back of my throat. When he had recovered, he stood up, fastened his pants and his belt, tucked in his shirt and pulled me into a standing position. He kissed me deeply and told me this was just the beginning. He said he wanted to stay longer but he had to get to work. I walked him to the door, he kissed me one last time and then he left.  Later he recounted to me how he had noticed that his precum had left a stain on the front of his trousers. He'd had to aim the blowers from the car's heater on his pants trying to dry the wet spot before he got to work. I was floating on air, and I couldn't wait to talk to him again. More importantly, I couldn't wait to actually fuck him and feel him moving inside me. I must have masterbated 10 times that day, each time recalling the feel of his cock in mouth and his fingers in my pussy. My world was about to be seriously rocked!

      He called tonight. I haven't talked to him in about a week. I could tell right away that he was horny, which is often when he calls. I'm used to that. Tonight he wanted to talk dirty. He told me that I was good at giving head (I  knew  that). That he loved my big, soft breasts. He recalled the way my legs would stretch all the way out when I came. I get angry at myself because his words excite me. They actually make me wet. I hate that he can pull that type of reaction from me.  Then the wondering starts. We were only together 6 months before he cast me aside. He's been in two relationships since then and they both lasted far longer than ours. Does he call them too and whisper obscene memories in their ears? How does he sort through the memories and assign the proper ones to each of us? I must not have made much of an impact on him since he had absolutely no trouble leaving me behind. He had no qualms about letting me know that they were better in bed. Both of his more recent loves are more beautiful, thinner and younger than me. I can't imagine why he would choose to relive those memories of me, when he's obviously had hotter sex with them. So why does he call me? Because I let him. Because he's throwing me a bone. Because he knows I'm still good for a quick sexual fantasy for him to masterbate to. Because I'm pathetically alone...six years after he kicked me out of his bed.  I thought I'd buried all those sexual memories of him. But when he does this, they all come rushing back. It feels good for a moment to remember how very much in love I was, how special he made me feel, and how mind-blowing the sex was. He made me feel so very sexy, and I was so free with him. Nothing seemed out of bounds, wrong or taboo.  Then, I start remembering the beginning of the end. It came with no warning. Suddenly he didn't feel 'right' sleeping with me. I blame his super religious mom...she was really laying a guilt trip on him about us. But there were other issues...ones that would never be resolved. He was incredibly jealous of the ones who came before him.  It didn't matter that he was the one I wanted to be with now. For three months I slept on the couch. Finally, feeling neglected, unloved and unloveable, I moved out. I wanted him to beg me to stay. He didn't. I know now that by then he had already met his next girlfriend and she had taken my place in his bed within a week of my departure. I was despondent. I had given up everything for him and he had simply cast me aside, as if I were nothing. So great was my need for him, that I became his 'best friend' since I could not be his lover. For 3 years I listened to him agonize over his relationship with the new girlfriend. I picked out presents for her. I spent hours on the phone with him into the wee hours of the night as he obsessed over every nuance of their affair. Since she was married and he was now cast in the role of the 'other man', I substituted...filling his weekends with companionship. I guess I was pretending we were still together, even though I knew it wasn't true. If she called, I was instantly history. If he was on the phone with her, I couldn't let on that I was there. If she was available, then I was immediately kicked to the curb. I have never in my life felt so insignificant, so very unimportant.  Then came the fateful evening when a night cuddling on the couch turned into something much more. I had such hope that now that we had a sexual relationship again, that it would all come back. How very foolish I was! I had became his 'fuck buddy'. He would call me late at night and whisper an obscene invitation. I would be on his doorstep and in his bed in minutes. How he must have laughed at my eagerness! But things weren't the same. There were no kisses, no sweet nothings and naughty laughter, no basking in the afterglow. The sex was rough, to the point, and all for him. Not once in the year that ensued did he go down on me, something he relished doing in the past. After he was through with me, which means as soon as he came, I got dressed and slunk out the door. Like a $10 whore. I felt so dirty, unloved and unwanted. All this time, he was still seeing her. How ironic, that he was now cheating on her, with  me . If only she knew how little it actually had to do with me. It was all about his anger at her for being unavailable. I felt his anger, with every stroke that went too deep, every angry bite on my nipples, every hand-shaped bruise left on my breasts, and every hair that was pulled from my head in the heat of the moment. This was sex at it's worst, and it most certainly was not love. But still, I couldn't stay away. I guess the part of me that remembered the incredible lover that he had once been, just couldn't let go of the hope that he might once again be the lover I once knew and loved.  I tried to move on, desperately. It would take the fingers on both hands to count the number of men I slept with after him. I'm not proud of this...it just is. Trying to erase the memory of how his body felt pressed next to mine. How his tongue could send shivers down my spine. Trying to eradicate the taste and feel of him in my mouth. Trying to drown out the dirty little things he said that drove me wild. He used to tell me how much he loved my body while he was fucking me. He would stop and look at my pussy just before he went down on me and tell me how beautiful it was and how good he knew it was going to taste. The way he would suck my nipples just hard enough to make me squirm, but not hard enough to hurt. I loved they way his belly swelled out just so, softly curved yet rock solid underneath. I adored the power in his thighs that promised deep thrusts and delicious satisfaction. I marveled at the way the skin below his waist was darker than the skin above. I yearned for his kisses that would start at the nape of my neck and trail down my shivering body until they had teased my taut nipples and engulfed my engorged clit. That was before of course. When I meant something to him. When I was more than just a hole or a mouth for him to stick his cock into. The men that came after, none could measure up to my expectations. I had experienced love and raw passion at it's very best. Nothing would ever again be good enough. It didn't help that I chose unattainable, detached partners. Mostly married. I didn't care. I just wanted to feel something again. Something good.  Finally, I did the only thing I could do. I ran away. I transferred with my company to a city three states away. At first he called daily. Especially when he was fighting with the girlfriend. Slowly the calls died down to once a week, then twice a month. Eventually, after four long years, she let him go. I was proud of her. It was everything I hadn't been able to do. She had divorced her husband and had tried to give it a go with her long-time lover (four years!), but he wasn't quite as attractive to her when he wasn't the forbidden fruit. Or maybe it was the other way around. So, since he was depressed and scared of what the future would hold, I once again became his confidante...albeit a long distance one. I encouraged him, reassured him, and even gave him suggestions on putting himself on the market, so to speak. Then the unexpected happened...he came to visit me! After not seeing him for a year and half, I got one and a half days of his company. He played this game of acting like he didn't want to touch me. Perhaps because he knew it was exactly what I wanted. It had been a long time since I'd had an affectionate touch and I was craving some intimacy. Finally, mere hours before he left town, he conceded to let me  touch  him. It seemed like it was almost an afterthought. This quickly led to sex, or his version of it. It was every bit as unimaginative, rough and unloving as it had been the last time we'd had sex, the night before I left town. Not even a kiss or a quasi loving embrace. Then he was gone again.   The very next day, while he was visiting his brother in a nearby city, he met his next girlfriend on a blind date. Fifteen years his junior, she thought he was everything she'd ever dreamed of. Within a month he was telling me he was in love and by the end of the year (just 3 short months after they met) she had moved in. Theirs was a tempestuous relationship. She was impulsive and he was entirely too used to living alone. The difference in their ages came up more often than not. But still he was determined to make it work. Of course I offered advice when he needed a sounding board. Almost a year to the day, she walked out on him. Took everything that wasn't nailed down in the house and left. He was shocked, pissed, hurt....but mostly relieved. Now, they've made up but she hasn't moved back in. They have a long distance relationship. He talks of moving to our state so they can be together. Of course he tells me he mostly wants to move here so he can live closer to me. Except now, I know better than to believe it. It has nothing to do with me. It never did.  Yet he still has the power to make me wet with his words...with the memories. Why do I give him this power? When I least expect it, memories of him leap from the shadows of my mind. Memories of how it felt to have him deep inside me; how he would chuckle over my predilection for 'doggy style' sex; how he'd listen to my fantasies and then try to find ways to turn them into realities. He was the one who discovered I was multi-orgasmic. I can still see that little half grin he would give me right after I had gone into orgasmic convulsions...just before he reached down and started stroking my clit into submission again. He quickly understood that if he'd just wait a minute or two, it wasn't quite so painfully sensitive. He could then lick or stroke my sensitve yet ready pussy until he produced another bed-shaking, sheet-soaking explosion. He said he loved the dreamy expression of sublime pleasure that came across my countenance when he had so fully satisfied me. I can close my eyes and instantly recall that look of utter concentration etched on his face as he rocked back and forth inside me, one hand on the headboard until he launched his seed inside me. I remember how it felt to have his hot cum trickling deep inside of me. It made me feel so complete. How silly that sounds now. I was so incredibly naive and foolish. I actually thought we were meant to be together.    Fairy tales, simply dreams in disguise Beware their Siren call. Like angel wings and lovers' sighs They lift you high, yet let you fall. Trust not those sweet and pretty lies.    Copyright, me 1997  I haven't slept with another man since I moved here 3 years ago. I haven't even dated anyone. I've become a recluse. I've become what I was when I was married...an asexual being. That was the prison he had sprung me from, and ironically it's where I have tunneled myself back into. No one even thinks I would have sex. Least of all me.
