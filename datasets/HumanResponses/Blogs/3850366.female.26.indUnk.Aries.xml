      superman is one tough man.. but this one, not only is he tough  he has a lot of strength (in so many meanings!)  he is up every night.. saving the helpless...  saving (some) people from their loneliness...    one day (or night) i got to talk to him  how he was nice!  from then on... he has always been there..  my company... on my days and his nights..    he is funny!  he is skinny!  he is friendly!  and most of the time.. he is tipsy!    but whatever it is that he does  the important thing for me is that  he is a friend.. to me.. and to don..  it's him...our superIAN..

       my breathlessness is back. just a little bit though. but i went back to exercising too... maybe it's either one or the other. the past week i have been sleeping a lot and i felt better. i feel horrible though thinking that maybe i just have a hard time breathing when i move too much. does that mean i can't go dancing anymore??

      i feel like something is missing. i have never felt the days pass so slow like this. it used to go so fast, i wake up, get on the channel and laugh and laugh... until i have to go do some work, in the late afternoon. i thought i can live without my so called friends. i thought they were just my laugh buddies. but what do i know?     i need them more than i know and think. i feel so alone. so lonely. how can people, such strangers, make me feel so lonely? maybe i am clingy. maybe i am needy. but they do make me happy. i try to be happy with ray as much as i can. but they are different. they just come out spontaneously and make me feel like a true friend. like we all knew each other for the longest time.    so what do i do? i wish i can turn back time. this is one thing that i can say i really regret having done. when i just let them walk away like that. ..

       the first time we talked, we hit it right away. i was laughing, i always  looked forward to another day for a nice funny chat. i was never the  same after that.    he's this funny, happy go lucky, yet very serious kind of person. kind  of complex, if i may say. but who's not? so we became friends, we all  (he, ia, and i) login in everyday and make fun of each other as well as  other people. it's nothing less than a happy and very funny day every  day.   until i got sick. or so we thought. i really have nobody to talk to  around here, that's why i always find happiness with  them two. so  when i thought something was wrong with me, i thought it was just  natural to tell them about it so that i can get over it.    if only he knew. if only he knew how scared i was when he explained to me the gravity of things. it may not be what i was sick with but he did make me understand that if i don't get checked right away and i really was sick, then it may be too late. i knew he cared. like a friend does.     but for whatever reasons, things got out of hand. we are still a bunch of kids trying to enjoy life, say what we want to say and do whatever we wanted to do. he was having fun and i was not. so we all said goodbye. something  that has always been so hard for me to do. saying goodbye. they made me laugh everyday that  it is so hard right now to pass a day without talking to them.    and it is all my fault. if only i said everything's alright. if only i knew how to lower down my pride. if only...

      ~where do i go from here...  this isn't where i intended to be...  or so i thought. but life is more surprising than we always expect it to be. for me, i saw, i came, and i conquered. now here i am making my own life. or what i can make of it, that is.   since i came here all i ever wanted was to go home. see my family. be with my lian. but my life is more than that. now, here i am still.
