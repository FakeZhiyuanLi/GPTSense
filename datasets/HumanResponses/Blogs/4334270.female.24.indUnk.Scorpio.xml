       Since this is my first entry here I'll try to keep myself functioning in normal mode. This means that there will be fewer random thoughts thrown out at inappropriate times. That's not a promise to stay good however ;) I will undoubtedly show my bad side at some time or another.       This is my expressive outlet. This is where I will share some of my many secrets with you outsiders. Outsiders is a term that I will apply to everyone at this point. No one knows me as I know myself. There are parts of myself that I don't even want to know so I keep them hidden from everyone, especially from myself. I just keep them locked in special rooms in my mind where the only times the door is unlocked is when I visit them, however infrequently. I don't fear their escape anymore because the years have honed my ability to know when security may be lax and to take extra precautions. They also have fewer opportunities to escape now that I know how they try to escape.       Ok, that may have been going too far and considering my offer to not be weird, I suppose I should again forget about the secrets locked in special rooms in my mind. My name is unimportant at this juncture so for now you can call me Kookymom. Or just Kooky for short. Whatever floats your boat. I'm 24 (closer to 25 than 24 though), married and have the most beautiful boy and girl in the universe calling me mom. I know what you're thinking (mind reading isn't, however, one of my super powers, which I will tell you about in a few minutes), "They can't be the most beautiful because my kids are." Let me assure you, they are much more beautiful than your kids, or any other kids for that matter.       Now about my super powers. I have many unique talents I like to call my super powers. They include my neuroses (yes, that's plural). Many of the things I do must be done almost ritualistically. There is an order in which events are supposed to occur. I always think people don't like me, though maybe it's that they really don't like me, not just my thinking it. Social gatherings are hard for me. I can write but I can't talk to people very well. I tend to come off as snobby without intending to. I certainly wouldn't call myself stuck up, my social ineptitudes cause the vibes I give off to be interpreted as stuck up.      Some other faults of mine are my inability to be on time for anything, and my extreme moodiness. It's not that I'm always in a bad mood but often my mood will change suddenly, like a tornado dropping down out of the sky. Sometimes my mood swings are as destructive too. Not everything about me is bad though. I love my children fiercely and loyally protect anyone worthy of my protection. I have lots of interests and love doing many constructive things. Construction is always better than destruction.
