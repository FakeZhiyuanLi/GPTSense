      The night before Peekskill 16-and-under coach Windy Smythe got the opportunity to coach at the new Peekskill Stadium.  One night later, Friday, July 30, it was Andy Barresi, along with Billy Moran, who got the chance to coach at the jewel of Section 1 baseball fields and he was beaming.  “It’s great to be here,” said Barresi, after Peekskill’s 18-and-under WPBA squad defeated Kensico 4-3. “It’s just amazing how beautiful this field is and how the kids enjoyed it.   “This is the most beautiful park I’ve seen in a long time. Just look at it. I couldn’t ask for anything more. I’m glad the city finally got it done.”  The most important thing was that the kids played as a team and they played their hearts out, according to Barresi.   “There was no yelling or screaming,” Barresi said. “The kids just played the game. That’s the way the game should be played, the way they played it tonight.”  The field isn’t just a breakthrough for Peekskill baseball, it’s also a good thing for the County, according to Barresi.  “It brings in here all the other towns and cities,” Barresi said.  “They can play their games here for a nominal fee, I don’t know what it is. It’s great for the County of Westchester that you have a beautiful field like this. Hopefully other Counties and cities do the same thing as Peekskill did here.   “Just build a good facility so the kids can play and have somewhere to go.” A facility that the kids on the Peekskill squad are very appreciative to have, according to Barresi.  “The kids are ecstatic,” Barresi said. “Some feel they’ve been left out of other teams. In addition to kids from Peekskill, we also have kids from Ossining, Croton, Hen Hud and JFK. These kids love playing baseball here.”   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The lights went on for the first time at the new Peekskill Stadium in the latter stages of Peekskill’s 18-and-under division contest against Kensico.  Peekskill pitcher Chris McClellan however was on right from the beginning of the Friday, July 30 Westchester Putnam Baseball Association contest.  McClellan pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just two earned runs and three walks while striking out four in Peekskill’s 4-3 win.  McClellan became the first Peekskill pitcher to win a game at Peekskill Stadium.  “Hopefully this can be a building block for the Peekskill baseball program,’ McClellan said.  McClellan was backed up by a superb relief performance by John Wenk. With Peekskill holding on to a 4-3 lead in the seventh, Wenk made a diving catch to get the first out, induced a foul out to first before recording a strikeout for the final out of the game.  Kensico jumped off to 1-0 lead in the first inning but Peekskill (4-11) came back with three runs in the third. Scoring for Peekskill was Mike Tepper, McClellan and Billy Gallagher, who scored on a Ralph Sedlmayer single.  Peekskill scored its other run in the sixth when Wenk started the inning with a single and stole second, moved to third on a fielder’s choice before coming home on a wild pitch that put Peekskill in front 4-1  Kensico scored two runs in the seventh before being stymied by Wenk.  McClellan is hoping a win like this can give Peekskill momentum for the rest of the summer and into next spring during the varsity season.  “We have the talent on varsity,” McClellan said. “We want to go to the states.”  That would be a lofty goal for the Peekskill varsity squad considering it finished 6-12-1 this spring. However splitting the final two games against Section 1 Class A finalist Lakeland gives the Red Devils hope for the future.  “If we bring it every game we can be tough to beat,” McClellan said.  Playing this summer for the Peekskill WPBA team is a big help for McClellan.  “It’s important because you don’t want to go to the varsity rusty,” McClellan said. “I didn’t play in the summer last year and I was rusty this spring.”  As for the win against Kensico, McClellan did his job by keeping the batters off balance.  “I didn’t have my velocity but I had my location,” McClellan said. “My ball had a lot of movement on it.”  In addition to ball movement, staying within himself was a key according to Peekskill coach Andy Barresi.  “He just focused,” Barresi said. “He did what he was asked to do.”   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      For Peekskill 16-and-under coach Windy Smythe, being able to coach the first game at the new Peekskill Stadium is something that goes beyond words.  “It’s one of the highlights of my entire life,” said Smythe, after his Westchester Putnam Baseball Association squad lost to Beekman 13-3 on Thursday, July 29. “I’ve been in Peekskill for 50 years and we finally got a quality, first-rate Stadium.”  Depew Park is where the Peekskill baseball program previously hosted all of its home games beyond Little League, which plays at Tompkins Park.   While Depew Park is great for many things, the baseball program desperately needed an upgrade to its facilities if it wanted to have any hope of competing with the elite programs in Section 1.  Smythe feels that the new Stadium will help Peekskill keep kids playing baseball beyond their formative years.   “I think that at some point knowing that they will get a chance to play on this field, will give them more incentive to play,” Smythe said. “This is a first-rate facility. Kids that played Little League in Peekskill for a long time didn’t have anywhere to go.  “You look now there were a lot of little leaguers here tonight, that were saying that one day they could play here. They weren’t inspired by Depew Park.”  While the season hasn’t been a winning one for Smythe’s squad, it has garnered some much-needed experience, which should pay dividends in the future.   “We’re inexperienced but the guys are a bunch of good guys who work hard,” Smythe said. “We need some work, we need some time. To build a program takes a little effort and a little time.   “I’m saying in a year or two watch the difference in the program. The fact that we have a Little League team, a 14-year-old team, and 16-year-old team, the whole program is going to start to turn the corner in Peekskill.”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Peekskill’s Dan Camilo opened up the bottom of the first inning against Beekman with a single in the Westchester Putnam Baseball Association 16-and-under contest.  Normally that wouldn’t noteworthy but in this case it was. That’s because it was the first hit at the brand new Peekskill Stadium on Thursday, July 29.   “It felt really good,” said Camilo, 15. “I think it was the first pitch, a fast ball right down the middle. I hit a blooper into right field.”  Camilo’s single started off an inning that saw Peekskill (3-8) score the first two runs of the game in a 13-3 Beekman victory.   Despite the loss, just being able to take part in the first game in Peekskill Stadium, where Mayor John Testa threw out the first ball, was a great experience.  “It means a lot to me,” said Camilo, who was 3 for 3 with two runs scored. “This is an historic night for Peekskill and all the teams in Westchester County.”  The importance of playing in the summer for Camilo and his teammates goes beyond baseball.  “Not just skill and baseball wise but socially as well because you make a lot of friendships,” said Camilo, who has played baseball since he was 6 playing t-ball. “I will make a lot of lifetime friends playing baseball.”  Camilo played on the Peekskill JV baseball squad this spring and will be a junior this fall. He feels that the new field is a sign of things to come for the Peekskill baseball program.  “It’s (having the new field) is really important to play for the future of the program,” Camilo said.   After getting a single to lead off the bottom of the first, Camilo stole second and third before being driving in by base hit from Tyler Blott. Blott himself stole second and was driven in by Jonathan Smythe, who singled.  Beekman though took control of the game with two runs in the second and three in the third. Beekman’s Anthony Sciacca hit the first home run in Peekskill Stadium in the sixth.  Peekskill scored its other run in the third when Camilo singled, stole second and third before being driven in by a Chris Tarchine single.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      It was a glorious day, Wednesday, July 21 at the dedication ceremony for Peekskill Stadium.   The Stadium was something that people in Peekskill have been waiting a long time for.   A lot of people put in a ton of effort to make the Stadium a reality.   However, there is one person that without his efforts the Stadium would not have been built and that’s Don Foster. Foster has been the main force behind the Stadium and simply would not stop until the kids of Peekskill got their regulation-sized baseball field.   During the ceremony, Dave Woodward, a retired physical education teacher in the Peekskill school district, commented how important Foster’s efforts were to having a field.   He talked about the fact that the city of Peekskill waited 50 years for this place because so many people had the attitude “I’m only one person, what can I do?”   Woodward then pointed out that Foster was that one person that decided to do something, spearheading an effort that took 10 years to come to fruition.   Woodward’s words stuck with me because I fell into that trap of “I’m only one person, what can I do?”   I’m referring to the fact that there is no longer a weekly paper that focus’ in on just the Peekskill area only. When I found out that the Star was going from a weekly to a monthly in April, I thought maybe I should try to put something on the Internet.   I had thought about doing a blog on Peekskill sports the last few months but I thought, could that really do anything, would it really matter, I mean what could just one person do?   After listening to Woodward’s speech, I decided that maybe one person can make a difference.   So I decided to start a blog focusing on Peekskill sports.   Can a blog make up for a newspaper? Of course not.   However, with the help of everyone, this blog can make a difference.   So please call me at 582-8703 or e-mail me at msabini@mail.com with any items pertaining to Peekskill athletics and let’s see if we can make a difference.   I will be at the first game at Peekskill Stadium, Thursday, July 29 at 6 p.m. when the Peekskill 16-and-under squad, coached by Windy Smythe, competes in a Westchester Putnam Baseball Association contest.    I look forward to seeing everyone there.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      For the fourth-straight year, Peekskill graduate and Los Clippers forward Elton Brand will have a basketball clinic for the kids of Peekskill.  The clinic will take place today, Saturday, Aug. 7 at the Lindy Building on John Walsh Blvd. at 11 a.m. with a press conference taking place beforehand (for more info, see “Brand clinic to take place” in archives, Aug. 3).   It’s great to see Brand take the time to come and help the youth of Peekskill once again. So many times we hear the stories of big-time athletes who get the money and never go back to their hometown.  Brand though is the opposite. He sincerely enjoys coming back to his hometown and seeing the joy of the faces on the kids that have come to see him at the clinic.  One just has to look in Brand’s eyes and see them light up, whether he’s talking to the kids or showing them how to shoot.   Not only is it a chance to see Brand but over the years past Peekskill players have comeback to help run the clinic. Last year’s clinic included Hilton Armstrong and Rashard Turner.  Armstrong and Turner were on Peekskill’s squad that went to the state championship game in 2002. That was only the third team in Peekskill history to advance to a state final.  Armstrong also played this winter for the 2004 National Champion UConn squad.  The other two Peekskill teams that played for the state title were the 1994-95 and ‘95-96 squads that, led by Brand, won state championships.   So those kids who get to come out and see Brand may not only see one former Red Devil superstar but plenty more.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      It was quite a night for Mike Tepper, who plays for Peekskill’s Westchester Putnam Baseball Association 18-and-under squad.  Tepper, Peekskill’s leadoff batter, went 3 for 3 including a walk in Peekskill’s 5-4 loss against visiting Bedford Hills.  Peekskill plays at Somers today, Saturday Aug. 7 (12 p.m. or 5 p.m.). Peekskill will finish its season when it hosts Yorktown in a double-header at Peekskill Stadium the following day, Aug. 8 at 5 p.m.  The double-dip will be the season finale for Peekskill.   “We just want to go out with a bang,” Tepper said. “We want to get some wins and show teams that we’re not out of it completely.”  The senior to be from Hendrick Hudson started off Peekskill’s three-run first against Bedford Hills with a walk.  “When I lead off, I just want to get on base,” Tepper said. “I want everyone behind me to do everything else. Chris (Edwards) and Joe (Weldon) usually knock me in.”  That’s exactly what happened. Chris Edwards singled and Andrew Barresi got on by an error to load the bases before Chris McClellan’s three-run triple put Peekskill in front 3-0.  After Bedford Hills scored in the third, Tepper was in the position of being the one to have to drive in the run in the fourth. He did so with a single that brought in Brian Malaspina, who doubled.   Alex Candy inched Bedford Hills to 4-2 with a homer to left field in the fifth before a three-run shot to right by Jerry Nardone put the visitors up to stay in the seventh.  Tepper then tried to get Peekskill back ahead with a one-out single in the home team’s last at bat.   Peekskill though couldn’t push home a run, which sealed its fate.  “I was up second that inning,” Tepper said. “I was hoping that Phil (Philson George) would drop a good bunt. He did but the pitcher made a nice play to get him out.      “I was hoping that with his speed he would get on second so with a base hit I could tie the game.”  While his single couldn’t tie the game up, he nevertheless has enjoyed his new role as leadoff man.  “This is actually the first time where I’ve batted lead off all the time, 100 percent,” Tepper said. “As a leadoff man, I felt my job was to just get on base.   “I usually bat towards the bottom,” Tepper said. “A couple of times I’ve batted in the two spot when I was on JV at Hen Hud.”  What’s also different for Tepper is playing with kids from Peekskill.  “I’m not used to playing with these guys since I play for Hen Hud during the school year,” Tepper said. “This was a change for me.  “But I’ve been doing good so I’m excited to be on this team.”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The Peekskill 18-and-under boys Westchester Putnam Baseball Association squad will be playing tonight (Friday, Aug. 6) as part of Peekskill Celebration Weekend at 6 p.m. at Peekskill Stadium.  In addition to that game, Peekskill will also being taken part in a doubleheader at the Stadium Sunday, Aug. 8 at 1 p.m. against Yorktown.  The games are part of a weekend-long celebration of baseball where there will be 12 games throughout the weekend, from youth baseball to the men’s Westchester Rockland Wood Bat League.  Calling Peekskill Stadium home from that league is the Peekskill Tides, sponsored by Sound Federal Savings Bank. Peekskill (18-15) will host the Pleasantville Red Sox (17-11) Sunday, Aug. 8 at 10 a.m. in its regular-season finale.  Pleasantville, which is in fourth place and Peekskill, which is in sixth place, both have already clinched postseason berths so this should be an interesting preview for the playoffs.   Peekskill enters the contest on a four-game winning streak. Peekskill started the streak with a win against the New York Orioles 8-4.   The Tides continued their success by winning 7-5 against the Danbury Barons. The game was the first for the Tides in Peekskill Stadium.  It was a significant win, not only because it was the Stadium opener for the Tides but also because the Barons are 26-7 and in second place in the 14-team WRWBL. It’s a win that shows everyone that the Tides can do some serious damage in the postseason.   Peekskill then swept a doubleheader from the Westchester Rockies 8-7 and 10-1 to set up the showdown with Pleasantville.   In other baseball news, there will be fall youth baseball in Peekskill but in exactly what format has yet to be determined. Peekskill is contemplating playing in the Westchester Baseball Association and having an 18-and-under team, according to recreation supervisor Ray Glashoff.  The WBA is a wood bat only league. That would make the experience a unique one should they decide to ultimately play in the WBA.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      If your 40 years and up and want to go back in memory lane, playing an old-timer’s stickball game is the ticket for you.

      One of the best programs in Peekskill over the years has been the Peekskill recreation and parks department swimming program and this year has proved to be no exception.  Peekskill (4-1), coached by 1989 Peekskill High School graduate Dana Dapson, tied for the Division III championship. Peekskill shared the championship with Lewisboro, with each team accumulating 210 points in the divisionals.   In dual meets, Peekskill defeated Mount Kisco Country Club (283-131), Torview (259-214), Bedford Hills (320-144) and Lewisboro (255-232).   Peekskill’s lone loss was against Pocantico Hills 251-225.   The program has always had a lot of kids participate in it and this year was no exception with 77 swimmers being involved.   There will be much more about the swimming team’s championship season on this site in the near future.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      For John Hallinan, running the Jan Peek 10K race and two-mile walk, sponsored by Entergy Nuclear Northeast, is something that he looks forward to each and every year.  “I’ve been in charge of this race for four or five years,” said Hallinan, of the 27th annual event, which is part of Peekskill Celebration Weekend. “It’s a fun event and it’s in my hometown, which makes it nice.”  This year’s race will be this Saturday, Aug. 7 at 8 a.m. with registration beginning at 7 a.m. It starts at the newly refurbished Kiley Center on Main Street and finishes at the Gazebo on North Division Street.   “It’s not so much competing but people just enjoying running in a race that is either in their hometown or close by,” Hallinan said.  The proceeds from the race will go to Peekskill Celebration and the annual Columbus Day youth races in Depew Park in Peekskill.    “It’s really important that we do something to help the youth of the community,” Hallinan said. “A lot of kids have run those races for a long time. They have their pictures taken at those races and still have them even when their adults.”   Winning last year’s Jan Peek 10K, which had 66 participants, was Peekskill’s Michael Cheary (39 minutes and 29 seconds). The top female finisher was also from Peekskill, Elsie Delorenzo (44:43).   There were other runners from Peekskill that excelled in last summer’s race as well. Chris Langworthy (57:10) was second in the men’s 15-18 age group while Michele Henderlong (65:21) was fourth in the women’s 30-39 category.   Ted Bitter (45:15) was second in the men’s 50-59 bracket.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      One of the great things about the new Peekskill Stadium is that kids can have a chance to be like those in the major leagues and have the opportunity to play at night in it.  Peekskill’s Sean Smythe got a chance to play under the lights but did it for Brewster in the visitor’s 6-3 victory in the Westchester Putnam Baseball Association 16-and-under contest  Smythe, 12, got the chance to play with the older kids because Brewster only had eight players to play. Peekskill could’ve won the game by forfeit, but Sean’s dad, Windy, who coaches Peekskill, didn’t think that would accomplish anything.  “I don’t ever want to take a forfeit,” said Windy Smythe, whose team will host Yorktown tonight, Aug. 4, at 6 p.m.. “These kids get more experience by playing then by winning a meaningless forfeit. To be able to play under the lights in this new Stadium is a great experience for them. Like I said before it’s an unbelievable facility.  “It’s great for all the kids. It’s great for our team and it’s great for the visiting team. They were talking about how great the Stadium was. It’s going to snowball, it’s going to help Peekskill a great deal.”  Where Sean Smythe falls into all of this is Brewster needed one more player to play or else there would be no choice but for Peekskill (4-14) to accept the forfeit win.  “He (his dad) asked me do I want to play for the other team and I said yes,” Sean Smythe said. “I was wondering what would happen when I got home if I won while playing for Brewster.”  It’s an opportunity that Sean Smythe had been asking his dad for all summer for.  “Originally they were going to have a 14-and-under team and he was going to play up but we didn’t have enough kids,” Windy Smythe said. “He’s been dying to play.  “He’s a good player. It was exciting. I knew he would be happy. I knew he would play hard and he did.”  Sean Smythe, who singled in his first at bat, was grateful for the opportunity.  “It was a good experience,” Sean Smythe said. “One of the differences playing older kids is the look of a curve-ball. It’s harder playing the older kids.”  Alberto Soto, Harvey Barnes and Dan Camilo led Peekskill with two hits apiece. Also recording a base hit each were Sean Dwyer, Tyler Blot and Dan Piliero.  Chris Tarchine, Soto and Camilo scored for Peekskill.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      After leaving his post as coach of the Peekskill boys basketball team in midseason for personal reasons this past winter, Lou Panzanaro is back as coach of the Red Devils.  “I just like high school basketball and missed it,” said Panzanaro, who applied for the job in April and was named coach at a school board meeting July 6. “There was just no closure with the way things went last year. Plus, I would like to help a lot of these kids in the recruiting process for college this year.”  Panzanaro got some well-deserved time off. Including all the sports he has coached, Panzanaro has been involved in high school athletics roughly 30 years.  He spent part of his time away from Peekskill traveling to Los Angeles Clippers games, watching his former player, Elton Brand. He would usually go to games with Brand’s mom Daisy but sometimes did get to travel with the team.  “The travel can be grueling, it’s not as glamorous as everyone thinks it is,” Panzanaro said. “I didn’t even travel the whole six months and I was getting tired.”  “The thing I enjoyed most was being able to follow Elton so closely, watching him play basketball at the highest level.”   Getting to see the National Basketball Association up close and personal was an eye-opening experience for Panzanaro.   “I got to see how hard these players really work,” Panzanaro said. “So many people just think that once you get to the NBA you got it made, that you don’t work hard anymore and that’s not true. The Clippers worked as hard as they did at the end of the year as they did at the beginning. I had a different vision of the NBA.   “I thought that it was just players concentrating on their offensive game but what I saw was totally different than that. The players in the NBA work very hard on playing defense. Coach (Mike) Dunleavy and his staff stress that.”   One didn’t have to look any further than the finals this past June to realize how important defense is.  “Look what happened in the finals,” Panzanaro said. “The Pistons showed how important defense is. The Lakers may have been the more talented team offensively but they couldn’t beat the defense of the Pistons.”   NBA players just don’t work hard on defense according to Panzanaro.  “They just work hard in general,” Panzanaro said. “When they travel to a city, they will go right to the gym and practice. That’s tough to do because you don’t have a lot of time to practice in the NBA with an 82-game schedule.”   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Los Angeles Clippers standout forward and 1997 Peekskill High School graduate Elton Brand will be in town Saturday, Aug. 7 for his basketball clinic.  The clinic will be held at the Lindy Building on John Walsh Blvd. Registration has already been conducted, however those who show up on Saturday will be able to participate and register on the spot, according to Peekskill boys basketball coach Lou Panzanaro.  “Nobody will be turned away,” said Panzanaro, who will be running the clinic with Brand.  The below is when the clinic, which is for both boys and girls, will be held for each age group:  11 a.m. to 12 p.m. 14-17 year-olds 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. 11-13 year-olds 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. 7-10 year-olds  Before the clinic at 10 a.m. there will be a press conference at the Lindy Building announcing a joint venture between Elton Brand and the LeapFrog Corporation.  This venture is to support academic intervention programs for the youth in the Peekskill school district. It’s intended to help kids with their math and reading skills, primarily at the elementary school level.  Brand and Leapfrog will each be putting in $50,000 apiece to support the project.  This came about when Brand’s agent, Dave Eyl from SFX was talking to representatives from LeapFrog, who agreed to match whatever Brand put up.  “Elton is always looking to help kids in Peekskill, that’s why he has the clinic every year,” Panzanaro said. “In the past he also had a concert but decided to do something else this year that would be more lasting for the kids.”  That’s not all Brand is doing for the youth of Peekskill. On Aug. 20 at 3 p.m. there will be a press conference to announce the non-profit company Camp Inc., which stands for Comprehensive Action Model for Peekskill. It was formed with the support of Brand.  There will be a ribbon cutting ceremony which the whole community is invited to.  Camp Inc. will be a Learning and Resource Center at 55 Bank Street, right next to the Peekskill Health Care Center in downtown Peekskill.  This was done according to Panzanaro to address the needs of youth ages 13-17 to support not only their academic pursuits but also other talents, whatever they maybe. The center will include the NBA’s Read to Achieve program in Elton Brand’s name.  There will also be a golf tournament, Monday, Sept. 13 at McCann Golf Club in Poughkeepsie. It will be a Memorial Tournament honoring Peekskill High and Walter Panas graduates Louis Panzanaro III (coach Panzanaro’s son) and Ray Freeland, who both were killed in a car accident in 1994.  Part of the proceeds from the tournament will go to to a scholarship award in each of their names to Peekskill and Panas respectively. The rest of the proceeds will go to the Learning and Resource Center.  Any questions on any of the above, please call Panzanaro at 845-496-7034.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      During the summer, Paul Piliero spends his time as one of the coaches on Peekskill's 16-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association squad.  When it comes to the school year however he coaches cross country in the fall and track in the winter and spring months at Peekskill High School.  For Piliero, the challenge to rebuild the cross country program starts later this month.     "We'll have some preseason workouts," Piliero said. "We should have between 10 and 12 boys on the team. I'm not sure yet about how many girls.  "It's going to be a young team so we're going to feel it out in the beginning and see who are top five are. We just trying to keep everyone together and build a program."  During track season, he had the privelage of coaching football star Jarom Freeman. Freeman was one of the best backs in Section 1 last season, leading Peekskill to the cusp of the playoffs.  Many probably don't realize what a great performer on the track he is as last spring he was all-county in the 400-meters.  "He (Jarom) has a great combination of strength and speed and determination," Piliero said. "He's the most determined kid I've had coaching this team."

      Peekskill trailed Armonk 3-0 in its 16-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association contest in the opening inning but rallied for four runs in the bottom of the first to take a 4-3 lead.    The tying and go ahead runs came off the bat of third baseman Alberto Soto, who singled in extra hitter Dan Piliero and shortstop Tyler Blot.  Also scoring in the inning for Peekskill was first baseman Sean Dwyer and catcher/second baseman Chris Tarchine.   "That was the kind of pitch I like," Soto said. "He threw it right down the middle. I was thinking I was going to get a hit the whole time."  Unfortunately for Peekskill, Armonk pitcher John Watters settled down the rest of the way in a 14-4 victory for the visitors at Peekskill Stadium.  "He (Watters) started throwing curveballs that kept us off balance," Soto said.  Soto and his teammates will be back at Peekskill Stadium Wednesday, Aug. 4 and maybe even a day earlier, Tuesday, Aug. 3.   Peekskill will look to get back on track then.  "We have to keep playing hard the whole game," Soto said. "We have a tendence not to play hard the whole game and we have to change that."  Peekskill's 18-and-under squad followed with the first game of a doubleheader against Lakeland, coming up short 7-1.  The home team ran into a hot hurler in Lakeland pitcher Jim Kelm, who threw a complete game two-hitter.   Philson George provided the highlight for Peekskill in the sixth inning after striking out but getting on base by a wild pitch. George then stole second and third base before scoring on a wild pitch.  George and his teammates next home game is Friday, Aug. 6 at 6 p.m.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Today is a dream day for baseball junkies in Peekskill as there will be four baseball games at the new Peekskill Stadium on Louisa Street.  Playing the opener at 10 a.m. is Peekskill’s 16-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association team. Peekskill’s 18-and-under team will follow with a twinbill, beginning at 1 p.m.   The nightcap will be a Westchester Rockland Wood Bat League contest at 6 p.m between the Peekskill Tides (12-12) and Danbury Barons (23-5).  The Tides, sponsored by Sound Federal Savings Bank, were founded in 1995 as the Westchester Wildcats. They are the only original member of the WRWBL still in existence.   Since that time the team has also been known as the Peekskill Pirates, Cortlandt Riveters and now the Tides.   The Tides are made up of players from Peekskill, Cortlandt, Buchanan, Montrose, Croton and other northern Westchester communities.   Led by rookie Manager Paul Marino, the Tides roster consist of players who have competed collegiately at schools such as Notre Dame, Lehigh, Marist College, Pace University, Wesleyan College, Muehlenberg College, the University of Hartford, Dominican College and Westchester Community College among others.

      Hilton Armstrong, 2002 Peekskill High School graduate, is participating in this year’s Empire State Games taking place in Binghamton University this weekend.  Armstrong, who is playing for the Hudson Valley men’s open basketball squad, scored 10 points in a 79-66 loss to Western and seven in a 102-74 setback to Long Island. Both games were played at Binghamton University’s East Gym.  Armstrong competed but didn’t score in Hudson Valley’s 101-95 loss to Adirondack, played at Binghamton University’s Events Center.   The standings now read as follows: Long Island (2-0), Adirondack (2-1), New York City (1-1), Central (1-1), Western (1-1) and Hudson Valley (0-3).   Armstrong of course spent last winter, his sophomore season, playing for the 2004 national champion Connecticut Huskies (33-6).   His personal highlight was grabbing a, team-high 12 rebounds in a 88-55 triumph against Quinnipiac.   In his senior year (2001-02) playing for Peekskill, Armstrong averaged 14.1 points, 12.8 rebounds, 4.6 blocked shots and 2.1 assists for a Red Devil squad that went to the New York State Class B championship game.  That Peekskill team was only the third in school history to make it to the state finals.  The other two, the 1994-95 and '95-96 squads, led by current Los Angeles Clipper standout Elton Brand, won state titles in Class C and B respectively.

      When Peekskill boys basketball coach Lou Panzanaro started the Red Devil Basketball Camp 20 years ago, they weren’t exactly lining up to get in.   Things though have changed for the better.  “It’s the fact that the sport itself has become so popular over the years,” said Panzanaro of the popularity of the camp. “Our first year we only had 15 campers and it took a good few years before we had any girls at all. Now we have 80.”   Including both boys and girls, there should be over 200 participants at the camp according to Panzanaro.   “We don’t really do much advertising at all,” Panzanaro said. “It’s just word of mouth through the kids.”  The kids are ages 7-16 coming from the greater Peekskill area.  The following schools the camp will be held at:   Woodside Elementary School (boys 9-10), Oakside Elementary School (boys 8), Frank G. Lindsey Elementary School (boys 7), Furnace Woods Elementary School (girls 7-10), Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School (girls 11-16) and Blue Mountain Middle School (boys 11-16).   The camp will start Monday, Aug. 16 and go through Friday, Aug. 20. Each day the camp will go from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.   In addition to Panzanaro, other coaches involved are Peekskill girls coach Greg Blake, John Jay girls coach Chuck Scozzafava, John Jay JV boys coach Art Blank and Peekskill boys assistant coaches Anthony Jackson and Rodney Headley Sr.   Former Peekskill High School players Bryan Panzanaro and Artie McGriff will also be doing instruction.   “We’ve been fortunate to have the good group of coaches that we’ve had over the years,” Lou Panzanaro said.  Helping out as counselors are current and past Red Devil players, including Hilton Armstrong, Rashard Turner and Rodney Headley Jr., who all played for the Peekskill squad that made the state finals in 2002.    “It’s great to see them work with the young kids,” Lou Panzanaro said. “They play at such a high level and yet are still able to get down to the kids level and teach them the fundamentals of the game. They are becoming good teachers.”   Players coming back are one reason why the camp has become so popular. There are others, according to Lou Panzanaro.  “The success of the high school team over the years and what Elton Brand has gone on to do (being an NBA all-star for the Los Angeles Clippers),” Lou Panzanaro said. “We’ve also been fortunate to have Elton stop by when he’s available.   “The kids receive good instruction and we put in fun type of games for the kids to play.”   A typical day starts with 40 minutes of fundamentals, followed by playing a game, then a instruction of a specific skill, shooting for example.   Campers will then play another game followed by a skills competition like a hotshot contest.   To those that think it sounds like fun and why wouldn’t it, it’s not too late to call and join the camp. For those interested, they can reach Lou Panzanaro at 914-906-6932.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Both New York football teams begin preseason action tonight (Friday, Aug. 13) with my Jets playing at the Saints while the Giants will host the Chiefs.  It’s not only the beginning for the NFL teams as the Peekskill football team will start practice Monday, Aug. 16 at Torpy Field.  Where our local teams will end up only time will tell but the preseason is the beginning of what everyone hopes is a great ride.  Some, especially when it comes to pro football, say the preseason is a waste of time and just want the real thing to get here as soon as possible.  For Peekskill, the real thing will begin Saturday, Sept. 4 at 1:30 p.m. when the Red Devils travel to Scarsdale.   As for preseason football most fans consider it not only boring but also harmful, as Jets and Falcons fans found out last season when they lost star quarterbacks Chad Pennington and Michael Vick to injuries. Those injuries ruined the season for both teams.  While it’s true that the preseason for fans can be a snooze-fest it is very important for teams on all levels, from high school to the pros, to take full advantage of that practice time. That’s because if you don’t someone else is.  To be honest, if a team’s only preseason practice is during the summer, they are behind the eight ball. Most players attend camps and workouts during the offseason so when practice officially starts, they already know the basics and can get into the heart of what they want to do.  In high school football, thankfully there are no preseason games, though most teams will have a controlled scrimmage, usually the Saturday before their first game. A lot of times these scrimmages consist of four teams at one site, giving the schools a chance to go up against as many different schemes as possible.  It’s common practice that teams will schedule scrimmages against teams that they are not scheduled to play in the regular season, for obvious reasons.  What will be interesting to see from Peekskill’s point of view is if they can keep up the momentum after just missing out on the playoffs last season.   One good indicator usually is how many people will show up for that first practice. Last season, Peekskill had 33 players, more than its had in recent memory.  If the Red Devils have that many players show up for the varsity Monday and can stay with the team throughout the season, Peekskill will already be ahead of the game.   Another thing to look for is if the Peekskill players are eager to accept the challenge of playing a tough-league schedule after playing a weighted schedule that was in their favor last season.  When first-year coach Devan Murray, who was an assistant on last year’s squad, was asked about playing a tougher schedule back in June, he indicated that wouldn’t be a problem. He said that his team would be up for the challenge.  Hopefully his players will feel the same way.  Judging by their play last season, it would seem that they will be ready to take on the challenge but only time will tell.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The brand new Peekskill Stadium on Louisa Street has received rave reviews and rightfully so.   People in the town of course are going to crow about having one of the crown-jewel fields, if not the crown jewel, in Westchester County and rightfully so. After years of fighting to get a field and to finally get it and be able to enjoy it, it’s no wonder why the people in Peekskill take so much pride in it.  It’s great to see the people in Peekskill take that pride in the Stadium. However, to really see whether or not a place passes the test is when someone from the outside comes and plays on it and enjoys it.  One of those people is Ryan Murphy, who plays third base for the Yorktown 18-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association squad.  In the first game of a doubleheader against Peekskill, Murphy went 2 for 4, including a three-run homer and five RBI, in the visitor’s 12-0 triumph on Aug. 8.  Putting up good stats and winning was just half the fun for Murphy, however.  In-between games of the doubleheader, Murphy stood behind home plate and was asked about his experience of playing at Peekskill Stadium for the first time.  “It’s amazing,” Murphy said.  “It’s just a great field.” “It’s like playing in a minor-league stadium. It’s a great atmosphere. It’s maintained and everything.”  Murphy’s reaction won’t be the first time a visiting player sings the praises of Peekskill Stadium, you can count on that.

      Last year, the Jan Peek 10K race and two-mile walk had 66 participants. This year, that number almost doubled to 116.  “In the past, we have had conflicts with the Taconic Road Runners Club and their race,” race director John Hallinan said. “This year there was no conflict plus the Club helped us to promote it.”  The race, which took place Aug. 7, was part of Peekskill Celebration Weekend.  “It was nice to see that many people show up,” Hallinan said. “It was very encouraging.”  Hallinan is hopeful that things can be just as good next year but certain things have to be done.  “We have to sit down with the celebration people and the Taconic Road Runners Club and see if we can avoid a conflict again,” Hallinan said.  The below are the top 50 finishers, including name, age time plus individual category, provided by Hallinan:  1. Bob Sweeney, 37, 34:20 (first overall male) 2.

      It’s our great pleasure to have Don Chiulli and his reports on the Peekskill Horseshoe League.   Chiulli has been doing these since the days of the Peekskill Herald. His love for horseshoes is so great that, Rob Caluori chronicled it in the July edition of the Star.  If anyone else would like to provide information on their league like Chiulli does, please contact me at 914-582-8703 or msabini@mail.com  Without further ado, Chiulli’s report:   On Monday, Aug. 2 the pits at Depew Park were clinking. It seems as though most players were having a fairly good ringer percentage and five of them made the high-game honors.  Wolf Lazevnick came in with 50 percent, Don Chiulli 46, Marty Silverstein 44 with Mike Weinborg and Ray Levesque both tossing 40.   Buchanan Home Center defeated DaRo’s 5-1 with DaRo’s lone point coming in the “A” game. John Pollack nipped Mike Ryan 34-31 but Buchanan Home Center got the rest. Ray Levesque won against Tom Irving 53-16 and Mike DeRonda slipped by Jim Sewalk 27-23.  Mike’s Masonry also had a pretty good night with a 4-2 win over Curry’s Funeral Home. Chiulli and Silverstein dueled it out to the last shoe and Chiulli held his nine-point spot in a 35-25 win.   Bob Stein and Ron Page also went down to the wire with Stein winning it on the last two shoes 29-25 for Curry’s Funeral Home.   Tom Sheppard beat Bob Pristash 45-23 to give Mike’s the win.  Baisley’s and Ekezian’s split 3-3 with carpetmen taking the “A” and “B” games. Weinborg nipped Joe White 43-41 after eliminating a 17-point spot and Dick Hastede topped Brian Wolert 33-24.  Al Felicione got one for Baisley’s with a 39-21 victory against Fred Vanca.  Park Motors and Saccente’s House of Printing also split 3-3 with Wolf Lazevnick beating brother Bob 47-27 to give Park Motors a point. Saccente’s took the “B” and “C” with Dave Wolert beating Al Schwarz 47-29 and Frank Saccente nipping Jim Batwinas 30-28.   After 10 weeks, the standings are: Mike’s Masonry (40-20), Buchanan Home Center (35-25), Curry’s Funeral Home (34-26), Ekezian’s Carpets (29-31), DaRo’s Deli (27-33), Saccente’s House of Printing (26-34), Park Motors (25-35) and Baisley’s Market (24-36).

      It looked like it was going to be a long night for Peekskill pitcher Chris Edwards after Yorktown’s John Murphy hit a two-run homer that gave the visitors a 3-0 lead in the top of the first.  “The home run was a mistake pitch,” Edwards said. “It was a 3-1 count. I needed something over the plate. I just left it too much over the plate and he hit it over the fence.”  Edwards though was a completely different pitcher after the opening stanza. Edwards struck out 11 and at one point, retired 11 in a row.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough for host Peekskill (5-21-1) in a 3-2 Yorktown (14-11) 18-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association victory.  “After that (the home run), I found my release point and felt good on the mound,” Edwards said. “Everything just kind of flowed after that.”  His catcher, Mike Anderson, explained how he was able to do so.  “He was just hitting that outside corner all night long,” Anderson said. “After the first, everything went smoothly.”  Peekskill got back in the game when it scored twice in the third inning. Ralph Sedlmayer and Andrew Barresi each had RBI singles, which drove in Chris McClellan and Mike Tepper.  “I felt really good about keeping my team in the game,” Edwards said. “After the first inning I was hitting every spot that he (Anderson) put down. My number one goal was to keep the team in the game.”  It was a game that saw Peekskill have numerous chances but fell short in the Aug. 8 contest. Yorktown pitcher Ricky Erickson struck out eight and did a good job of getting out of jams in Peekskill’s season finale, at least for the summer.  “Playing baseball this summer was a lot of fun,” Edwards said. “I’m going to end up playing in the fall in the wood bat league (for the Peekskill entry in the Westchester Baseball Association). I had fun with all these guys. I hope they are all on the team in the fall.”  Anderson concurred.  “I loved it,” Anderson said. “I had a good time and I can’t wait for us all to comeback in the fall.”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      It was August but the weather made it feel more like a perfect, cool, September night at Peekskill Stadium.  The Stadium was hosting the summer finale for Peekskill’s 18-and-under baseball team, which fell to Yorktown 3-2.  The night was made extra special when Mike Miner’s MJM Video and Television production staff shot the game for local cable.  When it comes to local television, Miner has been the man for many moons and last night’s game was no exception.  Calling the game for Miner’s crew was Joe DeChristopher. DeChristopher has been calling various Peekskill sporting events for years.  It was fitting that DeChristopher was the first television announcer to call a game inside the new Peekskill Stadium press box. In addition to being a first-rate announcer, DeChristopher has been heavily involved in Peekskill baseball over the years from coaching to anything else you can think of.  During the beginning of the game, he had on Peekskill Mayor John Testa. The two talked about everything from all the benefits of the new field on Louisa Street to the success that Peekskill Celebration Weekend was.  Later in the game, DeChristopher chatted with Peekskill recreation supervisor Ray Glashoff, who was quite entertaining in his own, unique way.  The end of the game saw DeChristopher interview Peekskill pitcher Chris Edwards and catcher Mike Anderson. Each of them enjoyed looking into the camera and talking about their baseball exploits.  DeChristopher near the end of his broadcast said that he hoped that it would be the first many games MJM would televise at the new field.  We hope so to because it adds a lot to the game when it’s televised.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The game of basketball, like all other sports, has become so commercialized today sometimes we forget what the basics of it are all about.  It’s about dribbling and shooting, like Tyler Bynoe, 9, did at the Elton Brand clinic right next to the Lindy Building on John Walsh Blvd. in Peekskill.  Bynoe dribbled, shot and hit nothing but net, just like one of his idols does on a nightly basis for the Los Angeles Clippers.  “Elton is one of my favorite players,” said Bynoe on Aug. 7. “I like how he shoots and the way he dribbles.”  Brand has held this clinic for four years now and it means a lot to a kid like Bynoe to take the time to do so.  “I really don’t know how to put it but it’s special that he comes back for us,” Bynoe said.  Those that have known Brand since their childhood days know that it’s no surprise at all that Brand keeps coming back to his community unlike some other big-time athletes who don’t.  “He’s different because he’s down to earth,” said Brian "Buck" Cureton, who has known him since his youth. “He never forgot his roots. When he was in Peekskill a lot of people helped him get to where he is today and he didn’t forget that. Now he’s returning the favor.”  Not only is Brand interested in helping make the kids better basketball players, more importantly he wants them to do well in the classroom.  That’s why Brand, the Elton Brand Foundation and the LeapFrog School House announced before the clinic that they are donating $100,000 worth of LeapTrack Assessment and Instruction Systems to the Peekskill School District for elementary school kids.  “We saw their great interactive system,” Brand said. “We thought maybe they would get involved with us. We made a donation ($50,000) and they matched it.  “This makes it possible for kids in kindergarten through fourth grade to get the interactive system. It’s a great thing. It helps children with their reading and their learning overall.”  Brand is involved in this because he has a sincere interest in seeing the youth of Peekskill reaching their full potential in the classroom.  “I want the kids to have a future when they're out of school,” Brand said. “Learning is the way to get to college.  “I do this because I love the community here. They did so much for me.”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      When NBA star Elton Brand holds his basketball clinic in Peekskill, many current and former Peekskill Red Devils comeback and help him run it.  One of them was Hilton Armstrong, who was a member of this year’s national championship UConn unit.  “I can’t explain it,” said Armstrong, who is entering his junior year at the school in the nutmeg state. “It’s not something that you can put into words. It was just a dream come true to win a national championship.”  Armstrong of course was a mainstay on Peekskill’s 2002 team that went to the state finals, only the third Red Devil squad to do so.  He just wishes that they could’ve won one more game.  “I wish we could’ve won a state title when I was here,” Armstrong said. “That would’ve made things even better.”  The fact that it still bothers Armstrong that he didn’t win a state title shows how much he still loves his alma mater.  “In my heart, Peekskill is always going to be my home, no matter where I am,” Armstrong said. “I like coming back here and helping anyway I can.”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The Los Angeles Clippers recently acquired guard Kerry Kittles from the New Jersey Nets for a second round draft pick and cash considerations.  “We’re excited to have him,” said Elton Brand before his annual basketball clinic for the youth of Peekskill on Aug. 7. “Kerry Kittles is a big shooter and a veteran player who's been to the finals twice. He knows how to win and how to play the right way. It’s what we need on this team.”  In addition to Kittles, the Clippers should benefit from the experience of playing under coach Mike Dunleavy this past winter and having him back again this season.  Dunleavy’s coaching history includes six playoff appearances, a trip to the NBA finals and a NBA coach of the year award.  “He’s prepared for each and every game,” Brand said. “He’s a winning coach. I’m excited that we have a coach that can get us to the level where we can win.”  “We want to get to the playoffs and get as far as we can. Our ultimate goal is to do what Detroit did this year (which was win an NBA title).”  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      We have changed the name from Peekskill to Peekskill/Cortlandt to reflect the fact that in addition to covering Peekskill High School, we will also be doing Hendrick Hudson, Walter Panas and Lakeland as well.  For those from Cortlandt, give us a little bit of time and we’ll have plenty of stuff for you. Today we’ll have a story on the four-time sectional volleyball champions from Hendrick Hudson.  Also, in the archives on Aug. 7 we did a story on Hen Hud baseball player Mike Tepper and his role as leadoff man on the Peekskill 18-and-under Westchester Putnam Baseball Association squad.  As for those in Peekskill, specifically my man Don Foster, the commitment to covering the Red Devils hasn’t changed, we’re just having more people at the party if you will, that’s all.  Matter of fact, I will be at the basketball championships for the Peekskill rec league tomorrow (Friday, Aug. 20) at 5 p.m. at Lepore Park (Oakside if it rains).  And rest assured, we won’t be expanding anytime soon. For one reason I’m just one person and four schools is about all I could handle.  More importantly the point of doing this to begin with was to do something that’s local with the unfortunate demise of the Star weekly in April and Peekskill/Cortlandt is as local as it gets.  Cortlandt I always wanted to add down the road and as you can see, down the road came about much more quickly than anticipated.  In addition to the school coverage, we will do recreation stuff time permitting. Obviously during the summer, we’ll have a lot more rec coverage than during the school year.  However, we’ll do our best to do rec things during the school year when possible.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      To win one sectional championship is quite an achievement.     However, to win four championships in a row is something that takes a year in and year out commitment and that’s what exists in the Hendrick Hudson volleyball program.  “It’s a combination of consistent coaching, I give 100 percent and the devotion of the kids,” Hen Hud coach Diane Swertfager said. “The kids work hard not only during the season but also during the offseason.  “The parents are also very important. They make sure that the kids get the proper sleep and are scholar athletes, because girls on the non-eligible list are not allowed to participate.”  This season the Sailors will start their quest for a fifth straight sectional championship Tuesday, Sept. 7 at 4:30 p.m. against Tappan Zee.  Hen Hud’s next two matches will be at home at 4:30 p.m. against Sleepy Hollow (Sept. 9) and Walter Panas (Sept. 10).      Leading the Sailors is senior setter Maggie Wright, who was all-section a year ago.      “She’s the best setter we’ve ever had at Hen Hud,” Swertfager said. “Now that I’ve said that, it will put a lot of pressure on her but she can handle it. She has big shoulders.”  Senior Lauren Martino, junior Alysha Fanning and sophomore Lindsy Hock are other players that Swertfager will be looking to this season.  Swertfager also stressed the importance of the rest of team, from the top of the roster to the bottom.  That’s because without contributions from everyone, there would be no volleyball dynasty in Montrose.   Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      For those looking for a great day of basketball, look no further than the championships in the Peekskill Recreation Basketball League.  The championships will be held at Lepore Park Friday, Aug. 20 at 5 p.m. In case of rain, they will be moved to Oakside Elementary School.  Four divisions will be hosting championships and they are 10-and-under, 12-and-under, 14-and-under and 16-and-under. The games are scheduled to be in that order.  P.J. Tinsley has run the league for the longest time and the success of the Peekskill Red Devils is proof of what he does is something special.   Those like Peekskill boys basketball coach Lou Panzanaro and Rashard Turner, who was a star guard on the 2002 Peekskill Red Devil squad that went the state finals, have credited Tinsley with being an vital part of the Peekskill dynasty.   Tinsley is a vital part of it because without him running a league to help develop younger players, there are no trips to the Westchester County Center in February/March.   So those of you who want to catch a glimpse of the Red Devil future, the championships at Lepore Park are the place to be.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      It was three hours before his first practice as coach of the Peekskill football team but Devan Murray was already to go.      “I’ve been waiting for this day since the end of last year,” said Murray on Aug. 16. “I coach different sports (he is also the varsity softball coach at Peekskill) but football is the reason why I got into coaching.”   Murray, who was an assistant on last year’s team, was named head coach in June. During the offseason, he was in charge of the Red Devils weightlifting program.  According to the first-year coach, 20 players participated in the program, one night a week, which started in January. Murray expected players who weren’t at the time playing in a sport to participate.   Even some players that were already playing a sport would come after practice to get their weightlifting in.  “I couldn’t make it mandatory but I told the kids that you’d be able to tell the difference in working out in the offseason and not working out,” Murray said.  “You just can’t show up in August and expect results.”   Murray expects between 25-30 players on the varsity this fall. He also is hopeful Peekskill will field both a JV and modified team this year.   Last year, there was a modified team but no JV.   “It’s very important to have those teams,” Murray said. “Those kids are the future of the program. It was very tough last year not having a JV and essentially having to start from scratch.   “Having the feeder programs is vital because when they get to the varsity you just want to get right into everything without having to go over the basics.”   A typical pre-season practice will have players arriving between 3 p.m.-3:30 p.m. Practice will start at 4 p.m. at Torpy Field and go to 8 p.m.   “Basically we’re looking to get the fundamentals down and looking to install the new offense,” Murray said. “Last year we were a power-I team because we had a big line.   “However, we won’t have that this season so we’d like to spread the ball around the field some more this year.”   Murray will get a better idea of where his team is headed Aug. 28 at 10 a.m. when the Red Devils take part in a four-way scrimmage at Rye Neck with Rye Neck, Haldane and Yonkers.   “The kids enjoy it,” Murray said. “They look forward to going against someone else in a different uniform after going against their teammates in practice.   “It’s important for the coaches and players to see different teams and how you’re going to react to them. I wish we could scrimmage eight teams.”     Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      The Peekskill Red Devils football squad is slated to start practice today, probably inside according to coach Devan Murray because of the inclement weather.  All other teams are allowed to begin practice Wednesday, Aug. 18 except for one problem. Some of them still need a coach.  Volleyball has a coach with John Pappas in charge and cross country with Paul Piliero running the show.  However, girls swimming, boys soccer and girls tennis don't have coaches as of this writing.  "We're working on trying to fill those positions as we speak," said Peekskill Athletic Director Jim Rose. "A lot of schools are having trouble filling coaching positions."  There are a couple of reasons for this, according to Rose.  "It's a lot of time for a person to give up, more than it's ever been," Rose said. "There are more requirements of coaches than there have been in the past.  "On top of that, you have the same school districts that are looking to fill these positions competing with one another for coaches."  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Today is the day that all Section 1 football teams are allowed to step on the field and start practice.  Many teams, at least the ones who are looking to do well, have done workouts, camps and the like during the offseason but now it’s the time that everyone will have their eyes on the football team.  Peekskill will hope that this is the continuation of what started last year when it went 4-5 after winning just two games the previous two seasons, with one of those wins coming by forfeit.  The Red Devils will have three weeks to prepare for their Sept. 4 opener, which is 1:30 p.m. at Scarsdale. Last year the two squads played a game that was truly one of the most entertaining games ever played at Depew Park.  Trailing 34-0, Peekskill made a wild comeback attempt, tying the score at 34 before losing 41-34.  Following that contest will be Peekskill’s home opener Sept. 11 at 1:30 p.m. against Hendrick Hudson. Last year Peekskill defeated the Sailors 15-2 at Hen Hud’s homecoming.  The win for Peekskill snapped a five-game winning streak in the series for the Sailors and got the Red Devils headed in the right direction last fall.  Peekskill then travels to Port Chester Sept. 18 at 1:30 p.m. looking to avenge a 32-13 road loss to the Rams a year ago in its season finale.  The Red Devils will also be looking for payback when they host Lakeland Sept. 23 at 4:15 p.m. in their homecoming game. Last year the two teams played with the playoffs on the line in Lakeland's homecoming game, with the Hornets winning 24-21 on a field goal with less than a minute left.  Peekskill will host a Harrison squad, which is traditionally one of the best schools in the state Oct. 2 at 1:30 p.m.  The Red Devils will then have the challenge of challenges when they cross the Tappan Zee Bridge Oct. 8 at 7:30 p.m. to play defending New York State Class A champion Nyack.  Last year, the Red Devils avoided Nyack because of the weighted schedule but since they are going back to league play, there is no avoiding the giant from Rockland County this time around.  Peekskill will finish the regular season Oct. 16 at 1:30 p.m. when it hosts Spring Valley. This is another revenge game for Peekskill as it looks to atone for an 18-0 loss on the road a season ago.  In that contest, Peekskill’s defense looked great but turnovers in their own territory led to the loss.  After that, Peekskill will either play playoff games or two more regular season games if it misses the postseason.  Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com

      Those of us who write like to make everyone think that we come up with some great ideas with lots of hard work.  Sometimes that's the truth but other times it's just dumb luck to be honest.  For example, I was calling Peekskill boys basketball Lou Panzanaro the other day about the opening of the Camp Inc. Learning and Resource Center. It was a good thing I called, because the press conference for the grand opening was changed.  There was another reason I was glad that I called. It's was because he told me about the Red Devil basketball camp which has been going on for 20 years now.  That was a good thing because I was wondering what I was going to write and right out of the blue, I had a great story about this camp which has been helpful to so many people.  Of course, while it's up to us writers to come up with the story ideas we always encourage people to get in contact with us. So if you have a story idea, please let me know and I will try to persue to the best of my ability.  Especially at this time of year, it helps a writer covering high school/local sports to get help wherever they can. Football teams start practicing Monday, Aug. 16 with everyone else going two days later so the ideas will be coming fast and furious to me before I know it.  Still, it can't ever hurt to get some help along the way so if you have an idea, call or e-mail me. I look forward to seeing everyone around this school year.
