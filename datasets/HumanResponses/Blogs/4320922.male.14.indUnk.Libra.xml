      Well the first thing would have to be check out this blog I just stumbled onto  urlLink http://toomadawg.blogspot.com/  Its really a cool one I enjoyed reading most of it.  Oh yea and the other thing was why I'm pissed today. As some of my friends may know my website was shutdown and deleted today for 'Supposedly putting illegal files on my site' Or some crap like that. It pisses me off so much. I had nothing wrong or illegal on my site, I was stealing bandwith from noone and had permission to use all of the files on it. So I guess this is also a warning Blog, the warning being   IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A WEBSITE DO NOT USE TRIPOD OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATE SITES THEY WILL SCREW YOU!         Ok that being said I think I can finally move on without these outbursts anymore SCREW TRIPOD! *Ahem* Sorry about that. Anyway as I was saying TRIPOD'S GAY! I am completely fine. I need to go cry now...

      WHOA! I can't believe its finally happening, THE NEW EPISODES OF FAMILY GUY ARE COMING! Man I must have no life, but I love that show, I watch it all the time. I bought the DVD's too.  Here's A picture Of one of the DVD covers. If you haven't seen this show before you gotta watch it! It's really a funny show. Plus it has a talking dog!  Anyone reading this listen to Howard Stern? I do! He's wicked funny, I guess i must be entertained really easily but somehow everything is funny. I dont get why. Am i dumb for being able to find something funny about almost anything? They do say ignorance is bliss, and maybe im so ignorant it just doesnt matter. Hell, no-one may ever read what i'm writing right now but thats ok, I just like to write not only because its something to do, but its also fun. Reading and writing are fun things to do. Alot of people think its stupid to like to read but i dont. I actually go around reading other people's Blogs all the time. If you read around you can find some pretty cool one's out there. Some are happy, funny one's others are more sad, no matter what your preferance there's always a book, blog, or magazine you can pick up and read. So why don't you? Do you not like to read? I bet you if your reading this right now, you probably like reading (Or your one of my friends I forced Into reading this) either way you probably like to read. Have you read the Harry Potter books? Alot of people have. Everyone's read a book before that they liked even a little I bet. Even people I know who only read sports books must  like them. Sometimes I think people pretend they dont like to read because its to nerdy, or its embarasing in front of people. So what? Your reading, if worst come to worst lie about why you are, Examples could include such things as "I Have a book report due in like to days I haven't even Started" Or If the people are in your class: "The teacher gave me extra work cuz I failed a test." Or you could just say you're bored. See how hard was that? Not very right? So even if you like to read but people think its stupid there's always a way to do it. You could even send all of your time waiting here for me to post another blog, hint hint.
