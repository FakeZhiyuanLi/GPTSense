         So I was watching "The Transporter" today..and the main actRESS, is Shu Qi, a Taiwanese girl. Sometimes she's a TERRIBLE actress, and she can't speak english very well, (obviously, with her accent and everything), yet she stars in many english movies. and chinese movies..but her main language is taiwanese.duH..so when she speaks cantonese..it sounds funnie. I believe that the only reason why she IS in the movie business is because of her looks...   urlLink       ...why is she so PRETTY? I wish I could be as pretty as her=(

       Some people live for the fortune  Some people live just for the fame  Some people live for the power, yeah  Some people live just to play the game  Some people think that the physical things define what’s within  And I been there before but that’s life’s a bore, so full of the superficial   Chorus:  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah   Some people search for a fountain  The promise is forever young  (You know) Some people need 3 dozen roses  And that’s the only way to prove you love them  Hand me the world on a silver platter  And what good would it be?  With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me   Chorus:  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, you, you  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah   If aint got you with me baby, ohh, ooo  Say nothing in this whole wide world don’t mean a thing  If I aint got you with me baby.

I'M CONFUSED!!"    "we have our ways" *wink*-jO     &nbsp;   Second stop: McLean's    hehe, returning 2 novels that his sister was reading...something about..arctic.? ummm, everest i think...arctic/everest..they both have snow.     &nbsp;   Third stop: dominion    "chris..we're grocery shopping together..this is too wierd.."-jO   awwwwwwwwwwwww, they made a grocery list for you chris!! hahahaha....let's see...what do we have to get..?       tuna fish    bananas    mustard    marshmellows    ricecakes     "how many bananas do you need?"-jO  "about 12 maybe"-chris  "NO!! don't pick the completely ripe ones!! they'll go bad faster!!"-jO  "then YOU pick them!!"-chris  "ok, how many do we have now?"-jO"  "uhhhhhhh, 11, so one more"-chris  "WHAT?! DON'T JUST BUY ONE BANANA!! THAT'S STUPID!!you don't have to get exactly 12 chris!!"jO   Forth stop: Home Depot  .   "first grocery shopping then shopping at home depot...chris..what are we doinG?!"-jO so we found everything we needed at home depot...just one last thing..we need cable wire..well we found the cable wire..and you know how whenever you're at home depot, and when you need something, there's like, NO ONE THERE? but when you don't need anything, THEY WON'T STOP BUGGING YOU?? YEAH!! that happened. we needed to get cable wire cut..but there was no cutters. so we needed to find someone to cut the wire for us.  "where the hell is everybody when you need 'em?"-jO  so we ran around the store lookin for someone to cut the wire...we found this guy..  "excuse me, i need to get some cable wire cut."-chris  "table wire cut?"-crazy old man  "no... cable  wire"-chris  "table wire?!"-crazy old man  "no!! CABLE WIRE!!"-chris  hahahahhahahahahha.........what a crazy old man. then he said he was going to go page someone for us..cuz he ca'nt help us..cuz that's not his work area...*coughcoughbullshitcoughcough* well if certain ppl have their work areas, then where the hell is everyone in the work area where we need someone?! so we wait...for another 10min. no one came..  "look there's another dude, ask him!"-jO  "excuse me, we need some cable wire cut."-chris  "uh, yeah wait there, and i'll get someone to come"-some dude called marcus  no one came.  "forget it let's just leave"-chris  "oh no, they're gunna get a piece of me..i wanna yell at them!! go up to customer service and tell them that you've been waiting for 30 MIN TRYING TO GET SOME DAMN CABLE WIRE CUT, AND AFTER 2 PPL SAID THEY'D PAGE SOMEONE TO COME, NO ONE CAME!!"-jO  and of course chris, being quite passive..says..."i'll come tomorrow"  well if it was up to me,, i'd yell lol. but it wasn't. we wasted 30min in homedepot, for NOTHING     Fifth Stop: walmart  we need     apple sauce     we went all the way to walmart..........to get apple sauce. why? cuz his parents phoned him and added it to the list of things he need to get. by the time that was all over..it was 5:30pm. i got dropped off home, and chris went to pick up his mom at the GO, at 5:30. the good thing is..i came home just in time, before my dad got home..hehe, he came home at 5:40pm. perfect timing=D      &nbsp;

        what a long night..........actually it felt kinda short..it just flew by!! i swear..it was 12am one moment, and the next, it was 8am!! all and the while..i was talking to my BaBy forever..BIGGEST RISK EVER!! I SWEAR I WAS LITERALLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK! I WAS SO SCARED. seee, what happened was that i was online till around 11:45pm, and then got told to go to sleep, so, i went upstairs, and laid on my bed and closed my eyes, and almost fell asleep, but i had a little light on in my room..and i heard someone coming in my room, and i thought it was my mom, so i quickly shut the light off, but it turned out, it was my brother...  "yo Joanna, your "friend" is online"  "whaaaaaaaaaaat? right now?!"  "yeah, you wanna talk to him?"  this is the moment, jO jumps outta bed, out of her room, and runs downstairs to the basement where her brother sleeps. (good thing my dad was already in bed, and my mom was like brushing her teeth or something int he bathroom, they didn' thear me go downstairs) so i get down there (my brother has his own laptop) and started talking to Chris....then we came up with a plan you seee..to stay up all night together talking on msn...the latest we ever stayed up on there was 4am. so what i had to do was hide in my brother's room UNDER HIS DESK, in the dark, so if my mom came into his room, she wouldn't see me. cuz they already think i'm in my room sleeping.  we spent the whole night talking...not closing our eyes, cuz we shut them...they won't open again!! lol. and our hearts would beat so fast, cuz we're so scared for ourselves and each other. if we got caught...we're done for. =S so we spent the whole night talking, and i went back upstairs, at 8am, to my bed..very quietly so no one could hear me..and fell into my bed...and slept..for a total of about 4 hours..i'm going back to bed soon i assure you. hehe. it was SO worth it. nearing the middle of the night i was like talking drunkness...but by the time sunrise hit,...i was so hyper..    "i've never seen this side of you before." -chris  "you've beenwith me 15months, and you've never seen this side of me?! it's gotta be the tiredness, lol"-jO    seee chris, i've told you before...life's all about risks...!! if you ain't going to take risks...don't expect anything to happen. we practically risked our lives. !! lol, the way our parents are..yeah.i would say so. huh, funnie thing actually..we kinda got to know each other even better...despite the 15months...we even got to know how we are without sleep, at 4-8 am..in the morning. haha. i'm going to remember this memory for sure,       "my g/f is giving me girl tips"  NEVER ASK A GIRL HER SIZE  you're buying me CLOTHES!? LOL.  making dreams together then making them come true  PATTERNS!!  past g/f's and b/f's  completely ObLiVIOus  innie/inbetweenies  where's the whipped cream!?   that's all i can remember right now with the lack of sleep..some reason..it all felt like a dream..like it didn't even happen..like the times when you came over..they still feel like dreams too..  i was saving the convo, since i was on my brother's laptop, and put it on word..but at the last couple of minutes..i closed the window b4 i saved..cuz i was too concentrated in planning to how i'm going to get upstairs, and listening for my dad walking around....sorry chris=( oh well. we were talking randomness anyways. lol, the BEST randomness. key thing: at least we didn' tget caught...     "i&nbsp;leave when my dad opens the basement door to come down and go to the bathroom...he opens the door to freedom for me! LOL."    *i need sleep*  &nbsp; urlLink

IT'S BURNING!!! lol..i was like..WHAT THE HELL/. lol...great..now my eye is like full of dirty water. lol, it didn't effect me that much, i ran to the bathroom to wipe my eye up..ewewew...ok, then after i was like..i should pack something to eat at school, cuz obviously i am a human being and i need to eat, and i get hungry..well guess what?? THERE WAS NO BREAD AND NO BAGELS! what is going on here?!?! lol. so i get angry..and thought, i'll just eat breakfast, and not pack anything..so i grab a bowl..and take some cereal..as i was pouring the cereal..IT DROPPED ALL OVER THE FLOOR!! well like..it kinda bounced out of my bowl onto the floor..since when does cereal BOUNCE?! well today..it did..so i finally ate my cereal and went to school (all this happened in less than 30min) crazy..so i go to school..and we had..hmmmm. 2 FIRE ALARMS..what is with this school and fire alarms!? and one of them was right in the middle of a quiz..and the other ..right b4 i suppposed to do my test...so the test got cancelleld..cuz we would've had to write it in like and hour..which is UNLIKELY..and all through the day..i was happy cuz i couldn't wait till the end of the day where i go home..and at 4 or so my baby will come over and see me..hmmm..when i got home tho..i realized..my brother wasn't home.."where's stanley, mom?" *jO reads a note dad left for mom* "what's this?? it says..something..uh.." *it was in chinese. lol* "umm..it says, me and stanley went to peterbrough something for..carsen?" (carsen is the company my dad works at) uh..wait.."if stanely's with dad..doesn't he have to go to work today at like 4?" mom says, "yes he does" jo says "then ...doesn't that mean..dad's going to be home because he's driving stan home? is he goign back to work afterwards?!" *mom phones dad to find out what's going on* "no, your dads coming home right now.." *time..3:00pm* hahahhahaha...WOW. then i had a heartattack, cuz if my dad's home..and he comes..i'm in BIG TROUBLE. so i went up stairs..sat in my room, did "homework" while STARING outside of my bedroom window, to watch for him just incase he came. and then i saw him ride by at like..4:15? hehe..awwwwwwwwww, he had his adidas hat on..and i think he was with his dad..on a bike ride..awwwwwwwwwwwwww, it's a father/son thing. THANKGOD for that, lol. but after at like 4:30, i was THEN homealone. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr..stupid plans screwed up on me..but i can guarenteee..they won't screw up tomorrow..and i hope i have better luck. bad day...veryvery bad day..

        oH yeah..and i almost got my BIKE STOLEN TODAY. seee, i was going to Simon's house right, and i was ringing the doorbell, and you know simon, never answering the door, because he can't "hear it" from the basement...so was standing outside for like 5 min. ringing that doorbell, and suddenly this guy rides past on the other side of the sidewalk, and looks my way, then shouts behind him, "don't do it"...hmmm..sounds kinda fishy to meeee, so i walk back to my back..and there's this girl on the driveway..tiptoeing to my bike,, and was about to pick it up, and i stood there, looking at her..like "what the fuck do you think your doing?"..and she lloked up at me..and right at that moment i know what she was thinking.."shit.." lol..so all she did was like laugh..cuz there was nothing she could say..and she went back to her bike..picked it up..and rode off..well at this time..simon FINALLY came out..and yeah..it all went from there..interesting eh?? now simon's scared that he can' tleave his bike out on his driveway..fear of getting it stolen. haha. "this is bad neighbourhood now...='( now i can't leave my bike out!!" hmmm, reason ithink she wanted to steal my bike was because her's didn't have a seat on it..lol. i noticed that much. plus, i knew who she was ..she goes to pickering, and she was in my business class in grade 10...you know chris? the one who asked for a pencil near the end of the school year out of nowhere when we were at our locker? yeah, THAT girl.

         hmmmmm, so...now i can't go out because i'm a GIRL?! and my brother goes out like every single day. they don't even know where he is right now, and they don't even have a problem with that! i haven't gone out since forever, and if i had asked to go out today, they would've went PSYCHO ON ME. "Girl's aren't supposed to go out" WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!? so what do i do? i stay home. what do i do at home? "clean the house, wash the dishes, vaccuum the house, dust the house, fold the laundry, do the laundry..." why don't i just do EVERYTHING, while my brother is out god knows where, and while my sister stays in her room and goes on her laptop 24/7, and does absolutely nothing?? now you know...now you know why, i go out, when they're not home..

"well check the window" i look out the window, only to see a very familiar bike..IT'S COURTNEY!!=D!! i run downstairs, open the door and can't help but smile=) drop everything, just to come and see me, not telling you're leaving, just to see me. hehe. so crazy. you were lucky my parents weren't home. =) but even if they were..all you would say is.."hey JO!!

BECAUSE HE WAS DRIVING ON THE PARKING SPACES NOT THE FUCKING ROAD, HE HAS NO FUCKING RIGHT TO FUCKING HONK HIS HORN AT HIM. and so...i shouted that out to the dude driving..hahaha..courtney told me to calm down..but i couldn't help it, it made me so mad! he wasn't even driving on the road!! he was driving through the parking spaces!! then we rode back to mullen to swing on our swings and eat, we see 3 different girls in the park playing..with..woodchips? haha  c.moore-"good, our swings are free" we ride up to our swings get off, as i saw the same 3 girls that we saw before walking towards the park..jO-"let's get our swings before those girls take it"..just then..the 3 different girls that were playing in the park..RAN SO FAST AND TOOK OUR SWINGS!! jO-"..or..not.." i swear...DAMN KIDS, STEALING MY SWING, AFTER THEY KNEW I WAS HEADING FOR THEM. courtney-"i swear they were playing in the sand!!" jO-"more like SPLINTER VILLE! i swear, i would push 'em off just to get them..but..*breathe* i won't..stupid kids..I HATE THEM!" courtney-*yells back as we're riding away* "YOU STUPID FUCKING KIDS!!" jO-"HAHAHAHAHAHHA...see, courtney..i swear at them undermy breath. indirectly, but making sure they HEAR me..you...you jus tswear at them DIRECTLY!!!
