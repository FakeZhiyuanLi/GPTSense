      Today was the first day in many moons I dared discuss my dental disaster with another human being.  I know that sounds perhaps trivial to some, but to me it is a monstrous deal.  My mouth is literally falling apart-out of fear and lack of funds.  I have been the unfortunate bloke that in the past received shoddy work from a dentist.  Subsequent visits to miscellaneous practitioners left me 'wary' and skeptical of any dentist who would truly CARE about me & my mouth.  Does that make sense?  It always seemed they cared if I had the money, but when I said I couldn't afford the treatments I was treated as 'less-than' I KNOW I deserved.  Out of desperation for my deteriorating mouth, I wrote several local dentists in San Diego telling them my personal story and asking if they offered reduced or pro-bono fees to help me get my dental health back to where it should be.   THE letter that started it all....    Dear Dr.,  I discovered your name through (various researched articles and websites). I proceeded to view your website, which I was grateful contained actual before and after photos of actual clients with explanations of procedures and CLOSE-UPS of smiles.  I don't know how common or uncommon my story is but I am now in desperation because fear and finances have kept me from acquiring the dental work I desperately need.  My specifics: I am 40 years old, a professional web developer, and single mother of an awesome 14 year old. I had extensive dental work some years ago (1995-1996) by a local north county dentist.  Unfortunately due to his negligent work (the insurance made him pay me back-he is no longer practicing) I have suffered from deteriorating dental health because I am scared to step into a dentist's office. Two years ago I had my front tooth pulled and had two bone grafts done.  I currently I have a "flipper" to replace the front tooth whose root had disintegrated within my gums.  One of the back teeth that holds the flipper up lost a filling awhile back and I have neglected to have it filled and it is breaking off in bits and pieces while I fill it with cotton.  I have lost 3 other teeth, 2 crowns that had come off left the nubs of the teeth not able to hold a crown.  The other tooth was too damaged to keep.  I don't want to lose any more teeth.  I want to be able to smile again, because I truly don't smile with my heart anymore.  I'm afraid to because others might see the recession of the gum line.  I am not an ignorant person, I am educated, own my own business and am proud of the strives and accomplishments I've made since my divorce 4 years ago.  I do however sacrifice a great deal to run my home-based business to stay at home with my daughter whom I have full custody of. I am a supportive soccer mom, play soccer myself, volunteer for community events and am a person of integrity.  My dilemma: The last cosmetic dentist I went to said it would cost $25,000 to remake my mouth.  I had started to have him do minimal work, but he didn't even fix the filling that had fallen out.  I guess I gave up.  I suppose I am poor by society's standards; though I am very rich in many other ways.  Do you or can you offer ANY type of reduced fees or pro bono work for those who qualify?  I've attached a 'far away' photo of myself and my daughter.  I can't smile normally or the gum recession by the non-existent front tooth will show.   I am writing out of desperation and hoping upon hope that you can help me.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.   Today I had an appointment in San Diego at  urlLink Dr. Addleson's office .  An extremely talented dentist/artisan who appears to be an expert at his craft.  I met with his wife and her assistant and what a pleasure to meet people who truly care.  Having been the 'victim' of mental and verbal abuse by my Ex...it appears that I might be eligible for a program that helps domestic violence survivors.  I had to think on that...whether or not I considered myself a survivor.  After discussing it with my daughter and recalling the huge strides her and I have made after leaving my ex...being free from the fear we allowed him to control us with...YES I am a survivor.  So, I will move forward with this development and see where it takes me.    To smile again...what a joy and pleasure that would be.  I hope it's not just a dream.
