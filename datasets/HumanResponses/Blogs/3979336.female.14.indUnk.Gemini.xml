       i'm sorry if i wasn't able to blog for the past few days... i've been busy with school and stuff. I HATE SOCIAL STUDIES! ugh... why? i'll tell you why! math? A- english? A filipino? B CL? A- Science? A- Social?!?!?!?! C!!! ugh... but that's not my grades for the first quarter. that's my mid-quarter grades and i'm so NOT satisfied with my grade in social. imagine, i studied REALLY hard. and i'm dead serious. hard enough that my brains were already complaining! hard enough that i didn't have enough time to eat, sleep, talk, chat, etc! but was i productive?!?! nope!!! i got a 21/40. oh wow... i'm so damn happy. (in case you're so damn slow i'm being sarcastic) why did i get such grades? cause i totally mix up tagalog words. for example, how many times do they trade? my answer was "bawat linggo" and it was wrong!!! but the answer actually meant ONCE A WEEK! damn... okay, enough of this! this won't help me get higher grades in Social... i'll just talk to Ms. Derije tom.     &nbsp;   okay... EMERGENCY! i have to write this paper for CL!!! Bye! Love yah!:)     &nbsp;

       i hate them! why did God create them anyway? i know that snakes have a purpose in life... but cockroaches? hmm... they have no purpose in life (for me)! ugh... and can't WE fly instead? cause i think it would be a really prettier sight to see a girl like me flying than an ugly cockroach! ugh... are you wondering why i'm suddenly talking about cockroaches? a while ago our school walk thingy above the overpass was dominated by those ugly insects. imagine how scared i was! i panic at the sight of 1 tiny cockroach, what more 5? 6? ugh! change topic!    &nbsp;  i'm researching on the tribe ibanag right now. the men are allowed to have more than 1 wife. o...k... muslims are also allowed to have plenty of wives, right??? hmm... why would someone want to have several wives? do they actually LOVE their wives? i don't know... cause if you love someone you'd be satisfied to have him/her as your life-time partner. right? oh whatever. i don't have plans to get married to someone who has plenty of wives anyway... never!    &nbsp;  newsflash people! friendster is SO boring. and its so JOLOGS already. why? cause the desperate people are dominating friendster already. i'm not kidding! what do i mean by "desperate people" people who would actually send you messages telling you they love you when they don't even know you. people who want to be your boyfriend KAHIT SA FRIENDSTER LANG!&nbsp;how pathetic can someone get? before i'd receive only 40+ messages from those type of people. now my inbox is flooding. eww...    &nbsp;  i'll end this entry... baboosh! oh yeah...    &nbsp;  special mention to den:) hey bunshie!:) love u!:) hehehe... and to klohdie, i hope you won't get sick!:( basta... take good care of your self. love you:)    &nbsp;  bye readers!:) i love you all!:)
