      In our english class we have to read a book called  The Age of Innocence . It is the gayest book i have ever read. IT is about New york during the 1870's and it is trying to tell the story of a young man that is engaged to a young woman but whose engagment is propbably going to be broken up by the afore mentioned young woman's cousin. It is a story that uis deffinately not propperly represented by its title or the cover art and it is one great example of the old axiom "Do not judge a book by its cover". This book is one of the most boring stories i have ever read. I understand that my English teacher will read this but i dont care. I skipped whole pages of most of the 5 out of the 11 chapters we had to read and i didnt lose anything from the story. The whole story seems to be a fairly linear story with no side development and it is my only hope that the story will grow into a more developed story.

      "Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me" a small rhyme that has been in existance for who knows how long. It is a phrase that tries to say that you cannot hurt me with anything that you might say. In a way this is a truth. Talking in a strictly physical manner the words cannot hurt anyone, they can however hurt peoples feelings and even permanently scar them. This is a terrible way to hurt people broken bones heal but hurting someones feelings is a very serious matter. I have been bullied since i was in elementary school so I can sympathize with anyone who has gone through this and while it has many unwanted side affects such as the emotional damage and scarring in my case is has also caused a hardenning of feelings that can also be unwanted but that can also be seen as a preperation for what is reffered to as the real world because unlike our sheltered existance with our schools and living with our parents we will be on our own and be exposed to things that we have never experienced and will be exposed to the harsh realities of life. So even though we preach that we should protect our children from all emotional damage it can help if the child is raised with the propper temperment and with caring parents to help them through it.

      "Eat every sandwich" is a phrase that has been repeated in many forms. Such forms are things such as "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may" or even the original saying that all of these come from "Carpe Dium" which is a latin phrase that means "Sieze the Day". It tells you to take as much out of life as you can. That is a sentiment that is needed to be told to all people and that must be reciprocated throughout all of humanities history. This sentiment si what drives people such as JFK and other great figures. If we follow this advice we can take advantages of as many opportunities in our lives as we possibly can.

      I was over at a friends house this weekend and while I was there something very unusual happened. While driving back from the local mall we had turned on to the country highway that his house is off of and while we were driving down we happened to see a very large plane very close to the ground. We decided that the plane was likely to crash. So what did we do? We GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE!! Now when i say a very large plane i am reffering to the fact that it was a Jumbo Jet that means thatit was a Boeng 747 jet or larger. To give you an idea a B747 is about two football fields long with two jet engines on each wing. And when i say close to the ground i mean that it was about ten thousand feet up and dropping rappidly. Now i know ten thousand feet seems like a lot but not when the plane was probbably dropping at about 600 feet a second(that is amazingly fast) we were lucky enough that the pilot of said plane must be a genius when it comes to well piloting planes because they were able to recover and fly off while slowly climbing. To emphasize how unusual this is we live in Middle of Nowhere USA there is not an airport that can support a Boeing 747 for at least 40 to 50 miles. This experience has given me more than enough excitment for the next couple of weeks.

         BEWARE   : I wish all of you who read this to remember that    I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN   , and that this is meant to be inofensive if any of you find it offensive you can contact me to tell me so at jasonadaugherty@yahoo.com to give me your feedback.   Today in english i heard a couple of songs from a christian band. I do not normally listen to this kind of music but the two songs i heard today were some of teh most beautiful songs that i have ever heard. I speak of the beauty of the song not in the beauty of the words or even the sound of the music i am speaking of the feeling behind the music and the general feeling of hope and love behind it. It was a group that i will assume makes music that sounds similar to the type of sonfs that Eminem produces. I do not listen to him either so i would not know. But the feeling of the song was one of hope for the salvation of a soul that they believed was lost but still had the chance to come home to its maker. It also expressed a feeling of great respect for Eminem as a man but a feeling of sadness over the kind of role model that Eminem is giving all of the young people of america. This song is the pinacle of what i see as good in the christian faith. Many of the things that different parts of the christian faith evangelize I do not believe in but this is the sentiment that I believe each and every person should follow no matter what religion, race, or other beliefs they are. This sentiment is one of a godly manner. If every single person in the world followed this we sould have solved a lot of our problems by now and we would not have to worry about the global terrorism we fear or worry about many of the crimes that we have in abundance now. Keep in mind if you reread this article that i am not one to talk. I judge people, I hold grudges, I am a perfect example of the inherent flaw in the human system or in other words someone who can talk but cant quite back up what i say with words. While i try to be the best person i possibly can you can ask any of my friends that i have known and they will tell me i am one of the most flawed people they have ever met. But I do not say that i am perfect though it may seem that that is how i come off. I want to tell anyone who thinks like this band and especially all of my friends that share this bands ideals that they dont have to change, they need to spread that feeling of love for your fellow man no matter what they do. You are the people that I have the greatest respect for because it is they who hold the hope and they who hold the greatness of all man

      Hey im in the band and today we had our yearly concert band festival. That means we traveled an hour away on the bus to play three pieces of music in front of three old guys so that they could rate us. We also got to play two pieces of music we had never seen before today and get rated on how well we played those. Anyway well the rating system goes from wort score to best as follows: poor, fair, good, excellent, superior. For the past few years we have been making goods and last year we barely pulled off an excellent rating overall. This year however we got a new band director and we got not only an overall superior rating but got straight superiors every single judge gave us a superior rating it was awesome. This means we can go to state concert festival and this is the first time our concert band has   ever   gotten straight superiors in its 50 year life. So if you couldnt tell im kinda excited. Well its gettin late ill talk to ya later.

      We were reading a new book in class a couple of days ago it is "Of Mice and Men" and while we were reading it some kids in my class started laughing at one of the characters. The characters name is Lennie he is a mentally retarded adult. Well the class was laughing at the way he acted and this made me extremely angry. Normally i am a very pacifistic person but this made me border on physical violence. I finnaly calmed down and realized why this is. I am a very sensitive person when it comes to the mentally retarded. From third grade through fifth grade i worked with students at a local school for the handicapped and during this time I learned that people with those kind of disorders are the sweetest, kindest, most loving people in the world and I do not like it when others laugh at these pure people. Now just to make it clear i am not accusing anyone in my class and I apologize if I offend anyone in my class but i am just expressing my feeling at the time.

      The school years over we all have the next two and a half months to take off and get in some fun and sun between work days right? Wrong(at least for me). Just to prove to all of my friends just how much of a nerd i am i went and got accepted into a 7 week program at UF that is basically an entire semester at school. So because of this i have just two weeks of actual vacation before i go off to college and i get back less than a week before we return to school and only two days before my first band rehearsal. Sounds like fun doesnt it. But then again you have to look at it as being away from sisters and parents for almost two months while living in dorms on a college campus. Maybe its not so bad after all. Well talk to ya later.

      Hello peoples. Just another normal day up here in Gainesville. It was hot, It rained, I had to do work, I got yelled at and insulted. Nothing new. Well hopefully everyone elses day went better than mine.  Oh and i had a question posted about my last post so i'll clarify it here. Yes you all read correctly and it was not a typo i said girlfriend. Now while i have only been out on 1 date with this girl i have been courting her since the begining of the school year so i feel comfortable calling her that. But the question was who am i "going out" with. The answer, for Lisa and anyone else who was curiosis, is that I am "going out" with Alycia Keller. She is going to be a junior this year she goes to my high school, lil ol' umatilla, and she is in band with me. So if in this upcoming year you see me walking around with a brunette that is probably her. Anyway im gonna go. TTFN. Ta Ta For Now.  P.S. Lisa i like your blog especially the picture but that expertise that is something i never knew about you.

      Here's a quote i saw on my girlfriend's website that i thought was quite poignant.  " Your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become your habits. Your habits become your values. Your values become your destiny." - Mahatma Gandhi
