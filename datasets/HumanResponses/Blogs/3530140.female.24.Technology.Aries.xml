      And I'm back. You don't realize how much you depend on the internet until you don't have it anymore. It's like taking away TV! eGad. My three week hiatus was not completely due to the lack of connection. I've been living my work. It owns me. This past week especially has been most tiresome. First, I must admit I'm not a morning person. Strange, I know. This means that work doesn't typically start at 8am for me. Add 30 minutes to that and you have programmer hours. Imagine my horror when we were ordered, not told, to be ten minutes early to our week long Java class that started at 8am. But luckily it was scheduled to end at 4. Was that why we were all still doing labs at 5:30 in the evening? My college years passed before my eyes. Suddenly I had a renewed craving for coffee and ramen noodles. That's nothing, you say? Why yes, I would have to agree except for the minor detail that normal work continued to happen outside the realm of college land. Therefore, even though I left at 5:30 in the evening, my work day didn't end until 10pm. Rinse and repeat. Friday had never looked so good and I'm glad I made it.  Before I crash and burn in my bed, I have to share a story. The trainer of this Java class was your typical computer nerd/freak. He was very knowledgeable in the topic of discussion, but delivery was dry and calculated. Through the week, we had gotten to know him pretty well and today, he felt most comfortable with us for on the way back from lunch he asked the driver to whip out some eminem. Shy, reserved computer freak teacher became a playa hatin' cracka. The situation peaked at the moment when he attempted to keep the beat by snapping his fingers. I'll never be able to listen to 'Cleanin Out My Closet'with a straight face again. Mr. Trainer IS the rap lovin' movie character from Office Space. A perfect way to end a Friday.  Fatigued, Pinkie

      I'm having serious internet issues. Stay tuned for more updates. Don't touch that dial.  Aggravated, Pinkie

      I'm unexpectedly troubled by the death of our former president, Ronald Reagan. I was engrossed in CNN Saturday afternoon as White House correspondent after correspondent recalled their memories of him. I was touched. I didn't even know him, yet there was something about him that hit home.  He was the first president I recognized and admired. This is not because I knew what voodoo economics meant at the age of 6 but because he held a position of influence and in a way, reminded me of my grandfather. Reagan had amazing charisma, contagious charm, and added a political flavor as an American Cowboy -- the heroic definition of good vs. evil. At the end of his days, I'm sure all of those memories were unreachable to him. Sad.  Perhaps that is what bothers me most. My grandpa forgets things from time to time. We all do and it doesn't get any better the older we get. I realized about a year ago, how little I actually knew of the history of both sets of grandparents and even my parents. You hear stories as you grow up, but half listen. They seem to mean more now. I sometimes worry that I won't have enough time to collect those stories and ask questions. It's a valuable resource you can't afford to lose, but often forget you have access to.  I actually have a piece of Reagan memorabilia. My grandparents saw him when he was in North Platte and brought me back a red bandana souvenir. I remember thinking that was the neatest thing in the world. It's a memory that will always link the two together. Maybe it is another reason why I think of Reagan kindly.  Here's to you, Dutch. Your legacy is forever. Warmly, Pinkie

      I have mapped out my reading course for the next several months. This should be interesting. I'm notorious for starting a book and then not finishing it. Partially because I become bored with it, but mostly I just don't have the time. Lately I've been flipping furiously through techie books in order to quickly pick up new concepts for a project. Usually that kind of learning is fun. However, lately it just seems to add stress.  My journey to Barnes & Noble today has sparked a desire to do more personal reading this summer. Lately I've felt like this horrible let down to society because my repertoire of books does NOT include many of the classics. There are so many fantastic novels out there that I haven't even touched. I'm almost embarrassed because of it. I don't count the required readings in high school and college, as if some of those are noteworthy any way. Reading for enjoyment and reading because you have to are two different things. Anyway, Barnes & Noble is running this fantastic book deal for many literature classics. Buy 2, get the 3rd free. I love a good deal! So, for my reading enjoyment and curiosity, I've picked up the following:  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe The Time Machine and The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells Beginning J2EE 1.4 (Ok,ok. I couldn't resist the Java book. It was on sale!)  My current problem is deciding on which one to read first. I'm stuck between Chuck Dickens and Wells. I highly suggest taking up on this book offer. It ends July 1st. Run to a local Barnes & Noble near you! They're everywhere. Just like Starbucks.  Enjoy the moment and seize a good book. Challengingly, Pinkie

      I finally did it. I'm 24 years old and I officially started my first blog. It wouldn't be half as embarrassing had my field of interest not be technology.  While I'm on the subject of catching up, I took the advice of a friend and rented Sex and the City, Season One .. for the first time. Ever. I had no idea what I was missing. It's the anthem for women singletons across america. So maybe I don't live in the glamorous New York City. And maybe my Manolo Blahnik's are actually discounted Franco Sarto shoes at DSW. Perhaps more appropriately stated, my life melodrama is ..and the City. The sex part seems to be obsolete. It's an equal trade for five dollar Starbuck's coffee ice cream and a queen sized bed all to myself.  I'm content. My date this evening is sleek, sexy, and obeys my every command. I'm in love with my laptop. And as I sit on my patio composing this blog, I feel content. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. So here's to all the women and their personal version of Sex and the City, Celibacy and the Farm Town, Singletons and the Married...  Thoughtfully, Pinkie
