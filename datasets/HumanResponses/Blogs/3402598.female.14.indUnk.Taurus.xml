      To be Frank I am ashamed of the dreams I had last night.  Not only were they not original but they took place in my old house.  I feel that when things happen in my neighboorhood my mind is too tired to create soemthing new.  Also I awoke several times knowing I had not been dreaming.   In the First dream I was mearly yelling out my feelings to family then running in the direction I normally run.  The only things I was happy about was one: that I realized I always run that direction and I turned around. Two: that I realized I was dreaming when I was asleep and Three: That when I was not dreaming I was just in a black nothing and I wanted to dream so bad that I forced myself awake.  I hope I can put more control into my dreams.  One problem is that school is coming soon and I do not know how I will record my dreams and also I wonder how school will affect my sleep.  Pardon my Rants on stupid subjects.  Till then  Marie Sinclair

      Finished Number 44 but Mark Twain.  It makes you think  In the wonderful way.  It reminded me when I was younger and was completely serious when I thought maybe no one else has any thought. Maybe It's just me and everyone else is just in my imaginations.  I was convinced until someone just said I had an overactive imagination.  Then I gave up.  44 makes you think that again.  That maybe this is just a single thought.  Or maybe this is just a single person in the middle of no where.  Thinking it all up.  That we cannot feel that this is a dream because we have never woken up.  Then I think of the quote   'Are you dreamwaking through reality or wake walking through dreams?'   Are the dreams we are having truer than what we really see now?  Like someone said to me    'You go to bed in the evening and you think you don't exist so you go to sleep.  Then you wake up in the morning and the first think you think of is something completely noncoherent with your last thought, but it is a thought none the less so now you are back.  You may not have existed last night  But now you think so you exist now.'   Then there's the other theory which I am not sure whether to dive into or watch from the side pondering the faults and flaws.  The theory which is simply  if you believe in something it becomes so.'  that's saying that if you hope for something to happen your letting it happen that if you believe something can happen that is enough power to make it happen and if you doubt something that power is negative and it causes that to happen. Its not whether or not someone is going to pick your name or whether someone is going to  hurt another person. It's just the power of the wish.   As far fetched as these may seem. It seems closer than the idea of someone sitting on a cloud watching everyone and anyone at the exact moment and being able to grant wishes only if you are good to them.   It seems that most people who believe in god choose not to believe in him but choose to believe that when you die you won't just not exist anymore.   It seems that that thought is too hard for some minds to compehend and so they make up ideas that make them seem better and make them believe that once they die they are going to keep everything just the way they please.   Forgive me for ranting. But that's just how my mind works when it reads this book. It's wonderful. Twisting minds and everything.    Till then Marie Sinclair

      Now that I have started recording dreams I start to recognize places.  Like The most common  A beach city.  In the south is a rainy swamp that's an olive green.  It has no sign of life anywhere.  If you walk far enough it will be grassy and flat.  To the northeast is a boardwalk.  It's never sunny there. Somewhat rainy and dull.  On the board walk is a lot of shops. One is a building that is the size of two classrooms.  Shelves are lined with small moose on the top. There's a rack for sunglasses.  It's always full.  Further north is the beach it has small kiosks on the high sand. Colorful kiosks.  The beach is plain. But something important.  You can never feel the temperature there.  This is someplace new.  Then there's the dock  just a dock wooden with a dojo behind it water lines it 3 docks go out of the main boardwalk the middle one has a broken plank that I have fallen in before. From underneath you can see the people above it. I have not used it in a while.  Then there's places that I have been in real life.   I hope by harnessing where I am I can control my sleeping body as well as my waking.  Last night was the closest I have come.  I convinced myself I was dreaming and proved it. But then I awoke. I wonder if that is because it was morning or because I knew it was not real.

      Dream One:  Walking home on the side of the road He pulls up I can't tell who is who I get in He drives me home We pass the cemetery We stop We get out I ring the buzzer Door opens He follows I walk forward He follows I ask what he is doing He says he is walking me home Horn Honks  Dream Two:  I'm at a beach house He is there with someone else They are walking on edge of river I walk behind carrying cat He doesn't notice I let cat down to run home She runs out into water Then runs into forest He smiles And helps me We walk into forest He pretends he found it It is an Easter egg full of grass I walk away bemused I see kittens I grab blue ones Hand them to him Walk further litter litters river bed I bend to pick up and grab another kitten I find cat but    it turns   around a bend .   Dream 3.  Familiar landscape  Beach  I have been here in other dreams  I walk to friend 'Want to go swimming?'says I 'I just went. But I will go again' says he  I grab phone and keys  And jump out the window on my bike  again I recognize this landscape  I swerve past cars  and end at a beach  that was the short way  I rush forward and pick up a pink stone in the shape of a cat  I show it to my friend  He bites it  I smile  I dive under  Then I realize I am not wet.  I am dreaming.  This is a dream  And I woke up.

      Dream:  Last night my dreams were abler   Strange things that seemded so real.  A friend quoting song lyrics    to a man    I think she loved him   she said to him:    I've got a short skirt  and    a    looonnng jacket.     I remember cooking for myself but not knowing what to make  and finally deciding on clam chowder.  oh it was such a blur of things.   I will have to remember soon.  there was something urgent in it.  that I cannot remember.  &#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;&#9827;  Andy Kaufman  is a debate   I cannot help  but be interested in.  surely he couldn't be alive after all these years?  It's like claiming Kurt Cobain was walking down the streets of Chicago.  While its easy to call yourself someone in real life if you look alike  It's even easier to call yourself someone online.   Where no one can see you.  I vote that Andy Kaufman is still dead and will remain so until the end of time.    Thank You  ××××  Marie

      Last night.  In dreamland  or wake land. ..  .  I was walking with a friend.   Someone I once loved.   And we sat down.   There were people coming.  Famour politions that I didn't know.  He was sitting next to me  I shivered.    One woman came up to me   and said her name   I  gasped.   It was her.   Her next to me next to him next to me   She passed me a note and walked away.     'Don't worry.  I can see it in the way he sits. He love's you more than you think.'     I smiled.   We walked to a home.  It must have been my family house out of town.  I walked around and went to a small room.  Then the bedroom.   We were giddy with sssssecrecy.   I knew my cousin was gone   She had school.   Her room was gorgerous.   Bright    Hallway.   A Bright Hallway   With a bad on the side of the wall.  She was there.   OH.   we   were so  so  ever so      Giddy.   In the opposite  I walked to class where I see him   He wasn't there..

      Last night I had a dream that I was walking down the long street.  I had seen it before.  I know I have.  It was like a path I had taken before.  Only Mirror Image.  And I found a building full of things I would never by but spend hours thinking about.  And I saw friends.  And I saw him.  The guy everyone dreams about.  In my dream.  was the guy I was always afraid of.  We talked.  And Walked.  And then more friends.  But when everyone walked away  I knew something was    amiss    They walked on a boat  And I followed  It was a place I knew I had been  A few years ago.  A river or steam filled with lily pads and the sides were rice plants.    In the middle of the path was a clear area.   r  i  v  e  r l m l  c  l m l l u l  l  l u l l d l  e  l d l l d l  a  l d l    l y l  n  l y l    l   l     l   l   That I longed to swim in.  So I said so.  He nodded.  Then I saw what everything else  and i took it back  he nodded  and we went on the boat   to the sun rise.    ×××××  When I awoke   I saw him that day  I glanced at him   He glanced  away .

      My eyes, are they red? Like I've been crying? Or standing over a fire of old photographs?  Beg pardon but is my voice cracking? Like I've been screaming? Or singing the lonely night love song?     Someone once told me the best time to fly away is when its raining  cos no one seems to look up when its pouring in their face.  And I told them if I were to fly away no one would see me b/c I'd fly away to find them  Someone once told me the best time to run away is when someone has just returned  cos people seem not to care about anybody else when someone that has been gone suddenly returns.  And I told them if I were to run away no one would notice me.  Someone once told me the if I were to take a  picture  do it when nothings happening   cos things seem to happen when you least expect them  And then I told them if you expect  something  to happen when you least expect it to its better off to just take the picture when you don't expect anything.  Someone once told me that if I were to fall in love do it  with  someone whos already in love.  cos that way you'll never have to remember that he once  love d you.   And  then I told them if I ever fell in love that person would never even know my name  Someone once told me that if I broke someone's heart be sure to do it to someone's whos heart has already been broken.  Cos that way no one new would have to suffer the shattering of their soul  And then I told him that if I ever broke someone's heart I'd be breaking my own  Someone once told me if I learned the number of seconds before the  lightning  struck I'd know everything   Cos everyone knows something and lightning is everyone  And I told them that I already knew everything that I could learn.  Someone once told me that if I knew everything I should just go crazy.   Cos there would be nothing for me to miss.  And I told him I planned to  do exactly that .

      lets begin again shall we?  something we wont forget.   I had a dream last night.  I was in a park with a family I had never seen before, I was walking to somewhere even though I knew it was a circle.   And While I walked I saw these beasts but even though I was alone nothing happen.     But I ran anyways.     Fast.   In a circle.  Then I was walking with family.  Then I was walking with a cousin.  Then I was walking with a dog.  Then I was alone   In a circle   just around  and around   and around  But suddenly there was something new.   It was a ... museum? or an art show.  Filled with childs things.  Everything was so real and strange  and childlike  And I walked ahead looking at the lights and tile.  I saw the mother of the family I didn't know.   And suddenly I was running from her.   Everything I did had to be far away from her.  So i ran.  And I knew she followed.   And When I awoke the next morning.   I forgot all about it.    I was thinking.   Later on earlier in the week.    About this:   Here we have a world where we use insults that would never be said years ago.  But years before those years ago they were simple things to say.  And when we look at those people we think of them as so filled with hate and so evil.  But when we compare the two together..we say we say it. but dont mean it.  So how can we say something we don't mean then riddicule others when they do the same?    ×   ×  ×  ×   Somethings I noticed while doing nothing.  Today we make millions of films.  Today Yesterday tomorrow and the day after. Horror History SciFi Porn Humour Musicals Noir .. ect.  But with so many movies not all of them can be watched.  So we al know a select few are watched and a even fewer amount is noticed.   But the most sucessful ones of the ones watched aren't about the furute or the day before it or even the present.  They are from way back when everything waas simple and handwashed.  So if the world wants to see the past.    Why don't we stop ..   making the future?    or    Why don't we stop  ruining the present?

      Dream   I was in some sort of a contest  If you did all the things that he asked you to  You woulnd't have to drink the blood.  I drank it anyways  And  While  I drank baking oil poured over my head  I tried to ignore it  Someone told me to wash it out  It could be dangerous  I washed it out but told them it wasn't  because of them   I saw friends on the other side of the glass  I waved and hugged them  I said goodbye and   walked

      Don't ask me, I can't remember.   Standing Here In Some Conversation He doesn't want to be here She doesn't want to go What a Strange life to live I can't imagine what pills I would have to take to Dream this They used to love each other But now they have to hide Everyone can see just what they mean To Do But everyone is kinder here And everyone won't talk about it Till They've left the room Panic Attacks All Around Hide them behind your eyes And see how long it has to be before you scream This seems like someone I knew Then I realize I'm still talking to them I nod and walk away    Twisted Organs wrap around my neck Even if I wanted to be free.. You've tied these knots too tight Knowing what was to come Would have ruined this I'm standing on a wooden plank Dizzy in the breeze I was watching you while you slept Your breathe was steady Your eyes were darting underneath your lids That was until I drove my knife into your knee I hope when you woke up You knew it was from me I'm too tired to tell the whole story And what was your name again? I didn't here it quite clearly Something about your broken neck might have slurred things I'm sorry I have to go But I trust our dinner date for Thursday is still in effect.

      Dream  It was so clear when I didn't have time to write it down.   I remember   Children  Took a dog and put it in a hole.  Then buried it under cement  They claimed he was hurting them  I cried  The puppies just laid there  I revealed A secret that wasn't true  They said they were sorry but shrugged it off  There was a contest blurred..  I didnt want to complete in it.  Someone scolded me..     Blurred

      Away. For a bit.  spent a lot of time thinking.  don't remember most of it  One topic:  The woman stereotype.  How did it begin?   In the cavemen times stereotypes couldn't really have started .  Cos if women started off then doing certain tasks we can't really blame the men.  and by acting different then the men and trying to get our rights but still separating ourselves we are separating ourselves while trying to put us together.

      I am sorry I have forgotten or more to the point I have forced it out of my head I'm so unsure of how to avoid this conversation I recognize the start of the words I see you practicing the speech you planned out in your head But I know we'll both work to avoid this conversation Things just aren't as before In more ways than one I'm sure you've felt this way more than once But for now I don't want to hear Your lame attempts of putting me behind you This isn't a love song This never was a tragedy Just because you hid it behind you and use it as a secret weapon The bleeding won't stop and I'm afraid to show you In case you'll turn away I write these letters Like your speechs Some day I'll think of them But for now I'll simply regret starting this trend in your eyes

      In a sudden burst  I ignorance the phone  and awaiting arguments and scratched down words I hoped I would find later on.   I did   Notes:      if someone where to go into the past from the future to change the present    the present would be changed  thus if this happened we wouldn't know  we would have to e future had already happened  the past would change and new versions of ourselves would be made.  thus   if the past were changed we would never know if   we did something to start over start over all over again.   as foolish as it sounds...   this is the first time I have realized this...

      I've been biting my finger. Hoping no ones seen me. I've been hiding my face Hoping no one recognizes me.   I feel  ..twisted.   I feel  like two different people.  I supposed everyone feels like that.  But It's driving me  insane .   OH man OH man.   How I wish I could act normal.  But normal for them isn't normal for me.  Twisted.   Dreams:  All I can remember is standing at the bathroom mirror wishing I had lipstick and a dark room with 6-7 beds. The Third from the left was unfolded.  And something strange happened.  I remember the thoughts that I had.   'I hope no one had sex in these beds. Because then I'd have to sleep on the floor.'   I have no idea    why that bothered me    so   much?   Thoughts:  I wish that the person I marry could have met my younger self.  In his current state.  Because I find that children seem to see what adults cannot.  they see the flaws that no one else but children could see.

              I touch the fire, and it freezes me        I look into it, and it's black        Why can't I feel?        My skin should crack and peel        I want the fire back        Now, through the smoke, she calls to me        To make my way across the flame        To save the day        Or maybe melt away        I guess it's all the same        So I will        Walk through the fire        'Cause where else can I turn?        I will        Walk through the fire        And let it... The torch I bear is scorching me        Drawn to the fire        Some people...        She will never learn And she will        Walk through the fire        and let it...        Walk through the fire        So one by one, they turn from me        I guess my friends can't face the cold        What can't we face?        But why I froze,        Not one among them knows        And never can be told        She came from the grave much graver        One by one, they come to me        First, he’ll kill her, then I’ll save her        Everything is turning out so dark        Going through the motions        What's it going to take to strike a spark?        It's what they have inside        She will come        These endless days        Are finally ending in a blaze  And we are        Caught in the fire        The point of no return        So we will        Walk through the fire        And let it burn        Let it burn        Let it burn        And let it burn!

              I died        So many years ago        You can make me feel        Like it isn't so        And why you come to be with me        I think I finally know        mmm-mmm         You're scared        Ashamed of what you feel        And you can't tell the ones you love        You know they couldn't deal        Whisper in a dead man's ear        It doesn't make it real        That's great         But I don't wanna play        'Cause being with you touches me        More than I can say        And since I’m only dead to you        I’m saying stay away and        Let me rest in peace         Let me rest in peace        Let me get some sleep        Let me take my love and bury it        In a hole 6-foot deep        I can lay my body down        But I can't find my, sweet release        So let me rest in peace         You know,        You got a willing slave        You just love to play the thought        That you might misbehave        Till you do,        I'm telling you        Stop visiting my grave        Let me rest in peace         I know I should go        But I follow you like a man possessed        There's a traitor here beneath my breast        And it hurts me more than you've ever guessed        If my heart could beat, it would break my chest        but I can see you're unimpressed        So leave me be and         Let me rest in peace        Let me get some sleep        Let me take my love and bury it        Im a hole 6-foot deep        I can lay my body down        But I can't find my sweet release        Let me rest in peace        Why won't you        Let me rest in peace?

       Everytime I draw the curves of your faces   My hand starts to shake and my mind is lost in haze   I've stolen and betrayed everyone I knew   Back in the Day when fishes used to sing   Whenever I see that face of yours at that angle that it has   I get a flash and see just what it was that I did    Back in the Day when tongues were sliced just like heads   I've been faced with a situation like this before   I have to bit my cheek just so I won't blurt out the answers   You told me we were going looking   But then it ended and we had to go   But don't you start crying    I'll sing you to sleep   A lullaby of lies   A Serande of somber stories   A ballad of fabricated awareness   Happy every holiday   I'll see you next year   I have to say I regret not booking my plane later   But every time I see you my eyes get the jitters   And I can't stay here like that

          As I woke from my passing dreams of politics and science. I nudged my foot in the direction of my cat.      I looked deep into it's eyes and I told it the most important thing I will ever tell anyone.         "Go back to Kansas Dorthy, Just go, back to Kansas."         Then I realized what I wanted.      The Kansas that I was searching for was Oz.      Then I lowered my head in submission and fell back to dreaming of lost innocence and babbles of soap scum.          ...'I bent my head over to grab an item of importance to me and as if in a daze. I remembered something. A dream within a dream. Something that for that second felt so entirely like reality. It was something so important that I probably will never be able to remember the plot line again'... So I got to thinking, as thinking is something I pride myself in, and I thought if something that wasn't even an actual dream, just a dream within a dream.  Well then could this very second you or I read this be actually an hour or a second or a second (and them some) in some other field? Sure, In our heads things seem so very real but...doesn't everything seem so very real?           In a way I want to find something else to devote my attentions to but , in another way  I so very much want to solve this puzzle..to open this box of mysteries...

      When you wake from dreams... You assume everything is ok, exactly as you left it all before sleep. But .. sometimes, you're not that lucky...You assume...everything is okay.

        How oft when men are at the point of death        Have they been merry! which their keepers call      A lightning before death. O, how may I      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.      Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?      O, what more favour can I do to thee      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain      To sunder his that was thine enemy?      Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,      Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe      That unsubstantial Death is amorous,      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?      For fear of that I still will stay with thee      And never from this palace of dim night      Depart again. Here, here will I remain        With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here      Will I set up my everlasting rest      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!      Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on      The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!      Here's to my love! O true apothecary!      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.            What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?      Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.      O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop      To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.      Haply some poison yet doth hang on them     To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]      Thy lips are warm!         Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!                                              This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.                   She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].                                                                                                                                                                        This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.      'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.      Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.                                          Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;      And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,      Who here hath lain this two days buried.      Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;      Raise up the Montagues; some others search.                                                                                                      We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,      But the true ground of all these piteous woes      We cannot without circumstance descry.      Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?    Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'      Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,      With open outcry, toward our monument.    Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?    Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;      And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,      Warm and new kill'd.    Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.    Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,      With instruments upon them fit to open        These dead men's tombs.    Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!      This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house      Is empty on the back of Montague,      And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!    Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell      Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,      Till we can clear these ambiguities        And know their spring, their head, their true descent;      And then will I be general of your woes      And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,      And let mischance be slave to patience.      Bring forth the parties of suspicion.    Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,      Yet most suspected, as the time and place      Doth make against me, of this direful murther;      And here I stand, both to impeach and purge      Myself condemned and myself excus'd.    Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.    Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.      I married them; and their stol'n marriage day      Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,        Betroth'd and would have married her perforce      To County Paris. Then comes she to me      And with wild looks bid me devise some mean      To rid her from this second marriage,      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.      Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)      A sleeping potion; which so took effect      As I intended, for it wrought on her      The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo      That he should hither come as this dire night      To help to take her from her borrowed grave,      Being the time the potion's force should cease.      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone      At the prefixed hour of her waking      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.      But when I came, some minute ere the time        Of her awaking, here untimely lay      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth      And bear this work of heaven with patience;      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.      All this I know, and to the marriage      Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life      Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,      Unto the rigour of severest law.        Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,      Their course of love, the tidings of her death;      And here he writes that he did buy a poison      Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal      Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.      Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,      See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,      That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!      And I, for winking at you, discords too,      Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.    Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.      This is my daughter's jointure, for no more        Can I demand.    Mon. But I can give thee more;      For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,      That whiles Verona by that name is known,      There shall no figure at such rate be set      As that of true and faithful Juliet.    Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!    Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.      The sun for sorrow will not show his head.      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;       For never was a story of more woe       Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.                                                      Exeunt omnes.

      The world was going to cave in  Mud was flowing in  from all sides  But I headed far  There was evacuation  Through the cool blue water  And yellow kayaks  I ran away and jumped down the path  but I took the wrong one  And I ended up in an office  I went crazy  seeing myself in a new angle  grabbed everything but a boat.  I flew down the slide  and grabbed a paper plate  and watched as I floated in a circle and    the others floated away.

      I did makeup for the actor.  He shrugged it off and walked away.  I angrly stormed back to my seat. The metal chair clanged when I dropped into it.   How dare he do that What does he think he is   Everyone   avoided  me.  I swtepped out onto the stage and followed the simply ways.  Left. Right. Right. Backwards. Right Right. Backwards.

      I knew this place. I had come here before ..Walking.  I stopped at a store I had seen before.  The necklace was sold out.  OH well..  I turned, A military building was burning, to the ground. I ran when I heard the yelling.   The Plays, the plays are burning.   I was interested. I ran to it but found, to my dismay, that it was not really them.  In the smoking ruins someone I knew stood.       upset   We volunteered to help.  We scavened through boxes. Laughed at images.  Then we sat and ate.  I pulled a yellow cake with chocolate chips marked under the colum suicide and coconut macaroons from despair.  The silver tray spun, but I turned and sat back down.  I worried no one would know I was not dead.  Oh well.  I walked out the door

      I had memories already A life Planned out  I had recently arrived from a trip but I was going back again.  I started packing my bags but then I discovered I had left battereies behind  I'd pick them up at the airport.  People lived at the airport and I talked to friends and saw people I knew. It was like a class  I put my bags down in the 17th aisle of an auditorium.  And Walked away.   <><> <>  I was on the moon   floating  Watching so I would not be seen  I ran down an aisle until a friend fell  We yelled at him  Get up  Get up  Get up  Get up  Then I did  ><><>  Theres more but I feel like I should not reveal it for now.

      Segments of my dreams for the past week   or so   I. Its a park  or museum  I'm walking around  looking at all of the exhibits  I vaguely see people I vaguely know  We walk through a long glass tunnel  With animals and plants on both sides   When I finish walking I realize I have forgotten something   I grab someone I know and turn back to get it  People look at and begin to tell me something when.   II.    A song I have never heard before  Someone I have never talked to singing it   III.  I am with someone I do not trust    Phone Rings   I answer   woman's Voice   She obviously has mistaken me for someone else  I listen anyways  Shocked I hang up   And run to my companion  I yell and shout things I have kept inside of me  But no matter how much I yell I have this    tingly    feeling that means   I'm scared.   III. I was walking  with the same person   But I   doubt anything had happened  A helicopter flew by and I mentioned how low it was  I saw it further away landing   I ran   I container was holding children   Everyone Gasped   The container opened   Everyone Spoke of the child inside   Everyone smiled and clapped as the children moved  The middle child turned around and cried out     I can't see    Everyone gasped   The couple next to me started crying  that was their children   They were my family   I knew them  They knew me  We told them to come to my house  The oldest was fine  The younger boy and girl were blind  They tried doing things but It couldn't work  They were scared and humiliated      IV.  I Was in a camp where everyone acted as if they were from a different era  I was happy I acted different  There was one boy that led me  He worked the garden  I threw seeds into the field  The family praised him  Then a heavy downpour started  It flew into the house  We were all struggling  I threw open the remote control and stopped the rain from coming in  we ran to the boy He was alright  Someone came to pick me up  We explained it to him  The boy acted normal  But there was still a mysterious haze around him That I wanted to know what it was  We all confided secrets  and weaknesses  It lasted all day.'   That was only a small part of it
