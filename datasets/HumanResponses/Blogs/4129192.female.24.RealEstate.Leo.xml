      Finally, our team has finally decided on a chili theme. "Viva las Chili"....We have so many people on our team...roughly 28 or so. All of us have to participate in order to win. So....we are all dressing up as something! We got a Elvis, Celine Dion, Vegas PIMP & the hookers, Marilyn Monroe, Tina Turner, Wayne Newton, Showgirls ( that are really men) cocktail waitresses, cab driver, dealers, bride and groom, Siegfried and Roy and a person dressed up as Tiger that bites Roy....or is Siegfried? Hmm..I dunno. As for me, I am a tourist ( A GROUP OF ASIAN TOURISTS)  We found this really hysterical tourist costume at Party City. Its pretty funny!  Luckily, Halloween is just around the corner. Things are coming together nicely...we just have to find props to decorate our booth ( we have a poker table, roulette table, slot machine) and to make up a cheer of some sort. We're thinking about having Elvis, Wayne, Marilyn, Tina Turner, Celine sing a little clip of music each and then have the show"girls" come out with a dance. But then again....its a group effort...so the rest of us have to come up with something to add.  As you can see we are going all out for this thing! There is a possibly of winning! Wish us luck!

      Seriously....I have had my car posted for sale for a whole week and I got no calls- UNTIL TODAY!!  I've actually had offers from close family and friends but I just couldn't do that close of a transaction. I just don't want it to come back to me and haunt me...My poor little car....I felt like it seems sad lately....as if it is thinking " Nobody wants me!, Somebody buy me!!" I have someone coming to look at it this week. Hopefully I get more calls on it soon! I wanna sell it so bad....my new Volvo is waiting for me at the dealer. I can feel it calling my name! I have been waiting for months for this car. Just wanted to spread the joy to you all! That someone finally called! Yahooey!!!!!

      Oh my gawd! I can't stand this one particular dude that I work with. (He shall remain nameless.) Of course-I am paying attention to my own "ish" going on. But seriously, I don't know if can handle much more of him! When he is out of the office or leaves early one day - I am totally screwed....I get the sh*t -end of the stick. I have to deal with his brokers yelling at me. He sits right next to me unfortunately. His smell, his voice, his whole aura bothers me that much! I am serious! I cannot stand people that get ahead by cheating, lying, slacking off, come in late for work, surf the net and then go home early. And he does ALL OF THE ABOVE! I think he is the only person I know that is that sleezy. I use to be his assistant for 5 loooong months...finally I really had it. I am now working with a new account manager but if he is out....I have to cover his smelly desk. Ewe....Hate boys....not all boys....just him. That is my bitching and moaning for the day. Good night all!

      I have been working at my mortgage company for a little over a year now. I can honestly say that I love my job, I love my company- they treat us so well here. I also like the people I have met since I have started (for the most part anyway) There would be no possible way of getting fired here unless you do something completely STUPID or illegal. Well, I am not exactly sure what the heck happened but my friend Elaine got the axe today. Don't know why and when and all the other info....but it really sucks. Another girl that I have worked with before also got the axe today.....It just seems like people are getting the boot lately. I am so scared! It could be me tomorrow!!! Let me tell you the truth- I have been called to H.R. 4 times since I started here. That's alot in one year!! I have never be spoken to by H.R. before in my entire life! It's all because guys around here try to push me around and I am just the type of person to tell them off or come off with a smartass attitude. I know that is wrong and I should never do that but these guys shouldn't have talked to me the way they did in the first place. I know- I know, its childish but I don't care! I cannot stand a few guys that I work with. If I have a problem- I confront the issue head-on  but they don't do that...they make it a point to "throw me under the bus" and take me to H.R. Damn Bunch of woosies! I think working with them makes me really hate my job.....I love my job but I hate it...does that make sense? I use to work for the State of Nevada. A lot of things are going to change soon. I am moving on to work on another STATE...FLORIDA! Ugh! I hate this state! These people that I deal with are so mean! Maybe they sense that I am a b*tch over the phone. Who knows. Who cares.

      Worked Sucked today! What else is new! Can't wait to come in tomorrow and have more sh*t hit the fan! H.R. here I come.  Nelson is out of town ( In Vegas) until Friday for Work.  I can't imagine if he moves there for school and work. Its already hard enough as it is and he has only been gone for 2 days!   P.s. Brokers' voices still annoy me!

      I admit it! I am guilty! I am a reality show hoochie mama! When a new reality show comes out- if it looks like something I would like - I will check it out. If the first episode turns out good, I will tune into the next episode. I don't care what you all say- YOU ARE ALL GUILTY! I KNOW YOU HAVE TUNED INTO AT LEAST ONE! Have you ever thought about how many reality shows are out there? Its everywhere and it is so damn annoying! Some of these shows are so lame! What are these TV stations thinking? I don't know how they ever made it on the air! Off the top of my head- because I am curious myself at how many I can remember.....Here is what I got: Real World, Road Rules, The Bachelor(ette), The Apprentice, For Love or Money, Newlyweds, Blow Out, Queer Eye, Blow out, Last comic standing, Next Action Star, The Assistant, Casino, Temptation Island, Extreme Makeover, Ashley Simpson Show, American Idol 1,2,3,4. Survivor 1,2,3,4. Big Brother 5???? (5???What the hell is that all about?) I am so sure there are more out there but I am not going to go there. Feel free to add more to my list if you think of some. The whole point to this is....THERE IS TOO MANY! And most of them are lame as hell!  My new indulgence- Growing up Gotti.  I enjoyed watching a day in the  life of a Mob. But it's still lame.

      Virgin-blogger here! I am seriously clueless as to how to work this blogging system- but I guess I will give it a try and see what happens.Today was a semi-good day! My team ( co-workers) bought me a Pink Paul Frank Beach Cruiser bike for my birthday. My co-worker finally brought it in to me today. It has a bell, a basket and I can't wait to go home to ride around in it. I rode around the office today- did not turn out well when the Owner of our company and HR caught me ringing my bell and buzzin around instead of working! I made them laugh though! That's all that counts. I haven't rode a bike in so long! I hope I don't crash!  Work is another story....Do you ever have one of those days when you talk to someone on the phone- their voice just irritates the crap outta you? Today is one of them days! Here in our office we deal with mortgage brokers all day long...sometimes I wonder if my voice is as annoying as theirs! Probably. I don't doubt that one bit! But damn- their voice! By the time I get home after work I am not in the mood to talk to anyone, I am cranky, I am moody....I am ALL OF THE ABOVE!! My poor Nelson- he is the one who gets to deal with me at the end of the day. Everyone, give Nelson props! He is a quite the trooper I tell ya! The cool thing about Nelson is that he never bitches or complains...he just listens and takes it all in. ( But then again- he probably isn't even listening.)  Football season is coming. He already worned me....no talking until the game is over! So Sunday and Mondays are major days to have no contact with him. Especially if the team that he is rooting for LOSES...he will be moooody!! So I won't talk to him for a whole week. Fine with me.
