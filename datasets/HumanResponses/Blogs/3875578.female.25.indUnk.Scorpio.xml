      My sister worked as a cashier at a grocery store while in college.  One day a local bum came in and bought a six-pack of beer with money he'd collected from begging outside the store.  Later he came in to buy a 40 and went through my sister's line.  He ended up being a dollar short (which means he hadn't collected very much since his last purchase since 40s hardly cost a thing).  He was digging through his pockets for money and my sister, being the very empathetic person she is, said "Don't worry, I got it," and pitched in a dollar of her own. Later customers started complaining about the drunk bum outside.  The cops were called and to make a long story short, the bum was arrested for public intoxication and taken away.  I always like to give my sister crap about how she got the bum arrested.

      Isn't funny how pet's names evolve into other names.  Take for instance a cat our family had as a child.  He was a beautiful Maine Coon.  He was a purebred and he had a twist pattern on him so we named him Oliver Twist and called him Oliver. Well after we'd had him a few months and we'd just returned from vacation to find out that he had relieved himself all over my parent's bed several times.  We found this unusual since this is where he slept most of the time and cats won't normally do their business in the area where they sleep unless something is wrong.  Turns out he had a bladder infection and so his new name was Mr. Potty.  Mr. Potty soon turned into Peter Potty and then to my all-time favorite Peter Pottinski.  Funny!  Here are some other transformations: Tawney--Teeny Weeny, Winky, Winkerbell Tichiba-Tichi, Chi-Chi, Chi-Chi Bee, Beenie, Beenie Baby, Beanery         Also Special Chi, Cutie Chi, Lover Chi, Beauty Chi         and Grrrfrenn (Girlfriend pronounced nasally) Shadow--DoDo, Dodi, He's my Do! Jade--JJ, Jay, Jaybird, Jaybear It's funny because no matter what you say they always know you're talking to them!

      I was just thinking today of the day I got my tonsils out.  It was my 5th birthday and I remember everything so vividly.  My last supper was a hamburger with fries.  I was wearing my oh-so-cool purple cords with the pink stripe down the side and my shirt was purple, yellow, and pink stripes.  I brought my only Barbie I owned along, a Skipper actually, and she was wearing her ski outfit.  My brother was there too and he was always causing so much trouble with the nurses.  I remember watching Scarecrow and Mrs. King on TV and how the nurses weren't nice after our parents left.  I remember being gassed and waking up and everything. Yet I can't remember where I put my keys half the time.  Isn't it weird what your mind chooses to remember?
