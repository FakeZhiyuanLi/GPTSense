      Finished my third exam paper yesterday which was VLSI.......it was basically the same as the previous 2 papers loh......I know how to do most of the questions...only that I got a few questions that I dun know how to answer so just anyhow answer lah.....All my 3 papers can pass one lah....just a matter of how much marks I can get only......now still left one more exam paper which is the Business Law but that's basically a 50 MCQ questions paper so now I am more relaxed liao....  I went to eat Dim Sum with Eng Chiaw and Yee Chien after our exam yesterday.....I think it has been a long time since I ate tim sum liao.....I haven't eaten it since.....hmm....too long until I can't remember!! hee....And after our lunch we went to watch the movie "The Day After Tomorrow"...The cinema was almost full and the movie was around 2 hours plus.......It was quite a good movie and it really gives increased awareness of the global warming that is happening and what they depict in the movie is actually true cos I have watched a documentary about the change in the sea currents and that would bring about a drop in temperature as shown in the movie.....althought not as fast as the movie.....but then its a movie what so it has to be fast and exciting if not nobody wants to watch it.......

      I will be having my 2nd exam in two days time.......revision has been on schedule and I basically know how to do most of the questions for my subjects liao so now it is basically revising, practising and memorising stuff that I need to know for the exams.......This would probably be the last exams that I would be taking unless I am gonna further my studies somemore which is of very little probababilty at least for the near future......  On another note, yesterday was the FA Cup Final between Manchester United and Millwill and Man United won 3-0!!!! Yeah...."Glory Glory Man United....Glory Glory Man United......" hee.....think I got a bit too carried away....ha ha....well....I guess that's only a consolation price for being knocked out of the champions league and not getting the premiership title....but something is better than nothing rite??? hee...  By the way, I have just implemented a new comments thingy on my blog.....if you have any comments on my posts, just click comments below my post and write whatever you think okie????well... got to get back to study liao.....more blogging when I am free.....
