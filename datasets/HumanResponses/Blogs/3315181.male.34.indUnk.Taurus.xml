      Tuesday I believed my world was coming to an end. About an hour after my post that day things turned upside down.  My son, River, the one I wrote about, was in our living room with my mom. They were sitting on the couch. I was in my office and I heard this terrible cry come from him. It wasn't like anything I have heard from him before. My mom yelled out his name and I jumped up to run in there. My first sight of him was frightening. He was having a seizure. He never has had one. No one in our family has ever had one. I had only seen someone have one once in my life. He was not responding and was stiff. He look so distant. I began calling his name. I could see his mouth biting down on his tongue. I pried his teeth apart and put my finger between them. I know this is the wrong thing to do but in my mind I thought if I could just take some of the pain away that he was involuntarily inflicting on himself.  His lips began to turn blue and his breathing became shallow. I thought I was going to have to start CPR soon. He slowly began to close his eyes. My mom called 9-1-1. The paramedics were here so fast. They came in and began hooking all this stuff up to him. He had stop seizing but his eyes were closed and he wasn't responding to anyone.   The paramedics put him on the stretcher and we headed out the door. He began to come around and start crying. I know he must have been confused and scared by all of the people and equipment. We rushed off to the hospital.   They gave River a CT scan of his head. There wasn't any bleeding or fractures. He hated this exam.   River finally returned to his normal self. The first time he laughed I felt this weight lifted off of my chest.  He had fallen off the couch earlier in the day and hit his head on the coffee table. The doctor suspected that he had a concussion that led to the seizure. However, we are going to have more tests on him.   Since then it has been like nothing happened. He is playing and laughing just as before. I cant seem to stop worrying about him. I know it is out of my hands but I am having trouble accepting it.  I wanted to be GOD and take that moment away from him. But as River told me, "you're not God!"

      My oldest son turned three in April. I love to see the world through his eyes. Everyday he says things that blow me away. His words cut through it all and simply state what he thinks or how he feels.  My kids call me papa. They have never called me dad or daddy. I am papa. Sometimes when I reading a story to my boys and there is the word 'dad', I substitute papa instead.   Last night I was playing a video I had made and my oldest walked up and watched with me. The narration mentioned God and then Jesus shortly thereafter. My son repeated 'God' and then 'Jesus' like the video did. I looked at him and asked him what he said. He repeated the words God and Jesus and smiled. I said to him, God is the Papa of Jesus. He quickly replied to me, "You're not God!"

      It has been over a month since I last wrote. I thought I would have something profound to say by now, but I don't. I'm not sure if I ever do.  What is the point of this anyway? For years I would write almost daily in journal books. Then I had kids. Well, I didn't have them, my wife did. But even when I was writing I would often stop and think, 'what is the point anyway? Who is going to read this and more importantly, who is going to care?' On a basic level, this is very selfish, narcissistic and silly. "Dear Diary...I just love my new shoes...."  But for me it is also therapy. My thoughts usually stick together like glue. I have to pick them apart one at a time like you do when you play pick-up-sticks. I gently lift one off of the other. So, I guess this writing helps me sort it out. I'm not crazy. At least, I've never been certified as such.  So how's that for a start into my world?
