       200m peanut dash  =Ok well if you have num lock on you can use both , num lock   arrows as well as the   ones below Home, End, Insert etc.   Make sure you are pressing the right and left arrow _together_ when your getting your energy up. Also, you don't have to press them faster and faster...just make sure you have a _consistant_ rythm.   To make a 2x Back/Front flip, when you're running under the shadow, just keep pressing the right arrow then the left arrow. It doesn't have to be fast, just be like right....left...right.. etc. And right when you see a log press the up arrow, then the right/left arrow. It takes a couple of tries of getting use to, but it does work!   When you see the peanut coming down, always jump, even if it is a straight jump, you get bonus points for catching it in mid-air!     Advert Attack =in advert attack, if you click on the pop ups, not the blue part, another pop up appear, so don't click on the pop ups.  1. Dont let the first level get to you: You will start to think- Gee, this is EASY!! Dont let it get to you, this game can get hard.   2. Popups are NOT annoying (at least not very): If the popups arent in the space where the GO! thingies apper, dont get rid of them!! Actually, you dont have to get rid of any popups, unless they are in the way, because most of them appear on the edge of the screen.   3. Turn off the sound: The BOING sound that the popups make is really annoying, and distracting, so turn off the speakers...   4. Giant popus aren't that bad: Once you get to the 3rd or 4th level, the popups are HUGE! If you can see the X, click it, if not, move it to the bottom of the screen.   5. Popups are weird: When you move popups, remember, they don't move like regular computer windows. You click and hold to pick it up, and once you've got it where you want it, you let go and click once more, this will detach the popup from the little pointer thingy.   6. Forget about the race: The game isn't called "The race of the spaceship thingys, with popups", its called Advert Attack, as in ADVERTISEMENT attack. So dont worry if youre winning or watch the race, concentrate on clicking the yellow thingies that say GO! and getting rid of/moving popups.    Bumper Cars  =I'm usually the blue, but i basicly just sit there and let everyone kill each other and when there's one car left it's usually really damaged so then i just hit it. This got me up to like level 5 then i had to start working : ) hope this helps!!!!   never ever ever use the shield! even if it helps you protect yourself dont! you cant earn points wen you hit!!!!   do u realize that the items are in diffrint colours thats the power level here is it from lowest level to highest level: blue,red,white,yellow,glowing yellow. always pick blue cause its much more easier to control   A cars' most vulnerable place is it's side. You can earn a lot of points for that. Also, try not to get the gasoline because it can just make your driving worse and you can drive to the wrong side (unless you can handle that easily). When you see a bomb, try to get any car around it. This will only work if you are alone with another car. Do not get so close to the bomb, it can ruin your chances of going to another level.   If you drive your car backwards it takes less damage to the engine when you hit people.   Always try to bash the cars into a corner. Every time they hit the wall they lose 5 points so if you hit them and they hit the 2 walls in the corner you get the job done 3 times as fast!!!   when i play bumper cars i try and hit any passing cars then pess the (Keys are the blue car)up key right side key and the lower key so i go in a big circle the cars follow you but most of the time they cant hit you because they are following you so it back fires you get them...   BE AGGRESSIVE IN THIS GAME!!! You only get points for hitting the other cars, so if you want lots of points, DON'T WAIT!!! I have found that waiting for the cars to start approaching you before you go up to hit them doesn't get you as many points and can get you into some nasty scrapes (example: your side gets bashed so you can't go strait)   the yellow car is the most aggresive car, red, always smashes itself against the back wall, if you start to go at it, and kills itself. i am always the blue car, the green car is pretty easy, the yellow car is harder and the red car is just nuttin, hope it helps! questions? i know all the cheats and secret links!!    I am usually the blue car, and what i will do is go out in the middle of the screen and press the up and one of the side buttons. It will spin u in circles and keep doin that over and over. The cars will run into u and u wont get much damage. Ive gotten to like level 10 with this.    castle of eliv thade  =If you are low on clues, type rehaxtint, and you will get one extra clue.          Special thanks Michig for the following tip!  I was just playing Castle of Elive Thade and I accidently found another secret passage. There is a hidden square to the right of the first cracked square after the library if you are coming from the kitchen. If you aren't sure which square I mean you can always check by putting your cursor on it because your cursor will change into whatever you see when you put your cursor on a regular square. For example, my cursor goes from an arrow when I cannot click on anything, to a hand when there is a link or anything else I can click on. When my cursor goes over that spot it turns into a hand. From there you can go into the last room but of course you still have to have gone to all the other rooms first. Hope this makes sense.          Special thanks _kittycats_ for the following tip!  in the castle of eliv thade, there's another secret passage on top of the crypt. Just move your mouse over the black space on top, the pointer will change into a hand.          Special thanks howlstothestars for the following tip!  I just wanted to add that the second tip for the Castle of Eliv Thade does hold one consequence. Sometimes Neopets throws in words that are Neopets "lingo," which should be watched out for. For example, a word like "Neopian" will often pop up. Just thought I'd share that bit of info.          Special thanks chocolateandberries for the following tip!  I found something out just now when i was only trying 2 joke around: after u go up one block then go one to the left, bring your mouse to 'bedroom' and it says 'to move here it requires a 6 letter word.' i tried it, and it totally worked!!!!! it's a secret passage!!!!!          Special thanks littlefairy02 for the following tip!  Start a game in hard mode. Once it has loaded, open this link in another window: http://www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagott.html.   When you've done that, click on the farthest square you can (but not if its a cracked one, too risky), then type the anagram into the anagram solver and you'll get your answer. Don't tick the box which says "Include single-character words (a and I)" and don't limit each solution. If you want to, try to limit to six minimum. And when the results of possible words is displayed, search for the single word one, not the phrases. =)    cheat  =    Special thanks eventgirl53 for the following tip!  If you get caught cheating, and are handed a 25 card pile. Do NOT get rid of your cards as fast as you can.   a) Get rid of the cards that you only have 1 of, because if you have 3 twos and 4 fives, then keep them till last. Because then you can tell if someones cheating much easier. It does work.   b) Another reason for keeping all the big groups of cards is because its easier to jump ahead at the end of the game rather than the start.   On both of these tips I've earnt a minimum of 110 points because on each turn I caught at least one person. Try it!          Special thanks shoyrugal888 for the following tip!  Remember that there are only 4 cards of each type in the deck.If someone say Capara put down 4 Kings,when you have 1 King in your hand,then she is cheating.             Special thanks tigger_the_tiger_01 for the following tip!  1) Only cheat when you have to and only throw away one to two cards.  2)accuse everyone of cheating every time if the pile is under 7 cards.  3)When someone plays there last card ACCUSE THEM. if they are not cheatoing you will lose, if they are you will win money and that round.  4)NEVER GIVE UP...you can never win if you just quit.  5)HAVE FUN!!!!!          Special thanks pitch_black_magic for the following tip!  In the Game cheat when another player has 0 cards left in his/her deck and has just put one down, be sure to accuse them of cheating because you will always be right.          Special thanks ??? for the following tip!  on cheat, they KNOW when you cheat, if you must cheat, call the guy before you a cheater. if you are right you get to pick any card, if you are wrong, at least you get to get rid of some extra cards. you might occasionally get away with cheating in the first few rounds but before long i guarentee that they will catch you every time          Special thanks Firefly_fizz16 for the following tip!  When you're getting rid of your cards try not to get rid of a card (or cards) and then the next card right after that (ex: 2s then 3s then 4s) it will increase your chance of having to cheat. Try and keep a nice range of cards in your hand when you have a lot of cards because it will decrease your chance of having to cheat.          Special thanks sushifaerie13 for the following tips!  On Cheat you can figure out what cards you'll need when its your turn.  Example: The player before you plays a 10. Your range for your next cards will be from 9-11. If someone accuses them of cheating (regardless if they're right or wrong) then you'll get a chance to choose any card.          Special thanks Candydancer1316 for the following tips!  Cheat is like the much none game BS. There is a very simple concept,to lose all of your cards before the other players. My advice is to take a deck of cards and play BS until you think you are really good. Than you can whiz through cheat like there is no tomorrow! But there is a downside to this. It's harder to tell who is cheating because in real life someone can burst out laughing and everyone knows they're cheating.But in cheat they are just pictures so you can't tell.          Special thanks earth_faeire for the following tips!        1) Only ever cheat when you have to.         2) Only ever accuse someone of cheating if you’re 100% sure they’ve cheated.         3) Don’t give up! Even if you have 25 cards - carry on.         4) If you cheat, only play 2-3 cards - play 4, and you’re guaranteed to get caught!         5) If someone’s just played their last card, accuse them of cheating. If they weren’t cheating, you’ll lose anyway. But if they were - you stay in the game.     cheese roller  =Alkenore - 1,200 NP  Big Beefy - 750 NP  Brain - 1,050 NP  Brick - 1,950 NP  Bubbling Blueberry - 1,500 NP  Gooey Snot - 2,100 NP  Honey - 600 NP  Mutated - 1,350 NP  Overgrown - 2,250 NP  Peppermint - 2,400 NP  Purple Spotted - 900 NP  Quadruple Fudge - 1,800 NP  Smoked Snorkle - 300 NP  Spicy Juppie - 150 NP  Triple Mustard - 450 NP  Tyrannian Dung - 1,650 NP    always hit dive left or dive right you have a higher chance of winning. it always works for me      chomby & f/balls  =welcome to the game.lv1 is easy just take the fungus ball out and run.   cornered lv2 same as one   squares lv3 this one is a bit tricky you have to wait for the right moment to go,don't go to fast at the begining or it will be nearly impossible.   moving mushrooms lv4 the mushroom are the biggest problem they always turn right so never ever go left and go fast too but don't touch them   ambush lv5 this is easy if you look in every direction before you go to the star and back   red fungus lv6 before you go to the star wait for an opening then go   mini maze lv7 you move as fast as you can until you can get the star look for the least crowded area then go that way   too many fungus balls! lv8 fungus balls are everywhere dogde them all and head for the exit if you dier near the exit press enter and try to move to the exit   CHEAT!!!!:( lv9 1 of the stages i hate(more like 4th place ) this stage has a red fungus ball gaurding the exit so you have a 25%chance of beating it   yellow followers lv10 (5 more lvs) try to figure this one on your own (cause idn't know a solution.)   hurry up!!lv11go as fast as you can to the teleporters   TOO MUCH GAURDING!!!!!lv12 on the scale of 1 to 10 10 being the worst i'd give it a 900,000 the only way of getting the star is watching the fungus ball (the one gaurding the star)go in the one path that is next to the path leading to the star and wait for it to come out it needs to be a fast one sokill yourself until you get it 10% chance    Cliffhanger  = this is an additional cheat i invented for cliffhanger...   for instance, the answer is "an idle mind is the best way to relax"   so in the box it should look something like this:  _ _   _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _   _ _  _ _ _   _ _ _ _   _ _ _   _ _  _ _ _ _ _  all you need to do is, count the number of words in the statement (9 words), then the number of letters there are in the first three words:  an - 2 letters  idle - 4 letters  mind - 4 letters  than you look at the list above (look at 9 words) and look for sentences that have 2 letters in the first word, 4 letters in the second word and 4 letters in the third word. you should be able to find it most of the time.   *WARNING* when i said most of the time, i meant that if you count wrongly, say bye bye to neopoints!!   *ANOTHER WARNING* pls note that some other sentences may also have 2 letters in the first word, 4 letters in the second word and 4 letters in the third word, so you may wanna check the number of letters in the last word just to make sure.

Pop ups:  Flag- Half raised will increase your health meter partly, fully raised will heal you 100%  Treasure Chests-go after them, they get you 75+ worth of treasure points  Coins- Some don't give much, but they can be quite handy.  Crates- Grab them as soon as you can- unless you only have like a few squares left    The Dudes:  Cannon- slow, but still avoid them  Myncis- are okay to deal with in the lower rounds, but then they get annoying in level 2  Techo- These guys seem to have a mind of their own! They follow you most the time and are much faster than the other pirates, watch out when you get two at once!  Sword- This helps you a lot! When you're in a situation where you're cornered (with something like techos or if you have a low health meter for example), follow it around for a bit... or you can just take your chances and run through the guys.    Levels:   Round 1:  These don't really matter because you can back step without messing up a block, so just go through these as fast as you can to get the time bonus,    Round 2:  Level 1: go in a spiral around the pool in the center, try not to back step  Level 2: go around the two outer rows (go in a spiral) when you get to the bottom right of the inner part (diagonal of the water), mover left, left, up, up, and just follow the cross until you end up where you came in it, then just follow the cleared path to finish  Level 3: The Easiest!(as long as a guy or crate doesn't mess you up) here's the exact directions to not have to back step:  up(to the end of that row) left, left, down(6 times) right, down, left, left, up (3 times), left, down (3 times), left, up (6 times), right, right, up, left, (all the way to the end of the row) down (6 times) right, down, left  Level 4: is just weird... that one you have to back step, but when you do... most likely in many situations, the best way to still get spaces swabbed is by a two steps forward, one step back kinda situation, there's many things you can do here- it just gets confusing from there...  That goes for the same in the other levels, try your own techniques and see how far you can go! :)    Defenders of Neopia! = Here is what you need to know to get yourself started with completing the levels in this game! :) Now, you know where to go... Are your pets strong enough? Now, to get each trophy, you must first visit the Defenders of Neopia Headquarters and be given your task. Each level must be completed in order.      PANT DEVIL   The only way you can fight the Pant Devil is if he has challeneged you. The only way he challenges you is by stealing one of your items. If you have not yet been challeneged, I would suggest you leaving many inexpensive items in your inventory for him to steal. Also, if you play the Wheel of Excitement often, he might steal from you there.     GHOST LUPE   If you have not already found the Ghost Lupe, you have to go to the following location in the neohomes: Clickie Here! - 131 Soup Alley     CAVE CHIA   If you have not already found the Cave Chia, you have to go to page two of the Cave Paintings located in Tyrannia. Clickie Here! Be warned, you might have to refresh 20+ times before he challenges you!     MEUKA   The only way you can fight Meuka is if you were challenged. The only way to be challenged is to have your pet become sick with Sneezles and then visit the Quick Reference Page. Good Luck~!     BRAIN TREE   To be challeneged by the Brain Tree, you must first complete a quest. After you start a Brain Tree Quest the only way to get the answers required is to complete two Esophagor Quests.     COMMANDER GAROO   If you have not already been challenged by Commander Garoo, you can locate him by refreshing over at the Space Station. Now, you only have to figure how to beat him.. ;)     TEKKITU the WITCH DOCTOR   If you have not already been challenged by Tekkitu the Witch Doctor, you can locate him by refreshing over at the Tiki Tours. Good luck with beating him!     MEERCA HENCHMEN   If you have not already been challenged by the Meerca Henchmen, you can locate him by refreshing over at the Trap Door until you are challenged. Good luck!     GIANT GHOSTKERCHIEF   This challenger should already be in your list of 1 player challengers. You have to beat him to complete the 9th level of DoN. Be wary! He is the toughest challenger yet!     EVIL SLOTH CLONE   To find the Evil Sloth Cones, you must visit Neopia's Moon. Make note, when you battle the clone, it will say that you have not fought this challenger. Each battle is with a different clone!     SNOW BEAST   To find the Snow Beast, refresh the front of the Advent Calendar until you find him. This can take a very long time though; so be warned. It has reportedly taken some people over 1 days time to find him with continous refreshing.       Destruct-O-Match  =        Special thanks DakotaGirl1 for the following tip!  I found in this game if on your first level you clear all, they x your score by 6. It also helps to start at the top and work down.          Special thanks fire_13_ for the following tips!  A good thing to do is chose a colour which you thinink has the most bricks on your page. Now when you click on the bricks DONT click on any ones of the colour you chose. If all goes to plan you should end up with tons of the bricks of the colour you chose at the beginning to click on and then you get TONS of points Allso start at the top and work your way down the page that way you dont miss any bricks.          Special thanks to ??? for the following tips!  The best way of ALL to get high scores on this game is to find a way to clear all of the blocks in level one. If you can do this, then you will end this round with 650 points or more. This will insure that you will get to level four (which requies a minimum of 700 points to enter.) This is defnitely the secret to this game!!! Good luck!          Special thanks thewanderingmystery for the following tips!  Remember, in Destruct-O-Match(DOM), The NUMBER OF POINTS YOU MAKE IS CUT IN HALF WHEN YOU SEND YOUR SCORE! So, try to get at least 1000 points. That way you get 500 neopoints or more!   To get a high score, before you double click on some bricks to break them, look at the bricks surrounding it, and image where the bricks will end up placed and if they'll match well or not. Doing this will lower the amount of clicks you make, therefore make your score higher once you reach the next level(Depending on your score and how many clicks you mad last level, Neopets will sometimes add more points to your score in the next level to help you.)   BE CAREFUL! The higher the level, the more different coloured bricks there are, and the harder it is to match the colours!   So, remember:    -Imagine where the bricks will fall BEFORE you click  -Try to complete the level in the FEWEST clicks possible  -The Higher The Level, The More Coloured Bricks there are   Good Luck and HAVE FUN!          Special thanks linzborg for the following tips!  try starting from the top and working down, this way the blocks dont shift as much and u get more points. also, pick one coler that there is a particurly a lot of, and dont "destruct" those. leave them to the end then do them in as few clicks as possible, u get more points that way.          Special thanks ????? for the following tips!  I have found when playing this game it's best to choose one color (that shows up the most) on the first level.MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT CLICK ON ANY MATCHES OF THAT COLOR! If you just do the other colors until there's no moves left that don't use your special color you should have a big amount of the same color in one spot.   I also find it GREAT to click on the next level button a lot when your finished with one level because it sometimes gets you extra points!     Dice-A-Roo =  This does work...  Many people are stating that neopets has disabled it, but it still works for me & other people... It is really dependant on the settings on your computer. This will work for some people, and won't work for others...         This is a great game worth playing daily! It is a super easy game that costs about 400 NPs total a day. (If you play the game the way I am going to describe below...)         Well, first trick is to have your keyboard set at a slow rate. (You can do this by going to your control panel.) Make sure it repeats about 1-2 times every second. This will help you get through the game pretty fast ;) Also, make sure it starts repeating right away. The trick is finding the perfect repeat rate. It can be hard at first. If you repeat too fast, then it it won't work. If you repeat too slow, then you will go to the next page quite often. Take your time in finding the perfect repeat rate for your keyboard.         After you click the "Let's Play! (Cost 5 NP)" button, you will be taken to a screen that had the 5 colored dice & another button that stats "Play Dice-A-Roo"         Immediately after you click that button, hold down your enter key. Keep holding it down for about 3-5 minutes. After that time, let the page process the next page. If your pet has not gotten bored of playing Dice-A-Roo yet, click the back button. Repeat the step of holding down the enter key for a bit longer.         When your pet has become bored, go check your inventory to see if you won any cool prizes! One time I won 3 faeries & 1 negg (plus a lot of other food). I usually average about 10-20 food items that can be sold for on average 50-200 NPs each. Selling at least 5 of these items gernally earns back the NPs you spent playing the game until your pet was bored.         Also, check the Neopian Lottery to see if you won any Lottery Tickets! If I have had a good day, I can win 3-7 tickets! I've never won the lottery, but you can't go wrong with pretty much free tickets. ;)         Now, if you know your pets stats, check them out. Sometimes the game will raise the level a pet. That is always great too ;)         Please do not get upset if this tip does not work for you. A lot of things can affect how this tip works: from your internet connection speed to a few settings on your computers. This till will NOT work for everyone.   EXAMPLE      Here is what I recevied 6/24:        Lottery Tickets: 2 ticket(s)        Level: 0 level(s)        Items: 9 total (0 negg)     Dubloon Disaster  =        Special thanks Shybabee123 for the following tip!  This is a very simple game if you know how to play.   When you begin go forward without getting the Dubloon. Doing this makes the boat go faster.   Then go get the Dubloon, then another. Take the longest route everytime avoiding the Heat Activated Bombs.   Every two Dubloons, get in the middle of the bombs and wait for them to approach you. When they get closer you move forward making them go an extra distance in which they get closer, and closer to each making themselves explode on contact.   Do this every two and see how for you get. Remember that you get double the Neopoints in this game.          Special thanks followgod for the following tip!  For Dubloon disaster, if the activated bombs are near the dubloon then go toward the oppistite direction and they will follow you. Then charge towards the dubloon, for you are faster then the bombs.     Evil Fuzzle  =       Special thanks ??? for the following tip!  for the game evil fuzzles, if you have realtively good aim, don't collect the bonus until you have hit at least ten. you make twice the points because istead of it multiplying by 2 it multiplies by three. second, if you follow the first tip, you should always have enough for guns. level 6 guns do work on level 6 fuzzles. don't hit mines except for ones coming at you, only the ones coming at you hurt you, and the other ones don't add points. as you reach the station, if you have a big bonus get it now. start collecting little bonuses, like 2x2. If you can kill all the fuzzles, you won't need to buy a repair droid or shields. Don't buy shields or repair droids, just buy regular healing things, and only if your hull is under 45.          Special thanks superachel for the following tip!  For the game evil fuzzles from beyond the stars it is best to collect your bonus points more frequently as you approach the station.          Special thanks jemjabella for the following tip!        1) Shoot as many in a row as possible.         2) Only upgrade your gun to level 4. Even on 6, you’ll still have to shoot the black ones twice. At least this way, you save money.         3) Buy the complete set of droids - then, when you are damaged - you get repaired quickly.         4) If you know you won’t have time to shoot a particular fuzzle, collect the bonus. You’ll still get loads of points!         5) Only get the bombs that are coming directly towards you. The rest won't touch you - and there’s a risk of missing, and losing your bonus.    Extreme Herder  =        Special thanks Kagabr1 for the following tip!  On the early levels of the game, there are white bars on the sides of the walls. You can go throught these and they take you to the other side of the field. They can be really helful when you're in a tight spot and need to get away fast.          Special thanks cuteasianchick for the following tip!  1. Try to collect as many fire orbs because you get faster for a certain amount of time.   2. Collect snowflakes. They will temporarily freeze Balthazar.   3. Go for the Bonus pets first.. cuz they give u a bonus :P   4. Balthazar is never right next to the pen. so u can safely be next to him. but watch out for the corners.   that's it :P          Special thanks qwertybear for the following tip!  After each level, and before the beginning of the next level, get to the upper left-hand side of the screen (where balthezaar enters each level) the pet-pets will stay away from that area and will therefore be harder for balthazaar to get.          Special thanks Kris_021 for the following tip!  For the game, Extreme Herder, get the snowflakes ASAP, as they freeze the wolf guy right where he is which gives you more time.          Special thanks princess_beth_ny for the following tip!  If you need to take a short break, get all the petpets in the pen EXCEPT ONE. As soon as you pick up that last petpet, Balthazar will return to the corner and stay there as ong as you keep holding the petpet.

Special thanks dark_harpie for the following tip!  The best players are Meekins, Floud, and Dark Faerie. Try to close yourself on the down/top half of the game screen. Also TRY to close all gaps that separate you from the down/top half and the bottom half. Just scroll around until your opponent hits the wall. Dont play on easy mode at all. Medium is fine, but hard is the best, it give you more points. Your score is doubled into neopoints here so you can make alot of money!!          Special thanks skyflyer2007 for the following tip!  Always choose the floud. It is not too slow and not too fast. Also, it has good reaction time to when you press the key on the keyboard.   The first thing you should do is get a line all the way across. That way, your opponent is trapped on the other side. After that, try not to have too many spaces between your lines. hug the corners very tightly to prevent spaces. Good Luck!!!     Frumball  =        Special thanks Jlmtgm for the following tip!  In Frumball, if you type Frumball as the countdown starts, you get an extra life. Has worked for me everytime I've done it     Gormball  =       Special thanks Gothic_Chick77 for the following tip!  well i think in a game of Gormball you need luck & maybe a bit of skill. The best character to play with is 'Thyassa the Chia' He is ranked #1 in the world, And this might be true i think 70% of the time you might win. plus you will never get knocked out on the first go.  Secret: Pick a character then start playing. when its your go to enter how long you want to hold the ball. enter 1 second and hit throw. When the new screen comes up, hit the back button and enter in 5 seconds. do this everytime on your turns. What this does is the computer thinks your opponents are holding the ball for 5 seconds and you only hold it for 1. may help you win. i'm not that certain but hey give it ago.     Grundos Gym  =        Special thanks 321fire_faerie for the following tip!  What you have to do is move your mouse in circles , through the ball and the time spot, going over the ball everytime around. It Always Works for me!          Special thanks snitzerr for the following tip!  Work your way up to level 5 trainer. When you are at level 5, do all the exercises extcept one. It doesn't matter which one though. Then go away and come back in 24 hours. The level 5 will start over and you can get all the paychecks (each 100np) for the exercises again!    Hannah and the Pirate Caves  =        Special thanks evilishies for the following tip!  Before you read any further, do all six of the tutorials if you haven't already done so. Done that? Good! This is what happens when you beat the game:   Game Completed!   Congratulations for completing all 20 levels   You collected every piece of treasure... But you didn't find any of the secret hidden gems!   There is a secret hidden gem in every level. Some are behind secret passageways, and some are in hard-to-reach places. If you want to get even higher scores, start from the beginning and try to find them all!   You may have already noticed some of these gems. Each of them are worth 5,000 points. Don't know how to get them? No fear! Most of them are hidden in the rock background. When you enter it, a message scrolls through your screen saying: 'Secret Passageway!' I won't walk you through the tutorials because they're pretty self-explanitory.   Walkthrough 1: After jumping over all the pits, turn around and jump in the last pit. There will be a 'loose' rock that you can push to the left. After it falls and disentregrates the bridge, hop to the left of it. Collect your first gem and head back out.   Walkthrough 2: Close to the door, where the last 4 lumps of treasure are, jump off the platform to the right to enter the passageway. This might take a couple tries.   Walkthrough 3: This one is my favorite because Neopets misleads you. When the warning about the falling boulders comes up, pay it no attention. After you set off the arrow, stay to the right of the falling boulders. When they're all settled, climb up them. You should get a message saying you're 'stuck'. Pay it no attention! Keep climbing up the boulders and when you reach the top, jump up the wall to reach a secret area where you will get some treasure, a gem, and be dropped off to the door.   Walkthrough 4: After you have activated the dynamite from below and made it fall, drop down and jump to a hole in the left of the wall to get your treasure.   Walkthrough 5: After you have collected everything, jump over the open door and into a hole in the wall to the left. There is a drop right under the gem that takes you to a part earlier in the level, but if you are good you can get the gem and not drop down.   Walkthrough 6: I haven't found the gem on this one, but when I do, it'll be on this page!   The walkthroughs are over! No! Wait, that's not quite accurate. This guide is your walkthrough! From now on, there will be 3 kinds of levels: Timed (when water pours in from the top of the level) Stragetic (try to figure out how to get treasure) Action (You set traps that you have to avoid.)   Level 1: Timed Jump to the left, where the spikes are, and you should hit a secret door where there's a gem and a ladder. After getting to the top og the ladder, crouch to exit the secret door. Head to the left, avoiding the Pawkeet and collecting the treasure. After getting 7 treasure boxes, go back to the right. There's a pit up and right with 3 treasure boxes. Collect those and jump up and left to get all treasures except one, which ye shall recieve after going straight right past the door.   Level 2: Stragetic Get all treasure boxes close to you, don't bother going on the platform where the door is. Next, go in the water, and where a big drop from the spikes are, press close to the left wall as you swim down and the next gem will await you. Get out, go to the surface, and swim to the right, where a platform should block off some crates. Jump the platforms, collecting treasure chests, and jump over the arrow to land still on the platform left of it. Go to the treasure chest and jump straight up to hit an arrow. This will release rocks that help you get up to the door. Next, get the arrow that you missed. It will send a rock down, so make sure you stand out of the way. It'll smash the underwater platform and give you the last chests. Break the 9 crates, come back up for air, and swim down for an extra life. Go back up as quickly as you can. Swim left, climp the rocks and ladder, and go out the door.   Level 3: Timed Immediately climb up the ladder, head right, go up the second ladder and hit the arrow and chest. There is a Pawkeet so crouch every time he comes by. Shoot the second arrow that is knocked down to release tons of rocks and a treasure chest. Push the last rock to break the last spikes and jump into the left wall for a secret area. Don't waste time, just grab the gem. Go to where you started and go in the pit on the right for treasure. Run up the ladder again and this time, crawl down the incline which should mostly be filled with water. This should save you time. When you get to the bottom, hit the arrow and go back to the air pocket because 4 rocks come down. When they're done, go to the top and collect the last 3 chests. Drop down to find yourself right next to the door.          Special thanks starcaw for the following tip!  If you want many points, try to smash all things you can see, if you not are on a level when water pouring in. Always play the tuoritals and earn more NP! If you want to find the gems easily shall you look in the walls. The secret areas is leading to the gem. If it is like small holes in the wall is the secret area! Try to find out how to get to it.   Gems: Tuorital 1 - In the place where you shall jump to different "cliffs", fall dow on the last. "Oh you fall! Climb down the ladder and try again", or something a sign will say when you move a bit. Don't climb down yet - jump over the free boulder and move it until it falls down behind the ladder. jump down on the boulder, and on one side it is a hole. jump down in it and get to the gem. jump up and complete the tuorital!   Gems: Tuorital 2 - Before you enter the exit; jump up on a wooden platform and jump into the wall.   Gems: Tuorital 3 - When the boulders will fall in chain reactions when you hit the arrow, DON'T RUN. Stay where you are. The sign says you're stuck, but keep climbing up for the boulders and find the secret area!          Special thanks abelboon & gerger_8_version2 for the following tip!  there are always some secret areas in some levels, like level2, 3, 5, and 7. some levels will have those green things and sometimes there are dots on these green things from a walll leading to a gem. when you go into the secret area, your air is also restored. sometimes, the ones with the blue things will be harder to find. but so far, we've found that level2, and 5. that is harder to find the secret area. sometimes, you have to break crates to go in and be careful of the spikes. there may be more secret areas but these are the only ones we found!          Special thanks jollybeeke for the following tip!  In each world you have a gem you need the find that in a secret area.The secret area's are sometimes hard to find but it's always possible.The gems are each 5000p in the game.And another tip you can also find them in tutorial worlds. Well this can help you de get some more points.          Special thanks ??? for the following tip!  While playing this game, look for walls with holes.  They lead you to gems and restore your air!          Special thanks dmncdvl03 for the following tip!  I have discovered a way to find the so called ‘secret’ gems. Most levels should have the secret areas and gems. To identify the secret area path look closely at the landscape, or ‘terrain’ for black dots. This indicates the path of the secret gem area. Follow the end of it, and try to get into it. Voila, it should work, and you should have found the gem. I haven’t found them all yet, as I can only get to level 11 or so.          Special thanks secret_neopian_947 for the following tip!  On the rock walls where you walk on, there is sometimes these little black dots on parts of it that are easy to miss. Those are secret areas that lead to gems. Gems give you extra points. Sometimes you need to clear out a set of crates to find it. When you clear out that set, the words "Secret Area!" will show. When you find the passage underwater, you don't need to worry about swimming, because water can't get in!          Special thanks ???? for the following tip!  When underwater, press space bar and hold and you will bolt toward the surface of the water. Good for emergencies; for instance you have barely any breath left, bolt up and make it to air fast enough. You can't jump very hich out of the water, though :( .          Special thanks hermie_hermitcrab for the following tip!  When you have fallen off of something and you know that when you land something will kill you(ex:spikes,dynamite,etc.) Just push restart before you hit the bottom.You won't lose a life and all you have to do is start the level over! You keep all you points as well!:)          Special thanks Maturnareluvgut for the following tip!  i think i have found a way to make climbing up ladders faster. What i do is i start to climb and then i push the spacebar or in the game it is the "jump" button. Then i push the up arrow to return to climbing. I do this repeated until i get to my destination. :)    Hubrid's Hero Heist  =        Special thanks superdragoncheetah for the following tip!  Don't go between 2 shoyru ghosts facing each other with U in the middle. The can easily attack u with the thig they throw. This is the same for the lupes. They are more threat.          Special thanks smartone170 for the following tip!  characters from worst threat to least  werelupe- will go as fast as you. shoots bones, also behind it, so be careful  shoyru- same as werelupe, but not behind it  jubjub- will kill you from farther away  kacheek- hardly any threat  try to stay away from trouble, not even for the fruits. neggs are worth a lot, and apples and evil neggs are worth 5000.          Special thanks Elizabethpalermo155 for the following tip!  On Hubrid's Hero Heist if you have all the people dead and there are more than one item that makes you get points go for the one that is worth more. It is simple but I makes you get more points!          Special thanks ??? for the following tip!  In level ten, there are no ladders leading to the ghost things... In order to get them you have to magic yourself down to them by pressing up (or down, depending on which way you want to go...) and the space bar....   Also, in order to get 1000 NP form this game, you must earn 50000, as this game divides the score by 50.    Ice Cream Factory  =        Special thanks ???? for the following tip!  The yellow colored cone that gives you enough points to advance to the next level can come out in any level.          Special thanks hockeyislife00 for the following tip!  On either the 2nd, 3rd, or fourth level, sometimes a diffent colored (normally yellow) will pop up and you should get it because it takes you ahead a few levels and gives you more points.          Special thanks penelopemak for the following tip!  keep under one cone. if that cone shoots an ice cream, move to the next one. once that ice cream has gone, go under it again.          Special thanks soup_fearie_fairy for the following tip!  In the game Icecream Factory, I have found out a major tip! It will help you get a really high score.   Whenever the game gets done loading, and the main page for you to start playing to on, right click and click on about macromedia flash.   Then, a website appears, no big deal, right? Minus it. Now, whenever you get in a tight spot, all of the scoops are hurteling at you, and you have no where to go, fallow these simple directions:  1. Right click  2. Move you mouse where you want you chia to go.  3. Once you move your mouse where you want it to go, left click and your chia will transport there saftly without losing a life!  *TIP* You may want to practice using this tip, you may want to practice a little before you start to go for the gold! It takes a little while to get used to this, but soon you can get 3,000 neopoints a day from this game if you get 4000 + in the game!          Special thanks crazeymazey for the following tip!  - Make sure you have an eye out for the yellow scoop of ice cream! (except the levels that have yellow ice cream scoops thrown at Adee)   - Collect the scoops that make Adee smaller and avoid the ones that make him larger!   - Collect the scoops that make the game faster. They are more beneficial since it ends the round quickly!   As far as getting through the warehouse, make sure you first clear a path to get to the door! In the higher warehouse levels this will be more complicated, so before you go to collect purple boxes you need to find a way to get to the other side first. One way or another, there are ways to get to the purple boxes or the exit. You just have to strategize. You should only sacrafice a life when you are seriously stuck and there is no other solution. It's important to keep track of your Lives since they will help when the warehouse levels get tough, so while dodging the ice cream scoops be on the lookout for Lives!    Igloo Garage Sale  =        Special thanks Archangel_918 for the following tips!  1. if you set the quality on low, it goes slower and you can get more points.   2.

Level 50 Portable Cloud  Unknown  This clever weapon just looks like a harmless little green cloud, but in the Battledome it reveals its secrets!    MAGAX: Destroyer  =        Special thanks blazekinser for the following tips!  Play the game on Medium or Low quality, since the game tends to get choppy on later levels making it a lot harder to move around.  The easiest way to control Magax is to go forward for a second and then turn around for about a half-second to keep your speed down. Don't hold down the arrow key though, or it'll take you longer to slow up. It takes a little practice, but you'll get used to it.  Always attack the Chia ghosts first, they spit slime globs that are tough to avoid. Save the JubJub ghosts for last, they split up into 3 smaller ghosts which are hard to hit and harder to dodge.  Don't shoot a ghost if it's near a health orb, your shots destroy the orbs too.  Hubrid Nox will do one of three things when he shows up: set you on fire (lose a little health), freeze you (Can only go in a straight line for a few seconds), or make all the ghosts on the lever larger. Hubrid uses the freeze attack a lot, so try to get to an empty part of the level when he shows up.  Don't bother trying to shoot Hubrid, you can't hit him.  There's a bug in the game that might show up after level 8: sometimes a blip will get "stuck" on your radar, and you won't be able to go any farther even after you've gotten rid of all the ghosts. This is fairly rare, but if it does happen the only thing you can do is either let Hubrid kill you with his fire attacks, or close the window and start over.   This isn't a terribly difficult game once you get the hang of the controls. If you have the patience to play it for a while, it's worth an easy 3000 NP a day. :)    Maths Nightmare  =        Special thanks ????? for the following tips!  if you right click the game will pause yet you can still see the questions. this way you can take all the time you need to get it all right. use a calculator if your feeling espeically lazy. too bad the game has a 1000 np cap. so if you want to maximize time. shoot for 100 questions.    Meerca Chase  =        Special thanks to ???? for the following tip!  I don't know if you already know this but the higher the level you play on meerca chase the more points you get from collecting neggs          Special thanks to geniekgrl for the following tip!  for meerca chase try to stay AWAY from the walls, most computers react really fast if you touch the wall or get near it. i lose mostly because of the walls also try to go straight and not ziggy zaggy because you have a good chance of running into your own tail if you go ziggy zaggy ( that is if you have a long tail ) and dont play hard if it is too fast for you, medium is ok too...:) and dont risk going between the broken spaces in hard unless you done it before...          Special thanks to nora330 for the following tip!  I have a game tip for meerca chase. there are no secret levels. just easy, medium, and hard. clicking the top right corner or holding down the shift key doesnt do anything.          Special thanks to gemma190892 for the following tip!  1) you need a s-l-o-w computer   2)set the game on hard   3)set the graphics on high   4)open a page in the background (peferbaly a one that takes ages to load)   5)start playing meerca chase   the page running in the backround will s-l-o-w down meerca chase , meaning you get more point but its slower so you dontbump into anything          Special thanks to POKEMON_GAME_GAL for the following tip!  It helps when ya go on Medium. Take your time and it is easier to go on walls.          Special thanks to Karrie_717 for the following tip!  In Meerca Chase, try to stay in the middle as much as possible. If You need to go close to the wall or red negg, as soon as you collect the negg, quickly go in a direction where it is safe. Try playing the Hard Level, and keep playing the same level over and over to get used to it.          Special thanks to Floridagirl1821 for the following tip!  Here's a quick tip I found out that works pretty well! Hold the arrow keys down instead of tapping them when you want to change direction. That way you have better control.          Special thanks to Fizztastic22 for the following tip!  I recomend to you that on Meerca Chase, you always take the long way round. When deciding what difficulty to go at, only go on the hardest one when you are either trying to get a high score, or are on a job.          Special thanks to earth_faeire for the following tip!        1) Play it on the fastest speed you can bear it. You get more points.         2) Take your time.         3) Take the long way round to collect the neggs - it’s safer.         4) Try to stay away from the walls.         5) Play it on the lowest quality - it’s less jumpy. (The same goes for all flash games.)          Special thanks to stephoid for the following tip!  on meerca chase, the very first move you make does not follow the rules of the rest of the game. u start moving forwards and u can press the back button, if this is your first move you can go in the completely opposite direction. but it only works on the first move of every game. i dont know if that helps at all but its worth a try!          Special thanks to silverdragondisciple for the following tip!  I don't know how many people have realized this, but have you ever noticed the broken spaces in the Meerca's tail on Meerca Chase on the Hard setting? If you time it right, you can pass through your tail. I've done this a couple of times now.    Nimmos Pond  =        Special thanks blackorchids for the following tips!        The main trick here, is to not move! Put your index and middle fingers on your left and right keys... nothing else (but remember the bomb button is "b" and the tounge is "v") and you don't wanna turn TOO much- it'll wear down your paddling, occasionaly stop when you're not busy to let it fill back up.         All weapons are good, especially the green "rapid fire" and the yellow "spread". It may sound annoying- but no moving once again! even the slightest tap with your up or down button will cause you to move FOREVER in the game! there is NO stopping once you go.         Bugs:  I'd suggest you go after the red, blue, black, and yellow-orange ones And remember not to move when grabbing them, wait for it to come to you! And if you don't get it (sometimes they dissapear just when you push the button) don't worry- you'll get others... if you see a bug that's changing it's colors- Its not really smart to go after it unless you are absolutly positve what color it is- it may change your weapon... colect the same color bugs for your shooting it makes it stronger) it get's easier with that.         Shooting:  Once again- don't move from the center- if you DO get hit with a lilly pad, you can get a red bug later, always shoot for one heading towards you (you can easily tell, because once they leave the screen- they area at the same spot, only on the opposite side) if more than one are coming- go after the bigger one first- incase the smaller lilly pad touches you- it'll give you less damage as the pads decrease in their size. You could use a bomb in this situation as well- but you should only use it when the bigger lilly pad hasn't decreased size (and is still heading towards you) and you're getting surrounded... remember- you only have three to start and the black bugs will let you get more. Your health does not restore like that- you have to get your red bugs. When aiming, try to get a little bit ahead of the lilly pad you're targeting, that helps you hit it more as it passes through your fire.         That's it! Have fun! And remember- moving bad, bugs good! ^_^    Pterattack Tips! =         Special thanks blazeofire for the following tips!  I'v played this game a lot, and it's a Great game.When you begin the game move the Pteri up a little so you won't get hurt when the Grarrl comes up.And try to collect ONLY 1 color of Gun if you keep on changing then you won't get a higher level of gun.My Fav. Gun is the blue gun beacause it's powerful and they shoot anything in front of you.Now, on level 6 watch out for the blue birds because they come form the sides. Here are they number of Colored rings you have to get in a row to get the ultimate of that kind.   ~Blinking White/Red Gun:3 IN A ROW   ~Red:5 IN A ROW   ~Blue:5 IN A ROW   ~Green:3 IN A ROW   First,Try ALL of the Kind of guns there are and see which one you like!    Raiders of Maraqua  =        Special thanks evilishies for the following tip!  There are six basic things in this game:  The clear bubbles, which will be pushed if there is nothing behind them and popped if there is.  The blue bubbles, which will only be popped if a rock goes through them. The rocks, which go through any bubble it hits until it is stopped by an obstacle.  The treasure. The aim of the game is to push the treasure into a chest. When you've done that, you move up a level. It is indestructible. The obstacles, which can't be moved at all. The small treasure, which you can collect for 10 points.   Beware of these:  Pushing your treasure against a wall. You can never get it off the wall, and if it is pushed into a corner, then it can't be moved.  Enemies. they can push bubbles or pop them, and if they or a bubble they push hits you, then you're toast. A special type of enemy moves at half speed and creates bubbles as he moves.  Traps. Consider exactly how you'll get your treasure in the chest before you start, because you can get trapped.   In some of the later levels, think REALLY carefully before you move things. One bubble misplaced could mean you have to restart the level. If you land a bubble or some treasure in a corner or a continuous wall, there's no possible way to get it off. Sometimes you have to place a bubble on a wall so the treasure will run into it and won't get stuck. If you can't complete the level, hit enemies with bubbles until you don't get points anymore, THEN restart.  If you have Internet Explorer, sometimes when you start a level, hold on the window bar, which stops the game, and try to figure out how to get the treasure in the chest so the enemies won't get you when you try to figure it out.    Scarab 21  =        Special thanks mysticsalem for the following tip!  I found a neat bonus move for scarab 21 that is not on your list: If your totals form a straight (eg 17,18,19,20,21) you will get 100 points and all columns will be cleared!          Special thanks Kosui for the following tip!  If each of the rows has a sum (other than 0) that is equal to all the other rows then you get 250 points and the rows are cleared. I've only done that once since it's really hard to get the rows to equal each other, but it is possible.          Special thanks hu_dares_wins for the following tip!  2 kings in a row -- 100 points and clears all rows  63363 combo -- 200 pts          Special thanks dancnkitkat for the following tip!  63363 combo -- 250 pts three 5's and two 3's --200 pts 5 of a kind -- 100 pts 20,19,18,17,16 -- 100 pts jack and ace of spades -- 50 pts 2 blackjacks in a row -- 50 pts    Scorchy Slots  =        Special thanks 1oddball for the following tips!  On Scorchy Slots, you can set your keyboard to repeat just like on dice-a-roo. When you first go to the game, press the button that reads,"click here to play" and then immediately push and hold down enter. Just be aware this game costs more, 5 np for each time you push enter. So you may want to set yourself a limit. It may be worth it, as you can win faeries and map pieces from this game, in addition to the jackpot.    Spell-Or-Starve  =        Special thanks _Tenel_Ka for the following tips!  Start out with small words at first but as you get on to higher levels look for bigger words. It is best not to use words bigger than four or five letters. Save your change-letter boxes until last and your little V.2 neopet boxes (the little boxes with that green figure in it).    Sutek's Tomb  =        Special thanks niteowl_82 for the following tip!  Full Screen option allows pieces on to be seen much easier,   Another rule of thumb is, what goes up must come down, if your making a move that's side to side, ten to one another move will be available up and down.   bombs are just like any other piece on the board, put 3 together and they disappear giving you points   If you have a choice between making a 4 piece move or a 6 piece move, go for the four piece because its worth 30 points over 20 points for the six piece move. ~the six piece move is like making 2 three piece moves, even when all the pieces are the same.~   if you make a 5 piece move its worth 40 points, if it falls into place its worth up to 140 points.   after 3,000 points, you will receive 1,000 neopoints   the suspicious looking scarab (black and red bug) once you get that to the bottom of the screen, it will blow out all the lower lines of pieces. **try not to pay attention to it, or you will run out of moves**    Swarm  =        Special thanks Cunobelen for the following tips!  Each time the bugs get to the edge, they move a notch closer... if they get too close they get hard to handle and you lose. If you concentrate on one edge and kill all the bugs on that side, it takes longer for them to get to the edge. Thus slowing them down and giving you time to dispatch them.    toybox escape  =       Special thanks melissagerrard for the following tip!  Plan your route before you move. Think like, if this goes here then that thing will die or if I dig or burn here I will die. Take your time you have 3 mins.   There are 20 levels but you only have to complete 5 of them at a time to get a password. A couple of levels you may have to think very quickly and if you don't press something quick enough you will die. You may have to try these levels a few times so that you know what is happening and know what to press very quickly.    Usuki Frenzy  =        Special thanks helen2110 for the following tip!  On Usuki Frenzy, hold down the arrow key of where you want to go while it's loading the games along the bottom. Also, go from the bedroom to the bathroom to the dining room to the kitchen to the living room. If in the bedroom, there is something near the top door, wait till you go through the kitchen to get it.          Special thanks ???? for the following tip!  on usuki frenzy it is better to put it on low quality as it makes sally the usuki go faster (it will not be as clear but oh well!) ! this way you can get high scores easier!     Volcano Run! =        Special thanks ???? for the following tip!  On Volcano run if you are scared that you wont get anymore sheilds 99% of the time you will get one during the score of 1800          Special thanks ???? for the following tip!  When you play it, look more ahead than directly at the scorchio, so you know what's coming. Don't look much back at the scorchio, but still avoid the obstacles.          Special thanks Lularliv for the following tips!  Ok this game can be fairly hard if you don't you don't know what to do so I am going to help you :):   To move your Scorchio through the volcano u have to click on the screen.   The shorter clicks you do the more forward he will go. Short clicks is useful when you are coming very close to a fast moving fireball etc..   The longer clicks you do the Scorhio will glide more. Gliding is partically useful for going through a tight squeeze.   Use the spacebar to help you slow down or avoid blocks. But I do not suggest this to beginners because I find you are more likely to crash.   Avoid the red walls, fireballs and fireblocks. Gradually as you continue the Scorchio will begin to fly faster so be aware of what is coming towards you!   ALWAYS try to collect the blue sheilds it will protect you continuely UNTIL you touch the wall, fireball etc... Dont bother trying to get the sheild though if it puts you in danger of crashing   Try to always collect the crystals they give extra points but remember if it puts you in danger of crashing it wont hurt to leave them behind.   Try to always stay central of the volcano but when you become to the large areas of space it is smarter to go high!   I hope I have helped and good luck on reaching the high score list ;)    Warf Rescue Team  =  If you type in trappedkadoaties during the game you are rewarded with an extra life.  Just be careful and pay attention while typing.          Special thanks x0x___angel___x0x for the following tip!   warf rescue team is a good game to learn, you can get 1000NP in less than 30 seconds once you get the stategy down.  For the Warf Rescue team, the biggest thing is really not to worry about rescuing too many of the kadoites. Just practice trying to get as many perfect landings as you can. The points go up every perfect landing in a row going from 2,4,8,16,32,64pts and 64points for each perfect landing in a row after that. You only need 200 points to get 1000NP which is just 7 perfect landings in a row. It takes about 10 practice games or so to get it down pat, but once you can get pretty consistent with the perfect landings, you can get your 3000NP for the day in less than 5 minutes  If you want a trophy in Warf, always restart the game til the first kadoite is on the right side so you don't waste any time. Use the perfect landing thing and try to stay as close to the middle as you can. As soon as you get a kadoite, immediately start heading back towards the middle. If the next kadoite is all the way on the other side of the screen, just skip it and go to the next one.  For the bad guys, the bird in the nest is easy, just steer around him. The guy in teh hole that throws acorns isn't bad as long as you're not directly underneath him. If you see him straight above you, just steer left or right and he usually won't hit you. The bee thingie is the biggest pain. If you see him coming, its best to wait until he goes past, cause if you hit him it will ruin any perfect landing streaks that you have. If youre trying for a high score if you lose your first guy before you hit 600-700 points its usually best to start over. Hope this helps.          Special thanks insane_and_lovin_it for the following tip!  On the warf resue team game, the maximum np you can get is 1000, to get the 1000np just get a score of 200 or above. Its not worth playing ova 200 score pts. Only play ova 200 if you are trying to get a high score!   Also do mutiple hits at one time. Aim and keep firing, firing and firing, u should get mutiple warfs on to of each otha quickly. This is more quicker and can save time. Sometimes the warfs reach the top of the screen and it takes a few secs so u can see over them. Dont do mutiple hits at this time as you can risk dropping warfs   When doing mutiple hits use the maximum force, this way you know you wont drop a warf!          Special thanks joyfull24 for the following tip!  Don't wait for a warf to land before you put on the next one. Make sure you won't miss though, or you'll lost some lives. After you rescue a Kadoatie, it's generaly a good idea to build toward the center.    Whack a Staff Member  =        Special thanks rjin227 for the following tip!  Type a5paragu5 on the start up screen of this game to make the mallet bigger!!!          Special thanks blackorchids for the following tip!  Strategy: For this game, try to hit the staff members in the order they pop up. This gets harder as you move up in levels, but it's the eaisest way to score in the first few. Those of you with tablets and know how to use them might find it easier if you use your pen as the mouse in this game...   Playing: This is a great game for if you get mad at the Neopets staff- just whack 'em on the head!   When you play, try to remember who is worth the most points. The females (Donna and Snowflake) are worth the most, 10 and 8 points. The male worth the most points is Mr. Ro-boto- 6 points. Incase two staff members pop up at the same time, try to go after the more valuable one.   Scoring: Remember that you have to get 75 points PER ROUND. This doesn't mean that on round 2 you have to get 150 points (well, unless you get a perfect 75 on round one). As I've said, the females are worth the most points. Also Snowflake tends to pop up more than Donna...   Good luck- and have fun! ;)    Zurroball  =        Special thanks karrie_717 for the following tip!  On zurroball, whenever you hit the ball above the line, look on the ground and pay close attention to the shadow. that tells you where the ball is going to drop. That way, you can get ready to hit the ball again! And when you try to do a grounder, don't send your score unless you REALLY did it. And newbies- When you just finished your FIRST game of Zurroball, be sure to think about sending your score or not. If it's pretty low (about 15-25), then don't send it. It's only going to give neopoints between 30-50.          Special thanks lilvampireslaya for the following tip!  This is a great tip I found out for zurroball. When you first come to the screen where you get the choose the ball you want, click on the little badge the Grundo is wearing. Then you will be sent to the game where the ball is the grundo. Make sure your volume is up! Then wait until the grundo drops close to the bottom. If you hear little beeps, this is good! Keep ding this until you want to collect you points. Then just hit the ball over the red line. This is an easy way to get the 500 points you need for the 1000np.          Special thanks extreme_tiddlywinkz for the following tip!  The best ball to use is the Grundo, and if you click on the N on his T-shirt on the front page, you get to play with him! There are lots of different ways to score points, like Freestyle which is the basic keeping the ball up, there's Right/left zurro's, which are hitting the ball against the wall, and grounders, and many more that youll discover as you play :)   To collect the points you just gained, aim the ball above the top red line. But you can't actually hit the ball when it's above the top line! :)          Special thanks Wifffler for the following tip!  Here is a list of all the combos I have found in the Zurroball game. If you successfully perform a combo other than a Freestyle, you will hear a beeping sound. There is a different sound for each move.    #1: Freestyle  Simply click on the ball to do a Freestyle move. Only gets you 1 point.    #2/#3: Right Zurro/Left Zurro  Bounce the ball off the right wall or left wall, respectively. Gets more points than Freestyle.    #4: Grounder  To do this difficult trick you must let the ball fall extremely close to the ground, then get it back up. I advise that you don't try to do this trick, as you'll probably lose. The best way to do it is by accident. To increase your chances, try playing with the Metal Ball. This combo gives you loads of points.    #5: Boomerang  To do this trick, perform a Left Zurro and a Right Zurro one after another (or the other way around). To put it another way, bounce the ball off one wall, then bounce it off the other, clicking only once in between. Gets good points.    #6: Around the World  This is the ultimate Zurroball trick. To do it, bounce the ball off both walls like in the Boomerang, but don't click the ball at all in between bounces. If you do it, you will hear a chime sound. Gets the most points.   Some other tips: Remember that to get points for any of these tricks, you have to hit the ball above the red line. Don't try to chain too many tricks together, or you could drop the ball and never get your points. Instead, pull off a few combos, then hit the ball above the line, then try to do it again. This way when you drop the ball you'll still have collected a fair amount of points. I recommend the Zurroball for these tricks. It's the easiest to bounce off the walls. The exception is the Grounder (see above). The other balls are okay for Freestyle, but they're terrible for tricks. I advise you don't use them unless Freestyle is all you want to do.          Special thanks tere27 for the following tip!  List of tricks:  1 pt each  Freestyle, doing anything.   3 pts each  Right Zurro, hitting Right wall.  Left Zurro, hitting Left wall.   5 pts each  Boomerang, hitting L wall, then R wall with next hit or vice versa.   10 pts each  Grounder, Bounching ball off ground  Around the world, Hitting both walls before clicking the ball again.   Other notes:  with Right Zurro, Left Zurro, Boomerangs, you must do one other trick besides freestyle before each next one counts.   The easiest way to get points is to do grounders, because you can do a lot of them in a row and still get points, as opposed to right or left zurros. It takes a lot of persistance to get the timing right, but once you've got it, it becomes really easy. The best locations to get points are around the bottom corners, because then you can alternate between grounders and zurros, and rack up lots of points. The best ball to do this with is the Zurroball, because it bounces back high enough to get grounders easily, and doesn't fall too fast.   Remember to put the ball above the red line every so often to collect your points. It's no good if you've just done 10 grounders (100 pts) and then drop the ball!!   This game pays off 1 point to 3 neopoints, so the maximum score you need to get 1000 neopoints is 334. Good luck!          Special thanks jojo290 for the following tip!  Well, i play zurroball a lot, and i found out a secret that many people may not be aware of. When you first load the game, there is a spinning grundo to the left. If you click the little blue M in the circle on his shirt, you get to use grundos instead of the balls, it makes the game 100 times easier, and you can get a very high score.          Special thanks roadrashx for the following tip!  On zurro ball there is a way to get 3000 np a day! Ok the best way is well first of all if u click the little N on the spinning zurro guy u can use him and hes he best under my opinion for my trick. Metal ball works but im not used to it. Ok what u do is u let the grundo (or what ever your useing)let it get close enough to the ground that u here a little *DING* then click the zurro ball and uve done a grounder worth 10 points each! u should kinda click the ball on its way down to slow it from going to fast u cant click the ball in time and it hits the ground. try to do about 10 grounders then cross the red line for 100 points! get 500 points and it doubles to 1000np! but u can only get up to 1000 np not over sadly enough...reply me if u put this up and it works 3000 np a day is very useful!          Special thanks Iamveryevilsolookout for the following tip!  For zurroball, if you play it when playing any of the wheels (fortune, misfortune or medicracy) it slows down the game, and makes it easier to get high scores.
