      I've been doing some traveling with my cats and one of the many odd things that I've noticed on the road was that the nice Canadians seem to like to call what we in the South call a "bathroom" a "washroom."  I will say that I would never dream of taking a bath or shower at a Shell gas station or a Winn-Dixie, but that's what we call it.  I've also read many reports to the effect that visitors to this place seldom make use of the sink; something along the lines of one out of six persons, so "washroom" seems inaccurate as well.  I've heard this euphemistically called a "restroom", but I don't remember going there to take a nap and it isn't on my list of things to do in the near future.   However, having said all that, "washroom" and "restroom" both sound nicer than the "toilet" sign that I saw affixed to an OUTHOUSE in Canada.  To me, "toilet" implies at least some visual sanitizing with a flushing system including water and not so much of an olfactory assault and no flies buzzing around.  But that's just my take on "toilet".  I didn't actually look it up.  I guess we could pretend to be British and use "loo", but I think "water closet" is actually the most agreeable term. . . provided there is actually a physical toilet that flushes.  Really, I hate toilet talk more probably more than anyone on earth, but being a physician makes it sort of an occupational hazard.  Literally.  I personally would rather drop over dead of gastro-intestinal distress than discuss it, but here I am, asking those sorts of questions for a living.  I just hate that.  I never thought I'd live long enough to discuss bowel habits and the like.  I'm sure that "Jimmy the Greek" had some odds on whether or not I'd make it out of my twenties.  Amazingly, I did.  And practicing medicine.  Internal Medicine, of all things, which makes "TOILET TALK" a real occupational hazard.  Patients who come in with complaints attributable to their bowels will be floored by the sheer inventiveness of the questions that we internists, not to mention gastroenterologists, will inquire earnestly about their bowel habits and regularity and what-not.  Questions about consistency and color and smell.  Flatulance and lack thereof.  More interesting and down-right puzzling questions to the lay-person, such as "is it oily?" or "does it float?"  Some of my all time favorites, however, have got to be such classics as "Is your feces unusually malodorous?"  Roughly translated, "Does your shit really stink?"   I'm sorry, but doctor or no, it is kind of funny, but believe it or not, there is SCIENCE to this.  We are not just making fun of you and having a good time at your expense.  Really.   I went to this party at a mansion called the Marlow House recently.  Overall, very dignified.  I had to excuse myself to the water closet.  Inside, I saw the strangest thing.  There in the W.C. sitting on top of a chair with a pillow underneath it was a horn.  Or more like a trumpet with which one would sound charge on a fox hunt.  I came out and couldn't stop laughing.   Later on, my friend Wanda needed to use the "restroom".  I told her there was something funny in there and I wanted her to tell me what it was when she came back.  Wanda returned to our table and said, "Oh my God!".  So, it wasn't just me.  As I've said a couple of times before, I hate toilet talk, but here I go again anyway.  What the hell is that trumpet doing in the W.C.?  I mean, I know a good number of my elderly patients agonize over their bowels and such; is it the trumpet of relief?  Is it sounding charge?  I dont know, but I hope people blow that thing with their lips.  That's all I'm going to say about it.  Someone at our table took a picture of it so I have proof.  That's how unbelievable that thing was.

      I was standing in line for the free movie passes from "Creative Loafing" for "Suspect Zero" in Atlanta with the other unemployeds. Mostly elderly and slacker types like myself. Since I'm technically employed and draw a pretty nice paycheck, I guess I don't exactly count but it sure feels that way, like I'm unemployed, that is. I have to go back to work in November. There are a few people on their lunch hours since the give away is from 12-1 p.m. make the super annoying trek but they're all suspect in my mind since it's not worth it to haul yourself all this way just to save the cost of tickets.  Anyway, there I was standing in line remembering how not so long ago, we called a certain style of shoe that I wore when I was a "preppy", a loafer. I used to wear them with little pennies on the top; now I am one, but without the pennies. So, I'm standing in line, kind of like at a soup kitchen, I imagine, and looking at the movie section to see what's playing and reading the reviews.  I love movies. Everything reminds me of a movie. Well, in this case, I read a review for Spike Lee's new movie, "She Hate Me". The first line of the review made me laugh and sort of reminded me of myself. . . if you substitute his name for mine. It read as follows: "She Hate Me" / F "An unbelievable mess from Spike Lee." I just laughed out loud standing in line. Sadly, this drew unwanted attention to me. A fellow loafer, creative or not, struck up a conversation. He asked if I knew what movie the passes were for we were trying to get for free. I said that I did. And that it was something that I actually wanted to see.  Unfortunately for me, I talk too much to anyone and I launched into a story about how I had run out of movies to see in the Metro area that I wanted to see, free or not.  "Really?" he wanted to hear more.  "Yes." I explained that I had come from an island in a rainforest in Alaska and that there was only one theater with two screens and hardly ever anything I wanted to see so when I came to Atlanta I saw everything, blah blah blah blah, yak yak yak.  The other loafer said, "You seem really very interesting, what did you do in Alaska?"  I told him that I'm a doctor.  He wanted to know what kind of doctor? He knew an OB/GYN.  I told him that was nice, but OB/GYNs do a lot of surgery and I get dizzy wearing a mask. . .  Oh, thank heaven, here they come with the passes.  Loafer, "You seem really very interesting."  I said, "Yeah, a lot of people have told me that. I'm not sure why, exactly."  Loafer, "Well, if you want to see a movie, I've got passes."  "Me too."
