      The physical manifestation of perseverance:  waiting . I suck at waiting. It'd be easier if it were  less  like the lottery, and more like eating at Denny's.  Here's what I mean:  At Denny's you order something like a "Grand Slam" breakfast or Bullalo Wings. The waitress asks the required, applicable, "Would you like white, wheat, rye, or sourdough bread with that?" And you tell her what you want. 20 minutes later she arrives with your food and you take it and eat it. If it isn't what you ordered then you tell your kind (hopefully) waitress and ask for the correction to take place. And there you have it. The lottery, on the other hand, is different. You buy your ticket and you have absolutely NO idea what you're getting. It could be a winner, it could be a loser. If you lose...then TOO BAD! No money back, you must take your loss and swallow your debt. As a gambler I have bad luck, not that I make a habit of gambling. Sometimes, however, waiting  feels  like gambling.  Jacob leaves home because he deceived his dad, and took advantage of his jock big brother. He wanders out of town into a new town. He meets this girl, she's beautiful. He finds out her dad owns livestock, so he works out an acceptable deal with her dad. In the day it was cool to say, "Hey, I want your daughter, so can I earn her by working on your farm?" [If only it was so easy nowadays] So Jacob worked to earn the hand of the girl of his dreams, Rachel. But here's the catch: to earn her hand he has to work SEVEN years. So he does. He sticks it out. Then finally at the end of 7 years it's time to finally get married. Big wedding, all the bling that you could imagine. In that day the wife wore a vale until the wedding night. On the wedding night Jacob and his new wife checked in to their honeymoon suite, and to Jacob's shock he learned that he married the wrong person!!! The father tricked him into marrying Rachel's older sister Leah! AHHH! So, since it was acceptable in that day, Jacob worked  another  7 years to earn the hand of Rachel...the girl he wanted in the first place. Jacob's experience in waiting is the most brutal instance. 14 years of hard work to get what he was waiting for, and the trail along the way was littered with disappointments and tears.  Why doesn't anyone like waiting? A traffic jam is not made up of people excited to wait, it's made up of people trying to get home (or to their destination) as fast as humanly possible. No one makes the pilgrimage to Disney Land to wait in line, and the purpose behind the grocery store is to eat dinner, not wait in line. Funny thing in waiting (that I'll repeat until the day I die):  When we (humans) wait until the last moment it's called procrastination, but when God does it it's called perfect timing.  I think waiting sucks because it means I'm not in charge. But it's funny, standing back and looking at the decisions that the waiting involves, it makes me NOT want to be in charge. I mean, do I really want "to be in charge" of my future? I'd rather trust the all-sufficiency of the Creator of the Universe for that one. And the point with waiting? I don't think waiting is meant to drive us crazy, I believe waiting is meant to develop trust and perseverance in our hearts. God used Jacob to play a significant part in birthing a Nation. See, God's plan was bigger than Jacob's. Jacob wanted a wife, God wanted to use the situation for something of historical proportions.  So my hand shaking towards Heaven gently opens to form a palm facing upwards, as I join the chorus in Heaven to declare that there's none like my Creator. He knows what He's doing. He ways are much higher than mine. And His timing is too.

      It goes without saying that I definitely want more perseverance. I want to rise above, I want to conquer, I want to run when others are hyper-ventilating, and walk when others are crawling. I want to push through when others give up, but I have to admit that I have a natural habit of falling instead of rising, surrendering instead of conquering, puking from the long run, and crossing finishing lines on all fours. I, my friends, am weak.  I'm encouraged today, however. It's not about me. I try and try, but it's hard to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps when your fingers are broken. Every single thing that takes perseverance are usually the things that mark an incredible life. And I want an incredible life, but every time I try to do something uniquely incredible it feels only halfway. I don't want a halfway life. But I read something today. It's funny, the only thing that is hard about perseverance to me is that it requires: patience, faithfulness, and self-control. In the Bible (Galatians 5) it says, "22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23gentleness and self-control..." I think I try too hard at the wrong thing. When you're led by the Spirit of God you act in those qualities, not because your smarter or stronger, but because your acting in the strength that God gives and not in your own delusion of humanistic idealism.  So with the morning I tie my running shoes as best I can, as I pray that today Jesus would work through me to be His hands today. I stretch my legs for a long run, that I'd run with vibrance and energy, as Jesus would take me into the places that He Himself would go. And I pray for His Spirit to work in me to fill me like a reservoir, filled, brim-full, of His love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. That while I might not be perfect, I may not give up.

      Tick. Tock. I sit in a youth center on the Fort Apache Reservation before opening for the school year. The hum of the ice machine sighs as the clock on the wall sings its own lullaby. The silence croons each inanimate object as I sit here and type. A bulletin board across from me catches my eye. With track schedules, autographed stuff from bands, and a couple of papers hanging, the jumble is relaxed but something has not just caught my eye, but my heart as well.  Tick. Tock. I'm caught by a missing person poster. Maybe I'm caught by it because I've seen the teen before. This page is a police department release. The poster includes description and contact info. What are his parents doing right now? What are they thinking? What keeps them sane when they've missed their child. "Missing." How did he end up missing? Was he misplaced? Did he lose himself (run away)? Maybe both. I feel worried for him.  Tick. Tock. When  I  lose stuff I freak out. I look everywhere. However, after a certain time if I don't find it I come to grips with the fact that it's lost. So I rearrange my life to make due.  Tick. Tock. Jesus said, "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?" When I stayed on the Navajo reservation I stayed on the property of an elderly lady named Bessie. Bessie had sheep. Bessie rocks. She could walk outside and know in an instant if one of her sheep was missing. One day one WAS missing, so she hopped on a four wheeler and went and found it. She reminds me of Jesus in that sense. Jesus always knows when one of His sheep are missing, and when one is, He finds it. I was lost...Jesus didn't lose me, it was me in my own sinfulness that lost me. But Jesus found me. Sometimes I get confused and lose track of my way, but Jesus leads me...even when I'm as dumb as a sheep.  Tick. Tock. "Jesus, thank You for finding me and loving me. Please help me to be more like You when it comes to finding stuff. And please help that teen to be found."

      Since the metaphorical can of worms has been opened, let's go fishing.  Perseverence. Before we wade into deep waters, let's talk about an aspect of perseverance that I feel is absolutely crucial to our staying afloat. This buoy is called "hope."  For me hope seems to be synonymous with trust. I trust God. (I'm not saying this as prideful arrogance, it's just the way it is) I have some friends who don't trust God. (Which is not judgemental in any way...it's just where they're at personally, and they'd probably be the first to admit it) Something escruciating has happened in their lives and they think that God's pissed at them. Even though in a few of the cases it was a bad decision that  they  made that caused the problem, they still find a way to make it fall on God, which, while I'm sure that God can handle it, it hurts to see my friends struggle. But even the ones that didn't "do" anything to cause the negative happenstance, feel that the problem is that God doesn't like them. It's interesting, there are people who claim to have all the answers, and whether it's right or wrong they think you should follow their "wisdom." (I'm in no way saying, "listen to me, I'm right!" I'm just throwing out my personal experience and hoping that someone can do something with it) I don't know why things happen to my friends, but looking at tragedies in my own life I see hope. Maybe not the warm, fuzzy kind that best selling, inspirational books are made of, but the kind of hope that picks me up off the ground when my nose is buried in the dirt. One of the reasons I trust God is that somehow in my darkest night the sun still rises. Or in other words, there's a light at the end of the tunnel...the tunnel may be long but not forever. Another reason I trust God is because when I need Him most He brings just the right people into my life. See, I don't live in a delusional world that is free of pain. I just know that somehow God will give me the strength to get through it. The world is a scary place: I know it, and Jesus said it ( urlLink John 16:33 ), but somehow there's peace that I didn't conjure up on my own. Brennan Manning writes in his book "Ruthless Trust":   "Trust means the willingness to become absolutely empty of all terrifying and comforting images of God that we have held, so that the gift of God in Jesus Christ may come to us on God's terms."   I trust God. I know He'll come through, so I can stick it out whether the trial is a final exam, a tough bill cycle, the death of a loved one, or an honest fear that tomorrow might not come.  Hope on the other hand, boggles my mind. I trust God, but my hope in Him feels a lot deeper than my brain "power." C.S. Lewis once wrote:   "Hope...means...a continual looking forward to the eternal world....It does not mean that we are to leave the present world as it is. If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next....It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and you will get earth 'thrown in': aim at earth and you will get neither."     While trust seems to be my strength for hard times, I think hope is my drive, my passion. Because (I mean) if the present circumstance is all I have to look forward to then: what's the point?   The first time I went snowboarding my goal was to get down the hill once, upright...without falling. For a half a day I hurled my body down the mountain, taking as many people with me as I could. (But not on purpose) My body was covered with bruises and while even my last run was far from perfection my determination was not. I contorted my body into more positions than a yoga guru on a twister mat, but loved my time there on the mountain. And the mountain may never forget me. I'm a dangerous snowboarder. I want to live life as recklessly in the love of God as I do in comparison to my unorthodoxed snowboarding technique. Sometimes I look foolish, but I'm determined.  Falling's inevitable, but I'm still going to try to not fall because it hurts when I do.   (And besides, there's hot chocolate waiting at the bottom of the hill)

       urlLink    They (people) say that good things come to those who wait. Often, "they" are true.  But what "they" often don't tell you is that it takes a chop at your sanity in the process. What inspired this series on perseverence? HTML. Gotta love it. Good news is that the blog's banner is up, inspite of my slowly fading patience. But this subject cannot be left here...so: TO BE CONTINUED.
