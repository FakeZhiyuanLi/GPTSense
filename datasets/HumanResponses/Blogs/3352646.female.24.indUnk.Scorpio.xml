						   Written with a pen and sealed with a kiss. If you are my friend please answer this:                                       Are we friends or are we not? You told me once but I forgot. So tell me now and tell me true, so I can say, "I'm here just for you!". Of all the the friends I've ever met, you're the one I won't forget. If I die before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you. And if you don't make it there, I'll give the angels back their wings and risk the loss of everything just to prove my friendship is true, to have a friend just like you!!! I Love You forever more...

						   There's some things going on, not only with us but between us. You failed to recognize the problem and it's causing me to battle within myself. You made a mistake and took away the trust and continue to make it hard to regain it. Because of my past you doubted my love, which gave you a reason to make the mistakes you did.  When do it stop? The hurt and pain you cause. Haven't you tortured my soul enough? Enough to know that I would die a thousand deaths, cry many rivers and yell from the top of my lungs to the world, "Amoire".  When I say,"It's you that I love and want to spend all phases and a lifetime with", I'm not speaking it just to hear how it sound. I want you to know without any doubts that what I say is true. So with all concerns and an acquiring mind, what else could I say or better yet do?

						   Have you ever seen the man of your dreams and wondered could it ever be? Do you believe in a such thing called a soulmate? If so, is there ever so a touch only you could feel when the thought of him cross your mind?                             Yes! there is...  He has every quality of being the man of my dreams and many more. He's not perfectbut in my eyes he's more than enough. I've made mistakes in my past that I'm not proud of and it's every day that I have to live with them. Only his forgiveness will lead me to leave it all behind. There's some things I would love to tell him, but where do I begin?  Do I begin with a simple apology? If so here it is..."I'm sorry". Do I then tell him the desires and secrets of my heart? If so look deep within..."my heart". Or do I just leave well enough alone and look forward? He will never be the sounds that I hear, he'll be the music of my life. not my will to survive but my reason for living. It is with him that I'll experience the wonders of the world. triumph over the challenges in my path nad his partnership that will lead me to the fulfillment of my dreams.   Once again is it up to him to know that I will not take him for granted but cherish him. To inform him that I do not need him, but choose him. Choose him today in witness of us. Choose him tomorrow in the privacy of our hearts, and choose him forever with the strength and weakness that life offers us.  He has no idea that he alone has the strength, patience and wisdom to calm my restless nature. Through him is where I would love to know my true self. I ask once more, where is it that I begin?

						   Last night seemed like the perfect time to tell him how much pain existed in my heart. I think he'll be understanding and afterwards tell me,"I don't have to worry,everything is going to be okay". He doesn't know that in my mind I see him as the man of my dreams, but, in my eyes he's something more. He's my protector.   We're alone and he's asking me,"What is it that's got me tensed?" Afraid, I slowly speak...Stuttering as if I have lost all breath within me. Every word and everything I once rehearsed is now lost. I want to tell him,"I love him and that he has a home deep in my heart, where to him no key is needed to unlock it". but then I look at him, pain in my eyes and he can't even see. Why can't he look deep in my eyes and see all the love and pain I have for him. I want to show him that, as one, our hearts can beat without the interruption of anything else.   Tears began to fall freely as he kiss my cheek wiping them away, waiting patiently for me to continue speaking. He still doesn't know or even realize that my eyes have said a thousand words and told a thousand stories within these moments... Silently speaking, I say...

						   Do you know the joy in feeling a new touch running his hands across your lower back only to say excuse me?  It's a sensation that runs deep in my veins as if there was such a thing as a natural high. That feeling that I get brings me to think I'm in need of him guiding me to wherever it is I'm destined to be. To be kissed with the slightest breath and the adjustment of my head falling alongside as if I have no strength within. He's holding me gently with one of his hands placed on my thigh and the other resting just above my valley-low!  The stare of his eyes see's right through me. Giving him the ability to stand his ground and become the man he's allowed to be. This strength he posses tells me that,"I am his and he is mine at that exact moment". My body begins to shake, letting him know I'm losing all control, only, I don't want it to stop. Is it possible for a man to have a touch such as his? To weaken me when I'm at my greatest, or is this a figment of my imagination wanting to know the true joy of a new touch?  Do you know?
