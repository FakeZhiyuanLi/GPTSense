      The Indianapolis Police Department (IPD) buried one of it’s own today. Fallen patrolman Timothy “Jake” Laird was posthumously presented this morning with the IPD’s Medal of Honor before he was laid to rest…   Timothy Laird, a South district officer since March 6, 2000, died early Wednesday morning the 18th of August, after he responded to a call that a heavyset, berserk gunman, Kenneth C. Anderson, who had just murdered his mother, was loose in a Southside neighborhood.  Officer Laird came under heavy fire by Anderson, a schizophrenic who used an SKS military-style rifle, shortly after he arrived on scene. Laird was hit once above his protective vest. Four other IPD officers were wounded in the 16-minute shootout before the suspect was killed by one of the wounded officers who was a SWAT team member with access to a high powered rifle; all are in satisfactory condition or has been released from the hospital.  Timothy Laird, a former US Marine, is survived by his wife and seven year old daughter.

      As I’ve said time and time again, it’s Kerry who has brought this stink upon himself by running under the campaign theme of ‘War Hero’. It was Kerry and his campaign that in the beginning started comparing Bush’s military records with Kerry’s! So now Kerry’s pissed b/c this whole thing has backfired on him.     urlLink  Fox News reported   that on Sunday, the Kerry campaign released a new ad accusing the president of backing Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the group which has released a series of spots calling into question Kerry's heroism. In the Kerry ad, the narrator claims that families are losing jobs and health care while "George Bush's campaign supports a front group attacking John Kerry's military record." The ad calls the attacks "smears" and "lies."  Well Mr. Kerry, Bush can’t back this group for it’s a 527 organization. Meaning Bush can’t get involved. Federal Law prohibits any direct involvement between PRIVATE organizations such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and anyone connected to a presidential campaign. Bush can’t advise them one way or another or he’ll be accused of supporting them.  Kerry, you need to get off your high horse and face the music here. It’s NOT Bush that started comparing Military records; it was YOU. Bush released his military records at your request. Kerry, you’re the one who has pissed off and re-ignited the Vietnam Veterans fire for referring to yourself as a ‘War Hero’.   So quit trying to divert attention to Bush’s military records and face your medicine like a man. This has everything to do with YOU and YOUR conduct both during and after the Vietnam War.   urlLink  Bob Dole told CNN's   "Late Edition" that he warned Kerry months ago about going "too far" and that the Democrat may have himself to blame for the current situation, in which polls show him losing support among veterans.  "One day he's saying that we were shooting civilians, cutting off their ears, cutting off their heads, throwing away his medals or his ribbons," Dole said. "The next day he's standing there, 'I want to be president because I'm a Vietnam veteran. "Maybe he should apologize to all the other 2.5 million veterans who served. He wasn't the only one in Vietnam," said Dole, whose World War II wounds left him without the use of his right arm.  Dole added: "And here's, you know, a good guy, a good friend. I respect his record. But three Purple Hearts and never bled that I know of. I mean, they're all superficial wounds. Three Purple Hearts and you're out."  Former Senator Bob Dole is correct here, Kerry needs to address these issues, instead of diverting attention to Bush’s military service. Vietnam Vets take this ‘War Hero’ crap seriously, and especially his comments he made to the senate in 1971, as Dole described above. It was and still is Kerry’s responsibility, and his duty, as an Officer then, and former Officer now in the US Navy to report, and name the names of those that committed atrocities, as he testified about in 1971. If not, Kerry needs to apologize to the tens of thousands of Vietnam Veterans, as well as to all those who have or are serving this country, whether it’s war time or peacetime, for the comments he made to the senate in 1971. They were uncalled for, and his testimony was unbecoming of an Officer. His  urlLink  Winter Soldier investigation   was a fraud, and his witnesses were discredited, because they were Vietnam Veteran wannabees, and many of them were never in the US military or even stepped foot in Vietnam.  And if he’s not man enough to fess up to the lies he told on those he served with or even release his complete military records, then he needs to drop out of the presidential race, and find a little cabin up in Boise Idaho and hibernate, cause the Swiftees such as O’Neil aren’t going away anytime soon, especially since they’ve been after Kerry since 1971.

      Congratulations to former University of Tennessee Track and Field Star  urlLink Justin Gatlin  for his gold medal in the men’s 100-meter dash on Sunday. Gatlin ran the 100 in a blistering 9.85 seconds, the fastest in the world this year and his personal best. Gatlin at age 22 years old, becomes the youngest Olympiv 100 meter chapion since Jim Hines in 1968.   This is what I was born for," Gatlin said. "This is why I started running, and this is why I live. I said it was going to be the most exciting race in the world, and it was. This is what I train for, that's why I shoveled the snow off North Carolina tracks. That's why I'm here. I'm here to win the gold medal.   Gatlin froze the clock at 9.85 to win his first Olympic competition. Obikwelu finished just one-hundredth of a second behind in 9.86 to earn silver. Greene's 9.87 steamer proved good enough for bronze. Greene also ran a 9.87 to win the gold four years ago at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Crawford, the last of the American trio, finished fourth in 9.89. How fast was Crawford 's time when compared to other Olympiads? Crawford's 9.89 would have won every Olympic 100 title in history with the exception of two. Crawford entered the 2004 Games with a season-best 9.88 in the 100, the world leader this year.  In the fall of 2000, Gatlin arrived at Tennessee as a good high school 110 hurdler. After training and competing in Tennessee's program two years under the watchful guidance of former Vol assistant Vince Anderson, Gatlin won six consecutive NCAA titles. In fall 2002, Gatlin announced he was leaving Tennessee after his sophomore season to join the professional ranks. Just two years later, Gatlin stormed the world stage to rightly claim the title of world's fastest man.   Gatlin becomes the first former Vol to win an Olympic gold medal in an individual event. Tennessee legend Sam Graddy won a gold on the 4x100 relay and a silver in the 100 in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.   Now that Gatlin owns the title of world's fastest man, fellow former Vol Tom Pappas begins his quest for the title of world's greatest all-around athlete in the decathlon Monday and Tuesday. Gatlin begins competition in the 200 Tuesday. Pole vaulter Tim Mack gets underway Wednesday.

      I read a few weeks ago that Iran’s nuclear facility was a concern of Germany’s. What? Germany is concerned eh? Well I’ll be; what’d ya want the US to do about it? Try going to the UN and see what they’ll do about. Or better yet, do something about yer selves! We kind of have are hands full at the moment...   But, I am interested in seeing where this Iranian threat goes. I guess Iran thinks that the US will not open another war front in an election year, so they’re going to run their mouths a little. I guess too, Iran has an impression that there will be no UNSCR action taken against them. If this plays out to be true, then Iran will gain another period of unhindered nuclear development, even though they’ve been caught in many lies they’ve been telling now for the past 18 years.  How can you blame Israel even if they do attack Iran’s nuclear facility? I mean they Israel destroyed Iraq’s nuclear facility in 1981 and the world should thank Israel for their act. From the Israelis point of view, it’s more of a struggle to prevent a lunatic government, as is Iran, in obtaining the means of destroying them with Nukes. Especially a government that’s been involved in financing terror against Israel, such as Saddam was, by establishing a rocket system by the Hezbollah that’s based in southern Lebanon, where they take frequent cheap shots at the Israeli outposts. From the US standpoint the last thing we want is a lunatic government creating a nuke, and having a revolution occur, and the nuke gets sold to some terrorist organization, and the next thing we know, we have radiological fallout over the Capital.  I’d pity the Iranian fools if they decided to make good on their threat. One US Aircraft Carrier would all it would take, but I’d love to see Israel open a can of 6-day whoopass on them.

      I’ve always wondered why Israel, half the size of Lake Michigan, whose population is half the size of new York, which garners 25 percent Arabs and what Jews are there are more secular than religious are hated so much by the world today. Even when I turn on Tom Browkaw tonight, I will come away with the impression that Israel is a world power intent on destabilizing Middle East affairs. And even Iran is now taking pot shots at her.   Looking at how far the country of Israel has come since the 40’s, I can see why they’re a thorn in the side of the Arab world. First, They’ve basically made an arid land bloom with crops and vineyards; they have converted brainpower into technical marvels and consequent wealth, all without the oil fields. Now, compare this to its Arab neighbors whose nations are dysfunctional and tyrannical, who keeps their people poor and uneducated, who aren’t willing to use their oil revenues as social benefits for their populations benefit. Yet Israel prospers while others fail.  Second, the world believes that Israel is the US’s puppet and that the US is an imperial power eager to put her stamp on the Middle East by the aid the US gives to Israel. But what you will not hear is that the US gives just as much aid to Egypt than Israel, and the thought that US involvement in Iraq is Israel’s doing is absurd.  Third we have the Palestinian problem. It’s interesting to note that Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was granted some 97 percent of the West Bank and some control over many Christian and Jewish holy sites, yet he turned the proposal down.  Fourth we come to the newly construction of the fence that many in the world has referred to as that of the Berlin Wall that separated East from West Germany. Many see this a sign of Israel taking land from the Arabs, but just as the Berlin Wall was used to keep the East bound to Communism. The fence is built to protect Israel from the onslaught of Suicide Bombers that wreak havoc on the citizens of Israel and keeps the constant threat of terror fresh in their minds. It’s also interesting to note that the UN hasn’t even murmured the words Suicide Bombers, which prompted the construction of the fence in the first place.  Fifth, the Palestinians are without a voice, with no means of managing their own news. An organization named Reporters Without Boarders has reported numerous occasions where journalists were beaten when they challenged Hamas or Hezbollah positions in the media.  As far as I can see Israel is an open and free society, who entertains every point of view, which includes anti Israel arguments. I’ve visited Israel while I served in the US Navy and I found the country to be one of the friendliest among the some 50 countries I visited in my four years in the Navy.

      What’s the big stink here surrounding this little girls communion you might be asking yourself? I mean, come on; it’s rice instead of wheat for crying out loud! Or is it….   The reason why this little girl was refused communion was because the Catholics re-sacrifice Christ every Sunday, by the belief that the officiating priest actually changes the elements of bread and wine into the  real body  and blood of Christ, the process by which this change is effected being called “Transubstantiation”. Therefore, they have to use some of the exact type of bread [unleavened wheat] that Jesus used in which He broke during the Last Supper He had with His disciples, before He was to be handed over and crucified for the sins of the world.  I must assure you that it’s not communion that saves! It’s not even a particular Church or religion that saves. It’s the blood of Jesus Christ that saves, and simply believe on Him [Jesus] as the one who bore our sin, died in our place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. Jesus’ resurrection powerfully assures us that the believer in Christ can claim everlasting life when Jesus is received as Savior.  We Christians should see the Lord’s Table as a memorial, a communion, a feast of thanksgiving, but NOT a sacrament or a Sacrifice in order to be accepted into Heaven, for our good works (which is what the Catholic Mass is) is that of filthy rags!

       "How will he [Bush] meet his god having slaughtered so many men and women?" Ahmed Manajid told SI.com. "He has committed so many crimes."  Well Ahmed, it’s called WAR, something you outta be used to since your deceased government massacred over 3,000 Kurds in 1988, and fought a long drawn out war against Iran, were yet civilians in the thousands more died only to turn around and invade Kuwait where thousands more civilians were killed, raped and tortured, by the same civilians, who we the  UNITED STATES HELPED to LIBERATE . Oh how we easily forget!   Ahmed, you should be on your hands and knees giving thanks to GOD, not your false idol allah, and giving thanks to the brave men and women from both US and Britain who some gave their lives to offer you the chance to represent in the Olympics a newly independent Iraq, free from persecution. Oh and lets not forget President Bush who had the BALLS to lead the way in ridding your country of that slime ball Hussein.   Ahmed, I’m sorry for your loss, but that’s the price you sometimes have to pay in order to be free. From our own Revolutionary War and Civil War, where thousands of civilians lost their lives, to WWI to WWII where millions of Jews were slaughtered and many, many more civilians that your egotistic mind will never comprehend were killed as well.  I know it’s the “in” thing to do. Bash Bush with all the other Liberal little hippy wannabe like mommy and daddy from the 60’s crowd, but coming from someone who’s seen WAR first hand, if you're an actual Iraqi citizen, long before the US got involved, you sure have a short memory my friend.

      After the tragic events of 9-11, the most asked question of myself anyway was why us. Why attack the US in the most horrific way? was it because of who we are? A dominate world power, because we’re a wealthy country? Was it because we represent ideas that are in conflict with the ideas of radical Islam?  One thing that did stick out at me, was that 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia? And 25 percent detained at GITMO were Saudi as well. These people weren’t refugees on the West Bank or Gaza. These people didn’t grow up feeling some grievance towards the US or Israel, because of the environment they grew up in either. They had grown up in a country that I thought was a strong ally in the Arab world.  So the question remained, why? Osama Bin Laden was known to be outraged at the US; because of his propaganda he used claiming US troops were stationed on “holy soil” within Saudi. The fact is that US troops were stationed in Riyadh and Dhahran, which are NOT considered “Holy soil”. Only Mecca and Medina are considered “Holy soil” and US troops were never stationed there.   There was a message in the attacks on 9-11. One was to the US, saying in a sense don’t ask Saudi Arabia to change, because if we change, this is what you’ll get. Second was a message to the Saudi kingdom, saying, don’t try to make changes because we radical Islamists still have enormous power, and it’s a destructive power, hence the twin towers crashing down. Third it was to the Arab world, saying, don’t challenge our control over global Islam.  So what about America? Why should I be worried or concern about radical Islam? Well, I’d bet before 9-11, you probably never knew what Islam was or who Muhammad was. Not until I moved to Indianapolis, IN and am living within 10 minutes of the Islamic Society of North America and working and living with followers of Islam, along with taking classes on Islam did I start to understand and become concerned.  Wahhabism is a doctrine of Islam at its most extreme. It’s the most violent, the most expansionistic, and the most separatist form of Islam that exists today. Its form not only lashes out against the West, but also seeks to take over and impose a ridged conformity on the whole Muslim world.  Wahhabism is alive and well here in the US. Islam was new to the US in the ‘80s and ‘90s and unlike other religions in the US Islam didn’t have an establishment. Muslims arrived and just started establishing mosques in various places. They represented an ethnic group that lacked structure to bring them together and unite them. So the Saudis decided to change that, by establishing American Islamic establishments based on the radical doctrines of Islam. By creating a set of organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, they were able to speak for all of Islam in the American Media. ISNA openly owns 250 of the 1,200 main mosques in the US. I’d say that more than 85 percent of American mosques are under the control of the Saudi government and Wahhabism. And we don’t hear much about organizations such as the Islamic Circle of North America, which acts as a kind of extremist militia among Pakistani Muslims and has a reputation of threating, intimidating and enforcing conformity in the Pakistani Muslims communities.  There are other influences of Wahhabism in the US. First are the prison systems. Chaplains representing Islam are Wahhabis and I’m not saying that they are recruiting homegrown terrorists, but anytime you preach a radical doctrine, such as Islam to troubled people, there’re going to be bad and dangerous consequences. And we’ve already seen cases of this. Second, the military, as Islamic chaplains in the military also practice Wahhabism. You recall the Muslim soldier who attacked his own company, or the problems with military personnel in GITMO or the man in Washington State who was trying to turn over useful information to Al-Qaida? Finally are the many Islamic schools here in the US that are directly supported by Saudi money and preach the Saudi Wahhabi doctrine to US citizen Muslim children.  So what can we do about it? Support the federal and state governments in investigating Islamic extremism in our country or communities. Support the FBI and the justice departments and others who are investigating. Identify and support the moderate and patriotic Muslims here in the US who opposes Wahhabism. We should hold the media responsible for its coverage of these issues, instead of angry Muslims blaming America’s support of Israel and other misleading factors. And finally, there are many, many Muslim leaders in the world that say they are ready to stand along side America and President Bush to deal a death blow to these terrorists.  It’s time we realize the real war on terror is actually war on radical Islam and until it is contained and dealt with harshly, we will always live under the threat of another 9-11.

      That’s right my fellow bloggers, Dirigo96 is one huge Southeastern Conference fan and an even bigger University of Tennessee fan. So expected a lot of college football Blogging in the months to follow. So let the tailgating being!    The SEC  We’ll I have to admit the SEC isn’t quite what it used to be, but don’t you underestimate the SEC; they’re still a strong force to be reckon with, but just isn’t the murderous top-to-bottom league of years past.   The schedules for the top teams are so brutal that it will make a repeat of the National Championship almost impossible. Let’s put it into perspective, we take a LSU or Georgia team and stick them in the PAC 10 and give them USC’s schedule and they’ll breeze through the schedule unbeaten. Now we put USC in LSU’s shoes with road trips to Georgia, Auburn, Florida and Arkansas, along with a possible rematch with Georgia in the SEC championship and you could all but kiss any chances the Trojans would have at the Orange Bowl this year.  Now concerning the BCS. I can’t forget that teams as dominate as LSU last year and Georgia in 2002 both had an SEC loss. Now if two other teams within the BCS go unbeaten, with soft schedules, then that means the SEC is all but hosed, which is why I’m not a happy camper over the loss of strength-in-schedule in the BCS formula.   University of Tennessee Volunteers:  I know, most normal football programs would be excited over winning 37 games within the past four years, but I’m not a fan of a normal football team, and my memories of the 1998 national title is getting a little fuzzy. And back-to-back blowouts in the Peach Bowl isn’t setting too well with me either, and I’m puzzled how that can happen after beating teams like Florida and Miami on the Road!  I’ve said this year every year so far and it seems to be a jinx, but this year will be UT’s year. It has to be, I mean, it’s about time all that recruiting talent over the years starts to pay off. QB C.J. Leak, OT Munoz and RB’s Riggs, Houston and J. Davis, they have to come through this year! Trust me! This is an SEC title caliber team if everything clicks. So don’t be shocked if it does, with all the preseason hype around Georgia and LSU.  And UT’s schedule is geared towards a national title run for sure, and of course it won’t be easy, this isn’t the PAC 10 we’re talking about. This is the SEC and w/ seven home games in the second largest stadium in College football, should help.  In my mind, I’ll be happy with an SEC title and a good Bowl game win. Now, winning the East would be nice, but I want the league title, but a nasty home road game to Georgia will stand in the way on Oct. 9. This is the key game, UT wins between the hedges and UT runs the table.   Stay tuned to more exciting UT preseason news!

      Iraqi PM Iyad Allawi has already declared the Imam Ali mosque shrine and its environs an open area for battle if al-Sadr continues to use it for a military base of operations, and as he continues to thumb his nose at us, by offering empty promises.   Al-Sadar is like that of a pesky fly that irritates you to no end, and he’s been a constant thorn in the side of this newly created Iraqi government since the beginning, and it’s time the Iraqi/US security forces put an end to this tomfoolery. The Iraqi government has in the past put a death warrant on al-Sadar, and they need to make good on their words.  Allawi is bright enough to understand the risks of attacking the shrine, but the risks of doing nothing while al-Sadr foments armed insurrection are far greater. No government can tolerate that and remain in power; eventually, people understand that the government is too weak to enforce their own laws, and they gravitate to wherever power accumulates.If the Marines are allowed to do so, they will leave no doubt in the minds of future insurgents where the power lies in Iraq, and this is a fact.

       A Swedish court has sentenced Ake Green, a pastor belonging to the Pentecostal movement, to a month in prison, under a law against incitement, after he was found guilty of having offended homosexuals in a sermon, according to Ecumenical News International.   Apparently offending a homosexual in Sweden will get the offender a month in jail, but here in the US the man wouldn’t get sent to jail over it. The worst it would do is get a few liberals crying on the left and praises for the truth on the right. I find this odd since about anything goes in Sweden anyway, but offending a homosexual in a church sermon is a crime? Makes no sense to me. It’s just one more reason why the European superior attitude towards the US is so wrong.

      An article from religion today has reported that an evangelist from Georgia has had his family’s membership terminated, because he shared the Gospel with two young men just outside the facility.   The YMCA’s stated mission is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that  build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all . But you better not mention the Name Jesus Christ, or you may get sued or fired from your place of employment or lose your membership at your local Y.  Why is that allah, Muhammad, Buddha or whatever fad religion is in style in San Francisco for the week is perfectly OK to mention in public, but people get so offended when Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God is mentioned. Well, I got news for the liberal civil liberties unions across this country, allah didn’t die for my and your sins, and neither did Muhammad or Buddha for that matter. There’s only one person who could save the world from death and that my lost friend is Jesus Christ, the Creator of both Heaven and Earth, and one day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, whom every tongue shall confess and every knee shall bow to God.

      Should the documented FACT that Kerry met with the North Vietnam representatives (our enemy during the Vietnam War) in Paris, France when he was STILL a uniformed officer in the US Naval Reserves, disqualify him from office per the Constitutions 14th Amendment Section 3: which reads.     No person shall  be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or  elector of President  and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or  given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.   John Kerry testified before the Fullbright Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1971, while our troops were still engaging the enemy in Vietnam and referred to his comrades as murderers, drug addicts and war criminals. His participation as leader of the VVAW and his association with the most overt traitor in US history to never be charged, Jane Fonda, both helped damage the moral and undermined our militaries efforts to win the war. Fonda traveled to Hanoi and demoralized our POWs and provided aid and comfort to the enemy. Kerry met with the North Vietnamese in Paris, France and brought with him their requirements of surrender for the US, Kerry provided aid and comfort to the enemy and damaged the moral of his comrades and undermined the military by his statements to the Senate in 1971.   Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled, or hanged . –President Abraham Lincoln

      With all the recent allegations swirling around John Kerry’s Vietnam record and his post-Vietnam adventures, I just can’t keep my thoughts suppressed any longer. So without further a due, this will be the first of a series of posts that will expose this liberal left-winger for what he really is.   To the average everyday Dick and Jane who never served their country, this may not be a big deal to you, but to some of us who have served our country, during both peace and war time, the actions of John Kerry during the Vietnam War, and especially after the war, are a disgrace to those who fought gallantly, and to those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom with their lives.  My beef w/ Kerry isn’t really all that much with his Vietnam record than it is with his post-Vietnam record, but concerning the Swiftees and their allegations toward Kerry, I say they have every right to criticize a man who is running his campaign under the banner of “War Hero”, who abandoned them with only 4 short months of service in Vietnam. Kerry can easily clear these allegations up if he would just release his COMPLETE military records. John Kerry has brought this all on himself. Real War Heroes take offensive when someone uses the term loosely as has Kerry. And BTW, these allegations weren’t just discovered overnight either. Kerry has been labeled a traitor long before he came on the campaign scene and his lies are well documented. O’Neil the author of the book  Unfit for Command , has debated Kerry for over 30 years. So this is nothing new to the Vietnam Veterans community.  Instead of Kerry and his campaign staff attacking Bush on political issues, they directed their attack first on Bush and his military service in the Texas Air National Guard (TANG), compared to Kerry’s fabricated War Hero record. Well, I have news for the Kerry campaign, but a War Hero doesn’t abandon his crew after 4 short months, only to come home and fabricate lies about atrocities that Kerry claimed were normal day-to-day activities (see Winter Soldier Investigation). A War Hero doesn’t carry the enemies’ water either. Kerry met with the North Vietnamese representatives in Paris, France and delivered requirements for an unconditional surrender to the Senate in 1971.  Now, may I remind my fellow bloggers that Kerry was still a uniformed officer in the United States Naval Reserve when his actions were unbecoming of an officer. An officer doesn’t aid the enemy by demoralizing and undermining the actions of his brothers in arms while engaged in battle nor does he meet with the enemy and discuss our unconditional surrender either. It’s one thing to be passionate about an issue, but John Kerry carried it a little too far.

        According to this news story out of Orlando, Florida, Linda Morales was fired from her job for eating “unclean” meat. Hired as an administrative assistant at a telecommunications company (Rising Star) with strong Muslim ties, Linda was fired for eating pizza with meat the Muslims considered “unclean”.  In an interview with the CEO of Rising Star, Kujaatele Kweli, he states that his company accommodates anybody’s religion and not just Islam. How can Kweli make a statement as such and fire someone for eating meat the Muslim deem “unclean”? The Qur’an says that Muslims are forbidden from eating pork, not Catholics or Christians.  A further study of Islam will reveal why Kweli statements are bogus. For one, Muhammad doesn’t call for religious tolerance; instead he calls for the believers (Followers of Islam) to make war on the infidels (Christians, Jews), People of the Book (the Book meaning the Holy Bible) and the Pagans (religions other than Christianity), until they embrace Islam.  It’s time America wakes up and comes to grip with reality. The war we’re engaged in is a war against Islam. Yeah, it may be called the war on terror, but where do these terrorist get their standing orders from? The Qur’an.
