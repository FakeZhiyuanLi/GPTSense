       The best moments in life are always spent with the ones that you love.    Yesterday was one of the best days that I have ever had with Kenny. We didn't spend the whole day together but the time that we did spend together was great. He went to the resort with my mom, sister, brothers, my brother Anthony's girlfriend, and me. When we got there we played pool with my brothers and then my brothers and his girlfriend went down to the beach, we told them that we would meet them down there when we were done playing our game. We went down to the beach to watch the sunset, which I thought was really cute. However my stupid brother had to runin the moment by throwing a can at Kenny which pissed me off. They decided to get drunk at act stupid, but anyways. So we walked back up to the resort and went into the spa, where we had some more alone time. We talked about things, had quiet time. Then we got out went and took  our shower (not together), hung out some more. Then we went by the fire pit and sat with my mom, and my brother's girlfriend. Then we started home. We were in the, the very back seat, he held me in his arms and we sat there and stared into each others eyes. I love him soooo much, and to tell you the truth, what I am about to say I never thought I would say, at least not at this young of an age. I want to spend the rest of my life together with him, I wanna get married to him. I want what happened last night, to happen ever night. When I was down on the beach with him. I almost fell asleep in his arms watching the sun and I loved that moment I wanna spend the rest of my life falling asleep in his arms. He makes me happier then I ever thought I could be.

      Have you ever wondered how your family would react if they found out your biggest secret that you know they wouldn't like. Tonight I found out that my whole family knows mine. My parents don't want me to know that they know, because if they did they would have talked to me about it. My brother on the other hand, I thought when he found out he would want to go and kill someone. Instead he talked to me about it helped me out and gave me the support I need. He may not be happy with it but he learned instead of getting pissed just to be there for me. Some times they way people act are really different then you think they will.

      I really hate it when people lie to me about things that they say that there going to do. Don't tell me that your not going to do something or you are going to do it, if you are just going to do the opposite of what you said. You know what I mean. This has happened to me twice in less then a week and the sad thing is it was from the same person. People don't have to lie to me, I rather have them tell me the truth then me get mad at them later when I find out they did otherwise or is going to do otherwise. Even if they think that it will hurt me I rather hear it from that person then from someone else. I really like the idea of posting my thoughts, its easier for me to get out what I have to say then always holding it inside because I am afraid of hurting someone or I am afraid that that person might get mad at me for saying what I have to say. This way I can say what I need and if that person lies to me or something I can tell them how I feel but not actually tell them because they might  not know this is about them.  Well my day today was really boring. I got up and I went to work. Then I got home and I did nothing. I really miss my Kenny I really haven't spent anytime with him the past 2 days. Yesterday he had to load the truck for drumline so I didn't get to hang out with him at lunch and then when I got back from lunch he was leaving and then today he is at Champs. Tomorrow I have to do family stuff because it is Easter, Monday I hope that he can go to Disneyland with us if not I will be sad because that means that I don't get to spend anytime with him during spring break because he is leaving on Wed., most likely, to go to the river with Matt, and other people I rather not mention. Tues. he has work and doesn't get off until 5 and we are suppose to go to Kokohos but that might not happen. Oh well I guess that it is his decision if we spent anytime together over spring break.

      I saw one of these in one of my friend's (Erin) profiles and I liked it so I decided to do one too. So for the first one I thought that I would tell you a little about me.  I am 17 years old and I live somewhere in the U.S. I am going out with a really great guy that I love more then anything. We have been going out for the past year and he means the everything to me. (and for all those people that say that me and him aren't going to last you can just go to hell.) I have some really great friends that are always there for me in my times of need and they always know what to say to put a smile on my face no matter what. They are always there to talk to and they all know that I am here if they wanna/need someone to talk to or just someone to cheer them up. Kenny, Erin, Jess, Bobby, Matt, and Jessie are the greatest people on this earth, they all have there weird ways of acting and I love it. These are the people that I love and always will love.   There are some people that I hate and can't stand to be around but like it says above if I loved those people before I always will no matter what. If you know me really well you know who I am talking about. These people may have ruined something for me and I cant trust them anymore or doesn't respect my personal space, but if they try hard enough they may get my respect back and my friendship which would be great. I would love to be friends with these people again it just wouldn't be the same as it was before because deep down inside I will always no what they did and have that feeling but at least I will still have that friend.    Always remember that love lasts forever not matter how much you try to let that love go, deep down inside it will always be there!!

        PROM NIGHT THE BEST NIGHT    I Had so much fun last night! Kenny made me feel so special, because all night he was telling me how beautiful I was. I cant wait until I get the pictures of last night they are going to be so good. However, me and Kenny's couple picture might be weird because of the way that the lady made us pose but I don't care as long as we don't look funny. I really hope that girls group photo that we get is the funny one because I really like that one.    All I have left to say is thank you Kenny for making my night so special. I love you more then anything.

       I am just afraid that I am going to loose him!!   Have you ever got mad at someone for the stupidest reasons? lately I have and its only because I am scared that I am going to loose him to someone else or just loose him in a couple of months because it isn't going to work out, and the reason it doesn't work out is because of distance and never being able to see each other. That is why I have been so mad lately its just because I am scared of loosing him forever. I love him and I don't wanna loose him I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. I am just scared that him going to a different school next year is going to break us up, or him finding someone else. I wanna tell him how I feel but I don't know how. Someone help me to not be so worried. I love him and I don't want him to leave me because I don't know what I would ever do with out him. He is the only good thing that I have in my life. Well I have my friends but that's different.   I love Kenny more then anything on this earth and I don't wanna loose him.
