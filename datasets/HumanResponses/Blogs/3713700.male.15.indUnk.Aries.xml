      Hi all! Literature will rock this term! Kevin Cheng's taking me for Singaporean Lit while Edmund Teo's taking me for Lit Stylistics. Kevin's quite nice but Edmund totally rocks!!! During Singaporean Lit, we just went through some admin stuff and introduction to Singaporean Lit. But during Lit Stylistics, we went through the poem below. The main theme is to get young people to enjoy their youth and well, have sex while they are still young... Hehe... We were preddy reluctant to say the theme of sex at first and put it in quite subtle language. However, Edmund went to the board and wrote SEX real big, and he said: "On my count of three, You all shall say this word loud and clear. This poem also has the theme of..(one, two, three).. SEX!!!!" It was quite funny... But this is a great poem in which the metaphors and images all fall together nicely to create this wonderful picture of youth. Enjoy..   To the Virgins, to make much of Time    by Robert Herrick      GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may,      Old Time is still a-flying:    And this same flower that smiles to-day      To-morrow will be dying.       The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,             The higher he 's a-getting,    The sooner will his race be run,      And nearer he 's to setting.       That age is best which is the first,      When youth and blood are warmer;    But being spent, the worse, and worst      Times still succeed the former.       Then be not coy, but use your time,      And while ye may, go marry:    For having lost but once your prime,      You may for ever tarry.

      Well, first day of school. Lugged my heavy body and soul up to my classroom, feeling stoned. But one i stepped in, the referencing of homework struck me and I got into referencing mode. After flag raising, sat through Math half-asleep/awake. However, the next lesson woke me up. IH1 - Lit Stylistics with Mr Edmund Teo. HE ROCKS! EDMUND YOU ROCK! First thing he stepped into class, he sat on a table behind, feet on chair. We quietened down, and greeted him and sat down, facing, erm, the front. He said to do what he was doing and face him (btw he was still on e table). And he said: "On the table." We were stunned. But he is real fun! We spent the lesson sitting on the tables, feet on chairs. Literature Stylistics - a module that is skill-based. To enable us to appreciate Literature, Life, the World around us from multiple perspectives. To enable us to see things beneath the surface. He conducts his lessons very casually. In a very relaxed environment. I love it. Following his lesson was reccess and boooring physics practical... Haiz... Dun wish to talk abt dat. And then came Chinese and English. Nutters... 4 double periods today man... Haish...

      Ah yes, before I begin my entry proper, XSLC RULEZ! Haha, anyways, after watching the play Of Trees and Boys by TCHS English Drama, we lazed around at the terraces, singing and talking and looking at the clouds in the sky. Then we decided to go somewhere. At first did not know where to go, den decided on the ice cream shop at 6th Avenue ( I DUNNO THE NAME OF THE SHOP CAN?! ) But upon arrival, we found that the place was packed. And dear dear Iffy had to break out a laugh just then and due to the exceptionally high ceiling of that piece of architecture, the volume of her laugh was amplified like many times and it was damn funny... hehehe... Anyway, coffee bean was full too so we decided to settle down at the coffeeshop opposite and eat prata. Quite nice, the prata, but the KOPI was GOOOD!!! YUMMYLICIOUS KOPI! Anyway, talked sumore crap and Iffy was sho sweet to treat us to the drinks lor... (THANKS IFFY!) Anyhoo, after that, walked to e bus stop to take 852 back to Yishun with Xin Ying and Lanfang... Chatted till Yishun den as usual, go home lor...

      Ah yes, first of all, THANKS RACH (for that wake up call)!!! Anyway, I woke at 2.30AM, went down to watch the match. I was sorta expecting France to play like a pack of hungry wolves. In the end, 15 mins into the first half and they were already looking like dead wolves. It was horrible. Greece, on the other hand, played wonderfully with strength, gusto and tenacity. They wanted that magical goal badly. France were still struggling to find their 'beat'. Passes were going awry, runs cut short by the stout defence of the Greeks, holes in the defence that were exploited, non-running players etc etc. Horrible horrible horrible. However, Greece played nice footie! Fluid football, great teamwork, great passing, good possession and players who are always on the move. The French looked like old folks playing against a bunch of young energetic hungry youngsters. The second half was not just as bad, France began to find their tempo. But it was not enough. Their defence SUCKED. 25 minutes before time, Greeks scored. Theo Zagorakis received a long pass, strode down the right flank, got past 1 defender, held the ball and waited to pick out Charisteas before chipping in a cross which was met by a superb header to slot the ball into the top right corner of the net. France was stunned. Barthez had no chance at all. Greek football at its best. From then on, the future looked bleak for France. Shots were going off target and they simply could not beat the committed Greeks. I think the French had only about 5 shots on goal the whole match. The Greeks troubled Barthez way much more. A high volley from Lizarazu in the closing minute of the game sealed it all. France were out. Adieu France... This was the greatest night for Greek football.

Den headed down to the cafe. Had dinner there (yummy!) and listened to great great music. Feels so good after studying like crazee for the past few days. It was just so damn relaxing (right Iffy? right Josh?). Great ambience la... Den Iffy was sho sho sho shweet, she wanted to buy sth for me for luck, budden no suitable shops around the area. Thus, she decided to improvise and pluck (tsk tsk) some nice lil flowers and bound them together with a elastic hair-band into a shmall bouquet... THANKS! Anyway, so we chatted and stuff, den I went up. Was not nervous due to previous exposure. It was going well at first, BUT I got too ambitious and tried for something i was unsure off. In the end could not get the note out and screwed up that small part. =S But the rest of the song was nice enuff according to audience. Ya... And den Evelyn (o0ps!

      Damn... So fast and XSLC is over... Loved every bit of it! It totally rocked man!!! SLC will rock on for years and years to come! A wonderful platform for youth leaders not only from Singapore but from ALL OVER THE WORLD to come together in a conference and NETWORK and SOCIALISE! I really cannot forget XSLC. On the first day, the ice-breakers were still lukewarm. However, as we progressed through the convention days, we got to know one another more. Not only within our own councils or countries, but within the whole convention! On the last day, during the finale, everyone became everyone's brothers and sisters, everyone was everyone's friend. The feeling of that bond and friendship and love just cannot be expressed by words. It was simply overwhelmingly GREAT! The items were quite funny, although some displayed the warped disillusional mindsets of Singaporean youth on homosexuality... =P But it was a celebration of friendship, of love. even after the convention, almost all councils from all countries went out to celebrate over dinner (or rather supper). That feeling, too, was indescribable. Last Sunday, some of us even went down to Changi Airport to see off the Foreign Participants. Although we were really missing them and reluctant to see them leave, as the chinese saying goes: "There is never a feast that does not end.". And so with a happily sad / sadly happy mindset, we bid the Filipinos, Indians and Australians goodbye. Goodbye to our friends, dear friends. I really hope to see all of them again. I miss ya all man! XSLC has really been an experience of a lifetime, a memory forever.

      Ah yes, the Finals of the above event took place at the National Stadium yesterday.&nbsp; Took e track bus down after seeking permission from Chen in e morning.&nbsp; We arrived, and as usual, went to look for Greg to get face paint.&nbsp; Asked e scout to help me paint Huazhong logo (THE FLAME) on my face... And after nost people arrived, THE GAME IS ON!!!  Cheering started! Damn we were rather ok lah... Not exactly very loud but loud enuff... Well, anyway, we knew that we were double champs once again.&nbsp; This year St Nicks took our place at e finishing line... Heck, who cares anyways, we're still double champs! =D (ego) anyhow, the races were rather fine. Sports School doing well in C-Girls.&nbsp; St Nicks only won cos they have field events. They won C-girls by only FOUR points.&nbsp; I think the 2 most exciting races for us were the 1500m B-Boys where Jeffery took 2nd although he stumbled at e start (look at today's Straits Times) and 4x400 B-boys. JIN WEI rocks!!!! Record holder jiu shi record holder.&nbsp; He had everything planned out.&nbsp; When he got the baton for the last leg, he was lagging behind the first 2 runners by about 5 metres, he chiong and made up that 5 metres, then took it easy, following the forerunners, din even try to overtake em, until the last 100 metres where he knew they were tired, and he BURST! With 20 or so metres to go, Jin Wei was the outright leader! WE ERUPTED!&nbsp; DAMN HE IS GOOD!&nbsp;   It rained rather heavily too, BUT WHO GIVES A DAMN?!&nbsp; We just rushed up to put our bags and CONTINUED TO CHEER IN THE RAIN!&nbsp; HUAZHONG SPIRIT!&nbsp; In the rain, alot of schools ran into shelter.&nbsp; St Nicks, Cedar and few other girls' schools whipped out brollys and had a brolly parade, but they were silent.&nbsp; SJI (being the nuts that they are) just stood in the rain and remained silent.&nbsp; THE CHINESE HIGH SCHOOL were the ONLY SCHOOL which CONTINUED CHEERING DAMN LOUD IN THE DOWNPOUR... It was DAMN SHIOK!&nbsp; To hear the stadium silent and only the voices of THE CHINESE HIGH SCHOOL... Those who had face paint started to 'bleed', but it was 'blood' shed for a cause. THE SPIRIT...   In the end, as usual, prize giving, double champs, cheered, school song, "Holiday" chant, Hon asking us to go home... B-boys wanted to hit 200 this year, but were 2, TWO, points short of it.&nbsp; And so, I grabbed my bag, went to toilet to change tee and met Ping and her friend.&nbsp; Den got a lift home from Ping's dad... Thanks again!  And Hon acknowledged all those 'elite' sports teams that won national titles this morning and let us off at 12nn today and tomorrow. Whee...  Anyway, that's all abt it and cya~~~

Anyway, on Sunday, went to Mr Tan's place for e farewell dinner for the Japanese. Much more people went, met Mrs Wong, Ms Kong, Ms Teo, Edwin, Juliana, Aizat and people... Was quite nice... Oh, Mdm Moliah went too and dropped sth huge on us...&nbsp;Northland is going to showcase its alumni very soon...&nbsp;And Mdm's calling for a major meeting to get stuff started... Wah.. And den went home...   &nbsp;  What's upcoming  Well, TRACK AND FIELD NATIONALS!!!!! On wednesday... This year will be a fight for the 'C' Boys... Slim lead of 40+ points from ACS(I). 'B' should be able to clinch the title easily, only thing is whether they can break 200.&nbsp; Expecting non-stop cheering! Hahaha...

Dammit, I hope my group can be judged first, cos i really need to run off for Northland's open house... It's going to be a hectic day man... Whooo...   Anyway, that's it from me tonight...

      Ah... Yesterday went for  espressione,  RGS dance and guitar night. Well, found the dances preddy normal, nothing really special... The guitar club's quite good, nice pieces played, almost lulled me to sleep, which is a good thing since i was terribly tired. After the interval came more modern dances. The main guitar piece,  Kuchusha , was quite nice... Then came a nice, fresh dance,  Bookbound . Following, the rock band came on... Frankly speaking, they were not all that good... Lots of room for improvement!  Soul Treats  was the last item and it sorta ended wif a bang la... Atfer everything, went backstage to look for the band ppl to give em tips on how they can improve and helped move some stuff... Den went down again this afternoon to help em further... And guess who taught em drummin and stuff, Joel (TCHS Senior, now in HCJC J1), Kelvin Li and ppl... Cool lor... Haha... Den Joel was there today, so we rehearsed wif the band, gave em tips and from what i hear, they've improved and were great in their second performance tonight... ROCK ON!!! &nbsp; Anyway, I left NYGH audi at around 1845hrs, got to AQH ( urlLink www.musicdreamer.com ) just on time, Ivan today jus recover from flu, voice not that good... Den listened to great music and de-stressed... I also went on stage to sing Love Me by Colin Raye...

      Ah, as i stepped into class this morning, saw Robert checking the results of Semi-Finals judging for Projects' Day. Peered over his shoulder and looked into the screen and saw: Service Learning at Care Corner Student Care Centre (Toa Payoh) - Qualify. I jumped. YES. For the second year in a row, Finals here I come... After 3 mths of constant service and learning at the Centre, we got into the finals... The last stretch to go!!! Hopefully we will be able to gooo all the way to the Grand Finals... Hard work pays off!  But I was very very lethargic during the day. Still recovering from 3.5hrs of non-stop HTML coding the night before Semis... Was struggling to stay awake through Bio lessons... Learning plants (urgh) now... How boring can it get? Math also... Oh wells... Assembly was rather okae... Den came physics (SLACK) and lunch...  Went to the Environmental Science LRC to check on my petridish of crystals, only very small crystals formed. Should be big enuff to harvest by tomorrow... Den can give to her... =D haha...  Kevin's lesson was next. we finally started analysing the text and my group's presentation on Chapter 2 is on FRIDAY. Meeting up wif em after lessons tomorrow...  Anyway, AMAZING RACE 5 tonight... Muz watch... den i shall sleep early... *yawnz*

      Today, had Projects' Day Semi-Final Judging... Was so damn tired, worked from 2000hrs till 2330hrs non-stop on the com last nite... When i stopped and looked at something else, my eyes played tricks on me: I saw lines lor! Then i decided to go to bed. When I woke today, my eyes hurt.   Haiz... Going through some financial problems now... Dun wish to talk about it. Tough times.  Anyway, judging went rather well for us. At least we didn't get screwed by the judges, unlike some other groups who have not even started Service... Before my group presented, I was reading through Fistful of Colours by Suchen Christine Lim (my current text for the Singaporean Literature module i'm taking). It's quite ok lah, I enjoy Singaporean Literature, feels easier to 'connect' with. And then we presented, and went for recess. After recess, I slept through the rest of e presentations, From 1100hrs till 1245hrs... Computer Room 7 is nice to sleep in... Haha.. The judges didn't care anyway, so long as u were not making any noise.... And so I sorta made up for lost sleep last night...   After everything, went to look for Mrs Mok and told her about our progress, den went to play bball wif Chan Keet, Marc, Jie Hong and ppl before going off to Environmental Science LRC to help Mrs Sow with the visit by Nanyang Primary... Crystals are so nice... Hehe.. really really nice... I have a dish of small crystals growing thanks to Hongyi, who was kind enuff to let me, Marc and Ding Hong have a petridish each cos he made extra solution... Hopefully can collect my crystals tomorrow... Den put into small bottle and maybe give it to her the next time i see her... =P Should be nice enuff... Hehe... ^_^  After that went for chess and went home... Haiz... Another day passes like that...

      Sigh... School's getting really boring... Bio too... SIGH... But Lit's still as interesting as ever... Another poem that Edmund introduced which i feel is really really nice:    He Wishes For The Cloths Of Heaven  Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  -- W.B Yeats   This poem, as u all can see, has the main theme of, yes, LOVE. It is about a humble guy, putting all his dreams and all he has at his woman's feet, telling her to be gentle with his dreams and him. Nice nice poem... =D  Anyway, during chess, I found out how GM Wu can be so incredibly boring at times. How I wished Mr. Petronic would come back. Or rather Lito than Wu... Hehe... Crapping... lalal~~~ Going back to help Chang wif his chess thingy tml... so... TTFN!

      France Grand Prix. Yet another classy performance by Ferrari! FERRARI ALL DA WAY! I koped the following from F1 webbie:    Schumacher unstoppable in France    Michael's seventh French win a four-gone conclusion  Michael Schumacher and Ferrari delivered a tactical masterclass as they stole victory in the French Grand Prix, giving the World Champion nine victories from ten starts this season.   Schumacher had to play second fiddle to Fernando Alonso in qualifying, and then for the first 32 laps at Magny-Cours, but after that a devastatingly clever reorganisation of Ferrari’s race strategy gave the champion all he needed - and more - to decimate Renault on his way to the 79th victory of his career. Only Jim Clark has ever made winning French Grands Prix look so effortless.  Alonso, predictably, got the drop going off the line, and as Schumacher slotted in behind him Jarno Trulli, equally predictably, vaulted ahead of second row starters David Coulthard and Jenson Button. Initially Alonso opened a gap, as much as a second and a half, over Schumacher, but it was less than half that when Michael made the first refuelling stop on lap 11. This was a surprise, since most believed that if anyone was running light on fuel, it was Renault. Trulli pitted on lap 13, Alonso lap 14, and Alonso kept his lead. That was also a surprise.  Now Schumacher came back at him, slashing what was at one time a 3.9s lead to a mere nine-tenths between laps 18 and 25, aided only a little by Alonso having to lap traffic. Then Schumacher pitted again on lap 29, and once more Alonso outran him, stopping on lap 32. But this time Schumacher’s lighter load had been sufficient to give him the lead, and he never surrendered it.  During the third stints Schumacher inexorably pulled away, and everyone thought it was simply the pace at which the red car would have run had it not been stuck behind the blue one. There was nothing to dissuade one from this viewpoint when they made what appeared to be their final stops, on laps 42 and 46 (Schumacher and Alonso respectively). Ferrari and Bridgestone were simply better on the day than Renault and Michelin.  But when Schumacher swept into the pits a fourth time, on lap 58, Ferrari’s strategy was finally unveiled. A canny change to four stops had given Michael a lighter car at a crucial point, and all it needed after that was the best driver in the world to steer it home - it never breaks down, of course - and the job was done. End of story.  Renault were left feeling very surprised by it all, but there was worse to come. In the wake of the two fleet leaders, Trulli seemed to have third place locked up all the way through, able to hold Jenson Button at bay until the Briton lost out to Rubens Barrichello in the final stops (Barrichello on lap 51, Button on lap 52). Button actually got out of the pits ahead of the Ferrari, but on the run down to the Adelaide Hairpin, as Button himself was doing all he could to close up on Trulli, Barrichello used his greater momentum to slip by on the inside. Thereafter the three circulated nose to tail until Trulli seemed to fall asleep with only Turns 15 to 17 to go. Making a tiny mistake and leaving just enough room on the inside for a Ferrari, he slid wide and Barrichello pounced with only the final chicane to go. To go from 10th on the grid to third was a fabulous result, overshadowed by only the two men who finished higher.  McLaren had something to be pleased about as Coulthard pushed home for sixth after a race-long fight with team mate Kimi Raikkonen, but Williams had very long faces after the best a once-spinning Juan Pablo Montoya could summon was eighth place. Mark Webber pushed the troubled Colombian so hard that he set fourth fastest lap for Jaguar and finished ninth, ahead of an unhappy Marc Gene, Christian Klien, who drove well, and the gripless Saubers of Giancarlo Fisichella and Felipe Massa (the only man to use a two-stop strategy). Cristiano da Matta and Olivier Panis were 14th and 15th ahead of Nick Heidfeld and Giorgio Pantano (who got a drive through penalty for pit lane speeding), and Gianmaria Bruni brought up the rear for Minardi.  Zsolt Baumgartner spun off on lap 32, and Takuma Sato vacated the fight for ninth place just after his first pit stop on lap 15, when his Honda V10 ventilated itself. One of these days Formula One racing is going to match the record of the 1961 Dutch Grand Prix, in which every car finished   And so you all can see, a classy Ferrari performance by the two maestros, Schumi and Barri. Ferrari.  To the Euro now, And so I stayed up yet again to watch the FINAL of Euro 2004. I wasn't rooting for any side. But my gut feeling told me Greece was going to do it. If they played like a pack of hungry wolves like they did against France and many other countries, Greece would win the Euro. With odds at 100/1 at the start of the Euro and 11/2 at the start of the final, Greece was the underdog all the way. I said in my previous entry that their victory against France was the greatest night in Greek football. I was wrong. THIS is THE GREATEST NIGHT and MOMENT in Greek football. Excellent teamwork and defending led them to victory yet again.  Otto Rehhagel, Theo Zagorakis, Angelos Charisteas , Konstantinos Katsouranis, Giorgios Karagounis, Stelios Giannakopoulos, Georgios Seitaridis, Angelis Basinas,  Antonios Nikopolidis,  Traianos Dellas, Panagiotis Fyssas and many more. Not very big names in European football. But a solid team. ONE team, GREECE. Excellent defending and teamwork. I salute you. A great header my Charisteas to win in for Greece. And superb goalkeeping(equavalent to the safe hands of David Seaman last time and Oliver Kahn during the last world cup) by Nikopolidis to deny Portugal the Euro. Go Greece!

      EPGY Outing... only 7 ppl went... Me, KX, JZ, Carolyn, Fran, JiaEn and Hancai. Met JZ at PS quite early... Waiting for e rest to turn up. Fran got to PS at like 9.45am and luckily, she bought tix for Spiderman 2 at 1315hrs first. Anyway, the rest turned up and we decided to go to Yoshi for lunch when sth damn STUPID and FARNIE and EMBARASSING. And so we settled down at Yoshi. JZ was first to get his food. A meal wif Soup and Coke. And so when he was walking to e table, his coke dropped. with tray still in hand, bent down to get coke. Coke put on tray couldn't stand, toppled over, pulling tray down, soup spilled. In the midst of setting soup right, EVERYTHING DROPPED. And so, decided to RUN and go nxt door to Long JohnS. Haha... After lunch, went to watch Spidey 2. Was quite a nice movie. I wouldn't say 5 stars. more like 4.5 stars. Some stuff was preddy cryptic in the movie.... Worth watching though. Shall not give spoilers here. After the movie, went to Secret Recipies for tea and guess wad, met Chen Shao, Ainan and Zhexi and those stupid idiots were running away from girls cos they din pay for e Earthquake in Swensens... Koped my brownie but returned in the end... Haha... JiaEn left for tuition... Den we decided to go to Fran's house. Watched Mean Girls on DVD, was good lor... Budden i only watch part of it cos gtg for Humanities Night. Grabbed a Cab back to school.....  Humanities Night totally SUCKED except for 1 performance. Everything was really shallow and crappy. I think the best script should go to the Farquar(pardon my spelling) and Raffles 'quarrel'. But it was quite wordy. The non-crappy performances was 'Voices', a Kevin Cheng production. Sua Yu and Oscar and Jianyi acted lor... Quite nice lah.. I reached damn early, den stone, hoping to meet XSLC OT. A few friends came and guess wad, OT came late... Cos they came from orchard.. *doh* Anyway, the performances were stupid and SHALLOW. According to a few ppl: "Dumb." "Waste of time and money.." "SHALLOW and PAINFUL". Anyway, after interval, sat with OT. Den as usual, went to talk and stone and sing at the terraces. Was singing with Yawen for quite sometime... DAMN FUN! Xinying and Tiff were listening.. Haha.. Anyway, there was this couple 'getting it going' on the terraces... Privacy eh? =P Den talked crap... XY and Daryl left on a LOOOOOOOONG walk kae?! We waitied for em until guard lock gate... Hehe... Den took bus back to Yishun wif XY and Dar, Dar say take 171 home from Yishun. Reach Yishun 0002hrs. Last bus for 171, 2330hrs. *bang* So in e end, lend him mahnee to take cab home.

      Ok... I'm rather happy now... Well, the first thing: I FINALLY GOT HER OUT! Wheeeee.... Going to Cine to watch The Village on Tuesday, sorry guys, cant join u ppl @ Taka for lunch... =P wahhahahahaha... Secondly, Not Yet has got out FIRST SINGLE recorded, although it was a rather sucky voice recording and i din sing that stupid *^$%&%*&amp;%^% song well (it was qing tian btw, but i dun sing that kinda songs).  Well it all happened like this, we wanted to use Vinci's mp3 player to record, but it sucks, with all that static shit.  So we got Goh to set up recording system with 2 condenser mics and NO MIXER for us.  Den my Mic and Amp screwed up, so i virtually had to sit below the condenser mics and 'shout' into the mics to get enuff volume.  BUT, shithead mic cant pick my voice up, damn farking soft and i din sing it all that well.  I screwed up 2 parts, but ok lah... Perhaps we should have recorded Heal Me instead, DAMNATION! Oh wells, but anyway we've got our first single recorded... yay.. =P
