       Yes.. the Title about is absoutely true ...everywhere... now and then... we have to plan on  where to go.. and wil the time affected..  well.. you have to be physically fit.. coz there is a lot of running here and there..have to catch up wif the bus.. or rather.. know which bus to take to our destination... have to complete the quiz after the reaching our destination... and we have to think fast .. do fast and oso act fast... it is generally about your speed of your thinking.. your running.. your walking... this is really important for tht.. I think that i m the most useless one in my group coz i dont even noe which bus to take or where is ended to.. luckily ..i have a capable teacher and student from other school beside me.. Thank god!. We actually are at even timing wif the 1 of the group.. but when both of the group reach the destination.. the quiz was "  Perform a indian dance OR sing a malay song".. i was thinking which song to sing.. but... a girl from the other group seemed to be quick-witted... and oso ..erm.. how should i sae... is tht she is not shy about anyting.. she juz sang the malay song.. and off they goes... den we .. were like dilly dally all day.. asking one another to sing.. well ... it waste a lot of our time though... after... a boy juz sang.. and we passed.. and we waste time on deciding whether we should take a bus to the final point or run there... so we waited at the bus stop.. deciding.. this.. of course .. waste a lot of our precious time.. the dealine is getting nearer and near.... 10 minutes away... we decided to run... we ran like wild cavemens... and were like encouraging one another that we musn't give up...  time passed fast ... soon it is oni 3 minutes left... Do YOU think that we can  make it...  we were like hurry up... but it seems so fast.... Yes .. we reach it... BUt... our verifying card were not wif us.. Oh GOsh!... the other team whcih is at the back of us.. were chasing up and the verifying cards have finally came to our hands... but unfortunaly .. they catch up.. and they were in the 4th place.. whereas.. WE were in the 5th place.. but... we have sucessfully completed our station... Some groups which are in the top place of us.. did not complete their station.. so ... we did not give up hope... the results came....... ANd... we are in The 3RD place.. hurray.....  Nice one...  it is really a amazing race....

       Oh&nbsp; god, i think i have suffered from the greatest blow of my life.I don't suffer in physical way... but in inner - self of me. Lots of tests come together continously... LOts... i really want to take a rest...this is really too much for me... i cant take it anymore.. The school gives tests like no body 's business... but in the fact... it is the student's &nbsp;businness.. i begin to understand why many student ask for transfers.. i could sae tht i m really stressed up at this point of life... Another problem that i m facing.. is perhaps confidentual... but.. i juz pour out my feelings in here.. now... things are still steadily stable.. but i can't&nbsp;predict what will happen in future... i have to cut down all my expenses... and everything... i have to discipline myself.. and restrain myself from getting way too out of hand.. i must do it... i was really breathless in everything.. i have to slow down.. Let out one breath slowly at a time... learn to&nbsp;know and live in life that i did not experience before... fortunally.. i have wonderful parents.. who think for us whenever they are.. i felt so lucky... i finally noe what does it mean by parts and puzzels of life.. i finally do...

       Geez,.. i have noticed a song sang by my   sort-of-idol  ... i think is beautifullly written.. i think it is a wonderful song... it really sometimes spells out the feeling when one have a crush on someone but..can't expose the tiny weeny secret to anyone but&nbsp;her perfect diary... the lyrics goes like this:   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Dear Diary, Today I saw a boy and I wondered if he noticed me. He took my breath away. Dear Diary, I can't get him off my mind and it scares me 'cause I've never felt this way. No one in this world knows me better than you do, so diary I confide in you. Dear Diary, Today I saw that boy. As he walked by I thought he smiled at me. And I wondered does he know what's in my heart? I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe. Should I tell him how I feel or would that scare him away? So Diary, tell me what to do, please tell me what to say. Dear Diary, One touch of his hand now I can't wait to see that boy again. He smiled and I thought my heart could fly. Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends? Yeah oh, I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends. oh yeah.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &nbsp;Isn't that beautiful? How i wish i can put this song in this webbie.. but unfortunaly.. i don noe how to do it...  so if anyone noes how to put songs in this website to be heard.. please tell me how... Thanks!

       SobxX...Things were not what I expected. OUr team is not "enthu".. The referee made last minute changes.. And obviously... Our plan had to be change.. Well..  this is really bad ..&nbsp; haiz..&nbsp; The oppenent's team were tough.. they are trained in communication.. they&nbsp;can read one another's mind.Strong... is the oni word i can describle them.For ours... our focus is all shatter apart... i was tryin to keep things in order... I hope to see a miracle.. We worked hard to keep the ball within our side... It was hard.. So it went to the other side fast enough...Den the other team threw their ball from the top of the court .. to the tip of the court.. It was clearly  foUL...  but the referee did not raise any objection... My heart was so much want to debate furiously with the referee.. but I know.. I am at the losing side.. stUuupid.. never mind.. I continuing playing against the opponent...Trying to keep my&nbsp; mind on focus... gRrr.. but whenever the ball was issued to us and one of my team member destroy the opportunity.. I was fumed up and scold the gal on the spot.. and I knew I was wrong.. but I can;t help it...&nbsp;haiz...the first halve ended with 1 - 4... they defeated us terribly... den the secound halve started.. a shot of excitement run through my skin... I started playing.. and again.. from my perpective... they foul without referee having any objection... I was so much wanted to get rid of them.... and the ball fly from here to there.. and they goal... again... 1 - 5.... it was such a embarassment.. we have to buck up... we started working with our mind and body... Coordinating them together...we started with a stragety.. joann and I began to work together... and we pass... here and there .. within our arm lenght.. and shoot...  gOaL!  great .. I thought.. things are seems to be turning....&nbsp; so we use the same strategy.. and we throw... almost.. almost....  SCORE.. Yes! I thought..&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - 5.... we are moving again... I think we are able to catch up... no matter wat..  we mUZ .. deN we started going again.. to Our dismay... our opponent team use their "infamous" shot.. and... it fly.. zoom past the captain... and they failed to get it.. YES!... My heart leap with confidence again... we began playing.. shouting commands... and Jojo and I did our trade mark and pass to Aqrika... and she throw.. Yes..  another goal ... hiPPY... 4 -5... things are working now...&nbsp; with the last few minutes...&nbsp; the oppenent threw the ball .. and unfortunaly.. they goal... 4-6..&nbsp; to tell ya the truth.. I was losing hope... a few more seconds.. we hope to create a miracle... and gOal.. oh no... NOoooo.... one of the oppenents 's team had slapped the bal; down.. and the game ended...  final&nbsp;results 4-6 ... haiz... its okae... wonderful experience though....

        Hi.. This is my first time coming here. I personally think that this is a very good webby. I was so tired out today that hope I juz can shut my eyes and let me float in the outspace in my mind.  Things are getting so stress up recently  .My class performed in Talent quest which I think that they done their best. THe dance was beautiful.I was so proud of my class.. hehex..i am not really implying that i am boasting&nbsp;.. i juz want&nbsp;my classmate who perform to know that i apreciate their affort...&nbsp;a little lame through... Haiz.. but i was so shattered apart on our class's internal- conflict-- it was definely scary and not worth talking about.GEez.. caNt say much.On monday is our 2.4 , and also our NAPFA test which means physical fitness test.. i hope tht i can pass and improve.Futhermore, tml is my chinese focus test, i haven study YET and after .. it would be a inter-cca-captain ball... i Hope band win.. BAND must win.. we wil not let others despise band tht we cant make it.. we have to show others about wat we are capable of.. even though we are not strong in fitness, but i believe as long as we are  strong in unity ... we are to be sure to beat the rest!

       I think it   really matters   for us to look on the bright side of life whenever we are feeling down or  lost or sad or whatever negative feelings inside you... this is very important for me as i go through this yet-to-come difficult ordeal of my entire life time.. I had noticed that i have a wonderfully inspirating ,brave parents who stood with the family alll this while.. i had notices this when this major problem (so sorry.. confidentual)  pop up of my life... i never had expect this problem to arise... hope this wil get betta each day... i hope very much... but, however, through this , i learnt to learn many kinda things i have yet to discover when i am still in my happy days of life... maybe this is a blessing in disguise... i   must not give up   no matter what... i must achieve something to make my parents happy.. and i will.... i hope... i mean i must....(can'T be discouraged at this point of time)..
