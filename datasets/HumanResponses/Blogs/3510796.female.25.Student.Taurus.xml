      Last night I said goodbye to a really good friend who is moving to Florida, I will see her again.  This morning I said goodbye to my grandpa, I will not see him again.   "There are few things pure in this world anymore and home is one of the few."     It's been a rough 24, and tonight starts the goodbye process for my cousin who is moving to Hawaii.   "I feel home when I see the faces that remember my own."    "Feelin alright, heading out tonight..."   Exactly.  Last night wasn't enough, although the girls nights always seem to make me smile.   "Well in the end we can all call a friend well that's something I know is true.  And then a thousand years and a thousand tears, I'll come back to my original crew."     Peace.Love.DMB.  |13 days|

      Wow, I leave for a few days, and look what Grey's done with the place!  Excellent work, my dear.  I should have you come over and see if you can work similar wonders with my house.  Well, my trip was long and exhausting, but an absolute blast.  Altogether, I put 1,100 miles on my poor Oldsmobile, and probably 10 pounds on my waistline from all that ballpark food.  Between Sunday and Monday, I plan on posting a sort of travelogue with stories and pics (I snapped over 200... jeez) from all of my stops.  And even though I was traveling by myself the whole time, I never felt alone.  You see, a few months back, a good friend of mine burned me a 3-disc bootleg of a Dave Matthews-Tim Reynolds concert from Purdue in '03.  I took it on the road with me, and it rocked me to sleep every night.  Gee, I wonder who could possibly be cool enough to give me something like that... hmm.  Anyway, there's no rest for the weary, as I'm headed back to work this afternoon.  And right after that, one of the peeps from work is throwing a party, so I'll be shuffling over there, with my party companion, the Green Fairy.  (You don't know the Green Fairy?  Oh, no no no... I'll address this situation later.)  And then... back to work at 8 in the morning!  Sheesh.  So yeah, there are things to see and stories to tell, and hopefully they'll all be up and around soon.  Also, I've noticed that we've yet to receive one comment on this blog.  I mean, I know it's only been up a week, but a little feedback sure would brighten things up.  Maybe if I start posting naked pictures of myself...

      rock  a rock of shape unyielded by a mulitude of events; emotionless form with very few dents  though time and time again it has remained unchanged for what might be forced upon; seemd so endless against the light of dawn  rock of a soul that stays silent  as space it fills; its spirit stays quiet against the rocks will  the rock stands strong, uncautioned and alert; unknown of pain, suffering and hurt.  my rock remains still through events of surprise and wear; dumb of knowing how much a rock can care  yet the rock stays on its own; cast in the shadows for rock is alone.

      I just posted a pic of my best friend,  urlLink SuperFly ,I guess it was taken at  urlLink 'The Bar'  some crazy drunken night.   If you read the article,take in mind, that was just one Domers opinion.  Hell, we are even mentioned  urlLink here   OK,OK--enough with the damn links in one post.  I get carried away.

      Posting isn't that much fun alone.  Where are you Sod?  Somewhere in another state.  I texted him last night before my class, but I got nothing.  Hope he didn't drive down that 8 mile.  :-/   Class was exciting, like always. I can't wait for finite math!!  All those numbers and functions and stats.... oh boy!  I had chips and m&m's for dinner while thinking about my psychology prof.  hehe.  That's another story.  After class I went down to  'The Bar' , where I always go when I say I'm going out.  Drank some Miller Light and watched my two friends play a mean game of pool.  Won against two guys.  Don't you just love that?!?  I do!  They were good sports though.  My friend KR had played some music around 9:30pm and we were still waiting to hear  'Nicotine & Gravy'  at 11:00pm.  I ended up doing the Play Now and heard it right away.  Yey Me!  Such a good song.  You know what else is a good song... urlLink this is a GREAT SONG ! check out the entire site while you're at it.  I can't get enough.  Only 15 more days and I'll be dancing in the lawn.  Can you tell I'm excited?!?  I have an exam tonight in Psych. and then I don't know what I'm doing.  Maybe I'll go to Target and get some stuff n' things.  Shopping isn't that much fun, but it's got to be done.  I always want to buy music.  Something else worth checking out is  urlLink jambands   OK, I think I've posted enough for today.  Hurry Home Sod!  ...  Peace.Love.DMB.

      Before noon today Sophia decided that filling a bag full of cotton balls would be a neat thing to do.  Then she proceeded to 'make a trail' from the kitchen to the family room with a roll of paper towels.  After all that, she wanted chips and cheese.  So she got the shredded cheese out and was shaking that all over the kitchen.  As I said, all before noon today.  Mo hasn't done anything too exciting, but he did unscrew the handle off the DVD cabinet.   urlLink So and Mo   I was going to wait to post again, but I have class tonight and then I'm going out.  Probably won't be doing much but sleeping when I get home.

      So last night I went to class and that was all fun and dandy.  It's Psychology, but we are in the Biology part of it.  Makes sense eh.  I dig the prof. though.  After class I had to go to Target and get a going away gift for my friend who is moving to sunny Florida.  Then I come home with food to watch the Pacers lose to Detroit in the last minutes of the fourth quarter.  Why does this happen to me?  Cubs choked just before the World Series, the Colts choked a game before the Superbowl.  Now I can add the Pacers to that list.   "Maybe Next Year"   Grrrrr.  I don't want to have to say that anymore.  Flim, Flam.  I'll be ok.  I still have Notre Dame to do me good.  Ba hahaha.  Tonight is another exciting night of class.  Three and a half hours of review.  I'm missing Sod, and it's only been a day and a half.  :-(  I hope he is having fun on the road and, even though he is going to the Motor City where it's all about the Pistons, he should have a good time and maybe he will wear a Miller jersey?!?!  OK, enough, I have to go before I get mad all over again.   Peace.Love.DMB.    16 days !  Glow Sticks Here I Come!!

               You Are  Grey's results---      When The Levee Breaks       You are a dominating person.  People don't stand in your way.  Everybody basically does what you say.  And if they don't, they better start, or you just might have one of your henchmen kill them.   Just like "When the Levee Breaks" dominates Led Zeppelin IV, you dominate your world.  You don't have time for nonsense (it's surprising you even took this quiz) and you would love to be dictator of the world someday.   You are dark and scary, and you probably don't at all care about this quiz, if you even bothered to read your results.    urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz

      Well, I started this thing.  I guess *I* should explain who this is...heh.  I'm grey, stage name of course.  This will be a shared blog.  I hope he participates.  Every once in awhile I'll come back and add stuff 'n things.  I'm a sports freak, so my postings might all be about sports for a few weeks.  Like now, my Indiana pacers are in the eastern conference, trying to go 4-3 over the Detroit pistons.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed!  Lets Go Pacers!  More tomorrow, after the game.  By the way, CUBBIES WON!

      So here we are tonight, you and me together... On the spur of the moment this enchanted evening, Grey decided that we should start blogging together.  I've never done it and neither has she, so hey, what's the worst that could happen?  Unfortunately, as far as timing goes, this probably isn't the most opportune moment to start up something like this, at least not on my end.  I've just returned home from the first leg of a downright absurd road trip, which will involve me seeing 7 baseball games in 7 cities in 4 different states over the course of 5 days.  Yeah, I'm pretty much a dork that way.  Well, okay, I'm a dork in a lot of ways, but that all will be revealed in due time.  So, for the remainder of this week, if anything goes up on this little heap of bandwidth, it's gonna be the lovely Grey putting in all the work.  Rest assured, though, when I get back, I'll throw myself into this project for all it's worth, give you the lowdown on me, and hopefully link to stories and pics from my week on the road.

      Tis the time of year to  decide what kind of birthday party so and mo should have.  Except this year its not up to me, nor will it ever be up to me again.  We all attended a birthday party for my cousins son this afternoon. Spongebob.  I hate Spongebob, about as much as the Rapers.  There was Spongebob crap everywhere.  The only reason I hate Spongebob is because he teaches little kids to talk and act like white trash.  Anyway, I choose not to let my children watch cartoons like that.  Done with that rant.  I guess Mo wants Spiderman, and the only reason I think that is everything is Spiderman.  Right now he  would be  Spiderman if he could.  Not to mention Spiderman is in love with MJ, the cute red head.  I suppose Mo already likes red heads, he tells me all the time how beautiful I am.  Awwwww.  And of course my favorite store, coughtargetcough, is not carrying ANY Spiderman decorations.  Time to be creative and make my own.  Dont worry, I am a creative person, so this can be done!!   Princess Sophia, hard to believe, eh?  She already conned my Mom into buying her a  Happy Birthday Barbie.   Even though that isn't a princess, she acted like one and scored a present.  The house will be filled with red, white, and blue balloons for Mo, and Pink, White and Purple balloons for Sis.  Spiderman and Princess, together at last?!?  We'll have to make it a red head princess. ;-)  I crack myself up.  Onto another topic, its that time of year where I am itching to get tatted or pierced.  For those of you who do not have a tattoo or a piercing, don't begin to understand the addiction.  Its been too long since my last piercing, and even longer since my last tat.  I have been searching this site and looking at pics of  urlLink all kinds of piercings , and I mean ALL KINDS!! I'm thinking eyebrow or ...., who knows.  :-Maybe that means I shouldn't get it done, if I cant think of any place.  I keep waiting to see it in a dream.  As far as the tat, I know what I want, but I don't know where.  On the flip side, I also know where I want something, but I don't know what.  Can you tell I am a real decisive person?   I got this kick-arse charm today-in the mail-from this really kick arse guy named Sod.  Its so badass, I cant even look at it without smiling.  Three guesses as to what it is.  OK, it says Dave Matthews Band in Reddish Orange letters and the background is Blue.  Hell, here is a pic of it,  urlLink Best Damn Charm.  Go there, be happy.  :-)  And now for my Bonnaroo update section of the post.  Dave and Friends played last night in Memphis, out in the corn fields.  I texted this guy to wish him a Happy Birthday and he was like, "Guess who I am watching right this second."  Way to rub it in!  Here is the set list-    Friday  June 11 2004  Bonnaroo Festival  Dodo  Trouble  Up And Away  Solsbury Hill  Stay Or Leave  Save Me  Oh  Up On Cripple Creek  Some Devil * Dancing Nancies + Thing ~ Tell Me Something Good  Gravedigger  Grey Blue Eyes  So Damn Lucky  Too High  Fire  Hey Bulldog  ---------------  Encore   Waste Ä Everyday Ä  @ Bathtub Gin Ä  @ Drum and Bass Jam  @ Thank you    Special Guests: * Dave Solo + Dave And Tim ~ Dave, Tim and Brady Ä Dave And Trey  @ indicates a segue into next song   Grey is a little more than jealous over Dave and Trey performing  Waste .  I love that song!  The Dead is playing tonight and I think Moe. is playing tonight.  Getting angry, so Im done talking about Bonnaroo.  Superfly started shooting pool this morning in the City Cup.  I just talked to her and they are in their third match.  If they win this match and the next, they will go to Las Vegas.  Haven't heard anything yet, but I'm sure I'll blog it tomorrow or the next day.  Go Superfly!   PEACE.LOVE.DMB.    |6 Days!|

        Friday was a Greyless day - no e-mail, phone, text, or IMs to be had.  Now I know how she felt when I was on the road last week.  Well, I knew this was coming, because this weekend is even more overloaded with stuff she has to do than one of her average weekends.  I know she has lots of stuff to do every day, I just can't recall what any of it is.  I could never cut it as her personal secretary.  Not only can't I remember her dates and appointments, but I also can't pull off a good look in a miniskirt and heels.  Damn my husky build.  Work was decent last night, even though I was swamped for a good stretch of it because we had entertainment.  (By the way, for the occasional stranger who may come across this blog, I'm employed in a bookstore cafe in the suburbs of Chicago.)  It was just a girl and her guitar last night, which I always prefer to some 6-piece outfit trying to cram their way into our place and then proceeding to blast everyone out of the store with their wall of sound.  She's been in our place before, and she's pretty dang good.  She did a lot of stuff she's done in previous shows, but last night she also did a cover of "Your Mistake" by Sister Hazel, a song which is a personal fave.  On the downside last night, I didn't get to go wall-climbing with my friend Katrina like we were hoping to.  Three people called off, so we couldn't align our breaks and head over to Galyan's.  Don't worry though, when we finally get around to doing it, I'll be sure to post all of the public humiliation that will undoubtedly result from me attempting an athletic endeavor.  Well, that's all from me for now.  I've gotta write some more code and swear at my computer while it gets all twitchy with what I'm trying to upload, and then it's off for the always-unpleasant midshift at work.  Until next time...

       88-68.   I think they call that an Arse Whooping!  Yep, I just called Kobe and he confirmed it.  I still say Pacers, but hey, what can you do?  O'Neal is still better looking than those Wallace boys.  Heh, I cant wait for Halloween.  Who am I going to be?  Who am I going to be?  I am going to be the Masked Man.  Yeah OK, I'll put the foil down now.......  F.Y.I.- 'Roo is underway and Im whining about it right now.  :-(

      Wow... blogging again.  Either I've got a lot to say or I'm procrastinating like hell on this website.  Yeah, I think it's pretty easy to guess which is the case here.  So, yes, the Lakers lost tonight.  I don't like to think of it as the Pistons winning, since I am only passively rooting for the Pistons to win, while I'm quite actively rooting for the Lakers to lose.  Anyway you slice it, it's some baaaad basketball being played out there.  I long for the days when a team could put 110 on the scoreboard... and lose.  Mind you, some of that was available in the earlier rounds of the playoffs, and now we're left with a style of hoops that gets you 110 points combined by the end of the 3rd, if you're lucky. On a completely unrelated note, I looked into the Friendster phenomenon earlier today.  I read an article about it a while back, and my friend Britt is on it, so I decided to see what the fuss is all about.  I didn't sign up, mainly because I don't get it.  Is it some kind of dating thing?  You just meet people, somehow, through someone, and then something happens.  I don't know about it, and I'm really reluctant about throwing a pic of me up there for all the Friendster world to see.  So, what's the story on this thing?  If anyone out there can give me some feedback, it would be ever so appreciated.  7 days and 8 hours (give or take a few minutes) until Grey and I are on the lawn at The World, taking in all that is good and Dave.  For all kinds of reasons, I can't wait.

      My head is spinning right now.  One of those stress headaches that just lingers has permeated my skull, taken up residence in my forehead, and has let me know that it plans on being there for awhile.  I spent my day off running around doing errands and grocery shopping, and my evening (and some of the morning) has been spent with my eyes plastered on my monitor, doing mundane Photoshop work and writing raw HTML code as I rework a website I've been paid to maintain.  The weather is a mess, streets have spontaneously turned into lakes, and before it was raining today, it was the unbearably warm and sticky weather that turns my sinuses into a living hell, and, as an added bonus, makes every sweat gland in my body open up and start gushing.  The end result is the man that sits before you: tired and clammy, with bloodshot slits for eyes and a forehead that feels like I've been pulling a Happy Gilmore in a batting cage. Inventory is coming this weekend.  It's that special moment in retail where everything in your store has to be perfectly arranged so it can be counted by people with adding machines strapped to their pants who, collectively, have the intelligence of a hamster.  Hey, I can make fun of these people, I used to be one.  For what were arguably 7 of the worst months of my working life, I went from store to store in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs counting stuff with my mind as numb as possible.  I made fast friends with the only person capable of thinking on the same wavelength as me - and we both ended up meeting the same fate by getting fired from that job.  Anyway, I'll be working from 12 noon till 3 am on Sunday, supervising, assisting, and correcting this assortment of dopes.  Thank God for the overtime and the free pizza. As for the website thingy, well, I'm not posting any of the details on that until I've uploaded a somewhat-finished product.  But I will say this for now: talking with Grey is always enjoyable.  But talking with her at 1 in the morning when we're both half-asleep and a bit slap-happy, well, that's a very special kind of fun.

      As of today, I am hooked on  urlLink Life at TJ's Place   I went back and read from the very first entry this morning and this evening.  Is it right that I blog to promote someone else?  No idea.  But I know it intrigues me.  There are clubs around here, but I do not frequent them, only because they are pretty skanky. Kind of like  Easy Skanin'   by Bob Marley.   Excuse me while I light my spliff.    OK, sitting here cracking up over something I told Sod last night and now I have to share to the unknown.  Do we all know what the Honor Guard is?  For those who do not, the Honor Guard are the guys who come out to special functions, ie. parades, funerals and the like, to perform the 21 Gun Salute. So the South Bend Tribune had an article about a parade in Plymouth.  Apparently the Firing Squad was going to be there, instead of the Honor Guard.  Anyone want to join me?  Didn't think so.  Oh man, this story was so much better this morning at 1:30am.  Wait, when did I talk to Sod?  God, I can not remember what time it was.  I remember half getting the story out, half cracking up and tears rolling down my cheek.   Big game tonight.  D Town and the Rapers.  ps.  Grey  hates  the Lakers.  This chick who sits behind me in psychology said tonight and I quote, "Kobe is amazing!".  I wanted to turn around and ask if it was amazing he cheated on his wife.  I'm not mad though.  At this point, I just want the Pistons to beat some Laker arse.  Yeah, arse.  I can spell, but arse comes from the Misho term meaning ass.  Got it?  Good.  Who is Misho?  Well, nevermind that.  Whoa, I cant believe I just spotted him a name drop.  Gah!   .....went to the funeral for superflys mom this afternoon.  I don't know about you, but when I go to funerals, I just think about every other one I've been to and it just makes it that much worse.  My cousin showed up and then all I thought about was last year at her dads funeral.  So then I drove home on 2, in the rain and went to class, took the quiz, which I only missed one, and then headed to my uncles sisters viewing.  Funeral is tomorrow.   I have no Joys of So and Mo today since I dropped them off at 11:30 this morning and just now got home an hour ago.  Pretty soon it will be shower and bed time.  Then Mommy time.  Whatever that means.  I need suggestions. I think that should do it for tonight.  Oh wait---  My Milkshake is better than yours.  Damn right!  Whoa, ho, what did I just admit to?                   I'll feed you fruit that don't exist                        I'll leave graffiti                   Where you've never been kissed                        I'll do your laundry                          Massage your soul                         I'll turn you over                        To the highway patrol    PEACE.LOVE.DMB.  | 8 days! |

      ...this email about ramblings and I wanted to share some that I thought were funny so we can all say ha ha.    Does a clean house indicate that there is a broken computer in it?  -Most likely   Why do people constantly return to the refrigerator with the hopes  that something new to eat will have materialized?  -Oh My God!  I do this  all  the time.   Why do people keep running over a string a dozen times with their vacuum cleaner, then reach down, pick it up, examine it, then put it down to give their vacuum one more chance?  -Damn Lazy People    In winter, why do we try to keep the house as warm as it was in summer when we complained about the heat?  -Ain't that the truth!!   Why is it that men can react to broken bones as 'just a sprain' and deep wounds as 'just a scratch', but when they get the sniffles they are deathly ill 'with the flu' and have to be bedridden for weeks?  -Because men are babies....  Mike, Evan, Kasey, Stephen-you guys are OK by me.   :-)  Everyone else, you know who you are.

      It's another Tuesday night and I ain't got nobody....nah, I don't have any money either.  Well, I do, but it's spent already.  The weather here isn't getting any better.  A scorching 89 degrees today.  I had to go out to the store this morning and I couldn't stand it.  The average temperature in Hawaii in July is 75!  How can that be?  I cant wait to go to Hawaii in March/April next year.  Better start saving that skrilla.   I was reading a post on  urlLink nancies  tonight about thinking a song said something it didn't say.  I have made a few mistakes like this, but my favorite one is when I thought the lyrics for  Long December  was,  "I drove up to hill side, met her sometime after 2 am..."  and it is really,  "Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 am..."   Anyway, I get a kick out of things like that.  Mostly because I'm boring.  haha.  I told Sod tonight I needed to date an athlete so I could have something to do, somewhere to go.  Someone to cheer for.  As if I don't do enough already.  Side note, I read in the paper that the head coach for the University of Michigan now wants to play IU in the opener before Notre Dame because he found out Notre Dame moved the BYU game one week before we play U of M.  Old guys acting like little kids.  This should be interesting.  But come on, IU?  Does he think IU is going to give them a challenge like the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame?  No silly comments required.    It's getting kind of late and I get to thinking of someone who is going to the 'Roo this weekend and I wonder what he is doing now.  Throwing them disc's and drinking beer.  I wish I was going to Memphis this weekend for all that.  When its all said and done, Ill post links for the reviews.  For now, I'm going to......

      I don't know why, but it hit me tonight that I am "old" and "past it".  Well, at least as far as the cannibalizing culture of pop music goes, I am.  On the drive home tonight, I flipped over to the local college station, because, as has increasingly become the case, the commercial stations had nothing to offer me.  And when you've got a car that doesn't even have a tape deck, well, you become pretty handy at scanning the dial.  So I hear two songs in a row that take me back - way back - "Pepper" by Butthole Surfers and "Popular" by Nada Surf.  Do you realize those songs are from 1996?  8 f'ing years ago?!?  I find myself complaining more and more about "the music these kids liten to these days..."  Next thing you know, I'll be telling them to get off my damn lawn.  For me, the best of pop music originates from an era which, I suppose it does for many others, as well - the later years of high school and the first few of college, about 1994-99 in my case.  After that, everyone just started screaming - a lot.  Angry gradually took the place of melancholy, things like melody and harmony got tossed aside in favor of fast and frantic, and one day, you look around and find that a retard like Fred Durst has gone multi-platinum, and Kid Rock's rolling in 8 figures a year for rapping about Pabst Blue Ribbon with a midget.  Oh, you say you wanna find a female voice on a rock - or even alternative - station?  Unless it's Courtney Love, good luck.  Bands like Garbage, Radiohead, U2, Oasis - bands that once defined a genre, would now be considered way too light to even be considered for airplay by any rock or alternative station programmer.  Dave Matthews now sings of how he loves you oh so well on a station targeted toward soccer moms and other assorted thirtysomethings.  There are bands on the radio right now - the one that comes to mind at the moment is called Story of the Year - where you can listen to their songs and practically hear the record executive say, "Listen, guys, we're never gonna be able to sell this unless you throw some screaming in these tracks at some point."  So, what's a pop-music fiend and self-avowed radio junkie like myself to do?  Well, on my recent road trip, I found temporary solace and refuge.  There are two stations in Michigan - one in Grand Rapids, one in Detroit - that call themselves "alternative" and play music from the 90s as well as the stuff from today.  Someone out there figured out how to successfully include the music of the past decade with a solid rotation of current tracks.  It doesn't sound like something that should be hard to figure out, but the so-called alternative station in Chicago really doesn't care to recognize the 1990s unless it involves Nirvana or Metallica, outside of their specialty show at noon.  Here's hoping this twaeking of a format takes off, so I won't have to spend so much time driving with one hand on the wheel and one on the tuner buttons.  In the meantime, here's where I can cop my musical fix.   urlLink WGRD Grand Rapids  - one of the stations that gave me happiness in Michigan - and they stream!   urlLink 93 XRT Radio Chicago  - They call it Chicago's finest rock, and it is.  from the '60s up to today, they cover a wide area.  It's not always what I want to listen to, but it's got a lot of good going for it.   urlLink WXAV 88.3 Chicago  - Ah, college rock, or as I call it, Russian Roulette Radio.  You're just as likely to find something you haven't heard in forever and love as you are to hear something you've never heard before and loathe.  As for the station in D-Town, well, they don't stream, but their website is  urlLink here.

      As I sit here I now have two funerals to attend this week.  It seems a little odd, I know.  This morning I found out my uncles sister passed away.  I just have to say she was a very nice lady who did a lot for her family.  I hope I wont have to post anymore about people I know who have passed on.   This is just something I wanted to add, whatever it means to you is good for me.     Smile  Sitting here thinking about the times we shared The love you gave so freely lets me know you care In spite of all the things we've been through I know it was only a test And now I wish that you were here with me to cure my loneliness   I'll just smile when I think of all the good times I just smile when I think about all the joy you bring When I think about how you touched my life  And how you set my spirit free I just smile when I think about all you've done for me   I never knew before we met what love could do for me And when we were together I saw how strong I could be With all the space between us I still feel you are here And all the love that's in my heart keeps you near   -Robert Randolph & The Family Band-  {I just called to make an appointment to get my hair cut again, I cant stand it in my face anymore.  This will be the third time I'll have it cut in 6 months.  So I wanted it done before I go see Dave on the 18th, and when can she get me in?....THAT MORNING at 8:45AM!}  What kind of shiii is that?!?  But at least I wont have a sweaty neck! HA!  Mmmmm, sweaty neck.  Joys of my two bundles of....joy?  Yesterday we had some family over for dinner.  While we were all outside on the deck, Sophia and Mo went inside and when I decided to go check on them, the salt was all over the counter, the kitchen floor and anywhere else she could shake it... shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture.....  What did she say when I told her that was naughty?  "You should have put it away so I couldn't get it."  No kidding Sophia.  You should keep your little hands to yourself!  What else happened yesterday, oh yeah.  She got the cherry syrup for slushies and poured it on the carpet.  Mo told on her and she got mad at him.  Oh well girlie.  All the adventures of one rolled into TWO!   I found a blog today about a  urlLink guy who works at a strip club in the Midwest, .  He mentions the Colts.  So this place might be near me.  :-\  Maybe I should be a dancer....nah.  I already had this conversation with Sod.  Seems there is a chick who wants to tour the DMB shows this summer and strip at different clubs along the way.  More on that later.    PEACE.LOVE.DMB.  |11 days|

      Okay, so here's a little bit of advice for all of you out there.  First off, getting home from a party at 4am when you have to be at work at 8 isn't the best of ideas, even if you are the designated driver.  And then, volunteering to turn your 8-hour shift into a 14-hour one, well, that just transcends all levels of stupid.  And now I'm really tired, go figure.  Anyway, Grey's been posting all this great poetry and meaningful stuff on here, and here I am blabbing away.  Heh, she didn't believe me when I told her she'd be the all-star on this thing.  But, I swear, the moment I have an actual thought, it'll go up here.  In the meantime, though... mmmm, nap.  And Grey, you know I'm here for ya if ever you need me during all this.

      Saturday wasn't so good.  I did the whole funeral ceremony for my grandpa and we all went out for lunch.  Then my mom and I went to get some flowers so the kids could plant their own.  That part of the day was good, little kids planting flowers and getting into all that dirt.  Priceless.   I got a phone call from my best friend, which was very weird because at first I thought it was my cousin, she was calling from the hospital, and lately anyone calling from the hospital isn't good news.  Her mom passed away.  So I threw on some decent clothes and drove to the hospital.  She was getting ready to go back to her boyfriends, so I just met her back at his house.  This isn't so easy, dealing with the death of someone so young.  In the past 7 years I've had to see two of my uncles die, one who was only 42 and the other was 52.  I cant even begin to know how it feels to lose your dad or your mom.  I only know how it affected my cousins and my mom- losing her brother in 1998 and my dad losing his brother in 2003.     Road -- Imagine yourself in the tightest space, And you'll be here with me Staring through curtains of lace, At a mass of swirling trees It's a bumpy ride but, I'll make my way now To a place to confide, And a place where I can stay So away, go away, Out on the open road Just a place for me to go, Get away from it all The farther from home I get, The more alive I feel How could I forget the knowledge, That I am about to steal Hard to believe that, Now it's all over Slowly the sun sinks, On over into nowhere   On another note,Mo came up to me this morning and showed me a penny and said, "I'm rich."  Oh to be that young again when you think you're rich when you have pocket change.  He is also the one who says, "Let's go to the store and get some money."

         Dave Matthews Band Tinley Park, IL Tweeter Center Friday, June 18th 2004   Set   So Much To Say Anyone Seen The Bridge PnP Rapunzel Crazy, Easy When The World Ends Too Much If I Had It All Rhyme & Reason Thing Sugar Will  Where Are You Going Warehouse Joy Ride Lap Steel Intro---> Grace Is Gone Jimi Thing Grey Street Hello Again Stay (Wasting Time)  Encore  Crush  What Would You Say  ----------------------------  So you see I got to hear Warehouse and my two all time faves.  Grace is Gone and Grey Street.  The jam for GIG was freakin' awesome!  I could not stop dancing the entire time.  Little disappointed in all the 'radio songs' like So Much To Say and Where Are You Going.  And I think they could have done better with the encore instead of What Would You Say.  Coming back with Crush and Stefan-the bass God that he is- oh, perfect end to a perfect show.  If I Had It All, song off of Everyday, not that impressed, and a little slow.  The jams and dancing is what gets me going and when a slow song comes on, its just like WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?!?  How can you go from Too Much into IIHIA and then play Rhyme & Reason?  They did it though.  Shouldnt really complain, I was just happy to be there and have another great time on the lawn.  Besides the 17 year old boy and his girlfriend who got taken away by ATF and the 21 year old girls next to us for buying alcohol for minors and the guy behind us who threw up on our blanket AND the girl who pissed behind us, Tweeter rocked.  Dave's Skat was memorable and everytime the camera panned over Carter, he had a huge grin on his face.  Maybe they were talking about someone in the crowd or maybe he knew he was part of the best damn band in the world and that set him in a good mood.  New songs were tight,  Crazy, Easy  and Joy Ride ,were two of my faves.  Getting the new cd will be something I'll be waiting for.  Well I need to go post on Nancies that I need to do a B&P for last nights show.   Peace. Love.DMB.    |360 some odd days till next summers show.|    Holla.

One drink to remember, and another to forget...   Surrounded by 40,000 people, I've never felt so alone.

      145 minutes to go until the curtain comes up (well, if there was a curtain.)  I can't believe it's finally here.  I've found myself nervous and pacing.  The skies have clouded up, and the forecasts are calling for a cool and rainy night out on the lawn.  The blankets are in the trunk, the essential tailgating supplies are chilled in the fridge with a cooler and ice at the ready, and yes, I do have my ticket.  Better double-check on that one.  Okay, yeah, got it. 4 new songs tonight, if last night's set list is any indication.  I haven't been to a Dave show since December of '96, and I just know that the whole experience of this evening is going to blow me away and I'll be left with a stupid grin for the forseeable future.  The time to hit the road fast approaches.  140 minutes...

      Grrrr!  They did it!  They played Warehouse LAST NIGHT!  Will I get to hear it tonight?  Probably not, but here's to hoping!     Dave Matthews Band June 17, 2004 UMB Bank Pavilion Maryland Heights, MO   Set Too Much  Granny  What Would You Say  Rhyme & Reason  New Song #2  When The World Ends  I Did It  Warehouse  New Song #1  Grey Street  Crush  New Song #3  Drive In Drive Out  Lap Steel Intro --> Grace Is Gone  Help Myself  Rapunzel   Encore: Bass Intro --> New Song #4  Stay   --------------------- They also played Granny, which is also a problem because I wanted to hear that.  Grey Street and GIG--I cant even IMAGINE what they will play tonight.  WOW, looking at this set list makes me frown.  I should have been in  MO last night for this.  Now I know that every set list I read, shows other than tonight, will rear the green monster.  No reviews have been posted yet about last nights show, so I cant include them in this post.  Enough Dave Speak till tomorrow when I can give you first hand the euphoria I feel. =)  Class last night was OK.  Took a quiz, like always.  Considering I only read half the chapter, I did pretty good on the quiz.  Passed it at least.  Lecture was pretty boring, but looking in those dreamy eyes......WAKE UP GREY!  Got out at a decent time and went to the grocery to pick up beer, and other drinks, and food that shouldn't be consumed unless you are tailgating before a show where you aren't even 'allowed' to tailgate.  To this I say: Show me the handcuffs.  The fuzzy kind preferred.  So I get home and  trouble and get me behind me now  are still awake....heh.  Tried to talk Sokie into taking a shower, but she wanted a bath with the purple soap.  So here I am, giving kids a bath at 9:45, an hour and 45 minutes PAST their bedtime and so far everything is going well.  Time to let the water out.  OH NO. Shit hits the fan.  "It is WAY past your bedtime, and morning comes early around here"  Yeah, I know, mom's words of wisdom.  I CAN control this.  Sleep comes fast for tired girls and boys and by this time all I want to do is sleep.  Phone rings and I pick it up and hear someone singing the lyrics to 'Should Have Been A Cowboy' by Toby Keith.  Whenever I hear that song, I only think of one person, and the person I think of happened to be the person serenading me over the phone.  Superfly!  Done with pool leagues wants to go to The Bar.  Twist my arm, I haven't been down there for awhile now and I miss the action, ie. BOYS!  Talking to Sod on the tele while I drive around the bend in the river, I get closer to one of the parking lots, and this place is packed.  Domers  should  be home!  This cant all be townies, can it?  Yes, it can.  Finally get past Andy, the one AND only bouncer who carded me up until about two months ago.  Why cant guys remember anything?  Not like its my first time, and not like I don't hang out with about 10 of the regulars.  Oh well, he knew me last night and I felt goooooood.  $1 pints, hell of a lot better than $9 beers I'll be sipping tonight.  Crowded back patio, nice to rub....eh, nevermind.  Ran into this guy we went to high school with and do the "Hey, How are ya's"....but wait, he says. "You have a tongue ring?". No, I say, lying.  Suddenly an arm goes around my back and its all fun in games.  Stud in the tongue = no effort to pick up guys.  Not my type, but good times.  Ended up back inside, sitting around the pool table watching four guys, two teams of....two, TRY and shoot pool.  This game was taking FOREVER.  I am so used to watching people who can shoot pool in only a few innings.  These guys were so sloppy also.  One of these days I'm going to play and make some people smile.  1AM rolls around and the music isn't making me move anymore.  What is a girl to do?  Walk on over to the jukebox and let the machine suck money out of my hand.  I've been on this Ben Harper kick, because I cant listen to DMB at the moment, so I play  Gold To Me .  Not only do I love the song, but it reminds me of someone and then all is good.  Superfly doesn't know much Ben so I'm singing to her and this guy with a Cubs hat, and Puma shoes comes walking by and IS SINGING THE SONG.  He is singing a Ben Harper song!  Now, it might not mean so much to you, but around here the radio stations do not even play good music.  NO dave, NO ben, NO jack, NO nothing good in the eyes of real people liking REAL music.  This I know, he has the album!  Obviously the $1 pints got to him a little sooner than myself, and its all about the smiles!  When a guy smiles, it makes me melt.  What an awesome night.  Dancing in a bar that isn't a 'dance bar', you kind of stick out, but when its good tunes, nothing else matters.  Song ends and Cub hat boy and I end up in deep conversations about how cool I am that I get to see DMB tomorrow, and how cool I am because I know the Cubs just swept the Astros and how cool I am because....well, you get the picture.  "What time does Taco Bell close?"  Superfly wants to eat.  She has to eat after drinking.  I tend to sit there and stare at her while she eats.  Alcohol and eating don't mix with me.  But tonight, tacos sound okie dokie by me.  She hasn't been to her apt. in two weeks, taking care of her man who fell at work.  Long story-no time for that now.  Pick up grease in a shell and head over to her place.  Looking at my watch, 3:15am.  Sleep sounds so good.  I'm glad I only have a 7 minute drive back to my house.  Crawl into bed, laying with my head at the foot end and only a t shirt..............   PEACE.LOVE.DMB   | 10 Hours! |

      Cathin' on eh.  I cant obviously be creative enough to think of my own titles, so I choose song titles and then try to incorporate the lyrics into the post.  I think I can do it here.  This song rocks!  I put it on the day I got it and Sophia had her  urlLink funky glasses  on and just started dancing like crazy.  Like those girls you see on the lawn at live shows.  Where the music just kicks ass and you cant do anything but move your body.  I didn't even tell her to dance, she just did it.  That's how I know she has it. She has the rhythm.  She knows where I'm going tomorrow, and she isn't happy.  She wants to go so bad, its unreal.  4 years old!  I plan on taking her next summer.  Sophia will only be 5 next summer, but if dmb would break up before she would get a chance, I would feel bad that she didn't get a chance to experience something like that.  At 5 I think she'll remember forever.  My plan is to take her one night and take Mo on a different night.  Should be a great summer.  Ugh, am I already thinking about next summer?    This morning I got a lot of hairs cut.  It was insane.  All that red hair all over the floor.  Feels much better, much cooler and, like I said it will all grow back soon enough.    I will go to class tonight and take a quiz, like every Thursday.  Except I am resorting back to the  'No Pants Thursday'  rule.  How can I make that ole' boy notice me?! HA!  Then I guess I should go to the store and pick up some stuff for the tailgating thang tomorrow evening.  Which reminds me- 1 more day!  The wait is unbearable.  There will be a review up sometime before I leave tomorrow on the show from tonight in MO.  Till then, I gots to bounce.

      Yep, two days!  It's finally going to happen.  A year is too long to wait to see those boys.  And if you know 'anything', the title of this post isn't even their song.  Crazy me.   I got  Fight For Your Mind  from Sap in the mail last week.  What a wonderful CD.  I knew it would be, Ben Harper is amazing.  The only thing about Ben is, he reminds me of this guy I dated last summer.  He got me into Ben and everytime I hear some Harper, I think of this guy.  Not that I want to be with him again, but it just makes me think about how cool he was and how I've met someone almost exactly like him.  The only thing that they don't have in common is their age.  More often then not, music reminds me of good times I've had with good friends, which is why this Friday is what I've been needing the past few weeks.  Even though most of my friends don't even like DMB, each and every song means something to me, not in the 'girlie way', but just that music is music and you either feel it or you don't.    Its either love or hate, I can't find in between  ---------------------------------------------------------------- If you've been reading every post and following my 'blog addiction' comments, you have to hear this.  Recently I came across  urlLink this blog  about this chick teasing her boyfriend, I mean, she blogs about other stuff as well, but the title makes you assume she's all about the teasing.  Now, if I were smart, I would have started a blog about this, but then again, I have no one at the moment I am teasing.  This also makes me think about all the guys who read her blog and what they must be thinking about(not making this up, I've read some of the comments). Then, of course I check back to the  urlLink sexaholics  blog and he posted 20 questions, and if  you answer yes to any of these, you may have a problem.   I will not say how many I answered yes to, if I did at all.  All I know is, if I'm a Lion, I need some meat!   Wish there was something I, could say or do I can resist anything but, the temptation from you   I told Sod I was going to blog about 'that kind of stuff', stuff like the tease blogs about, but I don't think it will help in my 12-step program.  I can already hear the word relapse in my mind.  As of right now, Grey has 0% self control.   ------------------------------------------------------ Rain?!?  This is not good. Kids wanted to go to the water park again today.  I guess it really isnt a 'water park'.  Just a cement circle in the middle of a lawn that has high powered water sprinklers. Yes, I have water babies.  Sophia especially.  She cant stay away from water.  If this means filling up cotton ball bags, giving her barbies a bath, or just sitting in a sandbox/mudbox one Saturday afternoon. It even includes walking  this close  to the edge of the pool.  Keeps me on my toes!      PEACE.LOVE.DMB.   |2 days!|

      Gee, I can't believe I titled this post like that.  I'm not even from Detroit.  Anywho, yep, they did it!  I will not make any rude and nasty comments about Kobe and the freakin' Lakers tonight.  Having the Pistons beat them  100-87  is good enough for me.  Basketball is over, now I can concentrate on the Cubbies.  They won again tonight by the way.  Movin' on up!  Down 2 games. It's still a little early to be worried about series position, so I won't have that competition edge to me for a few weeks.  Although Wimbledon starts Monday.  Woooooo. No.  No matter how hot Andy Roddick is, I wont go there.

      You know, in the rush to attempt major accomplishments, with deadlines for projects seemingly lurking around every corner, it's good to sit back and appreciate the little things in life.  Last night, Grey and I were talking about how we had both fallen out of the habit of watching The Real World: San Diego on a weekly basis.  And with a show like that, you miss a week, you find yourself out of the loop on things, your interest starts to fade, and suddenly Tuesday at 9 isn't the appointment it used to be.  We both agreed that we'd just have to keep our eyes out for a marathon and catch up then.  So I get home, flip on the tube, and lo and behold, what's on?  Why, a Real World marathon, naturally.  Time to pop in the tape and let it roll.  I'm away from the homestead right now, but it's good to know it'll be waiting for me when I get home, so I can finally catch up on all the skanky details.  At work today, as is sometimes the case, we came across a damaged item that looked tasty.  Today's featured delicacy: gummi peaches.  I've had an inexplicable craving for peaches the past few days *ahem*, and while this wasn't the genuine article, it satisfied my need for the time being.  As far as rankings go in the realm of all things gummi, these bad boys are pretty high up on the list.  About a week ago, I posted a lengthy rant on here about the sorry state of music radio in Chicago.  Well, today, a  new radio station  popped up on the dial that shows all kinds of promise.  When you put on a station that plays, one after the other, Smashing Pumpkins, The Go-Go's, Queens of the Stone Age, and Led Zeppelin, well, at the very least, it's different from anything else out there right now, and it seems like it holds a bunch of potential for something really good.  I'll be listening.  Well, that's it for now.  Big game tonight.  Go, Team That Is Not The Lakers!

      Okay, I'm sure I've made it fairly obvious up to this point that I am, in most respects, a dork.  But it can be argued, quite successfully, that I was an even bigger dork in my younger days.  From 8th Grade through Junior year of high school, I wore braces.  And then for 6 joyous years after that, I was stuck with a retainer.  And though there's no longer anything hard-wired into my mouth, every so often I can feel things shifting, so I have to pop the metal top retainer and a plastic molded lower one back in for a day or two.  Today was one such joyous occasion.  And so, I once again look like the Math Club nerd that I truly am, with the bonus perks of having my teeth hurt like hell and sporting a lovely speech impediment from not being used to having this stuff in my mouth.  Blah.  To think my parents shelled out $3K for this... well I guess it is better than how my teeth looked before I got hooked up with the hardware.  That smile could have given Jewel a run for her money.  Eep.  And from the realm of "truly bad news," here's a nugget pulled straight from the website of Tweeter Center Chicago (it's still The World, dammit):    Tailgating and drinking are not permitted in Tweeter Center parking lots, per a Village of Tinley Park ordinance. A wide variety of food and beverages are available inside the Tweeter Center before and during every performance.    Well, so much for that grand idea.  Looks like the options go back to either hanging out at my house before the show and drinking cheap/free, or trying to catch a buzz off of the $9 beer at The World, which I think can be nominated for WORST IDEA EVER.  If I have to shell out $9.00 for a single beer (and fecking Coors, no less!), then I'll just settle for the contact high I'm bound to get from sitting on the lawn.  And if there's no pre-show drinky over at my house, then what shall become of the Woodchucks?  I don't want to drink them alone - that's a special occasion beverage.  Maybe I can just save them for the next time Grey has a free moment on a weekend.  But I don't know if they'll still be fresh by the time 2007 rolls around.

       Few articles about this past weekend.   No, Rain   Manchester, TN- Despite three inches of rain on Saturday, eventually the advertised performers did indeed play. Thunderstorms caused a number of delays but eventually the billed artists took the stage, including Steve Winwood who had some water-related equipment problems that nearly cancelled his set.    Warren Haynes, Kingaroo   Warren Haynes, whose Live at Bonnaroo came out last week, performed multiple times over the course of the weekend. On Friday he joined Chris Robinson and New Earth Mud for “Got Love If You Want It.” Then on Saturday he appeared on the main stage on two separate occasions over three sets, the first with Gov’t Mule and the later two with the Dead.   Adrian Belew Sits in With Primus   Manchester-TN, Primus performed the only late-night outdoor set of the festival, appearing on the Which Stage around 1AM on Sunday morning. This setting proved apt for the band and its production elements, which included a series of orb screens behind the group. Late in the group’s set Primus invited King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew out for a version of that group’s “Thela Hun Ginjeet.”   William Hung: Bonnaroo Grand Marshall   Manchester, TN- The second annual Bonnaroo Mardi Gras parade took place on Friday night (technically Saturday morning) with a special, curious guest of honor. William Hung, the American Idol cast off appeared as the Grand Marshall. Hung delivered flat, off-key versions of a few songs including “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” and ”She Bangs.” No word as to whether this was intended as a commentary on the vocal quality of performers within this scene.   The Inverted Umphrey's>moe. Switch   Manchester, TN- Two months ago in Las Vegas, Umphrey’ McGee emerged during moe.’s set. On Friday night moe. returned the favor, appearing mid-way through Umphrey’s McGee’s late night performance at the Other Tent. The members of the quartet emerged one at a time during a jam that developed out of “Triple Wide” and remained on stage for “Recreational Chemistry” and “Brent Black” (the latter song also featured String cheese Incident drummer Michael Travis who was cajoled out of the audience by moe.’s Rob Derhak). Then the group brought out Umphrey’s manager Vince Iwinski for a version of “Enter Sandman” with Iwinski looking particularly Hetfieldesque. Following the song, Umphreys’s returned and kept the metal momentum going with a take on “And Justice For All.”

      Ah, inventory.  I feel so used.  It was sad and a bit scary to see so many familiar faces from the hellhole of a job I left over a year and a half ago.  That place, it sucks your brain clean out of your ear and makes you part of it if you're not careful.  I was one of the fortunate ones who got out and lived to tell about it.  Honestly, as I spent the evening doing pre-counts and re-counts amidst the incessant beeps and buzzes of the audit machines that surrounded me, it all came back.  See, in order to be a successful and efficient counter, part of you has to disconnect.  Certain areas of your brain just shut down - suddenly it's just your eyes, your fingers, and the merchandise in front of you as the numbers roll along in your head as if on a mental odometer.  It basically shuts down a good portion of your ability to function as a human being, and increases exponentially your ability to function as an abacus.  If you've never done it and felt it, then my words probably don't begin to explain the phenomenon.  But, trust me, once you do it and are conscious of what is taking place, it freaks you out.  On a lighter note, I have a bit of a tradition called Quotes of the Week.  I just know too many people who are constantly saying hilarious stuff, and so I feel the need to recap the cream of the crop at the end of each week and share it with those who may have missed out the first time around.  And now, it's time to share it with any and all potential blog perusers.  Here goes:  Quotes of the Week:  "Did a guy ever say to you, 'I'll make an honest woman out of you?'  Just wondering."                                   --Katrina, inquiring about Erica's college days  "I'm so excited I could shit myself!"                               --Jen, upon hearing about "I Love the '90s"  "I do enjoy the woody goodness every now and then."                                                --Jaymie  Conversation of the Week:  Matt: "Were you drinking wine tonight?" Me:   "Yeah, I broiled some salmon, had a baked potato, green beans, and some        white wine to go with it." Matt: "Aww, you had a nice romantic dinner with yourself." Me:   "Yep.  And then I masturbated."  And there you have it.  A tiny window into the kaleidoscope of weirdness that makes up an average week.  Some people have told me I'm living in a sitcom.  To that I say, get me some canned laughter, a catchy theme song, and a sucker of a network executive to push a 7-figure contract in front of me, and I'm all over it.

      Poor Kobe.  Ba Ha Ha Ha!  Sorry, had to.  Shouldn't celebrate too early though, they could come back and beat the Pistons.  Coming back from this isn't going to be easy.  Back to LA for games 5 and maybe game 6.  Tuesday nights post might be full of 'yey pistons', but I doubt it.  Like Sod said, I want the Lakers to lose more than I want the Pistons to win.    Superfly won!  Vegas looks good on me!  Uh, yeah.  You know what I mean.  Hot August heat, slot machines and free liquor.  What more could a Midwestern girl need?  I'll tell you what more....well, no.  I cant do that.  But it  might  involve Tequila, lemons and  BTCS .  Maybe some  Crash  and  R2T.     So joys- Went to Target to pick up a few things, and of course she thinks she needs to get something every time we go.  "I need this Barbie." "No, you don't."  "Mo needs this car."  "Yes, Mommy needs to get Mo something for your birthday."  See, I never thought of it before, but I always say "your birthday", I mean, it is, 'their birthday', but it's also 'her birthday' and 'his birthday', I always go back to 'your birthday'.  Wow, I just confused myself.  After all that present talk, someone said they had to use the restroom.  Got half way there, no one has to use the restroom.  But this someone decides that since she isn't getting anything, that she'll just lay down on the floor at Target and start screaming, then proceed to yell that she cant get up.  I felt like I was in that commercial where the old lady can't get up.  Instead of letting the entire store hear my daughters beautiful voice, I went over to her and got her up.  Everything was fine after that, like nothing happened.  She is good at that.  One minute it's total drama, the next is if nothing happened and it's just a great day.  I tell ya.  I didn't have Mo with me, he went with Grandma.  Its good for them to spend time apart.  Dinner @ this really classy place where they already have the wine glasses on the table, which got fingered and violated right away when we sat down.  "Please don't mess with the glasses."  "I WANNA SIT BY YOU MOM!"  Great to be Mom.  Dinner was great though.  Good food.  Told Sophia that we would probably go somewhere else for ice cream.  So when the waitress came and asked if anyone wanted dessert, she told her we were going somewhere else.  Guess you had to be there.  It was cute.      Why can't I get just one kiss? Why can't I get just one kiss? Believe me,  Somethings I wouldn't miss But I look at you pants and I need a kiss.  Why can't I get just one screw? Why can't I get just one screw? Believe me, I'd know what to do. But something won't let me make love to you.  Why can't I get just one fuck? Why can't I get just one fuck? I guess it's got something to do with luck But I've waited my whole life for just one  Day after day I get angry And I will say That the day is in my sight When I take a bow and say goodnight  Oh my my my my my oh my mum Have you kept your eye Your eye on your son? I know you've had problems You're not the only one When your sugar left, he left you on the run  Mo my my my my my mo my mum Take a look now Look what your boy has done He's walking around like he's number one You went downtown and got him a gun.  Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me You know you got my sympathy But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me You know you got my sympathy But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me   Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs Can I mix in with your affairs? Share a smoke, Make a joke Grasp and reach for a leg of hope Words to memorize, words hypnotize Words make my mouth exercise. Words all fail the magic prize Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs  Oh my my my my my mo my mother I would love to love you lover City's restless It's ready to pounce Here in your bed from ounce to ounce Sayin' oh my my my my my mo my mother I would love to love you lover The city's restless It's ready to pounce Here in your bed from ounce to ounce  I've given you a decision to make Things to lose, things to take Just as she's about ready to cut it up She says Wait a minute honey I'm gonna add it up Add it up (x8) Day after day I get angry and I will say That the day is in my sight When I take a bow and say goodnight   So sings this song and it's a riot.    Peace.Love.DMB.   |5 days|

      So, the Sox lost today, 7-4, but they played a whole lot worse than the score would indicate.  For those of you not in the know, Grey's a huge Cubs fan, I'm  a lifelong Sox fan, and the two teams are renewing the annual interleague rivalry this weekend and next.  Since they started playing interleague games in '97, this is the first time the teams have met with both of them owning winning records.  Both teams are within sniffing distance of first place... and God, the Sox have no pitching.  Starting tomorrow is some guy I think they picked up off of the back of a turnip truck.  I've never heard of him before, ever.  It looks like I'm going to be owing Grey a drink by the end of this weekend.  Speaking of drinks, Erica's send-off was one done in high style.  20 assorted people (co-workers, former workers, and random significant others) ended up making an appearance.  It was like old times, when I first was introduced to the Thursday Night Tradition.  Every Thursday, out we'd go to this hole-in-the-wall Irish pub, at least a dozen of us and oftentimes more.  But people started leaving, and the new people that came in... well, they're fun to be around at work, but so many of them are either married or damn close to it, so they're all about hanging with their life partner, not going out boozing after midnight with the likes of us.  Now we're lucky to field a gang of 6 on a Thursday.  Sad, really.  But hey, maybe this past Thursday is the sort of evening that will remind people how much fun they can have out with us, and maybe it'll lead to future crowds around that long table.  Here's hoping.  Homelife... is strange.  I pull up to the house now, and I get the feeling like there's a giant banner out front that reads "You're Not Welcome Here!"  I mean, this is still my home, technically, isn't it?  And yet I walk around here feeling like a houseguest who has woefully overstayed his welcome.  I want to spend as little time here each day as I have to, and I know feeling like that about one's home can't be good for me.  I can only hope that there will be someplace new I can call home in the very near future.

      Oh man, this title is outta this world.  I am losing my mind!  What I get working on about 10 hours of sleep in the past 48.  And tonight wont get me anymore hours.  Tomorrow night either.  I suck.  Anyway, this is my post for today, and I wont be around for a few days.  Try not to miss my exciting adventures.  Just know I will be having fun without you!     Is DMB a chick or guy band?      The reason I think it may appeal to more woman than men as someone previously mentioned (51% to 49%) is that the members of DMB seem to hold their female fanbase in a higher regard than other rock bands.  Meaning that they don't treat them like sex objects or as a butt of jokes.  There don't seem to be many DMB "groupies" in the traditional sense of the word. Maybe this has something to do with it.  --Beatlesfan    -post on  urlLink nancies.    51% women and 49% men.  Lucky guys.  Gotta eat. Gotta run. Gotta live.   Peace.Love.DMB.

They are improving their shit.  Starting to remember where it all came from.  Is Leroi really afraid to play Let You Down?  Meh!  Am I really thinking of camping @ Deer Creek next summer and going to both nights?!?  I really, really want to.  At least I know they wont play the same songs both nights.  Commenting on the set lists  is getting me down my love, like a cat in the bag, waiting to drown, this time Im coming down.   It seems like I'm just saying the same stuff over and over.  Ah yes, where are they next....lets see.... Sat 6/26  Post-Gazette Pavilion  Burgettstown, PA.     Tomorrow is the big night.  Superflys birthday shin dig.  She called me today and asked if I would drive her.  I guess I should be the dd since she drove me around on my birthday, wait, no she didn't, she got sloppy drunk with me!!  I think my cousin drove me home.  I'll be ok, gotta take care of my pals.  Besides, getting drunk and trying to have a decent conversation with 'the date', might not be too impressive.  I gotta stop thinking about it, I am over analyzing the situation and that's no good.  I still have 3 weeks of class left.  Nothing is going to happen. What is going to happen is, I am going to head off to dream land.  And yes, once again, PISS ON THE CARDS!    GO CUBBIES!!   Peace.Love.DMB.

      The word has come down from on high, by which I mean from my landlord: I've got no right to stay here.  She told me that her agreement was exclusively with my roommate, and that as far as she was concerned, I was staying here under his invitation, as a way to split the costs.  And so, I've lost.  By September 18th, I will need to find a new job, a new home, and new stuff.  But, this too shall pass.  And I'll probably be better off for the experience in the end.  I'm not going to fight, because there's no reason.  I'm not going to be vengeful or bitter toward my roommate, either, because that would accomplish nothing other than making this whole experience even more difficult for me.  However, I think Grey's idea of having a blowout "Fuck You" party right before I leave is a grand one.  Yeah, that'll have to happen.  Matt must be feeling at least a slight twinge of guilt about the situation.  He took me out for dinner tonight at Applebee's.  Word of advice: stay away from the riblets.  Not boneless.  Tasty, but a pain in the ass to eat.  Might as well just go for the ribs.  Tonight is Erica's last night at work.  And we're all making sure she goes out in style.  A big drinking night and dancing at the worst club ever until 4 in the morning looms in the near future.  It's gonna be some good times.

      No  urlLink DMB set list  to show you today.  Boys headed to Ohio for a show tonight.  I feel like I don't have anything to blog about this morning. Oh wait, YES I DO!  I don't want to sound overly excited about it.  I'm not in high school anymore, but for some reason, this makes me all happy and I have that warm, fuzzy feeling.  Hardly.  As it turns out, I will not be attending the Phish show Friday night.  :-(   Its horrible, I know, but things come up and other plans happen and then you're stuck with feelings of guilt.  Phish is a great band, but the need to go just isn't the same as other things that a girl wants, and needs.  I was telling my friend last night about the band that a bunch of us are going to see Friday night, and my psychology teacher heard this conversation.  Guess he likes the band, and it turned out that he wants to go-and meet me there.  So it isn't a 'date', but he knows I am going and said we should meet up at the show.  Besides all that, the band,  urlLink 2Northwest  is awesome and it should prove to be a good night.  Superflys birthday is Saturday, and this will be the night we celebrate.  I just might take my dads' digital and get some pics.  Ohhh, I should do that.  Would be good to snap some shots of drunken superflys and greys.  OK, so my blogging mind is going to sleep and this doesn't feel right.  Till next time....   Peace.Love.DMB.

      Well, it's been, to say the least, an eventful stretch of days, and not necessarily altogether positive.  Monday afternoon, my roommate approaches me.  "Later tonight, can we talk?  I just need to sort out some bills and stuff with you."  Okay, I think, wondering what it could be about, considering that I had just paid the rent and my half of the utilities that morning.  So, having had dinner at my parents' house, I come home.  "Sit down," he practically commands.  I know this isn't good already.  He's assuming his teaching posture, trying to coerce me into being the subservient student.  He then explains to me, calmly and rationally: I have to leave.  Oh, I haven't done anything wrong; I've pretty much been an ideal roommate, he explains.  But he's realized that over the past 11 months, which according to him, have been "terrible" (which is funny, because his aggravation never manifested itself outwardly,) he's realized that he is incapable of living someplace with another person.  I have until September 18th to completely remove myself from the premises.  Of course, he tells me that he's only doing this because living with me any longer would drive him nuts and seriously damage our friendship.  And I think to myself,  Gee pal, haven't you just totally screwed our friendship by kicking my ass to the curb for no good reason?   Completely blindsided by this (I mean there were no signs of any problems,  none ,) I'm dumbstruck and have to leave the house to collect my thoughts, to try and make some bit of sense out of this and figure out what in the hell I'm going to do.  See, what my roommate has just told me, in essence, is that since he has a problem which is his fault and his alone, I have to find a new place to live, find new furnishings and other essentials and fill it, and find a new job to pay for it all.  Meanwhile, he'll just stay where he is and not alter a single aspect of his existence, thank you very much.  Driving aimlessly, not exactly sure where I am, I get a call from my friend Brittney.  She's just calling to tell me that she's moved, and now lives only a mile away from me.  Clip and save that, folks.  There's true irony for you right there.    So we meet up, talk about stuff and things, and then head over to this really nice hall in my neck of the woods to shoot pool.  That Brittney, she's something else.  18, working full-time in a porn store, going to school, and smoking like a fiend, to the point where she's bought a digital watch with a built-in lighter on the face.  She's so sweet and so much fun to be around, though.  After we finish shooting pool for the night, she insists on playing  Dance Dance Revolution .  Not necessarily the best of ideas for a girl with a pack-a-day habit and an out-of-shape 25-year-old.  It was goofy as hell and fun though, and we gave eachother a big hug and went on our respective ways, sweaty and winded.  Tuesday night... ah, the joy of half-price night at Comiskey Park.  And no, I don't care who's sponsoring the stadium these days; the home of the White Sox will always be Comiskey to me.  Head over to my friend Nick's for some pre-game libations, meet up with B and his girlfriend, and drive up to the park.  Do a little tailgating in the parking lot, and then into the park, our $6 seats giving up a fine view of things from the remodeled upper deck.  People can piss and moan about that park all they want; It's still a first-class facility and a great place to catch a game.  Having had a few before the game and intending on a few more after, it's easy to pass by the $5.50 beers the vendors are pushing.  The all-beef jumbo Kosher dog, though, that's coming my way.  And for that matter, so is the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and hot giardeniera.  Mmmm, that's good eatin'.  The Sox blow away Cleveland early, it's 8-0 by the end of 3.  But in true Sox fashion, next thing I know, it's Cleveland with a 9-8 edge.  That pitching staff makes me start looking around for a cyanide capsule every time I watch a game.  They tie it up, and it heads to extra innings.  Jose Valentin, a player so emblematic of all things White Sox (he's either saving the day like an all-star, or striking out 4 times and making 2 errors in the field, with no middle ground,) belts one out in the bottom of the 10th.  Fireworks pop like mad, Sox win 11-9, now 1 game in back of Minnesota for the division lead.  Being half price night as it was, the upper deck was pretty much like the lawn at a concert.  Heavy drinking and smoking all around, and certainly not just cigarettes by any means.  At one point a cloud rose up from the other side of the upper deck that looked like something out of a Cheech and Chong movie.  Ah, you can't beat fun at the old ballpark.  In front of us, there was a wide assortment, with one particularly loud jackass continually looking over at the out-of-town scores.  Finally, he let go with a "WOOOOOOOOO!  CUBBIES!" that was cheerfully met by far too many people in our section.  For all the bad publicity Sox fans have received in recent years, it should be noted that every drunken jackass who's run out onto the field and tried to attack someone has been, in fact, a Cubs fan.  Anyway, after the game, it's back to Nick's and it's time to get hot - in the hot tub!  Damn, so relaxing. the jets working up and down my back in the warm water while we all sip our ice-cold bottles of Miller Lite.  Probably spent way too long in there as we were all pruned up pretty badly by the time we got out around 2, but who cares?  I tfelt fantastic, and it'll probably be the thing to do come July 6, the next half-price Tuesday.  On the "homework assignment" front from flirty girl, I wrote one and kept it short and to the point, as she requested.  650 words, and it got me some positive feedback.  Grey just rolled with it, ended up with 5 pages, and oh my God.  Made me realize that i have to, and this isn't intentionally a bad pun, "flesh out" my story.  Add all the little details that I'd want to experience in real life.  So, yeah, I'll be writing the "director's cut" between now and tomorrow.  As for the roommate situation, I've been talking to a lot of friends (and I really am lucky to have so many good friends,) and there seems to be a consensus:  He's got a problem living with people, I've done nothing wrong, then it's all on him to move out and find his own place.  Can't wait to break the news to him that it's his responsibility to move, and I have no intentions of going everywhere.  That oughta make the living situation interesting.  Until next time...

        Dave Matthews Band Monday  June 21 2004   Deer Creek   Indianapolis, Indiana Verizon Wireless Music Center  Set  Don't Drink the Water One Sweet World Best of What's Around Hello Again Recently The Space Between Tripping Billies Sugar Will Drive In Drive Out Crush Joy Ride I Did It Jimi Thing Crazy Easy Stay Encore: If I Had It All Ants Marching   Better night with some DDTW and One Sweet World.  BOWA would have been kick ass to hear Friday night.  I guess a lot of people have been complaining about the set list so far.  It has been repetitive, but Im glad they didn't play the same songs at the same venue in two nights.  I think people would have thrown shit.    I found out today that Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan are going to play at the minor league baseball field here in South Bend, late August.  Setting up the stage in Center Field.  You can take blankets and sit in the outfield.  Un-FUCKING-believable.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday and you bet your sweet ass I will be in line to get tickets.  I am not passing this one up.  Wille and Bob...god damn.    This morning I found out someone broke into my car.  Busted out the rear vent window and unlocked the door.  Someone with a long arm, I couldn't even reach in to unlock the door.  They went through my cds and took all my silver change.  About $4.00, but its still the principle.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind breaking into someone's car and thinking it is ok.  So now I have to get the window replaced and thank god they didn't steal any of my Dave CDs.   Grey would have been pissy!!   I wrote 'the story', so if you want to read it, let me know and I'll email it.  I will send it off and see what tCj thinks by Friday.  I've just wanted to get some opinions and 'advice', if you will.  I think I have gotten a lot of good ideas and to those who have helped-Thank You!  OK, I need to crash out, class tonight.  Quiz, oh Quiz.     Peace.Love.DMB.

       Dave Matthews Band Deer Creek Indianapolis, IN Sunday, June 20, 2004  Set  Warehouse  Granny  Grey Street  New Song #1  So Much To Say  Too Much  New Song #4  When The World Ends  Lap Steel Intro  Grace Is Gone  Fool To Think  Rhyme & Reason  Hmm ? [New]  New Song #2  Where Are You Going  Help Myself  New Song #3  Everyday   __________________   What Would You Say  Rapunzel      Words, words, words, can't even EXPLAIN WHY this band would play 15 of the same songs they played Friday night in Tinley Park.  All day Sunday I was feeling like just getting into my car and driving down to Indy, but I'm damn glad I stayed home and spent the rest of the day with my dad.  Could you imagine hearing almost every song again?  I can't even begin to understand why they are doing this.  I've read things that people post on Nancies about DMB playing the same songs, but 15 out of 19 is just wrong.  Especially since almost every other song they played Friday and Saturday, came off of Everyday.  What gives?  Not for me to answer.  Just that I'd hate to be that guy who went to the Maryland Heights Show, the Tweeter Show and both nights of Deer Creek(verizon wireless) in Indianapolis.  Hope he had tons of money for liquor to take away the pain.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE DMB, but not changing it up a little, when you have a TON of awesome songs, is quite disappointing.  Now I am even more excited to see the set list from the Monday night show-tonight's show-they betta Rock The House!  Speaking of Rocking The House, I've decided that Dave should show up here, with the band, and play in my back yard.  I wouldn't be greedy, I would tell my close friends and family and it would be a nice little gathering.  Then I would proceed to suggest the set list for the first night, because Dave would be spending the night, and it would be like this...  One Sweet World Granny Warehouse *sigh* Grace Is Gone Grey Street *sigh* Dancing Nancies The Dreaming Tree Halloween *sigh*(i don't care how shot his voice is) Ants Say Goodbye Gold To Me (cover) Tangerine (cover) Don't Drink The Water (for sokie) Bartender Pay For What You Get The Maker  Encore with Crush and Too Much OR Crash Into Me and The Song That Jane Likes OR a long version of Seek Up and Two Step.  Then on the second night they can just give me stuff like WWYS, and Lover Lay Down, and Satellite....  My natural high would last into the night and definitely the next 10 YEARS!  I want my ring tone to be customized by Stefan with a special intro to Crush. Damn that boy!    Fathers Day. My dad was in Chicago this weekend for a bachelor party.  Going to a Cubs game for your bachelor party, then spending the rest of the night going from bar to bar in downtown Chicago.  What a deal!!!  That would be my ideal bachelorette party, add some smokin' hotties and it would be complete.  {aka cowboys!}  Anyway, my dad showed up at my grandma's in the afternoon and we spent the rest of the day together.  Ate way too much meat.  Pork roast and then later I had BBQ.  My mom made the best pork roast and potatoes and carrots.  Mmmmmm.  I wish I could have some now.  My brother and his family were there also, but then my brother had to leave and go to work.  It's always good seeing my brother twice in three days.  I think I'm going to see him again this weekend.    Thinking about going up to Wisconsin to see Phish on Friday night, then coming home early Saturday morning for a garage sale, lunch with Superfly for her birthday and then onto my cousins going away party.  Sunday will be her going away party for the family.  Oops, I've said too much about my personal life.  Talk about personal, I think the next time I get laid, I will post about it.  Hell, I might even make something up.  I really need to start writing steamy sex stories.  But I wouldn't want people to think I was that kind of girl.  Ha Ha.  My stories would start all romantic and end with so much kink, even I would have to stop and head straight to bed. "This girl is getting laid, and masturbates more than I do"  eh?  I agree.  If I was getting some, I would only get myself off for entertainment purposes only.  Oh my.  I will get to work on something soon and link a page to it.  Right now I have to burn a cd and download the new songs from this tour.  Holla.   Peace. Love. DMB.

      When I last left you, I was heading out to go see Fahrenheit 9/11.  When I got to the movie house, he was waiting, sitting in his car.  The parking lot was packed.  I had a hard time finding him, but thank god for cell phones.  So we say the usual hellos and go buy our tickets.  More good conversation and the movie, well, the movie just made me scared for the future of America.  Not just because Michael Moore portrayed Bush as a dumbass, but I don't think any person can handle that much power of running a country.  Big heads start to show and the hunger for money builds up.  I won't give too much detail, everyone should see this flick before November-for whatever reason.  My dad doesn't want to see it, I told him he has to.  He thinks Kerry will raise our taxes.  "But Dad", I said,"Just go see the movie."  'I don't like the guy' he tells me.(meaning Michael Moore)"  Because of  Bowling for Columbine .  My dad, oy.  I cant disclose that kind of information, but don't ever try and take his right away to bear arms.     urlLink Article [IV.]   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   don't come messing with his daughter either!  =)  After the movie was over, we had more discussions over some good ole' BK and I had to get home.  I think we might go to the baseball game tonight and see some fireworks, that or I'll be making cupcakes till  6 in tha mornin'.  Might be doing that anyway.  More exciting news, I WON the CONTEST!

      Yep, the Sox played some lousy ball today.  I'm hoping this series shakes out like last week's, where they stunk it up in the first game and put a beatdown on the Cubs in the next two.  Otherwise, I'll be forking out money for flaming cheese sometime in the near future.  My manager pulled me aside for a meeting today, to tell me that I didn't get the supervisor's job, which didn't surprise me in the least.  What did surprise me is the reason why.  He says that he's received lots of complaints from my co-workers that I'm too controlling, that I try to take authority that I don't actually have.  He even went so far as to obliquely compare me to an ex-supervisor, who got the nickname "Napoleon" for a lot more than her 4'11" stature.  Every time she'd be the manager on duty, she'd become bossy as hell and act like she owned the place.  For this, we all loathed her.  Is this the way I've been behaving at work, without even realizing I am doing it?  If this is the case, then jeez, why hasn't anyone told me about it?  I mean, just come up to me and say, "Hey, stop acting like such a dick" - I don't think I'm asking too much here.  It's not like I'm out trying to get off on a power trip or something - I'm not that kind of person, at least I've never thought I was.  But being told something like this, well, it's got me questioning just exactly what kind of person I am.  And now, all of a sudden, I'm feeling insecure at work.  Like people are smiling to my face but the whispers once I leave are really harsh.  I think, I hope, this is just me being paranoid.  And I hope I can change whatever it is about me that's made me into some kind of control freak at work, because that's the last thing I want to be.

      Song number 3 on disc two of Dave Matthews Band- urlLink The Gorge  cd released this week.  Along with a DVD that I just previewed.  Pretty much got into it and ended up dancing in the kitchen.  Oh well.  It's MY kitchen!!  DMB plays tonight in New York, oh how lucky they are.    On a more disturbing note, there was an article in the paper today about a woman who left her two kids in her car,ages 10 months and 3 years,with the windows just cracked, FOR 3 HOURS!  Now the court has to prove that she left them alone knowing it would harm them.  This happened in 2002, and the temperature that day was 88.  She went into a salon to get her hair done.  Gives new meaning to  Missy Elliott, get my hair did .     LOS ANGELES (July 2) - Marlon Brando, who revolutionized American acting with his Method performances in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''On the Waterfront'' and went on to create the iconic character of Don Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather,'' has died. He was 80.  Brando died at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital Thursday, attorney David J. Seeley said Friday. The cause of death was being withheld, Seeley said, noting the actor ''was a very private man.''   I got an email today from tCj telling me that she read the story and I guess she is still trying to decide who the winner will be.  It has been mentioned to me to write more, but I feel like there is only so many ways you can talk about sex.  My creative side has been dormant since high school.  Maybe its time to let it out.    peace.love.dmb.

      One last note about  Fahrenheit 9-11 :  For all of the searches and seizures now imposed upon people by federally regulated airport security, it's amazing what you're still allowed to bring on a plane.  You can't bring a nail file, manicure scissors, a pen kinfe, or anything else that is potentially pointed and sharp.  But you know what you can bring on a plane?  Up to four books of matches and two cigarette lighters.  Because, you know, there's no risk in bringing fire-starting materials on a plane.  And besides that, it's not like anyone has ever tried to light an explosive device in an airplane cabin, right?  Of course not.  That's just crazy talk.  Other stuff: The words "Have you lost weight?" always make me a happy camper.  Someone at work said those words to me earlier this week, and sure enough, I have.  I'm down to 184 pounds, which is the weight I was at when I left high school.  A year ago at this time, I was 225, which I had been for a while, and I finally decided to do something about it.  I'm almost at the point where I want to be.  It makes me feel better about myself to know that I can accomplish something like this.  Since I've been given my notice to leave, I've picked up on something.  When I've come home the past couple weeks, I find that my bedroom door is closed.  Why is Matt doing this?  The only reason I can figure out is that this makes it easier for him to pretend that I already don't live there.  If he can't see my room or my things, he can't see me, right?  Doesn't stop him from playing College Football on my PS2 four nights a week, though.  Last night, after working at the station and dinner with the fam, I was looking for a little stress relief.  It may sound odd, but what relaxes me like few other things do is pinball.  I've been playing pinball since I wasn't even tall enough to see the playfield.  I have a memory of being about 3 years old and standing on one side of the table, pushing one flipper button while my dad pushed the one on the other side.  So I went to a local place, cashed in a couple of bucks for tokens, and played away.  It's so hard to find a pinball machine these days.  A lot of arcades don't even have them any more, and those that do usually only have one or two shoved into some out-of-the-way corner.  I found myself playing on a machine with a bunch of lights burned out, and only one completely functional flipper.  Well, that's no fun.  So I blew the rest of my tokens on Skee Ball (and they had the cannon version of Skee Ball too, please tell me someone else remembers that), grabbed my driver out of the trunk, and headed out to the driving range with a small bucket of balls.  I have no delusions about my ability as a golfer: I flat-out suck at it.  I only have a driver, specifically for going out on the range.  The club is my dad's, from a set he had when he used to caddy, meaning that it's about 47 or 48 years old.  I played actual golf a few times when I was younger, and I despised it.  Mark Twain had it right: "Golf is a good walk spoiled."  I'm sure as hell not going to drop a grand on a set of clubs for myself.  So, I spent some time hitting balls around 50 yards each, rarely if ever sending them straight, occasionally whiffing entirely, but whatever, it's a good time.  And I did hit one dead-on for about 125.  The next time I interact with a golf ball, though, I'd like it to be on astroturf, with a putter, surrounded by friends and a bunch of wacky obstacles.  Now that's the essence of the sport.  Since I still had some time to kill before the 10:15 show, I did what any respectable human being doing his damnedest to avoid going home would do: I went to Target.  Man, am I going to drop a bunch of money there on Saturday.  They have a huge section of dinner plates and glasses for 50% off - guess I just figured out how I'm going to stock my new kitchen.  Plus Grey clued me in to the fact that they have the new DMB live release for under $15, so I just have to buy it, right?  (The DVD has the video for  Grace is Gone  on it.  I'm sold.)  Target being the evil, tempting place that it is though - will I be able to fight the urge to buy a pair of Pac-Man swim trunks, the greatest looking things ever?  Only time will tell.  Oh, and by the way, according to those quizzes, I'm a "Dominant" kisser and my heart is "Red".  Whatever that means.

      Okay, I've got lots of the usual fluffy foo-foo crap to write about.  But that can all wait till morning.  I just got back from seeing this film, and I wanted to post my thoughts on it as soon as possible.  Plus, Grey told me I had to.  She's so cute when she's demanding.  FIrst off, I'm not going to review the movie.  Hundreds upon thousands have already done that, and a lot of them have actually gotten paid to do so.  I'm just putting down my thoughts and impressions of the film, and writing about a few moments that don't seem to have received as much media coverage.  After the intro and the opening credits roll (and don't get me started on the 17 minutes of commercials/previews), 60-90 of the most emotionally jarring seconds I've ever experienced in a movie take place.  The screen stays pitch black the whole time, and all you do is hear.  The theater fills with the sound of the first plane crashing.  Screams, crashes, panic.  Then the second plane, the sound as immense as the first.  There's no need for images here; I can see it all in my mind, as clearly as the day it happened.  At one point, I hear a loud crash that sounds like metal sheeting hitting the ground.  Having watched the 9/11 documentary a couple years back, though, I know what the sound really is.  It's the sound of a human body hitting pavement after a 1,000-foot freefall.  Did you know that President Bush wanted to cut the base salary of soldiers?  True story.  He also wanted to cut pensions and health benefits for veterans.  Jack up the cost on their prescriptions, too.  Mind you, at the same time, he was lobbying Congress for an $87 billion increase in military spending.  Where, exactly was that money going, then, if our soldiers were now being expected to sacrifice more than their lives for our country?  Yes, Michael Moore has an agenda in this film.  He wants nothing more than to get George W. Bush out of office.  But it's not like this is a hidden agenda, is it?  He seems pretty damn open about it.  He's made this film to make his point.  And yes, he does sometimes manipulate the images to get his point across - the scene of Baghdad children playing in a schoolyard allegedly on the eve of war is a low moment in this otherwise solid film - but that's what a filmmaker is supposed to do, and Moore is incredibly adept at doing it here.  Ever since I saw the eyes of this administration wandering away from al-Qaeda and toward Iraq, I've been steadfast in my belief that these people have to go.  I didn't vote for Bush in 2000, my first presidential election, but I didn't vote for Gore either.  I couldn't stand either one, so I voted with my conscience and punched Libertarian.  I haven't seen anything out of John Kerry that has impressed me; but the idea of another four years of this frightens me so much, I've actually found myself, a staunch political moderate, being scared into voting Democratic this coming November.  This movie is perhaps the most effective way to rally the masses into feeling the way I do.  The next administration may not be much better, but I can't see how it can do any worse.  If you have not seen this movie yet, you absolutely need to see it, for reasons that go far beyond the normal entertainment value of a summer flick.  By the way, interviewing Britney Spears for her in-depth thoughts on the state of our nation?  Brilliant!

      I woke up this morning to the newspaper calling my name.   'Read Me, Read Me'  it said.  So I did.  Sat down and started fumbling through.  First I scan the sports, because Im a non girly type of gal.  I already know. Cubs lost to Houston, 3-2.  But there is also an article about  urlLink two new pledges for the Fighting Irish.  .  Lets hope these two make a 'world of difference'.  July 1st, only a few weeks left and it'll be time to Shake Down the Thunder.  Ohhh, cant wait for those posts.    On the food/business front, awhile back Chick-Fil-A (a real classy chicken 'fast food' place) had closed on the south side of town (where I am).  Before they closed, I would take the kids to eat there often.  Getting a little tired of it, I was glad to wait for the new store to be built.  Well folks, that day has come.   urlLink The new store has opened and people went last night to camp out , to be the first in line.  They gave away 52 coupons to each person for a free combo meal.  Thats one per week!!  I may have to get some chicken today.  Yum!    This next part of the post is not going to sit well with some people.  Ive been told to cut the set lists out.

      Today was a day that showed potential at its beginning.  What the end result was, well, that's yet to be seen.  But I can't say that I have the best feeling about things.  I opened up the garage this morning to head off to work, and found my driver's side car door open.  Apparently, when I got home on Sunday night, I was so preoccupied with dragging stuff into the house that I just forgot about the door.  I didn't have anywhere to go on Monday, so my car just sat in the garage, door ajar, for a good 32 hours.  Needless to say, the battery was dead as dead can be.  So I called work, and I know I've already said this, but I'm so lucky to have the friends I do.  Britt from work came over, jumper cables in hand.  That girl is something else, I tell ya.  Heart of gold, bright, good sense of humor, and very attractive.  22 and single, to boot.  She would be exactly the kind of girl I'd love to have in my life, if it wasn't for the fact that the poor girl's got enough issues to fill a lifetime subscription.  So it goes, though - she's still a good friend.  As I pull into the strip mall that houses my place of work (and only 40 minutes late - sheesh,)  I noticed that the skate shop had a whole crapload of kids crowded around the entrance before the place even opens.  This is not a good sign.  And so, all day, in they come in groups of three to six - skaters.  Carrying their boards all around the store - skaters.  All over the parking lot - skaters.  Giving me attitude and not leaving me a tip with the money their parents gave them - skaters.  Turns out that Bam Margera of "look at me do crazy shit to myself" fame was over there signing stuff, and so every 10-to-13 year old boy with a deck in the area went to worship their idol.  Skateboarding may not be a crime... but can't we do something in the legislature to amend that situation.  This is clearly a sign of old age on my part.  So, the big event today was after work.  Going downtown to audition for this thing at Fox Sports Net.  For 10 White Sox games in July, they're featuring an "alternate" broadcast team, one member of which will be a Sox fan picked from these tryouts.  When I got there, they auditioned us in a group of 6.  We were numbers 119-124 to try out, me being 123.  First, they had us sign a waiver and do a brief quiz/survey.  Questions as basic as "What year did New Comiskey open?" (1991) to things like "Which Sox player led the league in home rums in 1971?" (Bill Melton, I said Dick Allen, oh well.)  Other questions were personal, like "Why are you a Sox fan?" and "What's the craziest thing you would do if you knew there would be absolutely no consequences?" (feel free to ask me.)  There was alos a pop culture section, asking us pop music and current events questions, along with identifying pictures of celebrities.  I got George Clooney, Carmen Electra, and Vince Vaughn; however, I had absolutely no clue who Jessica Simpson was based on her pic.  I think I'm a better person for this.  After that, they led up to a waiting area next to an office, where we were taken in one at a time for interviews.  Since they were doing it in numerical order, I was 5th on the lineup.  As the rest of us sat outside, we heard those in front of us definitely doing play-by-play a little, as they promised us we would be doing.  One staffer was waiting outside with us, and as number 122 went in for his interview, she went in with, and came out with my paperwork in hand.  She then led me to the other side of the cubicle land, to another office.  This is where I received what I'm pretty sure was a courtesy interview.  I was asked a few questions and sent on my way, never asked to do the play-by-play that the others were.  Now, I don't have any delusions about myself when it comes to my appearance.  I can dress nicely andclean up and straighten every conceivable part of me, which I did today.  But when you get right down to it, I've still got a face that, well, is better suited for radio.  My impartial opinion tells me that I was the least physically attractive of the 6 guys there, so, one look at me, and those in charge had already made up their minds.  I will be more surprised than anyone if I get a callback for the second round of interviews.  But it's not the end of the world, right?  Far from it.  There's a job fair I have to go to before work tomorrow, and I'm starting to get some ideas as to what I'm looking for in my new place to live.  Sure, the Sox thing would be an absolute dream, but I knew going in it would be a million to one shot.  In the meantime, I've got more important things to do.  Like lobbying for an ordinance to ban skating in Orland Park.

      Details of my day later on.  But first:  I was talking online to my friend Alicia, who lives about 30 miles northwest of me, when suddenly the ground just sort of... rumbled.  It was nothing jolting, just enough so you could feel it.  I thought nothing of it, till she said she felt the ground shaking in her house.  Trying to explain the weirdness over the phone to Grey at the same time, I hadn't yet told her what it was when she broke off and said "The ground's shaking over here..."  Now, Grey and I live 90 miles apart.  So, if anyone out there was up around 1:15 Central Sunday night/Monday morning, and felt the ground rumble and shake for 10-15 seconds, could you back us up on this so we know we're not all bonkers?  Honestly, what the fuck just happened?

Not till I see something new and exciting.  So dont count on it.  'Nuff said.  Friday night Superfly and I went to the Mishawaka Fest and she rode this ride that sent you upside down and all around. I watched.  I love rides, but not fair rides.  Not since I saw one crash and this chick got taken away on a stretcher.  No.  No more fair rides for ME.  Then we went to check out this band.  Meet up with some other friends and had a few beers.  Hit a few more bars and ended up at the IHOP.  Last time I looked at the clock before I wondered into this great thing called SLEEP, it was 4:39am.  So yeah.  Pretty tired the next day when Sokie woke up at 7:30.  YEAH, I slept 3 hours.  Onto my grandmas so I could drop the kids off with my mom.  WOW, I think I should take a moment and say THANK YOU MOM!  Id hate to have to leave these two at home alone. HA HA. Anyway, after I left my grandmas, I drove 20 minutes south to the Walgreens to make a copy of a picture taken on St. Patricks Day.  The machine was broke, so I had to drive 15 minutes north to another drug store to get this damn pic copied.  Finally. Bill ended up being $17.oo!!  What the?!?  I only bought the pic, a frame and a camera.  So I'm broke.  Again!  Oh yeah, then I drove a half hour south to my cousins.  I had originally planned to take a nap after I got there and helped her get things ready for the party, but it didnt happen.  People started showing up, food ended up on the grill and drinks were being drunk.  Beer that is.  Miller light even.  Corona!  Good times.  People were showing up left and right.  By the way, chicken on the grill is excellent.  Had some awesome chats with this guy who went to see Phish in Indy on Wednesday and he said it rocked.  Well duh!  So then I put my DMB sweatshirt on, and they all laughed.  :(  Kidding laughs though.  I guess when you get a group of people together, everyone thinks the same thing.  KINGS!  Sleep wasnt much of a thought for me last night either.     I said goodbye to my cousin, and yes, some tears were shed.  Cant help it.  Her and superfly are like my sisters.  I'll be ok.  Days will go by fast and soon, SOON, I myself will be on a plane to go see her. She'll be home for Christmas and that'll be all good.     Yeah, enough of that story.  Tomorrow will be another fun day with 'the visit' and then I have to meet my sister in law to buy birthday decorations for So and Mo's party on the 4th.  Something is messed up with the computer, and this sentence hasnt ended.  I mean, in this email, the page just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Ah, Im crazy, easy.  Crazy and Easy?  No comment.     I sat and watched the Cubs lose to the White Sox, shitty.  Piss on the white sox.  But the college world series was good, poor Texas.  Cute guys.  Cute guys in Texas also.    Text is working now.  Got them at 4:05 this morning.  :-)    Peace.Love.DMB.

      And that's a White Sox winner, 6-3.  See, that's part of the joy and torture that comes with being a Sox fan.  Just when you think they're don'e for, they start firing on all cylinders.  Then you start expecting them to do well, and the bottom drops out.  You really do have to have a good self-loathing streak in you to support this team.  Guess that's why the South Side and I are a natural fit.  Worked the always annoying midshift today, and then headed over to Dave and Suzzy's for some backyard festivities.  Grilling, drinking, and playing badminton in next-to-no light - now that's a quality evening, and I didn't even mention the S'mores.  A lot of Dave's wrestling buddies were there, and they're just a bunch of people who are cool as hell.  I got to meet a lot of them on Halloween and New Year's Eve, instantly clicked with them, and had a blast.  So yeah, my friend Dave used to be part of this local wrestling promotion.  He was never one to get in the ring, which is probably a good thing, since this took place during part of the 9-year stretch of Dave's life when he spent every day baked like a bundt cake.  The promotion is still going strong, it's one of those lower-level ones that makes the rounds in bars, convention halls, and hotel ballrooms, and I'd love to go to one of their shows sometimes, just from hearing about all of the crazy stuff these guys and girls script.  Tomorrow, or later today, technically, starts with work from 8-5.  Then it's off to Nicole's for her graduation party, with a giant bowl of pasta salad and a cooler of fun in hand.  Promises to be a great evening as long as the weather holds up.  I better be careful here; I'm starting to patch together something that resembles an actual social life.  Who knows what that could lead to?  So there you have it.  Go Sox!  And Grey, try to figure out what the heck's wrong with your phone so I can go back to doing what I do best - harassing you with text messages.

        flummery \FLUHM-uh-ree\, noun:    1.  A name given to various sweet dishes made with milk, eggs,    flour, etc.    2.  Empty  compliment;  unsubstantial  talk  or writing; mumbo    jumbo; nonsense.    He  had become disturbed by the number of listeners phoning      in with such flummery as tales of self-styled clairvoyants'      uncannily correct forecasts.      --Suzanne Seixas, "One Man's Finances," Money, September 1,      1986       One  reason there is so much flummery in the global warming      debate  is that the weather in the Northeast United States,      where  the  opinion-makers  live,  has  a  disproportionate      effect on whether greenhouse concerns are taken seriously.      --Gregg   Easterbrook,   "Warming   Up,"  [1]New  Republic,      November 8, 1999       It  is Dr. August's claim that he receives inspiration from      spirits,  that  through his music the departed can speak to      those   they   left  behind.  Although  this  is  sometimes      unabashed  flummery,  there  are moments when Fitz seems to      make a real connection with those who have crossed over.      --Paul  Quarrington,  "Psychic Hotline," [2]New York Times,      September 3, 2000      _________________________________________________________     Flummery comes from Welsh llymru, a soft, sour oatmeal food.

      One more before the weekend.  I got my cds.  They are awesome.  Sod and I figured that 42 minutes after dmb started playing, Sophia and Mo were born.  (Its the math thing that works for Sod.) So here I am calculating what song was playing when Sophia was born, and low and behold, it was  Dont Drink The Water .  Now, if you don't know, and how would you, only a few people know on AOL, DDTW is her favorite song.  So much so, the morning after I went to see dmb, when I woke and came downstairs, she didn't say  'good morning mom'  or  'i missed you mom' , but she said,  'did you have fun, did they play ddtw?'   Yes, I think DDTW is her fave. song.  So its just too much for me to know that song was playing when she came into this world.

      Okay, so Dave and Suzzy have developed this theory - that somehow, for some reason, Matt is quite jealous of me.  See, I have a fair amount of friends, and I do go out with them quite a bit - we have some damn good times together.  Matt, well, he isn't exactly a social butterfly.  Outside of his occasional hangouts with people from work on Fridays, his network of friends consists of me (for the time being), his brother, and one other friend.  So, he sees me going out, hanging out al the time, gets jealous, and decides to take shots at me using the one aspect of my life he knows is non-existent - my sex life.  His boasts, stories, and allusions to the frequency with which he gets some are, I realize now, either mostly bullshit, or just dirty and sloppy, so either way it's nothing for me to be envious of.  So last night, I decided to put this theory to the test.  Good times.  After a long day of shopping for kitchen stuff, I decided to kick back and play some trivia.  I went over to Buffalo Wild Wings, where the special of the evening was 23 oz. Miller Lite for $2.25.  Already, I'm the winner.  Now, if you're not familiar with bar trivia, just go  urlLink here  and find out what it's all about.  It's addictive and fun, and with my love of game shows and useless knowledge, it's a perfect fit for me.  I played several games and came in 2nd place in a very competitive field every single game, losing one by only about 70 points.  The big hour-long game, which I played in between spicy garlic wings, was by far the highlight.  I was in the running all the way, going neck and neck with this regular, who is one of several who plays the big games there every single Tuesday and Thursday.  He also happens to be a former professor of mine - brilliant, Serbian, and at least a little bit nuts.  I don't know if he remembers me or knows that I play on occasion, but it sure is great to give him a run for his money.  So, the final round involves 6 questions in 6 different categories (the game, by the way, is called "Six",) which each player must assign point values to before answering.  The final question of the game comes up, we both get it correct right away for the maximum points - but he had wagered 6000 and I'd bet only 3000.  I lost the game by a scant 2500 - so close, but so far away.  Oh well, another draft will pick me up - and make the part of my brain where all the trivia is stored function a bit more smoothly.  Dunring my stay at BW3, I get a call.  It's Matt, no doubt wondering where I am.  I choose to press the "Ignore" button.  The voicemail he leaves confirms my suspicions.  Why does he care where I am?  Maybe he wants to know for certain that the coast is clear to bring some of his nasty action around.  Who knows, who cares.  A little later on, I get a call from the beloved Suzzy - it's Thursday night, and we're going out!  So a few of us head out, have a few, have some good times (Katrina's goal for the evening was to get drunk, and I'm happy to report that she succeeded).    Instead of going "home" after the bar closed, I decided to spend the night at my parents' house - they're on vacation all this week and next and told me that I'm welcome to stay there whenever I feel the need.  This was my plan for the night anyway, whether I'd be going to the bar or not.  I had my toothbrush and contact stuff packed, along with a few CDs.  It was a little odd being in my old bed, in my old room, the room is kinda empty now and has quite a bit of echo to it.  That, and where the heck is my other pillow?  There's only one on my bed now.  Had a peaceful night's sleep, the sounds of Mer de Noms faintly in my ears as I drifted off.  Wake up this morning, renewed, refreshed - with a new voicemail from Matt on my phone, wondering where I am, and if I "got lucky" last night, he says with a hearty laugh.  So I eventually make my way home, and I'm in quite a good mood.  Smiling and just generally happy.  And Matt's home, and seeing my emotional state, he's just like "What were you doing last night?  Oh my God, you *did* get laid."  So I just respond with "If that's what you want to think, you go ahead and think that."  You know, not confirming anything, but not denying anything either, just being deliberately ambiguous.  "I... I don't know what to think anymore," he says, walking away.  Now I"ve got him wondering, and I'm the one having fun at his expense.  It's good to have the tables turned.  So... no Grey this weekend.  She'll be off on an exotic getaway to a faraway land.  And as usual, I'll miss her.  But thankfully, I've got something to fill up my weekend besides work.  Promises to be fun.  And of course, best birthday wishes and much love to Sokie and Mo on the big 4.  Peace out.

      Yeah, so it's Friday again and last night was the LAST exam in Psychology.  Don't get to excited for me, I still have a final on Tuesday.  I got done with the exam in about a half an hour, so that made it 6:30pm.  Headed out to the Big Mall to get a birthday gift for tonight's gathering at the lake.  Then I went to the bar to meet up with Superfly.  Cam and Chica showed up.  Chica is a spitting image of  urlLink Halle Berry,  so every guy in the bar stares, and one or two will approach her.  It's funny to watch them.  They look our way, keep looking back about twenty more times, then finally get up enough nerve to come talk to her.  Some have sent their friends over to talk to her.  This is NOT what a girl wants.  At least not any of us around here.  If you cant talk to the girl, dont even bother sending your friend.  So last night, this guy, I'll call him 'Hilton Head', because thats what his shirt had on it, kept staring and playing the game of 'I'm looking at you, are you looking at me?' No, she wasnt.  Cam and I watched as he put the cue stick above him as if to stretch and tried to be cool while he walked over. Before we could warn Chica, he was there.   Asking her if she wanted to shoot pool. He walked away with nothing.  Cam and I like to people watch, him and I were in NYC people watching while Superfly and Nikki were bickering back and forth.   'We gotta get on the blue line train to get on the red line train to get to the xy path'  and so on.  Yeah, if you're from NYC and I messed up the colors of the train, Fuck Me.  It's been a few months and I have real shit going on.  I really need to take my tape recorder with me and get this all on tape sometime.  But then I think, would it even be funny in writing?  Because you sitting there reading this with nothing to alter your mind, might be like, this girl is freaking insane!  INSANE- At one point Superfly made this god awful noise, we think it was a burp, but coming from Superfly, it sounded horrible, and she gets up to go somewhere, and says 'brb' (we have this inside joke about 'lol' and 'brb' and all that other online crap) and Cam goes, "Beer Right Back Up' you mean.  Heh. yeah, not that funny right now.   Sports Report  No wins or losses from last night.  Tonight we play the cards.    Aww, no set lists either.  Sorry Av.    peace.love.dmb.   Happy Birthday to Sokie and Mo.    I survived 4 years!  Time for lunch.

      Tired, so tired.  Physically exhausted, yeah, but just plain tired of some other stuff as well.  Don't care to go into it now, because I haven't got the energy and I don't care to dredge up the way I've been feeling about things all over again.  Just need to move on, move forward, and focus on the important tasks at hand.  Did the radio station thing this morning, 7-11, before my 12-9 shift at the regular job.  The radio job is something that I truly love.  It's a hobby, something I do for fun that I just happen to get paid for.  If I could make a career in radio, I'd be just about as happy as I could be.  So, since the station is on a satellite feed with scheduled local breaks, we pre-record news, sports, weather, and traffic reports and feed them into the scheduling computer, which plays them at the right time just as we line them up.  So I write and record my sports report, schedule it for 9:12, the time comes for it to play and... it sounds like I'm broadcasting sports headlines out of a shitty drive-thru speaker at Taco Bell.  Immediately, the sound goes down, music comes up in its place, and my manager and I are trying to figure out what in the flying fuck just happened.  Check the file on the editing computer - sounds perfect, well as perfect as anything can sound that has to involve my voice.  Check it on the scheduling comp - hey, it sounds just fine there too.  So, I re-copy the report into the scheduler, play it at 9:50... and it's flawless.  Go figure.  The joys of technology.  That's it for me now.  Might touch on the other stuff some other time.  Right now though, I'd rather not think about it unless forced to.

      Ugh, swept out of Wrigley.  The White Sox did what we, as Sox fans, expect from them.  They bent over and grabbed their ankles right when the pressure was on.  There's so much inherent pessimism in being a White Sox fan, knowing your team is, has been, and always will be second-class in this town.  It's something to be embraced rather than fought, really.  It builds character.  Right.  So now, I owe Grey dinner at  urlLink The Parthenon ... assuming that she ever has any free time to make it out to Chicago for dinner.  She has her weekends full till about November, I think, and weekdays, well, that's just a lost cause.  This could very well be one bet I never have to pay out.  Saturday night, I went out to see my friend's boyfriend's band play a bar gig.  They had a great hard rock sound and did a cover of Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" that sounded incredible, with a drum solo that blew everyone away.  Unfortunately, they were too loud for the venue, it was pouring rain off and on, and the town they were playing in was having their fireworks that night.  So, put that all together, and the end result is a less-than-spectacular turnout.  Staying the whole time though, were two guys in their late 40s wearing NASCAR apparel, rocking out like there was no tomorrow.  (We were out in the eight-one-five, where the downstate twang starts showing up and people think stock car racing is half-sport, half-religion, when in fact it's neither.)  But I told Dan (the aforementioned boyfriend of my friend) that hey, if Cheap Trick can make it big in Japan, there's no reason Desert Plenty can't get their start with the NASCAR crowd.  Sometimes, you find your fans in unexpected places.  Matt's decided that a summer job is just too much to handle.  So that means I've only got 2 weeks left here of having 3 mornings out of the week to myself.  After that, an already-uncomfortable situation will get a little extra boost.  I can't wait to get out of here.  Job listings this week, well, pretty much suck.  But I can't afford to be picky at this point - I'll take just about whatever I can find that will allow me to be self-sufficient.  Speaking of job listings, Grey and I were talking on the phone last night, both dead tired and slap-happy, her from the birthday party, me from a classic 14-hour shift at work.  Now, I'm willing to cut her some slack because we were both sleepy at the time and laughing like a couple of freshly baked stoners, but she insists that if you drop a letter off at the post office on Sunday night (when it's closed,) and the destination is fairly local, that letter will reach its recipient by Monday afternoon, when the mail is delivered.  I say the earliest it gets there is Tuesday, because that letter's not getting touched until Monday morning at the earliest, it's not arriving in a mailbox till Tuesday.  She says she will prove it to me by mailing a letter to herself next Sunday night.  I think that if she was any more full of beans, she'd qualify for farm subsidies.  Especially since I'm working with the metro Chicago postal service, the same people who took 3 letters from me on Thursday, all addressed to the same place, and only one of them showed up on Saturday.  Monday afternoon, my ass.

       Dave Matthews Band Saturday  July 3 2004  Saratoga Performing Arts Center  Everyday  So Much To Say  Too Much  New Song #1  Granny  Warehouse  One Sweet World  New Song #4  Drive In Drive Out  Bartender  New Song #3  Where Are You Going  Jimi Thing  New Song #2  Crash  Rapunzel   __________________   Bass Intro  Crush  Stay     This past 4th of July was something to remember. I had the kids party and family came over.  Time well spent and good food.  Mo got a  Web blaster  and the can of 'webs' lasted a whopping ten seconds.  So now mom needs to get refills so he can squirt webs all over the house.  Sophia got dress up clothes and a Birthday Barbie.  They both got clothes also.  Highlight of the day was their bikes from grandma and papa.  Spiderman bike for Mo and a Disney Princess bike for Sokie.  All the rain made it rough to ride yesterday, so today seems like it will be filled with a lot of hours outside.  Pool sounds good too.   Sports Wrapup  Last game of the 3 game series of crosstown traffic-Cubs and White Sox.  Cubs already had two wins, and as my brother and I watched bits and pieces of last nights game, we thought it could go either way.  Getting dark outside, the kids wanted to see fireworks.  So we headed outside and took part in all the 'ohhhs and ahhhhs' that seem to accompany fire.  Going back and forth to check on the score of the game, it  urlLink finally ended  with a White Sox pitcher who choked on a 3-2 count.  The crowd at Wrigley went nuts.  The night ended in Cubbie fan favor.  Cubs 2~White Sox 1.   Local News.   urlLink This kid .  18 years old.  He was driving in his pickup truck and hit two 15 year olds on a moped.  His toxicology reports found marijuana in his blood.  He will be charged with two class D felony counts.  The article states that if he was 21 he could face tougher charges.  I thought that 18 meant you were an adult?  Why does it matter if he was 18 or 21?  Another thing is, the court doesn't have to prove he smoked before the accident, THC stays in the blood and fat tissue sometimes up to 30 days.  So whether he smoked that night or last month, it is still going against him.  Read it and decide for yourself.   peace.love.dmb.

        Thursday     &nbsp;  So close, yet so far away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost the big trivia game by 1,600 points this week.&nbsp; At the last second on a question about playwrights, I changed my answer from Edward Albee to Eugene O'Neill, and lost 2,000 points because of it.&nbsp; You do the math.&nbsp; Still ranked #20 across the whole network though, so I reckon I didn't do all that bad.&nbsp; I'd just like to beat my prof - and I might have beaten him, too, if his friend next to him wasn't feeding him answers to all the sports questions.    &nbsp;  After that, it was out to the pub with the gang from work for the usual Thursday night thing.&nbsp; Liana's 21st birthday was that night, so of course it was a special occasion.&nbsp; Poor little Liana, you'd think that after two years at Eastern, she'd have built up some hardcore tolerance - but we had her all giggly and slap-happy in 45 minutes.&nbsp; You're swimming with the big fish now, sunshine.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  We closed down the place, and Nick told us that he was watching his sister's condo while she was on vacation, and we were all invited to stop by.&nbsp; So I headed over, along with Suzzy and Katrina.&nbsp; The complex is situated below street level, so that leading from the street down to the parking lot, there's a steep hill, about 20 feet high with a 45 degree slope.&nbsp; The three of us were waiting outside in the lot (because Nick had left his sister's keys at home... dumbass,) when Katrina sprung up and climbed the hill.&nbsp; She gets to the top, yells "Hey guys!" and promptly falls over and rolls all the way down.&nbsp; We run over to her, she pops up and goes "Wow!&nbsp; That was the most violent thing ever!"&nbsp; And so of course we all decide to climb up to the top, beers in hand while we wait for Nick.&nbsp; A few minutes later, Katrina stands up and decides to walk down the hill.&nbsp; Now as you might guess, she was pretty damn tipsy, so I stand up and hold her hand just to steady her&nbsp; Raise your hand if you see where this one is going.&nbsp; She lets go of my hand, and promptly goes for another roll down the hill.&nbsp; I follow her down, walking at first, picking up speed a little as I near the bottom, and as I get close to her, I find a nice wet patch of grass.&nbsp; BOOM.&nbsp; Right down on my tailbone.&nbsp; Fun stuff.&nbsp; Nick finally showed up, and we spent the night drinking, talking about whatever, sitting out on the balcony, and trying to all&nbsp;sleep in the same bed (what an ill-conceived idea that was.)&nbsp; We finally cashed out at around 7 in the morning.    &nbsp;  Before we went to sleep, Suzzy, having sobered up a good deal, had me come out with her on the balcony while she lit up a cigarette.&nbsp; We sat down and talked, and she told me some stuff about the way she feels toward me that was absolutely incredible.&nbsp; She's an absolutely amazing friend, one whom I'm very lucky to have.&nbsp; Between Wednesday and Thursday, I had two of my friends tell me things that, dare I say, gave me feelings of confidence and self-esteem.&nbsp; It's just so good to know that there are people who like me, and love me, just because of who I am.&nbsp; It also makes me wonder if I really want to move out of state when the whole scenario is said and done - I don't know that I want to leave people like these.    &nbsp;   Friday     &nbsp;  Another&nbsp;Friday night&nbsp;of "musical" entertainment in the cafe.&nbsp; Last week, we had a band called Seven Day Run, who were downright professional.&nbsp; I mean, they actually sounded really good, and that's not something I'm used to from the acts in the cafe.&nbsp; Their sound had a little bit of DMB and Sister Hazel mixed into it, it seemed, and it worked really well.&nbsp; Of course, for every yin, there must be a yang, and man, did we ever get yanged last night.&nbsp; Two hippie chicks with a dulcimer and a banjo.&nbsp; If I didn't know better, I would have thought they were shooting a sequel to "A Mighty Wind," because they were so bad, it was downright comical.&nbsp; Some people in the crowd actuallly seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I felt like shouting at them "No!&nbsp; Don't clap!&nbsp; You're only encouraging them!"&nbsp; One of the managers, Matthew, gives me a call and says, "I know you're suffering over there right now, so I thought I might cheer you up with some readings from the Garfield Joke Book..."&nbsp; He's a sick bastard, I tell ya.&nbsp; And then it happened:&nbsp; in the middle of a song, one of the ladies starting wailing away... on the kazoo.&nbsp; You could see every single employee in the store turn their heads toward the cafe, with an expression that simply said, "What the fuck?!?"&nbsp; A couple of people at the info desk&nbsp;turned their eyes to me for my reaction.&nbsp; I simply held up a sign, written in red marker, that read "HELP ME."&nbsp; Britt came by when I got a line (how that kazoo&nbsp;didn't drive every last customer out of the store, I'll never know,) and she asked me, "So, how about that kazoo, huh?"&nbsp; and I was like "Oh, it was great and all, but you know what I could really use right now?"&nbsp; "What?"&nbsp; "I need more cowbell."&nbsp; Britt almost fell over laughing.&nbsp; I realize that won't make any sense to you unless you've seen Saturday Night Live's "Best of Will Ferrell" collection, which is why you need to go rent it or buy it right now.&nbsp; You'll be all about the cowbell, too.&nbsp; At least tips were good last night.&nbsp; Some customers would drop in money, look over at the band, and offer me their sympathies.&nbsp; Hey, whatever pays the bills.

      I just got done posting the set list (for you av) and the word of the day, for Friday and Saturday.  I figured I should type out some random bullshit to make it seem like I just dont use this blog for set list and words that people probably dont even read. =')  So here I am, waking up on a Saturday morning, before noon.  Waking up to kids who smell like syrup.  Not my favorite smell, but I can handle it.  The kids and I, along with my mom and dad and my brothers family, all went up to St. Joe, MI for the Venetian Festival.  It Started to rain on the way up, so we ended up eating at this restaurant.  Stooges-no one go there if you're ever in St. Joe.  Food was real good, but the owner was a bitch who didn't get her medication.  There was nine of us, five adults and four kids.  There was a table for six and about four booths that sat four, open when we arrived.  We were told that they had no idea how long we would wait.  I asked if some of us could sit at the table and the others sit at a booth.  I was told that isn't policy.  So the next time the hostess came back, I told her that we didn't know my brother and his family and that we wanted to sit down at the table.  The owner was going all crazy telling me that they couldn't spilt up groups.  I told her that's OK, I didn't even know that group.  After a good five minutes of a 'disagreement', we all had a place to sit and hoped we wouldn't get someone's bodily fluid in our dinner.  Im not sick yet.    After dinner, we all walked down to the bluff near Lake Michigan to find a place to sit for the fireworks.  There was a band playing and my brother and I looked at each other and both thought the same thing. Then I hear Sophia say, 'Dave Matthews!'  No folks, it wasn't Dave Matthews, but it was a band who sounded like them.  Walked over to check them out.  Kids got out and danced like the little hippies that they are.  This band was pretty good.  They ended with an almost exact dmb version of 'Watchtower'.  I tell ya, people know when Im coming around.    Continued on to find a spot to lay our blankets and to find one of those god awful Joy Johns.  I don't know what the Joy is all about, I hate those things.  Took Mo in one and he ended up gagging and spitting.  Saying things like, 'It smells in here.  I'm going to throw up.'  OK Mo, we all feel like that.  I've even lost a phone in one!!!  Another story, another time.  Ask me if you know me, or if you even care. Wrapping up this saga, the fireworks were awesome, a good half hour.    Onto a baby shower this afternoon.  Oh, I know you cant wait to hear about that one.  =)  Sports Report Won one, lost one in the Milwaukee series.  This is where it really matters too, we need to win and not get behind that 8 games out second place slot to this Brewer team.  Playing St. Louis this weekend.  beer...sounds...good.  But! , I cant....give....in.  Even with teeth clinching.  By the way, if you got my email about the wisdom teeth, I don't have mine because I never had the roots for them, Im not a toothless chic.  Ya dig!?!  Nancies Report Well, I think ya got it down below in my set list.  Have fun!  Local Report Now, I dont have the link to the story yet, but my mom was telling me that a lady who is mentally retarded got on the bypass going the wrong way one day last week.  She hit a car with a dad, mom and three kids.  The dad died and the three year old child had serious spinal cord injuries.  He was flown to Rileys Children's Hospital in Indianapolis.  Supposedly the prosecutor is trying to figure out how and why this lady had a drivers license.  A spokesman from the BMV said that anyone can get a drivers license, even if they do not KNOW HOW TO READ.  They can take an oral test and then pass the drivers test....without knowing HOW TO READ!  This boggles my mind, more so than the crack head owner of the restaurant.  So if you're driving down the road and you see someone going the wrong way, you might be able to thank the BMV for letting someone out who cant read a sign that says WRONG WAY or DO NOT ENTER.    ya'll have a nice day now.  peace.LOVE.dmb.

Believed  to  have  originated  in  India  in ancient times      before first ravaging the Roman world as early as A.D. 165,      since  then  it  [smallpox]  had  scourged humanity in what      amounted to a permanent pandemic, causing incalculable loss      of life and misery through morbidity and disfigurement.      --Frank Ryan, M.D., [1]Virus X       Within  a  decade,  half  a  million  had  perished.

Hollinger,  "Star  Power,"  [2]New York Times,      November 28, 1999       The  strength  of  the hypothesis is that it simultaneously      explains  all  these  salient  features,  none of which had      satisfactory independent explanations.      --Paul  F.

         I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in...    I've learned that one good turn gets most of the blankets.   I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just jackasses.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.    I've learned that whatever hits the fan will not be evenly distributed.    I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.  I've learned that it is not what you wear; it is how you take it off.

I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it   I've learned that there is a fine line between genius and insanity.   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. And the real pains in the ass are permanent.

The  act  of pouring a liquid (usually wine) either on the    ground  or  on  a victim in sacrifice to some deity; also, the    wine or liquid thus poured out.    2. A beverage, especially an alcoholic beverage.    3. An act or instance of drinking.       Hearing that the train had lost one of its engines and that      the  remainder of the trip would be very slow, I headed for      the  bar car for a libation and a snack or two to soothe my      growing hunger pangs.      --Lawrence  Van  Gelder,  "Tales of Flying Cars and Trees,"      [1]New York Times, May 28, 2000       Giving  careful  packing  instructions  to  his Sherpas who      would be freighting the spirits to his Base Camp, Todd more      than  half-anticipated  some nights when the libation might      serve to take off the edge.      --Anatoli Boukreev and G.

      First off, I have to say James Franco is the shiz.  Maybe not the best actor, but great to look at.    urlLink    james franco Now you can join in my fantasy.  OK.  Yes, I went to see Spiderman II last night.  By the way, the psychology final was awesome.  He took the questions right outta the study guide, word for word, answers in the same order.  It was great.  Finished by 6:20.  Back to Spiderman.  I thought the action scenes were really good, but a lot of talking.  A lot of talking about emotions and hero-ish type explanations.  I also thought they made a good connection between the comic books and the movie by showing how Peter Parker couldn't keep a job because he was out fighting evil.  This second movie was also a bit more 'scary'. Thanks to Evan, I hear Spiderman III is in the works.  Harry coming back as the Green Goblin?  God, I hope so. Next up-Anchorman.  Gotta see that.  It's time for a comedy.     Sports Report  Seems as though the American League won 9-4.

      I was reading  urlLink Yahoo  news, and I came across this story-   Judge Pleads No Contest to Fondling Girl     WILKES-BARRE, Pa. - A county judge accused of fondling a 10-year-old girl at a teen pop concert pleaded no contest Monday, the day his trial was to begin.   Mark Pazuhanich was sentenced to 10 years probation and must register as a sex offender. He tearfully said in court that he would resign his Monroe County judgeship. Pazuhanich blamed his problems on alcohol and medication.   The victim testified at a hearing in January that Pazuhanich touched her inappropriately throughout the Hilary Duff concert on Nov. 29, several weeks after he was elected to the bench.   Pazuhanich pleaded no contest to two counts of indecent assault, one count of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of corruption of minors.   Earlier, a judge suspended Pazuhanich's visitation rights with his daughter, who lives with her mother in New Jersey and attended the concert with him. As part of Monday's settlement, Pazuhanich must stay away from his daughter unless the visit is supervised and approved by the court.    Now, isn't it nice that people can use alcohol and drugs as an excuse?  This is ridiculous. Makes me want to puke.  On another happy note, seems as though the infamous  urlLink Kobe Bryant  doesn't want cameras in the court room for his rape trial.  Too bad, I wanted to see his face again before he gets screwed, just like he did in D-Town.    {sidenote} I really doubt that Mr.Bryant will get any stiff fines or jail time for his actions, but I do have something for him.  For all the good men out there, wherever you are, don't take this as an insult, rather, take it as a Fuck You Kobe.     Ah, excuse me Mr.  Do you have the time?

      Well, to sum up the weekend briefly, I got my roommate to basically give me $40 without even realizing what he was doing, went to a party after work on Saturday, lost about a pint of blood to mosquitoes in the backyard while playing frisbee, worked the usual Friday-Saturday-Sunday stretch, and spent this evening sending out cover letters and resumes with the sincere hope that something will soon pop.  I was planning on writing more tonight, filling in with stories, details, and the like, but I find myself feeling uncomfortable again for some stupid reasons.  I know that I have neither right nor reason to feel the way I do, and yet here I am.  Nerves frayed, acid rising, throat burning.  I need to figure out how to get a hold of myself, calm myself down, and stop thinking in this ridiculous and unproductive manner.  It's not doing me any good to be this way about things, and I know it - I just need to figure out within myself how to fix it.  There are too many important and pressing concerns for me right now to be thinking this way.  Gotta keep plowing forward.

      So the title of this post is pretty much self explanatory.  I went to a Greek wedding last night and it was something out of the movies.  Yes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  Good guess.  Anyway, they had the cake and all the other desserts and the polkas(which by the way are polish) AND they had the Greek dances where everyone dances around in a circle, or something.  I went outside when all that fun started.  Before all the dancing though, the best man gave about a ten minute speech, but it was well worth it.  The bar was only serving Bud and Bud light, amongst all the 'hard' liquor.  I saw some bottles of Miller Light and went on a mission to find where they were coming from.  Seems as though the wedding party had a cooler full of them from the Transpo Trolley(instead of renting a limo, they got the city transpo trolley to drive them around downtown south bend)  So being the good friend that I am of the bride, I got me some beer worth drinking for the rest of the night.  Good food, great company and an even better kisser made the night.     Sports Report  Looks like the wooden broom took a shit.

       What a wonderful way to spend an evening.&nbsp; At work?&nbsp; Yep, you bet your sweet ass, at work.&nbsp; Went to dinner with Britt, where we had a grand old time with chips, guacamole, and salsa.&nbsp; It was one of those glorious hours when Britt let her guard down, stopped being so overly self-conscious and uncomfortable in her own skin, and just decided to be herself and let it all hang out.&nbsp; You can tell when she's like this from every aspect of her - the way she talks, how she dresses, the way she carries herself.&nbsp; I was in tears from laughing so hard at the off-the-wall stuff she was coming up with.&nbsp; And from this point on, "fish fry"&nbsp;shall be&nbsp;an insult to be dished out whenever possible.&nbsp; Britt is an absolutely fantastic and beautiful girl.&nbsp; Here's hoping that one day she realizes it.    &nbsp;  Tonight's "entertainment" went by the name of Ben Hollis.&nbsp; Now, about 15 years ago, Ben Hollis created a local show called "Wild Chicago" that aired on Channel 11 and featured him in safari gear paying visits&nbsp;all kinds of wacky and offbeat sights and stops around our fair city and surrounding suburbs.&nbsp; The show was great, and became quite a cult phenomenon.&nbsp; A few years afterward, Ben decided that he needed to move on to bigger things, someone else took the reins of the series, and it ran for a good long while.&nbsp; Well, those "bigger things" turned out to be him doing the exact same thing on Channel 50 for a show called "Ben Loves Chicago," followed by the exact same thing again on Channel 20, called "Ben Around Town."&nbsp; Last year, he put out a CD, and toured Borders all around Chicago promoting it.&nbsp; When he came to our store, he was part of a 5-man&nbsp;outfit that was loud, not all that good, and all the time he was acting like he was hot shit.    &nbsp;  Mercy, what a difference a year makes.&nbsp; The Ben Hollis who came in tonight looked a good 15 years older than the one who strutted his way into our fair store last summer.&nbsp; Gone were the beret (to cover up the inevitable march of time against his hairline) and the trendy black getup.&nbsp; In its place was the frazzled and balding look, a Hawaiian shirt with jeans, and&nbsp; half-circle glasses with a cord attached.&nbsp; One look at him made me picture a young boy saying to his mother, 20 years from&nbsp;now, "Mommy, should Grandpa really be going to the Jimmy Buffett concert all by himself?"&nbsp; Oh, in lieu of the 5-man extravaganza, this time it was Ben with an acoustic guitar, and his friend with a flute.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it.&nbsp; Let's hear it for that bumpin' bass section!&nbsp; How 'bout them phat percussion beats?&nbsp; Awww yeah!&nbsp; He did about a 40 minute set with next to no audience response, and went on his way.&nbsp; One of the Friday night regs came up to me afterwards and asked me, "That had to be the shortest set I've ever seen here.&nbsp; Has he gone already?"&nbsp; I responded, "Yep, he just kinda disappeared off into the night without a trace."&nbsp; To which the customer said, "Wow, just like his television career."&nbsp; Ba-zing!&nbsp; I do believe someone has been taken down a peg or two.&nbsp; Fading star or not, Britt still wants to jack his Subaru and go joyriding around the suburbs, putting on a one-woman Thelma-and-Louise exhibition.    &nbsp;  Business was slow, and the store was adequately staffed for once, so we all took advantage of the situation and spent a good part of the night wandering about and bullshitting with each other.&nbsp; Well, moreso than we normally do.&nbsp; After we closed up, I got the frisbee out of my car, and a few of us&nbsp;tossed it around the parking lot.&nbsp; All in all, a damn fine end to a lovely evening at our humble monument to commerce.

       This was on my MSN today.. and it was so disturbing that I couldnt look away...   Man charged with swinging gator at girlfriend      Florida woman alleges 3-foot pet alligator hit her at least once     The Associated Press Updated: 2:00 p.m.&nbsp;ET July&nbsp;17, 2004     PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A man hit his girlfriend with a 3-foot alligator and threw beer bottles at her during an argument in the couple’s mobile home, authorities said. David Havenner, 41, was scheduled for a bond hearing Saturday on misdemeanor charges of battery and possession of an alligator.      The alligator, which Havenner had been keeping in his bathtub, was turned over to Florida wildlife officials. Nancy Monico, 39, told investigators that Havenner beat her with his fists, then grabbed the alligator and swung it at her as she tried to escape, sheriff’s spokesman Gary Davidson said. She said the animal hit her at least once. She also told authorities that Havenner threw empty beer bottles at her, Davidson said. Havenner’s version of the story differed. He told investigators that Monico bit his hand because she was upset that they had run out of alcohol.     © 2004 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

          Cubs power Maddux to win No. 298        &nbsp;     Club hits cycle of homers  ;      Maddux goes the distance         By&nbsp;Carrie Muskat&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com   CHICAGO -- It's 298 down and two to go for Greg Maddux.  Aramis Ramirez belted a grand slam and Moises Alou hit a pair of home runs to back Maddux's 298th career win and power the Chicago Cubs to a 13-2 victory Thursday over the Cincinnati Reds.       Maddux (9-7) is two wins away from becoming the 22nd Major League pitcher to reach 300 career wins. He gave up two runs -- both on solo homers by Javier Valentin -- on four hits in his second straight complete game. He struck out six. Maddux had tossed a six-hit shutout against Milwaukee in his last start.       Mark Grudzielanek also hit a three-run homer for the Cubs, and the 13 runs scored is a season high. Ramirez connected on his slam in the sixth, the third by a Cubs player this year and fourth by the third baseman in his career.       Both of Alou's home runs came on the first pitch he saw from Reds starter Cory Lidle (6-8). He led off the second with his 23rd and launched No. 24 with two outs and a runner on in the third for his 25th career multi-homer game and his second this year. Alou hit 22 home runs total last year for the Cubs.       Alex Gonzalez and Paul Bako each singled in the Chicago fourth, and both scored on Grudzielanek's home run, his second. He had missed nearly three months because of a sore Achilles.       Alou walked to open the fifth, although he had to dodge a curve ball that was a little close to his head during his at-bat. It appeared that home plate umpire Bill Hohn issued a warning to both benches after the pitch. Derrek Lee followed with an RBI double and scored one out later on Gonzalez's double to open an 8-2 lead.        &nbsp;   urlLink  Carrie Muskat    is a reporter for MLB.com.

       Man, did my neighborhood ever get nailed yesterday by the storms.&nbsp; Power's out, whole sections of fences are blown down, and all around, there are assorted chunks o' tree.&nbsp; My personal favorite is the rather large piece that broke off of the top of a very tall tree and landed partly on our garage, partly on our power lines.&nbsp; It's still sitting there happily - or at least it was when I left the darkened, hot, and humid house this afternoon for the creature comforts of the computer lab at school.&nbsp; The sound of chainsaws and woodchippers was all around the neighborhood, just not on our block.&nbsp; Hopefully they will have finished the cleanup by this evening.&nbsp; If not, then all of the food in the fridge and freezer&nbsp;is a lost cause.    &nbsp;  When I came home to the carnage last night, Matt was there, and he said, "Well, let's go out to eat, maybe catch a movie, there's no point in sticking around here."&nbsp; The man does make a good point every now and again.&nbsp; So after&nbsp;some deep-dish and a couple of pints of Killian's (and by the way, if you'd ever like to see me turn into a really cheap date, start sending the Killian's my way,)&nbsp; we head on to the theater.&nbsp; Listening to the radio, and an ad for some *ahem* "gentlemen's club" comes on, and Matt goes, "Ooooh!&nbsp; Gentlemen's club!"&nbsp; Completely joking, I say to Matt, "Skybox?"&nbsp; "Alright, we're going."&nbsp; And so the evening takes yet another unexpected turn.    &nbsp;  The only other time I've been to a strip club was on a Saturday night, when Dave and Suzzy took me there for my birthday.&nbsp; 10 bucks got you in, drinks were a dollar.&nbsp; Well, to lure people in for weeknights, the cover still applies, but hey, the drinks are free!&nbsp; Marketing at its very finest, I tell ya.&nbsp; They should teach business classes using these places as models.&nbsp; And so, the bottles of Miller Lite kept magically appearing, and, er, disappearing.&nbsp; Had a couple lapdances from a girl who absolutely killed me with eye contact.&nbsp; She did have a gorgeous body, but it was her down to earth way of playing the game and the looks she shot me with those eyes that made her stand out and made me willing to hand over the $20.&nbsp; Little things like that just get me, I guess.&nbsp; Oh, the $10 cover got you a 2-for-1 dance coupon, too.&nbsp; Well played, sirs.&nbsp; As for being there with Matt, well, the beer made me care a lot less, obviously.&nbsp; I just rolled with the evening.&nbsp; It wasn't really spending a night out with him - he just happened to be sitting at my table.&nbsp; Didn't let it keep me from having a fine time.    &nbsp;  Highlight from work yesterday: I had punched out and was talking at the info desk with Jaymie, Allison, and Katrina.&nbsp; They pointed over to a guy who was on the couch in the cafe, asleep, and snoring loudly.&nbsp; They couldn't get him to wake up, and someone suggested dropping a heavy book on the table in front of him.&nbsp; So I grab a hardbound abridged edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (3,000-ish pages), walk over to him, and man, I can't do it to the poor guy.&nbsp; So I poke him a few times, "Sir?&nbsp; Sir?&nbsp; Excuse me, sir?"&nbsp; His response: louder snoring.&nbsp; So I brace myself raise the book, and BOOM.&nbsp; Once again, louder snoring.&nbsp; The whole cafe is laughing now, and I'll be damned if I'm not gonna fix this.&nbsp; So i run back to the cafe, grab an electronic timer, set it for one second, and put it right up to his ear.&nbsp; BEE-BEE-BEE-BEEP!&nbsp; BEE-BEE-BEE-BEEP!&nbsp; Sounds just like an alarm clock, and has the same effect too - he's up with&nbsp;a shot.&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; What's going on?"&nbsp; "Oh, sorry sir, you just seemed to have fallen asleep on the couch and we were just concerned, just wanted to make sure you were okay."&nbsp; I walk away and put the timer back.&nbsp; Suzzy goes into the backroom of the cafe and damn near pisses herself laughing.&nbsp; This is why I love my dumb little job.

       Matt came home and was pissed because, God forbid, I didn't wash the dishes immediately after finishing eating.&nbsp; I had them in hot soapy water in the sink, you know, what normal people do.&nbsp; So he  told  me, "You need to clean those dishes."&nbsp; And I said "okay" because, you know, I was going to, just not at the exact moment he ordered me to, because after all, I am a somewhat-grown adult, not his obedient child or&nbsp;personal manservant.&nbsp;&nbsp;So after a while, Matt made a phone call in the other room, and underneath the sound of the TV I heard "I'm just sick of it... can't take it anymore... little things you notice... gonna have to sit down and talk to him... this week."&nbsp; Maybe it's a case of me just hearing what my ears are trained to hear, and what they want to interpret out of it,&nbsp;but it certainly sounded like the shit is about to hit the fan even worse, whenever he decides to sit me down and scold me like I'm a fucking student of his.&nbsp; When I get very stressed or extremely upset, the acid starts rising out of my stomach and burning like crazy in my throat.&nbsp; This doesn't happen to me over little or stupid things - er, at least not usually; let's not talk about last week.&nbsp; This only happens when it's something major or something that has built up and is ready to boil over.&nbsp; It got so bad at that moment I actually thought I was going to throw up.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Hopefully this is all just a case of my mind wandering too far off.&nbsp; I wasn't exactly in the best frame of mind before this little episode went down, anyway.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;Matt decides to initiate&nbsp;a talk in the near future, this house is going to bear witness to a really bad scene, and I'm gonna need some more Pepcid.

       I got home from work last night to find that Matt had invited his family over.&nbsp; Now, normally I wouldn't have the slightest problem with this.&nbsp; But, his family decided to bring over their purebred schnauzer.&nbsp; This high-strung little bastard of a dog positively hates every person who is not a member of Matt's immediate family.&nbsp; So as soon as I walk in the door, I'm greeted by incessant growling, yelping, and snapping.&nbsp; Yeah, that's what I look forward to after a long day of work.&nbsp; I just went about making and eating my dinner as quickly and&nbsp;quietly as possible and spent the rest of the night in my room, otherwise I may have ended up punting the little fucker across the house.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Sunday mornings are now the time for perusing the classifieds.&nbsp; So far, not so good.&nbsp; I'm actually considering responding to an ad for 10-key data entry *shudder*.&nbsp; Just gotta keep looking a little harder.&nbsp; 1 month down and only 2 to go.

I wasn't going to go out last night.&nbsp; I had been up late, again, the past few nights.&nbsp; I just cant seem to get any rest.&nbsp; Learning to say no is something on my  To Do List. &nbsp; Yesterday morning I had some personal stuff to take care of, then I came home and took a nap.&nbsp; Or, some what of a nap.&nbsp; Hard to actually sleep with So and Mo running around.&nbsp; Pretty much just did the mom routine and got them to bed at a decent time.&nbsp; Remember, it was Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday is pool night for Superfly.&nbsp; It is also "no boyfriend night"--for superfly.&nbsp; So I meet her at the Marine Corps post and then we proceed to  The Bar. &nbsp; She decides that since she has already consumed four beers, that drinking a pitcher with me of Miller Light, would be ok.&nbsp;  Ah, the stuff of dreams. &nbsp; Anyway, I wanted to hear a few songs, and I usually always give up a dollar for each song so  I can hear them now.&nbsp;  Play Nows are basically just a way to get rich.&nbsp; I didn't hear my first song till about a half hour after I played them.&nbsp; Plus we were outside on the patio, so it was hard to even hear them at all.&nbsp; The two guys from last week were outside and Superfly spotted them right away.&nbsp; I don't think I mentioned in the previous post about last Thursday, but she had exchanged numbers with one of them,&nbsp; well actually, she had me get his number and I accidentally got the wrong number.&nbsp; Switched up the 0 with an 8.&nbsp; =\&nbsp; So he was waiting all week to hear from her, while she was calling some other guy, surprisingly with the same name.&nbsp;  Small world.  So the five of us were standing outside looking around for a picnic table to become available, when this other group of guys told us which tables were being saved and which weren't.&nbsp; Just making jokes and talking in general.&nbsp; Those are the type of boys that attract the ladies, not shy and just all around cocky, but in a good way.&nbsp; Superfly and I played a long game of  ping pong-  Sitting with the boys from last week, then getting up and standing with the 'new boys'.&nbsp;     Mr. Bigpants...     I happened to turn around while in the middle of conversation with 'Scuba Steve', and I noticed this pair of eyes staring at me.&nbsp;  He walked over, said Hi, gave me a hug and in thirty minutes we had left the bar.      -----------      sports.....     Cubbies won Thursday night against the Brewers, scoring four runs in the sixth inning with a Sosa two-run homer.&nbsp; This was number eight&nbsp;for shut outs from&nbsp;Zambrano.&nbsp; Tonight is&nbsp;game one&nbsp;of the Cubbie/Phillie series.&nbsp; With Prior pitching for the home team with a 2-2 record and Milton, with an 11-2 record, will be trying to strike out the boys from  The Windy City. &nbsp;    -----------    Dave Matthews Band    Thursday&nbsp; July 29 2004    Ford Amphitheatre     One Sweet World&nbsp;    Grey Street&nbsp;    Joy Ride&nbsp;    Dont Drink the Water    #41&nbsp;    When The World Ends&nbsp;    Song That Jane Likes&nbsp;    Hello Again&nbsp;    Sugar Will&nbsp;    So Much To Say&nbsp;    Too Much&nbsp;    Where Are You Going&nbsp;    Rhyme & Reason&nbsp;    Crazy Easy&nbsp;    Jimi Thing    __________________&nbsp;    Crush&nbsp;    The Stone&nbsp;    -----------    Word of the Day 7.30.04     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapidary \LAP-uh-dair-ee\,    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  adjective: &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Of or pertaining to the art of cutting stones or engraving&nbsp;on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

       Ah, Tuesday.&nbsp; Sometimes a day starts with so much promise - and then things don't turn out as planned, and you realize you're even better off for it than you thought you'd be.    Got into work bright and early, and found out that our bitch of an assistant manager tendered her resignation via e-mail over the weekend, effective immediately.&nbsp; I could go on and on about how she brought down all the employees she'd come in contact with, how many customers complained about her, how she had a personnel file about as thick as the OED, but really, she and all she stands for can be summarized in one word: misanthrope.&nbsp; She was on her "final warning" (which I believe is corporate-speak for "Double Secret Probation",) making her getting shitcanned at this point was pretty much just a formality, so she decided to get out on her own terms.&nbsp; Ever since the word came down, morale at the store has been through the roof.&nbsp; Employees have been bouncy, happy, smiling for no reason.&nbsp; It's like 200+ pounds of dead weight has been lifted off all of our shoulders.  The big plan on Tuesday was to go and catch the Sox-Twins game in the evening.&nbsp; It was going to be Rachel, Dan, Britt, and myself, along with whoever else we could scrounge up.&nbsp; If you read my Friday night post, you read about the strange dichotomy that is Britt.&nbsp; Well, Tuesday, the other Britt showed up to work.&nbsp; She has been fired up for going to a Tuesday night game at The Cell for months now, had her schedule changed so she could go, and now that&nbsp; it's gameday, what is she saying, in a meek and quiet voice?&nbsp; "Um, I don't know that I can afford it..."&nbsp; Well, that's not gonna stand, not after all this anticipation.&nbsp; So I go to my locker and grab one of the $1.00 ticket vouchers I bought a while back.&nbsp; I give it to her, along with a dollar, and tell her I'm driving.&nbsp; Money problem solved.&nbsp; And yet, when 4:00 comes, we're all standing up by the exit, and Rachel is asking if she's going, she's saying "I don't know, don't really have the money..." and all the time seems intently interested in staring at her shoes.&nbsp; She was so non-commital and insecure that we couldn't even get a solid "no" out of her.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Wasn't going to stop the three of us from having a good time at the ol' ballpark.&nbsp; On to 35th and Shields!  We make it to The Cell around 5:30, a full 90 minutes before game time.&nbsp; We pay to park, head to the ticket windows, and just as we make it up to the window to buy our tickets, the guy slaps a sign on the glass: "Tonight's Game Is SOLD OUT."&nbsp; Honestly, that doesn't actually happen to people, does it?&nbsp; That's the stuff bad sitcoms are made of.&nbsp; I half expected a guy with a horn standing next to the window, just so he could go "waa-waaaaaah!" for the full effect.&nbsp; So we pull out of the lot and get our $16 refunded (we almost didn't from the burly South Side jerk-off working the gate, until he realized we weren't going to roll over and didn't mind talking to someone above him to get our money back,) and decided to head a bit north.  We make our way into Lincoln Park, home to DePaul University, oodles of trendy twentysomethings, and rents I will never, ever be able to afford.&nbsp; Now, it's time for a bit of a shameful confession on my part: I am completely incapable of parallel parking.&nbsp; I know what it is, I know the steps involved, it's just that something gets lost in the execution of it all.&nbsp; Driving down in this built-up area, though, you're as likely to find a public parking lot as you are to find a herd of moose crossing Clark at Fullerton.&nbsp; And so, Dan and Rachel, being more seasoned city-types, direct me and support me as I slowly and deliberately attempt to make my way into this bastard of a space.&nbsp; I end up perfectly centered in the space and parallel to the curb.&nbsp; And no one else's car had to die for it.&nbsp; Those two - where would I be without them?  We stuff the meter with quarters and head into Papa Luigi's, a place promising authentic New York style pizza.&nbsp; And yes, there is a difference between Chicago and New York as far as pizza goes.&nbsp; Saying that pizza is pizza is like saying that the cask of Anejo tequila is pretty much the same thing as that plastic jug of "Senor Queasy's Value Tequila" on the bottom shelf.&nbsp; There is a distinct difference here.&nbsp; I tried the NYC version of stuffed pizza, which is basically a giant 16" round calzone, but crispy.&nbsp; And good lord, was it ever stuffed.&nbsp; My gigantic wedge of pizza was filled with cheese, Italian sausage (not pieces of it, but ground sausage filling the whole damn thing,) pepperoni, and ham.&nbsp; I got a breadstick to go with it, and hey - there's pepperoni stuffed in the breadstick, too!&nbsp; Filled with more greasy pork products than a person should probably have at one sitting, we headed up the street to the theater to see  Napoleon Dynamite .&nbsp; This movie didn't interest me at all and&nbsp;I had no intent of seeing it, but Rachel and Dan sold me on it.&nbsp; Once again, where would I be without those two?&nbsp; The movie was fecking hysterical.&nbsp; I'm not going to describe it or sum it up, because with a film like this, I feel like describing and summarizing can ruin the experience of some scenes.&nbsp; It's funny, silly, stupid, and downright uncomfortable at points, but the whole time it never loses its heart.&nbsp; Go see it now if you can find it at a theater.&nbsp; And thanks to this film, I now have a Halloween costume planned out.  After the show got out, we were going to head down to Millenium Park and check out all of the fuss.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there wasn't a spot to be found within 6 blocks of the park on this beautiful night, because apparently a lot of people had the same idea we did.&nbsp; We vowed to visit sometime soon, though - and take the train downtown when we do.&nbsp; And so, with the likes of Franz Ferdinand and Cheap Trick pumping out of the radio as we drove down Lake Shore Drive and the Stevenson with our windows open and the warm summer breeze blowing, we headed back to from whence we came.  We were meeting up with a bunch of peeps from work back in Orland afterward, and along with all of them was my friend Brian, in town for two weeks from San Diego.&nbsp; Brian and I lived in the same dorm down at U of I and became fast friends - and one of the days in the near future, he'll be getting a Ph.D. in astrophysics.&nbsp; He's simply the most brilliant mind I've ever met, while somehow managing to be completely down to earth and socially functional, which, if you've ever been in a college physics department, is quite the rare commodity.&nbsp; So we sat around, drank, and caught up on things, having ourselves a damn fine time.&nbsp; With closing time approaching, and me having to be at work at 8 am, Brian informs me that it's a moral imperative that we go to White Castle.&nbsp; Living out on the coast, far away from any outlet of those unique little greaseballs, the crave has hit my dear friend in a truly wicked fashion.&nbsp; And hey, what's a little more meat after the suckling pig in a crust I'd consumed earlier in the evening?&nbsp; We head to Whitey's, down some sliders (and man, does a a jalapeno cheeseburger ever hit the spot after a few adult beverages,) and call it an evening, with me finally dragging myself into bed around 2:30, my body mass comprised of approximately 12% foreign meats.&nbsp; Not every night can be like that, but when you get one, the good times kinda stick with you for a while afterward.&nbsp; Kinda like the smell that results from those sliders going through your digestive tract.&nbsp; Er, that's probably too&nbsp;much information.

       Dont EVEN ask me what that means or where it came from.&nbsp; I've just heard it a few times and it's been wondering around in my head the past few days.&nbsp; It reminds me of a drum roll.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The past few days have been crazy.&nbsp; Thursday night I met up with Superfly at The Bar, it was $ pints and I only spent $2.&nbsp; We wont get into how much I drank, Im not supposed to even be drinking.&nbsp; Anyway, we sat outside and like always, this group of people came and asked if they could sit with us.&nbsp; And since we are so nice and enjoy the company of strangers, we said of course they could share the table with us.&nbsp; Three guys and a chick.&nbsp; We all ended up talking and just having a good time.&nbsp; Before we knew it, it was last call and time to go home.&nbsp;  You dont have to go home, but you cant stay here.&nbsp;  I actually hate that saying, it just sounds geek-ish.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Friday was all in all a good day.&nbsp; Made plans to go see this band at another bar, I posted about that earlier.&nbsp; Then Saturday was the birthday party and the concert at the fair.&nbsp; Yesteryday I took the kids up to my grandmas and made plans for the week at the lake.&nbsp; Getting meals planned and what not.&nbsp; Nothing too exciting.&nbsp; I showed Av a pic of Mr. Bigpants and she seemed to be  impressed. &nbsp; Finally got the kids to bed and ended up watching  Monster. &nbsp; Strange movie.&nbsp; Wasnt that impressed.&nbsp; Mr. Bigpants didnt like it much either.&nbsp; Not really a date movie.&nbsp;  Details not provided at this time.     -----------     Word of the Day&nbsp; 7.26.04      &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;incarnadine \in-KAR-nuh-dyn\, adjective:&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.

Mencken, "Ludendorff," [2]The Atlantic, June 1917&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; _________________________________________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;    Beau ideal is from the French beau idéal, "ideal beauty     &nbsp;   -----------------------     &nbsp;   Something to think about.

       Just a few things to say I've posted today. Everyone should go  urlLink here  and download dmb playing Rick James version of Super Freak at Alpine Vally on Saturday.    It's worth the time.  I havent really been in the blogging mood, so I'm lagging behind on keeping up with this.  So yeah.   peace.

        The Cost of Kids       The government recently calculated the cost of raising a child from birth to 18 and came up with $160,140.00 for a middle income family. Talk about sticker shock! That doesn't even touch college tuition.  But $160,140 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into $8,896 a year, $741.38 a month, or $171.08 a week. That's a mere $24.24 a day! Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't have children if you want to be "rich." It is just the opposite.        What do you get for your $160,140?          Naming rights,--- First, middle, and last!               Glimpses of God everyday.               Giggles under the covers every night.         More love than your heart can hold.               Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.           Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies.     A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.                 A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sandcastles, and skipping down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.                 Someone to laugh yourself silly with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that day.                   For $160,140, you never have to grow up.                You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs, and never stop believing in Santa Claus. You have an excuse to keep reading the Adventures of Piglet and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney Land, and wishing on stars.  You get to frame rainbows, hearts, and flowers under refrigerator magnets and collect spray painted noodle wreaths for Christmas,  hand prints set in clay for Mother's Day, and cards with backward letters for Father's Day.         For $160,140, there is no greater bang for your buck.  You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a splinter, filling a wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of bangs, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always gets treated to ice cream regardless.  You get a front row seat to history to witness the first step, first word, first bra, first date, and first time behind the wheel.  You get to be immortal.  You get another branch added to your family tree, and if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called grandchildren.  You get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice, communications, and human sexuality that no college can match.  In the eyes of a child, you rank right up there with God. You have all the power to heal a booboo, scare away the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a slumber party, ground them forever, and love them without limits, so one day they will, like you, love without counting the cost.    -----------      Thought I'd share this, when I read it I got this chill thinking about how true all of this is.  Being a parent cant be explained, its just something you have to experience.         Peace.  Y  .dmb.

       senescence \sih-NEH-suhn(t)s\, noun:  The state of being old; the process of growing old; aging.   Our own bodies are simultaneously and subtly undergoing the same inexorable process that will lead eventually to  senescence  and death . --Sherwin B. Nuland, [1]How We Die   Is there a middle ground between an obsession with aging and an intelligent commitment to a healthier lifestyle? How much time, money, energy, and angst should we devote to the fight against  senescence ?  --Tony Schwartz, "In My Humble Opinion," [2]Fast Company, November 1999   Trying to understand the factors that determine maximum possible lifespan is one of the most puzzling aspects of the overall study of  senescence  and death . --William R. Clark, [3]A Means to an End _________________________________________________________ Senescence is from Latin senescere, "to grow old," from senex, "old." It is related to senile.

        Sunkist....    Good orange soda, but also an appropriate term for what happened to me this week. My legs-front and back, my face, my shoulders and arms, my chest and back were red like a lobster. Fading and peeling now. I will also complain about my "water tubing accident". On Sunday, the first day of my vacation, I went out on the lake for some high speed, water rushing in your face type of fun. I was doing fine for awhile, holding on tight~ like a virgins pussy ~ until my dad thought it would be fun to swing me through two waves coming together from other boats  PLUS  the wake from his boat. I ended up flying off and landing in the water, not knowing which way was up. Thank God for those life vests. Other wise I might have swam to the bottom thinking it was the way to air. The tube hit the waves so hard, the outer lining came off the inner tube. Once I got back to the pier, and walked on solid ground, I was told that I flew up in the air about three feet before I hit the water. My grandma was spotting and she said it looked like I did a cartwheel in the air. She wouldn't spot the rest of the week, nor would she even watch anyone from the shore. Pretty scary stuff I guess. But it didn't stop me. I went back out on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Monday and Tuesday were rough because I still had a stiff neck and shoulders, plus the sun burn. All in all, the vacation was much needed and well worth the minor problems. FYI-the keg was gone Friday afternoon. I was surprised it lasted that long. But it only meant we had to go buy more beer for the weekend.   I       much to young to look that good....    Along with all the adventures, Friday brings most of the regulars on the lake. So around noon on Friday, two guys, I guessed they were about 17 or 18, walked to the ski doos that were next door to our cottage. Started to take the covers off and got them ready to take out onto the water. I was just looking, enjoying the view for the time being and my aunt says,"That one has some muscles." I just laughed. I was still thinking that they had to at least be  legal.  Later on that day, my uncle was getting the fire started and he asked one of them how old they were.        15!!     .......end of story.          good ole' war movies and some eat....    I came to the realization that a man, well, at least my dad, cannot go a whole day without some type of war movie and a good meal. If those two things aren't part of his day, cravings start to rear its ugly head and everyone fears Pops.            ~  peace.  Y  .  dmb  ~
