      This section is for Mind Control and Alien involment. Doesn't matter if you believe me or not i just need a place to collect this stuff for review and maybe others will find it useful too. I guess we should start with the technology that we have that could cause what is happening to a lot more people than you might think. This link covers a variety of weapons that are published.     urlLink  http://raven1.net/uncom.htm      These are weapons that have been published so bear in mind "they" (more on the they part later) have much more advance than this.

       My Private Nation : lyrics 									 									   When I Look To The Sky    When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye     And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won’t seem to let me go     Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you’re here with me And you make everything alright And when I feel like I’m lost something tells me you’re here with me And I can always find my way when you are here     And every word I didn’t say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn’t dance before And every sunset that we’ll miss I’ll wrap them  all up in a kiss And  pick you up in all of this when I sail away     Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it  is  impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me When I am hoping it won’t pass me by    And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me

        Time After Time    1983   by C.Lauper and R.Hyman       Lying in my bed i hear the clock tick, and think of you caught up in circles confusion - is nothing new Flashback - warm nights - almost left behind suitcases of memories, time after -  Sometimes you picture me - I'm walking to far ahead you're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said - Then you say - go slow - I fall behind - the second hand unwinds   Chorus  If you're lost you can look - and you will find me time after time If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting time after time  After my picture fades a darkness has turned to gray watching through windows - you're wondering if I'm O.K. secrets stolen from deep inside the drum beats out of time -   Chorus  If you're lost...  You said go slow - I fall behind the second hand unwinds -   Chorus  If you're lost... ...time after time    time after time    time after time    time after time  Life patterns seem to be repeating irl and in the virtual world.   urlLink  http://www.imho.com/grae/chaos/chaos.html       It states in part     The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen. Or maybe one that wasn't going to happen, does. (Ian Stewart,  Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos , pg. 141)      I read Chaos-A new Science by James Glick  urlLink    urlLink  http://www.around.com/      I was totally amazed. The solar flares are what is going to be the end of the world IMO. It also speaks of how people can have a life pattern, if the perps alter this life pattern just a little then what would have happened in your life may turn out totally different.  When I was 28 I had an "affair" with a  co-worker. We had know each other for three years, and the fire was so hot I don't know if we could have stayed away from each other or not. The affair lasted 6 months. My husband found out and he and a friend of his went and beat him so badly he was in the hospital in critcal condition. We were moving out of town at the time and I didn't know about it until later. I also know he was having an "affair" at the same time I was. I put "affair" in quotes because as it turns out, he had not divorced his first wife so our marriage was not legal. When he did get the divorce some 15 years later the Texas courts declared our marriage legal. Big whoop. I have had this life pattern repeat itself many times, short of the affair, I don't want anyone else to get hurt. Sex is just not worth having someone you love get hurt. I strive for the platonic. Not easy for men but some do transend and they are very dear to me. Something in the eyes, some kind of chemical attraction that gets amplified to mind boggling heights. Currently I am experiencing this on the net. Wierd, but at least noone gets physically hurt. I wish I could have told Crito these things. It's the Chaos theory,IMO,  that are implementing in this particular life patten.

      It's my birtday and I'm feeling depressed. Music also has something to do with the MC I think that the cosmic concisiousness is affecting the artist in the world, either that or Rob Thomas is TI. I think I'll just put all the lyrics that come to mind here rather than on the mindcontrol board.  3. BRIGHT LIGHTS By R. Thomas  SHE GOT OUT OF TOWN ON A RAILWAY NEW YORK BOUND TOOK ALL EXCEPT MY NAME ANOTHER ALIEN ON BROADWAY  THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THIS WORLD YOU JUST CAN'T CHANGE SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T SEE UNTIL IT GETS TOO LATE  BABY, BABY, BABY WHEN ALL YOUR LOVE IS GONE WHO WILL SAVE ME FROM ALL I'M UP AGAINST OUT IN THIS WORLD MAYBE, MAYBE, MAYBE YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING THAT'S ENOUGH TO PLEASE YOU BUT IF THE BRIGHT LIGHTS DON'T RECEIVE YOU YOU CAN TURN YOURSELF AROUND AND COME ON HOME  I GOT A HOLE IN ME NOW I GOT A SCAR I CAN TALK ABOUT SHE KEEPS A PICTURE OF ME IN HER APARTMENT IN THE CITY SOME THINGS IN THIS WORLD THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE SOME THINGS YOU DON'T NEED UNTIL THEY LEAVE YOU AND THEY'RE THINGS THAT YOU MISS  (CHORUS)  LET THAT CITY TAKE YOU IN LET THAT CITY SPIT YOU OUT LET THAT CITY TAKE YOU DOWN FOR GOD'S SAKE TURN AROUND   4. UNWELL By R. Thomas  ALL DAY STARING AT THE CEILING MAKING FRIENDS WITH SHADOWS ON MY WALL ALL NIGHT I'M HEARING VOICES TELLING ME THAT I SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP BECAUSE TOMORROW MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING  HOLD ON I'M FEELING LIKE I'M HEADED FOR A BREAKDOWN I DON'T KNOW WHY  I'M NOT CRAZY I'M JUST A LITTLE UNWELL I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T TELL BUT STAY AWHILE AND MAYBE THEN YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME I'M NOT CRAZY I'M JUST A LITTLE IMPAIRED I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T CARE BUT SOON ENOUGH YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF ME AND HOW I USED TO BE  SEE ME TALKING TO MYSELF IN PUBLIC AND DODGING GLANCES ON THE TRAIN I KNOW I KNOW THEY'VE ALL BEEN TALKING 'BOUT ME I CAN HEAR THEM WHISPER AND IT MAKES ME THINK THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME  OUT OF ALL THE HOURS THINKING SOMEHOW I'VE LOST MY MIND  (CHORUS)  TALKING IN MY SLEEP PRETTY SOON THEY'LL COME TO GET ME THEY'LL BE TAKING ME AWAY

      August 4,2004 As this seems to be something I keep get distracted from I will just post when I can..  The Alien part is tricky, my fav  urlLink http://www.alienjigsaw.com/Part_IV/pomintro.html     This link discusses the Open Mind Project a quote from the introduction that I can totally relate to.   "I'm                not sure what is worse: to believe that you have been abducted and                experimented on by aliens from another planet, or to suspect you                have been abducted and experimented on by members of your own species.                Perhaps it is easier for us in a psychological sense, to suspect                that we have been abducted and experimented on by aliens because                in some strange way, we can excuse aliens for not understanding                our customs and for not "knowing better."                   When I heard                my first story about a person who believed they had been experimented                on by members of our government, I thought I had heard it all. To                me, this story was more unbelievable and more bizarre than the stories                I had heard about alien abductions. What this person said was, they                believed they had been exposed to microwaves from small black boxes                that had been placed on their property by secret agents of the government.                They said they had been beamed by microwaves as part of a secret                government experiment. I discarded this information as coming from                someone who was paranoid and didn't give it another thought. During                that time in my life I knew nothing about our government's experimentation                on American citizens."       In my research to find out what is happeining to me I found familiarity in this, My father spoke of alien abductions. He was in the Navy, graduated from the naval academy November 20th 1945. I mention the date because he died on November 20th 1997. I believe he was probably government abuducted, though it is possible to be both an alien abductee and a government abductee. No wonder he went insane. There were, and are, a lot of MKULTRA programs going on at the time. UFO sightings were also on the rise during this time frame according to Part One The TimeLine.                        urlLink
