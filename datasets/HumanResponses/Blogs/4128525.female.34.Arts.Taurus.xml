      Friday eve after work I drove to New Hampshire.  It was my first long car drive in ages.  I almost turned around twice!  I started thinking 'what if I need to go to the hospital?'  'what if my car breaks down on this dark road...and I need to go to the hospital??'  Then I felt my chest tightening up-- was it panic, or was I going to suffocate?  And driving whilst popping xanax is probably not a good idea.  But I eventually chilled out, and made it to my destination.  Was visiting my friend J. from highschool.  Her life is getting very Twin Peaks up there.  First I met the girl she met by making out with her at the bar a few weeks ago.  Then we went to the basement of the bar with her, the barowner and some other guy to smoke weed-- this guy had HUGE buds with him.  Then I met her other friend--ex stripper porn star w/ 2 kids and a 19 year old boyfriend.  We had a cookout, more smoking of the herb, and  meat on sticks.  The brother of ex strippers boyfriend was there.  He's going to become a trucker soon.  He introduced me to the term 'Lot Lizard'  the ho' of the trucker world.  The brothers are from a small town in Maine where there's nothing around.  I asked what people did with themselves up there, and they said 'drugs'.  Then 2 teanagers came over, and we smoked up w/ them.  Now I know why J. is getting high so much!  It got so cold at night we had to light a fire.    Saturday we went to some antique stores--my favorite activity up there.  I bought my usual crap and found a nice bad art painting.  Maybe I'll figure out later how to put them up here.  We also sat on a boulder at this beautiful lake, and there was NO ONE THERE!  That does not happen outside in NYC.  The ride back was good.  I didn't panic, so I think I conquered that irrational fear.    Today I got a transvaginal sonogram!  It was weird cuz the girl I sit next to at work got a sonogram earlier that day, but she's pregnant, so I'm sure that makes it alot more fun and  you get cute pics with it.  Mine was to screen for ovarian cancer.  Grandma got it so I suppose its a good idea to check.  The first part of the sonogram was ok, except for the feeling I was going to pee all over the table-- They want you to have 32 oz of water before they sonogram you.  So he put the jellly stuff on my lower belly and did his thing, and I thought that was it.  Then he says, 'you can go to the bathroom now, then we'll do the other part'  ?? what other part.  So he did check my kidneys, then he pulls out this big wand and tells me I'm gonna insert it you know where.  I didn't know I was in for all that!  What a mess.  I had that freaking jelly stuff everywhere.  I'm also looking for a roomate.  The 2 people I was going to see cancelled on me-- I'm sure going out of town when people can see places didn't help.  So I saw this guy J. tonight.  He sounded super aggressive and annoying on the phone.  He was the person I was least excited about meeting.  Then he said he shared a dog w/ his gfriend and would  have it a couple weeks out of the month.  Sounded awful!  But then he said it was a 12 lb.  french bulldog-- with the smashed in faces.  And that it didn't bark, it just snorts, and it sounded so cute!  He came over and seemed alot cooler in person-- he works on the floor of the stock exchange, lived in Japan for a couple years, is a big surfer/snowboarder (why do I always meet these types?)  but he seemed pretty cool.  I'm supposed to see a couple people tomorrow, but I think this guy might work.  Maybe he can introduce me to a nice investment banker  ;  )

      So, i've been on quite a journey the last few months.  I got Mono-- epstien barr virus.  This thing is probably a piece of cake for the usual teenagers who get this.  For me, a 34  year old, its been a complete nightmare!  The diagnoses came right before my birthday, May 15.  I've had swollen sore lymph nodes in my neck and armpits, rashes, spontaneos gum bleeding, white tongue, burning tongue, burning skin, tight chest, panic attacks.... I've been running from dr. to dr. freaking out about my symptoms, and they've done nothing but tell me I could use a good shrink and tranquilizer.  I did take their advice.  Xanax is pretty cool.  So today I've started working w/ a naturopathic dr my coworker recommended, so we'll see how it goes.  I just bought or was shipped a shitload of supplements...I got Lomatium dissectum, some kind of antiviral.  Some pills made out of a few different mushrooms, enzyme immune support pills, flaxseed oil, a recipe for a shake to make every morning.  I'm looking forward to seeing what this does-- hopefully it will do something.  I do feel alot better than I did last month, but hey, it can't hurt to see if I can get in really good shape.  After this we're gonna look into any yeast components to the way I feel.  Once I figure out how to put links on this thing, I'll hook you up! In other news, I'm looking for a new roomate.  Last one is hitched now-- thats a whole other story.  Was really excited when a nurse was interested in moving in!  But she never called back....oh well!

      Hopefully this blog will inspire me to do more things, thus having something to write about, and use my brain, which I generally don't like to use.  I usuallly don't like to talk about myself much, so we'll see if I can get into a me me me mode.  Or it could be my observations on things.  My job consists of me spending 8 hours a day w/ a computer, so nothing too exciting there.  We'll just have to see what happens.
