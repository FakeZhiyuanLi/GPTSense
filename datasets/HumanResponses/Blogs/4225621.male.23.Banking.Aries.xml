        On August 1, 2004, was born Emily Ann Reyes Conway, the first daughter of two of my most closest firends at work. I didn't have oportunity to see her until this weekend, and Gosh! she is the most beautiful baby I've ever seen... Both, Charly and Alicia, the parents, are happy, the just don't beleive they already have a baby at home, a baby of their own... 
 I hope I can keep closer to them in the future, and they let me witness how their child grows...

       I just felt I needed to do something about my life. I've never been too drunk or too drugged (drugged? Actually, not at all). I've been working since I was 15. My father and mother already passed away. I barely have friends, and somehow, stupidly, I just let
them go.I like being alone, but I also like to feel there's someone there, just for me.What to do about an empty life filled with dreams that I know wont bring
something good at all....

       It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place...Except you and me.So set 'em' up joe, I got a little story,I think you should know.
We're drinking my friend, to the end of a brief episode.Make it one for my baby...and one more for the road.
I know the routine, put another nickel in the machine.I'm feeling so bad, won't you make the music easy and sad.
I could tell you a lot, but it's not in a gentleman's code.Make it one for my baby...and one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet,and I've got a lot of things I'd like to say.And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me, till it's talked away.
Well... that's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin'anxious to close.Thanks for the cheers, I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear.
But this torch that I've found, it's gotta be drowned,or it soon might explode...Make it one for my baby... and one more for the road...
