      So, it has been a while since I have added to this.  I do not like posting what I eat on an everyday basis.  It bores me and I am sure you.   So I have eaten out a couple of times in the past week so here is my break down for you.  Please bear with me while I shape this blog into something worthwhile.  I promise by this time next week I will have more fancy things on her like links and all that.  If you have dummy instructions on how to add and links of neatness to this blog, please e-mail me.  Friday 10/10/03 I worked at eastside there where bands playing.  I can not remember the name of the opening band but I enjoyed them.  One of them was House of Large Sizes, which I must say where amazing.  The bass player was so fun to watch.  She had braided pigtails and bounced around a great deal.  I must say the lead singer reminded me of Ted Leo in a weird way.  I think it was something with his vocals.  People always tell me that I end up being reminded of someone who has nothing to do with someone else.  Well, to me in my head it works. The drummer reminded me of Dominique from Flickerstick.  Flickerstick was the winner of VH1s bands on the run.  Which was a funny and entertaining show.  It was on Sundays at nine (I know Sundays the time I am fuzzy on) I would make sure I never missed an episode.  I would cook a big dinner, do laundry and cuddle.  Sometimes drink.  I can not say why the drummer reminded me of Dominique from Flickerstick.  Maybe because they where both drummers and it was the drumming style that was the same.  They look nothing alike.  When I was all done at eastside I came home so hungry.  I put the dogs in the kennel and hopped in the car.  Headed out on 1-70 and drove to Dennys in Kingdom City.   It was really nice outside cold, dark, quite and about three in the morning.  The drive was short maybe because I was driven by hunger. When I arrived there, the nice white trash looking lady (aww the Midwest) let me pick where to sit.  I love that, it makes me feel so special and even better I get my way.  The white trash looking lady came over.  She was fucking perky.   I ordered a hot chocolate and a water to start.   The hot chocolate came it was not to hot or to cold the temperature was great.  However they did put whipped cream on top, which I find gross.  When you stir it up the whipped cream at first is a big hard lump (it looks like something you would not want to drink in your hot chocolate) because I tried to stir it.  When you first dunk the whipped cream, it just kept getting harder.  A couple of stirs later I have nice hot chocolate with no signs of whipped cream.  Next time I will ask for no whipped cream.  I think they put that whipped cream on to rip me off from the hot chocolate goodness I want.  She came back and I ordered a veggie omelet with wheat toast.   The food came rather quick.   I do recall a cop coming in while I was waiting for my food.  He did not eat just came by to say hi.  I was glad he did not stay.  That way all the other tables in the non-smoking section where empty, I enjoy that.  No one can hear your conversation and you are not stuck hearing anyone elses.  My omelet was warm with the nice ripe and warm tomatoes, which are great.  I love warm tomatoes on food.  The omelet did have more mushrooms than I would have liked.  I have this thing with mushrooms, they remind me of brain slices.  It is hard to eat a lot of them when you think of brain slices.  I swear they look just like them.   There was a documentary I watched on how they archive famous historians brains.  They are sliced up and put in between two sheets of glass.  Well the mushrooms remind me of Albert Einstein brain (which is the one they pulled out to show the TV).  Other than the abundance of mushrooms my omelet was good.   The hash browns where greasy and crunchy at the same time.  Oh Dennys how do you do such things.  The toast they had pre-buttered for me.  I guess I gave the impression that I wanted my toast wet with butter.  I hate soggy toast, we are all old enough we can butter our toast on are own, thank you very much.  Dennys over all was clean, free of bad doers.  I give it a B.  If I did not have to drive out of town to eat there the rating would have been higher.  Did you hear that?  Rich people of Columbia, we want a Dennys back.  10/19/03 On this lovely Sunday I checked my mail.  I had received a magazine from AAA.  I never really look through these but today I did.  I get a discount at Pizza Hut.  Then I got hunger.  So I went off to the Pizza Hut on Worley.  The waitress sat us in a booth, which makes me happy.  There was only one other table with customers.  It was quit, a little bit dirty.  I scanned around and noticed to wipe the tables down more would have been nice.  Everything seemed to either have grease, or pizza sauce.  I ordered a Pepsi, and a veggie deep-dish pizza with a small order of breadsticks to start.  When ordering I asked the waitress her preference between garlic bread and bread sticks, since both sounded appealing.  She said the garlic bread was the best.  Well since she was oily and messy, just like the restaurant I went with the breadsticks.  I sat and waited.  The breadsticks came to the table.  The breadsticks where good but, hot.  They burned the roof of my mouth Good but, hot.  We scarfed them down.  I ate the most.  He he.  Finally, the pizza arrived.  It was good, swarmed with mushrooms on my second slice.  That was disgusting.  Really, in one bit the pizza had about five mushrooms.  After that horrifying experience, I woofed down the rest.  I would have to say the Pizza was good.  Over all it could use a good mopping at Pizza Hut.  I will have to give it a C.  10/20/03 Yesterday I went over to Buffalo Wild Wings.  When I first walked in to Buffalo Wild Wings I smelled spicy food and beer.  What a great smell.  I went and sat in a section; to bad it was not the section of Bridget.  If you go to wild wings she is the best.  I ordered potato wedges and beer right off the bat.  The food was fast and, so was the beer.  My wedges could have been a little warm but the beer helped.  I finished my food fast for me, had another beer.  My waitress had to leave so I lucked out and Bridget came to help.  My tummy was still in need of food so an order of onion rings filled the spot.  I also had another beer.  We had to be out by eight for other events of the night.  I was sitting and waiting for the check, all those beers where catching up.  I ran off to the bathroom.  I must say the soap is great smelling and the restroom clean.  When I came back I had the bill so I paid and left a nice tip.  Sometime from when I arrived and left the place became packed.  Never go on a Chiefs football night.  The beer did help in ignoring the stupidity that was around me.  I left a nice tip and made it home in time.  If you have not eaten here then go.  They have trivia and hot sauces.  Bridget is the best waitress.  The place is clean and has known bad smells.  They also have the big beer table draft things.  That is kind of cool.  I have not ordered one... yet.  The food is always the same, good.  The deserts look not to applying but over all it is a good place to go.  I give this an A-.

      Okay back from lunch and my trip to Walgreen's. Walgreen's is a big thumbs down when it comes to finding food. They really didn't have anything that was vegetarian and low in fat. I ended up with a big bottle of Evian Water and Bold Flavor Chex mix. I must say when I buy food I don't like it when the place has a bad stink. It smelled like wet ass. This isn't very appealing to shoppers and it made me not want to eat! I would think that companies would want things to be pleasant so you would spend more money. Someone please fill Walgreen's in on this. They also had those very tasty Halls Vitamin C Cough Drops. Those are good for sick people you get your daily allowance of vitamin C and it's a cough drop but, even better it taste like those Orange Cosmos from Sapphire Lounge. Over all, the Walgreen's trip was C-. The smell was bad and the food selection left a lot to be desired. Maybe I'm just pissed my new prescription was $25.00. Yes that is right $25.00. Damn them.   For dinner I will be having a griller with no bread (I really need to go buy some food) with a little bit of Chocolate Milk (I prefer the Prarie Farms brand not to chocolaty but, not wussiefiend either). Tonight I'm out to Eastside so before it gets to busy I will be in need of a snack. So I'm planning on either buying some pokey sticks from Gumby's or some chips and guacamole from El Rancho. The pokey sticks aren't healthy at all. Really I should stick with fruit. It's hard now a day to have healthy eating habits. One thing I have noticed since I started this journal yesterday is it helps me to keep on track. It also makes me crave new foods I haven't tried before.   Today's recipe is my knock you on your ass slushy. (After all it's Friday)  You will need the following  1 Can frozen Lemonade  Ice  And a fifth of Vodka   Place enough Ice in the blender until it reaches the top. Put in the Can of frozen lemonade (I prefer Minute Maid) Next I use about half a fifth of Vodka. Feel free to use more or less. Blend until nice and slushy. Enjoy!

      So I did make Chimmiechongas last night.  The food was very good and yummy. I used grape tomatoes in them.  So I was told this was a little boring.  So if anyone knows how to spice this up let me know.  This weekend I’m going to be going out to eat.  I’ll do this at least once a week and review the place and food for you.  Is that nice of me?  If you feel the need to provide me with some money for this just let me know.    For lunch I have to run to Walgreen’s so when I get back I’ll let you know what good food options they have.  I am a little scared about it.  I think the reason I like food so much is first I’m always hungry.  Second when I upset to chug a beer and eat some fatty foods makes me feel a lot better.  I’m really hungry right now.  I would really like a beer too.  It would make me smile to have one and the chocolate mousse from tellers.  This weekend I’m watching the short list thing on MTV2.  And I will be snacking while I do it.  I imagine I will eat triskets and salsa.

      Back from Lunch.  Lunch was great. I had baked potato with a morning star griller with no bread.  I also had a big, glass of chocolate milk.  Now, I know your asking how did I manage a backed potato in an hour lunch.  Here is what I did I walked it let the dogs out.  Scrubbed my Potato put it in a plastic grocery bag.  Wrapped it up but, not tight.  Stick it in the Microwave for about six minutes, while that is going on I turn on the oven.  Take aluminum foil and put in my griller with lots of Barbeque sauce.  Let the dogs in get their Eukanba all ready and some milk again.  Then the microwave beeps and I take out the potato (it is hot) wrap it in aluminum foil with my special better, parsley and this wonderful thing called grinders.  Which is a garlic and sea salt mix that you grind up.  You can purchase this for 3.99 at Village Wine and Cheese.  So then I put the potato in the oven.  Sit down while my dogs hunt down a cricket.  (On a side note can anyone please tell me why they kill it then rub themselves all over it?) Wait a while and take out my potato that is all done and yummy with my nice and tenderly soaked in barbeque sauce griller.  Get my big glass of milk in my favorite cup. Which by the way is a Cardinal cup from a game.  Not a bad lunch huh?  For dinner I’m making chimmiechongas.  What I do is by the morning star crumbles heat them up in a pan.  Cook my Mexican rice in the microwave.  Take some fresh veggies and throw that in with the rice then add my crumbles.  I put that all in Fat Free tortillas add some salsa either Hot or Medium.  Fold it up and brown it in a pan to make it stick together better.  Then I bake it in the oven for about 20 minutes.  I do ad part skim cheese to mine.  I just use a small amount of cheese.  If I change my mind about dinner I’ll let you know tomorrow.    One thing I would like you all to do e-mail me any and all recipes that have garlic and are vegetarian.  I’m always looking for something new to try.  Have a good dinner.

      Okay, so this is all about food.  Well let’s start with yesterday   10/8/03 Breakfast, I had about 4 liters of water at the least and.  Yummy!  I worked through lunch.  So, I had Ritz chips and water.  The Ritz chips are too salty don’t even waste you money or time.  If they weren’t so damn salty I would’ve loved them.  Someone needs to call the Ritz people and tell them to lay off the salt.   Dinner I had these yummy banana muffins I had mad the night before.  They are fat free! And the butter I had is called smart spread. The American Heart Association approves it and it is very good.  Of course I had some more water.  My dogs had Eukanuba dog food with Milk on it.  They went nuts.  After all that I went down to eastside and had Bud Light.  Yummy beer.  I love beer.  So, then some of us went down with Sal to That new Sapphire lounge.  I had two orange martinis.  They are very good.  For all you who are afraid of martinis get the Orange ones.  Lindsay had a Raspberry one that was so gross.  Then she got that blue something with less rum and she loved it.  Lisa had a Sapphire one very dirty.  Which I found out means extra olive juice.  She liked that a lot.  Then the two guys had Those Blue ones again.  I just know has weenie puffers.  Then I went and had more beer.  All, night I was craving pizza, popcorn and pasta.  I didn’t end up eating again.    10/9/03 Breakfast, Well, it is Gardetto’s and Fiji water.  The Fiji water is awesome.  See, its not bottled water like aquafina is its Natural Artesian water.  I 	also enjoy the natural spring waters like Evan.  Regular bottled water is okay.  I hate deja blue it’s very gross.  Don’t waste your time with it.  The Gardetto’s are the Special Italian Recipe and very crunch.  I regret eating this for breakfast.  I really want a banana.  Oh well, it’s almost lunch anyway.    Now, for all of those food lovers out their go to this website http://www.recipezarr.com It is very good.  They rate recipes and everything.  My personal highest rated one is my knock you on your ass slushy.  Other things that are good their 100% yummy banana bread is awesome.  This is honestly the best recipe site  Okay, I have a question for all of you.  Mexican rice do they really put animal fat in it?  If so please e-mail me and let me know milojonheather@homtail.com I can’t handle it if they do.    Well this is it until I eat again.

      Well, Kids I have been busy to busy to eat so sorry there isn't much to update.  Tuesday 11/18/03 I know this one is a about a week old but, it still counts damn it.  So, on this lovely day Jon and I went to El Maguey's.  We started with eating a large amount of chips.  I was informed at this point that Jon's friend Mike puts huge amounts or salt on his chips.  I must say I advise against this to anyone who is thinking of trying this.  Salt is not something to fool around with.  It will make open soars on the corners of your mouth if you try to eat to fast.  Just say no to the salt on the chips.  Okay, I feel much better that was really bothering me.  Some times you just have to vent when it comes to food.  If you have anything you feel needs venting I'll eat and then vent all the bad feelings right out.  I promise on the holy Betty Crocker Cookbook.  Now, back to my Lunch at El Maguey's.  We where seated in a corner (yes) and the fatty waiter came over.  I didn't know what to get, so it took me a while.  Jon ordered something with eggs and hot sauce, which sounded puk-a-rific.  I ordered a pork burrito minus the pork, so it just had veggies.  I also asked for no goat cheese.  I think asked the man about the rice.  Jon kept saying "does the rice have animal lard on it?"  I was much more refined and asked them man "Does the rice have animal products on it?" Either way he didn't understand so I said  " Do you put animal fat on the rice?" He understood that and said "No" So, I then had a side of rice too.  Everything was wonderful but, Jon was getting a Negro Medla and I wanted a Margarita so he went to get my ID.  I waited my food was brought to me.  I poke at it once, and then I cut it a little.  Holy Fuck they thought I wanted Pork ONLY.  I was about to puke.  I pushed my plate away and waited.  I waited for what seem like the time it takes to fall asleep after you just woke up and ran a mile.  The Fatty came back.  I explained no meat I don't eat meat I just wanted the vegetables.  He and I where having what you call a..a... ah, yes a communication problem.  So, he called in for re-enforcements.  Then came over this gentleman with silver caps over his teeth.   I couldn't stop staring and wondering how he polished these.   Finally after bout 10 minutes with silver cap they realized what I wanted.  So, I explained that I wanted veggie's only and no goat cheese.  He (silver cap) said it's just white cheese and he didn't know what kind.  This was alarming that they new so little about the food, so I asked for it on the side.  The fatty seemed pissed and mad that I didn't want to eat that pork thingy.  God it looked like something my dog craps out.  He then threw the plate in the gray buckets that they have.  He was more of a Drama Queen that Susan Lucci.  Two seconds later he went back to that plate removed the fork and ate the food.   How gross not only is he eating something my dog crapped out but think of the germs.  I was so upset by this event that UN folded in front of me that I went to the ladies room.  In the ladies room (if you can call it that) the floor was wet all over.  You had to hold your breath out of the fear of breathing in some sort of chemical concoction they made in there.  Some how the pictures had water stains and were discolored.  The all had a blue tint about the same hue as toilet bowl flushers.  The first stall someone had taken a massive shit and some how missed the bowl.  I'm starting to think that the fatty is really a woman.  After such a disturbing experience I come back to the table to see Jon with his food and beer.  His food had re-fried beans.  He had made it clear (or so we thought) no beans.  So they took it back and brought out my new food and his non-bean food.  I told Jon about the pork and all about the bathroom.  Ahh thank God my Magrittia is finally here and boy did I need it.  I ordered the 27oz. one and it's was so yummy.  Jon's food is cold and not hot or spicy.  Mine isn't too bad but as we are eating and talking about how it would be funny if you could leave negative tips because the serves was so bad.  As we sit and laugh about the serves and enjoying are drinks a thought crosses are minds.  "Did he really tell us the truth about the rice? Maybe he didn't understand. NO" So, we stopped eating the rice.  Further investagtions is needed and my stomach can't handle the truth at this point in time.   Over all I would say what a let down.  I can't even explain how bad the service was or, the horror of the bathroom.  It seemed just like a nightmare that would never end.  Well, I'm really hungry and I'll add more lately.  I will be reviewing my Step Mom's Veggie thanksgiving for all of those who are can't wait for another one check back on Friday.

      Lets, just get right to it. Okay?     Friday 11/14/03  I went home and had beer and Italian Village pizza.  Now, I love their pizza, I really do.  It was very good.  Sometimes the artichokes make the pizza soggy but on this night it wasn't the case.   Well, after dinner and beer I went out with Lindsay and Lisa.  This night was a bit ridiculous.  I made a very big decision:  From Friday on I wouldn't put up with any shit from those frat guys.  I'm going to get that mace that Sal told me about and if anyone calls me a cunt again that is what they get.  Other than that event the night was good.  After we left Eastside Tavern and the Ramada Inn parking lot, McDonalds sounded excellent.  My stomach was a little upset at this point and I thought food was the answer.  Isn't it always?     Well, about 6 o'clock in the morning I woke up with the worst stomach pains ever.  It was... the pizza.  I was sick all of Saturday.  Not good!     Saturday 11/15/03  So I was sick.  Oh what fun times.  So, Jon helped out a great deal on my day of illness.  He and I bopped over to the Olive Garden (warning this review is not for the PG crowd) for dinner.  First we give our names.  I spot some seats in the packed with people waiting area! Right on.   It was really crowded and I was happy to sit down, what with the stomach cramps I'd been having.  Little did I know that we would be graced by a celebrity.  Yes, we fucking had one sitting right next to us.  I didn't know Harry Potter was real until that moment.  I felt so blessed.  Kid was obsessed. Right down the striped shirt and everything.  Well, after the rug rat left,  the ugliest people started pouring in.  This one hostess had on the most god awful watch I had ever seen.  When I saw this pink, rhinestoned square that took up about half of her lower arm, I almost bolted.  Really if the people make you gag, what is the food going to do?  I already wasn't 100% food ready. After what seemed like an eternity, we were seated.  The table was good, small and in the corner.  Little did I know some psycho girl would be staring at me through at the whole dinner. When I go out to eat I didn't know it was so others could watch. She was really creepy but, I'll get into more about her later.  My first notice is damn, it's fucking cold!  Good thing I wore a shirt, sweater and a Men's Navy pea coat.  I had my little green thumb monster to entertain me while this waitress tried to figure out if she should help us.  It was so nice and wonderful when she finally came over.  I was thirsty and wanted my damn water.  We ordered.  We waited, and waited.  Finally Breadsticks show up! Only three though, what do I look like an anorexia case? I want to fucking eat and I want to now! She also decided to ruin my day by informing me that they were making fresh salad and it would be a moment.  So I eat my one bread stick (because Jon was more hungry than me) and waited.  Finally the salad!  I start serving it out to Jon and then myself, We unroll the silverware and to our surprise, dinner is here. WHAT THE FUCK!  Salad and dinner at the same time!  How, How? Damn, lets just say I'm pissed. That is putting it nicely.  So, I eat the salad- not bad.  She brings back more breadsticks.  I take a bite of my orginal breadstick and it tasted of pure garlic and seasoning.  My mouth thought for a moment I played a mean trick and that there wasn't bread.  All I tasted was grainy seasonings.  Right when this happened it burned my mouth.  I was unaware that over flavoring of garlic and who knows what else burned your mouth.  Where in this hell was my warning label?  So, I finally start into my Pasta and tomato dish.  I am noticing at this point and so is my thumb monster that this annoying girl keeps watching me eat.  Every time I look up she is staring.  At this point she is now smiling at me!  What the fuck is wrong with her?  Do, I have a horn on my head or something?  Really, lady you are ruining my mood.  My reaction to the first bite of pasta  is "oh my god they serve this to people, and want them to like it". At this point the Salad is the best thing.  Remember, it is fresh.  So, I give my self another plate of salad.  By this time it's the bottom of the bowl.  Much to my surprise fresh salad seems to mean brown, old lettuce at the Olive Garden.  That is good to know next time, I'll ask for the old stuff and see what happens.   So, the breadsticks are a wash and so is the salad.  Back to the pasta.  With each bite it slowly begins to taste a little better.  It's growing on me, kinda  like mold grows on cheese.  This lady who is our waitress is horrible when it comes to refilling my water.  I finally take all I can get of this meal, it's time to go.  At, this point I have all of the buttons on my coat buttoned and I notice if hell is the hottest place imaginable, then Olive Garden is the complete opposite of hell.  It was North Pole in there.  The waitress brings the check.  The staring girl is still staring.  My thumb monster is ready to go and I don't blame him.  I grab an Andes Mint and take a moment to notice the best food of that night was the fucking mint.  The place was loud, full of fools in black and gold with cat ears, temparture was bad, wait staff was revolting... Overall I would say it sucked.  It was one of those dinners where all you do is laugh.       Sunday 11/16/03  No, this doesn't deserve a full review but, here we go.  At the Mall Christmas shopping.  Oh joy!  Nothing puts you in the spirit than the Olive Garden rejects and their idea that they can run you over!  This day was wonderful.  Still, not 100% as far as the stomach goes and I have people thinking that we are reenacting Days of Thunder.  So, after lots of diving I was hungry.  What a surprise.  I saw the cookie place,  Great American Cookie.  First my mom's are better, so there.  Second I notice they don't have a nutrition fact sheet (but, do I really want to know) Third, on of the displays of they wonderful cute and edible cakes they make is a pig, can you guess what the pig is eating?  Time's up, it is saying pig out!  Doesn't that really make you want to eat it?  It is taunting me telling me I will becoming fat just like the others in line.  I say fuck the pig, fuck them all and I order a double doozie.  Now, I know your asking "What in the world is a double doozie?"   Well, pull your panties out I was just getting to that.  A double doozie is two large cookies filled with frosting.  I ordered a chocolate chip one.  It was good and tasty.  The soda I had (I know slap my hand, soda = bad) the girl (yes, girl because anyone this stupid can't be a women) filled my cup to the top with crushed ice.  Do you know what happens when you fill a soda cup to the top with crushed ice then put Coke in?  You don't? Well you get two sips of coke out of a medium drink, isn't that fun?  Over all I would say don't get sodas at the cookie place, don't date the workers at the cookie place, it is best if we all just stick to the cookies at the cookie place.     Crap, now I have that song "who stole the cookies from the cookie jar?" stuck in my head.  Today will be long, I can tell but, rewarding I have potatos at home.

      Well, my little cupcakes it's been a couple of days are you hungry to hear what I have to say.  Oh of course you are.  Tuesday 11/11/03 This day started off normal.  Work, comomusic, work then school.  I had a test that I thought I would fail.  My thoughts now are that I did wonderful.  So, to celebrate this wonderful thought of doing well on my test, Jon and I went to Pizza Hut, the one on Clark lane.  I ordered for us both.  We had a Veggie deep dish minus the black olives.   See, way back when I had my gallbladder I would get sick if I ate cheese or black olives.  You can just imagine the tragedy if I ate them at the same time!  Watch Out!  So, back to the food, I also ordered breadsticks.  I ate so many of them I thought I was going to die.  What made this dinning experience all the more special was that the waitress treated me like a child.  It was really funny.  Then I was scared for my life when the thug employee's started blasting some beats.  I had to run for my life out of there.  Over all it was a good food and scared for my life atmosphere.  Wednesday 11/12/03 For this wonderful evening I drank for the first time in 6 Days.  I went to Buffalo Wild Wings.  The potato wedges and onion rings where so good they where to die for.  I ordered it with Medium sauce and ranch.  I like hot and spicy but to me that is medium.   One thing I have notices is the Bud Light tastes so good here.  It was brought to my attention that it's probably because it came in real glasses.  Finished the food and beer so, we trotted over to TP's on Rangeline for some laugh's and free popcorn.  I had one more beer and popcorn.  The beer was good Bud Light in a bottle.  The popcorn however was black and cold.  Those are two things I never what to see when it comes to popcorn.  It was like eating blackened, rotting teeth.  Something you just don't want to do.   Later, when I got home and made some good popcorn and finished my new movies Serendipity with John Cusak.  Then off to bed and start dreaming of dinner for tonight.    It's almost time for dinner so I better wrap this up.  Talk to you all later.

      Friday 11/7/03  Lets see, Oh yes.  I was sick on Friday so I stayed at home and rented movies.  I rented Charlie's Angels II and Gacy.  Gacy was a scary scary movie.  It really freaked me out.  He ended up having 29 bodys under his house and four he threw in the river.  He took advantage of and molested over 2000 young boys.  Good, thing I ate before I saw this flick.  There was scenes with maggots and crawling bugs...  YUCK.     My feast on this moviefest was Gumby's Pokey sticks.  This time I had a larger order and boy did I pack that shit away.  They didn't give me my extra ranch, though.  FUCK.  Despite that trauma, it was still enjoyable.  I noticed, however, three days in a row of Pokey sticks makes your tummy grumbly.  All in all good food once again.   Saturday 11/8/03  For this day it was my 6 year friend Anniversary with Jon.  We've always done stuff on this date to celebrate our friendship.  So, to start the celebration, we headed over to Flat Branch, one of our all time favorites.  He had pizza.  I had pizza but to start we had pub fries.  I really packed those away.  They where lightly seasoned fries with ranch dressing.  They where to die for.  As, I said earlier we both had pizza.  I don't remember what kind he had but, I'm sure it had mushrooms.  If you have been reading this then you know how I feel about mushrooms (brain slices).  One word yuck.  So, I had the pizza that had pesto sauce, roma tomoatoes, and garlic.  I subbed mozerella for goat cheese.  I find goat cheese to be slimy, I think I would rather eat a whole jar of mushrooms than goat cheese.  I find it to be vile.  When they brought out my pizza it had extra big garlic chunks.  It was so good.  I ended up only eating one slice because I was so full from the fries.  So, I took it to go.  I must also take this time to say Flat Branch use to have the best smelling soap.  For some reason they changed it.  I know this a tragedy so if anyone can fix it please let me know.  The place was very clean but cold when sitting over by the windows.  So, watch out don't sit by the windows no matter how nice it is to stare at them while they make the pizza's.   Later that evening  Jon and I went to Tellers for one beer and chocolate mousse for me.  When I eat this mousse the whole world goes away. I could die will eating this and not even care.  It's a wonder that I'm not a fattie with the way I can pack that shit away.  It is truly a wonderful experience.  I sugest you all try it.   Even later than on in that evening I bought some garlic herb cheese to go with Ritz crackers.  It was very yummy the brand of this cheese is Aulette.  I believe.  It is a good 3:00 in the morning snack.   Sunday 11/9/03  I slept well over twelve hours so I was feeling pretty good.  I didn't do my hair or make up so I was quite a sight.  I had this wonderful pasta dish from Outback steak house I belive it's called wahala or some shit like that.  Well, anyway it's fettucini with alfredo sauce that is spicy.  It comes with snow peas, carrots, broccoli, and yellow squash.  It was so good I stuffed my self silly.  Oh, oops I forgot to mention the pumpernickel bread and the baked potato too.  Oh my was it so good.  I could die.  Perfect date for me would be this for dinner and off to Tellers for the choclate moussee.  Damn what a day it would be.  The poato was a little on the small side but who am I to judge after I stuffed my face full.  I still have left overs too!     Later that evening I had a large chocolate shake from Steak n' Shake.  This made me long for Zip's or Zesto's.  If anyone is aware of a good chocolate shake in Columbia, Please let me know.  It was your normal shake nothing to write home about.     All this food talk is making me starve.  I want some Kettle Corn Damn IT!  If anyone knows where to get Kettle Corn please don't hold back. That shit isn't fair.

      All, I have been doing since I last updated this is drinking.  So, sorry I don't have very many food updates for you today.    Wednesday 11-5-03  I ordered some pokey sticks and went to eastside and I had those with some beer.   The pokey sticks come from Gumby's they are like cheesy breadsticks if you didn't know.  Well in the middle they where soggy.  Which I found hard to eat since they where dripping with some sort of liquid.  I swear they cheese was wet.  I am guessing water or oil.  Either way it doesn't sit well in my stomach.  It did mix with the beer well.  This guy at the bar brought some food in for BC and he sat next to me, well he smelled like food all night.  I started thinking maybe this is what guys should do to attract me.  Go cook something and come by I bet I'd like that.  Oh and bring the food.  That night was a total shit fest.  I sat at eastside from 8-12 and didn't even get drunk.  I didn't get home until 4 or 4:30 and then I had to get up at 6:30.  God, what a waste of a night.  But, at least the food was good.    Thursday 11-6-03  I went home took a shower had some popcorn and watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  So, it's about 8 o'clock and I'm bored so I head out.  I went to Tropical Liquors at the downtown location.  Had some popcorn and beer.  Got hit on by some guy that is double my age.  Then I hoped over to Shattered to meet Lindsay and Lisa.  This is about nine o'clock.  I had beers got hit on by more guys double my age.  So, to cheer tummy and myself up I ordered some Gumby's Pokey sticks again.  They where better this time.  I ate about half of them.  One thing I noticed at Eastside that is way different than Shattered is that they love food too.  I think those guys sit around and talk about food more than girls, or at least when I am there.  So, back to my pokey sticks.  They got cold quick but I imagine that has something to do with the weather.  I didn't think they drove down but maybe they did.  I should've asked.  Well, I didn't even finish those.  I drank, and drank then went home.  Another night just like all the others drink and creepy old guys hit on me.  I am wondering what is wrong with this picture.    Well, tonight is going to be way different.  It's already been determined.  I will be ordering some sort of yummy food that I'll tell you about on Monday and renting movies.  Awww I love the movies.. mmm... I'm getting hungry.  Well, time to go make some popcorn.

      Hello, Everyone.  Listen, I went to Shattered on 10/29/03 and asked for my orange cosmo.  The lesson learned is; don't go to non-martini places and ask for one.  It tasted like pineapple, which makes me have drive heaves.  Oh, I can still taste it.  Despite the crappy taste, their effort to try and make it was nice. I will now stick to beer when at Shattered.  Friday, 10/31/03 I had two of the orange cosmos that are very yummy.  I had those at Sapphire Lounge. Lesson learned once again:  If I drink two of those and a couple of beers, I don't really remember much of what happened.  The cosmos were very delicious.  I find that the more I drink of these things and the more I go to the Sapphire Lounge the more I like it.  It's also making me forget my chocolate mousse.  I am taking this moment to say I now like Sapphire better than Tellers.  Wait, Tellers does have that one quiet waiter or it did in May.  Okay the jury is still out on which one is better.    I also was at eastside.  I really think this place could benefit from popcorn.  One pleasant surprise was when I walked into the girl's room on Wednesday, it smelled like flowers.  It was really really nice.  However, the smell and blue water was gone by Thursday.  I think the lesson here is that this place gets 2000 flushes in a matter of  days.    So Saturday I ordered some nice Italian Village pizza.  It arrived to me in record time.  I had a medium pizza with Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Green Peppers, Onions, and Tomatoes.  This pizza is to die for.  Or at least in my world.  So, Sunday I was off to Quinton's with Lisa.  I had never been here.  I was excited to see a tree-huggers spud.  Guess what?  They where out of potatoes, how fucked is that? How the fuck do you run out of potatoes, they are cheap!  I wasn't happy.  So I ate salsa, chips and cheese.  The cheese had that oh-so-gross layer of crust.  The salsa, well, I have never seen salsa look that way.  It was runny and chunky at the same time.  But, despite the looks the food wasn't bad.   I did, however, make the huge mistake of ordering an Orange Push.  YUCKY- that sums it up.  If I ever tasted girl juice I think that is how it would taste but, with pineapple thrown in.  There was 100% no orange taste in it.  Over all I don't think I'll be going here again.

       Oh no don't eat this shit!    Today in the spirt of the Holidays I'm going to name the top ten food sins.  These are the foods no one should ever eat!    10.  Mushrooms   How in the hell could anyone eat anything that resembles brain slices?  Really they are all squishy in your mouth it's really gross.  Plus how could you eat fried whole pieces.  I find this very gross.    9. Canned Vegetables  I find the idea of vegetables quite appealing.  However when they are floating in a liquid that resembles human piss it is revolting.  Please people don't be cheap buy frozen.  You'll thank me later.    8. Bologna   Anyone who is over the age of five and eats this stuff please run outside and stand and wait for a car to run over you.  I think that sums it up, you all know why this shit is nasty so why buy it and even worse why force it upon your children who you say you love.  Is this some sort of sick revenge because your parents did it to you?    7. Lunch Meat with green and yellow things in it   Even worse than number 8 is that lunch meat that comes with pickles or olives or cheese or whatever the package says.  This is very unnatural and very sick.  The idea of meat (if you can call it that) with who knows what packaged with it.  Come on everyone you know better.      6. Hot Dogs with cheese in them   Okay Hot Dogs in general are gross and I admit I've eaten those sick things.  So what is with the ones that come with cheese are you to lazy to put cheese on it?  This food is repulsive if you cut it open and look at it.  PLEASE JUST SAY NO!    5. Raw Fish   I could be naive on this one but someone please explain how this is healthy?  The idea of uncooked meat or little eggs that look like mice shit in my mouth that is enough right there to give me food poisoning.    4. Odd Animal Parts   So, I don't eat meat but there is still something stomach turning to most about the idea of eating cow tongue or eyeballs and lets not forget to mention the male organ some eat.  These things aren't normal not in the US so just throw them away we waste everything so lets keep with it and not eat odd animal parts    3. Yams   Whether you call them Yams or Sweet Potato's it really doesn't matter they should just refer to this food as trash.  I find this orange potato to be a major disappointment.  We have wonderful spuds to choose from so why settle for the freak of the family?  P.S. everyone don't think Sweet Potato Casserole is something we enjoy.  Marshmallows and Potatoes what drugs  were you on?  Give me some and I'll probably run for President, win the Lotto and eat this shit.   Come on this should only be eaten in a need food or die situation it should never be a choice.    2. Mayonnaise   What Fattie came up with this big jar of lard and made everyone think it's socially acceptable to want this shit.  Then to eat it in public?!  My first job ever I worked at Wendy's and when people ordered extra mayo, I would try to put so much on that they would never want to eat it again.  America your fat because of the Mayo not even Light Mayo is healthy just throw it up if you ingests it.  Stick your fat finger down your mouth.  You'll thank me in the morning when your ass looks less fat.    1. Pork Rinds   Yes we come to an end Pork Rinds.  Pork Rinds must have been invented by some football, redneck fan on crack.  I think they can sum up what's wrong with the world;  We search for junk food at cheap prices.  I wouldn't even feed this shit to my dogs.  What's even worse is that we now have wonderful microwavable pork rinds?  They pop up when you cook them.  They come in spicy too.  How nice - lets over-process something that is already gross and stink up the work places.  Right now I'm passing a Law that if you catch anyone with Pork Rinds please do them the favor of ending their life.   Thank You!   Next to come: Top Ten Dishes to eat in Columbia, Mo!  It's time I tell these people where to eat and what to order.

       Here is the break down of top ten junk foods   This blog is not being grammar policed so just deal.  10. Caramellos Nothing starts of the list like caramel (which can't be hard must be creamy) and Chocolate  9. Snickers Isn't this everyone's favorite?!  8. Twizzlers I love to eat this with Root Beer... I wonder how it would go with Bud Light?  7. Boston Cream Pie Oh buy it at the store or get someone to make it for you.  Either way I'm coming over to steal it.  6. Pizza Sub Category best pizza in Columbia (top 5) 5. Imos 4. Pizza Hut 3. Gumby's 2. Italian Village 1. Shakespeare's Can't go wrong with Pizza especially good veggie shit.  5. Ice Cream As you'll see below my top ten Ice Creams.  I'm kind of on a break with this stuff it tends to make me feel fat.  4. Breadsticks If anyone knows me they know how I crave this shit.  It's either Pokey Sticks or Pizza Hut.  Really it's healthy I swear.  Bread (it's a grain group) Cheese (Dairy, DUH!) Maranaria (Veggie Group or would Tomato be fruit?)  I think I know what I'm having for dinner  3. Movie Theater Popcorn I will drive to the Hollywood 14 walk in and get this shit to go.  Haven't they learned of a drive thru yet?  2. Chips n' Salsa I love this shit with cheese.  Maybe I'm half Latin with the way I want to eat it.  It goes great with beer.  1.  Kettle Corn This is suck a rare treat for me.  To eat the stuff that you see them make not that shit you can buy at the store.  When it's warm oh my I think I busted my pants thinking about it.  That is the All Time Top Ten Junk Foods of all time, subject to change depending on my cravings.

      Well, Last night I went to Flat Branch, I eat their way to much.  It is always pretty good, and this time was no exception.  First Jon and I where seated near the smoking section.  It was no biggie since the smokers weren't smoking.  I new what I wanted right away but, I still looked at the menu.  I found out they have new menu's and I don't just mean reprinted but, new items.  I was so happy my pants got all wet.  Well, Jon ordered some sort of new pizza they had.  I had roma tomato and garlic (I asked for no mushrooms!) with mozzarella instead of goat cheese.  There is just something about goat cheese that grosses me out, maybe it's they taste and the slimmy factor?!  Well, we also ordered french fries to start.    Jons pizza was new and weird, really strong herbs where used.  It was okayish.  I would never order it on my own.  It did have an amazing tomato taste that was mmm.. I'm getting so hungry thinking about it.  Boy did those get woofed down.  The waitress (Amanda) never let my water glass get empty, she was amazing.  I also ordered extra pesto sauce and it was thick this time.  Everything was perfect.  This is the best service I have ever had.  One, of the best trips to Flat Branch!  I have to go back again tonight left my shoulder bag! FUCK!

      Everyone I have died.  I haven't been able to eat food in over a month.  No I'm kidding.  I'll have some sparkling reviews for you all soon.  First I must say. I'm very upset with Quinn Snyder for the crap he is pulling. If he is.  It's bullshit to pay these college people just to win. FUCK FUCK FUCK.  My whole world has been falling apart lately. With Quinn, work is crazy, in a wedding, Christmas shopping  I think I need a beer.  I haven't been out in about three weeks.  I'm losing my mind.  My reviews to come are Bancok Gardens,  Step Mom's thanksgiving, Wedding food, and mmmm I-Hop  Okay, I guess it's not fair to make you wait.  Last night around 8 I went to the "hop" and ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and pancakes.  My lovely dining partner Jon ordered some gross thing that I don't like.   Jon please fill in what you thought.    His  had mushrooms and eggs yuck.  So this waitress sucked some mean dick.  I mean she couldn't leave me alone for fucking five min. To think about what I wanted.  So, finally this fucking fatty waitress brought my food.  I thought I had ordered eggs with cheese not cheese with eggs!  I've never had eggs so grossly cooked before.  I could puke right now thinking about it.  OH god the horror.  Jon woofed his down before I got a bite but, I did steal his griddle cake!  So, as we are fishing up this lady came in with a voice that would give Fran Dresher a run for her money.  Oh was it hard to eat when she was complaining about the snow.  Yeah everyone in snowed move the fuck on.  So I soaked my pancakes with strawberry stuff... mmmm.. Tasty.  I woofed it down so fast due to this ladies fucking voice.  Over all I would say I-Hop was pretty normal.  Stupid people, food was blah, price was good.  I would go their again.  and you should love the "hop" too.  Now, as I said I'm in a hurry oh I didn't well you fuckers should've known that.  I heard Jason was missing my reviews so here you go that was for you.  Enjoy!

      Well, here I go and bitch and complain mean while  urlLink Jason  did come through for me.  So, this is where I tell you a little bit about Jason my first guest blog buddy.  He loves music and gets bored all day.  Thankfully when I am bored he is there to help out.  His blog is updated way more than mine and he always makes comments (I love for people to do that).  So read below and check out his blog it's worth going to daily trust me I know...  Nightshift at the Kentucky Fried Chicken - Resident Jason  When I was in high school I took a job at the local Kentucky Fried Chicken. It was decent cash for a high school sophomore. I got free food and soda. We (Clint, the owner's younger son who was the same age as me) listened to Bad Religion, Screeching Weasel and NOFX all evening (except when I worked with the owner's elder son who insisted on "Workingman's Dead" by the Grateful Dead. To this day, I can't stand the Dead).  I was banned from the drive-thru speaker after being employed there for only two weeks when I welcomed customers to "Kentucky Fried Children." Hey, I was fifteen and bored on a Tuesday night. Not finding the humor in it, the owner placed me in the back with the flour and the fowl. It sucked ass. Making the chicken wasn't so bad, but making the cole slaw was a bit arduous with the chopping of cabbage and all.   Like any business, you'd get your regulars. There was the old guy who ordered three original recipe legs (with extra grease). The overzealous soccer dad who wore the same gray coaches shorts - no matter what the temperature was - always order a 21-piece extra crispy dinner - no thighs, no legs, no wings, no fun. This forty-something, housedress-wearing lady used to come in one a week, order a 15-piece family dinner, a 32 oz. Diet Pepsi, and sit and eat the whole thing. She always left one of the six biscuits untouched. We would inspect the bag after she left because we couldn't believe one person could eat all that. Sure enough, those bones were picked clean. I always felt guilty afterwards like we were making fun of her. It's not so much that we were making fun of her, as it was just utter shock and awe we felt that one mortal could eat so much in one setting.   Completely off the subject here, but what's with the super-sized diet soft drink? I've never understood this. It appears to me that a lot of over-weight people will order the fast food with the highest content of fat (I'm generally standing behind them in line preparing to order the same heart-attack-waiting-to-happen food, so I know this) and then offset it with a diet soda. I don't play those psychological games with myself. Never have. I'll go with a Dr. Pepper (which contains zero prune juice, according to the Food Network special on this nectar of the gods) where available. I will settle for a Coke as my second choice.  Back on the KFC tip, I fondly look back at my life in the fast food lane and can't help but get a wee bit misty-eyed. I'm serious. The old guy is most certainly dead. The soccer dad most likely has shrinked his order down to a three-piece dinner for one, as his annoying, sports-are-my-life demeanor has to have gotten to his wife by now. What about the 15-piece dinner for-five-but-eaten-by-one lonely, overweight lady? She is the one I find myself thinking of the most.

      I know it's been a while but I've been waiting for  urlLink Jason  to send me his guest blog.  He hasn't yet so go to his blog and tell him I want my guest post.   urlLink Jon  moved me down on his link sidebar tell him that is total bullshit.  What he has no love for food now?  Well, I was bored and I found a great website for all of you fatties that still want to eat fattie food but loose some weight.  Here you go..  urlLink click it  you can check out the calories and other things about your favorite fast food places.  In non food news.  Guided by Voices was cancelled, and Jon is going to dj at Shattered tomorrow.  My life has been dull and my whole not eating out but one day thing is keeping me from reviewing places.  I will have to cook something.. Maybe...  maybe Jon will cook for me.

      It's 2004 and I'm as lazy as ever and haven't updated shit.   Lets start with December 31 2003.    I went home after work changed into better clothes.  I let me cutie dogs out, Ava and Milo.  I then walked in to the kitchen and heated up this salsa and cheese thing that a I created.  It had cheese from the jar for the bottom layer then I fucked up and dumped in sour cream (isn't that a food sin ruin your tasty dinner by dumping gross sour cream on it?) the next layer was hot salsa (Jon likes it so hot it's gross)  for the next layer I put on more cheese then medium salsa and finished it with lettuce and shredded cheese.   So that salsa thing is heating up in the oven while I'm sitting back drinking some Bud Light.  I woof the dinner down and the beer.  It was wonderful.  While I'm in the middle of scrubbing.  Jenny my sister shows up (who by the way hasn't e-mailed pictures from that night) she looks at my food like it's disease.  So she's hungry of course I'm still hungry.  Jon walks in next  he's wanting beer.  So, I give him my debt card and send him off to the store.  Mean while Jen and I order Pizza Hut cheese breadsticks and 2 litter of Pepsi.     Pizza man comes, Jenny and I are quick with stuffy are faces.  In walks Jon with my beer, oh wait he didn't buy Bud Light  he bought Boulevard unfiltered wheat!  He tries to tell me they are all sold out.  I find this hard to believe but let it go since it's beer.  Jon finishes off the rest of the food.  I must say I find this beer very delish.   I am tipsy and cut Jon's hair and do Jen's make up.  I did a ton of sparkles on her face and on mine.  I get a call from my other sister Rachel.  I am to meet her in the parking garage at ten.  I ask if she is festive, she seems frightened by this and replies that she does have make up on.     Well Jen, Jon and I finish food and our drinks (Jenny is a Pepsi person at this point).  We load up and are of to the parking garage I find Rachel and she is not festive.  I put on her bright blue and pink sparkle eye shadow also a shit load of Bee's Wax in her hair.  She also got pretty girlie barrettes.  We are off to Shattered FINALLY!!!   Well, it was your normal night I guess.  This is the first time I ever went out.  Rachel was drunk and dancing with the Tommy Hilfiger guy that I growled at when we first walked in.  Later Jenny was getting doubled up on by two Mexicans.  I had some tall ass mother fucker trying to dance with me and boy did he get rejected.  Jon well he was drunk and didn't dance that much.  I was dancing with Jen and this girl plowed into me and acted like nothing happened so I elbowed her.  Bitch turns to me and says "There is no need for elbows"  I reply with "this is how I dance"  I continued to flap my elbows around like I was a chicken.  I did it nice sharp and hard.  She backed away and started staring I said what and she left.  I hate it when rude people bump into me, especially when I'm drunk.   Jon's brothers where their, Adam and Andy.  It was great to see them.  It seemed like it did years ago.  I had a lot of fun talking to them.  Andy even danced with me.  His brothers are great guys but no girl better hurt either one of them.  If I see it I think I would have some words.   When they did the count down Jen pulled out her phone and they time on her phone said 12:15 so I don't really know when midnight came but I was blowing bubbles and jumping up and down.     We left the bar I think when they kicked everyone out.  I'm not really for sure.  I do know that we went to I Hop later.  This was going to be my first meal of 2004!  It would set the standard.   Well,  at I-Hop we give our name and wait in the colder part.  In walks these six old people 3 grammy's and 3 grappy's.  The women where whining.  The men where groaning and sucking up to the cop.  A big bench fills up inside and the women go in and the men stay and talk about how they are getting some.  Like before I eat I want to hear about how 60 year olds are talking about humping!  So they are seated way early, I go in and talk to Rach and Jen they say one of them is the Aunt of Josh Kroenke who is an MU basketball player.  That they lady was going on how she was related to Josh and shouldn't have to wait.  If that isn't tacky enough remember we are at fucking I-Hop for shit sake!  So this one guy comes up the name taker and it turns out that they lovely party of old fuckers took his name when they called out "Green" so they could get seated earlier.  That poor guy and everyone else like me had to wait an extra ten minutes because some tight ass old bitch didn't learn in kindergarten to wait her turn.  FUCK RICH OLD BITCHES!!!!   So, finally I am seated everyone orders.  I get a veggie omelet.  Jon get's this one skillet that always makes him gassy.  Jen got French fries and Rach ordered never ending pancakes.  The food comes and it is gross.  I remember almost falling asleep because I was so bored and tired.  The waitress if you can call her that never filled my water.  We saw her only 3 times at our table.  I love that shit the waitress's do when they fucked up and hand you your bill and say things like "I hope everything was good" or "have a great day"  trying to kiss ass at the end is fucking dumb.  It only ticks me off.  Well, Jenny my sister is a wateriess so out of pitty she got a good tip.     My first meal of 2004 was a veggie omelet from I-HOP.   One thing I kept wondering and still am were where they veggies.  All I could taste was cheese.   It is what you would expect to get at I-Hop at 2 in the morning.     That was my New Years.  First time I went out and I'm going to do it again, maybe next year I'll eat at Denny's instead.

I mean look at Bush.  Is he really human?  I think not...  I would never let someone of his moral standards impregnate me.. I can tell you that right now.    Gross now I have to shower..

      So it's a Monday, yuck!  For my birthday I woke up feeling very loved.  I had a yummy I-Hop breakfast and good company.  I love getting spoiled every now and then.    Well, I also had my first night at the shat.  It went really well, I had so much fun.  Becky and her guy Eric went down with me.  I made about 50 dollars, which isn't to bad.  Adam was so sweet and would check in and make sure I'm doing okay.  He even told me he loved me as a sister.  It was so sweet and unexpected it made me and still does make me so happy and loved to think about it.  Today at work my sister Jen sent me a dozen pink roses for a late birthday surprise.  I thought that was so sweet.  I love my family.  I consider Adam and Andy family, I wish I saw them more but hey that doesn't mean I don't love and care about them.  I'm in a great mood... only a couple of things could make it even better.

             you are hotpink  #FF69B4         Your dominant hues are red and magenta. You love doing your own thing and going on your own adventures, but there are close friends you know you just can't leave behind. You can influence others on days when you're patient, but most times you just want to go out, have fun, and do your own thing.  Your saturation level is medium - You're not the most decisive go-getter, but you can get a job done when it's required of you. You probably don't think the world can change for you and don't want to spend too much effort trying to force it.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz         So Jon over at  urlLink seethruskin  did this little color thingy.  I must say I think his matches him.  I don't know about mine but I do like the color.

      MMMMMMMMMMMM...... That is all I can say about today.  I feel so loved.  I come in to work to find nice pretty decorations, a package, flowers and food!  What more could go right today.   I feel loved.  On another note.. I have to go to the gates of hell, better known as the DMV.  I have to renew my license.   I don't want to take another picture.  I have eye bags.    Last night was okay.  I just laid around and did nothing.  My little Ava was so cute all night.  She was just cuddled right up next to me.  I love cuddles even from Dogs.  Who invented this thing cuddling?  I think they should get a Noble Peace Prize or something, because if everyone just cuddled 24/7 we wouldn't have War.  Everyone would be to happy.  Imagine Osama Bin Laden and W. Cuddling together.  See they don't seem so evil know!

      Well, last night I had softball practice so I missed Angel.  I went to drink with Becky, Tina and Marsha.  It was funny.  Tina and Becky are really nice people.  I was surprised when I got home and found someone waiting for me.   I love surprise visits. It is so sweet.  It just perked my little bad mood right now.    I wish I felt like this everyday.  It's funny that when people do things you don't expect it cheers you right up.   It makes me want to make everyone feel better.  I love today.  For the first time this month I'll looking forward to my Birthday.  I hope it's a nice lovely day.   I have to work down at Shattered on Saturday and I'll be all alone.  So if you are in town come down and tip well.  It would be a nice surprise.  In other news...  Looks like my hunt for a 1 bedroom is over.  Now I might be moving into a 3 bedroom.  I'll be living with Becky and some friend of hers named Matt.  I don't know how I feel about living with a guy but, I like the idea of keeping my dogs.  I will have to think about this more.  I mean living with a guy I've never meet could be odd.  I hope he would be downstairs so then Becky and I could share the upstairs.  The place is nice and I have no clue as to how much a month.   I just don't know what to do.  Everything is changing and changing fast I wish I had one stable thing right now.  Well I have my shitty spelling and grammar... But it is more of a pain than a comfort

      So,  It is pouring outside.  I spilled cappuccino all over my shirt, it soaked to my bra.  I feel scared.  I have to go to the Doctor today at two, I don't want to go.  Tonight I have to go to shattered for my training.  I am now the Saturday night shot girl.  Speaking of Saturday it is my Birthday.  I normally get all excited and happy but, this year I feel a big fat let down this year.  I mean why should I care when know one else does.  I'm not trying to complain but, when I try to help others and they don't do shit in return it doesn't make me to hopeful that it will be a good day.  My sister Jen, is the only one who has anything nice planned for me.  It's just a date on the calendar but, it's a date in which I'm going to be 24.  It's a date where everything is suppose to go my way and I should feel loved.  Every morning for 3 weeks I wake up look at my phone see the time and date and groan.  I'm dreading getting hurt and disappointed.

      So I'm back at work from this weekend.  I would say over all it was blah.  I had good times (cardinal game) but mostly bad/ frustrating times.  I hate waiting on people.  I hate being disappointed over and over again.  One day things will get better.  I always feel like I'm in a glass bubble and everyone else isn't in one and they are all laughing at me.  Sometimes it's like someone is half way in my bubble and I think they are their because the want hang out but it turns out it's to laugh.  None of this makes sense and I don't really care, basically I'm saying I wish I felt like smiling again.  I wish more than anything that the things that made me happy would make me happy again.  I'm tired.. tired of feeling this way tired of getting older and getting shit on tired of worring.  I wish I could be 5 again.

      First thing is first.  I watched the first episode of the last six for  urlLink Angel , I must say it's getting rather good.  Fred is currently a demon, who Wesley is trying to save.  Gunn lost his super smartness and is now in a hell deminsion.  Lindsay is back and Eve is all wet again.  Speaking of Eve she got her ass kicked out of the little crew, her replacement is an ugly man.  What a drag.  Angel learns that the senior partners are setting up the real apocalypse and all this stuff with firm is to distract him.  Angel gets mad and is all ready to step it up now.  I hope that on the final episode Cordie comes back.  I heard Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't coming back as Buffy for it, that fucking sucks.  The CD's that I bought last night where...  1. Cursive  urlLink Burst and Bloom  This CD fucking rocks.  The first, second and last track are controlling my life.  It makes me want to leave work, leave town find Cursive and rock out.    2. Cursive   urlLink Art is hard  This is a CD single with Art is hard which is off their amazing  urlLink Ugly Organ  album.  It also has an unreleased track called Sinner's Serenade.  This song is worth paying four dollars for.  Well unless you can burn it from someone.  The lyrics on this song amaze me.    3. Le Tigre  urlLink Remix  Now, I really dig that Keep on Livin' song so I thought I would get more.  I didn't know how I felt about a remix album.  Well it is pure techno.  I doubt I will ever play it again unless if I'm drunk.  I bought it because it was the only Le Tigre album they had and they where out of Rilo Kiley.  4. Shins  urlLink Know your onion  Fist I must say the CD it's self is clear around the edge and it won't play in my car, which sucks.  I listened to this and like it but, I am on a major Cursive jones right now so I will have to listen to it after I get my fill of Cursive.  That is all I bought, today after work I'm going to Streetside to buy Rilo Kiley.  I need it... It calls to me.  Okay I just really want it.  J has the saddlecreek comp at his work and I really really want to listen to it right now.  I can't wait until I get my computer at home so I can burn some shit.  Tonight J is coming over and we are to rent movies.  I think I would rather play catch or do something outside since the weather is fucking awesome.  I can't wait for Saturday.  It will be fucking sweet.. Cardinal baseball that is.  Well, I still haven't had time to master these comments that  urlLink Jason  told me about.  Maybe I'll get to it until them just e-mail me at milojonheather@hotmail.com

      So, J moved out April 6th.  I made it a full week.  This is hard how do you stay in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship with someone you've been with for years now that they don't live with you.  He said he needed space.  I can respect that but looking back I have my fears that is more like looking for other pussy.  I hope I'm wrong.  I am going to try and just be patient and give him his space.  I just want to love him and hold him so much.  When I see him walk this one walk I feel like I'm floating.  He has given me that feeling for about 6 years now.  I don't /won't push those feelings down.  Most people think I'm crazy and I should tell him to fuck off but, you know what you don't give up on people you love.  Especially after six years.  I mean know one is that heartless they would sting someone along after all this time.  Well, on a more depressing note I know have to move.  Yes, he moved out but, I could still pay the rent all by myself.   Well, J didn't give the landlord rent or sign the new lease.  The landlord is made and is making me leave.  He's being nice about it.  I have a couple of months.  I didn't tell the Landlord about J moving out and I don't plan on it.   I haven't told my parents yet.   My dad and carol like him so much, I don't want them to start hating him.  I am hoping this moving apart is a temporary thing.  So, now what do I do.  I have no money.  I have two dogs and my boyfriend doesn't live with me and I have to move.  My life is starting to get a little shitter each day.    On the plus side...  okay let me think about the plus side and get back to you.

      Why is it that when two people act the same way, that they get treated differently. Life is such a fucked up thing.  I'm excited about two things.  J and are going to a Cardinals game on the 17th.  It is also my Birthday on the 24th.  I hope this year my birthday will be filled with hope, joy and everything or anything wonderful.  I'm not looking forward to very much lately.  It is boring at home, I am paying rent all by myself now and it sucks.  I'm hoping it won't be for long but, it's not my call.  I've been thinking alot about my life and what I want to do.  Well, what I want is pretty much not going to happen.  If it looks like it will stay that way I was thinking about moving to D.C.  and helping my mind out.  I don't really want to move but, when things are dramafied sometimes I think it might be easier to leave.  Maybe there will be less hurt.  I feel hopeless today.  It's one of those days where I feel stupid and ugly.  I hate my new hair cut at this moment.  I'm hoping things start looking up soon.  I mean everyone goes through some bad patches in their life but, good god.  I am in need of love, understanding and anything good.  It has to get better, I really don't think it could get much worse.  I mean realistically.    The only positive thing in my life is that I'm in love.  I'm not talking about that Jr. High kind.  I'm talking about the whole nine yards kind.  The kind where two people are the only two people in the world and nothing else matters.  The kind I had.  I feel that way,  I just have to be patient for the other person to feel that way again.  The kind of love doesn't just die.  It can get fucked up but no one can replace those feelings.

       No more leaking for me....   That is right you heard it here first.  I am moving this weekend.  I can start panting my new place Thursday night, any helpers???  Did think so.  Well that is okay.  I have no boxes and nothing packed and the couch is getting old so I hope to move ummm well Now but, I guess I can wait until Monday.  Friday I'm off to the lake for some stress relief, I really need it.  I am tired and getting more tired.. even sleeping is making me tired.  I have reached my limit of all hell breaking loose and the Gods of whatever need to fucking shine down on me!  The plus side is from all the crazy shit and stress I have lost more weight!  I am now under 120 lb!  EAT THAT!  Okay so it's barely under 120 but the point is my size 4 jeans are getting baggy.   I am hoping I don't loose the good stuff but we will see.   Other than my living crap, life isn't to bad.   I have my sisters in town and Cardinal games to look forward too.   God, I just realized how way lame this fucking blog is.  I must come up with better shit to put on here.    If anyone would like to buy me some food, I will be your friend for about 1 hour.  Feel free to e-mail me at milojonheather@hotmail.com and we can discuss where you will be taking me.  I refuse to date you, have sex with you I'm just being up front and asking for free food, please think about it.

Friday I'm off to the lake for some stress relief, I really need it.  I am tired and getting more tired.. even sleeping is making me tired.

       Food in my belly means...   Wonderful things.  This weekend has been crazy.  Drinking, working and dealing with wet carpet is my life as of lately.    Lets review the highlights.  Sunday-New Perfume it's sexy smelling.  Dinner with Adam, old Chicago has a fucking awesome pizza.  My little sister is way to cute.  Fight with my mom.  Hung over and movie watching.  I must say Colin Farrell has a fucking nice ass and I would love to grab it.  Saturday-Work, Drink, Work.  Friday-Little sleep and movie watching  That was my weekend in very little words..

       Moving day is coming...     I found a new home to live in.  My current "home" is still leaking and I have six ground-hogs.  They lady upstairs cleaned up all the water in the laundry room, which filled a bucket.  A couple of hours later it was soaking wet again.  No one has fixed the link and the mold is growing.  I'm not really for sure what to do until I move.  I can't be around that much mold.  You could get sick you know.  I really don't want to drive from Jefferson City to Columbia for a week.  The what about my dogs!  I'm guessing couch sleeping and mold for one week wouldn't kill me.  YUCK!  Other news... I'm getting caught up at work.  I am working Saturday Night at Shattered so please come by and tip me well.

       Okey Dokey Pokey...     I got home last night around 6:30 and started cleaning, hooking up my new computer and things like that.  I don't have a mouse but, I start thinking what is in that box back in the closet.  I get down on my knees and scoot closer.  YUCK!!! the carpet is all wet.  I look closer.. my lovely white pillows are now black!  I have a leak in my closet.  I go into the laundry room, which is on the other side of my closet wall.  I look the floor is all wet.  It turns out the air unit is leaking quit bad.  I then look and my pretty bookcase is all moldy... I have so many things that stink and are wet now.  I had to go get the neighbor to help me move everything.  The bookcase is to tall for my apt. and to big for me to move all on my own.  It sucked so much, to have my lovely things get all moldy and nasty.  After moving the bookcase I have this sharp pain and I have fucked up my back.  My night ended soon after that.  I was in bed by 10.  I could reach to put that bengay on but I'm telling you I would've killed for it.    Today, I worked through lunch.  Cleaned up the mess left for me at work.  I'm going to be leaving by six that is my goal.  I have to call this new guy about a place to live.  If this doesn't work out it looks like the pound for Milo and Ava.  I am trying not to think about it.    Those bitches that robbed me have skipped out on their payments!  FUCK THEM!

      Hell in a hand basket...     That is the kind of week I've been having.  I mean it's been fun but for my week of vacation.. kind of lame..  below in no real order are the highlights.  1.  I'm getting a computer and a printer... yeah! 2.  Dunkin' donuts and panera our my friend 3.  Drinking beer helps out alot 4.  Jason is good entrtainment during the day 5.  Saw a totally chick movie 6.  Fun sister time.  That is my vacation.. not totally cool but it could've been worse..  Now I'm driving from blacksburg to Columbia.. Call me if you know my number because I can already tell this road trip is going to be icky.  Having one hung over/drunk sister makes the fun part of a roadtrip a challenge.  I will also be able to AIM so do it!  See you in Columbia... I hope.

          see when people doubt you they give you power...  it's a sick game but it's true.. I like it when others doubt me.. It makes me laugh.  I love to prove people wrong.    I miss my dogs.  I wish I knew how they are.    sometimes people are so predictable.. Like clockwork. .Then when you think oh crap what that isn't normal.. Well isn't it.. You just doubted.. haha your the fool..  people are sick fucks...  the end  who needs another beer?

       Ruff Ruff    Well,  what can I say about today.  It is about 10 am DC time and I've been up for a while.  As you can see I changed my template again.  I really like  urlLink Jasons   and  urlLink Jons  I would say they have the two best.  I will be working on my for the next two weeks.. Trying to get my links going.. And maybe other nifty stuff.  Jason has been helping giving me pointers but it's hard to understand exactly what he is talking about.  I'm not stupid just html illiterate

      Well, today is another no lunch day.  I think by tomorrow I'm going to stuff my face.  I am having lunch with some friends at Bankock Gardens.  That sounds so good right now.   I'm in such a good mood.  I love getting surprises.  I love feeling light and happy, is it possible to be addicted to people?  Well if so then I am, and I don't want any rehab.  In other news Saturday I'm off to DC.  I can't wait to see my sister.  I plan to try and convince to take me thrift store shopping and record looking I bet they have good deals in DC.  If anyone knows of any place worth my stop let me know.  I feel so light and happy, I can't stop thinking about it.  I wonder if it's the lake of food?  Oh fuck it I don't care.  When I come back from DC I'll have a new computer with a CD burner!  I can't wait.

My point is every day I run this fucking and I get at least 100 more added to my total.   HELP!!!!  Sometimes I can't even open  urlLink comomusic  dude this sucks ass so fucking bad.  I'm sitting enjoying a nice vodka lemonade drink, waiting for time to pass until I go to work.  I think I might make a new rule tonight.. no more burning CD's for others until I get some in return!    I'm kind of sad  urlLink Jason  didn't e-mail me at all yesterday.  I was even bored and ready to tell good stories... ABOUT FOOD!

       my new haircut   I cut my hair again.  My dog is driving me crazy.  I really have nothing good to say.  I'm tired, hungry, and having nothing worth saying.  I'm annoyed way to often, that is the only thing that I know.  Maybe it's some sort of with draw from sleep...  I don't really know.  I hate the way I am more and more.  I just want to be happy but feel like I let everyone down.

       Jerks..   Well I worked hard this weekend and hardly have any money to show for it.  Friday I got way drunk and had a really good time.  Saturday not so drunk still a good time.  Today sucks ass.  It's fathers day and I'm not even aloud at my dad's house.  I hate men in general.  I know I work in a bar so I'll see some jerks but fuck.. if I find one men worth a shit that isn't a jerk and grabby or hits on me the minute his wife leaves.. I will clone him.. and then all the women in the world will be safe and happy...  I'm just amazed at how sheltered I've been as to not get treated like some of those and not to have seen it..  Around March I was so happy I loved my job and my life.. now I struggle to find any joy.. it's funny how things flip flop..I feel like someone took my happy life away...

       blah blah blah   It's odd when things change.  It's odd that I write this and only two people will read it.    My weekend was pretty much drama filled which means it pretty much sucked.  I had some people who where shining spots in the weekend though.  They would know who they are but I have a feeling they will never read this.  I just wanted to say Thank you for making all the drama seem not so bad.    Those drama causers.. um don't be dirty dogs.. hahaha...You know who you are you dirty dog you..  I saw a move today.  The stepford wifes.  It wasn't to bad but it's the first time I laughed out loud in over a week so that was good.  I had the olive garden which was fucking awesome.  I have now revised my who I will marry of famous men to add  urlLink Rocco  to the list.  Things I like in a man...  1. No lies 2. Thoughtfulness 3. Sense of Humor 4. Intelligence 5. Being Laid Back 6. Admitting when you are wrong/Humility 7. Manners 8. Nice Smile 9. Cooking is so sexy or being passionate about something 10. Smells good  I find that Rocco fits all of my requirements.. He is a bit older but damn for the cooking I can over look that.  Well I'm off to dream and search for other men to add to my list.  So far I only have Rocco and  urlLink Rick Ankiel .  If you know of any others I may add please feel free to send them my way.

       In ten years...    Here are the things that I won't be in ten years...  1. Over weight 2. Wearing sweatpants or stirrup pants on a daily bases.. fuck if ever 3. Dating/Married to a Republican 4. Dog-less 5. Living in Maine or some place with really cold weather  Here are things I will be in ten years...   Happy. Whatever that entails.   Mark this day on the calendar my work e-mail is down to one page. FUCK YEAH. If I have it cleaned out by the end of the week I deserve a night o' fun!  This month is filled with nothing but good. Good shows on the rise. Things are moving, changing, growing.. into this little happy pie. It's time to let go.. let go of the past.. and all the bad things.. time to be happy.. really happy. I feel good things coming.. maybe it's in the form of a new President?? Wouldn't that be the cherry on my sundae.. I'm just so happy this morning. Maybe it's the fact I'm going to go to La Tolteca. Then update my food blog!  Well they say bad things have to happen for good to happen. With the bad things that have happened lately, I'm in need of good. Last Wednesday at Midnight while I was having drinking and having fun, my Granddaddy passed away. I feel so guilty. Guilty that I was having fun while he was dying. I didn't say good bye. I didn't call. I was  to  busy... I feel like an asshole. I'm worried about my mom. I've never had someone die like this. I mean earlier my Great Grandpa died but, I wasn't as close to my Dad (his Grandson) or my Great Grandpa. Every time I smell maple donuts I think of my Granddaddy. Death is a hard thing to deal with. I wish not to dwell on the death or potential death.. I stress myself out enough and so do most. We should celebrate life and the ones that we love.
