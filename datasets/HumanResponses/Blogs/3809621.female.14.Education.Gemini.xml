      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so&nbsp;I haven't blogged in ages. Ex-squeeze me! Lol, anyway. I deserve my vacation time too you know! I was in Florida for the past week. The past few days however, I've been working on the site. I finally figured out how to work with some transparency and I got some one to code my layout. Yea, I'm lazy. Big thanks to Rage for coding it. The only reason I asked was because I could not for the life of me, get my image map working. At the rate I'm going, the site'll be up by mid-august! I seriously need to start typing up the subpages that way I can just put in the little extra touches when everything's ready. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might make a new layout. So far I've switched from Keira Knightly, to Liv Tyler, and now I'm sticking with Angelina Jolie (the woman is hot and kicks ass ^_^). I might change it only because of the fact that unlike most regular sites, my layout is taller than it is wide. It's a pop-up so it's going to look a bit 'eh...' but it's better than anything I've ever made before which makes me proud to say the least. Next step, learning CSS instead of just copying and pasting. Lol, yea I'm a&nbsp;super lazy bitch. It's not that bad either. Now, I'm going to go change this blog layout so it matches a bit more with my site layout.  &nbsp;  Massi

      So, Iframes suck and I would stop using them if it weren't for the damn fact that I'm not any good at using or making Div layouts. This sucks. I can't get my pages to open in the damn frame. I could use my alternate layout but that'd take so much work! I'm so lazy right now. Although, I have nothing better to do so it might just be better to get it over with. Lol, I might as well go try it.

      Well, I'm officially on summer break. Now I have to work on the website. It's tedious but fun work. I'm still trying to get a hang of Iframes, I need to splice the layout, and no one understands what I'm saying do they? Lol. Yeah, well I already have some of the pages written out without the HMTL coding and I need to find a hell of a lot more pictures and bases. So far, I have around 10 icons or so plus 3 blends that I can put up. I'm not sure how long it will take to finish the site but I can bet it's going to be a couple of weeks. Even if I do plan everything out.   Here's what I have set for the site right now: About Me- Bio, Stories, Poetry, Picture You- Tutorials, Resources, Quizzes Graphics- Icons, banners, tips Affiliates Feedback  That's about all I have right now.
