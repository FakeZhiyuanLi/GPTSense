       urlLink Email Hosting Packages | Canada Post Powered by Internic.ca   Canada Post does the web. It's not a bad deal. For about $8 a month I can get my domain and 3 email addresses and keep my site on the same Geocities free host. The only downside is staying with Geocities and those limitations for space.   I may do it, I miss having a real email address (not webmail).

      It sounds interesting. But I don't have the link through Blogger. Others seem to have it. Anyway, here was a  urlLink Gmail Swap  site. Maybe it will work for someone.   Yahoo Mail just went up to 100MB of space. Co-incedence?

      Reading the boards at BackWash and deciding that I should leave there once I finish making back up copies of the newsletters and columns I have written. There seems to be a two year itch for most websites I have written for. BW made it a bit past there but it's definitly showing signs of implosion now. Dying from petty back biting from inside. So, I may as well get out.   The question is... where to next? Always another adventure around the next corner. :)

      It seems I should have something marvellous to do with this space. Maybe I will work on that. Tonight I am a bit sad, a bit sorry for myself. Another boyfriend down. Is there some kind of limit to how many you can bag? When I start getting close I hope someone will let me know.   Good bye Eric. Who's next?

      Now that it's become part of Google I thought I would see what changes there are.

      I have written Bewitching Vagabond on BackWash for the past three years. But I have resigned now. Mainly due to the atmosphere on the site and especially in the discussions with site members and columnists. Things got ugly and columnists were behaving like predators, tearing into the pack animals who dared to speak about any topic. Anyway, it's not the sort of place I want to be a part of any more. Once upon a time it was great. The site owner was more involved and available. There were always friendly chats every day and you felt as if you really were a part of the site. But, for the past year I've been feeling pretty much on my own there. So, when there are so many opportunities online (especially if you don't mind not being paid) why stick with one that has gone sour?  I am looking more at Suite101. I started writing The Internet Unplugged there awhile ago. There was some turbulence but things are back on track now. I am liking it but I don't feel I know the site yet. On the plus side, for me especially, it's a Canadian site. I really do like knowing I'm writing freebie for Canadians. Charity begins at home and all that type of theory, eh?  What I would really and ideally like to do it restart InkSpot. Not with the same name, as I'm not into following someone's path that closely, but to get another really great writer's ezine out there, online. I have had contact over the years with a few great women writers and publishers. Bev Walton-Porter, Jade Walker and even the great Ms. Ohi herself (though not enough that she'd remember me).  Surely they'd like to take a stab at reinventing this particular wheel. I just wish I had more self inflicted gumption and faith in my own self. Everyone here thinks my writing is a hobby, a silly hobby,  and pretty much a waste of time. It's so hard to crawl out from under that rock. Sometimes I don't manage it and then I suddenly perk myself up and fling it off long enough to write another column, another article, another newsletter... Not long enough to become the writer I want to be. Not long enough to give myself a break and really get out there and accomplish all I want to do.  Anyway, I'm trying to adopt a writer's topic at Suite101. Not sure which one will work out, if any. But I'd like to do something geared to web writers. I have a lot I can tell new writers. So many ideas and quite a few years worth of experience now, eight actually.  Well, time to crawl out from the rock again. I'm still writing on the adult side of BackWash but it's so slow there I don't think I will stay. I would like to find a replacement for it. It's been nice having that outlet for my thoughts. I do miss old BackWash, the freewriting aspect and same for linkage. Any least little idea that popped into my head was writable and linkable. That is what I miss and what I will likely keep missing as there really isn't another site that offers that lack of focus in topic. Still, there is always blogging. :)  Happy day to you.
