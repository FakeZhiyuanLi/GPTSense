      There must have been a point in my life when I fell of the platform where most people interact with each other in honest and considerate conversations. Where your friends don't talk to you like you don't have any feelings or opinions that matter. I want to climb back up there but I can't even see an edge that I could grab onto to pull myself up.

      Save the Green Planet @ the San Francisco International Film Festival: Sticky Good Gore!  This year's festival has been anything but good. I'm beginning to think that I probably shouldn't trust the reviews/summaries inside the festival booklets. The paragraph or two will fain commentary about the film/filmmakers without offering judgment as to whether it/they is worth the price of admission. The problem with most of the films that I’ve seen so far has been that they suffer from post-production problems. The sound and camera work for Sky Blue was so bad that I thought of leaving despite the film having such a great look to it and the nice use mix of animation, CG, and real props/sets. And most of the films have been just too damn long. I don’t really consider myself an impatient moviegoer and I know films like Manhole and the Marrioner could have benefited from a tighter cut.  Anyway, Friday I attended one Extreme Cinema film showings and I didn’t have my hopes up considering the other entries in this category. Save the Green Planet is from South Korea and the premise is totally comic-book and when it started I was sure that I was going to end up falling asleep half way through. The film starts with a nice title sequence, which reminded me of the opening for David Fincer’s Seven. The lead character is a young man who believes that the CEO of a large pharmaceutical company is really an alien from Andromeda and his goal is to kidnap the alien and force him to take him to his leader so that he can prevent the destruction of the world. Characterizations in the film are somewhat typical with the CEO, a penny-pinching adulterer and the lead character a reclusive, pill-popping nerd with a homely girlfriend. But the beauty of this film is the action and interaction. Immediately after capturing the CEO the lead character begins to torture his captive in ways that make you believe he’s a sadistic psychotic (YEAH!) and of course the whole alien theory is his way of justifying taking revenge on the people who he believes have ruined his life and turned his mother into a vegetable. The torture scenes are intense and the whole sub-plot with the investigating detectives has some nice twist but the meat of this particular carcass is the cat and mouse game between the hero and the CEO. From sadistic domination to intellectual warfare this relationship provides the beats to a particularly hard-core tune. Finally the ending is a complete boot-to-the-head that reminded me why I go to these festival films. I know there’s no way I’m going to see this kinda shit in a Hollywood film.  HIGHLIGHTS: •	Combination torture chair/toilet w/ convenient lever to flush your worries away •	Death by bees for the veteran detective •	2001 A Space Odyssey homage with a twist of Buñuel

       urlLink  Carnival Collage    Funky parade with just as many freaks in the crowd as there were on the floats! The costumes were cool and the atmosphere was festive. My digital camera got just a few ok shots. I'm hoping that I got some good shots on the roll of film I shot.   The street fair was less interesting. Too much selling and not enough partying. But what can you expect on a Sunday afternoon. ;P       Viva la libertad!

       3 Day Weekend Yeah!   Like everyone else I'm now enjoying a 3-day weekend but unlike most of you I don't have to go back to work on Tuesday. So my 3-day weekend will more than likely turn into a 4 day weekend and on and on into infinity for who knows how long.  Of course at some point I'll probably run out of savings, eventually my landlord will have me forcibly removed from my $1200 a month 1-bdr apartment, and after a few centuries on the street, I'll die cold and alone curled up behind a thorn bush in a park somewhere, whispering the words "Rosebud."   Yeah, I wish my life were that predictable. Fucking Joeys have it easy. No, I'll start searching through the job postings on Tuesday, after I send in my unemployment benefits forms and I'll send piping hot, freshly baked copies of my resume to everyone I know and even some I don't know. But why worry about that now. It's a four day weekend, time to forget trails of the J. O. B. and remember the folks who died protecting my ability to slack off... eh, fuck that, I'm going to a BBQ. Ya hoo!

       Do not pass Go, Do not collect your next paycheck!   I can't believe the things I've done to this point haven't landed me in a worst position.   I care so little about so much and still I wake up...  I've tried to pray but I really don't know the words to the songs so I just hummed the tune as best I could remember.   Start over again!? eh well, ok, but this time I want to kill more people, please.

       Remember seeing this flick last Winter...     urlLink TAMALA 2010: A PUNK CAT IN SPACE   I was thinking of picking up the soundtrack this weekend but couldn't remember if I liked the music. I found this site for the film with lots of music video clips. It's a great film I recommend it to anyone with slightly DV8 sense of humor.   urlLink Great Music Clip Here!

       Samurai Revisionist Movement   Judging by the two films I've seen in the last week there's been a resurgence of Samurai picks coming out of the studios in Japan and this new fair of genre pics have taken to exploring and re-interpreting the character of the samurai and the area that he occupied in the country's history. I wrote earlier of  urlLink Twilight Samurai . Las night I watched  urlLink Taboo  by Nagisa Oshima, and was remarkably impressed with the films ability to stay true to the genre's narrative and character conventions while completely throwing a wrench in the works by examining homosexuality in an era where a man could be forced to commit suicide and/or be beheaded for the offense of borrowing money. While a militia prepares for the possibility of war a new recruit appears, his skill with a sword and stoic determination are only overshadowed by his striking beauty. At first it appears that only a few men are affected by his presence but through the narration of a lieutenant (Beat Takeshi) we hear that desires for they young man may be influencing decisions of others in the militia including himself and the revered commander. Jealousy, murder and the Samurai tradition are re-examined with a focus on sexuality and the relationships of men in a time of war. The lighting and set work in this film are great and the action and development are crafted expertly to move the story without any lags. The murder mystery is never really solved which means you'll actually have something to discuss at the end of the movie, Whoa! What a concept.    Highlights:   Another beheading, (holly-sh't I've seen a lot of these recently. At least this one didn't give me nightmares.) over-the-top and gory, just like I like'em (i.e. Totally fictitious).  Great performances from Beat Takeshi(Boiling Point,Fireworks, and more...), Tadanobu Asano (Ichi the Killer and Bright Future)  Finally, what we all go to see samurai movies for: KICK-ASS SWORDPLAY!!!     BTW: This film is also produced by Shochiku, which produced Twilight Samurai. This film is actually pretty old (2000) but of course I wasn't living in the city, where I could go to a showing of a flick that was showing for only a week, back then so I had to discover this on on DVD. I'm so glad I have a  urlLink greencine  account.

       Selfish Man Strangles Self To Avoid Sharing His Thoughts!   Wow, a lot went on this weekend but I'm not really in a mood to write about it. Not that it was bad or anything, just the opposite, I had fun. Of course I was annoyed a bit with some of the people who occupied moments of my day without making a request for my premission to touch those moments, let alone lace their fingers through them and pull them out at the roots.  Fuckers!!  Eh, well that's what happens when masses upon masses of people pile on top of each other in a pit of public festivities. At least there were just a few of these not-so-precious moments like that, that I'm seriously not going to speak of, so B the F O!  anyway, I took some good pics but of course I don't have any to post but when I do I'm sure a 1000 words will come to your mind when you see them and I'd have to hardly trickle a word of description on the page.   -johnny;j

       Totally Forgot To Mention...   ...that I saw a good samurai flick on Friday. Twilight Samurai at the Bridge theater. It's a bit slow and not your typical slice and dice samurai pic, and in fact it turned out to be somewhat of a historical drama and cultural time-capsule without even alerting you to that fact in the summary on the  urlLink website ! (eh well maybe it does but I don't read kanji so I wouldn't know.)  Anyway, if you wait around there are still some pretty good swordplay scenes and some even better corpses scenes. Overall the film reminded me of some of the Japanese period dramas that are shown on Ch. 26 on Saturdays. I've gotten hooked on a few of them and I can't really say why. I guess that's what happens when you don't have cable. (And here I thought I'd read more, tskch!)    Highlights:   Good bokken and blade action to give us an idea just how skilled the anti-hero is  Random floating corpses, which was apparently common in the feudal era (reminds me of Bakersfield)  Final battle scene in a dark interior setting, skillfully filmed and performed by Yoji Yamada and Hiroyuki Sanada(Ringu 1,2 oh and that poser samurai flick that Tom Cruise was in) respectively

      Okay,   You're in a room, tied, on the floor with a group of masked men standing behind you. What's going through you mind?  Do you think they're going to let you go?  The things that men do to men are the things that some call heroic(?!) and others call barbaric. But the pictures and the sounds tell a different story. These things are neither. It's just the oil swirling around on the surface of the soup.

       QT Don't Know Shit!   Kill Bill 2 is fun and all but man it really doesn't leave much for discussion afterwards. Both Vol's of this story could have pretty much made a interesting movie but not much more than that. I think what QandU were trying to do with this film is do some gene splicing of Samurai, Kung Fu and French New Wave flicks. I don't know if I need that much dialog and inner turmoil in my action flicks. I did like the various fight scenes and all of the death scenes were fun but other than that there really wasn't much to this series.   You know what this series reminds me of. The Jurassic Park series. Basically a Hollywood filmmaker takes narrative and characters that were explored (or exploited) by other filmmakers in Asia like 20 30 years ago and adds a big budget and a few blonde, blue eyed heroines to make it easier for American audiences to swallow. Big whoop!  That being said I did like the crawling out from the grave and the eye gouging scenes. I mean, I have my standards to after all.  My prediction, QT's next flick is going to be a rip on all the Satanist/cultist/biker flicks from the 70s. At least then he'll be taking his ideas from Americans. I'll see it.

      It's Sunday May 9th. Mother's day. I had a rough Friday and Saturday but I'm good now. It sucks the way a fog covers me up sometimes and I don't have the energy to get out of bed for anything other than to shit and shower. Good thing I have a dog otherwise I wouldn't have stepped outside of my apartment at all this weekend.   I managed to call some people including my mom. I really didn't want to but I new that if I talked to anyone I'd realize that it's just another day, like the thousands before and the hundreds that will come after.   I'm actually looking forward to Monday and the work week. At least then I'll be able to stop thinking about myself and concentrate on the traffic that I have to drive through, the work I have to finish, or the drama that my friends are going through. Anything is better than thinking about my own troubles and frustrations.  F'it!

       I wonder if they'll remember?    Toby seems to forget the last good thing that he's gotten from you and he want's something new and now! Because it's been soo f'ing long, hasn't it?  Luci sees Toby and want's in on the action as well. I mean, why not, right?  "With the kids there goes the future! Little Busters!"     That's ok, I took pictures and I remember the fun I had with them, and I'll be sure to remind them of it just as soon as I learn how to speak dog (god?)  Golden Gate park is nice and all but I hate the fact that if you follow any of the roads in the park they all lead out of the park. It feels like they're telling me to get the F'out!   The Beach was great on Sunday. I don't think it's been that hot in SF for awhile. There were tons of people there too. I figured I'd lay out with the dogs and try to get some sun. It was so relaxing that I ended up staying out way to long and got a bit of a burn. My chest, stomache, and back have a slight redish tint to them except for this one spot on my side about the size of a small dog. I should get a marker and see if I can make a outline that resembles Toby's profile.   I also rode my bike from my apartment, over the GG bridge, and into the Marin Headlands. It was a nice ride and I didn't have any problems despite the fact that I haven't really been on my bike, on a trail of any length, in a few months.

       Fresh Cheese served daily at the County Fair   Fairs are great for a day of walking around looking at stuff and riding some scary carnival rides. The local yokels are also good for a laugh and you can always be sure the U.S. Military will be there in force looking to recruit more fodder for wars in third-world countries. As usual Marian has a in dept posting on the event, which saves me from having to write anything other than my opinions.    urlLink http://www.maybe.com/blog/2004/06/alameda-county-fair.html   My only problem with these fairs is the high prices of pretty much everything. I mean why is parking cost as much as admission? Also I'm not all that cool with all the livestock for sale that we saw. I can just imagine some kid going home with a cute baby chick only to have it neglected and dead in under a month.

       Beating the Pavement in New York (part 2):  Ok, I'm 1/2 way done, adding comments to the photo gallery of my NY Trip and I still have the 4 rolls of film I shot that I need developed and post. Cripes! I have a lot of shots. I'll continue to add comments until I'm done. This is by no means a chronology of my trip and all that I saw but it's a damn good photo essay some of the most memorable moments of my trip. I'm hoping to go back again before the summer is over so I can try to visit a few places I was too tired to check out this last trip. Enjoy! I know I did.   urlLink  http://www.standingstillinsf.com/blog/pics/nytrip/

        Burnt By the Son: Farenheit 9/11   Intense and informative movie with a definate left leaning bent but more than bash President Bush and the republican party this film reminded me that none of decisions made by this administration would have been possible if only one senator (Democrate or Republican) had stood up and fought for a recount of the result in Florida. Marian has a good post on the movie and I added my comments to that. Check it out at:  urlLink http://www.maybe.com/blog/2004/06/farenheit-911.html

       Supersized it... ( Reality movies are all the rage. )   I saw  urlLink Super Size Me  tonight and while I definitely found the movie entertaining and interesting I can't say it was by any means great. The premise is good: Take one healthy man and have him live on a Fast-Food only diet for a month and see what happens. The preparation and research was well done and there were some good interview subjects used but in the end I left the theater feeling the same as when I pass a billboard with one of those PETA shock posters on it. "Ok here's an fine example of extreme leftist propaganda that those conservative talk-show host always bitch about."   This guy took this simple case study in poor nutrition and took it to the absolute extreme. I noticed that most of the meals he ate included more than just a value meal (i.e. Shakes, deserts, and double the breakfast sandwiches), and of all the fast-food junkies they found to interview not one of them ate fast food more than 3 or 4 times a week, and here this guy is eating Mc Donald's three times a day.  Some of the finer points of the film were a little to brief for my liking. There's a great segment on the menus at some of the country's public school that includes junk food and processed slop. I think a full feature could've been done on this issue alone. Finally when the film ends and the director goes through a brief sermon on the evils of the food corporations and how as a country we should enact some form of legislation to force these companies to be more conscious of health of their customers I was ready to leave the theater and go eat some junk food. Which is exactly what I did. There was a Mc Donald's just a block away from the theater and I needed to get change for the bus ride home so I went in and ordered a value meal. I haven't been to a Mc Donald's in quite a while so I wasn't sure what I should order but I figured I'd try the Big Mac since it was a particular favorite of some of the people interviewed in the film.  I didn't supersize it though. I couldn't even finish it. The burger was mostly bread and the fries were way too salty, but I bought and then left the meal of my own autonomy damnit. Viva free will! USA! USA! Love it or leave it man!   BTW: I was working on another post about my trip to NY but I found that I was constantly looking back at the pictures that I took to come up with stuff to write about so I decided just to create a web gallery of all the pictures I have and write brief descriptions to each image. That I think would be better than writing a long-winded post that wouldn't really do the trip justice. Of course there are close to 200 pics so it's taking me a while. I'll post a link to it when I'm done.

       Beating the Pavement in New York (part 1):  Got back from Brooklyn and I'm Standing Still again…     But is this still San Francisco? I almost wasn't sure when I got out of the airport, caught a train to SM, picked up my dog, drove home, and found myself with at least 10 feet between me and the next person walking down the sidewalk along 4th ave. towards California st. and my apartment building. This place is a desert ( Ok well not a desert because it's too F'ing cold to be a desert, but maybe a fog covered field in the hills along the coast with a cold stinging wind blowing through it, ya! ) Anyway, that's the feeling I got when I finally made it home. I swear, after being in New York for a week, San Francisco reminds me of Bakersfield. A small valley town with more street corners then there are people to stand on them.   New York is saturated with people and the entire Island of Manhattan is a massive urban landscape. You'd actually have to travel 10 or 20 miles beyond the Island to find a suburb. That just blows my mind. I was a little put off by the massive crowds of people that I encountered when I got on the subway and this was at 10pm at night. Lugging around my huge travel bag and trying not to knock someone down was definitely a challenge. Especially after a long flight and adjustment to the difference in climate that I had to make. It was hot and muggy when I made it to the corner of Park West st. and Flatbush ave. around 11:30pm. I had to call my friends to come meet me because I would never have found their apartment by myself. The brownstones were squeezed together like too many books crammed on a shelf, along all of the streets that I looked down except where the perimeter of the park was and along Flatbush, which was full of businesses along both sides of the avenue. Crazy!   For the rest of my stay I was constantly amazed at that number of people that I came across as I explored the city with my friends. Almost everyone I spoke to had some kind of accent. I recognized most of them, French, Caribbean, Russian/Slavic, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Hebrew but there were some that I had no clue what country they came from. I guess I could've asked but my California, PC sensibilities wouldn't allow that ( Pussy! )   The park where we took Athena for her walks was huge and good thing to because there were so many people picnicking, flying kites or walking their dogs that if the park was the size of Golden Gate park we wouldn't have the room to look down at the grass under our feet. At that was just in Brooklyn. When I got to Manhattan and walked into Central Park the crowds were even more intense. Although my friends alerted me that that was probably because there was a parade running along 5th street that borders the east side of the park.  That kind of sucked because the police closed off parts of the park in an attempt to heard the crowds down the major roads through the park and away from some of the parks major attractions like the fountains and statues.   Ahhh, I'm done writing for now. Just check out the pictures that I posted on  urlLink ofoto.com . I'll come back and post more about my trip later…

       4 days in New York and I'm freaking tired!   I've visited Ground Zero, Wall Street, Coney Island, Central Park, SoHo, Chinatown, and Little (tiny) Italy. I've walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and I've been through every vein of Prospect Park with a bag of dog treats in my pocket.  When I think about it, doesn't seem like I've done that much but my feet sing a different tune. I've also got over 200 pictures to document my travels but unfortunately I can't upload any them yet because I forgot to pack the cable for my digital camera.   Anyway, that's about all I could write about. Sorry I can't be more creative or descriptive. I'm just not feeling very effusive right now. Know this, I'm with my friends and having a great time just hanging out. Can't think of anything else I'd rather be doing right now.  Oh wait! I should make some kind of response to the feelings I was having during my last post. Hmmm, how should I put this? Ok, I think I've got it.   " Shut your hole, you fucking pansy! It's a vacation and there are new experiences swimming around your every step. Enjoy it now, because you may not get another chance to visit the Big Apple again. I swear, sometimes you talk like the biggest wimp on the planet! "  Yeah, that about says it all. HA!

       Thinking of something to say...   Leaving for a trip to New York for a week, my mind is full of thoughts about change. I don't travel much and the reason is because I get a bit anxious every time I leave the comfort and routine of my day-to-day. I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I never returned. I ask myself "would you miss it?", "would it miss you?", and "outside of the routine, what kind of person are you?" I'm not so anxious about this trip this time because I'm leaving to re-connect with some old friends. If I could, I would only travel to places where I know someone so that I could experience a new environment while having something familiar to hold on to.  Oh, one other thing. Now that I've got so much free time I've picked up my camera again and I'm starting to find interest in framing and freezing images that flash pass me. Of course most of what I shoot is crap but on occassion I grab something that breathes and looks back at me with a purposeful stare. I'm looking forward to what I might find in a place with as much history as New York has. Should be fun.

       Zatôichi: Blind Swordman Comming To A Theater, Not Near You   So I was in the Bridge Theater the other day and I saw a postcard for the new  urlLink Zatoichi  flick that stars  urlLink Takeshi Kitano  (Beat Takeshi) as the blind swordman. Naturally I was stoked, but the film wasn't going to premier until July. The film is actually already a year old. I hate when films from Japan take forever to make it to the area. But then I remembered that Japan Video in Japantown usually carries films from Japan well before they make it to the theaters around here. I found this out with the Cowboy bebop movie. Apparently, subtitled version of most of the films from the major studios are released in Japan (not sure why this is but I'm guessing there's a substantial market for these films in Japan by Gaikokujin or non-native speakers?) and Japan Video imports most of it's rental stock from outside of the US. So guess what they had a copy of the movie already. SCORE!  Zatoichi is one of the old samurai serial dramas that originated in the 60's with Shintaro Katsu who perfected the iconoclast hero as flaccid and sometimes comical wanderer, traveling from village to village selling his services as expert masseur and offering a few words of wisdom to those that deserve it and a few strokes from his hidden sword to those that deserve it even more. The best of this series was the crossover film with a great duel between Shintaro's Zatoichi and Toshiro Mifune's Yojimbo. I don't remember much about the story of this film but the swordplay was kickass. That's usually the way it is with these films.   The New Zatoichi is pretty much the same fare except that Kitano adds his usual or unusual poignancy in character and situation development. Each of the main characters have, through some sad circumstance, found themselves in a small village where feuding gangs have brought death and despair to the hapless villagers. Blah, blah, blah. Enough about plot. The true essence of the film is the hacking and slicing of body parts into sashimi and this flick has the feeling of an all-you-can-eat buffet. The use of CGI effects for most of the cuts and blood-sprays are obvious but done with a great style of lighting and staging that you can't help but say "ouch! Sucks to be that guy."  One interesting part of the film is the final festival sequence, where an entire stage production and dance sequences turns into a kind of "it's all just for fun" exclamation to end the film on. I say it's interesting only because last month during the SFIFF I saw another current Japanese film about Yakuza warfare that ended in a similar manner ( urlLink Get Up! ) I checked the credits and noticed that the same dance group choreographed and performed in each film. I think this must be some kind of trend in Japanese films where, like in a stage play, you'll see the lead actors gather on stage and take bow after the final curtain. Not sure how I feel about this trend but in this case the dancing was good and the final scene with Zatoichi was classic Beat Takeshi so I can't complain.   Check It Out One Time Won't Ya!     Highlights:   Great subplot of the ronin bodyguard and the bokken-wielding samurai who disgraced him (but it's not that well developed. I had to watch it twice to catch real story.)  The cane-spear splitting swordplay where Zatoichi peels through the spear, the hands holding the spear and then the guy's chest. nice!   Another Takeshi moment where the gambler Shinkichi tries to teach a group of neighborhood boys how to accurately stage a sword fight with strikes in the right sequence to match his blocks (They don't get it). Ha!

       Monsieur Joey's Holiday: Day 4   Wow! You know being unemployed in San Francisco is the best... Well at least at first. I almost got up early today but then I just laid in bed, stared at the ceiling for a few minutes and looking for a cloud in the smooth, off-white lid on my little box I found another two hours of sleep. Kinda cool.  And then to work. Yup got to keep the ol' synapses firing. A scrub now-n-then, a few brush strokes up-n-down, and a wipe here-n-there, and I was ready to go! Take the dog for a drag (God is lazy!), dump a load of laundry and some coins in the machines but don't hang around for conversations, and then the work really begins.   Connecting... Authorizing... 00:12:19 and counting.  eh, that was a hour well spent. Now for some fun! No need to drive. Public transportation is just a block away... Ugh! some fucking joey puked on the bus! Next time I'm driving! ;  You know I never realized how close I was to the Warf. Kinda cool but who the F' pays $3 for a freaking birthday card with a crab on it! If I didn't have a gift card with a high balance on it I'd walk right out of this place. What a rip! Eh, I'll just hit the five-n-dime in my neighborhood. Oh well the trip wasn't a total waste. I saw lots of pretty-things in postcard settings and didn't cost nuthin. Should've brought my camera.  Back home, check the email. No job offers yet... Ok, guess I'll take the dog for another drag (Either God can't shot or I'm bullet-proof!) and maybe check out a movie tonight, hmmm? Monty-python's Life of Brian is playing at the Bridge. Is it some kinda new cut?  More later...

       The Apple bites me (kinda like it)     I thought I knew what I wanted but when it came time to make a decision about my immediate future I decided to go the safest route and take a job that wasn't 100% perfect for me. I think after a bit of soul searching I came to the conclusion that I'm not in a strong enough position to pick and choose the job that I really want. There's too much influence from people who only know me as a couple of 8 1/2  X 11 sheets of paper stapled and folded for convenience.     So now I'll be able to say that I've worked for two of the biggest software companies in the bay area. That's got to be worth something right? Actually I'm feeling very optimistic about the new gig. I always tell people that when your shopping around for something (in this case a job) you should go into the decision with at least three ideal benefits that will swing your choice to buy (or take) it. If you can say that you've walked away with at least two of the three then you've made a good decision. So while I was looking for jobs I had three general benefits that I was hoping to snag from my next gig. (Actually I had about 5 total benefits but I deleted two just to save on space. HA! I should be in politics.)       Decent pay/salary     A company located in San Francisco     Work that didn't suck    So using my fuzzy logic I believe that I've attained two of the above benefits. The pay is comparable to what I was making at my last gig and really I was willing to accept less for the right job. And I'll be working at Apple, which means I'll get to stay on a Mac and that to me "doesn't suck." Now the fact that I'll have to commute a whopping 100+ miles at day to and from Cupertino isn't all that bad.  *sigh*     Anyway, I'm not going to gripe. If I really wanted that job watching movies all day sitting on my couch with a comfy pillow nestled snuggly behind my back, I would've written more (or any) insightful reviews and mailed them of to the chronicle or some other rag. Ah well, it's their loss. Only I'll know what great flick  urlLink Suicide Club  was.

       The Perfect Job: Does it exist?     I'm begining to think no, but then I know that there are a few people who have perfect jobs. I mean I don't know any of them personally but I'm sure they exist. Like, I've said to a few people. I really loved the job I had years ago when I was working as a projectionist in a movie theater. But that wasn't actually a perfect job because I had to also manage the shift workers in the evening, most of whom were high school kids working a summer/holiday job. I also didn't get paid very much and I was going to school at the time so I was always stressed out about assignments and grades. Pugh!    So I was thinking tonight that maybe the reason I haven't found the perfect job is that I'm not suited to a job that I would like to have? I mean I went to school to become a filmmaker but when I graduated I spent most of my cinema experience working for free or for a catered lunch and I really didn't have the skills or the talent to make films on my own (or the money for that matter.)    Ok so that was my mistake, I know that now. I should have studied a subject that I could actually get a decent paying job in after I graduated. Next life, I'll know better. I actually do know a couple of people who are actually working in the field that they studied and got degrees in. So do they have the perfect job? You wouldn't think so by how much they complain about them. Still I think secretly they go to bed every night whispering thank yous into their pillows. Yeah.    So why am I writing about this? Well I went on an interview today. Now when I left my last job (actually I was asked to leave but no point in dwelling on that eh?) I promised myself that I would not take a job where I just didn't think I was suited to the work or the work wasn't suited to what I enjoy doing. An admirable motto in theory but what happens when someone offers you the possibility of making a decent salary at a job that may not be on the career path that you're looking to tread? Is it justifiable to forego your ambitions to pay rent? Eeeeh, I'd like to take the 5th on that question your honor, on the ground that I might end up bitch-slapping myself if I answer it honestly.    Ok here's a better question. How much should you suffer for your true ambition? Are poverty, sickness, and maybe even death worth the effort? Well that's not really a better question but I meant it as a better question that you can to ask yourself and not for me to answer. For example I had a conversation with someone recently where we talked about those poor saps, who traveled to Iraq to work (the civilians not the military. Fuck the military!) and ended losing their heads on video. Do you think if they had it to do over again they would have chosen different careers? I say no because after all if someone said to you "hey we have this job for and you get to travel to foreign places and experience different cultures" wouldn't you think "Cool man"? And then say while you were there you found out that there are some fanatics who are kidnapping people like you and killing them. Well you're already there right and after all the US military is there in force so you should be safe right?    Uh, fuck I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here. I think what I'm worried about is that if I take a job that doesn't fill me with excitement that I'd almost prefer having my head lopped off rather than getting stuck in a job that I just flat out don't like doing. No that's not it, who the fuck would want to get their head cut off?!

      	  		Adventures in Public Transit (or why riding the bus is both a blessing and a curse!)  	   Stepping up, onto the platform, through the folding doors of the #1 MUNI bus is always an adventure, and today was no exception. My trip started out simply. I was trying to get home after driving my truck down to Sunnyvale for it's 105k secheduled maintenance. I had to leave my truck overnight so I was forced to catch a train back to SF and then had to jump on the #1 to get to my apartment. I always take a book with me, but more often then not, I can't read because I get to involved in evesdropping on the other passangers. I can't help it. I don't like listening to someone else's conversation but, usually I do because they're just too loud or too obnoxious to escape my voyueristic attention.  	    Sitting in the back, on the left, window, quater of the seats that face each other, I opened my paperback copy of 1984 by George Orwell and began reading about the secret first meeting of Winston and Julia in the "Golden Country" where Winston likens their embrace to cross streams of water, swirling in a moment of friction and then flowing together into one (good stuff, man.) After a few more stops I see, out of the corner of my sight a very large girl, waddle towards me and flop on the seat across the isle from me. She's talking loudly but I'm not picking up any context because I'm reading. Then a smallish guy in baggy, white everything takes the seat right next to me, on the isle. Right off I knew I wasn't going to be able to concentrate on my book because the girl's words were starting to land in different parts of my head and I was no longer seeing pictures of two people making love in a field of tall grass but instead I'm wondering too myself "Just how big is she?"  	  		  			Big Chick    			...fucking drunk all the time...   		...cable car...fuck...don't need to drive, cuz it on a fucking cable...dumb asses!       		   			Little Man    			Ha! Fuck ya. Huh. 		      	BC    		...fuck...fucking...shots...fucked up...friends...    		LM   		ha.  	  			BC    			...fucking...Bonfire...fucking drunk...         Eh, you get the general idea of her conversational skills. I was just about to zone them out when the dude begins to spout off about this girls' friends and this I listned to very intently. It was classic bus talk.

       Which came first: Depression or the Bad Dreams?   "Life is Hard Enough When You belong Here."  When the mind falls down, why does the sandman have to kick it in the face?   I understand that there are some quite fine drugs that make you feel all fuzzy inside with continued use but who's got that kind of time or money? What a drag.   Oh well, let's just ride it out and then see what happens after a few days. Hopefully we can develop some nice Calluses and the blows will be numbed a bit.   I think it's times like this that Horror films were made for. Screaming on your own in public places can bring unwanted attention but in the murkiness of a cinematic fog just lip-sinc to the wails of the chick getting her throat cut.  Slice..."YEEEAAAGH!"  Feel better already.

       Left Them Behind (Thoughts of the past, during transition.)   Things are changing, shifting, and in some ways repeating for me now. New job starts on Monday. Time to meet new folks and try to get myself situated in a new environment. Seems like I just did this last year and then again two years before that. Jeeze, talk about "Standing Still!" Oh well no rule says you have to follow one set path on your way through life right?  I saw this film today: " urlLink Riding Giants ". A documentary (Man the documentary has come back with a vengeance recently.) by Stacey Peralta about big wave surfing and the people who defined the sport. You might remember the skateboarding documentary he did a few years back " urlLink Dogtown and Z-Boys ". Well this new film has all the style and storytelling but also manages to cover pretty much the entire history of surfing. This movie was sharp and some of the camera work and music make this documentary best experienced in a theater on a big screen. I was really impressed.  Anyway, while watching some of the interviews with some of these daredevil surfers I was struck but a sense that they all shared an incredible passion for their sport and unlike most athletes they made money only to allow them to continue to surf and most of them didn't really make much money at all.  I was really envious of this ideal of being so in love with something that you basically drop out of society to pursue a way of life that could potentially kill you on any given day. I know I've never had anything that I could say I felt that passionate about. And I believe that is probably the reason that I've changed careers so often and why I'm not satisfied with most of the choices I've made since leaving home to come to San Francisco and go to college. In fact I can honestly say that that was the last decision that I'm really happy with and, shit, that was in 1987.  The funny thing is that I noticed that most of the people I know are in somewhat similar situations. I wonder if it just a select few who have these kind of euphoric experiences with their careers/lives or if I just subconsciously align myself with people who are experiencing the same frustrations as I am.   So I'm going home this weekend. Back to place that I escaped from back in '87. You know inevitably I manage to run into some old acquaintances from what I like to call my dead years. And it's always awkward for me. They always want to reminisce about the old days and I so don't want to. I also get a sense that I've betrayed them in some way because I left and now coming back we have nothing in common and probably will never really be friends like we once were. I've actually had that same experience with some of the friends that I made in the Bay area as well. I don't understand why I seem to grow out of friendships so often. I have a feeling one reason may be that most of these friendships that I currently have are with people that I met through a job and once we no longer work together there's really very little that we have in common. In fact often when I get together with these people we usually on reminisce about the past, which I've already stated that I hate to do.  Ok, another thing, I noticed that most of who I would consider my "close" friends do not live in the Bay area anymore. And I don't see or talk to them that often so that when we do get together we actually have interesting conversations because we talk about current things. Anyway all of this is making me think that I may be a shallow person and I don't like hanging out with anybody too often or for too long because I just loose interest. What this says to me is that maybe my dead years didn't really end in '87. Hmmmm, something to think about on the long drive home tomorrow. Oh well at least I'll have the dogs with me and they don't give a rats ass about my thoughts. They just want their food and a grassy patch to piss and shit on. Ahhhh, simplicity. I wish I was a dog(god).

       To Drive or Not to Drive   Today I took a trip down to San Jose using only public transportation. Holy Shit! Did that take forever. Approximately 3 hours one-way. So here's what I did:    Jumped on the 1-line a block from my apartment, a little after Noon. This bus takes me all the way to the Embarcadero, with way too many stops along the way. – 30 minutes and $1.25 later I'm at the Bart Station.   Descended into the veins of the city rail system and floated like a red blood cell southwards to the Peninsula. – 40 minutes and $3.55. Shit, that was painful!   At Millbrae I can catch the CalTrain at the same station where Bart let's me out. Now if the first two rides were like pouring salt into my eyes (they were) then this trip was like scooping my eyeballs out with an ice-cream spoon. – 1 hour and ½ (should've been 70 minutes but guess what, there was a delay because some "police activity" in Palo Alto.) and I bought a day pass for $ 8.50    Ok so add on all the time waiting around for the next bus/car/train and I get into the San Jose Diridon station a little before 3:00pm. So now this is a bit extreme because I'm traveling off-peak hours and I'm going all the way to SJ when I would normally only need to go as far as Mountain View if I were going to work. But it's a good approximation of what my trip would be like. But what would it cost me if I drove the same distance? Kinda hard to say specifically but I put it as ¼ of a tank of gas (or $9.00) and approximately 1½ hours and on a good traffic day. I didn't want to figure in wear on my truck but it's definitely a consideration.  Well it seems obvious doesn't it? But just hold on a minute Joey. There are a couple of factors that I need to consider. I'm not the type of person that likes driving everywhere. In fact giving the option of driving someplace quickly or taking pub-trans and a bit more time, I'll usually opt for jumping on a bus. I like to read, people watch, and generally slack off mentally when I travel. But the difference in cost and time is pretty significant here, right? Well not necessarily, if I buy monthly passes and take the bullet train then, I figured I could end up paying something like $5.00 and take approximately 2 hours on the trip. That's not too bad, eh? Now if I took the advice of a friend and bypass the Bus and Bart and drove from my neighborhood to one of the CalTrain stops and just traveled on the train, I could still spend less money not driving all the way and make the trip last almost as short as driving only. This makes the decision much harder. Hmmm, well I think I should at least give it a shot and see if I can make it work.
