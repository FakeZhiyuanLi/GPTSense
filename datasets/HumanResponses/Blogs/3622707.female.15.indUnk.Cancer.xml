       urlLink    Vector  Posted by  urlLink Hello    People find vector as such a wonderful piece of art. I don't?! Seriously, what's good about them? Okay, I've tried it a week ago, I've experienced it. I guess it's quite addicting but at some point, goodness. You got to admit. You need to get a life! It's just overlapping colors to create a realistic piece of digital art. I'd rather use the picture itself. Vectors don't attract me in any way. Oh no, I'm not against it or anything, it's just some fierce wondering. Why do people find it so attractive and pretty?! Yes, it's 4AM I cannot sleep.

       urlLink    My mum's patchwork  Posted by  urlLink Hello    My mum made this for her bed long time ago.. I think it's already been 10years or more but it's still beautiful as it has always been! She is so talented. I admire her art skill through quilting, it is so hard to do. I've always tried to work with her and learn so that I could do the same for my kids when I grow up. Make clothes for my kids like my mum did for me when I was little, make bed like this one, and so on. I love this!

       urlLink    Qing from  Purifly   Posted by  urlLink Hello    Qing, she's one of my best online friends. I'm talking to her right now. Her dad unfortunately timed her internet connection to go off by 11.. But it's already 11:28 and she's still online, funny! Haha, she says her dad's timer isn't accurate at all.

       urlLink    Friends  Posted by  urlLink Hello    I'm the Asian girl in center. Gah, I miss school... It's summer vacation, alright. I have not many stuff to do, full of boredom. It's kind of late to realize I need to get a life! I joined Blogger because it's so nice and simple! But I'll see. I may quit.. This is so much better than LiveJournal though! I'd keep this as a photoblog, maybe?? Hmmm..  Well anyways, I wish I can meet up with all of my friends! There are too many of us, with our own different schedules.. We never have good free times, though there've been already 2 or 3 weeks, since vacation began! Usually, by this time I'd be back in Japan but I think I like spending summer here in the Philippines because I have my own room to chill in. Oh well. I'll go for now.. Bleah!

       urlLink    Good morning! again  Posted by  urlLink Hello     urlLink    My computer buddies  Posted by  urlLink Hello    I just had breakfast and thought this Photolog seems pretty good! I guess I'll stick to this, and blog more in here rather than my  Livejournal . Doesn't Blogger support SMS posting? I will be getting a new phone soon, so I hope that will work! I knew Blogger from long ago, but I never knew it had grown into such a good service! Thanks to my favorite search engine,  Google !! Woohoo. Gahhh. I took a random picture of me in my PJ's and my Computer Buddies. I just named them that now. They're always with me by my computer whenever I am online. The green ball sways its head with solar energy, and it's so cute!

       urlLink    Chevrolet Venture  Posted by  urlLink Hello     urlLink    The seatings  Posted by  urlLink Hello    We're getting a new car at last!! After 16 years of Cressida, we get a Venture Premiere from Chevrolet. I can't wait! We had a test-driving today and it was great. The car seems perfect. Though we are only three in a family, it's great to have nice space for ourselves, haha!

       urlLink     Finished!   Posted by  urlLink Hello      urlLink     Catalog Box above the frame   Posted by  urlLink Hello    &nbsp; This only took us four days! We thought it'd take much longer.. like the whole summer! We'd better go get a new jigsaw puzzle. It's so much fun. Hahaha! I was able to find plenty of pieces to fill in while my mum went to fix the laundries. And when she came back, (about 15 minutes later) she and I were able to quickly fill out the rest! It was so much fun.

       urlLink    Half way done!  Posted by  urlLink Hello    We were able to figure out some of the green pieces by examining the colors. It's so much fun and interesting to see how the image starts to become more visual as we connect the pieces slowly.

       urlLink    The start was easy  Posted by  urlLink Hello     urlLink    Getting a little harder...  Posted by  urlLink Hello    My mum and I decided to work on a jigsaw puzzle for the rest of the summer since we are so bored. I think it's great that we get to spend time together too. The border was very easy to find because all we had to do was find the pieces with a straight side. But as we got inside, it was a little hard but the animals were easy to find since they had obvious colors. The rest of the pieces are all green and hard to find!! I hope we won't die for difficulty tomorrow!

       urlLink    Nokia 3200  Posted by  urlLink Hello    Yay, my mum bought me a new cellphone!! It cost a bit too much for me, and my mum keeps warning me to not lose it. I will try my best to keep it safe with me and not get it stolen or leave it anywhere, where I cannot see! I love you mum! This phone is so lovely, I am so in love with it.

      So I guess I wasn't able to continue my blog entry the other day. It's already Friday (the thirteenth!!!), I finally came back home today.  I stay at the dormitory for the weekdays for those who don't know. I go home only on the weekends! It's kind of hard at the beginning especially for a forgetful, irresponsible girl like me, I forget lots of things at both of my rooms (at home and at the dorm), so things get lost almost everyday. This pisses me off. But sometimes, things are just simply stolen at the dorm by one of those dudes that come into our rooms to clean. At least this year, they don't go through every single thing.. Last year, they used to go through our closet, drawer (even though it's locked, they'd open it with the master key), our everything. So it was basically no use locking anything because by the time we were back from school, our drawers and our closets were always open, and quite obvious people went through out things. They'd actually go through irrelevant things, like my pile of photos.  Oh well.. This was done because a lot of us got caught drunk every Wednesday whenever we had the mall trip. It's really fun, we go shopping and everything. But we could get a little hyped up and all.  I have sooooo much more things to talk about... New students, new dormers, new teachers, new subjects and schedule... But I don't want to make this entry too long. Hmm.. Well I'll talk about my new schedule!  SL means Standard Level, HL is High Level.  I was thinking of moving up to High Level but then I'm so scared I might fail. My new French teacher sucks, I miss Mme. Gaillard (my old French teacher) but she left to a different school in Japan... The husband of my new French teacher teaches my P.E. class. I guess the Stennings couple are just too old and boring. Bleh. Mrs. Loeb is just as freaky as usual and Bob was really enthusiastic but I bet he'll just be as boring as last year. PHYICS. IS THE BOMB. And I'm serious, I love Physics, Mr Yap rocks. I don't know about Mr. Walsh yet because so far, we've been having substitutes...     Day A  Day B     Math SL Mr Cook (U401)   Literature HL Mr Walsh (U204)     Geography Ms. Herrick (M303)  Physics Mr Yap (S401)    P.E. Mr Stenings (Poolside)  French Int. (M401)    Art Mrs Loeb (S110)  Religious Mr Tiling (U302)
