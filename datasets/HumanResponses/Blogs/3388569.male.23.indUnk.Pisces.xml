       Concept Description:  	The idea is a Wi-Fi enabled MP3 player. The user can download MP3 song wherever he is as long as there is a hotspot. He can also download the songs from his own computer.  Some features of this product: 	1.Unlimited songs provided  	2.Smaller storage such as 64MB 	3.Convenient to use   Business Model:  	The unit can be pricing at $199.99.  The cost of the player will be the hardware and a Wi-Fi enabled adapter, and it will be about $75.  	    Source of Idea:  	My mp3 player only has 128MB memory. I find it is troublesome to clear up the memory and fill it up again every time.  	  Target Market:  	The teenagers or working adults, who like listening music with portable devices when they are on the way to school or company, can be my potential market. Wi-Fi technology is getting mature, and many people have already started to use a lot of Wi-Fi application with their laptop or pocket pc. Therefore, Wi-Fi is no longer new to the public, and people have already known the benefits of using it. The MP3 has a great market share now in the portable device industry, and because they are a lot of free mp3 downloading website online. But people find the storage space is a big problem of mp3 player. Hence, the Wi-Fi mp3 player provides a good solution to the problem at a right time.     Value Proposition:  	Most of the users of mp3 players’ concern about the limited storage space for the songs, and sometimes they want to change songs in the player but they don’t have a computer with them all the time. Therefore, a 24/7 downloading mp3 player straightaway solves both of the problem. A normal mp3 player with 128MB storage costs about $100 dollars now, and an Apple iPod with 20GB costs about $400. Just by considering the ratio of value to price, I believe many people will find it is good deal.    Opportunity Assessment:  	This product is in face an enhancement of mp3 player. There are a lot of mp3 player manufacturers and big manufacturers in the market now. Therefore, the market is quite competitive. The product might not be very sustainable because it also depends on the Wi-Fi technology. Hence, in order to make more profits of this business, I must try to cut down the cost as more as possible. However, it is still an attractive and latest high-tech product to the market.

       Concept Description:  	My product this time will be Bluetooth Eletrical Control System for house. Basically, what I want to introduce is a Bluetooth enabled electricity control box with a compatible remote controller.  	The control box will be the central device controlling every single power socket inside the house. The electricity cable from outside will firstly link to this box and at the same time, all the sockets inside the house will also link to this box. Each plug will have a unique ID which can be identified by the control box. The user can just use the remote controller to switch on/off the socket in order to control every electrical device inside the house.   Business Model:  	The control box with the remote controller bundled together can be priced at $499.99. The cost of all the physical hardware inside the box such as Bluetooth adapter, and voltage supplier will roughly about $200.   Source of Idea: 	In the large apartment, there are too many rooms with many electrical devices. For each device, you need to install a switch or a socket in the house, and you need to walk around to turn it on and off. Hence, I was thinking of something can control all of them remotely without making any move in the house.   Target Market:  	The Bluetooth technology just emerged and it was developing in a very fast rate. We can see that the world will be full of Bluetooth applications in near future. Many electrical devices are now designed with built-in Bluetooth adapter. Hence, the control box can be easily adopted by the public, especially the people having a large house or apartment. 	   Value Proposition:  	The benefit brought to the users will be controlling home devices in a much easier way. The user no longer needs to bother about moving around the house and switching on/off everything in the house. Moreover, the electrical control box is a necessary to each house no matter it has Bluetooth or not, therefore a Bluetooth enhanced box will make their lives much easier. For most of people can afford a large private house or apartment, they will not mind to spend a little more to get a more valuable deal.   Opportunity Assessment:  	In short term, this box can control the switch of each device inside the house. As the Bluetooth technology gets mature, and all home electrical devices such as TV, air-con, radio, cooking wares, etc. have built-in Bluetooth adapter. I can design a new box or an add-on to this original box to control the devices in a multi-functional way, such as change the channel of TV remotely. Hence, this control box has a very good opportunity for potential expansion.

       Concept Description  My idea in fact is a solution that gathering the traffic information by tracking the location of cell phone carried by the driver in the car. The system uses the cell phone as a locator when it is carried by a driver who is driving along the highway. All the telecommunication companies such as (AT&T or T-Mobile) have the ability to keep tracking of the location of the cell phone under the coverage of their satellite stations, so that every single driver along the highway is contributing the information. Therefore, based on the signal received by those companies, we can get to know how many cars are now located in any part of the highway, and then process and store the data in a data center, and distribute that data through a wide range of applications.    Business Model  In order to start up a business with this idea, I should go to patent this idea first as an application of GPS system. With the protection of the technology in hand, I can have a partnership with all those telecommunication companies that I license my patented technology to them and get the data from them. Based on that, I can start to develop all kinds of applications such as real-time traffic condition report, intelligent transportation solution, and sell it to the market. The cost I need for this business is to have a robust computer server in order to input, process as well as output the data, and the salary I need to pay for a few software engineers and marketing/sales men.    Source of Idea  As Prof. Babin mentioned to us that we are going to visit this company "Mobility Technology", I took a look at their website and got to know more about it. Suddenly I found that although their technology was advanced, but it needed very high-cost to build up the infrastructure such as the sensor and data transmitter servers. Hence, I am thinkig why cannot we come out with something will cost you nothing, but can do the same job. That is how my idea flashes my mind....   Target Market  The market is huge in the sense of everybody owning a car will probably use it to get the real-time traffic condition information. Therefore, I can sell to mass media broadcasting companies such as TV and radio companies. At the same time, it is direct to the public. The driver can subscribe the package of receiving latest information with his/her phone service company. In addition, my company can provide the solution of fastest way of going from point A to point B based on the current traffic condition, and either post it online or send to the customers directly to their cell phone. It is also possible to sell the information to the federal government for various purposes.    Value proposition  I believe the customer (the public) will find it useful because it is real time information. For those people often driving on the highway, they will most probably think of getting a long term package contract with my company's service. Moreover, it will be more appealing to those mass media companies because I can price it lower.   Opportunity Assessment  It is a new solution enhancing an existing solution which Mobility is using because it saves the cost and time for constructing the complicated infrastructure. It is also sustainable and expandable because the mobile phone technology is still under a fast rate of development. The unpredictable future of mobile phone may bring me a better opportunity.

      I feel that the stickness of our product can be increased by the good quality of the games. Every single user buy game console is because he or she likes the game. No matter how powerful the console is, if there is no good game comes along, the console will becomes useless. Due to the great 3-D visual and sound effect of Bluebox, the first game we are going to develop must be very impressive. If it successes, the whole business goes well. The game should be an action game which can show the full potential of the hardware. That will make our product different. Another way of increase the sales of games is to have a game in series. We can make new versions I, II, III... on and on, just as Final Fatansy Series in Sony Play Station. Once the player loves the first version of the game. He will most probably continue to buy the subsequent versions. Furthermore, we should produce more multiplayer game, as more people play the game will bring more fun. Hence, one buyer can bring another buyer, and the network effect can be created. It results in the great business.

       Concept Description:  	 	The product I am going to introduce this time is an Infra-red camera installed inside the car. The purpose of having this camera is to record the video of thief after he breaks into the car.   The camera is linked to a GPRS enabled communication box which is also installed in the car. Once the thief breaks into the car, the camera will take a 15 second video clip and then the communication box will send the video clip to the central data center.    Source of Idea:  	 	This idea came across my mind because my friends’ belongings had been stolen which they put inside the car. Hence, this system can help police to identify the thief.     Business Model:  	  	Basically, I will patent this application of putting camera with data transmission in the car. After that, start to develop the idea into the actual product. The whole package will be a small infrared camera with a communication box. At the beginning, start to sell the product to some companies making the car alarm system, and help them to integrate into their products. It will be sold in low volume at first with the price about $500. On the next stage, I can start to license out my technology for high volume manufacturing. The price will be lower for a large volume order. It can be $150 to $199. 		  Target Market:  	  	There are 2 markets I can target. One is companies making car alarm system, and the other will be automotive manufacturer such as General Motor.    Value Proposition:  	 	The system is in fact not used by the companies purchasing my products. Instead, the users will be the car owners. This system will provide them a better protection of their assets including the car itself and the stuff inside the car. It is because the information provided by the system can help policeman to look for the criminals.  	  Opportunity Assessment:  	It is in fact an enhance product to the current car alarm system. But the little value-added product can bring huge benefits to the consumers.
