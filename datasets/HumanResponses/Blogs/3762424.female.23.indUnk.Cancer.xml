      another soldier captured in iraq. blahblahblah, same old story.  i find it difficult to watch the news... yet, i'm addicted.  i read cnn.com like there's no tomorrow (which there may not be, all terrorists and wars aside) and my eyes are glued to the evening news.  yet, as i watch the news, i find it more and more difficult to watch and or believe.  i want everyone of our men and women serving in iraq to come home. now.  i cannot imagine the hell they are living at this moment, and i pray to God that it will all come to an end soon.   today, in an effort to keep myself busy and my mind clear, i went shopping.  shopping is something i don't do all too often, and when i do, it's usually at the local gabriel brothers. god bless the gabriel brothers, wherever they are.  however! today, my friends (and strangers) i went to the MALL.  whoah.  i proceeded to make purchases at old navy, victoria's secret, and american eagle.  5 shirts, 2 shorts, 1 bra, all for roughly $65.  not bad, not bad.  then, i ventured on over to gabe's and purchased mostly american eagle clothing, for a total of ohhh, $72.  so, according to my calculations, that's $137.  then it was on to target for some makeup and things. ehh, $29. grand total? $166. damn.   ok. tonight's mission. "stupid white men".  for real, this time.

      today is the day i created my first blog. ever. we'll see where this takes us.  wait...us? there is no "us."  i'm not giving this address to any of my friends (well, most) so instead of this being a little secret window into my head, it's...well, a window for myself to view...uh, myself.  why, you ask? (you being mainly people i don't know)...well, for the most part, i have a really hard time writing.  anything.  and it's not the fact that i can't write, it's more the idea that i have trouble viewing my thoughts on paper, in a permanent form.  it's a strange concept to me.  most of the time that i've tried to write, i scribble out everything i've written, ball it up, and throw it out.  now with a blog, it's not quite as easy to physically do that, now is it? (or is it?)  so, another rule of mine (since you're wondering), i'm not going to re-read what i've written until i've posted my blog.  this forces me to express myself without necessarily hitting the backspace, oh, every other line.  it's my own form of treatment, you see.  and now, onto the story of, well, this life.  today i pretty much sat around, all day.  wow.  i watched the real world marathon for about, ohhhh, 5 episodes...and got a little tired of the drama so now i'm sitting here with my back to the television typing away on my little apple powerbook which i love so dearly.  it's 8:19pm now, and i'm trying to decide what to do with my night.  running, perhaps? .... no. that requires too much movement.  hmmm.... a movie?  maybe.  i saw michael moore's fahrenheit 911 last night.  thumbs...up. i dug it.  so, another movie this evening? maybe. who knows. that doesn't require any movement, which might just be...not enough. what are my other options? the bar? no. perhaps... researching politics.... or i could finish one of the three books i'm currently reading.  i have the worst habit of starting a book, only to find another book that interests me too much that i then place down the other book before completing it, and the cycle continues. ugh. it's exhausting.  the stress in the back of my mind, like, "hey, i should really finish "timeline." oh, and "house of sleep"...damn! and "stupid white men"..." so maybe that's my answer for this evening.  hmm.....or maybe i'll just find another book to start.   i guess i'll let you know later.  take it easy.
