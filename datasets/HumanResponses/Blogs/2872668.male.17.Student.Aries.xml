						   This is my life...a life fraught with endless possibilities and dreams... Right now, I'm facing an identity crisis as I quest for the key to unlock the seal on my true personality... The solitary yet hopeless romantic, the Dreamer. The silent, perceptive mystic, the Seer. The hyperactive ranger, the Hunter.  These 3 characters make up my outside personality...servin to both conceal and protect the real person in my heart. Will I ever get through these guardians to unseal my true self...?  note: to read about my life exploits, look to http://sgstudents.com/forum/journal.php?s=&journalid=474&action=view

						   Tonite was kelly's funeral. sigh...we went as an og to take a last look at her. She was afflicted with leukaemia...terrible disease. What can i say? Death traumatises. There we were, stonin at the table in silence, unable to say anythin to each other. Perhaps we were ponderin about our memories abt her. But it was still a very awkward moment, and i wish we had talked cheerily abt kelly, instead of brooding to ourselves. It would be a consolation to her mom, at least.  Death. Is there anythin greater to be feared? I feel indignation whenever i see those interviews in newspapers n magazines and ppl say they're not afraid of death, that its all natural and everythin. Rather, the fear of death should be normal, and anyone who doesnt is either a liar, or dead by now. This fear propels us to survive in this world. Darwin said the need to survive initiated evolution. This can be rephrased to be the fear of death. This is what keeps us goin after our scholarships and distinctions, jobs and promotions. People fearin death invented seatbelts, researched HYVs, worked to earn money, and ate and drank.  I fear death. Yet even if it is all around us, we just have to keep livin and survivin. Rest in peace, fren. We'll be goin your path soon, too...   Hark! mere mortal,  dost thou fear of death? If thy answer be no, you surely speak in jest!  Thou wishst all of acquaintance good health and pain's immunity, to rest in peace upon the earth and lie in slumber for eternity.

						   Was studyin maths till 3am this morn...yawn. Then i slept for a few hrs, thinkin i could catch my pw meetin at 9am later. Big mistake. I slept straight till 9, when my pw fren's call woke me up...haha. Then i slept agn. Till noon. Darn.  Got addicted to playin a couple of pc games AGAIN...this reminds me of my sec3 end-of-year exam which i got 2 F9s for...nvm. Joo Fang mesged me durin the evenin. She was askin for help for pw, sayin she needed a Sec1 or 2 in the RI thru train. So i got her Yiling's bro, whom i remembered did not inherit her sis's genes n thus got into the premier school in s'pore. Think her bro's quite handsome; yiling said he doesnt look like her. Ha.  Tonite should be great! Besides the usual Jacky Wu shows,'Whose line is it anyway' is also on...its realli hilarious! "Welcome to 'Whose line is it anyway', the show where everythin's made up and the points don't matter...thats right, the points are just like the second person you ever slept with." After that i should get down to finishin trigo n the rest of the math topics...tom. I will (hopefully) start on the remainin physics topics...kinematics, uncertainties, etc.   Dost thou not see the light that glitters as so bright; Sleep not, want not, and then thou shalt reach an early end.

						   Mmm. Hope this blog is realli as secluded as i think it is...perhaps i do need some private space for my thoughts.  I realli hate her. This sounds like nonsensical rambling, since i'm supposed to like her...to love her, even. And perhaps I do. But i know i cant. Thats why i planted an artificial feeling of hate in my heart, to fight back the intense feelings i have for her.  Just talked to her over msn. Seems she likes the music of Midnight Garden, Hymm and Winter. Never heard of them tho....ha. She lamented abt her paintin cip...lucky i finished my 80 hrs already, yea.   'gd nite, sleep tight, and dun let the bed bug bite'...she's the second gal to say it to me...it triggered some vague memories n emotions in my mind. I...realli have to further reinforce the wall of hate in my heart, before im hurt...again...   Let amnesia strike thy lovesick heart, may thy mind lie within poppy field; for though the feelings of love be stark, requited affections shalt be few.

						   Man...supposed to study todae after a failed stay-up-all-nite study session...instead i got up, read the newspapers, n started playin Fallout1 for the rest of the day!!! Sigh...but at least in the evening i tried to study my Advanced Level Physics Txtbk as a last saving grace. Finalli studied all the CT topics for physics inside dat txtbk, includin mechanics, forces, moments, thermodynamics etc.   Still, there's but 9 days left to the CTs...and SO I've pledged once again, to dutifully complete a whole-nite study marathon tonite. Havent done it for a long time...miss me, caffeine? Time to get those fashionable panda eyes...heh. Tonite, I'll study the maths notes first, then finish the rest of some fiendishly diff. math xtra qns.(they reputedly took my fren 3 days)   Oh no, its 10.30...gotta sign off n start studyin. See ya.

						   On Tue morn, i woke up at a godforsaken time of 6.40, and sent joy a  birthday message. Then I slept till high noon, tumbled out of bed, and rewatched 'She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan 2003' (Legend of Condor Heroes). Meanwhile i completely forgot abt my hp....turned it off. When i finally finished the serial with the arrival of dusk, I realised my hp had a new message from her. 'Sebas?' That was wat it said. She must have asked to do somethin in the morn, but i didnt receive it. So when i asked her wat it was, she said it didnt matter any more...  Out of the blue, she mesg me to ask if she could call me then...then she suddenly changed her mind n said she'll call me tom., 'if not we'll be talkin till sunrise.' I'm sure...ha. Then she asked if i'll be home ard 12pm tmr. I said no...and she stopped messagin me altogether. I was wonderin wat to do...was I supposed to call her?

						   This very night, i regained both Joy's and Peifen's telephone numbers. Sigh. It was de rigueur though, so perhaps i shall be forgiven. Joy...i needed to ask her how to get to east coast park for tomorrow's CO barbecue thingy. Peifen...well, she was in my section and i needed to contact her to check some stuff.  But things didnt really go accordingly as planned. My first mistake was assuming that my call to joy would take 5 min. Unfortunately...she continued talking and talking, abt her schoolwork, science fair, busking activity, -PE-!, her sisters' dieting, gay marriages...and a whole fabulous load of others. Great. In the end, we spoke for hours again till nine, such that I had not gotten down to doing homework, while she had missed her dinnertime. In fact i was rather irked by this and thus i asked if she spoke to others for so long. She told me she only talked to her other close fren audrey (whom i know), and even so not as long. She said we didnt talk abt important things like her ideals anyway (i didnt get what she was saying but i think she meant i wasnt close at all to her). I was saying stuff like i simply intended to inquire the way to ecp, that was all...she said it was polite to catch up with me. Oh well.  In the end, I told her i'd call her around once a week. Just so she could have someone to talk to? and its quite relaxing to lie my head on the mahogany desk, slowly dozing off as she speaks of another world of experiences. I do learn and gain from socialisation.   'Learning is the only thing that never fails. That is the only thing which the poor mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.' - Merlyn, The Sword in The Stone.

						   Everyone around me is changing these days, it seems. Even Wudao is finding life boring despite a new crush (though his antics amuse me to no end), Khaiphang seemingly has some troubles with love, schoolwork, and even with a certain Patrick, Gabriel is descending into an abysmal state in his homework (due to Gunbound), Wilfred is apparently trying to catch up with his studies but undoubtedly feels the insurmountable pressure, Chee Keen is uncertain if he likes our class, Ruihong in a slightly nervous state (probably due to his studies), Jeremy with his adamant pride and still stickimg his tongue out when excited, Letian is still obsessed with volleyball (is he playing volleyball or is volleyball playing him?), Peifen looks doleful sometimes, probably just tired of seeing me, (a mutual feeling, i assure you) Wangyang and Gaoshan shows a new enthusiasm in their lives. ...  Me, I have just finished freezing my heart. It is so much easier to see how the people around me change while i am in complete still, like in a motion film... as though i were the eternal sky, watching centuries fleeting past and civilisation grow under my blue wings. It is time to put my acting skills in play, for everything that i do or say from now on would arise from a cold, still heart, which would be antisocial and unacceptable indeed. Therefore i still need to put up a front called 'Sebastian'. There is no emotion, just wintry indifference.There is no thought, only tacit judgement. My heart is silently abiding by my decision, seemingly saying something quietly in my ear. I can hear it now...the whispered words are,'I know what you feel.'...   I had to benumb my heart, that i learnt.   The sky worries, and grows solemn   whilst time, too, stops to mourn.       I congeal it completely, so shalt i stay sane   then I cry, 'wilt thy heart not blame?'   Out of the blue, i heard something faint.       The whisper to my ear did seem   Like echoed flow of silent stream,   Or shadow of forgotten dream,       The whisper trembling in motionless time:   'My fate with thine was intertwined,'   So spake it in my inner mind.       'No need for sighs and tears, nary a need to fret: Ay've served you well for 17 years, Ye may bide a wee longer yet!'       Hearing thus, i lie down comforted   and close my aweary eyes.   With my heart's compliance granted   I sleep whilst the sky laughs, and time flies.

						   Remember during june when joy asked if i was free to talk to the next day and i said no? She then ceased all communication with me for a week...it turned out she had fallen sick for that period of time, and was waitin for my sms, which never arrived due to the fault of Singtel.   This time, we've fallen into another drought. I havent spoken to or messaged her for weeks. Of course, now i feel nonchalent about it. My heart has fully geared towards my studies, perhaps due to surrounding incidents and my own incitement. Nothing provides a safer rate of returns. I reap what i sow. Strange that i've been reminiscing abt my ex-deputy headmaster's famous sayings. I've gained back a longlost part of my heart, and emerged stronger, seasoned from the chase. It has been a refreshing experience. She must feel the same.  &nbsp;  Now...i've deleted her hp no., plus peifen's home no. as well. There. No more silly distractions from my studies. Serve me right.    King Pellinore's after the Questing Beast  that gallops like the wind, in fog and mist.  The brachet follows after, yelping  with its tongue out, panting  and its furry tail, wagging  and the fewmets lie hidden&nbsp;to hint a tryst.   Sir Sebas's after the elusive distinctions  offered by thy Cambridge examinations.  Loud radio and&nbsp;caffeine come along  to help&nbsp;keep vigil all night long  yet remnant thoughts&nbsp;afflict&nbsp;forlorn  on yonder heart,...oh how it stings and burns!   D'ye ken me&nbsp;burdened with heavy heart,  D'ye ask ruefully,&nbsp;'how&nbsp;thou art?'  Oh, Ay'm obliged to say,  'Naw, my sprits are gay.'  yet in my mind Ay lay  in&nbsp;a lonely dream, in Joyous Garde.

						   'True love has no happy ending...for true love never ends.'  These eternal words were inscribed clearly onto the scarred surface of a wooden table. Near it, the letters LmY stood out from the random graffiti. I wonder. Coincidences are a God's work.   I reenter the room redolent of earlier times, of youthful exuberance and curiosity...of Innocence that is forever lost. The familiar objects lie in their usual positions, neverchanging, rotting silently. Warm musty air filled the room. A silence shrouded the room amidst the cacophony of a variety of musical instruments. I slip between the obstacles, reaching a chair and pulling it next to my friend. He sits calmly with an air of assurance, his head cocked up, his posture relaxed. Hesitant for a moment, I fiddle about clumsily with the Erhu, tryin to play remnants of songs long forgotten, as though recalling memories long lost.   ...did i ever escort her home? did she really hug my arm?...nothin but a bottomless, yawning ravine remains of my memories now. Out of the blue, I see her peeking around the door, seemingly contemplating the idea of coming into the room. Then she thinks better of it, and scurries away with her fren. I give a sigh of relief, as i come out from my momentary abode, meeting my fren outside. We stroll with a sense of knowing. She comes from the other direction. Renfang is, as always, squatting by her locker, doing a hundred things with it. I hurriedly kneel beside her, hastily picking up a common topic of ours. As we engage in brief conversation, she moves past me...my mind relaxes once more. So on, and so forth...staying as far from her as possible, even if it means squinting to see the scores...talking as little as politeness requires.   I...don't want to fall in love. The bible says, there is a season for everything. I know that Eden is not near, nor the lovely Spring, and chasing after the falling leaves of autumn hardly hastes its arrival.    When gentile poets with their fictions vain,  In tragic language and bombastic strain,  speak of heroes, maidens, and dragons alike,  surely there is little truth in sight!  Love is immortal, or so they say,  yet I beg to differ, I say nay.  Stirring feelings cannot be helped,  Yet brave heart, knight! and be stout.  The end is in sight, thou doth hear.  Diligence and honour shalt prevail.

						   Oh gawd yesterday was bullshit. I didnt brin the consent form for the SYF opening ceremony n was disallowed from goin! after takin all the time to get to sch!!! They even got me to cough up n return the free shirt! Well, it looks awful anyway. Haha...luckily, i was just in time for CO practice! We had some new song scores for nxt year's SYF. I was the only cello/bass member there again...Wudao was there too (ha, he didnt bring consent form as well...), but his skills weren't good enuf to perform in the main orchestra yet. Our conductor said i was rather hardworkin and a quick learner as well...heheh. Then he more than made up for it by criticisin my playin later on! Said he'll ignore me for now, since i was makin too many mistakes. Grr. It was my first time playin in a month k...  Sigh. Tomorrow i have one class outing in the morn and an og (orientation grp) outing in the afternoon. Wonderin if i should go for either of them. The class...i just dont like it. Yet there are so many nice ppl...Gab,Jeremy,CheeKeen,Renfang, just to mention a few...wat a pity, realli. And my og....its on the brink of extinction. We havent had an outin since once in term 1. How sad. Khaiphang is beggin me to go...so im unsure if i shd disappoint him.  I was on a rampage of playin games after the CTs...completed E.V.O. The Search for Eden. It left me with a dismal, depressin feeling. Survival of the fittest...i wonder. In the game i was evolvin to better overcome the opponents...yet wat abt them? Wat do the fish feel when they are eaten up? Do they have equal chances at the evolution cycle? Life is so, so cruel...Yet we have emotions to forget this core purpose of life momentarily. Whether it is happiness, anxiety, or sadness, they serve as a disguise. Bless the brain for providin us with meaning and nourishin the heart with hope. Nothin is worse than the absolute cold, heartless soul of the universe.  If there be God, I curse him.   Preposterous! Do you begrudge me life? Of beauty and warmth,ever tender to the touch. Yet fraught with hate, sadness, and strife... ...i see now. I would surmise as much.

						   Yea, national day...Im awfully loyal to Singapore. Note that this is extremely rare for a GEPper. Most of us abuse the country and criticise the government freely. Not without reason, definitely...after all, they actually spent taxpayers' money on educating a generation of PAP-haters (almost synonymous with Geppers) ! Haha.  Yesh, im really loyal to S'pore...in fact, if a war happened in s'pore, i would definitely contribute my money to the war funds...after i immigrate overseas. Oh well. Anywayz, i dont understand why but i just adore PM Goh Chok Tong. He just looks so wise and sensible, and seems like a person you can always depend on. Then again i dislike other PAP ppl like Lee Hsien Loong. He just looks, well, treacherous. Rather like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.  Actually, despite my self-proclaimed loyalty to S'pore, I didnt attend the NDP celebration todae. i went out with joy. We went around half of S'pore, to City Hall and its surroundings (CHIJMES, Raffles Hotel etc), to Bugis, its shopping mall and the flea markets in its vicinity (recognised someone from rj and zaoed quickly), to Bedok and the East Coast Park (found the route gaoshan and i took last week back to the mrt), and finally made our way back to Pasir Ris. And in all, we rode the Mrt 5 times, and travelled on a bus 2 times.  It was a rather weird time, as we were thinking of things to do along the way. In fact i was suggesting biking, rollerblading, billiard...but joy adamantly refused and bossed her way round to direct me to shopping centres and the like. It was really irritating when she kept asking me what to do and then decide everything herself. The original purpose of today was to explore places in S'pore we havent. In the end we were just disillusioned with leisure and recreation in S'pore. Sigh. She suggested we save money till the December Hols to try out a certain theme park that i forgot. It would probably be much more fun (again, according to her wishes).  I'm treating her rather like my female elder cousin, who brings me out to play, treats me to drinks and lets me relax myself. I like my cousin, of course. I dont really know what she treats me as. Probably just a friend. No matter what, it is all very enjoyable.   Ce n'est plus une ardeur dans mes veines cachee;   C'est Venus toute entiere a sa proie attachee.
