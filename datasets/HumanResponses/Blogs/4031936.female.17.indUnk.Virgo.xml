      So today I prolly had one of the worst days I have ever had....First I had a talk with Zack that didnt go so well...but then later that night he actually gave me some advice that would hopefully work to help me through this. Later that night tho the shit hit the fan...I was tired but I wanted to have fun and hang out with people. When I saw that one of my friends was down...I didnt try to help I just left because I knew that I wasnt going to have fun being around that friend. So I left and took Tim to his car so that he could go home. Then I went to his house. Tony called me and asked me what I was doing and I said nothing....I didnt tell him that I was over at Tims....I prolly should have. Then Tony Matt Chris and Kat went out to eat and someone started talking crap about me...Then I called Tony to see if he wanted to come over to Tims and watch a movie with us....bad move I guess cause he bitched me out....So they kept talking shit about me then...Some things came out that I never wanted Tony to know...but someone didnt tell him the whole story...which sucked cause then I had to tell him. I felt really bad for lying to him about not being at Tims....but now I dont know if I really have as great of a friend as I thought I had....The thing is I would NEVER EVER say anything like that to other people about her....NEVER...that is just plain mean and I know it....I just wish that she would realize that I wouldnt do that to her...She isnt the friend I thought she was....she is now treating me like she treated Michelle...and I dont know how to fix it....I dont think I have ever cried that much on the phone with Tony last night....We talked for prolly 4 and a half hours and got everything worked out between the two of us....but now I have to fix things with me and Kat....but how??     If anyone has any advice on how to fix this please please please comment on this page I need some help...Thanks Guys!!! *MUAH*

      So yesterday was the first day of band camp....and well it sucked a lot...I felt so left out all day. But then today was really good. I did really well and found out that I made rifle and saber today. It was awesome. The only two things that sucked were waking up so sore....it was horrible....still is. And the other thing was after camp it was all going great I was in the best mood ever because....well I just was. I was having fun and ready to have some more fun...then people just blew it. They decided that they had to do one thing and didnt want to change their minds about it and they had to have it their way or they were going to ruin it for everyone else....Really sucked cause Tim got really upset and I tried to help him and everyone else and I dont think I really helped Tim...but I know he will be ok sooner or later...just wish I could have helped him more tonight. Anyways I have to be up early so I think I am gonna get in bed....Im really tired. Night Kids

      Hi My name is Christy. I am a dancer and I am in colorguard. I did have a boyfriend his name was Zack.....Everything was great betweem us he was a great boyfriend but we just grew apart. Zack was always there for me when I needed someone to talk to...We had so many great times. Like prom.....prom was so awesome. Anyways enough about him....I go to Francis Howell North. I am going to be a senior and I am loving it. I have a great group of friends, Tim,Tony,Kat,and Matt. Tim is awesome...I can talk to him about anything and he can make me smile by just looking at me. Tim and I have a lot in common which is great cause now I know I have someone I can talk to about all of that. Tony is an amazing friend....I just dont know what to say about him. There is so much I could say. Tony has been there for me too for everything. I talk his ear off a lot...lol...but he does the same to me so....it all works out. Kat is a great friend too....I have known Kat for prolly about 4 years now. Kat has been there for me a lot too...She is a great friend that I can talk to too. Kat and I have a lot of fun just hanging out with the guys. Matt is a cool guy. He loves cheese....lol...which we found out we have in common. Matt is also someone that is there for me too and I know that he would tell me just how he feels about everything...which we found out hurts sometimes...lol but thats ok.... These 4 people are my best friends...I would do anything for them...best part is its the first time I can say that about people with out the fear of them breaking up with me....HA! Anyways Im done now....I will write more tomorrow

      This is what Kelly wrote last night and it really hit home on this... Happiness is just a figment of our imagination . . . It comes and goes in an instantBecause of an reaction Because of a person A lifestyle A choice It's easily added and removed Rarely staying If you've spent an eighth of your life happy Then you're unique It's something some have more than others It comes in spurts Sometimes in the rarest moments . . .In the middle of your sorrows In the end of a great beginning In the depth of the night In the darkness of the stars And even from the depth of a poem . . .Happiness is a thing you need Morphine for you pain Some are allergic Some are addicted Sometimes it's a last resort I dont know when either her or I will be happy again....but I have a promise from Tony that everything will work out....I dont even care about my own hapieness anymore....I care about everyone elses....Everything is falling apart and I feel like I am at fault here and I dont know what to do..I just want EVERYONE to be happy and at the same time.... So Kat....yeah...Kat doesnt seem to have any clue as to why I am so upset with her....maybe because she talked shit about me with who I thought were my great friends....but only one of those friends..(Tony) didnt believe a word she was saying about me. I told Tony last night that I know I said something about Kat....I said that she just wants attention...but that was because its the truth...But I would never say any of the things she said about me....and then she has the nerve to say that everyone else said those things about me and that she is sick of them saying that...Yeah right...she is the one saying all of that....I threatned to throw the knife....she actually took it and stabbed me with it when I wasnt looking....And then she has the nerve to say that she didnt do anything....She just needs to learn that I know whats going on I heard everything she said about me and I am NOT going to believe that she wants it to stop....I want her to stop stabbing me with the knife and look at what she has done...She has torn me apart and I dont know where to go....and the thing is...Tony keeps getting sucked in. And Matt...well Matt just doesnt care anymore...with everything that the two of us talked about....Everything is falling apart...Tim wont talk to me and when he does he yells,.....same with Kelly...and I know for a fact that Kelly doesnt deserve that at all....She definatlly deserves to know what she should do about Tim...whether she should get over him or still stick around for something to happen with them....and I want to know if I should just leave my feelings at the door and walk away or if I should keep them and make everything how it was a week ago....I dont know what to do I am so confused....No one tells me anything anymore...I am gonna go sit and think about things....Tim if you read this I am still waiting to talk to you whenever you want to....just no yelling please....I cant take that...I will write more later today....most likely
