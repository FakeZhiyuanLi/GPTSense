        Angela!&nbsp; urlLink     I went home this weekend to help my mom with some painting and redecorating. It was a nice visit; pretty mellow and relaxing. I got to see Ang for a bit - not nearly long enough - but then again I'll  be seeing her again in August or September in Montreal. I also added some more fundraising money to the pot, but I still have a long way to go.   A big hello to Jilly C who I haven't talked to in ages...good to hear from ya, it sounds like you're doing great!   I have a big family reunion this coming weekend which should be a blast. I'm sure I'll have some fun pics and stories next week...

      More like A LOT of gin and tonic!  I had a little party on Saturday night as an early birthday celebration...here's to turning 26! To Carolin, Connie, Brandy, Pam, Mel, Alex and especially Sunny (just cause I don't see you often enough), thanks for celebrating my b-day with me -- I love your wild and crazy ways! Oh yeah, and Anna came over too...a valiant effort but she didn't stay long. I hear Carolin's legs hurt from dancing on that chair all night...too bad! And if Connie and Pam had sung Led Zeppelin any louder we probably would have gotten kicked out! Anyway gals, it was fun. Let's do it all again soon for Carolin's birthday in August!

      Today I found out that I definitely have a leave of absence from work...phew! I'm very relieved but it's sort of a reality check. I leave in less than three months and there is still so much to do!  I've also started fundraising (I have to raise around $2,000 before I go) -- thanks Pammy! I am now the proud owner of seven rolls of pennies...woo hoo!  Time to try and organize some of my files so whoever takes over my job while I'm gone has some idea of what's going on. I guess that would be good because sometimes I feel like I don't!

       urlLink    The newest fundraising idea...&nbsp; urlLink      I had played around with the idea of making stuff to sell as part of my fundraising, but I just didn't think I'd have the time. Turns out I was wrong, so I'm going to be selling these cute little handbags. They are all reversible, and I'm selling them for $15...what a bargain! I don't have much stock yet (I only started sewing two days ago) but I'm hoping to have enough to start selling on Monday. Get 'em while their hot!

      The whole point of my blog is to keep in touch with everyone, but I'll definitely also be sending out emails and postcards while I'm away. If anyone out there would like to be added to the list, let me know! Please send your email address and regular mailing address (to k_stilwell@hotmail.com) so I can keep in touch. I mean, c'mon, who wouldn't want to get a postcard from the Caribbean in February!

      I attended a training session with Canadian Crossroads this weekend. I learned about all sorts of interesting things like international development, capacity building, sustainable development and poverty. I would have liked more time to chat with the other participants about their experiences (and logistics and practicalities), but overall it was pretty useful.  As you can see from my running fundraising total, I'm up to almost $800. A big chunk of that came from my family reunion last weekend. My aunt Mary organized a brunch and silent auction, where all my family members brought items. I think everyone had a great time, and it was obviously a huge help to me.   I do have to keep reminding myself that in terms of fundraising I'm not even halfway there yet. So I've added a new question to the FAQ's:  urlLink How do I give you a donation?  Thanks to everyone who has supported me so far!

      I've been getting lots of questions about my placement, as expected. So I decided to make up a list of  urlLink "Frequently Asked Questions"  so everyone can find out everything they want to know about my placement. It's waaaay down at the bottom of the page. Enjoy! And let me know if there are other questions that should be added.
