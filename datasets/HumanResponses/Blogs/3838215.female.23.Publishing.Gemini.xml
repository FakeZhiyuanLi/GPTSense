      In the summer after 8th grade I got blond highlights in my hair. That fall I got more highlights and then my hair kept growing and I had to keep getting more. I was caught in the highlighting trap. Only one thing in the world could make me stop highlighting my hair: money; or rather, the lack of money in New York City.  &nbsp;  I began my search for an affordable and talented hair stylist and after my run-in with a bitchy receptionist at a starting-price-$300 salon, I realized that not only did I need to find a cheaper salon, but I needed to choose between highlights or a bank account. It was time to give-up on being blond. A friend of a friend told me that a salon called Buni was inexpensive and it was in the village, so it must be cool. I called and booked the $100 appointment that would dye my hair back to the natural brown I last knew in 1995.  &nbsp;  I walked into the salon to find it empty. Not a good sign. An older man with no hair introduces himself and announces that he is my new hair stylist and has just spent an hour on the phone with Clairol discussing my hair. Definitely a bad introductory sentence to a new client. Before I could turn around and run, I was told to put on a white t-shirt and a smock because he had a tendency to stain things. Then, he and his mute assistant, started rubbing dark brown, smelly dye all over my head. &nbsp;I, in an effort to escape the fact that a strange man who had no idea what he was doing had my hair in his grip, read a book and refused to look in any mirrors. Two hours later, mute assistant washed my hair out, older man dried it while interjecting loud oohs and aahs and it’s-a-miracle-this-worked comments. I finally opened my eyes to look.  &nbsp;  I am now officially a dark brunette. I claim it’s black, but everyone else thinks it is a good looking dark brown. Sure, I scream every time I look in the mirror, but freaking out about my hair color is a lot easier and more concrete than freaking out about my life. And, besides, the hair will grow, the color will fade, and my life will  naturally  progress.

      Instant Messenger was a homesick pacifier that I was addicted to my freshman year. If I invested the hours I spent sitting in front of the computer IMing into hours spent studying instead, I would have been summa cum laude. IM conversations with my friend went like this:   Me: Hi  Melissa: Hey. What are you doing?  Me: Nothing. I’m bored.  Melissa: Me too.  And then we would continue to talk about nothing for hours. Seriously, hours.   The conversation with my roommate Cara went like this:   Me: Do you want to go eat?  Cara: Ya, one sec.  Me: K, I’ll IM our friends.   Of course, she was exactly three feet away from me at the time and our friends were across the hall. We were addicts.   However, the conversation with my ex-boyfriend went like this:  Me: Hey…you there?  (A minute passes that involves me staring at the screen waiting for a response.)  Him: yup Me: So what have you been doing lately? Do you like your classes? Oh yeah, I’ve  been wanting to tell you about my day today—guess what happened?! (Two minutes later)  Him: what Me:  Insert some incredibly long story that I hope makes my life sound really fun and important.  Him: cool  Throughout the conversation I am shaking with anticipation, running around the room, IMing Cara excerpts of the IM conversation as they happen. Sickness, I tell you.  The good news is that I got a life freshman year and dropped my Instant Message addiction. But like all true addicts, I just had a relapse. Last night, my friend brought up an Instant Message conversation she just had. I said, “Instant Messaging is so freshman year. No one I know could possibly still be on that…Could they?” I looked back down at my magazine and assured myself that I did not need a fix.   An hour later, I downloaded the program. And I was right! Not one of my friends was on instant messenger. But unfortunately, my ex-boyfriend was. I would not be surprised if when hovering your cursor over his screen name it revealed that he had been officially signed on for 5 yrs, 1 month, 14 days. Against all logical efforts to stop my hands, I sent a little, innocent ‘hey’ to the ex. And then that innocent ‘hey’ turned into a full-on instant message conversation. Sure, it was an addict fix of the worst kind, but I experienced none of the usual side effects. No shaking. No running around the room. No IMing excerpts to anyone. I realized that I did not even prepare a story to impress him. I believe I just may be over him—instant messenger, that is.

      So tell me again why I do not have a fabulous apartment with a closet of shoes? Or even a complicated love life that borders on wrong yet everyone still likes me? And where is my spacious apartment? I predict that the reality of my looming homelessness and unemployment will soon set in. But before it does, if anyone sees Sarah Jessica Parker, please let her know that I am currently available to housesit.

      I looked in the mirror to face myself yesterday and I thought about how I forgot what I really looked like. Walking down the street, I had this image in my head of what I must have looked like as I walked. Then, I got back to my apartment and looked in the mirror; I looked nothing like the image I had envisioned in my head moments before. I harbor an imaginary self and I have absolutely no idea how close it is to my true image. I feel, especially in this move to New York, that I spend a lot of time trying to remember who I am and who I want to become. This new environment dictates a daily life that I must adjust to, but how do I retain the parts of me--my look and my personality--that don't belong here?

      I'm on an old warehouse rooftop in Brooklyn with two transvestites and one guy doing PCP. Remember how a month ago I was drinking lattes at Toast in the LA sun?

      Nodding to the beat, I stood in the old church-converted club called Avalon. Grotesque how flying buttresses lead my eye to racks of grey goose. The DJ’s in a modern pulpit as he manages to convert quite a few just-turned-18ers into zealous beat trancers on the dance floor below. I was outside on the now-a-smoking porch but once the old church cemetery (the irony of smokers on top of graves is overlooked) when a Russian chemist approached me for a light. He wasn’t actually a chemist; in fact, he probably just finished a chemistry class in community college. But, since we were in church, I let him prophetize. The truth is: I was bored and keeping up a lie with a stranger is fun and easy—especially when the stranger is a pretend Russian chemist who probably has been mixing up some special drug cocktails in his laboratory/dorm room earlier that day. Unfortunately, the alter-ego cannot keep up his crazy lie throughout the night. I find out that his name is Emo, like the Pixar fish without the ‘n’, he says. I ask him about his eyebrow piercing, his family, his favorite clubs in the city. Do all bar conversations go like this or is it just mine? Soon, he confesses: He lives in Brooklyn with his mom. He takes the Brooklyn Express into the city on Saturdays with his brother. He wants to be a pharmacist. Wow, now that is boring. With his mystery lost, he realizes that he may as well make his move. He seems nervous as he leans toward me. He pulls my hair away from my face and tucks it behind my ear and then nudges my chin so that I will look up at him. And as he brings his mouth to my ear he says, "listen, I'm only 18, will you go over to the bar and buy me a drink?"

      I haven't slept for two nights. Ok, slight exaggeration, so I'll explain: I really haven't slept well for two major reasons. Night 1: No air-conditioner. On Saturday, I woke up at 11am hungover. I rolled onto my side, grabbed the vibrating phone that would inevitably force me to talk to my mother, and saw that, yes, I had to pack my belongings and check-out of the dorm by noon. One hour: no problem. By 12:15 I hailed a cab and $10 later, I dragged my stuff up the 2 flights of stairs and into my tiny NY apartment. Unpacked in two hours: sure, no problem. I climbed into bed, pushed down all the covers with my feet, tore off my t-shirt, sprawled out, and wiped the sweat off my face.  Eight hours with no air conditioner: major problem. On Sunday, I walked 10 blocks to the store, dropped $80 on a 'slightly loud, but functioning' AC, once again grabbed a cab, heaved the box up the stairs and managed to install it without dropping the entire thing out the window. Cold air on my body for hours and hours to come: no problem! But wait, you say, why two nights of no sleep?  Night 2: Crazy amounts of nervousness before my first day of my new job. When you are a kid there is one night of the year that you will inevitably be restless and wide-eyed: Christmas Eve. No matter how many times mom says that Santa will not come until you fall asleep, the fact that there will be tons of toys in the morning is just way too exciting to allow any inkling of tiredness. This is basically how I felt on night 2. I am so excited about my new job, which, of course, makes me nervous about the big first day and all of the first impressions that come with it. Oh, the pressure and the endless rolling over and position-shifting.  The first day went great, full of good impressions. But, that's another blog. For now, I must start Night 3. Goodnight...I hope.
