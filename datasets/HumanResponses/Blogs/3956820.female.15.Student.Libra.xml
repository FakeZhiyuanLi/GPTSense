       i had quite a day today....  i was eating my breakfast with my cousin. she was staying in my house cos she was working but she went home today. anyway we were eating, as you do, and all of a sudden she had a fit. i was soooooooo scared and freaked out. i was so lucky that my mam wasnt working today and she was in bed or else i would have been on my own with no clue what to do. she is ok now!! in result of that i was late for work but it was alright!! i had an ok day but one of my kids had a HUGE tantrum and said he wished he was dead.....i hadnt a clue what to do!! i would have been grand with him but A.C was there and i wanted to look good!! but i was ok in the end!!  lunch was terrible, i was jumped on several times!! my back is really sore!!  then we had the mini league semi final and final which dublin won!! then the waterfight and im now im soaked and cold but i've no energy to change my clothes or shower!!  i'll be done now!!  slan

      *BIG sign*  Topic: Boys  they are so confusing. i have so many things running through my head and its all due to one boy! if only there wasnt a little problem (he has a very good point), i'd be with him or is it he'd be with me?! i've lost track. anyways, i sent him my conversation with his mate and asked if it was true and it was. i dunno what to do now. he means alot to me but............i dunno!!!! why do boys do this?! do they hate us?! no. to mess with our heads?! well he aint the type to mess with my head. in some ways i wish i never found out how he feels but in other ways im glad. i barely slept last night cos i couldnt get him off my mind. he told me not to stress about thinking but no matter what i do, i cant stop thinking about him.....  ugh, i think i'll go and ponder in my thoughts again slan
