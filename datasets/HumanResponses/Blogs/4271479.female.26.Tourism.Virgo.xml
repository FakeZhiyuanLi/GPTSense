       … I'm starting this blog on a whim. I mean, every other damn person has one, so why not me? If Jane P. Teenager can post blog entries about her ill-advised sexcapades, then why not me? I mean, not the sexcapades but … never mind. I'm entering into a new chapter in my life and thought it might be a good op to get down on this "blog" phenom. We'll see.  Anyway, so I guess I should give a bit of background here. My husband Victor and I moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico from New York about a year ago. We moved for a bunch of reasons; NY was just getting too expensive, we needed a change of pace, Victor grew up in New Mexico, my sister lives nearby ... the West was calling.   Santa Fe is kind of a riot and a half. Green chile abounds, and almost any type of restaurant will include it in their menu. "Green chile on your asparagus, ma'am? How about in your meatballs?" "Want any green chile in your California roll?" "Coffee ice cream? Ok, and green chile on that for ya?"  The Santa Fe accent is fairly entertaining, too. My friend Amy, another transplant, and I realized at one point that for some reason they have a lot of the Minnesotan accent in there ("oooh ye-ah, shur"), mixed with a Hispanic accent and then some other stuff that we frankly just can't quite place. It's really odd … and somewhat infuriating when you're at the DMV.  Santa Fe is almost too easy to make fun of, especially when the fact is that there are a lot of things to like about it. It's full of all kinds of folks -- artists, politicians, environmentalist hippies, cowboys, East-coast-transplant-cowboy-wannabes, and lots of people from Chicago. For some reason, SF is a mecca for Chicagoan escapees. And SF's a tourist town, so there are always all kinds of people coming and going.  There are two problems with SF, as I see it. The first is, it's a solid 890 miles from any major body of water (sorry, Utah; Salt Lake doesn't count), and, for a gal who grew up in Rhode Island -- the state whose nickname is actually "the Ocean State" -- that can be disconcerting. When you grow up near the water, its absence can be felt immediately and keenly. At times I'll be driving around in NM and feel as though, as soon as I get over the next set of hills, the ocean will be there; this region's wide-openness somehow gives me that sense.  However, that's a problem that can be dealt with; yeah, I miss being near the water, but hey, I love the mountains and the foreign terrain, and you just focus your energy and attention elsewhere when you start feeling the water-lust. The other problem here in SF is more practical and less easily overcome -- there's not a ton of industry here … or at least, not in "my field" (whatever that is, considering I was an English major in college).  Victor found work in the financial field via his NY contacts, so that worked out pretty well, all things considered. When I lived in NY, I was working for a publishing company, but when I got out here, I honestly wasn't sure I wanted to bust my ass trying to find another job in what was a pretty limited industry out here. I never felt that thing of "oh my gosh, I just love my job" when I was in publishing.  The fact is I never felt that way about any job I ever had.  So when I arrived here, I was really kind of swimming around in limbo. I was 26 years old and I just didn't really know what I wanted to do with myself. I think it was pretty clear to everyone who knew me that I was in a funk, and not the good George Clinton kind of funk. Victor seemed worried about my state of mind, and was trying to help me figure it all out. One day we were talking about my interests and what I felt passionate about, and he mentioned the pipe dream we'd always had together about opening a restaurant someday. He correctly pointed out that I was never so pleased and happy as when I was in the kitchen, preparing a meal that I knew the recipients would enjoy. And that's when he suggested that I consider going back to school and getting a degree in culinary arts.  He was right -- cooking is something I've always loved and the fact is that I already have a great base of knowledge in the subject because I grew up in a very "cooking" family. When Victor and I graduated from college and were preparing to move in together, my grandparents presented Victor with an apron and a set of oven mitts, with a card that said "Victor, get ready -- this family COOKS!"  But I was resistant. It's a huge change, and I was scared of quitting what I knew, making less money, and just "trying something different" (I'm putting that in quotation marks because I'm actually quoting from my personal mental Big-Three List of Things I Fear, along with driving next to mac trucks and traveling by plane).  The more I thought about it, though, the more I knew he was right. As professions go, it’s one that I can see myself actually having fun doing. Victor and the little pep-talk dude inside my head (who can usually be found hiding out behind the medulla oblongata having a nap) kept telling me I could do it, and finally, I believed it.  So I quit my job and took a job working in the kitchen at a café here in town, which has been a great experience. Already I've been given a good deal of responsibility and trust, and I feel like I'm learning a ton. And this Monday, I start classes at SF Community College, which has a pretty darn good CA program.  It's an exciting but a little bit scary time, and I think having a forum to put it all down in will help me get through it. So here goes -- I'll keep you "posted"! (Get it? Puns are awesome.)
