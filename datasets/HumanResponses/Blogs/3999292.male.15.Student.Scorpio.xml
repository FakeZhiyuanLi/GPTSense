      Well, i'm taking off on a canoe/camping trip with tristan, you know, the one with the animal in his head. Anywas, it's just me and him for the next three days, alone, in the middle of no where. I know I know, sounds like a bad gay porno plot right? Well you sick ass fucksticks, I'm completly not gay, like not at all. Tristan, i can't trust him. He's SO on the other side of the island. Anyways, when&nbsp;I get back, i'll give the low down. For&nbsp;the highest&nbsp;humiliation level on tristans part, i'll give you the 100% full story on his fuck ups. Be Back Tuesday night.

      Today i found this in the one and only Comments  1 Comments: Anonymous said...  your site is pretty crazy shit kevin!!:P but i love it its weird like you. cant wait to see the new postings Love Your Girl  12:12 AM  Love Your Girl? I'm Fucking SINGLE!!!! This truely puzzles me, first of all, not many girls that dig Teh Rob call me by my horrible other name. Although miss Anonymous my not dig me at all. Or may not even be a miss, even a MR. Someone is either obsesed with me, or is just trying to fuck with my head. If someone is trying to fuck with me it's working.  Who Are You Anonymous? Who The Fuck Are You? MSN works for a great telling point. Crazy bitch.

      "fuck off" i moaned when my friend attempted to wake me up. "FUCK OFF" i said again. "I SWEAR TO FUCKING GAWD I WILL FUCKING KICK YOU FUCKING LITTLE ASS IF YOU DON'T FUCK OFF!!!!" I screams at him. I was finally answered with "Dude, some girls on the phone and it's 4pm" "Oh thanks man!" i replyed to my wonderful counterpart. It was a girl on the phone, how could i not get up? So i got up, went up stairs and found out the 'girl' was my mom. First instinct, kick tristans ass and get food.

      It’s a few hours after 12:00 in the am. According to the clock and what everyone tells us we have entered a new day. Although, in some other parts of the world that happened hours ago, or will not for a few more. Though I don’t feel it, hear it, or feel it, I am told it's a new day. But what if it’s not really a new day, sure time is a universal thing these days. But what if this who thing called “time” is really none existent. What if it’s not a new day at all. What if it’s something else. Something much, much bigger. Everyone on earth asks at one point, ‘why are we here’ or ‘how did we some to be’ even ‘is there a something after life?’ Questions unanswered, questions that will never be answered, in this life time anyway. Our humble home that we call earth is just a speck in our galaxy, even that is just a speck in the universe. One only realizes how small we really are until they think about ‘the big picture’ Some days I just sit and listen to the trees wondering, ‘is this life, or is it apart of something bigger?’ No friends I’m not talking about heaven or hell. I’m talking about, is this real? Is this whole thing real? Or is it just a dream… Something we do not figure out until our part in this picture is over. Is this whole thing called life real? Something you should think about.  Until next time Rob.
